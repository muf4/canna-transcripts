from uh around 2000 I think uh I was

33
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,239
no idea how the internet worked at that

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,799
time uh and I was going on a road trip

35
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,478
so my girlfriend wanted me to set up uh

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,040
an

37
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:33,438
email and tried rob you know a few

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,399
variations of my name and uh then I

39
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,798
looked down I was eating a sub sandwich

40
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,478

Rob from the sub sandwich yeah that's

42
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:46,920
literally where it came

43
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:50,519
from until a few years later when I

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,560
learned how to Google and I googled sub

45
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,438
robob and a whole different sub Rob came

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,840
up under

47
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:03,118
images uh some dude in leather who was

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,960
submissive sweet sweet submissive Rob so

49
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,280
the first chance I got it I changed to

50
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,679
seat trip yeah yeah I like I like

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,640
submissive Rob better though yeah good

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,920
for him but you know it just wasn't my

53
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,518
trip Daddy I didn't think about the

54
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,399
submissive thing at all I was thinking

55
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,439
like sub Rob like less than Rob which I

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,879
thought was really funny well you

57
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:32,560
know with that idea but no it was it was

58
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:36,318
literally a sub sandwich Submarina in

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,840
specific for those oh [ __ ] that's right

60
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:42,199
yeah that's good [ __ ]

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,479
too that's funny dude that's hilarious

62
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,479
okay

63
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,200
so go ahead thousand no I was gonna say

64
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,079
so you saying that was around 2000 um

65
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,119
were you growing

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:01,519
then yeah I started

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:03,719
growing fulltime in the early

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,480
mid90s uh in

69
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,799
Portland uh I had gone home for the

70
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,719
first time to Alaska to

71
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:16,319
work and uh I went ahead and grabbed old

72
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,799
blueberry um clone that had that's been

73
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,719
floating around Belta since the early

74
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:25,799
80s at least yeah down to Portland and

75
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,639
and started growing full-time down there

76
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,640
so when you start you you mentioned

77
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,518
Alaska let's start there if we can so in

78
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,438
Alaska during during your years growing

79
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,039
up there you know you mentioned earlier

80
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,479
that like it was more legal in Alaska

81
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,639
than it was the rest of the states what

82
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,280
kind of stuff were you seeing when you

83
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,359
first started

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,799
smoking well nothing really had names

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,120
back then at least not our Circle we had

86
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,920
some names just to differentiate the

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Growers like Bruce's Halloween bud you

88
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,399
know

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,560
Mike's Mike's greenbud you know [ __ ]

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,438
like

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,640
but and of course Blueberry Blueberry

92
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:09,598
was the first one that ever had just a

93
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,958
specific moniker that I came across yeah

94
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,679
that was pretty self-evident why I mean

95
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,280
it's that was that that's a crazy cut

96
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,639
still going evidently yeah is you

97
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,879
referring to Old Blue old blue Alaska

98
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,400
blue that's right I was watching one of

99
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,399
the one of the podcasts last year and I

100
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,319
was in the live chat and somebody

101
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,359
hopefully F he's watching he or she is

102
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,680
watching

103
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,800
now uh mentioned they were from North

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,199
Pole which is right up the road by

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,280
Alaska standards Delta yeah and uh he

106
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,240
asked where I was from when I mentioned

107
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,159
I was from the interior and I said Delta

108
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,400
and the first thing he did was type in a

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,919
few blueberry emojis oh wow that's 2022

110
00:04:53,399 --> 00:05:00,120
first time I smoked that cut

111
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:03,159
was probably 82 so 40 years later the

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,680
same cut is still synonymous with my

113
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,000
hometown so that predates DJ Short by

114
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,720
quite a

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,199
bit uh probably but I mean I personally

116
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,280
have always thought just like skunk that

117
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:21,439
you could find Blueberry in I'm sure can

118
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:23,359
Afghan seed lines yeah no it makes sense

119
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,240
makes sense it's just so cool to see

120
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,759
something like that back

121
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,038
then what's that it's so cool to know

122
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
that there was something like that back

123
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,478
then that was and called blueberry at

124
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,199
the time because of its sense yeah I

125
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,639
mean I was in high school when I first

126
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,199
scored blueberry it was probably

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,680
freshman or sophomore year so that would

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,360
have been that would have been 84 or

129
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,280
85 and the people I got it from talked

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,479
about it like it had been around for a

131
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,478
while so that's

132
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,080
wild I don't know start start his

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,639
blueberry line uh I know he he first

134
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,639
started selling it in mid 90s

135
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,360
so selling it but God knows what you

136
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,360
know I don't know how long ago he worked

137
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,439
it and let stuff out or clones out but

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,240
who knows on that to be honest yeah and

139
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,918
I have no doubt I don't remember

140
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,400
seeing when did The Seed Catalog start

141
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,639
showing up in High Times 85 was the

142
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,638
first

143
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,599
time I want to say that was I want to

144
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,720
say that was the one where um they were

145
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,519
putting like after 1 Afghani 2 from Sam

146

the skunk band that quick little list of

147
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,159
skunk one and stuff like that I don't

148
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:41,680
know where anybody would have gotten any

149
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,319
commercial seed in the interior of

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,038
Alaska in the early 80s you know what I

151
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,879
mean now we had lots of seeds there was

152
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:53,959
a lot Mak sense there was a lot of

153
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:57,519

growing up

162
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:26,119
but clones really took hold in the mid

163
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,520
80s yeah around where I was from

164

00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,918
up well going back to strain names

169
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,680
nothing really had a strain name back

170
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,079
then yeah back then everything that came

171
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,840
from the valley and I'm sure not just

172
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,198
the valley being matusa Valley yeah not

173
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,878
matusa Valley probably Anchorage and

174
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,879
Palmer and was probably every everything

175
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,439
was called mat NSA [ __ ]

176
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,240
especially during the summer uh when

177
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,439
tourists around oh I bet I

178
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,199
bet but other you know other people have

179
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,839
commented on some of my posts and

180
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,319
threads that they've never smoked the

181
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,878
same Thunder [ __ ] Yeah have commented

182
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,759
that they've never smoked the same

183
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,919
Thunder [ __ ] twice you know yeah that

184
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:22,120
makes sense I wonder why it took cold

185
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:27,359
though any idea look man skunk when did

186
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:30,519
skunk number one become a strength uh

187
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,200
78 okay well that that nips that

188
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,879
argument in the bud right there because

189
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,158
I was going to say skunk was a term

190
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,838
before skunk number one but oh yeah yeah

191
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,399
know everywhere I lived whether it was

192
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,000
Oregon Alaska

193
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,000
California and this is all pre- internet

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,440
everybody use the term skunk you know

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,399
Maui wild there's there's 50 different

196
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,360
strains named ma

197
00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:00,480
absolutely that is the real deal MTF or

198
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,159
the real deal Maui wow but once people

199
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,519
start using the name you know fast

200
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,879
forward 20 years later who's to say what

201
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,078
is what you know yeah right it's lost in

202
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:16,360
the mix people didn't trade strains a

203
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:19,039
lot back then there were certain small

204
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,000
groups that you were basically well in

205
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,838
in my situation it was it was who your

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,759
parents knew you

207
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,320
know out with that's where you got to

208
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:33,159
cut if you got to cut at all so I just I

209
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,560
I don't think MTF has been a strain

210
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:39,639
specific name since probably

211
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,159
the80s yeah every grower in the valley

212
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,639
and I used to go down I lived in

213
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,719
Anchorage for a couple years and which

214
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,240
is close to the Bley and the friends I

215
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:54,079
knew who grew down in that area were out

216
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:57,440
in matusa Valley everything was matusa

217
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,919
everything Mar bro don't sweat it

218
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,200
because if somebody gets a cut from

219
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,679
Alaska

220
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,560
that's worth you know making a hybrid

221
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:08,479
out of or a poly hybrid out of it's

222
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:12,679
pretty good it's probably a pretty damn

223
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,800
good cut yeah I never had bad weed until

224
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,799
I got to Humble for

225
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,680
college you leave it to California to

226
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,759
leave that impression right now I also

227
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,958
had some of the [ __ ] best pot

228
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:30,159
I'd ever smoked in my life in Humble but

229
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,759
I've never had bad weed last did did a

230
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,399
lot of Mexican brick weed make it up to

231
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,759
Alaska

232
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,320
too wow I didn't experience that till I

233
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,319
moved

234
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,839
to I might have seen some in

235
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,559
Humble when I moved to New Mexico was my

236
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,720
first real experience with Mexican brick

237
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,199
week so that's not even that long ago

238
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,399
right take back i' got

239
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,879
someone when we were I used to spend the

240
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:04,240
summers in California yeah um my parents

241
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:07,958
were from Humble and one of

242
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:12,120
their my paternal grandparents moved

243
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:14,278
from McKinleyville to uh s to the Bay

244
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,000
Area because he worked

245
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,320
for uh so I used to score weed with my

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,159
friend Matt in San Francisco and yeah I

247
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,959
remember getting brick weed then too so

248
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,719
in my teens were your parents Growers or

249
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:29,399
were they into that scene at all smoking

250
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,240
at least well my dad uh smoked whenever

251
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:36,399
his friends came over or he went over

252
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,360
there or they were working or there's a

253
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,039
lot of party in in Alaska you know

254
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,278
there's yeah imagine so yeah uh and they

255
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,799
also take work very serious because a

256
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,679
lot of the work you can only get done

257
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:50,399
during the summer so the

258
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:56,078
Summers uh with all of our parents were

259
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,078
a matter of working 16 to 18 hours a

260
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:04,800
day when you snatched a few joints from

261
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:08,120
their stash yeah right you know

262
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,000
yeah so you got a thousand what question

263
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,278
do you want to get

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,039
in I was actually more curious about um

265
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,399
what life was like for you back then and

266
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:22,679
like how you you know how you gravitated

267
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:27,198
towards the plant and all of

268
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:29,879
that um well it was uh I'll tell you

269
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,198
what really got me into weed the first

270
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,399
the first stuff I got into I think my

271
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,759
first

272
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:41,839
true love in the drug category was

273
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:46,159
probably LSD I loved acid as far back as

274
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,440
you know I I tripped the first I started

275
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,480
I don't know fifth grade sixth

276
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,680
grade you know by sixth grade I'd had

277
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,720
enough trip what I was doing and I also

278
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,719
grow grew up in an environment where

279
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,120
where we didn't have TV we didn't have

280
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,440
electricity for for a lot lot of it so I

281
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,959
read a lot and my dad had a lot of

282
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:13,199
counterculture books so I

283
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:16,159
really got into everything from the who

284
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:18,838
were the whacked out hippies on the bus

285
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,519
that began the whole hippie movement to

286
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,639
the Grateful Dead to marry pranksters

287
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,240
the you know and so there was a lot of

288
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,000
mention of

289
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:33,959
cannibis but for the most part I viewed

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,360
p as something to come down off of LSD

291
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:40,759
or mushrooms yeah

292
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:44,440
or or all those all that speed we had in

293
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:46,639
the 80s black beauties you know yeah

294
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,800
right whatever we used to get through

295
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,600
the school day um and that's what it was

296
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:56,198
for uh it didn't really become something

297
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
I was really passionate about until I

298
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,039
was

299
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,360
in either sophomore years or junior year

300
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,919
of high

301
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,480
school I was assigned to write a story

302
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:11,759
uh about the war on drugs and because

303
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,399
remember this mid 80s

304
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,759
yeah couldn't escape the War on Drugs

305
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
propaganda and I got I got assigned to

306
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,039
write a paper I don't know if it was

307
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,759
journalism or if it was just some sort

308
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:27,319
of writing class on the War on Drugs

309
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,680
specifically cus yeah and what I used to

310
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,040
do for my schoolwork is in the Library

311
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,719
we had these they were like

312
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,198
encyclopedias I think they were called

313
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,480
the S issues

314
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:43,639
SS

315
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,680
okay something along those lines and

316
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,120
basically what is they would address a

317
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,120
subject and they would present procon

318
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,679
proside and a conside and they would

319
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,639
back up each side with all the evidence

320
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,039
that they could find while they were

321
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,198
assembling the

322
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,919
encyclopedia and uh so I went and I

323
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:07,838
started reading you know you start with

324
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:12,000
the discovery of Delta tc9 whatever it

325
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,959
is yeah in Israel at a university and

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
then I read all the the Prides and then

327
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:20,239
I read the the consite for legalization

328
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,120
of

329
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,079
cannabis and

330
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,639
uh that's why I learned about the DEA

331
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,559
schedule you know schedule one through

332
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,600
four

333
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:38,439
and within 20 minutes within a half an

334
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:42,680
hour a 15-year-old kid in the mid

335
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:47,560
80s you know no internet no outside

336
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:51,638
interviews just two books figured out

337
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:54,958
that cannabis being illegal was was

338
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,440
[ __ ] yeah to be a schedule one

339
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,719
narcotic you must have no medicinal uses

340
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,519
well the guy who discovered

341
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,399
and labeled Delta 9

342
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:11,240
THC also noted like the first experiment

343
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:13,440
he did was on uh what was cataracts yeah

344
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,480
glaucoma or something like that yeah

345
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,519
swelling of the optic nerve and how

346
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,519
cannabis had the medicinal effect yeah

347
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,639
of shrinker back down not to mention all

348
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,000
the Bro Science from all the hippies

349
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:30,399
that you know were still in their 30s at

350
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,078
the time yeah and it was really shocking

351
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,480
to me that was my first real moment of

352
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:42,120
wow the government is pulling one over

353
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:44,959
on us and that led to you know the the

354
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,919
industry behind the War on Drugs you

355
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:51,078
know in hindsight it's tough to remember

356
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:54,360
when I discovered what phase of the the

357
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:57,318
industry of the war on Canabis and who

358
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,440
was making money off of it and where and

359
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:04,399
how much privatized you know prison

360
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,720
industry and on and on and on but as

361
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
hard as it is now in hindsight to

362
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,919
remember the exact timeline of

363
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,679
discovering those things I'll never

364
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,038
forget that day in the library when I

365
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,759
was 14 or 15 going wait a minute this

366
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:23,199
does not add up and at that point that's

367
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:28,078
when you know a a cannbis activist was

368
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:31,080
born in me yeah no makes sense it always

369
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:34,079
been something that you know our parents

370
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,879
and our parents friends and our teachers

371
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,558
and our future teachers and that was

372
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,919
something for them that was old man [ __ ]

373
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:47,678
give me a couple squares of acid a 40 of

374
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:51,080
malt liquor right Reds and a joint for

375
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:56,159
tomorrow morning and I was good you know

376
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:59,558
yeah I had you know I feel to stories

377
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,880
down I mean I tend to ramble especially

378
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,759
when I'm this side oh no that's good no

379
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,080
that's that I had a similar experience

380
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,480
uh growing up like weed was always

381
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,359
around but it was always like it wasn't

382
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,960
a drug to us like we were into drugs and

383
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,558
that was like okay yeah we'll smoke weed

384
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,759
but it was to you know come down off

385
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,359
this or in the meantime of getting this

386
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,798
or that it was always just kind of there

387
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,879
and it took a long time for me to find

388
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:26,558
the same passion that I have now similar

389
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,360
to your story yeah I probably a lot of

390
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:33,200
people you know probably came into now

391
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,240
once that happened and once I got a

392
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,919
little older and started meeting the

393
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:43,079
actual Growers instead of their

394
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,559
kids you know and talking about cannabis

395
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,199
while we sat around smoking it got more

396
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:50,158
interesting and more interesting and

397
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,798
then

398
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:57,200
as I was introduced to more

399
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,400
strings uh that that really peaked me

400
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,640
but even when I started in the mid 90s

401
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,480
when I started growing just full on

402
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,280
fulltime it we had one strength and that

403
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,079
was blueberry that was it we didn't give

404
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,319
it to

405
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:13,399
anybody you know uh our closest friends

406
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:14,839
the first couple years had no idea we

407
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,240
were the ones who were growing the

408
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,240
Skiller weed

409
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,599
yeah it was so blue I Matt I know you're

410
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,719
a strin nut it this is how blue old blue

411
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:32,000
is

412
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,679
from from from Delta uh a lot of people

413
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,599
would travel together during the winter

414
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,519
a lot of us would work up their seasonal

415
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,759
you know

416
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,319
firefighting working out in the woods

417
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,599
with geologists exploratory geologists

418
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:45,359
looking Gold Mine [ __ ] like that and

419
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,678
then go wherever we wanted in the winter

420
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,199
some of them

421
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:55,559
go snowboarding you know in Utah or

422
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,600
wherever um and so this one winter three

423
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,839
people from Delta came with me down to

424
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,038
Portland to where I had my established

425
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,279
circle of

426
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,879
friends and one of them was the guy who

427
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,480
gave me the blueberry cut his stepdad

428
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,720
was the guy who gave me the blueberry

429
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,038
cut so Bill knew that I had spent the

430
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,319
previous winter growing blueberry in

431
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,400
Portland went back home worked Billy

432
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,960
came with

433
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:25,360
us uh and and my partners already had

434
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,480
the blueberry going when we got back so

435
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,879
the first thing we did when I got there

436
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,360
uh we had to fix the ventilation on the

437
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,840
roof and I said Bill come on up with me

438
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,599
I just got to fix the ventilation for

439
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,399
the grow room yeah and we go we we

440
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,719
smoked a joint of

441
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,798
blueberry climbed up the ladder went

442
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,120
started fixing the ventilation from our

443
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,519
flower chamber and Billy looks around

444
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:51,519
and goes oo one of your neighbors is

445
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,519
baking blueberry

446
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,760
muffins how high are you you know yeah

447
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,880
it was crazy it it's I've seen so many

448
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,640
Blues

449
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,960
DJs you know I've seen so many Blues

450
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,600
from men and none of them are close to

451
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,798
what that blue very was which is what

452
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:16,558
old dude says about every old strain you

453
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:18,639
know yeah but absolutely true nothing

454
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,000
people every place that clone has been

455
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,320
people still tell stories about

456
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,440
that there is a clone that floated

457
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,879
around uh Oregon as well I don't I don't

458
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,159
I it's old and it's also called old blue

459
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,360
and it's also maybe not connected to DJ

460
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,640
Short as

461
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:40,798
well you know it could be it could be

462
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,679
things did not end well in Portland for

463
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,440
a group of us because there was other

464
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,960
drugs still involved back

465
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,240
sure um and it's

466
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,200
possible the one guy besides me who had

467
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,798
access to it could have Let It Go I mean

468
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,960
yeah to this day he's still on the

469
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,400
needle so he

470
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,000
hasn't so I got to judge his

471
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,278
trustworthiness yeah for sure you know

472
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,200
so I don't know it it's very possible

473
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:16,960
but uh there was there was a couple

474
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,640
blueberries in Oregon at the same time

475
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,278
yeah that makes sense bunch of

476
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,360
hippies yeah and I had no idea if it

477
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:25,480
would survived or not until this past

478
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,798
year

479
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,839
when uh my sister got a hold of my

480
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,558
childhood best

481
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:36,759
friend his mother on Facebook and they

482
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:39,359
put the two of us in touch and uh I sent

483
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:42,480
him a picture in my flower room and he

484
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,038
immediately sent back a picture of his

485
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,679
uh and it was just Captain old blue and

486

489
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,599
see it I want to see it that was my

490
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,519
immediate plan um right now I'm [ __ ]

I've got it in works right now I I got

498

501
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:33,519
nightmarishly hot nothing lives in mail

502
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:36,519

503
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:40,038
to him we we he said he's willing to to

504
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:44,079
send it down so we'll see I I had some

505
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:46,960
hesitancy at first it's like

506
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:50,158
uh you know sometimes what's Hall of

507
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,840
Fame in your mind yeah is exagerated

508
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,520
over the years and I'm old enough to

509
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,439
know that sometimes just leave that

510
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,558
alone yeah but then your show last year

511
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,000
when that when that viewer from from

512
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,960
North Pole started typing in blueberries

513
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,200
I was like [ __ ] if if my hometown is

514
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,880
still known for blueberry pot then yeah

515
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,679
I'm pretty sure it'll hold up just fine

516
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,720
yeah that's pretty cool that's pretty

517
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,519
cool I I I love all blueberries even

518
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,919
though I feel like I've got the best I

519
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,639
still want all of them I need to

520
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:21,880
experience all of them when I hear about

521
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,360
especially the older ones it may not

522
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,360
even be related or tangentially related

523
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,879
or whatever the DJ's lines you know I'll

524
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,278
say this about DJ J's lines every blue

525
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:37,679
smell I ever smelled from them wasn't

526
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:40,038
really blue now that's not a giant pool

527
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,798
of DJ shorts blueberry that I'm drawing

528
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,798
from that's sure I don't know how many

529
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,798
samples from how many Growers I grew his

530
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:52,720
stuff once it was actually a cross it

531
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:56,240
was uh it was Dr Atomic from Canada yeah

532
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,759
yeah DJ shorts blue and somebody's

533
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,319
probably sense's nl5 y it actually was

534
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:08,158
not a bad

535
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:10,200
cross I remember those pretty fondly

536
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,399
actually there were some good blues that

537
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,360
circulated Canada there really were um

538
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:16,599
different selections done with DJ stuff

539
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,319
bigger selections done in Canada by

540
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,599
different dudes up there and and they

541
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,200
did pull out some really good Blues but

542
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:23,798
they were they were few and far between

543
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,519
and hard to get down

544
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:31,558
here they uh they were they always

545
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:34,720
seemed more fond of the the fruit tping

546
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:36,798
in Canada you know even before the

547
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,919
forums you could tell the Canadian seed

548
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:43,079
companies they were all selling berries

549
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:46,440
of various types

550
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,199

up on the Forum so early

556
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:06,798

with that it was it was on that computer

560

561
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:19,398
on a computer they'd been out but I just

562
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:22,918
I I was busy you

563
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:25,479
know uh I started looking for pot and

564
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:29,159
the first two things I found

565
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:32,000
were who was who was it who had herana

566
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:36,039
back in the day motor Rebel and um wood

567
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,599
horse and yeah wood I found that was

568
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,158
like the first pot anything on the

569
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:44,319
internet I ever found I'm like holy [ __ ]

570
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:47,320

571
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:50,359
overgrown right after that yeah so what

572
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:54,278
was your experience like there I

573
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:56,798
never there was a point where I did

574
00:26:54,278 --> 00:27:01,240
register there was I I was super

575
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:03,519
paranoid still back then sure

576
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,359
um there was a time period when you

577
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,759
didn't have to be registered to view

578
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,719
everything on overgrow and at some point

579
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:14,038
they made an upgrade where it was only

580
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:17,519
limited access so people all registered

581
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:20,519
as like unregistered

582
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,720
1701 I was one of those unregistered

583
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,359
guys for a

584
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,159
little

585
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:30,158
um but uh then

586
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
around

587
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:37,440
when did I sign up at IC

588
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,480
mag when did IC mag start that was in

589
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,080
the 2000 right

590
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,399
2007

591
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:50,359
2006 I think it started in 200 2002 or

592
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:52,678
2003 even earlier yeah I registered in

593
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:56,479
2006

594
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:59,360
okay something like that and that was

595
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,798
that was the coolest cannabis experience

596
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:06,479
I ever had outside of the actual growing

597
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,720
and smoking yeah for sure but that was

598
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,960
you know High Times may be a joke now

599
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,240
the fact that High Times was pretty much

600
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,319
my only source of information sure any

601
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,240
for a decade and a half [ __ ] I mean I

602
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,839
think you look back some of those old

603
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,679
High Times you know that

604
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:28,959
magazine was not only respectable as far

605
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,679
as I'm concerned they had hulix are

606
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,000
worthy content back then that would have

607
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,159
never been considered oh yeah but when

608
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,278
the qualifications for what it takes to

609
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,159
you know to qualify for awards like that

610
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,200
they had it they had it all I agree

611
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,679
early High Times was amazing some of the

612
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,480
best even some of the best strain

613
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,759
reviews you could ever find you know

614
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,480
back from are The Connoisseur they had

615
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,798
cool punk rock stuff too like they were

616
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,759
very punk rock oriented in the 70s which

617
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:02,639
I thought was interesting

618
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,240
and metal and metal yeah yeah it wasn't

619
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,278

00:30:52,038 --> 00:31:00,679
California I understood exactly where

660
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:03,960
somebody with 25 or 30 flowering plants

661
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,880
ranked on the list of [ __ ] that the

662
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:10,880
local or feds needed to get done and get

663
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,559
busted yeah point in the early 2000s in

664
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,919
California if you were going growing 25

665
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,480
plants nobody gave a [ __ ] exactly that's

666
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,159
how I felt

667
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,480
too so at that point my paranoia almost

668
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,679
completely

669
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,919
disappeared so when does when does the

670
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,559
sub Rob's Madness cut the San Diego

671
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:36,600
Madness cut float through what year is

672
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:40,079
that I started getting that in 1999 it

673
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:43,439
wasn't a big San Diego cut one guy had

674
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:46,519
it one grower that was it and he also

675
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,639
bred it it was

676
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,880
uh it was Oregon big bud crossed with an

677
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:54,839
indicia that he

678
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:59,320
had uh I started getting it from this

679
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:00,839
kid his his girlfriend worked with mine

680
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:04,720
and uh he came

681
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:06,720
over and started selling me that he also

682
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,278
got bull rider

683
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,960
p91 Betsy Hog's Breath he got every C

684
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:18,079
every strain that came through San Diego

685
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:22,880
this 16 or 17 year old kid had access to

686
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:24,879
awesome family um I never found out who

687
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,440
it was I never cared you know I wasn't

688
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,399
trying to get a better deal just make

689
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,440
sure I don't run out of weed

690
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,518
um and then I started growing again and

691
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,360
this kid would always ask me about

692
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:39,798
cannabis he he was always interested in

693
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,719
cannabis and cannabis history so when

694
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:44,638
the guy who was selling him Madness

695
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,839
decided to retire and moved back to

696
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:50,240
Humble he said I ain't taking this clone

697
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,480
with me he was he was old he I guess he

698
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,759
was

699
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,599
like and uh he told he told my friend

700
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:59,240

701
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,319

702
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,519
and he said I got just the guy and so he

703
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:07,200
gave it to me um and that's still one of

704
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,558
my favorite Cuts not the most potent

705
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,919
yeah it was it wasn't going to knock any

706
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:14,599
of

707
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,240
the the really well-known San Diego

708
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:19,959
Cuts you know off the top of the

709
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,200
mountain except for in you I've never

710
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,759
had a never had a cut like that what was

711
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,278
the CH profile like on it like the scent

712
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:33,440
profile it was

713
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:36,359
uh leathery it was it was in that

714
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,320
leathery you know kind of

715
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,359
suede new suede new leather you know

716
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,000
that

717
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:45,199
smell

718
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,319
sweetness very hard to describe very

719
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,278
hard but uh it was definitely

720
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:56,720
unique um tasted just like it smelled

721
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:59,440
and it had a good solid good solid High

722
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,600
yeah interesting do you have any idea

723
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,278
what it might have been cross to like

724
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,278
with all your years of experience now

725
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,519
looking back wouldn't have a guess I've

726
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:11,039
had

727
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,759
other I've had other strains that that

728
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,398
fit into that

729
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,399
leathery

730
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:22,199
pleather tennis ball suede yeah I think

731
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:27,159
uh the perfect Pearl cross that you sent

732
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:30,759
me oh yeah yeah that a little bit uh but

733
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:34,919
it's not a profile that that you see a

734
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,040
lot you know definitely not nowadays it

735
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,799
had like a like an aftertaste too which

736
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,440
is always good with the cannabis strain

737
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:46,679
it had the not the taste but you know

738
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,960
how Shram immediately evokes nag Champa

739
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,878
oh yeah nag Champa this

740
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,800
invoked the texture of cologne to me

741
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,239
interesting he

742
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,960
necessarily not not NE

743
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,559
a specific scent but just the after

744
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,000
effects

745
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,559
of

746
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,119

great when did you first run into let's

749
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,319
let's go through a little list uh p91

750
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:21,920
your

751
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:26,000
experience well I moved to San Diego

752
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:29,400
moved permanently to San Diego in 99

753
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,800
okay so it was everywhere yeah it was

754
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,960
everywhere I happened to stumble into I

755
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,480
should say most of my friends in San

756
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,240
Diego that I had made prior to moving

757
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,400
there permanently weren't weren't really

758
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,039
smokers they were all

759
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,160
drink

760
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:50,039
um but it it isn't hard if you're out

761
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:53,519
drinking to meet

762
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:56,639
somebody in Ocean

763
00:35:53,519 --> 00:36:00,159
Beach and once they get you a sack of

764
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,679
p91 you don't lose that number you know

765
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,598
right no the

766
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:08,399
relationship

767
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,400
yeah so how about Hog's

768
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:16,160
Breath same thing man I I got that

769
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:20,199
kid that kid who basically became my pot

770
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:23,318
dealer uh he he had access to everything

771
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:27,078
pretty much as soon as I met him that

772
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:31,159
was let's see that was Jennifer so uh

773
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:33,119
yeah so like 2000 yeah you know I mean

774
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:35,920
he just started bring every week he'd

775
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,920
bring me a

776
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,760
selection and

777
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:46,159
then you know we didn't not everybody

778
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,040
had the frame of reference of strain

779
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,759
names back then sure so it wasn't you

780
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,559
know your dealer didn't show up say oh I

781
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,480
got

782
00:36:52,559 --> 00:37:00,960
p91 he showed up killer green Bud right

783
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,519
here and I think 91 you know um so I

784
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,800
don't know which was first but I

785
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,960
remember they all came from that one guy

786
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,560
and and he was only dealing for a couple

787
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,800
years once I met him before he moved on

788
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:15,920
to more lucrative things yeah so yeah so

789
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,200
I think that my experience with all

790
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,760
those San Diego streams pretty much

791
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:23,078
started almost immediately that's pretty

792
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,040
cool so I know I know we've moved on

793
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:28,119
from the p91 but I didn't want to ask

794
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:31,519
cuz it's it's a name and it's a cut that

795
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,358
still floats around in the group um and

796
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,199
I like to know like your impressions of

797
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:39,000
it from back then you know how would you

798
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,358
have described it well it's the S1

799
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,199
that's still floating around just the S1

800
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:48,358
yeah sorry that's it yeah yeah

801
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:51,239
um well you know it was I did a small

802
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:52,838
experiment I I I don't remember when I

803
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:57,719
got the

804
00:37:52,838 --> 00:38:02,480
cut had to be probably I don't know 200

805
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:06,159
three or so yeah I got the cut and I

806
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:12,119
noticed something a specific effect that

807
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:15,519
I got when when I smoked it so what I

808
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,838
did was I had a few guys that I shared

809
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:21,400
with that I hooked up and two or three

810
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:25,519
in particular who did not know each

811
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,440
other you know I I gave them each a sack

812
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,679
yeah and them for feedback

813
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,119
I'm like anything specific no matter how

814
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:35,919
weird or how corny or how important

815
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,119
unimportant you might think it is I just

816
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,240
want to hear it and again they were

817
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,079
separate and all three of them came back

818
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,919
to me with the same exact thing that I

819
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,720
had noticed and that was when I smoked

820
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:52,519
p91 I slept better than any other time

821
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,598
in my life and I had the most intense

822
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:57,880
dreams when

823
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,599
interesting and I and I hadn't even so

824
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,880
much as hinted to any of the actually I

825
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:07,640
think it was two guys

826
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,720
uh I I never said a word about it it was

827
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:13,679
what do they call it a blind test

828
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:16,639
yeah they both back and the only thing

829
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,358
they had to say about it was the Sleep

830
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:21,358
effects the dream

831
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:22,719
effects and uh as far as other thoughts

832
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,838
so that's the first thing that always

833
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:29,959
comes to mind when I pick p91 yeah B to

834
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:33,960
me I remember the taste I remember the

835
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,599
feel of the flowers everything the term

836
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,599
Oily to me

837
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:43,000
yeah very oily now that's not always a

838
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:45,280
good you know that's not always a good

839
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,079
quality whether it be from a hash making

840
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,800
perspective to sometimes the strains

841
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,800
I've tried that were oily on the flowers

842
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,960
like that weren't that great or were

843
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:02,240
more CBD than they were THC sure but

844
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,800
91's case n it was everything was good

845
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:09,199
I've heard uh peanut oil or just

846
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,960
straight Associated yeah with with to

847
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:15,358
but uh I'd say oily

848
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,400
and good bed time meds man yeah it's

849
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:18,960
strong [ __ ] even the S1 kept that that

850
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,318
potency where like people compare it to

851
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,960
kimd type potency stuff like that I'm a

852
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:31,880
big fan of s1s and that that p91 S1 that

853
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:35,400
who is is it B has it bit Yeah insane

854
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,240
when he posts it or anybody who's dra

855
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,760
it yeah that's a sick

856
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,679
one yeah that's

857
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,319
cool I was gonna ask if yeah exactly

858
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,639
whether you whether you'd um actually

859
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,960
gotten to try the the S1 that floats

860
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,598
around or if it's just something that

861
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,679
you've seen from a distance I haven't

862
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,440
yet I think that kind of popped up in

863
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:59,078
San Diego after I'd already left I've

864
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,559
been out here a few years

865
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,920
yeah were you were you one of the people

866
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,358
I think no I think it was grotch and

867
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,318
someone else when someone claimed to

868
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:07,719
have the original p91 and had a bunch of

869
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,440
people show up to a collective and they

870
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:13,480
were like sorry bro sorry bro and he got

871
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,559
all mad at everyone that wasn't grotch I

872
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,800
don't think that was grotch might have

873
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,599
been someone else some well some it

874
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,160
wasn't grotch that popped up with a cut

875
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,800
grotch was one of the people I think

876
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:26,199
that went bitter went a few other people

877
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,839
I had to inform the dude he didn't have

878
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:30,679
what he thought he had

879
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:33,480
so you're talking relatively recent yeah

880
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:33,480
yeah in the past few

881
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:40,960
years I think that must have

882
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,359
happened again after after I left so

883
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,079
about two or three years two or three

884
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:47,880
years ago yeah yeah I I'm still in touch

885
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,400
with all those guys were on group

886
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,720
threads and stuff like that but I don't

887
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,039
I don't really know anything about that

888
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,879
let's talk about how you met some of

889
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:57,759
those dudes on on uh sano's finest Cuts

890
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,400
Like that's

891
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,800
probably when I think of like the most

892
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,680
uh seminal influential uh threads

893
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,039
throughout all Vice mag that of course

894
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,159
that one jumps out to me because I was

895
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,800
in San Diego for a long time and and I

896
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,440
was kind of partial to that and some of

897
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,960
the guys but for you like how did you

898
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:22,240
all kind of form into a a crew of

899
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,358
Swords uh yeah it uh it started with uh

900
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:28,399

924
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,400

2004 or or no May no probably a little

942
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:42,119
later than that because we were already

943
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:45,079
on icy M so let's call it 06

944
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,358
yeah you know I was still popping seeds

945
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,119
in San Diego and growing until I got the

946
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:52,679
madness cut uh and then I met ape and

947
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,200
hit the bullet and said [ __ ] it I'm

948
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:57,399
going to trust this dude I'm GNA buy

949
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,439
cuts from somebody I'm not Rel related

950
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,760
to

951
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:08,318
yeah and I was blown away I mean I had I

952
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:12,400
had a at the time 4x4 flower tent and I

953
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:16,599
had probably 35 moms you know yeah yeah

954
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,920
I know what you mean one cut Rob to 35

955
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,920
cut

956
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,160
Rob so yes that's how it started and

957
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:25,960
then once you're sharing information

958
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:30,039
like that

959
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,440
anonymously you know you just start

960
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:35,119
going to the get togethers at robs watch

961
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,119
the fights and let me tell you everybody

962
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,640
was always trying to outdo everybody in

963
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,960
the early times we'd have the get

964
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:42,440
togethers and even Gypsy warned us

965
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,599
because we talked about it he's like hey

966
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,679
man have your G togethers but you got to

967
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,960
be careful you know law enforcement is

968
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:55,000
probably you know looking at the [ __ ]

969
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,800
that leftover paranoia from anybody over

970
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,599
30 at the time and we're like prop 15

971
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:06,318
prop 215 go [ __ ] yourself we suck it

972
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:08,240
we're done with that [ __ ] yeah and uh

973
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,960
and that's how that's how it started man

974
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,919
and and so everybody would come over to

975
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,960
my

976
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,318
house and everybody would bring like an

977
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,720
ounce of

978
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:21,279
flour big chunks of hash bubble hash you

979
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,879
know

980
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,559
Edibles and everybody would leave after

981
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,318
like four hours and I would stumble down

982
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,599
into my kitchen the next morning and on

983
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:35,800
the dining room table is like you know

984
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,800
five grand worth of

985

weed edibles I'm like what the [ __ ] and

986
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,400
it happened every time and the group was

987
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:50,239
slowly growing and I would tell people

988
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,519
hey if you see it on this table take it

989

on your way out you know don't be a lot

990

of weed but everybody was still polite

991
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,559
and getting to know each other so I

992
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,079
ended up with so much more than I could

993
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,400

994
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:08,559

1022
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,400
honesty and

1023
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,119
criticism and that's one of the

1024
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:39,559
things you know yeah but we all at least

1025
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,838
I learned I learned so much from being

1026
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,359
on that thre you know what's funny is I

1027
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,558
didn't really realize how how

1028
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,519
influential ape was in the in the threat

1029
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,480
I knew he was you know a part of it I

1030
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,599
didn't realize how influential he was in

1031
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,760
that group because it's funny because

1032
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:55,200
like he had he was influential on me as

1033
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,640
well like he really really hooked me up

1034
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:00,919
early on with clones that you know like

1035
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:02,838
I I didn't understand how how deep of

1036
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,920
access I was given immediately as I got

1037
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:06,318
into San Diego and it was just

1038
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,119
drastically different than any other

1039
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,960
City I've been to like that it was just

1040
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:15,039
like Bam Bam everything's legit from the

1041
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:18,358

00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:42,240
where I ended up in SoCal in the early

1051
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:46,160

Wick Wick 650 yeah Wick 650 he was a

1062
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:22,399
part of C Cali Connection 2o I think or

1063
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:25,479
he was involved with getting sort of his

1064
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,318
early Cuts yeah yeah and those guys were

1065
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:31,199
all involved with each other at some

1066
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:34,159
point I mean it's just like uh just like

1067
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,639
us splitting up you know flowering

1068
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,639
duties for new clones amongst the San

1069
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,798
Diego finest guys I'm sure those guys

1070
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:44,879
were like hey man if you'll take OG you

1071
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:50,960
know over to San Bernardino for me I'll

1072
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:54,838
drop GDP off in the bay for you you know

1073
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,199
I'm so I just looked at the thread in it

1074
00:50:54,838 --> 00:51:00,199
the first one is 2008

1075
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:02,639
um I also thought

1076
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:06,879
that I could ask you about some of the

1077
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:08,719
other cuts that were around um sour

1078
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,920
dub sour

1079
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,838
du my favorite plants of all time yeah

1080
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,119
it's a damn good cut

1081
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,000
dude matter of fact I've got it coming

1082
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:20,920
back with the OG that I've got coming

1083
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,880
I've got uh

1084
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:27,280
got OG I've got you know what I don't

1085
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,440
even give a [ __ ]

1086
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,559
what what label comes with an OG but

1087
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:38,798
anyway I I'm wandering off your path

1088
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:40,359
again thousand so sour double yes uh The

1089
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:45,039
Taste

1090
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:49,679
incredible uh one very fast plant to

1091
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:52,480
grow only plant that I take early like I

1092
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:54,440
take everything till it's done I let it

1093
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,119
finish it's

1094
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:01,200
rare doesn't go 70 days

1095
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:03,960
and sour double is not done at 62 63

1096
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,759
days but that's as far as I take her

1097
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,760
because the the the tpping start going

1098
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,760
like this like

1099
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,160
yeah still great when you take 70 when

1100
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,599
it's finished but you don't get any

1101
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:20,199
higher the depth the high doesn't change

1102
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,079
anything in two weeks like the last two

1103
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:26,960
weeks or it's a great breeding stream me

1104
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,559
yeah remind me what it lineage is guys

1105
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,599
who was Sour dub sour dub was a uh sour

1106
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:36,079
bubble from bog cross to and there's

1107
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:37,680
some debate um on whether it was nycd I

1108
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,798
don't think it was nycd because it has a

1109
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,558
lot of sour diesel type notes in it so

1110
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:46,079
I'm pretty sure it was res doog Sour

1111
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:50,319
Diesel I pretty sure that's why there's

1112
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:53,519
confusion because res rat had them both

1113
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:56,039
yes that's right and I'll tell you I've

1114
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:59,079
gone back and forth and so is gry school

1115
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:01,719
and so is Sean Kon so is everybody who's

1116
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:05,960
been growing her you know on and off

1117
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:08,838
since she came to be yeah

1118
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,920
U you know there are times when you

1119
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:16,960
really got her dialed in that

1120
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:19,000
a that a sour grapefruit like red

1121
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,920
grapefruit

1122
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,519
smell is in there yeah and grown nycd

1123
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,240
that's one of the things she was known

1124
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:33,519
for was red grapefruit and I've smelled

1125
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,318
it but on the other hand the sour that

1126
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:38,639
you smell is so

1127
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:40,759
traditionally and and I heard there's no

1128
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:44,838
sour diesel in

1129
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:48,760
nycd there's not no so there's not but

1130
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:52,239
in sour double there is a

1131
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:55,400
sour no doubt about it that goes back

1132
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,959
to to being from that original Sour

1133
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,039
Diesel Jee pool

1134
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,559
I agree yeah I mean I've got it to go

1135
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,960
super skunky um I don't really hear

1136
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,760
people talk about that much with it but

1137
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,400
I've got it to go super super skunky to

1138
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,079
where it was just like right in that

1139
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,240
skunky Zone with sour and that you know

1140
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:15,200
sour dub it was gnarly it was

1141
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:17,519
gnarly yeah sour dub is is a great plant

1142
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:21,759
the official story there there lots of

1143
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:25,239
variations out there the story is bog

1144
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:29,880
gave a handful of seeds at a NorCal

1145

1150
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:51,680
you've ever smoked the dude grew it it

1151
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:55,519
became a staple of that crew uh our our

1152
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:57,118
boy grce skull knew one of the guys in

1153
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:59,280
that crew

1154
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,880
and he gave it to gry skull and saide

1155
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,680
man you got to change the

1156
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,760
name uh nobody can know that you have

1157
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:10,558
this plant

1158
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:14,000
yeah like hash plant but cash because

1159
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,040
they were just serious money off this

1160
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,079
plant uh

1161
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:23,318
so gr school gave it to a couple of us

1162
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:26,079
in you know

1163
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:28,119
Circle uh whoever wasn't full at the

1164
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:31,400
time of of all the strains they could

1165
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:33,440
handle and we started growing it and by

1166
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,960
the first harvest everybody was making

1167
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,760
room for it everybody made room for sour

1168
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,318
double in there we said we got to come

1169
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,880
up with the name if we're going to you

1170
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:44,639
know talk about this online because

1171
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:48,119
that's the one stipulation that that

1172
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:52,400
gray has to to stick with is not to call

1173
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:54,318
it cash plan yeah so at one point Bob

1174
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:59,119
was consulted and he said I'd just call

1175
00:55:54,318 --> 00:56:01,199
it double salad and uh I was like that's

1176
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,880
good enough for me grce skull said

1177
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,639
that's good enough for me and then one

1178
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,519
of the younger dudes who was always

1179
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:10,679
thinking you know he he was he was

1180
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:12,920
probably 15 years my junior and he he

1181
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,279
kind of knew what was coming up with

1182
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:19,000
social media hadn't really started yet

1183
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,079
but yeah the younger you know let's put

1184
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,400
something more marketable than double

1185
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:27,680
sour and he suggested sour

1186
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,599
double instead of double sour because

1187
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,879
the S came before the D and he said

1188
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:36,000
it'll always be associated with San

1189
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,480
Diego now oh that's smart and we all

1190
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,199
took a vote and sour double won so

1191
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,559
that's why it's called sour

1192
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:44,038
double yeah that wasn't you know I

1193
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,640
remember when I first got the cut I

1194
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:46,920
dropped it immediately without flying

1195
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:48,078
because I was like oh this sounds boring

1196
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,159
it would just be like another sour

1197
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,079
bubble you know I really regretted that

1198
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,118
cuz I could have had it much earlier on

1199
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,880
you know and ran through with it yeah

1200
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:01,640
that was uh that's crazy weed I mean I

1201
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,599
still grow it yeah I'm oh dude wait till

1202
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:06,838
pop some of those skank dogs we'll get

1203
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,680
into that later yeah yeah yeah let's

1204
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,519
into it now yeah these the crosses that

1205
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:16,480
you just

1206
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:18,599
released um it was I I got double

1207
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,679
specifically uh because I wanted to

1208
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:23,680
reverse it specifically I wanted to

1209
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:29,440
cross SSH and sour double yeah ever

1210
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:32,000
since heard about SS s eh yeah yeah back

1211
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:37,480
forms I just thought that would be a

1212
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:41,960
great merging of of tpping of smells of

1213
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:44,760
taste uh so I got the SSH back I got

1214
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,639
this the double back from Gray let's

1215
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,680
talk real quick let me cut you off let's

1216
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:50,639
talk about the

1217
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:54,038
SSH the history behind it real

1218
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:59,358
quick y uh it's pretty commonly referred

1219
00:57:54,039 --> 00:58:02,599
to as 98 SSH now yeah I think crazy is

1220
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:06,279
calling another one 97 I think SOG cut

1221
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:10,720
maybe oh yeah yeah Old sogs 97 yeah so

1222
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,720
when I'm talking about the SSH the

1223
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:15,838
98

1224
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:19,318
when that cut came to me and Sean from a

1225
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:21,798
guy in Camp okay when when he gave us

1226
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:25,199
the cut among other Cuts he told us it

1227
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:28,119
was the one that won the cup in 98 the

1228
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:28,118
High Times C

1229
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,240
so you know that we took that at every

1230
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:37,838
strain this guy gave us was exactly what

1231
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:38,719
it was the guy knew people so I thought

1232
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:42,798
there

1233
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:45,598
was that's what it was uh the first time

1234
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:48,038
I heard different was Noto pointing out

1235
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,880
when he every time he saw pictures of it

1236
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:54,640
and and heard it being harvested at day

1237
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,160
65 Day 70 at the latest and being done

1238
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:00,239
he's like you know that doesn't sense

1239
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:05,879
sound like the or look like the 1998 Cup

1240
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:08,239
winning cut of ss MH and from everything

1241
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,880
that he said and he sent some pictures I

1242
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:14,519
immediately stopped calling it The Cup

1243
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:16,640
winning cup yeah crazy I think more

1244
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:19,920
people know about that cut from crazy

1245
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:23,838
composer than anyone else because he a

1246
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,240
bunch of it yeah and uh he immediately

1247
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,798
you know after talking to Nato I noticed

1248
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:31,519
also started calling it The 98 and I I

1249
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:34,639
think that's kind of

1250
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:37,798
become the common monitor of that cut so

1251
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:40,199
that history we got it from

1252
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:42,358
Canada we were told it was shanti's

1253
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:46,598
personal cut I will say this about that

1254
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:50,880
cut I hit Shany up on Mr Nice

1255
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:53,519
fors said hey man I just got 98

1256
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,838
supposedly I just got the 98 Cup winning

1257
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:59,759
cut from a guy in Canada

1258
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:02,719
and Shanti hit me back immediately and

1259
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,799
saidwell did it come with a number and I

1260
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:09,159
said it did not he says if that CET is

1261
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:12,759
given out to anybody the person giving

1262
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:15,639
it to them must give them the number you

1263
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,640
know whatever the number was maybe it

1264
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:22,920
was Trey position when Shanti was

1265
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:26,960
growing last you is what it was but it

1266
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:29,480
did not come with the number so

1267
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,720
I uh I read the email and I said okay

1268
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,880
cool you know we'll see we'll see what

1269
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:37,480
it's like like 15 minutes later I got a

1270
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:41,000
call from the guy in Canada who said hey

1271
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:43,880
man I just got a call from Scott or yeah

1272
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:49,000
yeah Scott yeah I just got Scott that

1273
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:51,519
I'm handing out his cut um so the guy

1274
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,239
who gave it to me never retracted that

1275
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,639
it was the cup when cut but it it seems

1276
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:58,838
to me that there was a

1277
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:02,920
breaking the communication between

1278
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:04,719
Shanti and this sort yeah yeah maybe

1279
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,000
they just had them mixed up tell you

1280
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:10,519
this it's an excellent cut it is a

1281
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,280
everything that I used to read about

1282
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:19,119
super silver Hayes in Mark emer's Seed

1283
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:22,119
Catalog or S catalog it fits that

1284
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,640
description to it to you and it's fast

1285
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:27,358
and it's effortless it's just it grows

1286
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,239
itself just give it the bare minimum of

1287
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,598
what it needs and you're going to get a

1288
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:35,318
big gorgeous plant

1289
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:37,720
ssh what do you about scent

1290
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:40,639
profile what's that what's the scent

1291
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:42,279
profile on that one got the lemon you

1292
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,679
know it's got the lemon it's got that

1293
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:48,119
cedar Haze yeah to me those would be the

1294
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:49,960
three things I would describe but I've

1295
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:52,278
never been very good at descriptions

1296
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:57,159
I've always relied on the other guys in

1297
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:59,719
SDF for that uh but Cedar hay lemon I

1298
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:02,639
think is a pretty good summation yeah

1299
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:04,879
that sounds right I got tired of it I

1300
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,759
don't know if it's because I grew so

1301
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,519
much of it there before I left I mean

1302
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:12,920
you walk into a room full of that stuff

1303
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:18,639
and it's drowning out

1304
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:21,159
other yeah it's loud um it was either

1305
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:24,838
that or you know I smoked a lot of it

1306
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:28,159
and most of what me and my business

1307
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:31,599
partner were smoking at the time was Kim

1308
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:33,879
and OG yeah you know you got to be

1309
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:36,880
pretty stout to keep up with Kim and the

1310
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:41,318
ogs and it's and I've never been that

1311
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,960
much of a sativa guy but to me it a it

1312
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:46,239
definitely leans

1313
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,278
sativa but the true sativa heads will

1314
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,598
tell you it's too indicia you know it's

1315
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:53,798
short

1316
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:57,960
flowering pretty pretty thick flowers of

1317
01:02:53,798 --> 01:03:02,358
good yields um a nice

1318
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,960
ay a nice indusa mix yeah like a good

1319
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:07,440
like a good super silver hay should be

1320
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:10,400
you know know five skunk one Haze yeah

1321
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,599
so yeah so the way one of the ways we

1322
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,079
judged Bud was by how much we had to

1323
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:18,680
smoke to get through the Raiders game

1324
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,400
because the ra for a few seasons were

1325
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:24,078
pretty intolerable and we had to smoke a

1326
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:27,119
lot of SSH to get through some of those

1327
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,599
Raider games uh

1328
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,278
so we pretty

1329
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:35,798
much for the for the bleer of the years

1330
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:37,239
there that's funny so in summation

1331
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:40,679
that's that's the cut that you used in

1332
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:43,558
Cross to a reversed sour dub right

1333
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:44,598
revers sour dub your juice is the [ __ ]

1334
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:48,640
I'll say

1335
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:52,359
it I got I got I mean I'm still scraping

1336
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:52,358
pollen off the surfaces in

1337
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:59,719
there ironically that cross is not at

1338
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,079
all what I want I have found nothing

1339
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:06,078
that I was looking for in that

1340
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:09,640
cross but what I found was if you like

1341
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:14,278
super silver haze which seems everybody

1342
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:17,239
besides me and my buddy you know yeah

1343
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:20,559
Super Silver Haze then what you'll find

1344
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:23,159
is twoth thirds of the the plants will

1345
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,920
be super silver haze but a little bit

1346
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:28,960
fatter and a little bit more body in the

1347
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:32,119
stone yeah so it me it was an

1348
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,159
improvement but but the ones that I'm

1349
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:36,200
really interested in is the one out of

1350
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:37,920
three that

1351
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:42,239
is

1352
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:47,159
uh I what I describe it as the 90s seat

1353
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:50,519
catalog stock photo of hay hybrid yeah

1354
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:53,440
it longer flowering 80 to 90 days big

1355
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:56,199
leaves don't like small containers at

1356
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,519
all just put them in big on

1357
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:01,000
uh but the flowers that came from those

1358
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:03,719
things are pretty insane I smoked

1359
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,920
nothing but that feno of SSH for like

1360
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:08,480
four months yeah I

1361
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,760
bet find a

1362
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,358
special cut especially when you're not

1363
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:17,119
used to really good sativas which I'm

1364
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:20,159
not you know physiology or what but's

1365
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:23,400
different this thing blew my mind I

1366
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,159
really enjoyed it and when I pop more of

1367
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,920
those

1368
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:30,879
seeds I'll be looking for those

1369
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:34,318
fenos but the SSH fenos that came out of

1370
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:38,039
it are so freaking good the hash that I

1371
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:40,199
made the hash just balls off of it um

1372
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,079
and that's why I sent those ones in you

1373
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:44,759
know I

1374
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:47,720
haven't years but after a year year and

1375
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:50,799
a half the reports I've gotten back from

1376
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:52,038
the other Growers it's like okay let's

1377
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:53,639
what I'm just going to sit on these

1378
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:57,599
seeds along with all the other ones in

1379
01:05:53,639 --> 01:06:00,960
my freezer so yeah man uh if you like

1380
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:04,000
SSH if you are still in one of those

1381
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,240
areas where you cannot get clones that's

1382
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,519
how I would grade these seeds is you

1383
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:12,719
want to try SSH for the first time these

1384
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:15,719
seeds are a great way but you're not GNA

1385
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,679
find I don't think from all the reports

1386
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,278
I've gotten back I don't think you're

1387
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:23,199
going to find any sour in ss8 sour

1388
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:25,159
double so if you're looking for sour

1389
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,519
then you look at one of the other

1390
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:28,759
hybrids

1391
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:31,480
all right let's talk about skank

1392
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:34,920
dog that's gonna

1393
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:37,639
be that that's where you're GNA find the

1394
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,720
sour all right let's talk about the uh

1395
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:42,920
is it a skunk dog S1 that you used it's

1396
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:46,679
a skunk dog

1397
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:49,798
S1 uh that I kept

1398
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:52,519
for Rounds

1399
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:54,199
um I went into this phase where I was

1400
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:56,559
going to take it back to the '90s

1401
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:59,118
European growing scene where everybody

1402
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:01,839
just grew from seed didn't keep clones

1403
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:04,599
just keep it moving exploring all the

1404
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:07,880
time and so I ended up getting rid of

1405
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:10,880
that S1 and I really wish I hadn't

1406
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:13,480
because that is a plant that I actually

1407
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,079
enjoyed growing more than skunk dog and

1408
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,798
if if you followed anything I've done

1409
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,039
online from the forums Instagram you

1410
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:24,719
know I love Maui scun I think it's one

1411
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:27,920
of the greatest hybrids of all time I

1412
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,959
love the the taste it took me years

1413
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,318
before I reached that point where I I

1414
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,838
got sick of it and stopped smoking it

1415
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:38,318
for a while because it's so specifically

1416
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:42,278
stinky anyway move to the

1417
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:43,798
S1 uh the the word that came to mind

1418
01:07:42,278 --> 01:07:45,039
especially when I grew it I grew three

1419
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:47,318
of them

1420
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:51,680
Outdoors um along with a couple orange

1421
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:55,838
juice Bud crosses from from OB oh yeah

1422
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:59,318
obso yeah five or six plants out there

1423
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:02,558
and you could smell them for blocks here

1424
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:06,239
in the desert in the summer it was crazy

1425
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:10,319
I really expected the cops to show up

1426
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:13,519
and new medic you know at the time new

1427
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:16,399
new recreational grower loss um and I

1428
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,640
hit that with sour double and everything

1429
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:21,639
that I have

1430
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,079
smelled from that has been you know

1431
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,119
there are strains that can make your

1432
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:30,039
mouth water yeah um

1433
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:32,640
uh I use the term strain today after all

1434
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:35,319
the Kur fluffle yesterday online about

1435
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:38,440
using strain

1436
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:40,839
I just somebody trying to make his bones

1437
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:43,479
arguing with Chimera

1438
01:08:40,838 --> 01:08:46,278
or where was this

1439
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:48,039
Instagram what's that was this on

1440
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:50,640
Instagram where was this on

1441
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:52,278
Instagram yeah and uh I don't even know

1442
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,679
what started it because I don't follow

1443
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:56,960
the dude who started it but I I'm pretty

1444
01:08:54,679 --> 01:09:00,359
sure it went back to the old strand

1445
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,359
versus strain

1446
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:07,559
and we know you know but everything I

1447
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,560
just described about the last 30 years

1448
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,640
of my growing we didn't have medical

1449
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,480
textbooks that we were studying out of

1450
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:20,279
it was 100% broscience so I'll say

1451
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:22,879
strain I'll say pheno you know and all

1452
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:27,080
the kids can kiss my

1453
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:29,239
ass that's what's up so skunk dog yeah

1454
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:32,039
what was in Skunk dog I I can't remember

1455
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:36,599
off the top of my head skunk dog to the

1456
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:40,838
best of my knowledge I probably text

1457
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:43,838
Sean 50 times over the years asking

1458
01:09:40,838 --> 01:09:46,399
him and if I finally remember right I

1459
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:50,439
know it's a kimd bag seed and I think

1460
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:52,759
it's crossed to a skunk from the island

1461
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:55,839
of molai so

1462
01:09:52,759 --> 01:10:00,600
molai father I believe

1463
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:04,119
crossed with a Kim of some sort bag seat

1464
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:06,920
gotcha the s1's that I grew uh including

1465
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:10,880
the one I kept the Kim is obvious I'll

1466
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:13,440
never question that it look like Kim

1467
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,239
growing uh except for it kept if you've

1468
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,799
ever grown skunk dog it's got some

1469
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:21,279
really weird branches it uh it really

1470
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:23,320
goes crazy on side branch so the the

1471
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:26,238
plants and I I think I've got some picks

1472
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:28,439
up on Instagram um from when I grew them

1473
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:32,039
Outdoors it looks

1474
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:35,719
like Kim with the exact same branching

1475
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:37,840
from skunk do uh and that's that's when

1476
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:41,760
I first started using the descriptor

1477
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:43,480
skank because it just smelled skank and

1478
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,640
then when you hit power double the

1479
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:52,319
examples I've seen and smelled so far uh

1480
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:54,760
I would say that that if if I grew some

1481
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,719
of these hybrids some of the skank dog

1482
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:59,880
out you

1483
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,960
1990 every I would have sold it as

1484
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:05,039
skunk you know I been called it would

1485
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,920
have been referred to as skunk by

1486
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:09,880
everybody who smoked it or smelled it or

1487
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,079
was in the room with somebody who had a

1488
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:15,440
bag of it in their pocket it is skunk is

1489
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:19,679
the best descriptor yeah but I couldn't

1490
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:21,759
call dog uh so I called it skank dog

1491
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:25,960
yeah I like it I like that name

1492
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:28,880
anyways really really brought out

1493
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:33,239
Amplified the chem and

1494
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:35,679
added that sweetness to it

1495
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:37,839
uh I'm I'm getting ready to pop some

1496
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,840
more soon as these dab me are cleared

1497
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,679
I'm popping more of those I cannot wait

1498
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:48,480
to try some of that again I found a a

1499
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:48,480
tray a trim bin with probably a half

1500
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,560
ounce you know what I might still

1501
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:57,000
actually have it it's still over there

1502
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:01,960
uh maybe a half half oun of seeded bud

1503
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:04,760
so it was the it was the skunk dog flow

1504
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:09,800
with the seeds from the sour double P

1505
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:13,320
yeah yeah to of my tent for over a year

1506
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:16,199
uncovered dry right now but when I found

1507
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:19,319
it and I just kind of crumpled a few

1508
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:22,198
seeds out of a flower the smell hit me

1509
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:24,840
and I was like holy [ __ ] if I had to

1510
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:27,960
pick just one strain right now to pop

1511
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,400
seeds of out of everything in my

1512
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,439
collection it would be it would be more

1513
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:34,879
of the skin that's awesome that's sounds

1514
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:37,079
really good and we we talked about on

1515
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,840
the show um what we refer to is like the

1516
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,679
super skunk double up like if a a camera

1517
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,400
sour something with super skunk in it is

1518
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,239
then crossed to something else with sour

1519
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:49,000
or Cam in it they tend to align and make

1520
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:51,718
skunky [ __ ] [ __ ] almost every single

1521
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,840
time and it's it's it's gnarly it's it's

1522
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:55,399
and it's

1523
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:59,239
predictable another good example of that

1524
01:12:55,399 --> 01:13:01,960
was uh canado before he you know started

1525
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:05,279
selling seeds you know he he was work

1526
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:09,000
doing cross and he did a sour double

1527
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:13,079
reversal and he and he hit I think every

1528
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:16,600
clone that Colorado had was sure did he

1529
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:19,960
collected everything and he wanted to

1530
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:23,079
send gray he wanted to send gray

1531
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:26,480
School uh a 10 pack of each one of those

1532
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:30,359
sour double crosses to thank you him for

1533
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:34,599
releasing uh sour double yeah

1534
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:37,880
so so Sean told him at the time hey man

1535
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:40,800
I don't mess with post office but hit up

1536
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:44,000
Rob He he'll probably do it and I said

1537
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:47,520
hell yeah here's my address yeah he

1538
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,399
doubled up every pack and sent me in

1539
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:55,800
grce skull a pack of everything he' done

1540
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:59,359
from Durban to OG's to to all that and I

1541
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:03,440
um I popped either one seed or three

1542
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:04,399
seeds of KM hit with sour double uh

1543
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,119
reverse

1544
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:09,599
pollen

1545
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,639
and there was a keeper whether it was

1546
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,400
the one seed pop or the three seed Pop I

1547
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:16,239
can't remember which one but the plan I

1548
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:20,479
ended up with smelled like East Coast

1549
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:23,678
Sour Diesel on steroids yeah makes sense

1550
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:27,678
original cut that I got back in I think

1551
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:30,158
09 it it had that kind of sour diesel

1552
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,920
smell not not even a little bit watered

1553
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:35,279
down and I was really surprised by that

1554
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,800
smell yeah well makes sense though yeah

1555
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:41,279
I remember when he did

1556
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:45,000
that yeah I grew those seeds for years

1557
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:46,960
I've never explored any Jean Pool uh

1558
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,079
like I've explored the sour double Jean

1559
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:52,760
Pool all because canado wanted to hook

1560
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,319
gry skull up so that was pretty cool

1561
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,560
yeah he's a cool dude he's always been

1562
01:14:54,319 --> 01:15:00,840
super cool to me too I like him a lot

1563
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:04,080
the white sour dub is another cut which

1564
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,760
Sean still grows in San Diego uh that

1565
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,639
was the other one one of them was a one

1566
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,760
seat pop one was three seat pop uh and I

1567
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:14,600
got a keeper cut from each one of those

1568
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,199
uh one was the white sour dub I love

1569
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,320
that is that

1570
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:23,000
wubble what's that is it called

1571
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:25,960
wubble uh the cut that I kept we just

1572
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,520
called White sour du

1573
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:31,239
okay Sean could be calling it something

1574
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:35,040
else especially with the whole with the

1575
01:15:31,238 --> 01:15:38,319
company maybe um or maybe somebody else

1576
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:40,359
kept the cut too or maybe canado called

1577
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:44,198
it that but uh yeah I don't

1578
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:50,439
know that's like sour

1579
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:53,359
du cream you know yeah I bet dude smooth

1580
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:56,919
smooth tast comes around on did you get

1581
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:56,920
to grow any gg4 sour doubles

1582
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:02,559
no wonder how that one would

1583
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:05,439
be pretty

1584
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,960
interesting I mean bat cross if you get

1585
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:09,399
a little more sour to me the one thing

1586
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,840
that that

1587
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:17,839
gg4 kind of lack was

1588
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:19,960
was a distinct flavor yeah you know and

1589
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,639
maybe that was a little bit Jaded by the

1590
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:24,520
fact

1591
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:27,760
that everybody who had sour double at

1592
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:30,960
that time was still growing sour double

1593
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,400
when when you know Dawn started giving

1594
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:37,399
out Cuts yeah

1595
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:40,519
of and it's easier to grow it yields

1596
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:43,119
more than sour dub

1597
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:45,239
uh but when you're comparing the two I

1598
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:48,519
mean I never understood why somebody

1599
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:50,319
would take gg4 over sour du and I had

1600
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,880
that same point of view like when gg4

1601
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:53,599
came out I already had sour dub so I

1602
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,039
wasn't really interested in growing gg4

1603
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,840
the first like decade of it being out

1604
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:59,679
had no interest in it at all it ended up

1605
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,800
being a pretty good breeder though on

1606
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:05,239
its own in can you guys help me out here

1607
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:07,600
what's the overlap uh in terms of their

1608
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:08,759
genetics why would you compare them I

1609
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:14,360
guess as

1610
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:16,119
like sour Dub's a part of it gg4 came

1611
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:19,960
right what's

1612
01:17:16,119 --> 01:17:21,319
that didn't didn't G didn't grow that

1613
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,359
that's what it was right it was Sour

1614
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:27,238
double hit with mystery Allen yeah it

1615
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:28,679
was like they said sour dub chocolate

1616
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:31,319
Thai chem

1617
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:33,920
sis that's right yeah I don't know which

1618
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:36,119
one came and hit which or reversed or

1619
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,840
where they even found Kim sis to hit

1620
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:41,439
it it was interesting and this brings it

1621
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:44,920
back to the SDF threads it was

1622
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:48,638
interesting watching the beginning of uh

1623
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:51,920
of gorilla Gorilla Glue number

1624
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:55,800
four because on the

1625
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:59,920
forums you can see the blueprint for the

1626
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:03,199
modern hype hyping of a strength

1627
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:05,079
marketing the blueprint was burner

1628
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:08,479
online with

1629
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:11,359
cookies and I remember the beginning of

1630
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:15,759
Gorilla Glue number

1631
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:18,238
four you know Josie wasn't uh he wasn't

1632
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,199
a marketing machine he he wasn't really

1633
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:23,799
carrying that much it

1634
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:26,759
was it was another one or two members

1635
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:29,000
specifically who who kind of talked him

1636
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:32,400
and it said hey man you got something

1637
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
here in today's legal world you know you

1638
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,158
don't just let something like this go

1639
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,760
for nothing you can make money off of

1640
01:18:37,158 --> 01:18:39,759
this

1641
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,080
yeah and I'm pretty sure those posts

1642
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:52,679
would still be up on on one of the SDF

1643
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:54,279
threats probably the second one uh and

1644
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:56,520
it was really interesting watching

1645
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:59,479
people suggestions hey you should do

1646
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,360
this you should do that so it was It was

1647
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:03,439
kind of interesting watching the

1648
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:10,079
beginning

1649
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:10,079
of cannabis marketing from from online

1650
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:19,679
cookies and it was just it

1651
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:23,519
way the way it was done prior to

1652
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,399
burner doing his thing with cookies you

1653
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,400
know the

1654
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:30,238
guys who'd been smoking the longest

1655
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,559
would tell the young guys this is what

1656
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,638
you want to smoke this is the [ __ ] you

1657
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,400
know your friends would tell you hey man

1658
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:40,760
I just found this this is what you want

1659
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:43,279
but that turned around with cookies

1660
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:46,480
cookies the hype came before the flower

1661
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,519
for 90% of the people who were hyping

1662
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:51,119
they

1663
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:53,320
did you know you're on your second grow

1664
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:57,000
of all time you're in the beginnner

1665
01:19:53,319 --> 01:20:00,519
Forum and you're telling me the cookies

1666
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,719
is the best pot in the history of

1667
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,920
cannabis you know so I was always

1668
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:08,359
getting a little grouchy back then

1669
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:10,039
online I talked a lot of [ __ ] Don

1670
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:12,399
understood especially with Gorilla Glue

1671
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:15,719
number four still think it's over bright

1672
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:18,238
but if people enjoy it who gives a [ __ ]

1673
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:18,239
right

1674
01:20:20,198 --> 01:20:26,119
yeah3 but I seem like I'm the only

1675
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:30,158
person I know who can't stand hash plan

1676
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:32,079
133 things like that so I do miss the

1677
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:34,799
back and forth I do miss people being

1678
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:37,519
able to criticize each other without

1679
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,440
130,000 people sliding into your [ __ ]

1680
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,199
DMS telling you you don't you know what

1681
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:45,678
I

1682
01:20:42,198 --> 01:20:47,399
mean days were good yeah they were I I

1683
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,079
tended to get banned from every form

1684
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:51,599
because my [ __ ] mouth but you know it

1685
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:55,319
is what it

1686
01:20:51,600 --> 01:21:00,960
is editing all this

1687
01:20:55,319 --> 01:21:03,158
a coherent format for for your show yeah

1688
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,760
it'll be it'll be

1689
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:08,839
interesting I um I I also wanted to ask

1690
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:11,560
about the

1691
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:13,679
adub and whether that has any relation

1692
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,600
or is that just a coincidence with the

1693
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:23,039
name that's adub

1694
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:26,159
is sour double hit with uh

1695
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:28,279
alien alien do

1696
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:32,279
V2 or

1697
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:34,079
V1 something that OB did with alien dog

1698
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:35,000
gotcha yeah it was probably the V1 then

1699
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,960
if it was

1700
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,319
OBS or no no you know what I think it

1701
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:43,880
was grotech and

1702
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:47,479
uh this other dude who who came on to

1703
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:49,119
stf fairly early I'm having trouble

1704
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:50,919
remembering his name and I'm kind of

1705
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:54,238
embarrassed about that I think it was a

1706
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:56,840
project they did and some of the people

1707
01:21:54,238 --> 01:22:00,158
who who got the

1708
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:05,199
seeds uh krd was one of

1709
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:06,719
them and krd found ad dub and he was

1710
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:10,439
just listing them you know there was

1711
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:14,480
like ad dub BD Dub C dub Etc and the

1712
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:16,439
ones that were kept were adubb odub and

1713
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:19,000
something else so it's sour double hit

1714
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:23,519
with alien dog

1715
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:26,600
yeah uh and that's that's a very

1716
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:29,320
specific type plant also it's got a

1717
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:32,480
unique High the way I interpret it

1718
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:35,119
that's like uh smoking yourself into a

1719
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,879
bubble you know can't tell you how many

1720
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:40,479
days I was working in the garden and I

1721
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:42,719
would smoke ad dub and and I would find

1722
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:45,759
myself wandering like The Stereotype

1723
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:48,079
from the 80s like what am I doing what

1724
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,520
what was I mixing you know and

1725
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:53,519
I I did halfway and hadn't finished yet

1726
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,719
and something right beside it on the

1727
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,960
workbench that [ __ ] just put you into a

1728
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:00,279
another state of being that's like

1729
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,920
smoking

1730
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:09,158
concentrates like I don't buy into all

1731
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:11,639
the 30% this 28% this 3% this but when

1732
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:14,359
people were first starting to get things

1733
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:15,719
tested I think that was the second cut

1734
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:20,880
that I

1735
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:24,520
saw come up with a 30% re

1736
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:26,800
yeah which you know the reason I don't

1737
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,880
talking to it is you know those are

1738
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,159
adjustable it's all about where the

1739
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:35,400
machine is balanced at now yeah there

1740
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:37,198
are uses for it of course you know

1741
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:39,319
especially in breeding and selecting

1742
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,839
phenotypes and stuff like that but

1743
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:43,359
that's another thing I remember about

1744
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:45,480
aou was I think that was the second time

1745
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:50,238
behind Bruce Banner that anybody dared

1746
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:52,559
to say I got 30% THC yeah about getting

1747
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:54,959
laughed at and it's the one that made me

1748
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,280
believe hey I don't know if it's 30 but

1749
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:01,119
it's definitely got something something

1750
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:03,479
up in there yeah that was a great

1751
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,000
strength how about okay me and you've

1752
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:06,839
talked about it a bunch but I I don't

1753
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,719
think most people outside of a few of us

1754
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,880
really know about it the Dabney

1755
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:15,800
blue Dy blue was something Sean had more

1756
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:20,520
experience with

1757
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:26,279
um but he brought over some some of the

1758
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:30,679
Dabney uh Afghani kush yeah uh very blue

1759
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:34,359
that's like that's

1760
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:38,158
near I've smelled besides Old Blue from

1761
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:42,238

1762
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:43,879

1763
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:46,959
I don't know what the original dab me

1764
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:49,440

hold of the guy or he got a hold of me

1767
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:58,079

1771
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,159
circle it is I don't know if I don't

1772
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,199
know if I'm ever allowed to touch it yet

1773
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:15,158
we'll see well one of the crosses I made

1774

1782
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:39,639
a lot of that pollen on the East Coast s

1783
01:25:38,118 --> 01:25:41,920
Diesel and we hit a few other things

1784
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:44,760
with the purple Joy which was a purple

1785
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,760
plant that was I remember that kind of

1786
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:52,560
purple plant that I dug I mean that deep

1787
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:54,800
perfumey AF it was it was in nepes um

1788
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,320
nepes Afghani hybrid if I remember

1789
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:01,119
correctly well that makes sense too the

1790
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:02,960
the nepes yeah uh but it had that purple

1791
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:05,479
flavor that I like I don't really go for

1792
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:09,319
the GDP so much the

1793
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:13,559
graes but I like those old those old

1794
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:18,039
perfumey stinky small buds but they

1795
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:20,840
don't take much I like those purples so

1796
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:23,679
so he brought over the pollen uh the F1

1797
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:26,239
seeds I sent most of them to the server

1798
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,239
fund auction

1799
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,560
mag among the other other people who

1800
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:33,840
bought them was uh a guy who went by

1801
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:37,400
Brando

1802
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:41,000
MK okay and heend being head of

1803

something for Prime Wellness in

1804
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:48,679
Pennsylvania which is a I guess a big

1805

ass company and he happened to take the

1806
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:54,199
seeds in there and pop them there they

1807
01:26:52,118 --> 01:26:55,960
became Prime Wellness property as far as

1808
01:26:54,198 --> 01:26:57,238
far as he was concerned you know as far

1809
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,719
as

1810
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:03,678
he say these are my personal stash you

1811
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:06,359
know um but they to this day they still

1812
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:10,800
run two fenos that they call Sweet blue

1813
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:13,359
uh sour blueberry oh nice make shatter

1814
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,760
they make all the concentrates out of it

1815
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:17,960
I go through the uh matter of fact on

1816
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,880
their website they have it listed as sub

1817
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:22,719
Rob Sour

1818
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:24,719
Diesel um which it wasn't sub Rob Sour

1819
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:27,880
Diesel it was

1820
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,520
diesel clone yeah but I think that had

1821
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:33,800
marked on his packaging was

1822
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:36,159
subro you know and then diesel cross

1823
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:39,480
with dab blue so that's what I've got

1824
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:43,679
going a Guy in Wales bought him in like

1825

2010 he lives in Wales so he he told me

1826
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:50,039
uh he told me he says I've got tens of

1827
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,920
thousands of dollars of seeds in my deep

1828
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:53,800
freeze that I never got to Growing he

1829
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,158
goes some of them are yours why don't I

1830
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,119
just send back your way and he did

1831
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:01,719
that's

1832
01:27:57,118 --> 01:28:04,079
awesome got six going in the in the bed

1833
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:06,158
tent right now in perpetuity I cracked

1834
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:08,118
them like eight months ago and I've just

1835
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:10,519
been recycling moms because I haven't I

1836
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:12,319
haven't flowered any Myer yeah that's

1837
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:15,840
been going on for a while

1838
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:19,279
bro I gota do I gotta do it I got OG and

1839
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:21,719
sour double coming so I need to it's

1840
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:24,880
real interesting when you're running

1841
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:28,198
literally just personal growth

1842
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,440
yeah I went from having enough up room

1843
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:35,399
and we weren't even big I've never at no

1844
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:38,319
stage in my career would I be considered

1845
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:42,599
a BigTime commercial grower by today's

1846
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:44,960
standards sure and no same I've done

1847
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:48,880
compares to the 100 lighters 200

1848
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:51,239
lighters thousand lighters you know um

1849
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:54,560
but I used to have room for stashing

1850
01:28:51,238 --> 01:28:57,319
anything I wanted cracking seeds and

1851
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,360
an extra tray over there in the corner

1852
01:28:57,319 --> 01:29:03,359
it's different when you

1853
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:08,039
are when you're just running a

1854
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:10,679
little 5 by 10 by 810 you know

1855
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:12,079
yeah I was going to ask you because

1856
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,600
obviously we have we have lots of

1857
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,559
different clones than names that we

1858
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,480
could ask you about but I did want to

1859
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,560
know because you were you know just

1860
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:21,118
referring to your current situation like

1861
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:23,039
what are you working on now and like

1862
01:29:21,118 --> 01:29:27,118
what what do you think the future holds

1863
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,118
for you in terms of um the

1864
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:33,279
PS um right now I'm not working on

1865
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:38,158
anything man I I I've been smoking the

1866
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:41,198
SSH dub for going on a total the last

1867
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:43,599
Harvest of it for like six months now I

1868
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:45,439
just started going over to another when

1869
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,079
I moved down here to New Mexico there's

1870
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:50,158
another oldtime icy mager that I've

1871
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:52,920
known forever online who lives here and

1872
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:54,679
I go buy and get samples from them and

1873
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,719
uh it's just really slowed down the

1874
01:29:54,679 --> 01:30:00,000
flowering schedule plus I kind of I I

1875
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:02,239
grew a little more than I needed to and

1876
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,719
I don't I don't I don't sell weat

1877
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:08,359
anymore you know yeah uh I've

1878
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:13,359
been the real work I've been putting in

1879
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:16,198
is judging that SSH dub lately um but I

1880
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:19,719
do have plans for every three sets of

1881
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:21,319
plans I make I usually carry out one and

1882
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:24,760
the next thing I'm going to do is see if

1883
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:29,799
this East Coast sour dab me is worth

1884
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:32,440
doing a seed increase and see I got this

1885
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:35,159
goes back sorry here I am derailing

1886
01:30:32,439 --> 01:30:36,599
conversation again when I was when I was

1887
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:39,679
living in b

1888
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:41,280
s around

1889
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:45,520
2013

1890
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:50,039
2015 maybe my house got burgled and I

1891
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:51,760
had in the freezer I had a b with every

1892
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:54,399
Cross I'd ever

1893
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:56,719
made um not to mention all my friends

1894
01:30:54,399 --> 01:31:01,079
had ever made anything I'd ever bought

1895
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:04,279
traded for and in them I had a a whole

1896
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:07,760
bunch of those of both F1 and F2 East

1897
01:31:04,279 --> 01:31:10,920
Coast sour dabing that I had always

1898
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:13,320
planned uh because of the success that

1899
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,199
Prime Wellness had with 10 of those

1900
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:17,719
seats I always had plans to work that

1901
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:21,039
line and maybe do some real actual

1902
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:22,800
breeding work with it uh but the thief

1903
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:25,238
along with a bunch of other [ __ ] got all

1904
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:29,960
the seeds

1905
01:31:25,238 --> 01:31:33,479
so I need to find out just how

1906
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:36,480
stiff these East Coast Sour Diesel

1907
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:39,839
genetics come through in these seeds and

1908
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:43,599
just how hardcore the the dab me Kush

1909
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:49,039
does um and see if it's worth trying

1910
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:49,039
to to increase and do something with

1911
01:31:49,639 --> 01:31:55,679
those th suck bro very

1912
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:58,319
C

1913
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:02,880
these always [ __ ] [ __ ]

1914
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:04,840
up yeah yeah like yeah I also want I

1915
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,118
want to do another sour dub reversal

1916
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:10,039
because I missed some plants I I didn't

1917
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:12,279
I didn't get the the chimd cut in time

1918
01:32:10,039 --> 01:32:14,920
when I made those seeds and going back

1919
01:32:12,279 --> 01:32:18,079
to that that plant I got from canado

1920
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:20,639
hitting kimd with sourd these are

1921
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:23,920
crosses these sour dub crosses are

1922
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:27,079
something that I begged my friends who

1923
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,319
make and sell seeds to do I didn't want

1924
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:30,399
to do any of this stuff man I wanted to

1925
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:33,840
move

1926
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:36,879
on but the the Cannabis world that the

1927
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:41,000
demand in the industry seems to have

1928
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:44,400
moved on from some genetics

1929
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
prematurely yeah I'm not I'm saying hey

1930
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:50,439
you know go get the sherbets and the

1931
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,600
biscottis and the biscuits and and the

1932
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:55,319
whatever hell else pastries are out

1933
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:57,440
there but don't you know down a little

1934
01:32:55,319 --> 01:33:00,158
bit you know

1935
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:03,559
because there's a lot of

1936
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:07,079
the there's a lot of the cuts that

1937
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:11,119
came in the era of the forums that we

1938
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:13,840
should still be concentrating on I

1939
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:16,238
mean you know I

1940
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:18,800
don't I don't I don't want to take the

1941
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:21,359
journey away from from everybody but at

1942
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,840
least a small percentage of people need

1943
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:28,759
to go back and start working with the

1944
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:30,960
sour and the m and the ogs because those

1945
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:34,320
are Gene

1946
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,000
pools and oddly enough I've talked about

1947
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:37,639
it like I had people hitting me up all

1948
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
the time asking for OG Cuts because

1949
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:41,639
nobody kept them like not nobody but and

1950
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,880
a lot of people enough people dropped

1951
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:45,920
them that a lot of these big you know

1952
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:47,440
places that these people used to run

1953
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,760
like they don't even have ogs anymore

1954
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:54,599
not pure ogs you know and that gets us

1955
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:58,520
circled back to SDF which is the the the

1956
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,520
thread I'm supposed to be staying on

1957
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:08,719
sorry we all had at one point not only

1958
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:11,239
did all the p91 bull rider you know all

1959
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:14,840
we all had not just one but we all had

1960
01:34:11,238 --> 01:34:17,599
all those cuts yeah you had in your

1961
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,199
bedroom you had p91 in your bedroom you

1962
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:24,079
had madness in your bedroom you had

1963
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:27,599
catpiss you had Hogs breath and they all

1964
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:30,639
disappeared and you know lame eight I

1965
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,520
really do because I wasn't one who had

1966
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:36,760
never had

1967
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:40,159
access to that many Cuts you know at one

1968
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:43,800
time yeah and the only one who went

1969
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:46,960
crazy and would just get cuts from eight

1970
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:49,520
and bedge them and flower them in a tent

1971
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:53,800
with 14 other kinds with single plant

1972
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:55,920
each you know of 15 different guts uh

1973
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:58,719
and you would just you know move on from

1974
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:01,079
them and you wouldn't keep moms because

1975
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:04,920
you got another 20 from eight when you

1976
01:35:01,079 --> 01:35:07,479
came to and and basically we all thought

1977
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:10,639
that p91 would stick around we all

1978
01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:12,319
thought bull around and they just up and

1979
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:14,480
disappeared in the matter of like a year

1980
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:17,319
and a half yeah they

1981
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:21,000
did damn shame we didn't know what we it

1982
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:24,599
was like being cut drunk you know we all

1983
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:29,198
just ate that [ __ ] up and forgot

1984
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:30,520
B cyle repeats itself how it goes dude

1985
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:32,238
we always thought everything was to be

1986
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:34,320
around

1987
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:36,519
forever yeah because maybe this is

1988
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,960
almost more forat but when I look at you

1989
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,040
know I went through some of the threads

1990
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:41,960
and piled a whole list of of clones that

1991
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:44,439
stood out to me when I look at some of

1992
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:46,960
the names you know Chernobyl strawberry

1993
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:48,319
cream day recer it also strikes me that

1994
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,679
of course this is some of these are some

1995
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:51,000
of the cuts that Matt worked with

1996
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:54,960
earlier as

1997
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,880
well um so yeah it's super cool to make

1998
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,800
that connection I didn't I didn't

1999
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,520
actually realize I don't

2000
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:02,840
think I like that strawberry cream yeah

2001
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,320
yeah you you would have run the same

2002
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,279
exact clone that I did because mine came

2003
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,399
via

2004
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:10,039
eight yeah it was good cut yeah it was

2005
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:12,599

strawberry I had another one I don't

2008
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,320

2009
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:20,319
get Cuts I'm sure everybody did from me

2010
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:22,039
where something went wrong and the

2011
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:24,479
information wasn't passed right but I

2012
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:28,719
remember calling one

2013
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:34,479
which stood for body odor Berry that was

2014

2016
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,560
from those

2017
01:36:37,238 --> 01:36:43,638
threats what else you come up with let's

2018
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:47,600
see so we've already mentioned p91 hugs

2019
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:51,319
breath bull rider so I saw GDP grap a

2020
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:55,679
cat piss Purple Kush green ice Albert

2021
01:36:51,319 --> 01:36:59,279
Walker Chernobyl uh strawberry cream we

2022
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:02,600
mentioned OB Betsy Master Kush D Green

2023
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:06,519
Crack Green Crack was a big one down

2024
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:08,480
there so green ice was something that

2025
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:11,719
was around for a very short period of

2026
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:14,759
time that was C green uh he had gotten

2027
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:19,480
some seeds from the original gg4 which

2028
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:22,560
was gorilla gold 4 Yeah by Bri up in

2029
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:24,638
Canada which was an awesome strain

2030
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,600
indoor or

2031
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:30,480
it was kind of on the Bland side for

2032
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:32,400
indoor weed in so in Southern California

2033
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:36,158
at the time

2034
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:39,638
but Cali found a male and he hit Green

2035
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:42,118
Crack along with a couple other cats and

2036
01:37:39,639 --> 01:37:45,039
so that's where green ice was born and

2037
01:37:42,118 --> 01:37:47,559
that is a strain that still to this day

2038
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:50,158
I still whenever I talk to him I'm like

2039
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:54,239
hey man dude remember green ice yeah

2040
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:57,198
he's probably dude I know I fcked up I

2041
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:57,198
shouldn't have lost

2042
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:03,119
it but uh but yeah that was I remember

2043
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:05,639
the flavor of that I haven't hit that

2044
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:06,960
since probably 2007 or eight that was in

2045
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:11,239
the

2046
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:13,399
beginning uh and and I still remember I

2047
01:38:11,238 --> 01:38:15,079
remember that that plant that was

2048
01:38:13,399 --> 01:38:18,039
awesome I'll bet you not many people

2049
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:21,719
remember it but uh I enjoyed that very

2050
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:23,960
much do you remember ak-48 God's gift

2051
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:26,920
they flown around

2052
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:28,800
yeah I don't think I grew it but I say

2053
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:32,679
that all the time and then I go through

2054
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:36,239
the the forums yeah yeah did I did grow

2055
01:38:32,679 --> 01:38:39,719
that but I remember growing AK-47 I

2056
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:41,799
remember growing Cherry I remember AK-47

2057
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:46,719
When's the earliest that came

2058
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:49,320
out [ __ ] I don't know probably mid 90s

2059
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:53,279
yeah because when I was in Portland

2060
01:38:49,319 --> 01:38:55,960
growing uh blueberry there was one guy

2061
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:59,158
that one one of the very few guys we let

2062
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:02,719
in on our secret he was a grower also

2063
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:05,519
and he was growing these these newer

2064
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:09,679
seeds uh

2065
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:12,480
AK-47 and white widow and he had he

2066
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:15,560
selected cuts from both of those and

2067
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,959
that was pretty awesome weed I'd never

2068
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:20,360
really had

2069
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:22,399
AK-47 that lived up to that AK-47 that

2070
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:24,279
what's his name was grown in Portland

2071
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:27,559
back in the day

2072
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:30,719
yeah good sh trying to think like i'

2073
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:35,199
I've had a few good AK-47s um there was

2074
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:37,560
like a lemon AK there was the uh like

2075
01:39:35,198 --> 01:39:39,479
Cedar AK but then there's also the

2076
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:43,000
Cherry AK that went around San Diego and

2077
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:44,959
it was beautiful Frosty no density to it

2078
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,920
it was Fluffy and not very potent but it

2079
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,840
was it was really good tasting that was

2080
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:51,920
about it for it it's still floating

2081
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:55,199
around oh yeah yeah I'd used it in the

2082
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:59,239
Cherry Berry that I not too long ago

2083
01:39:55,198 --> 01:40:00,519
yeah I enjoyed it yeah me too I I was

2084
01:39:59,238 --> 01:40:02,879
stoked to see it again even though it's

2085
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:06,040
not super potent um it is a great

2086
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:08,000
breeder especially for those CHS cherry

2087
01:40:06,039 --> 01:40:10,639
cough

2088
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,599
drop yeah now I've already I remember a

2089
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:15,560
couple of the Clones you listed thousand

2090
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:17,679
uh popped off in my mind immediately but

2091
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:20,199
I've already forgotten what they were

2092
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:23,560
so um I think ones we haven't talked

2093
01:40:20,198 --> 01:40:26,359
about yet like maybe choby or dayer

2094
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:28,400
Walker any of those was a seed line from

2095
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:32,679
TGA so there's a lot of different cuts

2096
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:36,118
of that yeah yeah that's the Deo Walker

2097
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:38,760
remember that walker uh Shan I think

2098
01:40:36,118 --> 01:40:40,639
Shawn was the one who got that one and

2099
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:42,840
it was

2100
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:44,840
Albert uh

2101
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:47,480
and

2102
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:51,239
Fletch I think all Fletch even needed to

2103
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:54,238
see was the veg picks of that plan and

2104
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:56,000
he was like hey bro that ain't that's

2105
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:57,959
not Albert Walker and it turned out it

2106
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,840
wasn't of course he was he was right on

2107
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:02,399
with that one yeah so we called Walker

2108
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,599
just because we were too lazy to come we

2109
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:05,799
didn't know if we were going to end up

2110
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:08,079
keeping it tell you what man that plant

2111
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:11,480
is a citrus

2112
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:15,479
explosion yeah it was a nice plant dude

2113
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:17,759
he tried taking the Citrus down or not

2114
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:22,799
uh the first reversal I ever tried was

2115
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:25,639
Tahoe OG Kush oh wow hard one I had room

2116
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:28,639
and I was spraying it every day and it

2117
01:41:25,639 --> 01:41:32,000
just wasn't going well and so I said

2118
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:36,480
Sean happened to come over one day and

2119
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:39,719
he got in there and he found a pin prick

2120
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:41,959
of pollen somewhere on that plant and he

2121
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:46,239
ran upstairs and he

2122
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:49,560
hit and he hit uh dega Walker yeah with

2123
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:51,198
it think he got three seeds grew all

2124
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:54,000
three of them out and one of them is

2125
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:58,719
still around uh it's called

2126
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:01,399
Cactus cool okay yeah yeah cooler cut

2127
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:03,800
comes from and and we always swore we

2128
01:42:01,399 --> 01:42:04,920
were going to reverse Tahoe or or one of

2129
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:08,159
the

2130
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:11,118
ogs uh and hit it again and try to bat

2131
01:42:08,158 --> 01:42:15,399
that Citrus down a little bit

2132
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:19,519
more full of that in a room it's it's

2133
01:42:15,399 --> 01:42:23,879
overwhelming it's too much like I Citrus

2134
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:25,920
for it's crazy how much citrus

2135
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,359
that yeah I was bummed when I found out

2136
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,480
that wasn't real Albert Walker because

2137
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:30,039
that was one of the ones that I [ __ ]

2138
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:31,559
with too and I was like oh yeah we got

2139
01:42:30,039 --> 01:42:35,399
the real Albert Walker we got that down

2140
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:38,880
here it turned out I've never smoked

2141
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:41,279
grown knowingly smoked Albert Walker and

2142
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:44,359
that's a like you said that's one I was

2143
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:46,840
wanted to try yeah same I i' I've never

2144
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:48,198
seen a real one or smoked it or wouldn't

2145
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,679
even know what it smells like nothing

2146
01:42:48,198 --> 01:42:52,319
about it

2147
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:54,719
really if that one isn't it you know

2148
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:57,559
that's my only experience with

2149
01:42:54,719 --> 01:43:03,319
it what uh what was your favorite San

2150
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:05,880
Diego cut I was so partial to to Hog's

2151
01:43:03,319 --> 01:43:09,079
Breath I as question I probably didn't

2152
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:11,039
need to for sentimental if nothing else

2153
01:43:09,079 --> 01:43:13,800
you know and the Clockwork one that came

2154
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:15,158
from uh Doug this dude crazy Doug down

2155
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,639
there Doug knew everyone he was the one

2156
01:43:15,158 --> 01:43:20,238
who hooked me up with James in the first

2157
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,800
place um and the whole Hogs breath crew

2158
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:23,678
but he had you know like there's an

2159
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:26,520
Apollo 13 cut he had down there that was

2160
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:29,800
really good uh he gave me Fire OG really

2161
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:31,920
early on he gave me KMD really early on

2162
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:34,039
so like yeah he was that dude was

2163
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:36,760
connected to

2164
01:43:34,039 --> 01:43:38,920
everyone sorry guys just wanted to ask

2165
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:41,840
here and Matt maybe this is obvious but

2166
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:43,039
I I'm just like it's not clear to me

2167
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,760
what's the overlap between the Hogs

2168
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:47,920
breath crew and San Diego's finest um in

2169
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,159
terms of people with they lots of

2170
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:52,279
crossovers

2171
01:43:49,158 --> 01:43:54,118
or not really it was just family like

2172
01:43:52,279 --> 01:43:56,158
the the Hogs family was there they ran

2173
01:43:54,118 --> 01:43:58,079
unified collective in San Diego and you

2174
01:43:56,158 --> 01:44:00,960
know people that you could go in there

2175
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:04,319
and talk to him anytime the dude who who

2176
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:05,920
like local groups basically local local

2177
01:44:04,319 --> 01:44:07,479
different groups and Hog's Breath was

2178
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:11,158
just that well known in San Diego that

2179
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:11,158
everybody knew it it was it was the

2180
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:17,238
staple um do we want to talk about the

2181
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:19,439
bull rider or we is everyone sick of

2182
01:44:17,238 --> 01:44:21,319
like bring it up once in a while I don't

2183
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,479
know anything about bull rider myself

2184
01:44:21,319 --> 01:44:24,359
because I only ever had a fake bull

2185
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:28,799
rider

2186
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:31,559
uh bull rider probably overall is was

2187
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,920
probably my favorite of the San Diego CS

2188
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:36,840
yeah I love I love the smell the smell

2189
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:39,158
and The Taste was just you know I barely

2190
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,079
even remembered if I'm being honest but

2191
01:44:39,158 --> 01:44:44,238
I

2192
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:47,760
remember you know when I first got

2193
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:50,839
here I just come off smoking blueberry

2194
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:54,360
for four years yeah

2195
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:57,199
Straight had become a big thing for me

2196
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:58,960
uh and I thought I was a snob you know

2197
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:02,319
thought I knew what I was

2198
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:04,158
doing uh and bull rider was the one that

2199
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:05,799
took the place of the blue rider for me

2200
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:09,759
because it gave me all the flavor that I

2201
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:09,760
could want from from a

2202
01:45:10,039 --> 01:45:16,319
dank sour but not Sour Diesel

2203
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:19,519
perspective it was it was really dark

2204
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:22,118
dank weed to me and did old Betsy did

2205
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,280
old Betsy cross your path down there

2206
01:45:22,118 --> 01:45:26,359
yeah but you know I used to get old

2207
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:29,319
Betsy from the same guy who I got

2208
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:31,319
everything else from but here's where

2209
01:45:29,319 --> 01:45:34,039
everything differs for me when I think

2210
01:45:31,319 --> 01:45:37,198
back to the old Betsy that he was

2211
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:40,679
getting me I think of really dark purple

2212
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:43,039
almost black Leaf weed oh

2213
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:45,079
interesting I wasn't that big a fan of

2214
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:47,679
and it wasn't just once or twice it was

2215
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:50,079
a few times before he even quit bringing

2216
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:54,440
it when he would bring me his little

2217
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:57,559
Briefcase full of samples and [ __ ]

2218
01:45:54,439 --> 01:46:01,839
um because I I literally thought it was

2219
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:04,440
just a man cut but I I had to wonder

2220
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:07,319
since then was I getting the real but

2221
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:10,479
why would he get you know all the other

2222
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:12,198
legit [ __ ] and not Betsy yeah thing

2223
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:15,439
turned out to when I had to start going

2224
01:46:12,198 --> 01:46:17,519
other places when I got pee when I got

2225
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:19,719
you know Hogs when I got any of that it

2226
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:23,280
was the same thing that he used to get

2227
01:46:19,719 --> 01:46:25,198
me uh but then I see old Betsy plants

2228
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:26,559
growing that are green all the way

2229
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:29,839
through and

2230
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:32,599
yeah being described is not what so I

2231
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,920
don't know maybe like he he got mad he

2232
01:46:32,599 --> 01:46:36,719
had more than one connect you know he

2233
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:40,039
there was only one connect that he got

2234
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:43,760
Madness from so maybe he had that he

2235
01:46:40,039 --> 01:46:43,760
went to get old Betsy

2236
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:54,159
from to what genuine old Betsy was I

2237
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:55,639
don't think I had the real deal um how

2238
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:58,238
about blueberry Hog's Breath remember

2239
01:46:55,639 --> 01:47:03,039
when that came around at

2240
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:03,879
all I remember the you know the the name

2241
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:07,118
yeah

2242
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:11,079
yeah but I don't know that I ever got

2243
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:13,359
any of that once I once I see I got here

2244
01:47:11,079 --> 01:47:18,519
in 99 and I wasn't grown right away but

2245
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:23,679
I was growing Again by 2001 2002 by

2246
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:25,239
then I was no longer you know buying a

2247
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:28,639
I was growing enough to keep myself

2248
01:47:25,238 --> 01:47:30,439
going here around yeah that makes sense

2249
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,520
yeah that was I just remember when that

2250
01:47:30,439 --> 01:47:34,198
finally got released and he let it out

2251
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:36,400
like you could throw a rock and hit it

2252
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:39,559
like it was in every [ __ ] grow room

2253
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:44,198
of every [ __ ] kid in San Diego for a

2254
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:47,679
while yeah kept my grow secret from well

2255
01:47:44,198 --> 01:47:51,759
as best good for the first years I was

2256
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:55,039
growing in San Diego I used to uh I used

2257
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,760
to use I used to run apartments and they

2258
01:47:55,039 --> 01:48:00,439
had to have a walk-in closet and then I

2259
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:04,239
would just basically take about 80% of

2260
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:07,559
the closet then build out of Styrofoam a

2261
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:11,118
wall that I can just door

2262
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:12,280
into um got pretty good at that too we

2263
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:15,000
ended

2264
01:48:12,279 --> 01:48:18,198
up it was kind of cool to build rooms

2265
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:21,760
out of Styrofoam small rooms oh yeah but

2266
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:25,158
we got to the point where we built it

2267
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:28,239
had 12T ceilings in this

2268
01:48:25,158 --> 01:48:34,198
building and we built

2269
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:36,439
a 16 by 12 by 12 growroom two of the

2270
01:48:34,198 --> 01:48:38,399
four walls were just built out of

2271
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:44,839
completely out of Styrofoam duct tape

2272
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:48,238
and spray epoxy yeah about four in

2273
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:52,119
thick that's way to do

2274
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:54,519
it you leave the ventilation system on

2275
01:48:52,118 --> 01:48:56,799
overnight and suck in the walls or blow

2276
01:48:54,520 --> 01:49:01,639
the walls out then you just call in a

2277
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:05,000
coked out Russian to frame it in for you

2278
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:06,840
and I appreciate the uh the tip on that

2279
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,238
book that you told me to get too the The

2280
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:12,000
Afghani one what was it called didn't it

2281
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:14,439
yeah what was it called do you

2282
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,639
remember I'd have to go into my I'll

2283
01:49:14,439 --> 01:49:18,638
have to look it's a really killer book

2284
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:22,000
though it's really well

2285
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:23,679
done Afghanistan the kingdom of cannabis

2286
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:28,319
yeah something like that

2287
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:30,639
yeah yeah yeah it's very similar to

2288
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:34,439
chiac yeah

2289
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:36,239
yeah the story as it you know as it

2290
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:38,359
happened I'll tell you what yeah you

2291
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:41,479
need to do people need to do more

2292
01:49:38,359 --> 01:49:44,960
episodes on hash on

2293
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:48,519
hashish uh because it's

2294
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:50,279
the there's no blueprint you know and

2295
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:52,960
for a couple years I was going through

2296
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:55,920
your book stash and explaining what was

2297
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:58,520
looking for I wanted the basic blueprint

2298
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:01,399
I wanted okay this is where you start

2299
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:03,599
when you make cash and this is what you

2300
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:06,000
can expect and this is what you should

2301
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:08,520
do and you can do that with growing

2302
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,439
flowers you can do that with living soil

2303
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:15,560
you can get that information on any

2304
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:18,519
aspect of growing but for but for making

2305
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:21,360
dry sift hash it's just not out there

2306
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:23,000
and I couldn't understand uh why it

2307
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:25,238
wasn't out there why isn't there a look

2308
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,439
this is how you make dry sift Dash and

2309
01:50:25,238 --> 01:50:31,678
now now I understand because it's it's

2310
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:35,279
different every single time man it's

2311
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:38,399
it's such fluid art that is done so many

2312
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:41,078
different ways with the same basic

2313
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:43,559
tools uh yeah I think people need to

2314
01:50:41,078 --> 01:50:45,840
start talking about hashish more

2315
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:47,560
concentrates in general but specifically

2316
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,239
dry

2317
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:52,159
SI I

2318
01:50:50,238 --> 01:50:54,439
think yeah you've done some beautiful

2319
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:55,319
dry SI stuff that I've seen I appreciate

2320
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,439
that a

2321
01:50:55,319 --> 01:51:01,158
lot I

2322
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:04,078
really don't like smoking just flow

2323
01:51:01,158 --> 01:51:07,198
anymore you know as obsessed as I've

2324
01:51:04,078 --> 01:51:08,799
been with growing for my entire adult

2325
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:13,479
life back into my

2326
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:17,719
teens uh it is now second seat it's just

2327
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:20,439
a step to getting to making hash you

2328
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:22,719
know what I mean yeah yeah it's like it

2329
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:26,638
was the penultimate it was the

2330
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:28,279
destination for the first 40 Years of my

2331
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:32,880
experience with

2332
01:51:28,279 --> 01:51:34,078
cannabis uh and now it's just third to

2333
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,880
the last

2334
01:51:34,078 --> 01:51:39,639
step yeah yeah well you do a damn good

everybody who's who's getting going on

2340
01:51:53,359 --> 01:52:00,359
I'm happy that not nearly as many people

2341
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:03,320
are going to jail for it uh I think it's

2342
01:52:00,359 --> 01:52:06,519
[ __ ] great and if I were 25 years

2343
01:52:03,319 --> 01:52:11,359
younger I'd be you know I'd be all over

2344
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:14,280
it but sure it's so nice to be this age

2345
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:16,399
where see for example you don't always

2346
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:19,238
want to see behind the curtain right

2347
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:22,279
yeah you know grew up a fanatic of

2348
01:52:19,238 --> 01:52:24,000
Harley-Davidson motorcycles loved Harley

2349
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:26,399
love the lifestyle love the

2350
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:29,800
fictionalized lifestyle love true

2351
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:31,118
lifestyle Lov writing all that stuff I

2352
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:34,639
went to work for

2353
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:39,598
Harley-Davidson and I still love it but

2354
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:44,000
now I know it's it's a job it's a lots

2355
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:46,279
for a lot of people to put that image

2356
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:50,960
that I fell in love with that's

2357
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:53,039
so that takes a lot of work to keep once

2358
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,480
you see that it just takes makes a

2359
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:57,880
little edge of the magic off you know

2360
01:52:55,479 --> 01:53:00,279
what I mean just a little bit it

2361
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:02,000
actually opens up a whole new world you

2362
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:06,000
know uh

2363
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:10,359

Miss that being the focus of my

2366

2372
01:53:32,599 --> 01:53:37,039
anything where tax money goes to law

2373
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,400
enforcement you know what I me I you

2374
01:53:37,039 --> 01:53:41,719

2375
01:53:39,399 --> 01:53:44,118
episode in and enough yeah me and you

2376

hours I'm happy with what's going on see

2378
01:53:47,238 --> 01:53:53,879
at this point I'm just talking I'm not

2379
01:53:49,279 --> 01:53:57,519
even thinking of the podcast I'm

2380
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:59,840
yeah um now we love

2381
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,880
that yeah here in New Mexico I don't

2382
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:04,599
even know the laws I

2383
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:07,400
literally made myself be ignorant of

2384
01:54:04,599 --> 01:54:09,000
laws I don't know if any of the tax goes

2385
01:54:07,399 --> 01:54:11,598
to law enforcement out here and I don't

2386
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,118
want to [ __ ] know yeah because that

2387
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:18,000
[ __ ] just ruins it for me talk about

2388
01:54:14,118 --> 01:54:20,679
losing the magic bro yeah yeah no I I

2389
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,679
look they got some really cool [ __ ] in

2390
01:54:20,679 --> 01:54:24,639
in the legal scene out here and I'll

2391
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:27,800
tell you what since it went recreational

2392
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:30,279
a couple years ago the quality has

2393
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:34,400
skyrocketed which doesn't take much all

2394
01:54:30,279 --> 01:54:35,759
you need is a Cali pipeline for cuts you

2395
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:39,118
know yeah

2396
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:41,360
right Skyrock but I haven't partaking at

2397
01:54:39,118 --> 01:54:43,799
all I've never been in a dispensary out

2398
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:45,479
here in three and a half years I've

2399
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,679
never

2400
01:54:45,479 --> 01:54:50,519
shopped

2401
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:55,000
uh I did look into they have macro

2402
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:58,719
licenses here they maxes out I think at

2403
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:02,560
a few hundred plants yeah somebody who

2404
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:06,078
is at least zoned right can can make an

2405
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:09,639
honest Mom and Pop Shop

2406
01:55:06,078 --> 01:55:12,359
attempt uh here in New Mexico especially

2407
01:55:09,639 --> 01:55:14,920
in Southern New Mexico where everything

2408
01:55:12,359 --> 01:55:16,359
the focus is always on Mom and Pop you

2409
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:20,920
know

2410
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:22,679
small down here from food to art to you

2411
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:25,800
know it's a great place they could velop

2412
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:29,039
a really they could develop a really

2413
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:31,800
cool cannabis scene here in Los crus

2414
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:33,279
they' have to CH one thing another

2415
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,320
another thing that just I'm Zero

2416
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:37,238
Tolerance

2417
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:39,198
on for personal grow I can have 12

2418
01:55:37,238 --> 01:55:42,238
plants here right

2419
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:44,759
yeah if I have six in flour I'm limited

2420
01:55:42,238 --> 01:55:48,559
to six in veg

2421
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:51,440
yeah you want to you want to set the

2422
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:54,400
number of what I can flow at six and

2423
01:55:51,439 --> 01:55:56,198
charge me at tax essentially for

2424
01:55:54,399 --> 01:55:59,879
anything above that because you'd have

2425
01:55:56,198 --> 01:56:03,000
to get a macro micro license yeah I'm

2426
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:06,078
fine but don't [ __ ] tell me how many

2427
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:08,960
goddamn plants I can have in V you know

2428
01:56:06,078 --> 01:56:10,920
what I mean what's that doing the fact

2429
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:13,719
that somebody has 10 plants instead of

2430
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:15,920
six while they got six in flower is not

2431
01:56:13,719 --> 01:56:18,880
going to influence anybody who isn't

2432
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,760
going to break your law anyway to break

2433
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:22,840
that law they'll just

2434
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:26,000
exactly you're not

2435
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:28,560
creating criminals by letting them have

2436
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:31,000
30 or 40 veg plants while they search

2437
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:36,320
through a match seeds you know what I

2438
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:39,599
mean yeah like this is so small town uh

2439
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:42,319
do it yourself mom and pop restaurants

2440
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:46,360
mom and pop everything that if they

2441
01:56:42,319 --> 01:56:48,319
would let people you know do those CES

2442
01:56:46,359 --> 01:56:51,118
find those fenos

2443
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:55,078
develop the the habits you need the

2444
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:55,960
experience you need to find special cuts

2445
01:56:55,078 --> 01:56:58,479
out of

2446
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:01,000
seeds you know you let the people do

2447
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:04,359
that you're going to organically grow a

2448
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:07,039
nice cannabis seat oh yeah

2449
01:57:04,359 --> 01:57:08,559
rather than the cats who moved from Cal

2450
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:11,158
I'm not talking [ __ ] but there's people

2451
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,920
who moved from California out here to

2452
01:57:11,158 --> 01:57:15,439
New Mexico

2453
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:17,199
absolutely you know even if New Mexico

2454
01:57:15,439 --> 01:57:19,759
did very well to make sure it was New

2455
01:57:17,198 --> 01:57:21,598
Mexico residents getting the licenses a

2456
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:23,000
lot of those licenses got somebody in

2457
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:25,119
the grow room

2458
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:29,439
you know from Cali running the whole

2459
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:31,118
[ __ ] show yep um again no not

2460
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:33,559
disrespecting anybody it's a good

2461
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:37,319
business move on everybody's

2462
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:40,119
part uh but now you're letting those

2463
01:57:37,319 --> 01:57:44,000
people dictate what the local scene

2464
01:57:40,118 --> 01:57:47,319
grows Las Cruz kind of an island on land

2465
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:50,000
you know you got El Paso over a very

2466
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:53,279
unfriendly State

2467
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,039
Line yeah

2468
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:57,639
and then you got a whole lot of desert

2469
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:58,639
for a whole lot of miles a whole lot of

2470
01:57:57,639 --> 01:58:01,679
Indian

2471
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:04,520
reservation and then you got Northern

2472
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:08,158
Mexico a long way away so I really wish

2473
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:11,079
they would do away with the plant count

2474
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:12,319
laws as far as vegetative yeah that

2475
01:58:11,078 --> 01:58:14,198
doesn't really make a lot of sense

2476
01:58:12,319 --> 01:58:17,479
especially considering like you're not

2477
01:58:14,198 --> 01:58:21,118
producing any drug content with the veg

2478
01:58:17,479 --> 01:58:24,078
plants who gives a [ __ ] about the veg

2479
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:26,880
plants grow more than six without a

2480
01:58:24,078 --> 01:58:28,880
license are going to grow more than six

2481
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,400
without a license absolutely yeah right

2482
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:34,400
it's common

2483
01:58:31,399 --> 01:58:36,039
sense so if that was changed I'd be a

2484
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:37,479
happy cat I was going to get a micro

2485
01:58:36,039 --> 01:58:41,439
license one of the things you have to do

2486
01:58:37,479 --> 01:58:43,638
is present them with business plan and I

2487
01:58:41,439 --> 01:58:45,839

2488
01:58:43,639 --> 01:58:48,078

2489

02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:38,839
do appreciate some of the things they're

2534
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:42,799
they're doing here in New Mexico and it

2535
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:43,719
being a a low populated state it allows

2536
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:47,760
them

2537
02:00:43,719 --> 02:00:50,679
to kind of uh push towards Grassroots a

2538
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:53,159
little bit I think it's a good

2539
02:00:50,679 --> 02:00:56,679
thing but I'm sure they still fund the

2540
02:00:53,158 --> 02:00:59,118
pig somehow so [ __ ] uh you know they do

2541
02:00:56,679 --> 02:01:02,039
