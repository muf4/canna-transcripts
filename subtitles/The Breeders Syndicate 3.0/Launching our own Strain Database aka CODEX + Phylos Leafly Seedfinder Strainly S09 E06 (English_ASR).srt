welcome to breeders Syndicate the only

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,880
cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,599
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,160
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,500
cookies

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,238
we're the traditional Market

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,619
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,679
bakers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,280
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,200
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,218
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,219
this is the revolution

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,299
welcome to reader Syndicate I'm Matthew

27
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,439
here with my co-host thousand Fulton

28
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:06,478
today we will be talking about the Codex

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,359
and thousandfold would you like to give

30
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,819
them an introduction on the Codex a

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,019
brief one on what it is and what it

32
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,019
means

33
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,599
yeah sure so I think this episode is

34
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,819
almost an extension of uh the episode

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,118
that we call the name game

36
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:27,658
um on the Cannabis information space and

37
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,359
yeah we are launching our own quote

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,340
unquote strain database

39
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,759
um that we're calling the Codex

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,079
and certainly you know uh we're gonna

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,560
talk about

42
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:45,298
databases out there like phylus Leafly

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,879
seedfinder strain link and how we got to

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,979
the Codex idea ourselves and how we got

45
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,798
to building that yep

46
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,719
um and implicitly like making comparison

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,479
between all these different we databases

48
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,519
and you know what we think

49
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,920
um is good and we think is bad about

50
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,118
each of them and what they contributed

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,680
to

52
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,959
you know a sense of cannabis and

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,520
cannabis history so far

54
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,098
um sounds good

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,780
yeah so I don't know the Codex itself I

56
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,598
think will save most of the details for

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,280
the end yeah but yeah I think all we can

58
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,459
say right now is that this is something

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,620
that I built with the help of Quasi and

60
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,120
anadine from the breed of Syndicate

61
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,159
um of course in consultation with Matt

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,780
the whole time

63
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,340
um and yeah we built it earlier in the

64
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,000
year

65
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,039
um

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,500
so yeah that's really exciting

67
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,179
um yeah and I don't know Matt I think

68
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,039
we'll we'll get back to it more fully

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,439
later is anything you want to say at

70
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,199
this point about the Codex

71
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,878
um I you know uh it's just one of those

72
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,219
things that I felt always needed to be

73
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,859
done you know like correctly and I've

74
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,340
always had this goal in mind of how to

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,440
do it correctly but never a way to do it

76
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,539
correctly and I think there's a big

77
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,060
demand for it I know there are other

78
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,400
things out there that people consider

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,098
efficient only because uh maybe their

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,420
their understanding of cannabis genetics

81
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,219
is different than mine so the

82
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,659
perspective might be different but yeah

83
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,900
that's about where I'll leave for now

84
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:16,620
and we'll jump into it and uh go deeper

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,360
yeah and I think to kind of uh

86
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,739
start the countdown so to speak we're

87
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,080
actually going to go through yet like I

88
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,819
mentioned these these uh quote major

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,180
cannabis databases

90
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:30,119
and uh the first one that we have

91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,739
discussed or sorry I should say met you

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,620
know historically has mentioned a number

93
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,439
of times uh everyone's favorite philos

94
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,140
yes philos

95
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,299
um so this is a tough one because this

96
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,738
is a major corporation

97
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,180
um I remember when I first spoke out

98
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,658
about them

99
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,519
um I I I was concerned because no one

100
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:51,479
had my back at the time

101
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,480
um

102
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,098
it was it was it was a little big it was

103
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,798
a little bit much you know one guy going

104
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,479
against a mega Corp at the time which as

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,000
far as Mega Corps to go they're not that

106
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,859
Mega but for cannabis at the time they

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,818
were making a big splash and they were

108
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,980
back and co-signed by many of of the

109
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,259
most respected like scientists and

110
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:16,259
genetics geneticists and breeders in

111
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:20,399
cannabis they all of them co-signed it

112
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:22,279
so the promise of phylos initially was

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,579
that they could show

114
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,899
variants and breeding data or uh uh you

115
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,359
know trying to think of the best words

116
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:33,659
for it but basically they could tell you

117
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,580
how uniform it will or won't breed and

118
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,080
they tried to say that they could tell

119
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,539
you

120
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,599
or like basically I did was to match you

121
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,919
up with someone across the country who

122
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,139
has equal but opposite genetic variance

123
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,959
to you so you could then combine them

124
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,819
and make this amazing F1 hybrid that was

125
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,560
the initial promise

126
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,360
um and I think that even philos would

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,759
agree that was that was their initial

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,740
statement how they came out and that

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,939
sounded great for me like being able to

130
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,100
understand

131
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,560
um something you know take take the

132
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,000
material and find out how it's going to

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,699
breed without having to breed with it's

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,019
pretty interesting you know uh there

135
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,100
could be clones that are entered that

136
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,899
I'm about to breed with and I can go

137
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,340
look and say oh oh it reads very narrow

138
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,679
so maybe I should match it up with this

139
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,299
as opposed to this poly hybrid or you

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,780
know what have you

141
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,660
um um one one thing Matt here was it the

142
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,538
first kind of public well publicly

143
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,979
accessible project in cannabis that

144
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,240
involved like

145
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,879
I don't know if this is the right term

146
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,759
is it like genomic mapping or some kind

147
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,740
of genetic mapping I don't think so I

148
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,259
think medicinal genomics was before them

149
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,400
and there might have been one before

150
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,800
however okay so it wasn't the first

151
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,939
attempt at this correct

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,280
um

153
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,740
however it was I think the first big

154
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,239
money attempted this and the first time

155
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,918
where all these massive breeders

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,500
co-signed something and immediately went

157
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,019
behind it guys like Rob Clark

158
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,519
um uh my friend Chimera and he spoke

159
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,500
about this since

160
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,959
um you know lots of people co-signed it

161
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,339
and we're all about it you know

162
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,159
um yeah did you talk about this with

163
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,579
Chimera on one of the episodes I may

164
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,380
have I am sure you would have because

165
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:19,079
it's how we butted heads

166
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:22,259
right right okay

167
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,258
so yeah I mean like I said I was very

168
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,120
outspoken about it and when

169
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,680
I finally started having interactions

170
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,840
with them because I you know I had a

171
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,000
certain spidey sense going off because

172
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,739
they were saying they could do also

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,600
after they said this this genetic

174
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,120
testing to see how variant it is they

175
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,300
started saying they could do genetic

176
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,600
testing to see relative data like seeing

177
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:49,319
parental data seeing like s1s to Mother

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,580
data seeing you know uh cousins all

179
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,620
kinds of stuff they were claiming that

180
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,418
if they were in their database they

181
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,939
could prove or disprove genetic relation

182
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,339
and show how they're related which

183
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,918
for any breeder what everyone had been

184
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:05,399
dreaming of it is my dream to have this

185
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:08,038
happen in Canada like absolute dream but

186
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,500
usually when someone

187
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,019
tells me that they are they can present

188
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,120
me with my dream

189
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:18,060
immediately I'm skeptical because that's

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,560
just my instinct like why are you trying

191
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,959
to sell me my dream this sounds almost

192
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,300
this hasn't been done in cannabis that I

193
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,918
know of to this extent and all these

194
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,199
breeders are backing it can I ask you

195
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,879
some questions so they did get back to

196
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,780
me and and to their credit they called

197
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,418
me

198
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:35,579
um they were willing to take questions

199
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:39,000
um I asked the questions like could you

200
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:42,418
tell an S1 from blah blah blah and they

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,500
said yes we can for sure tell an S1 from

202
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:45,240
its mother

203
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,360
um blah blah blah and they offered me

204
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,038
some free testing kits now these were

205
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,919
very expensive at the time so I was like

206
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,560
whoa that's nice of them you know what I

207
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,120
mean like that's nice of them they give

208
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,579
me free testing kits maybe they aren't

209
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,259
so bad you know

210
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,098
um but I had some more questions for

211
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,439
them

212
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,779
and I I don't recall what they were off

213
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,038
offhand I could look at my email and

214
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,959
find them but

215
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:13,318
um I had more questions for them and I

216
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,519
felt like their answer again was super

217
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,819
dodgy

218
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,318
so again I became kind of skeptical I'm

219
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,819
more on the skeptical side because like

220
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,400
now they're giving me gifts they're

221
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,419
promising me the world or my my dream at

222
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,519
least

223
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:29,579
um they're giving me free gifts to so I

224
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,198
can see this genetic relation and

225
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,299
um still no one's being skeptical

226
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,259
anywhere about it

227
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,500
um

228
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:41,158
slowly but surely they had someone pop

229
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,839
out from their company

230
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,519
um that was I want to say VP of

231
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,899
marketing

232
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,240
um I might be incorrect I might be

233
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,399
misspeaking on that but allegedly this

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,919
person was VP of marketing and it was

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
confirmed later by philos

236
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,039
um and she had a lot to say about what

237
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,560
they could and couldn't do

238
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,958
she said that they have artificially and

239
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,479
this is this is her saying this not me

240
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,639
it's alleged that they had artificially

241
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,379
shifted the Galaxy which I I don't know

242
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,120
anything about I couldn't prove it but

243
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,879
that was her claim

244
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,700
um and she said that you know like they

245
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,559
showed preference to Big Spenders which

246
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,660
was interesting

247
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,518
um and you know she said that they don't

248
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,500
do long read testing there which was the

249
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,060
most interesting to me because if they

250
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,440
don't do long read testing it means that

251
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:26,819
they're not getting the full genetic

252
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,060
read

253
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,980
and later on after talking to someone

254
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,719
else as having it explained which I

255
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,060
didn't understand at the time they were

256
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,440
having something called short redone and

257
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,359
when you do short read you're trying to

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
compare short read to short read but

259
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
because of how

260
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,699
the clips work they might not be clipped

261
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,379
at the same spot so you'll never see

262
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,000
that same genetic relation and the

263
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,278
reason they were doing short read is

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,778
because it was cheaper and philos

265
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,939
allegedly

266
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:54,958
we'll have to be so careful was hiring

267
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,740
out

268
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,679
um

269
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,480
a lab to do the testing they were not an

270
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,819
actual lab they were having other people

271
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,100
do the testing so

272
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,080
um again it was it was trying to save

273
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,959
money and

274
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,820
it shortcut their data so hard that they

275
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,619
weren't able to do what they were

276
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,140
claiming allegedly

277
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,778
now

278
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:21,778
how we were able to test it

279
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:21,778
allegedly

280
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,679
um

281
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,019
someone sent in someone that I trust

282
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,000
that's a very good librarian sentence um

283
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:38,039
samples

284
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,320
um two phylos of a parent plant an S1 of

285
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,360
that plant you know and uh and some

286
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,220
other stuff and like hybrids of that

287
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,440
mother plant that they made the s1zza

288
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,600
just to see like how these were coming

289
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,000
back and uh yeah they were coming back

290
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,940
not related at all not even a little bit

291
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,740
like the mother the two parent plants of

292
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,880
one of the hybrids came back is not

293
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,919
being relate and none of them were

294
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,679
related to each other which we knew was

295
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,360
incorrect but because we wanted to be

296
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,659
thorough

297
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,940
we assumed that we had somehow messed up

298
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,980
and started from scratch just to be sure

299
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,360
that we got the right cuts from the

300
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,360
right Mom

301
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,639
sent them in labeled correctly so always

302
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,100
operating on the assumption that we were

303
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,078
incorrect you know and we did this I

304
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,579
think three times total where we went

305
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,559
back and forth with them they're like no

306
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:27,659
our science is perfect blah blah blah

307
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,699
these are obviously not related you must

308
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,078
have made a mistake and was it okay well

309
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,220
we're gonna go ahead and do this redo

310
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:33,419
this again

311
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,278
um we're gonna make sure there's no

312
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:38,419
mistakes and send it in second time same

313
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:41,338
thing third time bam same thing and um

314
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:43,379
unfortunately a week later filo shut

315
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:47,040
down their genetic testing

316
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:49,980
after uh their third response because it

317
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,500
was starting to get serious because

318
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,399
if someone promises they can do

319
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,519
something very loudly as their marketing

320
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,519
as I understand it they need to then

321
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,980
deliver on that science if the science

322
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,399
cannot do what they're claiming it does

323
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,019
and they take money for this service

324
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,759
I think that puts them in a really

325
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,159
awkward position

326
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,720
even a few years later like because

327
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,759
they're still operating as the same

328
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,759
company so

329
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,720
it's always interested me but the

330
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,439
problem is

331
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,139
no one's really able to or speak really

332
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,720
speaks out about this because again

333
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,039
everybody seems like they are scared of

334
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,320
confronting

335
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,159
this Corporation

336
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,260
um

337
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,939
but it doesn't do any good to be quiet

338
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,559
about it because so many people are

339
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:46,079
basing their conclusions on this

340
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,759
allegedly bunk genetic data

341
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,559
um and and the thing that was real weird

342
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,720
was that some stuff lined up pretty well

343
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,939
and that was cool but a lot of stuff

344
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,339
didn't and the problem is with data like

345
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,620
that when you have erroneous data you

346
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,300
cannot use any of it because you cannot

347
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,159
pick and choose what you think might

348
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,299
work by bias and that's what would

349
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,819
happen

350
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:07,259
um so you have to toss it off

351
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,240
I

352
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,519
for me right like just thinking about

353
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,659
the way that you you guys tested them

354
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,539
right

355
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,278
um for me what's Buzzy is that from

356
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,719
their point of view from like a risk

357
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,338
management point of view they should

358
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,879
have known that this was possible and

359
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:27,600
that someone would do this surely so in

360
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm also kind of still bemused about how

361
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,399
this unfolded because I'm like surely

362
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,720
that's such a myopic strategy what they

363
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,458
were doing if they knew what they were

364
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,740
doing fully anyway

365
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:40,439
um I think yeah someone at some point

366
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,799
would do this I think maybe like if I

367
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,380
had a theory if my own Theory I have no

368
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:49,139
basis other than feelings for this

369
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:52,019
Theory so don't you know quote me

370
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,000
allegedly All That Jazz

371
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,159
um sarcastic speculation of the

372
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
speculation all of it

373
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,620
um

374
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I would I would think the higher ups

375
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,740
maybe didn't understand the science and

376
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
were relying on the people doing the

377
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,039
testing and stuff to tell them how it

378
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,200
was going to work and those people

379
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,860
didn't understand fully understand the

380
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,120
Cannabis genome

381
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,220
just like all the other agricultural

382
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,299
people that come into cannabis thought

383
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,519
they were going to take over our

384
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,078
industry with a bunch of phds and then

385
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,399
all failed out and flunked out of

386
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:22,078
cannabis and caused the Cannabis

387
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
collapse so

388
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,699
you know like it's it's not just them

389
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,000
that assumed all cannabis people were

390
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,920
stupid all phds that I know did that

391
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
came into our field not all but like a

392
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,159
good portion of them you know like

393
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,139
enough to make it a good generalization

394
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,838
and be pretty accurate

395
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,060
um to me yeah to me philos out of this

396
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
whole out of this list of databases

397
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,899
we're going to go through is the biggest

398
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,360
bummer for sure you know the other ones

399
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,159
are kind of like you know like uh

400
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,740
they're pros and cons you know some of

401
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,299
them have uh like uh middling in some

402
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,698
way but also they've done certain things

403
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:59,519
that are quite cool this one is just

404
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:04,620
like really really kind of heartbreaking

405
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:07,078
because the promise was so incredible

406
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,320
um but the under delivery was so severe

407
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,519
that like there's just no salvaging it I

408
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,680
feel like

409
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,419
um I also wanted to say that you know we

410
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,859
talked a little bit about you asked me a

411
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,679
little bit about my personal journey

412
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,539
into the information space yes uh on the

413
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,939
name game episode and actually

414
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:25,860
completely forgotten that um

415
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,459
uh these websites were really important

416
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,459
for me too and the the filers Galaxy

417
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:35,539
when I first saw it I was just like oh

418
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:38,219
my God that's the coolest thing ever

419
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:40,139
and I couldn't believe it

420
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,759
and uh

421
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,220
come to find of course that I shouldn't

422
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,559
have believed it as well yeah um it was

423
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,240
because what you could see I'll just say

424
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,799
this you know the the Galaxy I don't

425
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,039
know for people who haven't encountered

426
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,620
it the Galaxy is this uh visualization

427
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,539
of supposed

428
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,698
relationships between all these various

429
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,919
plants in the database

430
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:04,379
um it's like a graph uh where you call a

431
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,578
graph not not like a chart but like a

432
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:11,698
network graph of nodes and links and um

433
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,439
why I didn't want to highlight this is

434
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:17,219
because I did take some inspiration from

435
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,180
that uh for our codex uh even though uh

436
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,680
you know

437
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:21,419
um I was still very much a work in

438
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,759
progress

439
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:26,099
um there was something about that visual

440
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,379
model that I wanted to

441
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,399
uh capture

442
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,419
um

443
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:36,720
and yeah it was just you know

444
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,219
if philos actually delivered

445
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,540
I think

446
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,920
who knows what the downstream

447
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,360
consequences would have been if they had

448
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,919
actually done what they said they would

449
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,539
do

450
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,399
um but yeah

451
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,620
yeah it was it was a place that I liked

452
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,559
going to for a while

453
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,320
yeah it it's just one of the other

454
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,419
problems is that so many breeders like

455
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,100
serious breeders

456
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:00,659
um have taken this data and I find

457
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,159
myself doing it because just like

458
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,558
everyone else even though I was really

459
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,019
skeptical I was digging through the

460
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,578
Galaxy because I was still so interested

461
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,980
right like is the data's still there

462
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,779
like it could be real

463
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,578
I was so

464
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,859
interested in it because this is

465
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,539
everything I want it answers all the

466
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,178
potentially answered all the questions

467
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,379
that I had about my passion you know

468
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,780
what I mean

469
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,819
um so a lot of us made conclusions based

470
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:29,399
on this data and spoke very

471
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:32,940
matter-of-factly because the science was

472
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,980
telling us this right and even though we

473
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,200
currently understand now

474
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,120
or at least from our perspective that

475
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
it's not reliable

476
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,599
um

477
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,220
I still find myself having to go back

478
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,659
and being like Oh wait that's not the

479
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,940
parent to that why do I still think that

480
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,640
I know that that's not correct that it

481
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,500
happens daily absolutely daily

482
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
um I'll be in conversations with other

483
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,740
breeders and we'll be talking and we'll

484
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,660
both know that this is [ __ ] and

485
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,519
we'll still make like be like well you

486
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,660
know philos did say and then we'll catch

487
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,500
ourselves be like

488
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,960
oh and it really happens that's how

489
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,900
That's How Deeply we trusted the science

490
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,360
and how much I as a man I consider

491
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,240
myself a man of science how much I

492
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,639
normally trust science right

493
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,339
yeah when I when I found it I was like

494
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,320
oh finally finally I found it kind of

495
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,759
vibe yeah

496
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,980
um and I'll say this other thing about

497
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,259
the Galaxy that I I was personally

498
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,700
really interested in

499
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:32,519
um

500
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,140
I think the claim was that

501
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,298
you know we had that episode on bass

502
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,880
lines right the one of the claims was

503
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:41,879
that the Galaxy visualization would help

504
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,160
you actually like identify what the

505
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,380
polls the different the multiple polls

506
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,360
in the gene pool War right so like oh

507
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,059
northern lights over there there's like

508
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,619
OG over here and there's train wreck all

509
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:56,099
the way out there and

510
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:57,959
again such a dream if it were real if it

511
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:02,219
you know if it actually corresponded

512
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,179
with the real thing but yeah before one

513
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,519
of the things that made me super

514
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,259
skeptical too was as they started adding

515
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,720
to philos they started adding these

516
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:12,240
weird categories that meant nothing they

517
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,179
had like blueberry as a category they

518
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,419
had or no they had blueberry inside hemp

519
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,700
hemp was a category OG Kush was a

520
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,220
category Hayes was a cat like it was

521
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,600
just weird [ __ ] that like this is a

522
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,620
whole category and there were several

523
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,899
other that

524
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,519
were kind of weird and then you were

525
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,880
dropped into these categories and they

526
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,160
never really it's just I don't know came

527
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,320
up with this idea that these felony I

528
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,400
know who it was determined it who it was

529
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,740
the same person who came up with the

530
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,860
emerald cup categories yeah sweets and

531
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,440
dreams bro

532
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:47,719
they got the same guy yeah that's it's

533
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,298
just like

534
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,980
who is quantifying this is OG Kush I'd

535
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:54,720
really like to talk to them can we can

536
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,460
we have this discussion who who made

537
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,100
this decision and why is this the

538
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,140
scientific conclusion that blueberry is

539
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,000
hemp all of a sudden you know like that

540
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,679
it was it was very confusing but that

541
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,900
was just there were so many things like

542
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,640
that that constantly popped up with them

543
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,519
um certain relations they were showing

544
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,080
that breeding

545
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,599
showed completely different to me like

546
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:19,038
the fact that they they had Urkel not

547
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,038
being related to cookies at all

548
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,960
oh gee cush not related to cookies

549
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,019
and it was just like uh

550
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,720
Thai a Thai land race

551
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:34,200
as OG Kush clone

552
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,480
just by Rob Clark no less which I you

553
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,640
know I I love Ron Clark that's that's

554
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,679
one of my heroes of cannabis but it was

555
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,538
all so confusing and I didn't understand

556
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,820
what was going on with the data and but

557
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,700
it was a lot of a lot of things that

558
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,619
weren't quite conclusive

559
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,019
contradicting each other I don't know

560
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:55,319
that's that's the best way to put it

561
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,660
yeah yeah oh I did want to just also

562
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,779
point out here for everyone that

563
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,660
um unfortunately uh you know in in the

564
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:05,819
past episodes we've tried like sharing

565
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,380
uh Matt's screen and going through the

566
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:09,298
web pages and all that but you know

567
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,760
unfortunately YouTube doesn't like that

568
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:14,339
at all so we can't do that it would have

569
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,460
been a great episode to do that on but

570
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:19,379
sadly yeah kind of um if you want to if

571
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,880
you feel like it pull these websites up

572
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,140
as we're talking about them and have a

573
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
look yourself

574
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,520
it's kind of stifled the reviews too for

575
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,500
future reviews and all kinds of stuff

576
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,359
now so you will have to figure some

577
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,179
stuff out but we will

578
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,000
we will yeah anything else about phylus

579
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,679
before we move um just that it's it's

580
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,720
again like I'd say the number two

581
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,640
uh cannabis dirty secret other than the

582
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,038
bait and switch like it's it's it's up

583
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,360
there as being like the dirty secret a

584
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,579
lot of us know about but like

585
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,199
everybody's terrified to talk about for

586
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:53,579
whatever reason because people get mad

587
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,400
because so many people have based

588
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:58,558
conclusions on this blah blah blah wait

589
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,538
they're a corporation question from me

590
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,119
is the website still there can people

591
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:04,200
actually still go and see it I don't

592
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,959
know

593
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,360
okay I do know they stopped uh after

594
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,759
that a literal week and I don't know

595
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,719
maybe it was no correlation at all I'm

596
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,900
sure they're going to say there was no

597
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,640
correlation to it but a week after me

598
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,980
and this other person that's taken very

599
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,140
seriously in our community confronted

600
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,659
them about the results

601
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,520
um they said uh no longer doing genetic

602
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,100
testing shutting down going into

603
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:33,179
autoflowering blah blah blah

604
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:34,980
see ya and that was it you know

605
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,480
um yeah it was weird it was it was super

606
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,460
weird and the timing was super it's

607
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,980
interesting yeah I just looked at it the

608
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,240
website is still there but like

609
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,519
it's quite different now and

610
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,980
yeah the the whole 3D Galaxy thing is

611
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,279
gone so they've yeah they've kind of

612
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,440
like yeah got to do it

613
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,418
and that's weird right like think about

614
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,220
all the money that went into that

615
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,220
developing it why would they take that

616
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,720
down ever

617
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,860
why would they do that like really think

618
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,860
about that if that's yeah

619
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,919
yeah I'll say this money-wise yeah

620
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,298
there's not a small amount of money like

621
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,460
the people who did the web development

622
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:19,440
for that that were not being cheap there

623
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:21,240
no and the other thing is like

624
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,798
you know like didn't people pay for this

625
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,579
data

626
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:28,139
like what the what the hell like if they

627
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,158
paid for it to be up there it's gone

628
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,840
like

629
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,640
that's interesting but I mean I guess

630
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,199
they did tell everyone to to download

631
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,880
your data because you're getting rid of

632
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,960
it and I figured I figured at that point

633
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,179
oh they're getting rid of it because

634
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,179
they don't want to get sued uh allegedly

635
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,859
allegedly

636
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,179
uh we satire did you want to gesture

637
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,579
towards I don't I don't think you

638
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,679
mentioned this uh wasn't there also a

639
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,960
controversy around how they were going

640
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,419
to use it or like rumors about how they

641
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,460
were going to use it yeah that's right

642
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:03,659
um so that that's what I like called the

643
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:06,140
swerve with them was that like they kept

644
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:09,360
acting like they were being

645
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:11,220
inappropriately attacked by people and

646
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,779
some people were like going public and

647
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,480
saying hey they're going to get your

648
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,399
genetic data and rebuild that clone from

649
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,558
nothing they really thought that they

650
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,780
could take like genetic data and like

651
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:24,000
plug it into a

652
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:24,960
I don't know tissue or a cell and regrow

653
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,839
their

654
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,460
clone from that genetic data which isn't

655
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,399
even possible

656
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,720
I don't know like no I don't think so I

657
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,220
don't think anybody with any scientific

658
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,620
understanding was accusing them of this

659
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,360
but they were just like you'd see them

660
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:40,798
just raging back anytime they were on

661
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,599
any kind of podcast talking about yeah

662
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,460
we would never steal genetic data

663
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,918
because we can't do that blah blah blah

664
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,798
but like when I was going after them and

665
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,960
I and having real questions for them and

666
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,240
uh and talking about what they just were

667
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,440
saying and doing that was contradicting

668
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,240
just what on that but yeah we would

669
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,980
never you know rebuild from this it's

670
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,900
like nobody's saying that no like nobody

671
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,120
important nobody nobody's seriously

672
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,400
saying that but we are saying some other

673
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,439
stuff why won't you address this and

674
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,419
yeah

675
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,220
I don't know like the people behind

676
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,259
philos were super nice and that sucks

677
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,640
because like I could have had a nice

678
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:20,700
friendship with some of them I imagine

679
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,919
in another life you know had it not been

680
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,380
something where something I'm so

681
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,740
passionate about was so played with by

682
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,440
what I considered maybe allegedly

683
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,120
cultural vultures you know

684
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,259
yeah

685
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:39,000
um if any of you by the way have had uh

686
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:41,038
experiences with philos definitely tell

687
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,038
us about it in the comments comment

688
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,200
below if you ever had your stuff tested

689
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:48,599
by philos and let us know what your

690
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,120
feelings are do you think it was real do

691
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:54,178
you do you trust their data and why

692
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,219
um yeah I'm interested yeah yeah even or

693
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,700
even if you're like me just like a you

694
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,400
know armchair whatever theorist uh you

695
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,500
know tell us how you feel about you know

696
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,120
what eventuated yeah I'm super

697
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,819
interested to see the comments on this

698
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,219
one super interesting

699
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:14,339
yeah I mean otherwise we can move on to

700
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,480
Leafly if you're already mad yeah Leafly

701
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,500
[ __ ]

702
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,079
um I don't even remember when they

703
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,579
popped up but like they were probably

704
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,099
one of

705
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,658
one of the biggest I think out of all

706
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,459
these sites other than in philos which

707
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:30,059
is like a mega Corporation but as far as

708
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,860
like advertising marketing money spent

709
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:33,119
on stuff like that I'd say they were a

710
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,278
much bigger website and probably

711
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,399
generated a lot more Revenue overall

712
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:41,159
than philos uh for other companies and

713
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,880
themselves I could imagine

714
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:47,460
um they were kind of like a strained

715
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,919
database where they listed

716
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,579
what they felt were popular strain names

717
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:57,299
and they would give you

718
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:59,278
blanket like generic data about like how

719
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:02,278
much percent indica and how much percent

720
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,500
sativa or if it was all indica or all

721
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:06,480
sativa you know most most of the time it

722
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,359
would just say Indica sativa or hybrid

723
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,038
you know and that's right yeah it would

724
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,038
tell you like oh this helps with your

725
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,500
anxiety and pain blah blah blah we give

726
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:17,819
it a score of 6.4 out of nine you know

727
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,339
what I mean like it was stuff like that

728
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,599
and it was real goofy yeah yeah I don't

729
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,819
know where they got the data like

730
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,939
there's like I agreed with very little

731
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:31,200
on the site ever and I remember uh there

732
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,900
was a a funny picture of AJ from um sour

733
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,600
fam and he had a pillow that strangely

734
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,778
or I'm sorry Leafly had sent him he had

735
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:42,240
a pillow Leafly it sent him that said uh

736
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:44,220
Sour Diesel and had like the S and then

737
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,659
it had I in the corner for Indica he's

738
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,159
like sour or something

739
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,659
you know like I just remember that

740
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,580
really distinctly and kind of just

741
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,580
sniffing a little bit funny yeah

742
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,819
um okay I do want to add a couple of

743
00:27:54,298 --> 00:28:00,058
things so I believe a lot of the

744
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:03,918
information is crowdsourced so like no

745
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:08,278
okay I think that the like effects

746
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,100
section and the smell and flavor section

747
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:13,558
uh what they do is like

748
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:17,038
uh I think anyone can fill out like a

749
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:19,079
survey and then they aggregate uh This

750
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,119
Crowd Source information

751
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,678
and present like the aggregated results

752
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,918
like the top you know like the top

753
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,840
scoring things uh from their reviews

754
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,940
um on the one hand it's kind of an

755
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,980
interesting concept because

756
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,340
as we know these things are very

757
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,460
subjective and so okay like uh being

758
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:40,199
charitable I can see why one would think

759
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,360
that's cool we'll just survey lots of

760
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,038
people and the more people uh

761
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:45,479
the more information we get then the

762
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,640
better our information is which yeah

763
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,038
sort of makes sense in a broad in a

764
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,600
broad way real quick real quick let me

765
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,000
interject this is also something that

766
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,139
philos had done

767
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
when they were talking about their

768
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,759
legacy clones and it was one of my main

769
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,159
questions that I was asking like

770
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,619
how are you determining your legacy

771
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,380
clones like how does that work and and

772
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,199
they were crowdsourcing I mean as I

773
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,940
understand it they were crowdsourcing

774
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,159
and if they got a bunch of people

775
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,980
entering the same cut as chem D for

776
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,720
example that's Legacy chemd that's the

777
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,700
real one original because so many people

778
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,159
had it must be real and we know that

779
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,798
this is like a in cannabis this is a big

780
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,559
No-No because a lot of times the most

781
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,839
passed cut is the the fake one you know

782
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,298
like you just that uncirculated one

783
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:35,639
stays here and another one goes out it's

784
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:37,740
the masses for twenty dollars a clone at

785
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,000
a local dispensary anyway wanted to add

786
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,220
that part yeah

787
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,859
yeah for sure and

788
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,440
again like you know uh like I was saying

789
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:48,898
broadly speaking from a high level it

790
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,580
looks like a somewhat sound strategy for

791
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:52,139
the subjective you know getting some

792
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,720
subjective information in a more

793
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,360
objective fashion sure but when you

794
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,940
consider the idea that like

795
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,158
the people who are writing reviews of

796
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,679
quote-unquote OG Kush and the likelihood

797
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,679
of them actually having the same

798
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,320
you know the actual same cut or the same

799
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,580
flower sample is so low that ultimately

800
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,079
you don't really know what they're

801
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,699
talking about like you have no idea

802
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,038
whether they're actually all talking

803
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,778
about the same thing or not yeah

804
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,839
um exactly the other thing I would say

805
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:23,759
about go ahead no no no go ahead I was

806
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,798
gonna say that one of the major I think

807
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,619
differentiating factors with Leafly as

808
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:32,519
well I think out of all of these it's

809
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:35,519
the most mainstream one I think and it's

810
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,519
more targeted at like end consumers I

811
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,200
think yeah and people Midway at the

812
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,298
chain you know or whatever

813
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,399
um yeah no Growers that's the other

814
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:47,579
thing yeah yeah

815
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:50,579
yeah I don't know many Growers who like

816
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:53,759
even the people who are brand new knew

817
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:55,379
this that that Leafly was silly like

818
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,879
that that's just you know what I mean

819
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,220
like if you're a grower you already know

820
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,720
that that's incorrect just by

821
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,798
happenstance

822
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,659
I always thought that was really

823
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,940
interesting

824
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,799
yeah the the other thing that's worth

825
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,320
pointing out as well is that they do

826
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:14,278
have lineage information

827
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:16,798
um and I'll tell you something funny

828
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,619
I have a really really good memory of

829
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,259
going there years ago now

830
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:24,538
um and seeing that I'm I'm pretty sure

831
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:27,119
and I'm pretty sure that they're OG Kush

832
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:29,940
was still following that like what is it

833
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,519
Lemon Thai Pakistan yes

834
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,159
yeah but I did look at it last night and

835
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,179
they had improved like some of the

836
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,399
entries

837
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:40,559
like I remember like they they had some

838
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,000
fake stuff for chem dog as well that

839
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,859
they'd made up and now it's all gone and

840
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,960
they just say it's like dog bird unknown

841
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:48,418
so they've it looks like they've made

842
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,579
some effort to clean some things up good

843
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,020
for them

844
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,000
good for them because have you had

845
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,859
you've had some interactions with them

846
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,839
have you Matt um no they're the ones

847
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:00,079
that I've had like zero interaction okay

848
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,079
yeah

849
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,919
um what else were they gonna say about

850
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,200
these guys

851
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,600
um I remember them being involved with

852
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,860
the Seth Rogen goofy [ __ ] when he popped

853
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,418
up with that

854
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:21,658
allegedly houseplant satire crap and uh

855
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,980
was doing his Kim dawg the sativa Kim

856
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:27,899
dog

857
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:31,319
his houseplant sativa named Kim dawg hey

858
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:32,579
I I I did want to pull on one thread

859
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,460
which is something you mentioned in the

860
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:37,798
name game episode which is like the

861
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,899
possible risks in saying that this

862
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,398
quote-unquote strain and again like you

863
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:43,500
know they don't distinguish is this like

864
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:44,939
oh no that could be wrong I think they

865
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,380
do say whether it's a clone or like a

866
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,140
line but

867
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,720
the danger in them saying hey this

868
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,299
strain is has these effects and it's

869
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,339
like somehow really reducible to these

870
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:58,980
and like it's easy to quantify them like

871
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:00,119
this and that you mentioned you know one

872
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,620
of your questions In The Name Game

873
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,538
episode was like

874
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:07,079
can we really call these systems like

875
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:09,179
proper formal medical assistants yes and

876
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,278
the problem with Leafly is that they

877
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:13,440
really make it look like that yeah

878
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,058
that's dangerous bro to me that's

879
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,100
dangerous I think it's dangerous I think

880
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:20,940
it's like like

881
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:24,119
in another world that's probably pretty

882
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,919
like would be legal grounds too like

883
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,178
it's scary and I don't think they want

884
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,320
to be in that position I don't think

885
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,700
they intend to be in that position I

886
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,579
think they're trying to help but like

887
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,860
they just don't understand what the

888
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:36,359
thing that they are talking about they

889
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:39,418
don't understand the thing that they are

890
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,639
the professing to be the all-knowing

891
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,320
narrators of being what they are and how

892
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,880
they present themselves they don't even

893
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,099
understand the basics of it if they

894
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,480
can't if they're telling you how this is

895
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:50,099
going to affect you

896
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,079
you know the strain that you got at the

897
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:55,139
collective name this is gonna affect you

898
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,859
this way like what though [ __ ] no way

899
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:02,519
yeah yeah yeah I mean

900
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:04,678
on the on on like a how would I put it

901
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,620
on like a more positive note one thing

902
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,418
that it does show me if nothing else

903
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:11,819
is how many people still actually do

904
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:14,279
care about this information

905
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,619
um yeah that's so low so that's a nice

906
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,899
thing like people are some people are

907
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,519
buying stuff and wanting to know more

908
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:24,059
and that's cool even if you're the

909
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:26,699
smokers you know yeah um so it does it

910
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:32,358
does gesture towards something I hope

911
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:34,559
bitter uh but yeah yeah it is what it is

912
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,480
it is

913
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,440
I don't know if there's was there

914
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,679
anything else about Leafly yeah they're

915
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,440
just so satire [ __ ] goofy that like

916
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,039
it's one of those ones where I I wish

917
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,220
again like I wish shows like this would

918
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:55,019
capture the interest of the end user but

919
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,638
I'm not sure there will ever be a case

920
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:59,940
where that many people are that

921
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,980
interested in what they're smoking and

922
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,019
why it could potentially be affecting

923
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,400
them the way they are maybe you know

924
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,019
like I just don't see it most people

925
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,760
just are like I don't care what it is

926
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:10,739
just put it in the boat give it to me

927
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,200
you know I think that's typically how it

928
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:15,479
goes

929
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,399
I think Hmm how'd I put it

930
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,539
I think there will be some percentage of

931
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,539
the population that

932
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:28,379
at least wants some differentiating like

933
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,720
information you know to be able to at

934
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,539
least help make the decision uh I I I

935
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,159
like to hope that this feels like a oops

936
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,440
that there's still like a significant

937
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,440
number of people who do care to a degree

938
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,059
yeah I hope so but it's just you know

939
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,159
actually I take you know what I will say

940
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:47,039
I've been very surprised with the past

941
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,960
year just within the past year how many

942
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,019
people have showed up and seemed to

943
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,820
deeply deeply care about that and uh

944
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:55,679
that that's been surprising because I've

945
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,720
never really seen it be more than 20 in

946
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,159
my life at a time and it's you know even

947
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,078
with the forums and stuff there are

948
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,480
people that like acted like they were

949
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,920
super serious about it but like when you

950
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,780
would get into serious discussions with

951
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,639
them about why something is or isn't

952
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,859
like in the series strange discussions

953
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,739
if you went against anything that they

954
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:16,078
believed it was like hell no bro [ __ ]

955
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:18,419
you you know what I mean so nobody was

956
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,099
really I don't know it was always a

957
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,019
really small group of people that were

958
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:25,140
trying to like destroy their own bias

959
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:29,219
too confront their own biases

960
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:32,098
I think I could frame that in a way okay

961
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:35,399
I think how I see that is that

962
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:38,099
people will make some minimal effort to

963
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,660
find out something yeah

964
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,660
um with the information is good or not

965
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:43,858
it's probably beyond their effort and if

966
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,618
you tell them that it's not good

967
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:48,539
information a lot of people just don't

968
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,480
want to expend any more energy they just

969
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:53,159
want to have just want to like

970
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,539
um cozy up with the idea that they

971
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,399
originally had that they were happy with

972
00:36:54,539 --> 00:37:01,759
and they don't want you to like ruin

973
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:05,519
their [ __ ] yeah that's accurate

974
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,000
uh okay well if there's nothing else on

975
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:11,699
Leafly we can move on to one that you

976
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,059
know I still feel

977
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:17,719
quite sentimental about which is

978
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,719
seedfinder.eu yeah

979
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,300
um what do you want me to start with

980
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,659
them

981
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,400
uh maybe just a general like a very

982
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,279
broad description of like what kind of

983
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,400
information you can find there

984
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,280
um so seedfinder is one of the more I

985
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,420
think serious attempts at trying to

986
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,000
capture

987
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,760
uh genetic data presented from the

988
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,858
breeder side as more of a database

989
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,300
like it's more of a database for seed

990
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:47,098
buyers and breeders people who are

991
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,440
deeply interested in seeds

992
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:52,380
and when it started that's mainly what

993
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,559
it was it wasn't a big advertisement it

994
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,700
wasn't a big money maker and

995
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,559
um yeah

996
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:00,838
it's cool oh

997
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,099
that's actually sorry that that's maybe

998
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,279
something we should make a bit more

999
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:09,119
explicit about Leafly as well one of the

1000
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,519
driving incentives is definitely like uh

1001
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,300
cross marketing yes that's a big big

1002
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,039
thing sure yeah so next to your your uh

1003
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,320
on your like flower you know your your

1004
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,358
plant strain entry they're going to be

1005
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,820
like I imagine like dispensaries where

1006
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,619
you can get this yes you know blah blah

1007
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,680
see companies where you can get this

1008
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:29,579
yeah so seat finder yeah like Matt was

1009
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:33,659
saying

1010
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:36,839
seemed mostly to be about lineage

1011
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:38,719
um they do have like a a lot of them do

1012
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,099
have these like quite long form

1013
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,500
descriptions which are pretty cool uh

1014
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,420
you know accuracy aside

1015
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,119
um they do have little sections on

1016
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,700
effects as well I believe but it doesn't

1017
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,338
seem like it's much of the focus yeah

1018
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:56,098
like Matt was saying seems to mostly be

1019
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:58,078
about lineage and then some maybe some

1020
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:00,000
growing some breeding information I

1021
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,260
can't remember for a while they were

1022
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,179
integrating like Forum data and pictures

1023
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,680
and stuff like that so this is really

1024
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:09,419
helpful for a while

1025
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,118
um as far as like yeah

1026
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,099
the best you could get and and for a

1027
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,260
long time I mean it's still the best you

1028
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,240
can get you know like it's one of the

1029
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,280
best for for doing it

1030
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,659
um regardless of accuracy what they put

1031
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,519
together was special

1032
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,739
for sure yeah

1033
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,500
um and just to make the point as well I

1034
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:31,799
think it was also partly crowdsourced or

1035
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,358
semi at least semi crowdsourced so um

1036
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,940
when it started

1037
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,639
they contacted me directly and they and

1038
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,880
they asked me if I would add my strains

1039
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:43,618
to their site and I told them I'm sorry

1040
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,240
and they were such a small site I didn't

1041
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,460
know what was going on with them at the

1042
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,078
time frankly and I wasn't going to put a

1043
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,079
lot of time into someone else's website

1044
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,280
so I was trying to run my forum and ship

1045
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,579
you know and

1046
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,700
grow and take Cuts yeah all that stuff

1047
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:02,339
so I wasn't really into that but they

1048
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:05,699
were kind enough to add a lot of my

1049
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:09,119
strains for me and import a lot of the

1050
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:13,139
um the pictures and descriptions and

1051
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:16,140
stuff like that so like I have a very

1052
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:17,400
very like soft spot spot my heart for

1053
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:20,338
them because they were very kind to do

1054
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,500
that they took the time to do that and

1055
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:24,719
um they did it pretty I mean fairly

1056
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,000
something's wrong but like you're gonna

1057
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,639
get a lot wrong when there's like 200

1058
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,440
things to add so like I I don't fault

1059
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:32,759
them for a lot of bad stuff and they got

1060
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,480
along with mine and they were they're

1061
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,480
very kind to people

1062
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,358
yeah it definitely struck me as like a

1063
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,460
fairly or you know relatively Earnest

1064
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,059
project

1065
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,179
um

1066
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:51,000
and I think there's still a real charm

1067
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:53,879
about going to it because it looks so

1068
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,900
like 90s I don't know it looks like it

1069
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,358
definitely looks like it's from The

1070
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,400
Forum era like there's no doubt

1071
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,559
yeah I don't know if it's like done out

1072
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,720
of Spain or something it has a lot of

1073
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,519
like Spanish and central European

1074
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,739
um seed banks linked to it and like

1075
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,858
advertised all over it

1076
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,659
yeah yeah but I I don't know some of the

1077
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:14,759
some of those banks are kind of Shifty

1078
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:17,159
too so it's kind of weird

1079
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,140
it's definitely a bit of a time capsule

1080
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,659
um I went on to it last night again as

1081
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:25,019
well and it looks exactly the same I

1082
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:27,299
don't expect it to change ever ever

1083
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:29,039
um but again I think I did also do

1084
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,060
another comparison like I did on Leafly

1085
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,579
where I was like oh yeah I remember

1086
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:34,019
looking at this information here and it

1087
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,300
was quite wrong I couldn't even tell you

1088
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:37,800
what it was maybe it was like cookies or

1089
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,359
something maybe it was like gelato or

1090
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,880
just one of those

1091
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,639
and I think that they had improved it as

1092
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,440
well so what's interesting is that

1093
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,779
somehow people are still running it and

1094
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,480
that's kind of cool yeah

1095
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,680
because these things quite a lot of work

1096
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,320
to maintain

1097
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,779
uh my last interaction with them

1098
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,579
was several years ago and I I was

1099
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,880
reaching out to them because

1100
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:05,460
I had had a wild idea of doing a private

1101
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,960
genetic database for myself because I

1102
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,240
was going through their stuff and I was

1103
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,039
realizing oh my God this has gotten so

1104
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,279
crazy for what people have put in here

1105
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,539
that they've made that they've created

1106
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,820
what names they've attributed to

1107
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:20,460
themselves what clones they've claimed

1108
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:24,059
to use and it had gotten so crazy so I

1109
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:28,079
wanted to buy their software

1110
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:29,639
to use privately and like sign ndas or

1111
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,680
whatever I needed to do

1112
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:34,559
to get them to sell it to me just to be

1113
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,838
able to use it for myself for myself and

1114
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,219
to show friends like hey here it is like

1115
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,500
and I'm the only one that can add to it

1116
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:41,879
but uh never got a response and I

1117
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,800
understand that because this is this

1118
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,200
might be their you know livelihood so

1119
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,599
why would they do that this is a a very

1120
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:50,219
highly developed program site so yeah

1121
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,480
that was that was the last time I tried

1122
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,480
to talk to them

1123
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,358
but um yeah props to them either way

1124
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,500
like I wasn't salty about it I I if I

1125
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,440
were in their shoes I probably would

1126
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,739
have ignored it too to be honest yeah

1127
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,260
yeah I I should say as well definitely a

1128
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:08,399
lot of kudos to them

1129
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,260
um

1130
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,900
you know like any approach has

1131
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:16,920
trade-offs you know even hours will

1132
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,780
um and yeah for them you know they were

1133
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,818
able to get a lot of data a lot of it's

1134
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,460
probably quite good data

1135
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:25,440
um but I imagine you know the drawback

1136
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,179
of any kind of crowdsourcing

1137
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,700
Endeavor is

1138
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:31,379
it's hard to

1139
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:33,899
say that everything's been you know

1140
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,240
vetted in the same way that everything's

1141
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,400
as reliable as everything else

1142
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,779
um exactly it's just just one of the

1143
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,119
trade-offs really

1144
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,000
um it is a very cool

1145
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,280
when you do it that way literally people

1146
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,318
were pretending to have seed companies

1147
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,079
that never existed pretended to make

1148
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:54,119
seeds that were never made and made up a

1149
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,880
fake backstory that they could come back

1150
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,680
check you know years later yeah and

1151
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,539
start companies oh yeah I made this back

1152
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,639
then look at my entry on seed fight like

1153
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,980
like [ __ ] you wouldn't even believe or

1154
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,598
even think to you you know but yeah

1155
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,619
that's the kind of stuff that comes from

1156
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,380
that

1157
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:12,358
yeah and and again I'm sure like they

1158
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,980
would have tried you know

1159
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,078
um but when

1160
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,579
when it's set up like that and when that

1161
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,960
is the strategy there's there's

1162
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:20,880
definitely a limit how much you can go

1163
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,679
and vet like there's so much data on

1164
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,900
there there's just no way someone could

1165
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:29,338
go and come through all of it um

1166
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:30,720
and verify all of it so yeah yeah yeah

1167
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:34,380
um the other thing I'll point out that I

1168
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:37,799
liked uh from like a

1169
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,358
uh information representation standpoint

1170
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,700
um they did have quite a neat way of

1171
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:45,239
setting out lineage uh to a degree yeah

1172
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:47,639
no the visual presentation of it's great

1173
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,979
yeah it was great uh the only thing is

1174
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:53,098
that um

1175
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,980
I think that their format did preclude

1176
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:57,420
like more complex families or like you

1177
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,800
know representing more complex families

1178
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:04,380
well because it's like a

1179
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,359
uh so I would it's like a tree structure

1180
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,220
um yes but some families are weirder

1181
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:11,159
than that how could they ever have

1182
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:13,199
imagined freaking uh what's it called

1183
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:14,639
wedding cake how could they ever imagine

1184
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,098
that like you if you go look at the

1185
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:21,059
genetics for this this plant it's like

1186
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,800
nine pages long of just like a tree of

1187
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:24,900
the cookies crossed back to cookies to

1188
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,599
cookies to cookies to cookies to cookies

1189
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,900
it's just it's too it's wild man some

1190
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,700
blue power in there yeah it is

1191
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,099
but yeah I definitely have like fond

1192
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:37,318
memories of spending you know many many

1193
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,920
an hour on the website

1194
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,579
um

1195
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,579

1204
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,699
seedfinder

1205
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:07,439
no just that it was you know it's it's

1206
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,939
what most people consider the best

1207
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,318
attempt so far

1208
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,460
yeah shout out yep respect respect

1209
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:17,039
um

1210
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,720
strain Lee so I'll say this map before

1211
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,119
you get into it like I didn't know much

1212
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,159
about this one because

1213
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,680
um it's more of a Marketplace and and

1214
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:28,139
any kind of marketplace always has a

1215
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,759
serious bias towards North America so I

1216
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:31,139
was just like it's not really for me but

1217
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,839
I did go and look at it for the first

1218
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:35,159
time like really in any depth like uh

1219
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,719
last night

1220
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,098
um but yeah before this I didn't really

1221
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:39,959
know what it was I'm interested to hear

1222
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,380
your take on it bro

1223
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,619
I didn't look too deep uh I I was like

1224
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,480
okay they're trying to be like the eBay

1225
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,740
of cannabis like they do auctions right

1226
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,460
and like

1227
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:53,159
um

1228
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,440
they do grow gear they do seeds they do

1229
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:56,818
clones

1230
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,220
um

1231
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:02,159
yeah so pretty pretty comprehensive in

1232
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:04,199
terms of like stuff that you can get but

1233
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,818
also kind of like the other websites

1234
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,639
really quite overwhelming like you get

1235
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:09,779
lots and lots and lots of Brands

1236
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,059
um

1237
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,480
uh seems like almost anyone quote

1238
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:18,779
unquote can have stuff on there so

1239
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,119
uh maybe a little bit like okay how do I

1240
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,940
tell like who's legit and who's not yes

1241
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,858
in terms of the target market

1242
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,338
it's definitely not as mainstream as

1243
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:31,500
Leafly uh but

1244
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:33,179
yeah so it's more about Growers and

1245
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,358
breeders than

1246
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:39,539
like yeah smokers whatever

1247
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:42,119
um oh they also sell pollen I noticed oh

1248
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:44,279
wow that's a new one yeah

1249
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,900
yeah so that that's what I found just

1250
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,839
you know having a look a quick look at

1251
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,858
it what what can you tell us Matt about

1252
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,338
it

1253
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:55,279
so like out of all these people I have

1254
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:58,318
the most interaction with these dudes

1255
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,940
and it's I can't even say

1256
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:04,980
like there are things that I found

1257
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,500
that about their site from from the jump

1258
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,358
like they contacted me asked me if I'd

1259
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,400
sell on their site and I was like I

1260
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,139
don't know bro this looks kind of shady

1261
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,318
I don't know you they've had a lot of

1262
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:17,699
bad experience by this point and uh they

1263
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:19,500
sent me a thing and it asked for my

1264
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:23,639
social security number and I was like

1265
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:25,139
guys like who are you and they then you

1266
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:27,900
know they told me who they were and more

1267
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:30,118
about them and I understood why what was

1268
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,220
going on and they're not bad dudes there

1269
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:34,740
are a couple of really nice programmer

1270
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:37,500
guys like this is their side job they do

1271
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:39,539
this as their hobby like it's not a big

1272
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,400
company at all it's just a couple of

1273
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:43,679
really nice programmers

1274
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,119
and uh they just they're from another

1275
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,219
country

1276
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,680
um they didn't understand like

1277
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:51,719
the complexities of asking like black

1278
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,159
market Growers for their social because

1279
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,639
what they were trying to do is make it

1280
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,799
easier for people to sign up for

1281
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,059
um to receive credit card payments so

1282
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,380
that's what the social would be used for

1283
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:04,259
signing you up for a virtual account

1284
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,539
blah blah blah but um

1285
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,880
yeah it also left them room for a lot of

1286
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:10,739
liability right so I talked to him about

1287
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,059
it and like they're like oh my God I

1288
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,919
hadn't thought about it from that angle

1289
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:15,358
the liability you know we're going to

1290
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,639
try to figure out a workaround for this

1291
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,739
and they actually went around trying to

1292
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:22,739
figure it out

1293
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:25,739
when philos when I was battling philos

1294
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:28,019
um and I I said no one had my back it's

1295
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:29,879
not entirely true because after about

1296
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:31,858
six months

1297
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,099
strainedly had my back

1298
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:36,719
and they came out and you know made a

1299
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,059
big public announcement on their site

1300
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:42,059
about why this is incorrect what's going

1301
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,440
on here blah blah blah and you know I

1302
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:44,639
had a lot of admiration for that because

1303
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,460
it

1304
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:50,279
it's not easy to take stands in this in

1305
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,920
this community and at that time there

1306
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,260
was no at the pros and cons for standing

1307
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,380
up against a corporation there were no

1308
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,940
Pros all cons and uh they did it anyways

1309
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,099
because it was the right thing to do so

1310
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,200
I just

1311
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,880
um you know I've run into problems where

1312
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,318
people pretend to have my seeds on there

1313
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,140
and are selling fake versions of my

1314
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:12,239
packs but like if I let them know

1315
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,039
they'll that person's gone they'll never

1316
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:14,939
sell on that site again you know what I

1317
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:17,579
mean so

1318
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,380
I can't like they're doing their at

1319
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,818
least due diligence and if people report

1320
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,338
it

1321
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,900
they they'll they'll handle it so I

1322
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:27,358
can't say anything bad about them in

1323
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,639
fact like I I have nothing but kind warm

1324
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,739
feelings for those dudes for sure yeah

1325
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:33,500
and I mean I'll say this as well because

1326
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:36,598
it's a Marketplace

1327
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,940
their primary motivator is not

1328
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:41,160
necessarily data in there you know in

1329
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,780
the same way as like seedfinder or or

1330
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:44,279
Leafly

1331
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,200
um correct they are just about

1332
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,740
facilitating you know transactions

1333
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:52,558
exactly so different yeah easily

1334
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:55,199
facilitate transactions between person

1335
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,339
to person for you know cannabis genetics

1336
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,259
or otherwise

1337
00:50:56,338 --> 00:51:00,299
which makes a lot of sense because those

1338
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,880
things are difficult so it's necessary

1339
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,859
and that's the thing like despite my own

1340
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,358
stuff being like fake versions of my

1341
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:09,119
stuff being sold on there all the time

1342
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:11,338
because I think it's necessary and I

1343
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,680
think it's hella like piratey and like

1344
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:15,239
cool to do like I can't hate on it at

1345
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,618
all there's nothing I can negative I can

1346
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,139
say about things I'm like that's kind of

1347
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:19,920
punk rock either way you know like

1348
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:21,299
everybody's gonna get [ __ ] to some

1349
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,280
degree but like

1350
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,780
I think overall I think it's a neat

1351
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,200
experience and and we need the ability

1352
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,880
to be to do person-to-person buying and

1353
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,078
realistically it's buyer beware and if

1354
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,358
you're not doing your research then

1355
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,400
that's on you you know like so in that

1356
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,420
sense I'm also very supportive of what

1357
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,160
they do

1358
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,019
yeah that was exactly what I was going

1359
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:42,000
to point out that the onus is less on

1360
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:44,280
them and on you know everyone else who's

1361
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,619
in the community to be vetting each

1362
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,839
other it's more of a peer peer review

1363
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:49,740
process we'll say exactly

1364
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:51,659
um

1365
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:53,039
like like a like if you were like a

1366
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:54,659
[ __ ] on eBay you know you're not

1367
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,480
going to get very far

1368
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:59,779
um yeah so luckily they are way more

1369
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,099
responsive than eBay

1370
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,740
they're so there's they've been so cool

1371
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:06,900
over the years so I yeah I'll shout out

1372
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:09,358
to them shout out shout out

1373
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,579
so what's cool about what we're doing I

1374
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,759
think today I didn't really realize is

1375
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:19,019
um so a little bit of a history on like

1376
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:21,900
these different like uh online projects

1377
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:26,099
whether they're about like e-commerce or

1378
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:27,599
data or you know like this has been

1379
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:30,300
the recent

1380
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,440
you know 10 to 20 years of cannabis

1381
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,318
um

1382
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,900
in the internet age in the social media

1383
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,838
age and

1384
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,338
yeah it's because you know we we talk a

1385
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:42,900
lot about social media but we haven't

1386
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:44,818
talked about some of these websites

1387
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,318
before so I think

1388
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:48,000
now that we're getting into it I'm like

1389
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,318
this is really cool

1390
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,599
um yeah and this is definitely stuff

1391
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,818
that I didn't really think about uh us

1392
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,920
discussing before so I'm glad we got it

1393
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:57,719
yeah you know people if people are

1394
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,220
probably used to hearing me

1395
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:02,279
and I talked with someone about this

1396
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:03,899
earlier like I'm often like dismissed

1397
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,300
because

1398
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,519
I'm called the hater of the industry you

1399
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,200
know because I don't people ask me

1400
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,838
questions about certain breeders and

1401
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,699
like it really does from a lot of

1402
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:16,500
perspectives from people who don't know

1403
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:19,019
like sound like I just hate everyone

1404
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,059
like I just am dismissive of everything

1405
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:22,739
and everyone

1406
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:24,359
um but reality I have a lot of like

1407
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:27,419
personal interaction with a lot of these

1408
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:29,219
people and um it's nice to to be able to

1409
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,900
say something nice about good people in

1410
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:33,118
the industry because I really

1411
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,380
unfortunately feel like it's so far and

1412
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,260
few between

1413
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,940
um as a as a gray area like that's what

1414
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,800
you get it draws a lot of people like

1415
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,838
that and you have to compete with them

1416
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,119
in the same Marketplace in the same

1417
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:47,338
industry and the same passion in this

1418
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,140
case which is really really screwy for a

1419
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:52,440
lot of people

1420
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:55,379
yeah and it's not like we have a perfect

1421
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,179
thing to show you know our codex well

1422
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,640
exactly of course really excited to talk

1423
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:02,460
about it and to launch and share it

1424
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:04,139
um of course has serious limits so sure

1425
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,940
um no one you know no one's gonna get

1426
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:08,818
this perfect at least not anytime soon

1427
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,858
from what I can tell we will um

1428
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:13,619
we will

1429
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:15,539
um but like Matt was saying definitely

1430
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:17,818
worth shouting out all the like cool

1431
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:19,980
cool effort and work and time that

1432
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:22,019
people have put into this uh one thing I

1433
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,719
wanted to say before philos had their

1434
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:27,119
their visual Galaxy seedfinder had their

1435
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,399
Galaxy it was visual so I will say that

1436
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,818
part too it actually started with us

1437
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,619
yeah yeah yeah it's just fightless Filas

1438
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:37,679
Galaxy had all the like bells and

1439
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:40,160
whistles it was like sure did it was 3D

1440
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:44,338
and like you could fly

1441
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,480
yeah this was 3D in the same way but it

1442
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:46,920
was

1443
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,500
um I don't know where it went it was

1444
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,019
like a star map type thing uh on seed

1445
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,579
Fighters I think it's gone I'm not sure

1446
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:55,318
I don't want to say it but I think I I

1447
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:57,599
had a hard time finding it at least last

1448
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:59,579
time I looked for it I don't know if I

1449
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,260
ever saw it yeah it was there from the

1450
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,579
site to start it was really nice and

1451
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,740
that's what I really wanted because it

1452
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:06,359
was a beautiful representation of it

1453
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:09,899
yeah

1454
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:11,699
I mean I'll say this uh maybe I don't

1455
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,139
know how necessary or a little Barb it

1456
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:15,539
is but you know one thing that can be

1457
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:17,699
said about seed funder and strangely I

1458
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:20,159
think you can kind of feel the passion

1459
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:22,259
there a bit more like you can kind of

1460
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,838
tell that these people who like really

1461
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,579
care and like just trying to help

1462
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,259
and not saying that Leafly and philos

1463
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,359
don't care or don't want to help at all

1464
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,700
but like you can kind of see that there

1465
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:33,779
are other motivating factors with those

1466
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:36,899
two

1467
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:39,000
websites um in in the comments below I'd

1468
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,220
love to hear people's thoughts on all of

1469
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,920
these sites whether it's brainly your

1470
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:45,959
experiences exchanging stuff on there

1471
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,760
um you know Leafly I'm sure we're gonna

1472
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,280
have plenty of funny stories about

1473
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:54,140
weekly and people's experiences there

1474
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,140
um yeah so please tell us

1475
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:58,460
um if nothing else doesn't matter I do

1476
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,739
want to give a couple of shout outs to

1477
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:03,900
one broadly the forums

1478
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:08,098
um of course like we've talked about the

1479
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:10,019
forums plenty as far as uh they go as

1480
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,660
sources of information obviously very

1481
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:14,519
important but also obviously extremely

1482
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:18,779
noisy and

1483
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:21,780
um yeah and extremely complete extremely

1484
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,000
incomplete now as well there's noisy

1485
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,800
yeah and you know forums there's no

1486
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,500
formalization of the data there aren't

1487
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,300
like four more models or Maps or

1488
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,920
anything like that you know people

1489
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,740
talking so

1490
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,880
obviously still a very important site of

1491
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:38,098
uh

1492
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,099
exchange and information

1493
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,099
um

1494
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,000
um I wanted to point out one other place

1495
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:46,920
that I don't know many people know about

1496
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,159
um and it's called grow Diaries and it

1497
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,960
sounds a bit Naf but why I like it is

1498
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,618
that they don't do that thing where they

1499
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,480
say ah here is chemdog and then it's

1500
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:59,400
like anyone growing like any kind of

1501
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,019
thing that has vaguely got to do with

1502
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,838
Kim or says it has to do with cameras

1503
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:08,280
under it what they do is clever they say

1504
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:11,818
we go by company and product

1505
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,960
and so you can specifically look at like

1506
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:14,940
say you've bought something you're

1507
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,619
looking at buying something you can

1508
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,159
actually go and look at that particular

1509
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:21,900
brand or seed company or breeder look at

1510
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:25,739
people who are actually growing those

1511
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:28,139
seeds and not like any kind of weird

1512
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:30,118
white label version

1513
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:32,818
um and the other thing I like about how

1514
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:35,700
they present information is that

1515
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:37,259
they've structured they structure it so

1516
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:39,239
that like you can kind of choose which

1517
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,819
week of the girl you want to go and look

1518
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:43,919
at any time

1519
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:46,679
um to me they've got an example of like

1520
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,800
good structured information about

1521
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:51,480
someone's growth historically

1522
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,160
um and I don't see it presented like

1523
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,559
that anywhere else

1524
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:57,480
um but they're good Growers on there

1525
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,220
I can't say that like I think it's

1526
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,619
definitely a range

1527
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:04,259
um it's it's definitely like a anyone

1528
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:06,059
anyone can rock up and and just show are

1529
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,040
there a lot of Veteran Growers and

1530
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:10,319
breeders on there I'm wondering

1531
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't know I don't know well enough to

1532
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:12,920
be able to tell you that I wonder

1533
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,539
um

1534
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,639
it It suffers from some of the same

1535
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:19,380
limits as the others like it also does

1536
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:22,679
that thing where it tries to aggregate

1537
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,180
like effect information or like they

1538
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:25,980
survey like the grower and it's like

1539
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:28,318
okay what did you smell what what

1540
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,780
effects did you see but I think they

1541
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,099
don't they don't make us bold a claim

1542
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,079
like they don't what they don't do is

1543
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:36,298
they don't try to like abstract from

1544
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,099
everyone and say like this is the data

1545
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:39,798
they just say this is this person's data

1546
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:42,359
that's that person's style

1547
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:43,980
as a grower yeah presenting that that's

1548
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:46,199
fine

1549
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,880
I mean I think it's like an honest way

1550
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:49,199
to present information you know whatever

1551
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,318
information that you have without

1552
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:54,239
overstating it sure

1553
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,880
at the same time you know it's still

1554
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:59,479
also definitely caters towards a more

1555
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,099
mainstream growing audience

1556
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:04,199
if you go on that site I I could almost

1557
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:06,960
bet without even going to it that like

1558
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:11,460
99 of it's like DNA Greenhouse benefit

1559
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,900
like just Bam Bam Bam the top 50 ones is

1560
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,639
that what it is

1561
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,838
yeah the most you know all those big

1562
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,000
Brands will definitely have the most

1563
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,440
Growers and the most Diaries because

1564
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,059
they represent the biggest part of the

1565
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:26,579
marketplace has to great yes so would we

1566
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:28,798
be able to find uh Riot seeds I bet I

1567
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:31,519
think you could but it may not be as

1568
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:31,519
many yeah

1569
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:36,599
yeah

1570
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,159
um but again you know a point of

1571
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:40,079
difference here is that

1572
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,118
uh it's specific to the product it's

1573
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,119
specific to the breeder and you don't

1574
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:46,798
have to deal with the weird like

1575
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,539
um what what do they what do I call it

1576
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,759
like

1577
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:54,779
kind of conflation

1578
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,099
um of varying yeah see like seed

1579
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:58,260
products from all kinds of different

1580
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:59,099
people yeah

1581
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,900
um

1582
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,960
uh was there anything else I wanted to

1583
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:06,180
say about these guys

1584
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,280
I think even though I didn't take that

1585
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:09,960
much from the website it did give me an

1586
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,900
idea that like there are different ways

1587
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,159
to model cannabis information

1588
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,798
um this is actually pretty good

1589
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,480
structured way

1590
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:19,259
yeah it's not about to say it's kind of

1591
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,179
cool

1592
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,980
I think it's novel I don't think anyone

1593
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:25,739
else has done it like them and I thought

1594
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:28,019
that was cool no this is decent this is

1595
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:31,500
cool yeah so shout out to grow Diaries

1596
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:33,659
and uh check them out um decent side

1597
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,400
like I was like oh about ready to knock

1598
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:37,558
I'm like uh you know what it's just

1599
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,298
probably gonna be all noobs and like a

1600
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:41,819
like a roll it up blah blah blah it's

1601
01:00:39,298 --> 01:00:44,759
not bad it's not I'm an idiot it's not

1602
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:46,798
bad at all yeah to me it's like an

1603
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,720
improved version of like a forum growth

1604
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,159
rate yeah

1605
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,659
you know like

1606
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,598
you know like everyone you know grow

1607
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:56,219
Diaries on forums obviously very popular

1608
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,780
but again the problem is that like it's

1609
01:00:56,219 --> 01:01:00,480
very hard for you to come through the

1610
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:02,000
data in any kind of structured way

1611
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,679
um

1612
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,960
all the right seed stuff in here is Club

1613
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:09,480
Riot seeds whatever that is

1614
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,280
Club riots so there's some seed company

1615
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,500
called Club Riot seeds that popped up

1616
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,900
within the last like year or two yeah

1617
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,000

1621
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:26,098
their name might conflict with another

1622
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:29,239
breeder like that and they're and like

1623

01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:12,239
they're probably they're prey for

1643
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,519
another country and don't have any clue

1644
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,618
who I am and I I don't expect yeah I do

1645
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:18,960
and don't care like you know yeah yeah

1646
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:21,780
let's not assume that they they they

1647
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,420
knew there's any malice no not at all I

1648
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:27,000
doubt it I doubt it

1649
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,858
yeah um any you know anything else Matt

1650
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,539
while you're on there anything else no

1651
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:32,460
it just looks kind of decent though yeah

1652
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:34,440
you know

1653
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,559
there's an American Autoflower Cup

1654
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:39,539
coming up apparently here in La which is

1655
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:43,798
crazy I never heard of that

1656
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:46,558
Indo cat trellis yeah um

1657
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:48,298
CSI CSI and his Auto flower he's gonna

1658
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,900
jump into it wait you'll see he's

1659
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,900
probably gonna be there

1660
01:02:53,338 --> 01:03:00,058
what we'll see we'll see we got projects

1661
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,199
um that's an interesting leak they did

1662
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,579
not expect

1663
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,798
um

1664
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:08,039
oh wait what was the last I think I had

1665
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:10,199
something else uh okay yeah I was gonna

1666
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:11,400
say is that if I were gonna set up like

1667
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:13,618
a

1668
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,019
like a grow database

1669
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:17,700
it'll be like this it'll be I would

1670
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:20,818
definitely take a cue from that you know

1671
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:22,919
that's cool it looks cool yeah because I

1672
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:24,779
can already as a as a as a developer

1673
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,280
like I can already see

1674
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,540
the way they extracted the data you

1675
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,798
could actually do lots and lots of cool

1676
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:31,259
stuff with how they've structured the

1677
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:32,940
data but anyway yeah oh uh shout out to

1678
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,980

Codex finally let's do it

1688
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:00,179
our codex yeah so Matt I don't know do

1689
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:02,338
you remember how it got started

1690
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:04,558
um vaguely vaguely

1691
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:08,699
um you tell me what you remember

1692
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:10,500
I remember you asking me if there was

1693
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:13,259
anything

1694
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:16,139
I had ever like tried to want to build

1695
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:18,960
or something do you is that correct

1696
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:20,159
okay I'll give more context because I

1697
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,139
remember some other weird things about

1698
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,699
this yeah I think it was like right

1699
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:24,719
after Christmas like everyone was in

1700
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:27,358
that like

1701
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:29,279
weird like post Christmas pre-new years

1702
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,500
like okay that's familiar

1703
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,960
at a loose end a bit maybe people just

1704
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:37,500
chilling yeah I think I think you were

1705
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:40,440
talking to quasia about a database or

1706
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:43,739
like having thought about your own yes

1707
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,240
that's right and I think so it started

1708
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:47,338
with you two and then

1709
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:48,899
I think I just was like I think quasi

1710
01:04:47,338 --> 01:04:51,420
had some like pretty sophisticated ideas

1711
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,500
I was like well if we wanted to do like

1712
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,780
a

1713
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,699
a simpler version of this I could see

1714
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,740
how we could do it and I could you know

1715
01:04:56,699 --> 01:05:01,500
I couldn't prototype something pretty

1716
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:04,139
quickly yeah

1717
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:07,380
and it was pretty wild just like you

1718
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:08,759
were just like yeah do it yeah yeah I

1719
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,559
mean like time

1720
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,420
yeah good did you even we didn't even

1721
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,859
know each other I don't think no not

1722
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,059
really no we didn't have a lot of

1723
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:18,199
interaction

1724
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:18,200
um right before that no

1725
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:22,979
and I wonder if you actually thought

1726
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:24,659
anything would come of it at the time

1727
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:28,318
um I didn't

1728
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:30,480
when someone had asked me that like well

1729
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,880
if I had any if I could have anything

1730
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,798
built what would it be and I was like

1731
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,720
well the one thing we all need is like a

1732
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:38,639
reliable genetic database and you know

1733
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,358
and I talked about the philosophy behind

1734
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:40,558
it

1735
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,058
and

1736
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,099
I I

1737
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:45,900
was kind of like offhand statement it

1738
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:47,700
was late at night like I didn't really

1739
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:51,059
think much of it

1740
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:53,399
and then like within two days there was

1741
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:56,280
serious development done to the point

1742
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,780
where I was like oh my God like I've got

1743
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,280
to start entering stuff because these

1744
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,960
guys have done so much work now I can't

1745
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,119
like I got to do something like I'm

1746
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,440
gonna have to act this is for real and

1747
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,838
this is serious and like coming together

1748
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,298
this is amazing like this is some

1749
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,159
serious stuff and can make and be and

1750
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:13,920
and I think

1751
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:15,838
um help help at least be one resource

1752
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,599
for people

1753
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,000
to to go to that they can hopefully

1754
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,680
people will feel as reliable enough you

1755
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,719
know for their data

1756
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:26,818
I can tell a bit more of this from my

1757
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:28,919
side as well so

1758
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:30,480
I I know that in the U.S Christmas break

1759
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,680
isn't that long for people who are

1760
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,699
working right it's like only like a

1761
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:33,960
couple of weeks it's not like the

1762
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:36,179
biggest holiday

1763
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,119
um on the planet for you guys but

1764
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:40,500
for us it's it's Christmas happens

1765
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:43,079
during summer

1766
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:45,239
and like this if you can imagine that

1767
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:47,579
and then the country kind of almost

1768
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:50,578
shuts down for like two months it feels

1769
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:51,960
like from like December to like Feb

1770
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:55,019
it feels like the country goes really

1771
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,579
quiet because people just go out to it

1772
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:59,159
like people go to the beaches and stuff

1773
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:01,680
and children oh wow that's kind of cool

1774
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:04,379
so for me it's always this kind of weird

1775
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:06,899
it's a nice time but it's kind of like a

1776
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:09,900
bit Restless it's weirdly quiet

1777
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:12,420
and I think when the idea came about so

1778
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,760
obviously context I'm a web developer

1779
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:17,639
and when the idea came about like I was

1780
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,980
like I've actually done some stuff with

1781
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:21,838
similar kinds of data

1782
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,579
uh and representing similar kinds of

1783
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:25,078
data like relationships and you know

1784
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:27,359
kind of like Network maps of

1785
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:29,400
relationships and I'll say you know I

1786
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,440
think I could actually like do this

1787
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,858
pretty quick or at least have

1788
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:37,440
prototype pretty quick yeah and so I

1789
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:40,139
think I just had the I got on the buzz I

1790
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,480
was I had a lot of energy and I was I

1791
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:44,400
had like a manic couple of weeks maybe

1792
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,039
like two to three weeks of just smashing

1793
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:50,039
it it was insane bro

1794
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,599
like it was like I wasn't smashing it it

1795
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:53,280
was like you'd be like you know is there

1796
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,079
anything else like you can think of and

1797
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:59,700
then there'd be something I'd pop up and

1798
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:01,798
I I'd be like I because I some context I

1799
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:04,199
was a web developer and in my past life

1800
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:06,719
here that's right I know how much a lot

1801
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:09,358
of this stuff costs and I know how much

1802
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:10,919
like knowledge it takes to do this stuff

1803
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,980
and

1804
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,659
the asks that I was asking weren't

1805
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:17,338
necessarily things that I could achieve

1806
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:19,979
easy but I know how much it would cost

1807
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:21,659
to have them implemented so like when he

1808
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:24,599
was asking like these things I was like

1809
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:27,238
I don't even feel comfortable saying you

1810
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,679
know but and and eventually you get it

1811
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:31,559
out of me and then it would be done and

1812
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:32,659
like you know a few hours it seems

1813
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,120
anyway

1814
01:08:32,659 --> 01:08:37,439
it was amazing it it was because it was

1815
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,179
like really watching something come to

1816
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:42,178
life it wasn't a slow progression it was

1817
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:43,679
like boom and it's here and it's just

1818
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:47,460
like this is everything I ever wanted

1819
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,980
but now it's like oh it's so serious

1820
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:51,960
it was a fun period for me it was like I

1821
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:53,639
was on holiday and I got to talk to Matt

1822
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,079
who I'd never interacted with and I was

1823
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,039
like this is nuts that we're doing this

1824
01:08:55,079 --> 01:09:01,500
but yeah it was a blast

1825
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:04,140
I also will say it was a lot of trust in

1826
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,640
you for me because you really didn't

1827
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,140
know me and I could have been the

1828
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,838
scumbag that everyone said just been

1829
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:12,420
like yeah thanks bro you know like

1830
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:14,519
thanks nice to know you you know but

1831
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,079
like I I really appreciated all that

1832
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,839
trust you because I knew how much time

1833
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:20,519
and and not just time but like that's a

1834
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:22,079
labor of love doing something like that

1835
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,540
you're really passionate about cannabis

1836
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:27,359
as it shows so like this is an actual

1837
01:09:24,539 --> 01:09:28,920
labor of love like it is for me so at

1838
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,500
the same time it wasn't just like

1839
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:35,699
building it for me it became our baby

1840
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,880
bro we had a baby together yeah

1841
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:41,219
I'm proud of that baby

1842
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,020
yes absolutely and maybe at this point

1843
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:44,460
we can State some of their aims because

1844
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,540
[Music]

1845
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:48,359
um

1846
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:50,880
so I think like what we said before

1847
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,279
um information like this

1848
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,239
is very sensitive it carries a lot of

1849
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,000
weight

1850
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,619
and one thing I I think in terms of

1851
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,260
strategy one thing I really didn't want

1852
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:04,500
to do was overstate or over represent

1853
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:06,300
anything yeah so I knew off the bat we

1854
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,219
weren't going to be doing like effects

1855
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,739
we weren't going to be doing smells and

1856
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:15,420
flavors we I was just like let's stick

1857
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:18,899
to our strengths here Matt has a lot of

1858
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:21,359
Knowledge from his time his interactions

1859
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:23,939
with people his actual work

1860
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,079
and that's the information we want to

1861
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:27,719
present

1862
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:30,899
and we don't want to yeah overall

1863
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:34,020
understate that you know we know it's

1864
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:37,738
not like genetic or genomic mapping

1865
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:40,320
um and we're never going to do that uh

1866
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:41,639
conceivably so the next best thing was

1867
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,599
like

1868
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,600
presenting

1869
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,760
I don't know Matt how would you frame

1870
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,679
this like

1871
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,659
how would you frame the information that

1872
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,060
we have on there from your point of view

1873
01:10:51,658 --> 01:10:56,399
the information we have on there the way

1874
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:59,100
I'd Frame It Is by

1875
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:00,719
talking about all the things I saw wrong

1876
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:04,980
with everything else

1877
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:07,319
and like the little steps in my brain I

1878
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:10,379
took to like

1879
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:12,960
try to to beat all that

1880
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:14,940
like I like the crowdsourcing first

1881
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,100
thing that I knew that had to happen was

1882
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:18,419
no more crowdsourcing but I also knew

1883
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,219
that's probably going to piss a lot of

1884
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:21,420
people off and sound very elitist like

1885
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:23,279
that's the first thing that's going to

1886
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,199
happen is people that are going to feel

1887
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,579
excluded because their input wasn't

1888
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,439
taken into account or they're going to

1889
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:30,059
think that that their input wasn't taken

1890
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:33,899
into account

1891
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:36,420
um and realistically what my idea was

1892
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:38,939
from the beginning was to and I'm sure

1893
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,920
there's a lot of like perceived ideas

1894
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:43,019
about what's going to happen with it and

1895
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,319
like the intention behind it and agendas

1896
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:49,140
but realistically like my idea for it

1897
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,579
was to have essentially a place where

1898
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,619
people could go look at the most

1899
01:11:50,579 --> 01:11:55,500
important strains in cannabis the

1900
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:59,819
baselines that we talk about on here

1901
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:01,979
um land races get realistic like not

1902
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:03,899
just suppose data from people that may

1903
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:05,698
or may not be cannabis people over there

1904
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:07,738
that are trying to sell seeds and blah

1905
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:09,419
blah blah people who are over there that

1906
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:12,059
are researchers that are doing this

1907
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,039
stuff that are that have good input are

1908
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,620
going to be putting in like to the land

1909
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:17,579
Race part that's not my expertise so

1910
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:21,179
like

1911
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:22,979
but with with my the one thing I do know

1912
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:25,140
is people because I've been in the scene

1913
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:28,198
so long so it's not necessarily just

1914
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,880
about my knowledge of strains it's about

1915
01:12:28,198 --> 01:12:31,500
my knowledge of people who have the

1916
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,659
knowledge of those strengths most

1917
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,460
importantly which is what the show is in

1918
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:38,039
a sense you know like me bringing those

1919
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:40,260
people together to talk and now this is

1920
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:43,560
aggregating that data

1921
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:46,739
yeah yeah so you could almost see it

1922
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,780
like Matt is facilitating curating this

1923
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:50,218
database and

1924
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:52,738
you know obviously a major difference

1925
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:54,899
between that and some of the other

1926
01:12:52,738 --> 01:12:56,819
databases we mentioned is that these

1927
01:12:54,899 --> 01:12:59,099
people weren't part of the industry

1928
01:12:56,819 --> 01:13:01,500
conceivably

1929
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,420
um and we're not there or present um

1930
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,719
when a lot of this was going on and Matt

1931
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:08,819
Matt is one of those people so even

1932
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,279
though of course you know you have the

1933
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:12,238
obvious trade-off of it being

1934
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,579
um

1935
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:15,839
met and perhaps like a smaller group of

1936
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:18,059
people

1937
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,679
um one of the benefits you get uh so

1938
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,659
okay we'll see we'll say straight up

1939
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:25,319
there like we have no

1940
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:27,059
no Ambitions or delusions about the

1941
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:28,920
perfect you know like how perfect the

1942
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:31,800
information is it's obviously going to

1943
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:35,100
be Matt's best account based on what he

1944
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:37,980
knows but what you do get is

1945
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,840
accountability transparency and like

1946
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:41,459
responsibility so

1947
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,219
you know this is a work in progress

1948
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:46,260
Matt's not even probably near done but

1949
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,658
we're going to launch it and Matt will

1950
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:50,100
conceivably be working on it eventually

1951
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:51,539
we might get more people to come and

1952
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,199
help

1953
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:54,779
um

1954
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:56,639
so again the idea is that keeping it to

1955
01:13:54,779 --> 01:14:00,119
a smaller group of people that we trust

1956
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,780
will at least introduce

1957
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:05,640
um

1958
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:08,219
a more reliable process of you know uh

1959
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,300
and more reliable feedback loops so even

1960
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:11,340
though the information may not be

1961
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:14,219
perfect at any one time the hope is that

1962
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:15,060
we can just keep improving it and that

1963
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,739
the same people are going to be

1964
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,500
responsible for it

1965
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:20,959
yeah and and

1966
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:23,219
again a lot of it's going to be

1967
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,840
different than what people perceive I'm

1968
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:26,698
not adding my own strains on there

1969
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,860
because I don't think my own strains are

1970
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:30,359
like the history are part of the history

1971
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:32,939
of cannabis I don't think I've done

1972
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:34,319
anything that's revolutionary per se so

1973
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:36,599
my my strains are not going to be on

1974
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:38,158
this site presenting them as like like

1975
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,300
this these are important kind of sneak

1976
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:40,738
them in the back door that's not what

1977
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,600
it's for it's not like built with an

1978
01:14:40,738 --> 01:14:44,459
agenda like that

1979
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,380
um I mean realistically what I wanted

1980
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:48,719
was something for me to go in resource

1981
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,920
and I don't need to Resource info on my

1982
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,658
strains because they're in my head I

1983
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,520
think that's a really good point by the

1984
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:57,119
way I think we were building what we

1985
01:14:53,520 --> 01:15:00,060
wanted to consume ourselves

1986
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:03,658
here we go yeah sure

1987
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:06,780
[ __ ] Adam bird okay go ahead sorry

1988
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:08,219
um that was so well timed we we just

1989
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:09,539
wanted to ultimately we wanted to build

1990
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:11,579
something that we ourselves would be

1991
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:13,140
interested in going and looking at yeah

1992
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:14,399
you know we wanted to build a thing that

1993
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,179
we dreamed of

1994
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,158
um

1995
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:18,359
and

1996
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:20,039
yeah and I wanted something I could

1997
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:22,920
share with my breeder friends like as a

1998
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:25,738
resource and that was mainly it like

1999
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,940
um oh sorry sorry Matt one more thing

2000
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:28,559
that I wanted to just make sure was

2001
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,779
really clear

2002
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,539
um to people is that we're not trying to

2003
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:37,439
have every single

2004
01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:39,899
cut of hype or noteworthiness on there

2005
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,738
it's really about like what Matt was

2006
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:42,420
saying

2007
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:45,599
it you can consider it like it's a Hall

2008
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:47,100
of Fame of sorts or like Legacy strains

2009
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,140
or whatever

2010
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:52,079
um it's more about that it's more about

2011
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:55,380
impact and history than it is about more

2012
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,880
plants yeah exactly and and some of the

2013
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,319
ones with a lot of Legend around them

2014
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,980
that we've tried to crack over the years

2015
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:04,439
like for example chem dog which you know

2016
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:06,299
is a very controversial strain and it

2017
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:09,479
was one of the ones that that took me

2018
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:11,520
some time and just thinking about it I

2019
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:14,579
figured out a few ways on how to

2020
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,159
approach it because it's not one that I

2021
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:19,079
could just approach from this is what

2022
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:20,819
we've seen in the plants from my

2023
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:23,819
perspective and other a few other

2024
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:25,920
British perspectives and this is what

2025
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:27,840
they are I didn't feel comfortable just

2026
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,719
doing that

2027
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:34,020
that's one where I feel like it needs to

2028
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,179
have all of the the history with it the

2029
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:39,420
the Forum posts from chemdog himself

2030
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:41,460
from peabud from JJ New York from

2031
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:45,060
everyone that's been involved all the

2032
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:47,939
way up the line every last one of their

2033
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:49,920
quotes so everyone can make you know

2034
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:52,079
conclusions for themselves based on what

2035
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,840
these guys themselves said

2036
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:57,359
um it helps put a lot into perspective

2037
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,739
when you have all that stuff and it

2038
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:01,079
helps it also

2039
01:16:58,738 --> 01:17:03,238
be a more valuable historical resource

2040
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:04,920
because it's not just me telling you

2041
01:17:03,238 --> 01:17:06,718
what I think based on my experience

2042
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:09,779
because that can always be based on

2043
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:12,600
faith or agenda this is me presenting

2044
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:15,238
all of not just my own conclusions but

2045
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,980
here is all the data that goes with it

2046
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:18,959
here's their conclusions here's the

2047
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:21,299
story that started with it and here's

2048
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,980
where I ended up so you can you can

2049
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,320
totally disregard anything that I have

2050
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:26,399
to say you can absolutely believe that

2051
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:27,599
everything you're reading in the Forum

2052
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,759
post and that's fine because it'll be up

2053
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,520
there for you to read and that's that's

2054
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,199
more of where I want to take it

2055
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,140
um I mean

2056
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:38,879
chem dog was a perfect scenario strain

2057
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:41,760
or something like that where it was just

2058
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,039
like what is what is presenting what I

2059
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,719
think enough or do I need to present

2060
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,579
stuff that I may not necessarily even

2061
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:50,158
agree with all the time

2062
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:53,880
um but I think it's important maybe to

2063
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:56,219
to present that too uh as as complete as

2064
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:58,260
possible and not Cherry Picked too

2065
01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:00,239
yeah yeah and I think the important

2066
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:01,920
thing to point out here is that like to

2067
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:03,959
me

2068
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,179
you know as someone who works with with

2069
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,399
data a lot in my other life

2070
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:10,739
um information

2071
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:14,219
and Gathering knowledge it's a process

2072
01:18:10,738 --> 01:18:19,379
yeah it's first and foremost a process

2073
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:20,880
so if this website can embody that

2074
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:23,520
process

2075
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,859
um that's that's really all you know

2076
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,719
like I mean not not sorry not that's not

2077
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:30,599
all but like

2078
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:32,939
that's

2079
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:35,159
that's something that like can be relied

2080
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:37,859
upon regardless of the state of

2081
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:39,359
information yeah because you know if you

2082
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:40,738
can trust the process you know at least

2083
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:43,738
that the information will

2084
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:44,519
beginning validated and proved that

2085
01:18:43,738 --> 01:18:46,500
there's someone who's actually

2086
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,840
accountable for it like you can you know

2087
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:51,539
that Matt's name for better or worse is

2088
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,800
on those entries yeah um yeah and

2089
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:54,840
because another thing that's worth

2090
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,940
saying as well even though that's Matt's

2091
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,860
name Matt is connected with a whole

2092
01:18:56,939 --> 01:19:01,139
bunch of people who he talks to a lot

2093
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:02,698
about these things so implicitly those

2094
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:06,719
people are there their names are not

2095
01:19:02,698 --> 01:19:09,119
necessarily there but you know Matt is

2096
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,579
definitely talking to CSI about this

2097
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:13,738
stuff for example yeah there's one of

2098
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:15,420
many people that yeah and and I'm

2099
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:18,299
talking to people that I highly respect

2100
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:20,579
like it's not just my opinion on a lot

2101
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:24,060
of this stuff it's the people who I

2102
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:26,760
respect and you know like taking their

2103
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:29,520
work and putting it on there and like

2104
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:30,960
you know like I'm I'm reaching out some

2105
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,940
of them aren't on there because I'm

2106
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,739
waiting for you know CSI to give me back

2107
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:36,839
some freaking input because I don't want

2108
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:39,359
to put my my data up there because my

2109
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,340
frankly I like I on certain strains

2110
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,380
maybe I don't even trust my own

2111
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,600
experience with them because maybe I got

2112
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:48,239
a specific clone from a dispensary or uh

2113
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,739
or even maybe I got it from a source

2114
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,059
that's good but maybe it's not as good

2115
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:52,319
as his source and maybe he had a

2116
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:55,140
different experience you know and I'd

2117
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:58,319
rather rather that be up there because

2118
01:19:55,140 --> 01:20:01,739
um I I trust his input more than mine

2119
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,359
based on just obvious experience you

2120
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:04,439
know very obvious experience in that

2121
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:06,658
case

2122
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:10,198
and you know Matt like ultimately you

2123
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:12,319
also have the freedom to

2124
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:12,319
um

2125
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:16,079
how would I put it you also have the

2126
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,359
freedom to like Express where they're

2127
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,500
conflicting perspectives right like I

2128
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:21,059
think you probably have in some of those

2129
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,439
entries written like this is what I

2130
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:24,659
think but some other people think this

2131
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:27,299
yep and maybe it's it's a good time for

2132
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:29,639
me to actually briefly outline like what

2133
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:32,579
you can see on the entries yeah do that

2134
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:34,020
so yeah so uh Matt I left a link to the

2135
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:35,100
chem dog one in the chat if you want to

2136
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,540
go and quickly look at it while I'm

2137
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,340
saying this but

2138
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:40,198
so the first thing you see you can see

2139
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:43,500
the parents at least what we know of the

2140
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:45,479
parents you can see the aliases I.E the

2141
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,920
various names this cut or line has had

2142
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:49,799
yeah

2143
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:51,840
um you can see the children

2144
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,119
um a really important thing that we

2145
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,819
added in uh we'll come back to this

2146
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:58,380
anecdote later yeah um a bit of ice

2147
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:00,960
covering we added what we call

2148
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:03,420
information certainty yeah and this is

2149
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,698
for Matt to be like hey this is wild

2150
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:07,980
speculation like don't you know take

2151
01:21:05,698 --> 01:21:11,339
this with a huge grain of you know A

2152
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:13,379
Fistful of salt or on the other end of

2153
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:15,900
it no this is like pretty damn certain

2154
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:17,279
like I'm very confident in this yeah so

2155
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:19,859
there's a little rating just to kind of

2156
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,179
indicate like yeah uh how certain Matt

2157
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:24,119
is

2158
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:26,039
then there's filial generation there is

2159
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:27,719
whether this is referring to a line or

2160
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:29,819
cut which I think is very important

2161
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:32,460
because often that's like

2162
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:36,000
uh very blurry yeah you know is this a

2163
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:39,000
line or is this an individual plot yeah

2164
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,579
um Matt we've also listed like some of

2165
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,319
the people we know have either are

2166
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:44,100
holding or have historically have been

2167
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:48,359
known

2168
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:50,340
uh to have held uh these plants yeah we

2169
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:52,859
have a year of origin region of origin

2170
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:55,980
just broad description

2171
01:21:52,859 --> 01:22:00,479
and then we have like I was saying

2172
01:21:55,979 --> 01:22:03,718
before my you know early version of a

2173
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:06,178
philos galaxy type thing yes I do want

2174
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:09,658
to say that like this is what I'm most

2175
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:11,819
proud of and most embarrassed of because

2176
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:13,920
uh you'll notice that you can kind of

2177
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:16,619
zoom in on the immediate family

2178
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,840
which works pretty well once you go to

2179
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:21,359
the extended family I.E like the whole

2180
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:23,760
tree it gets pretty crazy

2181
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:26,399
so I'm gonna be that's going to be a

2182
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,860
work in progress kind of thing sure

2183
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,539
um and I will say this is like one of

2184
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:32,460
those things that it's it's been very

2185
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:35,158
hard for me

2186
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:37,619
um as far as getting other people to be

2187
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:40,319
actually do the actual data entry is

2188
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:43,198
because when let's see you're at a

2189
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:46,319
strain map and how you do it the logic

2190
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:48,658
behind it like if I just put BLD of

2191
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:50,698
Unknown Origin for example as a parent

2192
01:22:48,658 --> 01:22:53,039
and then linked all these to the parent

2193
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:55,799
then we would have a bunch of unrelated

2194
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:58,500
things linked to sisters and brothers

2195
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,179
and that's really easy to do so then I

2196
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,920
realized everything needs its own

2197
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:03,719
variable but I have to be able to

2198
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,060
remember in my head those variables so I

2199
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:07,679
don't reuse those variables so yeah it's

2200
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:09,360
crazy

2201
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,219
okay so just to be clear Matt's talking

2202
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:15,238
about a situation in real life

2203
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:16,920
yeah some some some famous plant we know

2204
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:20,579
we can guess that the parent is like

2205
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:23,819
yeah some like uh nld BLD

2206
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:26,219
and in the database that becomes its own

2207
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:28,979
entry that BLD or nld whatever it is

2208
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:30,779
generic thing and what Matt's saying is

2209
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:33,000
that he has to be careful not to

2210
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:36,960
actually assume that that represents the

2211
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,880
same individual plant yes and uh he has

2212
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,439
to distinguish them so unknown I'm just

2213
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,679
I'm just making it up up off the top of

2214
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:47,698
my head but you know unknown

2215
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:49,619
bld135 unknown BLD 27 you know they just

2216
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:51,238
make sure they get kept separate yeah

2217
01:23:49,619 --> 01:23:53,158
you can't be vague even when they're

2218
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,319
placeholders even when they're

2219
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:58,079
placeholders we need to be really clear

2220
01:23:55,319 --> 01:24:01,019
that they are separate placeholders and

2221
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:03,359
trying to teach people my syntax of like

2222
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:04,739
how I choose which variable and the name

2223
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:07,198
and

2224
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:09,000
it's been very hard very hard no one's

2225
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:11,099
picked it up yet so and I think it's

2226
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,539
actually been like kind of

2227
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,520
um some people are like oh I'm not even

2228
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:16,920
gonna try you know what I mean like

2229
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:18,659
because it is it's complicated the logic

2230
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,699
of it is complicated and you can't ever

2231
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:23,158
screw it up or the whole thing breaks in

2232
01:24:20,698 --> 01:24:25,619
my opinion yeah yeah

2233
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:26,698
so you know on on that note you know I

2234
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:28,920
should say

2235
01:24:26,698 --> 01:24:31,678
we want as much feedback as we can get

2236
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,359
from people you know um one thing that I

2237
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,219
haven't built yet that I really do want

2238
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,319
to build that man I discussed last week

2239
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:39,060
is actually a little like comments

2240
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:42,299
feature at the bottom so people can

2241
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:44,460
actually say what they think on the page

2242
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,800
um in the current absence of that please

2243
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,840
obviously comment here hit me or Matt up

2244
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,300
on IG if you have anything to say about

2245
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:54,420
any of the entries absolutely

2246
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:56,640
um uh last last couple of things that we

2247
01:24:54,420 --> 01:25:00,000
have on the plant Pages at the moment is

2248
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:02,159
a references section so the idea here is

2249
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,579
to link any other kind of content

2250
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:07,198
whether it's like a forum thread a breed

2251
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:09,840
of Syndicate episode anything anything

2252
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:12,238
we want to like try to flesh those

2253
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,460
references out again work in progress

2254
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:15,059
we're not quite there yet

2255
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,920
um

2256
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:18,719
but slowly

2257
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,819
um I think every page will become like a

2258
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:23,219
nice little Hub of different kinds of

2259
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:25,380
information and references I think so

2260
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:27,840
like there's great pictures of Kim one

2261
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:29,400
through four which are very hard to find

2262
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,920
you know what I mean like so it's a

2263
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:33,839
quick reference on stuff like that

2264
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,460
um yeah yeah photos sorry there are lots

2265
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,760
of photos well I mean where we have them

2266
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,960
yeah their photos

2267
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,280
um

2268
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,140
was there anything else we wanted to say

2269
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:45,059
about what we do have there Matt because

2270
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:48,480
I otherwise I wanted to move on to like

2271
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:50,580
things that I could see coming as well

2272
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,559
um no I think it's very um very much

2273
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:54,539
what we just said so yeah I think we're

2274
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,820
good oh my God we haven't even said

2275
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:58,679
where it is I mean we'll put a link in

2276
01:25:56,819 --> 01:26:02,399
the description but I'll say

2277
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:05,340
the website is codex Dot

2278
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,599
thebreedersyndicate.com

2279
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:10,619
correct

2280
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:12,420
so codex dot thebreeder syndicate.com

2281
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:13,979
um it's not been properly indexed on

2282
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:15,899
Google yet but I imagine once we start

2283
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:18,178
sharing the links out and people more

2284
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:19,500
people share them um yeah yeah onto

2285
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:22,139
Google soon

2286
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:25,319
I've been I've been a little hesitant to

2287
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:27,840
to put it out because for me like I want

2288
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:29,639
it to be as complete as possible but

2289
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,279
realistically with everything going on

2290
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:34,199
like the ability to constantly add to

2291
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:38,880
it's been taken away from time to time

2292
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:40,619
and yeah um it's it's pretty good and we

2293
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,719
need to start somewhere you know what I

2294
01:26:40,619 --> 01:26:44,158
mean so I think uh I think I'm good with

2295
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,859
adding it now

2296
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:50,638
so really what Matt's saying please be

2297
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:53,339
patient please be gentle if you can uh

2298
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:55,739
Mozilla with your feedback yeah

2299
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:57,239
um this is still very early

2300
01:26:55,738 --> 01:26:59,819
um yeah like Matt's saying and like I

2301
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:03,419
said you know keep implying uh oh you

2302
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:05,340
know keep saying it's a process and

2303
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:07,380
for any process like this the more

2304
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:09,480
feedback we can get the better it can be

2305
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:11,520
and

2306
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:13,799
yeah yeah so hopefully we'll have more

2307
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,440
feedback mechanisms available on the app

2308
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,420
itself soon but otherwise just reach out

2309
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:19,678
to us in whatever way you want comment

2310
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,420
on this video

2311
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,739
Etc

2312
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:24,239
yeah yeah

2313
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,799
um

2314
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,019
man I'm really going to ramble this one

2315
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,659
I guess I've got a lot to say about it

2316
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:33,480
um that's good it's good

2317
01:27:30,658 --> 01:27:35,759
I'll say one more thing uh and there's

2318
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:40,678
sort of gestures towards future stuff

2319
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:42,840
I kind of had a possible idea that like

2320
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:46,619
other people could also use this for

2321
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:48,360
adding their own entries I.E if you're a

2322
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:50,340
breeder or you know seed maker or

2323
01:27:48,359 --> 01:27:53,880
whatever hobbyist and you want to like

2324
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:55,260
map you know some for some family of

2325
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,659
relationships

2326
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:59,039
I thought about opening it up the

2327
01:27:57,658 --> 01:28:01,198
problem is that

2328
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:03,420
that in itself introduces a whole bunch

2329
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:05,399
of new possible problems like should

2330
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:07,920
those entries go into the main like Hall

2331
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:10,079
of Fame section how do we keep people's

2332
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:14,699
data like separate should it be private

2333
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:16,500
so I haven't really moved on it yet I I

2334
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:19,619
think we can guess that it would be

2335
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:21,658
popular and that it it would get some

2336
01:28:19,619 --> 01:28:25,319
you know uptake but

2337
01:28:21,658 --> 01:28:27,539
I would think yeah personally I think

2338
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:30,299
just thinking about it like it would be

2339
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:32,579
cool if people could have it as a

2340
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:34,679
separate and public thing that they

2341
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:36,300
could share if they wanted to

2342
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:38,039
um only because I was thinking back to a

2343
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,420
seed finder like if they would have had

2344
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:41,279
something like that like that would have

2345
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:43,020
been really cool you know

2346
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:44,698
um would have served the purpose but you

2347
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:48,239
know it didn't so

2348
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:49,738
you know I think that's not a bad idea I

2349
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,399
can kind of see like two different

2350
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:54,899
Downstream like implementation

2351
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:56,460
implementations of this one is like we

2352
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:58,500
extend what we have

2353
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:00,300
which I've I have tried a little bit

2354
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,460
like we have had people come on already

2355
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:03,779
and I've tried to be like okay maybe we

2356
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:05,639
can just let them add stuff to their

2357
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:07,738
page but it doesn't go into the Hall of

2358
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:10,079
Fame but that has other complications

2359
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:12,479
the other possibility is I basically

2360
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,760
make an alternative version of this

2361
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:16,500
that's just for the community

2362
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,960
um where I rip obviously most of the

2363
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:22,439
code but I change it slightly

2364
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:24,840
but you know it's interesting

2365
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:26,759
yeah yeah the difficulty here I think

2366
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,920
for me is that

2367
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,679
the the problem with software is that

2368
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,859
once you have it up and you're saying

2369
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,719
that other people can join add stuff

2370
01:29:33,859 --> 01:29:41,899
maintenance cost and risk can kind of

2371
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:45,119
like really blow out yeah yeah you know

2372
01:29:41,899 --> 01:29:49,019
like it's hard to know whether or not we

2373
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:50,219
have the the capacity to you know keep

2374
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:51,840
building and maintaining those things

2375
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:54,060
right God knows

2376
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:55,380
we'll see I would say that like what

2377
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:57,420
we've started with is already pretty

2378
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:59,760
ambitious so yeah we'll see how this all

2379
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:01,859
unfolds yeah and how the kind of

2380
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:03,980
interest that we might get

2381
01:30:01,859 --> 01:30:03,979
um

2382
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,060
what else is there to say about it

2383
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:13,020
I don't know if there's much else you

2384
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,840
know what do you think just just that

2385
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:18,780
you know like we do want to be inclusive

2386
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,699
with it eventually but you know like to

2387
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:22,439
start out it has to be a certain way to

2388
01:30:20,698 --> 01:30:24,960
establish the baselines and a lot of

2389
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:27,960
this is just simply me doing data entry

2390
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,480
from old catalogs that I have too

2391
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,279
um some of it is stuff like me getting

2392
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:34,738
you know pictures of Bubba Kush

2393
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:36,420
collecting all the info on all the data

2394
01:30:34,738 --> 01:30:38,099
from everybody I know that's reliable

2395
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,260
when it comes to Bubba Kush enter all

2396
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,980
that in you know each one

2397
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:43,380
um

2398
01:30:40,979 --> 01:30:46,198
you know as it relates to like blueberry

2399
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:48,300
go enter everything in every step of the

2400
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:50,158
way up so it's not incomplete so it

2401
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,840
never runs into a wall you know what I

2402
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:53,158
mean so there's a lot of little things

2403
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,719
like that

2404
01:30:53,158 --> 01:30:57,779
um that I wanted to do to get it right

2405
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:00,239
and I've done a lot of that so

2406
01:30:57,779 --> 01:31:02,099
um yeah there's not it's not one big

2407
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:04,319
agenda it's just gonna be a historical

2408
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,520
resource and you know when we first

2409
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:07,319
talked about it there's a lot of

2410
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,880
backlash from people something that was

2411
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:10,500
some of it was legitimate and some of it

2412
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,000
was just like what like it didn't make

2413
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,198
any sense to me

2414
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,179
um but I think there's a lot of

2415
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:17,460
perception on how people think it's

2416
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:21,359
gonna be handled and how people think it

2417
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:22,619
might turn out and realistically

2418
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:23,939
um I think a lot of people had a lot of

2419
01:31:22,619 --> 01:31:25,079
perceptions about how breeder Syndicate

2420
01:31:23,939 --> 01:31:26,519
was going to turn out what the agenda

2421
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:29,479
was and we're totally wrong so I'm

2422
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:32,460
interested to see how uh this unfolds

2423
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:34,619
I'll just say this to add a bit of uh

2424
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,600
add a bit of drama add a bit of spice

2425
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:38,399
and I want obviously go into the details

2426
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,560
but I

2427
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:42,238
early on while I was developing it you

2428
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,460
know I had a little at the time of

2429
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:46,198
fairly small Instagram following

2430
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:48,119
and I decided to take a screenshot of

2431
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:50,698
one of the pages and just put it up and

2432
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:52,859
it wasn't because necessarily of the

2433
01:31:50,698 --> 01:31:54,359
information on the page I just wanted to

2434
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:56,639
show what the website was looking like

2435
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:59,759
at that point we're proud yeah I was

2436
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:02,579
proud of it yeah but unfortunately uh

2437
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:06,119
some people got really offended by it

2438
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:07,439
and like it caused a bit of a yeah a

2439
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:09,359
scene

2440
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:11,879
um and I was just like oh my God it was

2441
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,738
my first taste I think of like the kinds

2442
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,980
of what I consider to be quite Petty

2443
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:18,839
drama yeah yeah they can arise in this

2444
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:20,399
uh world

2445
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,020
um and I expect that we will have we'll

2446
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,460
probably see more of that right oh

2447
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:26,520
without a doubt that was just one

2448
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:29,158
picture oh one of them yeah you know

2449
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,420
what I mean like the whole side that is

2450
01:32:29,158 --> 01:32:32,939
also when we did add the information

2451
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,139
certainty rating to be like yeah you

2452
01:32:32,939 --> 01:32:35,519
know and Matt actually that's a reminder

2453
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:38,219
you probably need to go through and add

2454
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:40,980
those to various entries yeah I could do

2455
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:43,920
that yeah I won't get that done

2456
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:45,359
um get that that ice covering it should

2457
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,819
be easy

2458
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:49,619
yeah yeah so I just wanted to relay that

2459
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:52,019
little anecdote just to it's just so

2460
01:32:49,619 --> 01:32:54,000
people have an idea of like some of the

2461
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:56,159
dramas that have occurred and probably

2462
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,340
will will occur once now that we're

2463
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:02,279
launching it oh sure yeah but yeah I

2464
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:03,840
invite it like you know like I don't I

2465
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:05,219
don't understand if I draw that sucks

2466
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,960
like nobody wants to deal with that even

2467
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:09,060
my dumb ass doesn't that goes with it

2468
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,340
all day doesn't want to deal with it

2469
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:13,320
um but I do invite criticism and I do

2470
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:15,659
invite people that have better knowledge

2471
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:17,519
than me to give me their input and that

2472
01:33:15,658 --> 01:33:18,779
isn't to say that like just because you

2473
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,900
think you're knowledge is better that

2474
01:33:18,779 --> 01:33:23,939
I'm gonna agree but it does also doesn't

2475
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:26,099
mean that I'm gonna disagree

2476
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:27,119
