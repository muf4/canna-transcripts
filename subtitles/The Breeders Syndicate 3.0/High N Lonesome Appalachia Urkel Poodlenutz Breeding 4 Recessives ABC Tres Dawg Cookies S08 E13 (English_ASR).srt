cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,660
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,479
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,460
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,500
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
we're the traditional Market

The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,140
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,280
this is the revolution

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,100
welcome Raider Syndicate I'm Matt here

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,359
with thousand fold and today we're going

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,500
to have our buddy Ian Lonesome back for

29
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,000
a more expansive more solo type gig and

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,739
I'm really stoked to have him here I

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
know thousand is as well we wanted to do

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,319
this for a while and I know it's

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,618
probably one of our most requested

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,478
episodes to go back and recover so thank

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,759
you for being with us

36
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,340
yeah thanks for having me

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,438
all right dude yeah

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,420
yeah so I think today we're just

39
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,519
following like a loose like linear

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,859
chronological

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,719
um structure so I think you know we

42
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,578
start at the start

43
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,618
um hi and Lonesome how did you what were

44
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,319
your first few interactions with the

45
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:47,400
plant you know how did you get into that

46
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,258
uh so I got into it pretty young uh as a

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,240
teenager

48
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,000
we would get you know Mexican brick

49
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,819
weeds that was all that was available

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
um I didn't have family doing it

51
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,719
anything like that

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,540
um so we did it it was always pretty

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,618
poor quality but it was loaded with

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,300
seeds

55
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:11,818
uh I come from a farming family so

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,160
you know I naturally planted seeds

57
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,719
pretty much initially you know probably

58
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,000
within

59
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,439
the first year of smoking I started

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,159
trying to grow it

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,378
um

62
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,079
it was

63
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:27,000
it was hit or miss but I think I had my

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,780
first harvest when I was

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,520
about 17 years old I grew to Mexican bag

66
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,098
seed

67
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,200
um got a quarter pound of weed and I was

68
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:40,579
dig digging all over High School I was

69
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,579
the coolest dude I knew

70
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,179
what was that

71
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,199
well you know

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,200
Mexican back then it was it was weird

73
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,780
you would get weed that was

74
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,179
dried like [ __ ] wasn't cured either

75
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,360
cured in a tire crossing the border or

76
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,840
you know it was just yeah God God awful

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,300
quality in the finished product but

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,819
you'd plant the seeds and

79
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,180
um you know you would get you'd get

80
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,699
interesting stuff the problem with a lot

81
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,420
of the Mexican backseat is that it would

82
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,079
have intersex issues outside even

83
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,179
um

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,580
I I don't know I think it was just part

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,379
of the genetics so that

86
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,300
um you know the first time I grew it was

87
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,518
lightly seated and then the next year it

88
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,319
was lightly seated and

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,900
um I'd occasionally come across some

90
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,699
plants that didn't have any intersex

91
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,300
issues and

92
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,979
um you know back then

93
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,080
seeds you know you couldn't find seeds

94
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,598
without ordering them from Amsterdam

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,260
which seemed very sketchy at the time

96
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,780
yeah um so you know pretty early on I

97
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:56,239
was trying to select four plants that I

98
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,239
could grow and have Cincinnati

99
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,060
in terms of like the resources that you

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,280
had and in terms of information like how

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,560
much did you know about the plant at

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,479
that point like did you uh know

103
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,219
immediately to look look out for males

104
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,798
like that kind of thing

105
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,620
uh yeah you know I had a little bit of

106
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,500
you know kind of Stoner Knowledge from

107
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,100
people that had tried to grow

108
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,860
um

109
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,400
I did have people in my family that grew

110
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,400
but I was a little young for anybody to

111
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,439
really share information with me or take

112
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:36,060
me under their wing you know so I kind

113
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,879
of had I had a Baseline and luckily I

114
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,939
was trying outdoor

115
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,418
um so you know I didn't have to worry

116
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:47,759
about time uh you know time light cycles

117
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,978
and all of that I just kind of let it do

118
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,100
its thing and uh tried to finish it

119
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,860
outside how cool are your parents with

120
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,960
you doing all this

121
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:01,979
uh not cool but

122
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:04,319
um you know when when I was a teenager

123
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,360
they kind of had a messy split up so it

124
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,019
was kind of like I could get away with a

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,379
lot of [ __ ] perfect timing yeah yeah and

126
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:17,698
it was kind of at that age for me so I I

127
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:20,279
started with Gorilla growing and and

128
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:23,220
um didn't really do anything outdoor

129
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,638
until I moved out or didn't do anything

130
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,340
indoor until I moved out right when I

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,900
was able to 18 years old and you know I

132
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,839
wanted to get an apartment so that I

133
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,519
could blow it up and grow indoor that's

134
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,978
the reason you wanted to move out not

135
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,859
like to yeah that was your buddies

136
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:42,439
no that was my number one motivation

137
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,819
that's awesome

138
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,959
I knew what you wanted to do for a

139
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,839
career

140
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,519
yeah yeah pretty early on what I wanted

141
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,138
to do

142
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,599
would you tell us a little bit about

143
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,220
what some of those gorilla Growers would

144
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,300
like

145
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:04,500
yeah so uh early on it was

146
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,680
pretty much just you know I I'd get some

147
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,100
dry amendments back then you know stuff

148
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,800
that was readily available chicken [ __ ]

149
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,020
um of course I would line it I'd get

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,280
blood meal bone meal cut meal all that

151
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,139
stuff anything I could get at the feed

152
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,079
store without having to go to the city

153
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,400
to the Hydra store and being sketchy

154
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,180
yeah I would get that I would dig

155
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,659
um

156
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,319
I would take a couple 15 gallon planters

157
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,139
that we had I would dig holes

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,699
um normally I'd try to do at least you

159
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,699
know 30 gallon holes

160
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,978
and I would get all the soil out have a

161
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,538
tarp mix it up with dry amendments put

162
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:47,279
it back

163
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,860
um didn't add anything for aeration

164
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,799
didn't really know anything about that

165
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,538
um but I knew that you know I needed

166
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,259
very fertile soil to make anything

167
00:06:54,538 --> 00:07:00,478
happen so I would you know I would use

168
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,280
the native soil and just add dry

169
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,459
amendments until I thought it was good

170
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,459
enough

171
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:10,680
so very little inputs

172
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,740
um I tried I always tried

173
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,360
because I I wasn't one to run any sort

174
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,579
of irrigation or anything like that all

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,060
of my grill grows over the years I've

176
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:24,000
tried to do in areas where I had easy

177
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,879
access to water so

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,819
um you know narrow river near a pond

179
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,159
near a lake something like that

180
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,900
um that because I always I always toted

181
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,419
it so it was

182
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:40,978
whatever would be the least work

183
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:43,258
while being somewhat discreet

184
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:46,019
I had never really thought much about

185
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,819
like the Gorilla growing aspect and and

186
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,379
not wanting to go to hydro stores and a

187
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,300
lot of Outlaw States

188
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,159
um but it would make sense why you would

189
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,478
have grown up like learning the organic

190
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,400
amendments and all that stuff versus

191
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,519
having to go risk your ass or your face

192
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,839
at a hydro store you know take multiple

193
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,339
cars on your way back yeah yeah I mean

194
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,560
well yeah it was just it was what was

195
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,478
available at the time I could either you

196
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,660
know I could get Miracle Grow or I could

197
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:15,000
get dry amendments and do it like I was

198
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,520
you know trying to grow a bad estimated

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,259
plant around me a lot of people grow

200
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,478
tomatoes you know my family did that

201
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,060
growing up and it was kind of a similar

202
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,978
technique that I was using

203
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,720
do you prefer to make like cherry

204
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:33,360
tomatoes or heirloom big beefy ones

205
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,560
um dude I have 75 eating those that's

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,560
for eating yeah

207
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,259
probably like a cherry

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,918
tomato

209
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:45,778
same yeah unless I'm doing like a BL if

210
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,559
I'm doing a BLT you know I gotta have a

211
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:53,399
big steak tomato yeah of course

212
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:56,579
so for me like you talk about moving out

213
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,100
how how quickly did you get your hands

214
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,200
on other kinds of genetics

215
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,159
and uh so

216
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,778
I the first couple times I tried to get

217
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,899
seeds

218
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:12,838
um I would I dealt with seed banks that

219
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:16,100
I think I dealt with Mark Emery

220
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,600
um pretty early on sent money to Canada

221
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,339
was you know a hope and a dream and

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,120
didn't get [ __ ]

223
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,779
um

224
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
and had a kind of follow-up

225
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:28,639
um

226
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,060
pretty similar uh I didn't really start

227
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:37,319
getting anything until

228
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:40,099
I went to the Dutch you know or the UK I

229
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,500
I'd get stuff that was reasonably cheap

230
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,959
Nirvana Casey brains that kind of stuff

231
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
a little bit of Scentsy

232
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,958
um

233
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,839
but ordering it through she's direct or

234
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:55,199
one of those you know guys in the UK

235
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,339
yeah so I didn't really

236
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,860
start with that uh until

237
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,220
I moved out and

238
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,240
that was I think

239
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,519
um

240
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,680
what was it gonna say

241
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,259
um yeah that was about when I found

242
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:16,079
overgrow so I kind of had a little bit

243
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:18,958
more knowledge as to what I wanted as

244
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,560
you know what I could finish

245
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,939
um

246
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,219
all of that

247
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,500
and I get you know I'd get cheaper stuff

248
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,540
like Nirvana and Casey's brains from my

249
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,339
outdoor grows and you know if I was

250
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,860
going to do some stuff inside where I

251
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,899
could back up plants I would Splurge a

252
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,039
little bit and get a cheap pack of Cincy

253
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,039
seeds or something

254
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,860
Casey brains for the outdoor win

255
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,240
yeah that that stuff was solid I wish I

256
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,919
still had some

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,019
so yeah I wanted to ask you about that

258
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,479
too because Matt does have a bunch of

259
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,820
questions for you about the forums but

260
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,339
before that I did want to ask out of

261
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,180
these early packs uh what were some of

262
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,180
the highlights that you remember

263
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:03,838
um I liked the KC 36 a lot I did really

264
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,739
well so we're here

265
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,380
um

266
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,680
just good I mean you know looking back

267
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:12,360
on it it was all very Justified uh you

268
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,939
know all the Nirvana stuff seemed like

269
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,539
it was a skunk one cross

270
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,839
um

271
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:20,578
they're they're Urban Poison I did a lot

272
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,260
I really liked

273
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:25,559
um

274
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:27,600
their white rhino I grew a bit indoor

275
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,458
and really liked that uh for the potency

276
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,399
the flavor

277
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:35,039
didn't do much for me with white rhino

278
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,839
White Widow any of those whites

279
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,838
um but the potency was there

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,879
um

281
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:45,659
so that kind of stuff really the first

282
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:48,659
seeds that I grew and I really was kind

283
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:51,480
of head over heels for them were um some

284
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:54,419
free seeds I got from evergrow from

285
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,860
there's a guy jlp that would give away

286
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,979
seeds

287
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,159
um and I grew a bunch of his lines over

288
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,620
the years you know you just be an active

289
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:08,278
member send him a message and he'd send

290
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,459
you some free seeds so he had um

291
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:14,220
he had a couple lines that grew uh Romeo

292
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:16,259
and Juliet was one he had one called

293
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,000
Phoenix Hayes that was like a devil's

294
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,578
Haze Super Silver Haze it was really

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,360
good yeah that was in the um that was in

296
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:26,639
that the the afro pits

297
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,399
um Senegal Haze at the Phoenix oh really

298
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,740
yeah oh cool yeah that was an awesome

299
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,440
plan um yeah I love that

300
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,778
it was um you know

301
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,120
pretty heavy on the Neville's face I

302
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,519
think it was something like

303
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,078
you know Dutch grown got busted and the

304
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,839
seeds were collected and so there were

305
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,479
either Devil's Haze or Neville's crossed

306
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,000
to Super Silver Haze and yeah he he

307
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,440
inbred it from there and um it was just

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,720
there were some phenomenal plans in

309
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,260
those they're bad

310
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,399
tedamore right jlp yep John Lee

311
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,399
pettimore yeah

312
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,099
um

313
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,899
at the forums did you already have did

314
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,839
you already get the name heinlan so how

315
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:14,399
did you come to that name

316
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:17,339
um that name I didn't use it on overgrow

317
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,958
I wasn't as active on overgrow I was

318
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,420
kind of

319
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,099
pretty sketched out by it I had a

320
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:26,219
different handle

321
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,259
um but when I when that went down I kind

322
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,339
of freaked out for a little bit and you

323
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,639
know I thought everybody's getting

324
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,560
busted and all that and then when I

325
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,220
signed up for

326
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,259
I see mag I was

327
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,500
um really into

328
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:45,600
bluegrass music at the time and

329
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,299
um you know the highlands and sound that

330
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,519
was something that you know that's the

331
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,679
way people describe the sound of the

332
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,259
Stanley Brothers which is you know a

333
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,120
kind of first generation bluegrass band

334
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:59,000
from Virginia

335
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,879
and so it's kind of a play on that

336
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,320
that's why I chose it and you know I

337
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,578
don't know in retrospect I probably

338
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,519
could have come up with something cooler

339
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:10,019
but that's uh that's what I got

340
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,639
all right I think that's a great name

341
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,320
it's pretty cool it's pretty [ __ ]

342
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,039
cool

343
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,379
a lot

344
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,360
that's a good story too I forget that

345
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,659
like uh Bluegrass culture a lot of it

346
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,720
stems for Virginia and that Eastern Area

347
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:27,958
yeah there that's uh Southwest Virginia

348
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,259
and um yeah right

349
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,018
yeah Kentucky's the Bluegrass State

350
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,819
um that's where that's where it kind of

351
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,980
all started

352
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,440
um but yeah Kentucky Tennessee Southwest

353
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,440
Virginia North Carolina all that

354
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,379
very cool nice

355
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,940
yeah

356
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,480
Matt did you want to ask about

357
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,860
performance all right so we have uh

358
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,420
we've talked about overgrowth talked

359
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,120
about icy mag are there any other early

360
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,939
forums that you can think of that um

361
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,919
we're kind of influential in your uh uh

362
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,660
Growing Experience or like online

363
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,698
learning experience that we haven't

364
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,620
mentioned

365
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:10,078
uh the only other one

366
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,278
I would say of great significance to me

367
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:16,739
would be mechanical Cabana which

368
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,620
people that

369
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:23,159
um were getting frequently banned from

370
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,839
icmag kind of started going over there I

371
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,299
had a bunch of

372
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,980
friends from the forums that were over

373
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,519
there and they kind of turned me onto it

374
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,980
but that was a smaller Forum but a ton

375
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,799
of knowledge there and people that you

376
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,320
know it didn't have nearly as many you

377
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,899
know 17 year old kids showing up trying

378
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,879
to find weed it was it was Growers

379
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,399
discussing

380
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,159
the real deal you know yeah so that one

381
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,799
was was pretty big for me

382
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,139
um three years uh and then you know

383
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,958
there were there were quite a few other

384
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,839
smaller ones that I was on but

385
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,838
um mechanical band is definitely the the

386
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,180
only one other than I see mag that uh

387
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,820
was a major influence on me

388
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,198
yeah shout out to d man

389
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,240
um yep

390
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,159
so you know I don't know how much you

391
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,860
want to go into this part and it's up to

392
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,259
you I can write it down if not

393
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,199
um I wrote down early friends and allies

394
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,958
on the forums so like early friends

395
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:27,240
people you you met that were influential

396
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,799
to your whatever at the time you know

397
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,459
what I mean like uh

398
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:35,519
anybody stands out early on

399
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,179
uh yeah I had quite a few

400
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,240
um

401
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:43,198
there were a couple local guys I don't

402
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,278
know how active they are nowadays and I

403
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,500
don't know if

404
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:49,320
they would want me

405
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,778
changing their names yeah yeah well you

406
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,019
know there there were a few like um I

407
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:57,179
met a local guy who went by uh stretch

408
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,519
puppy on the forums he was a good friend

409
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,758
of mine we came pretty close and

410
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,279
we shared a lot of genetics and

411
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,860
um you know we both learned quite a bit

412
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,899
from each other we don't have out of it

413
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,619
he was a bit north of me

414
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,919
um

415
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:17,818
he he produced some really cool stuff we

416
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,400
shared a ton of genetics and he uh

417
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:23,459
yeah he was just a cool guy he was he

418
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,240
was blowing it up back then in a area

419
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:29,519
where I probably wouldn't have

420
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,019
that's gangster but he's uh he's the

421
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,160
first guy who showed me the Fairfax

422
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,720
four-way

423
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,500
oh wow

424
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,558
and he was getting bags of it

425
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,099
um but he couldn't

426
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,319
um

427
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,819
you know couldn't get the cut it was it

428
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,599
was held down we didn't know the right

429
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,159
people

430
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,619
and he um

431
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,538
he actually bought

432
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:54,538
um some packs of the Nirvana four-way

433
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:56,279
and he popped a packet and he found a

434
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,960
Dead Ringer of the plant it was

435
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,759
incredible

436
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,038
it um

437
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,038
it was it

438
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,359
was just a phenomenal plant it was very

439
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,879
um

440
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,019
very similar to some of that Rubber City

441
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,039
stuff

442
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,960
from wow um yeah the way the heads work

443
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,779
um the way the heads developed on the

444
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,600
plants um it was it was a hell of a line

445
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,160
I wish I had 10 packs of that you know

446
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,439
um but no kidding

447
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,120
yeah back then it was like oh it's just

448
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,860
Nirvana I'll buy the real thing from

449
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,279
Cincy if I really want to find it either

450
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:34,798
right and it'll always be around forever

451
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,660
yeah yeah now it's not available I've

452
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,679
reached out to them they don't have it

453
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,840
um yeah sucks of course of course of

454
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,519
course right yeah no that's interesting

455
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,678
you mentioned the Fairfax floor where I

456
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,819
know since you uh mentioned it a lot of

457
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,798
people are going to be watching are

458
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,319
going to be the a boys um do you have

459
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:56,279
any uh Recollections of it or

460
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:59,279
remembrances of of how it was back then

461
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,500
I really don't it's uh that was a long

462
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,379
time ago

463
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:07,019
Dude it was just this was this was in

464
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,360
the era where you know most commercially

465
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:13,079
available stuff was beasters

466
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,939
um so it was you know it stood out

467
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,240
because it was

468
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,980
locally grown high quality I would

469
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,460
imagine so

470
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,860
yeah it you know today

471
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,660
it would probably be really cool for me

472
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:29,939
I'd really get into it but it doesn't

473
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,298
seem like something that would be

474
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,840
you know in a dispensary in Denver

475
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:38,519
it's not it's not a modern thing

476
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,379
last I heard they were cleaning the cut

477
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,259
up I wonder where it's at it should be

478
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,140
through that status now

479
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,879
be cool to see you yeah post post uh

480
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,160
hplv

481

yeah I'd love to see it I'd love to you

482
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,558

um you know

492
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,940
how we would see some other stuff from

like the northern part of Virginia

494
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,620
um

495
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,700
since he star I remember that being

496
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:25,319
devastatingly potent the first time I

497
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,080
smoked it and

498
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,038
um you know around that time started

499
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,740

501
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,919
stuff

502
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,340
Sour Diesel in Virginia

503
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:44,399
yeah so you know a lot of a lot of stuff

504
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:48,720
came down it's it's not really that far

505
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:52,740
from New York you know um yeah and

506
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,620
certain markets um like the DC area back

507
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,740
then you know an ounce of salaries it

508
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:02,639
was six hundred dollars so I mean it was

509
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:05,279
it was very very marketable

510
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,620
um and so you know

511
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,418
that started showing up I smoked and was

512
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,298
like holy [ __ ]

513
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:14,460
um and luckily I had

514
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:16,980
made some friends through the forums

515
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,340
that I could source to cut through and

516
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:24,058
um man I yeah I fell in love with that

517
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:26,459
one I bet that's that's a a game changer

518
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:31,399
especially for that era in time

519
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,400
yeah [ __ ] I still smoke it all the time

520
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,460
um there's something that I wanted to

521
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,678
ask you and and it's kind of a little

522
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,679
bit of a tangent but it's in the same

523
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,380
realm what are some of the other old uh

524
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,220
Virginia clones you can think of that

525
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,640
like you'd like to nod to in this uh

526
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,640
episode

527
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:57,240
um there there weren't it wasn't

528
00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:00,538
like out west you know it was very small

529
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,140
Circles of people so there wasn't

530
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:06,538
there wasn't a ton of trading

531
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,840
um you know you'd see

532
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:14,099
the Ganny from Virginia Beach sometimes

533
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,899
um yeah that which there were other

534
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,699
candies in the state that people were

535
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,880
growing there was one in Southwest

536
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,400
Virginia that was incredible

537
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,120
um but you would see stuff like that it

538
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,840
was mostly cuts of Siege lines yeah it

539
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,959
wasn't

540
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:35,038
it wasn't stuff with mysterious Origins

541
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,220
and all of that it was afghanis

542
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:42,119
um there was a servant poison cut in my

543
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,159
area for a while but mostly the cut game

544
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,579
started happening

545
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,799
around the time that you know the price

546
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,699
gouging was going on in Northern

547
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,859
Virginia

548
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,298
um yeah Saturday's a little train wreck

549
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,939
that kind of stuff

550
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,500
was going for insane monies how people

551
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,159
started

552
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,419
um growing that stuff locally and

553
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,580
capturing in pretty much

554
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,200
I can't even imagine seeing train wreck

555
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:08,699
over there for the first time because

556
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
it's so vastly different than a lot of

557
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,120
the weed over there

558
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,839
oh yeah yeah that was

559
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:19,859
that when that hit the area it had you

560
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:24,779
know it was on top for years and that

561
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:27,359
um you know it was mostly import from

562
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:29,339
Northern California and you know the

563
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,119
joke the joke was always what doesn't

564
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:36,178
sell in California it switched East

565
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,459
um so the the quality wasn't there but

566
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,620
it was unmistakably trading rack you

567
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,419
could tell I mean anybody that's grown

568
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:46,798
it could see it

569
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:49,259
um but man if you had if you had a jar

570
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,418
of like really nice well-grown indoor

571
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,279
train wreck and you cracked that you

572
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,059
would [ __ ] blow people's minds back

573
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,819
then oh I bet dude I bet

574
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:03,240
so yeah that was that was cool but it

575
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:04,079
was also you know in that that era

576
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,419
um

577
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,859
you kind of had to watch who you pulled

578
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,780
that [ __ ] out around

579
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:11,579
like um

580
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,619
you know you couldn't go to a party and

581
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:15,839
open a jar of sour these were a train

582
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,339
Wreckers and everybody would be like oh

583
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,319
what is this where where did you get

584
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:24,658
this you know yeah it was so yeah it was

585
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,579
yeah it was kind of weird cool guy to

586
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,679
Mark real fast

587
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:30,538
yeah so

588
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,340
um you know it was

589
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,720
it was like when you're going out to the

590
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,000
party or hang out with some friends you

591
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,558
grab a bag of shitty weed that you

592
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,940
bought off somebody just to keep a low

593
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:42,418
profile

594
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,298
it was bad yeah that sucks

595
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,299
yeah you can't even flash a good [ __ ] in

596
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:51,679
front of the chicks well you know you

597
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:55,558
could but yeah yeah

598
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,500
sure yeah for sure for sure so um you

599
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:00,538
know you had to be reserved to make it

600
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,200
yeah

601
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:04,019
um

602
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,240
to make it through the drug war

603
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:10,440
yeah and it was great power comes great

604
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,700
responsibility huh exactly yeah chicks

605
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,558
are always the first way dudes get

606
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,720
caught anyways now that I think about it

607
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:18,859
so yeah that makes a lot of sense

608
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,860
yeah yeah

609
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,320
um Matt you had a note here about the

610
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,699
infamous chem 101 thread on I see yes

611
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,918
all right

612
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,940
um yeah so can we talk about like some

613
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,000
of your

614
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,220
um your first experiences with even

615
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,778
hearing of Cam what what started that

616
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,759
journey into trying to track down the

617
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:41,278
history because like a lot if people

618
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,038
aren't aware like some of my first

619
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,980
intros into reading on the forums about

620
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:49,500
like digging into a history was like the

621
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,079
chem 101 thread for me so it's pretty

622
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,839
important in my learning and overall how

623
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:58,079
we ended up here at this point overall

624
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:01,798
so what what put you on that Journey

625
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:04,678
uh so at that time

626
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,418
um you know I had sourdes a witch there

627
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,380
were various theories floating around

628
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:14,580
about how that was related to uh Kim dog

629
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:17,159
yeah um I had a you know Kim dog bag

630
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,839
seed cross that I was growing that was

631
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,960
you know pretty

632
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,579
pretty close to

633
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,519
um you know what a lot of people know is

634
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:27,119
like a TMD hybrid now yeah

635
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,220
um

636
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,278
so I I was trying

637
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,839
even pretty much from the jump with Jim

638
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,259
dog online there was a ton of

639
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,699
misinformation a ton of people trying to

640
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:42,298
you know

641
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,759
get credit for it so yeah I

642
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,619
I started trying to compile what

643
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,619
information was available

644
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:50,459
talk to the people that were closest to

645
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:52,319
you know

646
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,840
through the whole thing the Kim Fam guys

647
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:59,099
I guess it would be called now yeah um

648
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,759
and try to get kind of a straightforward

649
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,219
um

650
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,460
you know just a breakdown of the family

651
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,278
and and how it was all together and I

652
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,079
was you know I was looking at this [ __ ]

653
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,179
researching and talking to people every

654
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,678
night and I was like well [ __ ] you know

655
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,720
if I'm doing all this I might as well

656
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,759
put it down so the next guy that wants

657
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,519
to know what the [ __ ] going on can you

658
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:24,538
look it up and figure it out

659
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,319
um So after talking to various people

660
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:28,200
um

661
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,720
you know at a time on the Forum you

662
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,620
could talk to Joe brand you could talk

663
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,860
to

664
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:36,839
Peabody Kim dog Greg was on there

665
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,240
um who else

666
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,099
JJ was on there yeah a bunch of people

667

668
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,798
um you know relevant in that world were

669
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:50,579
there to to discuss so

670
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:54,058
I basically took the information

671
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:56,278
as best I could and and put it together

672
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:59,519
you know looking back on it there are

673
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:02,220
definitely some flaws in it um but at

674
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,400
the time it was the information that was

675
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,400
available as well as I could present it

676
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,038
I mean it's like it really is still the

677
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,860
best information as anybody could

678
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,778
present it as given by the people who

679
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:19,199
told it

680
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:21,419
yeah sure it's accurate to that to that

681
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,640
extent and that's that's probably the

682
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,700
most important part I think

683
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,640
yeah yeah it was um

684
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,038
it was it was a cool thread I you know I

685
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,500
talked to inspector a bunch about it and

686
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:37,200
I remember I when I posted it you know

687
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,480
he came on and I think his first post on

688
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,278
the thread was you know if you're gonna

689
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,720
talk about Kim 91 you ought to have a

690
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:47,519
picture of the real one and he posted

691
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,179
because the picture that I had used was

692
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,038
from Joe Joe brand and it wasn't it

693
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,600
wasn't kim91

694
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,879
um but at that time

695
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,759
at that time I had no experience with it

696
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,380
it was still sure a very tightly held

697
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:06,538
cut so um you know a forever right well

698
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,700
I mean and Joe brand was the source of

699
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:10,619
the seed so like him posting a picture

700
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,679
at chem 91 you would assume would be a

701
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:16,259
great source for the picture you know

702
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,059
yeah I mean yeah at that time that was

703
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:21,359
yeah that's straight from the horse's

704
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:23,158
mouth you know yeah exactly no I it's

705
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,898
always fascinated me to know what puts

706
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,440
you on that Journey because it's it's a

707
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:30,058
lot of how we ended up like even here at

708
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,159
this point discussing this kind of stuff

709
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:34,678
together now so it's pretty cool yeah

710
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,659
and and it's still

711
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,620
yeah yeah

712
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:42,480
for someone to come in like me in what

713
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:45,000
2019 2020 and to go and look at that

714
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,919
thread is still really remarkable

715
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,960
um yeah and the number of you know like

716
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,399
people who are now very notable figures

717
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,679
in the community

718
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,658
um that were in that participating like

719
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,200
that that's kind of amazing

720
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,299
yeah it was it was a uh it was a smaller

721
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,179
world back then

722
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:05,398
yeah and it's still the best place to go

723
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:08,940
look at all the pictures is like the one

724
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:11,158
through four two yeah absolutely hard to

725
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,679
find pictures of anywhere uh at least

726
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:17,159
the one yeah that was um yeah that was

727
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,679
right after uh inspector had run them

728
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,559
all and so he had pictures that he let

729
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,500
me use for the thread and um yeah it was

730
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,658
it was pretty remarkable I'm still

731
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,880
kind of bummed I never got to try the

732
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,340
two and the three but uh you know yeah

733
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,559
what are you gonna do

734
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:36,839
the two the two has always interested me

735
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,819
because it's it's blood structure being

736
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,220
so uniquely different than all of them

737
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:44,220
you know little tiny budlets as opposed

738
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,558
to yeah everything else I don't know it

739
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,179
just always seemed more unique than the

740
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:53,879
rest yeah it was but um I remember

741
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:57,240
uh inspector did he crossed them all to

742
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,179
deep chunk and yeah chrome chrome ran

743
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,500
out the chem two deep jump and there was

744
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,980
a plant in there

745
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:10,079
there was like strikingly similar to Kim

746
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:12,000
91. oh wow yeah it it at least visually

747
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,819
and that kind of always

748
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,759
you know I just I've always thought

749
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:20,480
about that I know man wish you could

750
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,480
have gotten those to pop

751
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:28,500
is this a good time for us to also ask

752
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,719
you about what you might consider your

753
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,058
first breeding projects like actual

754
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,940
breeding projects is does that happen in

755
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,379
a similar time to the thread

756
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:43,259
um well you know

757
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:45,539
really I've always kind of done it um

758
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,440
I I've messed with reading different

759
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:50,759
Mexicans trying to get away from

760
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,980
hermaphroditic plants

761
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,839
um pretty much

762
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,700
the second year I was growing it was

763
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,339
something that I always kind of messed

764
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,200
with has found the mail that seems solid

765
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:05,819
I would I would save it

766
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,740
um I never had any intentions in into

767
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,778
really getting into breeding it was

768
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,700
always just kind of something that came

769
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:13,798
with the territory for somebody that was

770
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,399
obsessed with with weed

771
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,158
um

772
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:21,000
and really the

773
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:23,460
the first thing of note I did was

774
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,339
um you know this stuff was praise dog

775
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,960
and I passed it to some friends that I

776
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:30,418
traded seeds with back then you know

777
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,460
Bodie and I talked a lot on the forums

778
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,538
there were several other people 40

779
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,298
credit

780
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:38,759
um you know a bunch of guys that I

781
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:42,000
I would just swap some seeds with and

782
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,038
you know [ __ ] along and uh that was

783
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,859
the first

784
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:49,379
um the first thing of note that I ever

785
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,819
did before that it was mostly just kind

786
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,679
of

787
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:55,439
um you know I'm gonna cross this Mexican

788
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,240
to this Phoenix Haze or I'm going to

789
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,798
cross this Mexican to this other one and

790
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,159
try to get

791
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,538
rid of the hermaphrodite you know but

792
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,299
um yeah I would say that's the first

793
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:08,759
thing of note that I I really did

794
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,980
what all did you do with the trade-off

795
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,480
or I'm sorry yeah trade on

796
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,220
uh so

797
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:21,960
at that time I had a pretty good

798
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:25,319
um stable cuts and I was growing

799
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,899
um growing the seeds from JJ

800
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:30,898
um he and I had traded some stuff and I

801
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:32,459
had some of those seeds I was growing

802
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:33,058
some of his

803
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,058
um

804
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:38,099
Nigerian silver that cross I was growing

805
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:42,778
a few a few different things at the time

806
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:44,759
and um I found a male in Trace talk that

807
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:47,278
I was really impressed with I was

808
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,558
impressed with you know the structure of

809
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,898
it the bigger the

810
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,839
um you know Kim he can be kind of floppy

811
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:56,398
but it was had a really nice rigid

812
00:33:54,839 --> 00:34:00,599
structure

813
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:04,739
um and so I I kept it and

814
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:08,398
um there were a number of plants that I

815
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:12,719
really liked but they were missing

816
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,980
certain things so I basically just hit

817
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,898
you know

818
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,800
hit some plants with it I hit Green

819
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:23,519
Crack I hit purple Oracle I hit

820
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,899
um the Kim D and Kim four that I had I

821
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,039
hit

822
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:29,159
um

823
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,199
abusive as you Kush I had an Acapulco

824
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,780
Gold that I hit

825
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:37,138
um just kind of a mix a mixture of stuff

826
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,260
and I pretty much gave all the seeds

827
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:42,000
away I kept a few for myself but mostly

828
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,040
it was just you know

829
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,398
just giving them to my friends

830
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:53,820
so for clarity here what is the Tres dog

831
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:55,259
that is a Tim Dog d uh bx2 to JJ NYC

832
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,080
made

833
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,540
um and I'm not sure

834
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,119
if it was I don't know if the Original

835
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,400
Seed line was released

836
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,960
um because this was before top dog

837
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,200
launched

838
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,659
um I'm not sure if he I know he released

839
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,399
an in-cross of it later but I believe

840
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:17,578
when he

841
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,099
um you know started his company it was a

842
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:22,079
star dog is what kind of launched

843
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,220
launched the Tim lines if I'm not

844
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,000
mistaken

845
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,139
how so what mail did he use for the

846
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,858
president

847
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:32,960
it was a

848
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:36,779
sincere

849
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:41,460
yep yeah that was the outcross yeah yeah

850
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:44,280
so he used the Afghan one and then uh

851
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,460
and then rest pretty much copied him and

852
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,180
used the Scentsy Hindu Kush

853
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,199
um

854
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:54,838
but JJ was the the first one to have a

855
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:57,480
TMT type c line

856
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,820
you know that like going back I got to

857
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,039
give him props on knowing to use Afghani

858
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,960
one or or a type of plant like that to

859
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,838
that cross sorry it's using a back cross

860
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,820
like that like yeah looking back at how

861
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:10,440
many people have made epic fails of bat

862
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,838
crosses like that's actually probably a

863
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,838
pretty good choice to use in that

864
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:19,199
yeah he um he did a great job with it I

865
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:22,679
you know I had that male plant that I

866
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:25,379
kept for a little bit and then I had a

867
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,960
female from it that was phenomenal as

868
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,780
well it was like a um

869
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,139
it was like a it had the kimdi potency

870
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:37,619
but it was a little bit creamier like um

871
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:41,519
it it's most reminiscent to me of like

872
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:43,680
if you grow TMD outside

873
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,599
um okay it's still it's still really

874
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,000
funky but it has this kind of sweet

875
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,220
creaminess to it especially as it starts

876
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,199
to occur pure a little bit

877
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:54,299
um and that

878
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,779
that came through pretty strong on the

879
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,780
trace dogs

880
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,440
um but yeah it was a it was a great line

881
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,019
I

882
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,539
um I hit it to a bunch of stuff

883
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:09,659
and uh yeah some of it got kind of

884
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,639
popular yeah the dogs Waltz uh notably

885
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:13,739
the poodle nuts cut now that was found

886
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:16,858
by 40 Grit

887
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:17,879
yeah 40 grit 40 ounce grown nut he had a

888
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,779
bunch of names

889
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,338
um yeah

890
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:25,260
on the forums he so he was

891
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,219
um a good buddy of mine that I met

892
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,920
through

893
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:31,259
yeah either overgrow or I see nag and he

894
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,079
he was like the first dude that was like

895
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,900
blowing up warehouses and posting

896
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,420
pictures of it he was growing you know a

897
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,760
warehouse of Urkel in the Bay Area and

898
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,519
just you know crushing it his

899
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,800
his Oracle was the best that I ever

900
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,838
smoked it was incredible

901
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,079
um he just nailed it but you know he was

902
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:55,078
always looking for for something that

903
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,660
grew faster because you know that if

904
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,940
you're doing lights and lights of Urkel

905
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:01,500
you know your veg time is for [ __ ]

906
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,900
ever

907
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,820
um so when I was

908
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,440
um you know when I was making this seeds

909
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,820
I had an Urkel and I was like you know

910
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,480
what I'm gonna pollinate that one just

911
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,000
for just for my boy 40. and so yeah I

912
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,400
sent I sent him a bunch of seeds and he

913
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,159
popped them and uh yeah he found that

914
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,740
cut that he called the poodle nuts

915
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,338
and uh it still floats around

916
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:28,858
yeah I I remember my first encounter

917
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,539
with that was with uh a bunch of the

918
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:32,519
Colorado people I noticed it getting

919
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:34,380
really big in Denver when the Denver

920
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:37,980
medical scene came on

921
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:41,039
and I know um what's his name uh Tiara

922
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,480
Rojo Phil filthier Rojo he was blowing

923
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,920
it up with that thing and that's when I

924
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,559
was like God what is this because it was

925
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,720
super unique looking and like to me it's

926
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,400
uh and he'll probably hate that I say

927
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,838
this but it reminds me of like something

928
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,960
as unique

929
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,179
and different looking as cookies would

930
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,920
have been at the same time like looking

931
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,618
at them how different they both look

932
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,240
from normal standard butt around it

933
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,880
could have easily caught on the hype of

934
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:07,500
that in my opinion and you know like it

935
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,420
was almost going in that direction in

936
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,940
Denver it just never quite got the

937
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,039
cookie smash yeah it was unique

938
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,440
yeah yeah there were there were several

939
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,699
guys in Denver that grew it it still has

940
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,500
um

941
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:20,460
still has a pretty good reputation there

942
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,820
I actually

943
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:26,880
um I went to a dispensary here a year or

944
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,519
two ago and um I was meeting a friend

945
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,079
that ran the dispensary and he was

946
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,940
telling the people in the shop I mean

947
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,880
this is the guy that did dogs Waltz and

948
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:41,039
they were all like oh man you know that

949
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,039
was I was like damn man yeah

950
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,199
I've got two questions here so just to

951
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,420
be clear that the dogs Waltz is Urkel by

952
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:51,480
Tres dog is that right yes

953
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,039
okay and would this be would you

954
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,199
consider this the moment where you were

955
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,440
starting to get exposure for the first

956
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,439
time

957
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,740
um

958
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,358
no I wouldn't say that because it was

959
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,838
still you know

960
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,279
it was Forum exposure it wasn't like it

961
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,239
was

962
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,780
um

963
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,879
it wasn't like it was winning a cup or

964
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,820
anything like that it was you know the

965
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,559
people that I already knew and respected

966
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,260
saw that I made something that was cool

967
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,599
so it was more like it was more like

968
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,420
just getting getting the respect of my

969
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,960
peers and people that I looked up to

970
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,200
um yeah yeah the the moment that I kind

971
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,480
of I guess

972
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,980
became Infamous in the in the Cannabis

973
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,858
world was

974
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,960
um when 30 started using the Appalachian

975
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,940
stuff

976
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,760
is it time for us to talk about the

977
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,400
Appalachia I mean even the name I mean

978
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,740
we uh there might be one thing before

979
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:58,139
that and I you can correct me if I'm

980
00:40:52,739 --> 00:41:02,519
wrong but the skunk magazine sub cool

981
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:05,940
um retraction was that Appalachia

982
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:10,980
uh yeah the when he published the Kim

983
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:13,320
101 in Skunk magazine yes yeah that was

984
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,900
um that was kind of wild to me because

985
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,680
you know at the time I was just a dude

986
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,500
that

987
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:21,899
had a couple whites in his house and did

988
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,659
some gorilla grows and you know just

989
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:27,480
some dude and I'd go to the bookstore

990
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:29,519
and pick up the weed magazines every

991
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,539
once in a while because you know I

992
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,599
wasn't getting that [ __ ] in the mail

993
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:35,759
yeah and that's it I've hooked it up one

994
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,820
day and started reading it and I was

995
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,400
like God damn this is word for word my

996
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,099
thread for my city mag that's kind of

997
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:48,059
[ __ ] up and you know

998
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:51,359
I I wasn't the biggest fan of him anyway

999
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:52,799
so yeah you know it kind of rubbed me

1000
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,219
wrong

1001
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,440
um so I I remember looking up the email

1002
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,000
for them and I emailed them and linked

1003
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,000
them to the thread

1004
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,800
and they were of course super apologetic

1005
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,079
and they were like we're gonna dock him

1006
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,099
on the next article and we're gonna send

1007
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,320
you

1008
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,160
the amount and it was it was something

1009
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,800
ridiculous it was like more

1010
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:19,199
uh it was more for just getting it

1011
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,660
corrected I think yeah I think they they

1012
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,039
sent me a check for like 70 bucks or

1013
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:25,039
something that I never yes

1014
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,980
but it was more for like you know peace

1015
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,480
of mind I guess I had to frame that [ __ ]

1016
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,820
you know I was just thinking I don't

1017
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,719
know whatever happened to it

1018
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,920
um but yeah I probably should have yeah

1019
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,779
that's funny

1020
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,858
um artifact to find if you have yeah

1021
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,260
right

1022
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:47,759
yeah yeah I have no idea where that

1023
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,579
would be

1024
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,440
and then there's another one that that I

1025
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:55,440
know CSI would want me to bring up

1026
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,440
before we move on and I think that

1027
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
before Appalachia and that's the the

1028
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,420
infamous icy mag Banning of high and

1029
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,939
Lonesome where like

1030
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,680
everybody kind of decided they were

1031
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,500
going to start pulling their threads and

1032
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:14,639
[ __ ] because they banned you

1033
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:18,960
um yeah I got bands I can't remember

1034
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:21,118
it might have been in the gym 101 thread

1035
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,940
um but basically it was

1036
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,880
having a bit of a back and forth with

1037
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,519
old res dog

1038
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,260
I see Mac and this you know

1039
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,079
this wasn't even

1040
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,359
you know this was pretty

1041
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,280
government informant rest dog this was

1042
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:41,059
just you know he's a he's a giant

1043
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,859
[ __ ] and yeah yeah

1044
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:47,699
so so you know I had a couple back and

1045
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:50,159
forths with him on the forums and that

1046
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:52,739
was you know JFC Nirvana's number one

1047
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,139
Cash Cow so

1048
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,379
basically if you talk [ __ ] to him you

1049
00:43:55,139 --> 00:44:01,078
got yanked and he was just an arrogant

1050
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,660
prick and as far as I can tell he still

1051
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,680
is but you know now he's also

1052
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:09,480
they confirmed rat so you know

1053
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,818
I

1054
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,800
I would get banned again over that [ __ ]

1055
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:16,318
whatever

1056
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,060
so the the rest of the story goes that

1057
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,219
everybody else on not everybody

1058
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:23,279
obviously but a bunch of the respected

1059
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:25,019
guys on icy mag including CSI who had

1060
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,300
you know hundreds and hundreds of pages

1061
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:29,420
of amazing Growers up there just started

1062
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,280
deleting them

1063
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,079
to try to get you back you know it

1064
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,720
worked eventually didn't it

1065
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,280
uh no I had to I waited a while and then

1066
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,559
I was like [ __ ] it I'm gonna sign back

1067
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,980
up and I signed back up and they banned

1068
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,039
me and then I I I eventually did it

1069
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,139
again just to see and I think I still

1070
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,440
currently have an account there

1071
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:55,019
uh I never never used it but

1072
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,059
they always got me bro they always got

1073
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:58,800
me but I always had riot in the name

1074
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:02,519
somewhere you know

1075
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,980
yeah yeah and you know it was it was a

1076
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:07,500
marketing thing it was it was how he

1077
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,960
sold seeds and if you [ __ ] with his

1078
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,358
money you were gone

1079
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,240
that tended to be most of the the the

1080
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:17,759
the way with forums though like most

1081
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,858
forums seem to have some sort of seed

1082
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,020
bank eventually connected to it and then

1083
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:24,059
you know they had their top dog and if

1084
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:26,699
you messed with that then there was an

1085
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:28,199
issue here almost always yeah it was

1086
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:30,000
always fun and that's

1087
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:33,000
and that's the reason a lot of people

1088
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,858
like CSI and myself and

1089
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,079
um many others kind of went to the

1090
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:41,098
Canada Cabana because it was yeah it

1091
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,900
wasn't a it wasn't a seed banks Forum

1092
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:43,920
you could kind of discuss what you

1093
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,639
wanted

1094
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,519
um

1095
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,739
just without a lot of the politics yeah

1096
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,179
yeah the command is cool

1097
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,939
yeah

1098
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:55,318
all right I think now we can head in if

1099
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,639
you want

1100
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:58,739
sure

1101
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,219
um I did have one last thing on the

1102
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:06,239
forums which is in 2023 are there forums

1103
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:09,838
that are still relevant in like to you

1104
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:13,739
um there's good information on I see mag

1105
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:16,440
still it's um it's difficult because

1106
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:17,759
as people got banned a couple things

1107
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,679
would happen

1108
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,140
um they would either have their post

1109
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:25,318
left up without their name on it so it

1110
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:28,400
just says yes so uh on some of those

1111
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:30,779
older threads you don't really know

1112
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,838
whose comments you're reading you don't

1113
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,040
know whether to put a lot of weight into

1114
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,659
them

1115
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,119
um they

1116
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:41,098
they there is a good amount of relevant

1117
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,358
information there

1118
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,818
um it's

1119
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:46,440
it's a bit Antiquated at this point it's

1120
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:49,559
a lot of you know

1121
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,260
a lot of guys that are doing [ __ ] in

1122
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,019
illegal States wiring up you know a

1123
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,000
couple

1124
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:59,460
250 watt HDs lights or something it's a

1125
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,338
lot of you know as a home grower I think

1126
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,838
it has a lot a lot of good material but

1127
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:06,838
if you're um

1128
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,639
if you're doing anything big it's pretty

1129
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,519
antiquated

1130
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,879
yep that sounds better um

1131
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,579
and then I don't know I haven't I

1132
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,599
haven't checked out a lot of the others

1133
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,359
um

1134
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,099
mechanic event is still around I know

1135
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,699
like roll it up is still around I

1136
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,420
haven't I've I went on there to

1137
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,358
um

1138
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:32,099
follow a thread uh where somebody was

1139
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:33,960
growing some of my stuff and it was

1140
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,700
pretty cool but you know I'm not active

1141
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,139
on any of them I

1142
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:42,419
I don't have a ton of extra time like I

1143
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:46,379
did when I was younger

1144
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,539
yep yep okay well I I think we can segue

1145
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,119
it now to the Appalachia

1146
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:54,119
um Okay so

1147
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,980
from the time that you first made the

1148
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,980
cross like how long has it been

1149
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,019
um

1150
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,280
it was 2007 when I made it so it has

1151
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:10,460
been

1152
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,460
what 16 years wow yeah

1153
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:15,838
yeah so it's you know for me

1154
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:17,460
a lot of people are really excited about

1155
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,519
it but for me it's like it's something

1156
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,800
that I made and I pretty much grown it

1157
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:26,519
ever since then

1158
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,318
um it does really well and multiple

1159
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:29,460
applications for me so it's something

1160
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,739
you know

1161
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,800
does well outside does well enough

1162
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:37,379
Greenhouse does well indoor so I've kind

1163
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,260
of always always done it

1164
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,420
um and I'll usually make seeds with it

1165
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,420
most of them just kind of hang out in my

1166
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,019
fridge until I it's awesome or something

1167
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,000
um

1168
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:50,099
but yeah it's

1169
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,719
it's an older line but it's it's a good

1170
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:54,480
one

1171
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,279
I want to ask you about maybe what you

1172
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,019
perceive to be the different stages that

1173
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,839
project's been through but just before

1174
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:02,338
that I want to ask about the name you

1175
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:03,838
know why did you call it Appalachia I

1176
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:07,619
know you already talked about how high

1177
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:10,380
in Lonesome is drawn from bluegrass

1178
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:13,920
um yeah Appalachia tell us about that

1179
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:18,900
uh really it was because

1180
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,338
I was hoping to find something that was

1181
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,139
um

1182
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:26,159
a little more solid for what I wanted

1183
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:28,679
outdoor and that's a time I was doing my

1184
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,279
outdoor grows in that region so I was

1185
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:33,598
kind of hoping for something that was

1186
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,260
regionally appropriate

1187
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,500
um

1188
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,020
a lot of the stuff that was popular on

1189
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,358
the west coast and popular in you know

1190
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:45,300
Spain or places like that didn't really

1191
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:47,400
cross over we have a different climate

1192
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,180
we have a lot more humidity

1193
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,639
um

1194
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:52,679
earlier Frost than a lot of places so a

1195
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,618
lot of the stuff that was marketed for

1196
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,639
outdoor wasn't really well suited to the

1197
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:58,380
area

1198
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,858
so I kind of just

1199
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:05,099
uh called it Appalachia because Green

1200
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:07,679
Crack was one that I grew a lot outside

1201
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:10,200
and

1202
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,960
that I was hoping to improve it with the

1203
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,179
trace dog Green Crack has some issues

1204
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,960
outside it

1205
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:22,739
if you let it go to where I like it you

1206
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,539
know it's it likes to rot it's it's a

1207
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:26,699
very fast plant though so you can get

1208
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:28,980
away with it by by taking it early it

1209
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:31,259
triggers pretty early here

1210
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,719
um and you can get it eight weeks

1211
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,720
without any issues I like to take it 10

1212
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:40,379
weeks and man if you leave it out out

1213
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,939
here that long it's you know it's you're

1214
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,818
losing half of it

1215
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,920
can you um first for like an indoor

1216
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:49,199
idiot like me can you explain what

1217
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,760
triggers early means because I know it

1218
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,259
took me years to figure out what that

1219
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,440
even meant

1220
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:57,300
yeah so as you know after the solstice

1221
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,679
the days start to get shorter and

1222
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,519
shorter

1223
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,960
um most stuff outdoor doesn't wait until

1224
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:07,440
it's

1225
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:10,260
actual daylight equivalent to flip if it

1226
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,380
did that everything would flip in

1227
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,780
September here so um as it is as the

1228
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,519
days get shorter and shorter

1229
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,200
um you know some stuff will start

1230
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,659
flowering at

1231
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:24,419
14 hours of daylight some stuff will

1232
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:27,598
start flowering at 13 hours of daylight

1233
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,940
you know if you have it if you have it

1234
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,099
where it only gets Morning Sun it might

1235
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,858
trigger a little bit earlier

1236
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:36,838
um so that's always been

1237
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:39,420
especially with messing with different

1238
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:40,679
cuts outside you know there's some stuff

1239
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,139
that was

1240
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,719
amazing indoor but you take it outdoor

1241
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:48,058
and it triggers at the end of August and

1242
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:50,879
you can't finish it right here

1243
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:54,180
um Green Crack triggers pretty early

1244
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:58,318
um consistently so it was it was a good

1245
00:51:54,179 --> 00:52:00,659
candidate to work with for my scene

1246
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:04,079
yeah I knew we liked it outdoors in San

1247
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:06,960
Diego a lot too uh mostly yeah outdoor

1248
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,940
experiences green crack and yeah Casey's

1249
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,838
brains and green crack for the most part

1250
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,519
yeah

1251
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,799
yeah

1252
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:15,179
okay yeah so that's awesome so those

1253
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,519
were some of your initial considerations

1254
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:19,440
when you made the cross

1255
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,420
um would you be able to take us through

1256
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,700
the Journey of like

1257
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:27,240
where appalachia's been from you know

1258
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:29,039
from the early days uh with Bodhi and to

1259
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:31,500
where it is now

1260
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:35,400
uh yeah so

1261
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,420
I gave it to Bodie I didn't really know

1262
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,599
um

1263
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,519
what all had come of it I kind of took a

1264
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:46,079
break from

1265
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:48,420
um the forums the late 2000s maybe 2008

1266
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,500
2009 I took a couple years off from it I

1267
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,900
was just kind of

1268
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,940
sick of the politics sick of you know

1269
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:57,838
the big Dickens

1270
00:52:53,940 --> 00:53:00,720
um so I I didn't really know

1271
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,358
what was going on with it I was I was

1272
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,399
growing it outside every year I had a

1273
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,739
couple cuts that I grew inside but

1274
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,000
outdoor I would usually make a few seeds

1275
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:10,279
with it

1276
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,679
um

1277
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,200
basically uh

1278
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,419
kind of uneducated or not uneducated it

1279
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:20,358
just wasn't ever something that

1280
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:23,460
I intended

1281
00:53:20,358 --> 00:53:26,098
for you know a broad audience so it was

1282
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,318
one-to-one breeding I find a male I like

1283
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:30,119
see the lowers on a female I liked and

1284
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:30,838
he disease

1285
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:35,160
um

1286
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:38,099
around I don't know two thousand

1287
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:39,539
I don't know early 2010s

1288
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:42,480
um

1289
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:44,039
Matt was actually on I see mag and sent

1290
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,139
me a message

1291
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:50,099
um saying that

1292
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:52,440
Ken had won the Cannabis Cup with a

1293
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:55,559
renamed appalachicut

1294
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,780
um and I I logged on just to you know

1295
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,980
answer my messages and team up with a

1296
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,540
few people I don't want to lose contact

1297
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:05,338
with and I saw that and you know I hit

1298
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:07,079
up Bodhi about it and we talked about it

1299
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:10,279
and he's like oh man you know I didn't

1300
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,280
want to drag you into the drama

1301
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:20,579
filled me in on it and um you know it

1302
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:23,818
the word got out that it was

1303
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:28,440
um Cody's keeper female apalachian cut

1304
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:31,440
that won the Cannabis Cup as a 11.

1305
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,338
um and around that same time

1306
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,300
um

1307
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:39,420
thought he had made you know a lot of

1308
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:41,160
crosses with it and uh it was it was

1309
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,680
starting to take off so

1310
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:46,199
that's when it was um you know that's

1311
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,919
when it was kind of a big deal

1312
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:50,159
um

1313
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,099
there was a ton of demand for it I you

1314
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,960
know I had some seeds that I was working

1315
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:55,559
with but not a ton

1316
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,880
um

1317
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:02,640
and

1318
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:06,539
uh I think I originally released

1319
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:11,940
the line as an F3

1320
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:15,539
around 2012 through the sea Depot

1321
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,980
um which was you know a European seed

1322
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:21,300
bank that

1323
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:25,818
was stand up until it wasn't yeah um got

1324
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:31,440
released yeah I released those and um

1325
00:55:25,818 --> 00:55:35,338
the sour diesel Appalachian cross

1326
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,900
so at which point with the oh sorry oh

1327
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:39,119
no go ahead

1328
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:43,260
this is gonna ask with the F3

1329
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:46,318
um how were you selecting towards that

1330
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:48,180
um so at that time I was looking for

1331
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,219
basically what I'm looking for now I

1332
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,019
like um

1333
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:56,039
green crack my favorite thing about it

1334
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:59,280
is the flavor the candied mango it's

1335
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:02,159
really good the high is nice if you let

1336
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,280
it go 70 days but if you take it when it

1337
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:08,279
looks done around eight weeks it's it's

1338
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,859
not I mean it's not that good you know

1339
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,319
if you take a 70 it's a nice Buzz it's

1340
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:15,358
good all-time day smoke

1341
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:17,460
um but it doesn't you know

1342
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,199
it doesn't pack a punch it has a pretty

1343
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,818
low ceiling

1344
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:25,439
um but the flavor is I mean you just

1345
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:27,358
want to smoke it constantly yeah so

1346
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,720
um you know my goal with that one has

1347
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:33,358
always been try to get some of the mango

1348
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,980
flavor with the potency

1349
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,199
um which

1350
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,940
you know it's hard to get it all

1351
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,118
together

1352
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:44,818
um but that's that was the goal then

1353
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:49,140
um and that's you know I don't know how

1354
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:50,338
many of those tax got sold

1355
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,980
um

1356
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:55,199
I you know they shut down a few months

1357
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:57,420
after I started dealing with them and

1358
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:58,379
kind of screwed all the Breeders but

1359
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,099
yeah

1360
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,019
um

1361
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:03,599
yeah

1362
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:06,539
but that was that was the goal then and

1363
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,838
um after I you know took my liquids

1364
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:12,300
there I just kind of gave up on

1365
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,699
any kind of ideas with the seed game

1366
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:19,280
because it was too sketchy dealing with

1367
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,279
people in Europe and all that jazz

1368
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:23,940
yeah

1369
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:26,579
um

1370
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:29,460
is it worth talking about

1371
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:33,599
the difference between you working on it

1372
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:36,300
then and your recent releases of it

1373
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,640
uh sure so

1374
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,400
you know working on it then I made those

1375
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:43,500
f3s I didn't use

1376
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,220
a huge pool

1377
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,260
um

1378
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:48,959
to select from then

1379
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:52,980
uh the f2s

1380
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,720
you know it was from Maybe 15 seeds

1381
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,059
something like that

1382
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:59,399
um and

1383
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:01,200
once I got to F3 there were some plants

1384
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,579
I liked but

1385
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:07,679
when I made F force with it it it

1386
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:08,640
lost the mango the mango was pretty much

1387
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:10,980
gone

1388
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:14,279
um you know there was a higher

1389
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,358
percentage of of lands highly resonance

1390
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,579
plants

1391
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,920
um the the resin from Green Crack came

1392
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:21,539
through but it lost the flavor

1393
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,180
the resident of it came through and then

1394
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:26,400
the potency of the trace off but I

1395
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:29,399
couldn't I couldn't get that flavor

1396
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,099
um I I took it to F5

1397
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,680
um see if I could

1398
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:36,960
you know find some but it was you know

1399
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:39,659
more of the same it was it remained a

1400
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:43,260
very vigorous highly resonance plant

1401
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:45,539
with um you know still a good little

1402
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:49,920
range to it um some good highs in there

1403
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:51,358
but it it didn't have the flavor

1404
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,358
um so

1405
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,239
you know after years of

1406
00:58:54,358 --> 00:59:00,179
people asking about it and Matt kind of

1407
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:04,858
getting on me to make some more I um I

1408
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:06,598
went back to the f2s I popped 50 of them

1409
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:09,598
and um

1410
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,940
I found

1411
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,519
um you know several plants that I really

1412
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:16,980
liked in the f2s there were there's a

1413
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:20,039
good bit of mango there were some some

1414
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:23,099
with you know mango and fuel kind of

1415
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:25,940
interplaying and in a unique way

1416
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:31,079
um So to avoid

1417
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:34,318
bottlenecking it I I used a couple males

1418
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,420
and um you know all of my favorite

1419
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,139
females

1420
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,318
um

1421
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:42,058
I grew the females out separately smoked

1422
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,519
on them all and the ones that were

1423
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:47,460
really impressive that had what I

1424
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:50,460
thought I wanted in the line those are

1425
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,500
the ones that um I

1426
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,679
harvested seed from and that's what I

1427
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,679
released

1428
00:59:56,338 --> 01:00:00,960
um did you make a conscious decision

1429
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,838
about whether to do one-to-one as

1430
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,179
opposed to like a group

1431
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:08,338
uh so I

1432
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:10,440
yeah I did make that decision so

1433
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:12,719
initially I was doing one-to-one

1434
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,740
braiding and I think that

1435
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:18,779
works really well for certain things

1436
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:21,598
um the

1437
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:24,000
the thing with Appalachia at the time

1438
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,099
you know was some people wanted it to

1439
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,980
smoke a lot of people wanted it for

1440
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:31,440
hobbyist reading projects

1441
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,358
um and a lot of people had a kind of

1442
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,460
different

1443
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:39,480
um impression of what the line should be

1444
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:42,780
based on Cody's work Cody had a male

1445
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:45,298
that brought a lot of creaminess

1446
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,680
um you know like a creamy Kim

1447
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:47,400
sweetness

1448
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:50,578
um

1449
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,559
to the lines and I didn't want to

1450
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:54,359
completely deviate from that because

1451
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,000
that's what a lot of people you know

1452
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:59,219
fell in love with with the line

1453
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,119
um so I wanted it to I wanted to keep it

1454
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:02,459
open

1455
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:04,440
so that there would be

1456
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:06,619
um a decent variety for people to look

1457
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,619
through

1458
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,960
um

1459
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:12,780
yeah

1460
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:16,139
what I heard there basically is that the

1461
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:17,700
world owes me a favor for getting you to

1462
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:20,879
release seeds so basically it's all me

1463
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:22,439
is what I heard there yeah yeah yeah I

1464
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,318
definitely did want to get into two guys

1465
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,720
one cups but just before that

1466
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:29,338
on either side of the Appalachia like in

1467
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:31,439
this whole journey were there other

1468
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:34,759
notable projects

1469
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,760
um that you'd like to highlight

1470
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:40,140
um

1471
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:41,099
not really I've done a lot of kind of

1472
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:45,420
like

1473
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:46,260
private stuff for my own curiosity and

1474
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,659
um

1475
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,220
I don't know I have I've done a lot of

1476
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:53,940
things that

1477
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:56,039
I'm either not pleased with or they I've

1478
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,200
never got around to testing them I have

1479
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:59,880
I have a lot of crosses I've done but I

1480
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:01,379
never really had the

1481
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,160
the mindset

1482
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,318
um

1483
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,058
to release them commercially so there's

1484
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:08,519
I have a good amount of stuff that I'm

1485
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:11,280
kind of digging back through now

1486
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:14,099
um but no nothing noteworthy that would

1487
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:17,519
mean anything to anybody except me he's

1488
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:20,160
the pickiest person I've ever met it's

1489
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:22,139
crazy how much stuff he's made and or

1490
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,838
like I've talked about in the past like

1491
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:27,838
gone through several generations and

1492
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:29,699
then been like nah I'll go back like

1493
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,858
three steps and then start there again

1494
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:34,259
and go back through it's like that's

1495
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:36,779
tedious I mean it's it's amazing to

1496
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:39,900
watch sure yeah it's amazing to watch

1497
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:42,599
it's it's just not often done you know

1498
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:45,599
because it is

1499
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:49,859
yeah I mean it's um you know

1500
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:51,720
like I have a TMD back cross that I made

1501
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:53,400
um but that's not it's not something

1502
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:55,078
that's ready

1503
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,298
for any kind of

1504
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:00,298
ready for me to let out I've you know I

1505
01:02:57,298 --> 01:03:03,239
recently did some more sativa kind of

1506
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:05,759
stuff but it's um you know

1507
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:07,679
Fury's still out on it I gotta

1508
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,720
I gotta approve of it

1509
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,940
I think um we can come back to some of

1510
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:14,578
your you know current more recent

1511
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,139
experiments and your b-sides uh but

1512
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:17,579
maybe we can't talk about two guys one

1513
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:19,440
cups

1514
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:20,760
at this point

1515
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,240
yeah

1516
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:28,140
um that that was all I mean it pretty

1517
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:30,239
much sent from a joke yeah when uh me

1518
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:32,279
and Matt were talking about you know

1519
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,618
winning cups and not getting credit for

1520
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:37,319
it because the United States were either

1521
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:40,200
renamed or you know just not called out

1522
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:43,380
and I was like man we need to we need to

1523
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:45,598
start a company and call it uh

1524
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:48,200
two guys one cups and I spelled it like

1525
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,200
you know the

1526
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:55,199
um

1527
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:57,659
and really it's um

1528
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,879
from a marketing and branding standpoint

1529
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:02,940
it's a terrible move

1530
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:05,400
um like probably the worst

1531
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:08,460
um worse things ever but it was it was

1532
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:11,519
uh it was just something we were

1533
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:14,639
[ __ ] around with for fun to release

1534
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,619
kind of collaborations

1535
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,480
um yeah we've talked we've talked about

1536
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:20,099
like rebranding and maybe doing it

1537
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,039
seriously

1538
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:25,500
um yeah but but there's some cool stuff

1539
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,779
in their name bro yeah that was such a

1540
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,818
good name too

1541
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,740
yeah why don't people appreciate like

1542
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:37,139
triple on time

1543
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:38,879
yeah yeah it's super witty yeah so what

1544
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:42,618
were your uh what were both of your

1545
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,619
favorites to come out of that collab

1546
01:04:45,858 --> 01:04:51,358
yeah there's two there was the um the

1547
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,059
poodle nuts bloop on it and then the

1548
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:55,500
lupus headband Appalachia and that's it

1549
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:59,819
that's what we've got that that

1550
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:02,159
comprises the total of two guys one cups

1551
01:04:59,818 --> 01:05:04,380
yeah wait how does how do Google nuts

1552
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:07,679
relate to dogs Wellness

1553
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:11,039
it's a cut of it it's the it's the cut

1554
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:13,440
did uh 40 grit found that was kind of

1555
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,659
how it became popular

1556
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,099
yeah yeah yep

1557
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:18,118
cool

1558
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,460
yeah

1559
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:23,160
um but yeah that's that's the extent of

1560
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:27,298
that that work thus far

1561
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:30,739
yeah and maybe under new different names

1562
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,739
new different messes

1563
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:37,919
um I don't know where this one fits in

1564
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:38,940
high in Lonesome but we you and I talked

1565
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,380
about

1566
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,318
um you talking about breeding for

1567
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,700
recessives so where did that appear

1568
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:46,500
in your

1569
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:48,899
yeah timeline

1570
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:52,079
um so I mean that's kind of that was

1571
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,400
kind of like something I dealt with from

1572
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,039
the jump

1573
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:59,760
um in trying to

1574
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:03,239
breed a Mexican plant that didn't have

1575
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:06,059
um her math predicted traits I had um

1576
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:09,419
I was I was pretty I've always kind of

1577
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:10,859
been a geek about all this [ __ ] so when

1578
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,818
I used to get

1579
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:14,519
um

1580
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:16,858
back to Mexican weed I would save the

1581
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:19,380
seeds I would

1582
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:21,960
um label them and I had a system I made

1583
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,838
up it was pretty like over the top

1584
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,179
really thinking back on it but I would

1585
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:29,519
have some notes on it some notes on you

1586
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:32,399
know the quality of the high

1587
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:34,199
from the plants the physical appearance

1588
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,059
appearance without being too harsh

1589
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:39,179
because you know like I said that stuff

1590
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:41,579
was all treated like [ __ ] yeah

1591
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:43,919
and I would you know I would ask for

1592
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:45,798
origin most of the time I couldn't get

1593
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,659
it but you know sometimes it would be

1594
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:50,639
Sinaloa or oh or whatever probably just

1595
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:51,358
whatever that you thought would shut me

1596
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,578
up

1597
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:55,920
um yeah

1598
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:58,200
yeah so I

1599
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,059
but it was good because I could go back

1600
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:01,739
and look at

1601
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:04,440
um you know which ones were my favorite

1602
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:05,818
to smoke and um those would be the seeds

1603
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,519
that I bought

1604
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:10,380
um I'd also go on things like you know

1605
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:12,599
seed maturity if there were a ton of

1606
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,920
white seeds in it I figured you know if

1607
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:18,079
they have problems finishing it in

1608
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,079
Mexico it's pretty [ __ ] for Virginia

1609
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:25,318
but uh so I grew one of those lines and

1610
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,298
um

1611
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:29,818
it was

1612
01:07:27,298 --> 01:07:32,099
you know it was a pretty traditional

1613
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:34,519
kind of Mexican sativa there was a lot

1614
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:37,380
of plants with

1615
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:40,199
in it but I had one plant

1616
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:43,380
um it was like a straight mango and that

1617
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:47,279
Mayo like a cantaloupe Melanie

1618
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:49,260
um you know sweet spice it was a really

1619
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,960
just incredible flavor it was the only

1620
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:54,119
thing I'd really seen like that

1621
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:57,599
um in Mexican weed

1622
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:59,420
um but it it was a full-on intersex

1623
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,920
plant I mean you know you'd have

1624
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:03,599
clusters in the tops you'd have clusters

1625
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,460
everywhere

1626
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,140
um so I crossed I crossed that to

1627
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,740
another

1628
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:11,279
um

1629
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:14,038
another Mexican I had and uh you know

1630
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,660
the next year I grew those out

1631
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:18,600
um they

1632
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:21,059
in the F1 there was a good mix I didn't

1633
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:24,359
find anything that was quite like that

1634
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:27,179
cantaloupe type plant so I made a few

1635
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:28,319
more with my favorite plants and then in

1636
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:31,920
the

1637
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:34,798
um in the F3 of that plant I found quite

1638
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,759
a few that had that cantaloupe Aroma to

1639
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:41,759
them but they all permed

1640
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:46,140
um so that was you know I was trying to

1641
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:48,899
breed for that recessive flavor profile

1642
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:50,699
but in that line that seemed to be

1643
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:52,858
linked to

1644
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:53,460
intersex traits

1645
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:57,539
um

1646
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,140
so that was that was my first

1647
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:01,198
um

1648
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,779
first experience trying to breed for

1649
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,439
recessives failing at it

1650
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,380
um

1651
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:10,798
and then you know I've had several other

1652
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,579
instances with it over the years

1653
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:13,319
um

1654
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:15,420
one project

1655
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,739
it's not even I mean I guess it's a

1656
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:18,779
project because I've been working on it

1657
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:21,059
for a few years but um

1658
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,339
I have been growing

1659
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:28,140
um

1660
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:30,838
a line from hive his subterfuge it's his

1661
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:32,640
um improved ABC line

1662
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:36,659
it's a you know

1663
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,400
the plants are very ABC they're

1664
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:40,738
you know you can tell he's working quite

1665
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,939
a bit it's pretty inbred the plants are

1666
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:44,519
sluggish

1667
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:46,318
um takes a while to get them going

1668
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,719
um and I've been kind of making scenes

1669
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,460
with it playing with it I've made a good

1670
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,239
amount of hybrids with it

1671
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,880
um

1672
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:55,919
trying to

1673
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,400
get a little more potency out of it and

1674
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:03,359
trying to get away from the serpentaline

1675
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:06,960
which is very I mean it's responsible

1676
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:09,000
and it's not it's not like um

1677
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,340
it's not like train wrecked or kindling

1678
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,619
where it has some interesting notes in

1679
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:16,860
it it's kind of like a flat kind of

1680
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:20,039
one-dimensional flavor

1681
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:23,099
um so the first time I made seats with

1682
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:26,460
that line I crossed it too

1683
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:29,520
um several things that I thought could

1684
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:32,100
Aid in the potency and the flavor uh Kim

1685
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,080
D Bubba Kush

1686
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:36,360
um

1687
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:37,079
I think TK a few others

1688
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:38,819
um

1689
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:41,698
and

1690
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:43,079
I I popped some of those hybrids

1691
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:45,960
um see

1692
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:49,920
TMD ABC is the one that I've kind of

1693
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:52,319
messed with the most so when you uh pop

1694
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,440
the f1s of it they're all normal there's

1695
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,880
not a mutant anything in there

1696
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:59,299
yeah

1697
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:03,420
did you know you get some plants that

1698
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:06,600
have the kind of ABC type

1699
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:09,779
um flavor palette and Pie you know some

1700
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,039
stuff that just isn't really hitting on

1701
01:11:09,779 --> 01:11:13,019
all that much

1702
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,600
um yeah but

1703
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:18,780
um in the f1s they're completely normal

1704
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,460
plants when you ask to them though uh

1705
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:23,819
when you F2 them you'll start to see

1706
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:26,039
that recessive Leaf top out

1707
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:29,759
um you get a mix of them

1708
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:32,279
but to lock down that recessive trait

1709
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,659
you know you have to have to take it to

1710
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:36,539
an F3

1711
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:37,738
um and it's something I've been messing

1712
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:39,960
with it

1713
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:42,658
um I've talked to CSI about it because

1714
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,500
he's done much more work with it than I

1715
01:11:42,658 --> 01:11:45,599
have

1716
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,420
um with the

1717
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,520
uh ABC line not not subject huge but

1718
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:53,760
same kind of thing

1719
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:57,659
um but you know once you get back to

1720
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,320
having that mutation on the leaf

1721
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:00,359
um

1722
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:03,059
you pretty much

1723
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:06,119
you're back where you started that's in

1724
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,679
square one yeah I mean you can get some

1725
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:11,039
stuff that's a little bit prettier or

1726
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:14,640
smells a little bit better or might be a

1727
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:17,760
tad more potent but you're pretty much

1728
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,900
back in the same ball game you know once

1729
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,980
you get to that level

1730
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:20,759
so

1731
01:12:19,979 --> 01:12:22,198
it's

1732
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,119
um

1733
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:25,500
and that's another thing you know it's a

1734
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:28,859
it's a recessive trait that you're

1735
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:31,380
trying to isolate but once you work it

1736
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:33,658
to the point of getting there

1737
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:37,020
um it seems to be linked with that kind

1738
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:40,439
of adult or penalteen low potency thing

1739
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:43,440
so yeah it's um it's taught me

1740
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:45,599
a lot that that's a good line for

1741
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,059
messing with like something like that or

1742
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,760
something like maybe breeding Auto

1743
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,860
flowers where you can visually see the

1744
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,400
recessives that you're looking for

1745
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:59,339
um but it's been um it's taught me a lot

1746
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:02,399
about reading it's just uh it's just not

1747
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:05,640
easy yeah the stubborn stubborn link

1748
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:07,198
traits like that are crazy like yeah I

1749
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,760
mean do you think that's what Hive was

1750
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:11,219
doing because I know when you go back

1751
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,619
and look at the um the genetics and

1752
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:16,140
makeup of subterfuge it's it's like got

1753
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:18,420
so much in it was it I wonder if he was

1754
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,420
just going like always moving forward

1755
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:23,699
like okay I'm gonna try to put Calio in

1756
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:25,579
it and then uh it didn't really work

1757
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:29,219
that great let's try this one

1758
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:32,640
you know or yeah

1759
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:35,640
I don't know how he did it um you know

1760
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:39,480
I've never talked to him about that

1761
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:41,280
um but I assume he probably had to do it

1762
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:44,099
kind of similar to

1763
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:46,679
what I did or what you know CSI has done

1764
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,840
where you have to take it to an F3 just

1765
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:49,859
to get back to that mutation

1766
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,860
um yeah

1767
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:55,859
so you would really

1768
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:58,979
I feel like you would need to just

1769
01:13:55,859 --> 01:14:01,380
inbreed it to the point of it not being

1770
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:04,619
fun to grow to get anything else out of

1771
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:08,460
it yeah we we actually have an Aussie

1772
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:11,279
guy who is in our Discord a new member

1773
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:13,319
um and I believe he worked sort of

1774
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:15,119
collaborated with Caleb or was growing a

1775
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,158
bunch of ABC in Australia talking to

1776
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:19,559
Caleb about it so maybe he'll have

1777
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:20,519
interesting questions to follow up with

1778
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,860
um

1779
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,360
I think uh yeah really cool to hear an

1780
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:25,679
account of

1781
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,719
um

1782
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,819
actively looking for these recessives

1783
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:31,739
actually seeing like the ratios come out

1784
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:33,479
in f2s

1785
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:36,019
um yeah there must have been a pretty

1786
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:38,639
amazing experience

1787
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:42,120
ABC was its own like

1788
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,520
wild rare cannabis hunt for a lot of us

1789
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:47,039
that were like straight up dorks I think

1790
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,840
like not everyone even knew about it

1791
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:51,359
like it was this kind of like Niche

1792
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,980
thing that like in the even in the

1793
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:54,779
breeding Community it was still a niche

1794
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:57,059
for anybody to even note that this thing

1795
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:59,158
[ __ ] existed and nobody could get

1796
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:02,100
their [ __ ] mitts on it in the US and

1797
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:05,339
you know there's the Emory release of

1798
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:08,219
like that and flow crossed and yeah yeah

1799
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:10,980
I had some of those did you

1800
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:13,920
yeah but I when I got them

1801
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:16,979
I didn't want to pop them until I you

1802
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,319
know yeah I I don't know what it was I

1803
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,698
was saving saving them hoping you know I

1804
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,219
could do some reading with it or

1805
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:25,019
something and I didn't know for the

1806
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:27,719
night you you lose your virginity and

1807
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:32,000
then you can pop up yeah exactly exactly

1808
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:32,000
um yeah but that never happens so um

1809
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,460
they just gotta uh yeah I let them age

1810
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:40,759
out and I couldn't pop them when I went

1811
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,760
to them

1812
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:47,159
I can't remember how many packs were

1813
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:49,920
released to that but it was so limited

1814
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:52,920
yeah it was um but that's what that's

1815
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,859
what uh odds line was based off of yeah

1816
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,899
that Emery drop

1817
01:15:55,859 --> 01:16:00,719
that's right

1818
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:03,599
but yeah someone finally I you our

1819
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:07,619
friend rezen lung even went to Australia

1820
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,579
to try to go track down ABC like on his

1821
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:10,920
own

1822
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:14,819
and you couldn't do it and then

1823
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:18,359
eventually eventually one dude like

1824
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:19,920
still kind of I personally my opinion is

1825
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:21,299
it's kind of sketch how we came across

1826
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,480
them I'm still thinking that they might

1827
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:26,520
just be by a hype somehow like

1828
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,559
backdoored maybe

1829
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,560
um but yeah somehow they were brought to

1830
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,440
Market eventually and uh

1831
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:36,780
I'm glad they did though yeah

1832
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:39,899
yeah it's definitely um something more

1833
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:42,500
for like the hardcore nerds than the

1834
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:45,539
people that are like trying to grow

1835
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:49,560
smokable flowers to sell

1836
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:51,479
um because it has zero marketability I

1837
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,780
think but um I mean it just looks like

1838
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:56,879
Ivy it looks like Ivy yeah yeah they're

1839
01:16:54,779 --> 01:16:59,219
they're super cool plants

1840
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,619
yeah I have a bunch of your your version

1841
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:03,420
of the subterfuge going on right now

1842
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:06,119
yeah yeah

1843
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,658
I have bags of it that I still haven't

1844
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:08,658
shopped

1845
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,920
but man okay yeah

1846
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:16,619
I think it's cool I wish everybody grew

1847
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,440
up even for ornamental it's uh oh yeah

1848
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:21,599
yeah I mean we got a place

1849
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:23,639
yeah you could grow a yard full of it

1850
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,020
nobody know what the [ __ ] it is that's

1851
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,880
for sure

1852
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:29,340
yeah

1853
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:33,659
okay well I thought we could maybe wrap

1854
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:35,460
up this bit on recessives and we have so

1855
01:17:33,658 --> 01:17:36,719
many questions for you um but I think

1856
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,640
before we get on to some of the more

1857
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,500
open-ended ones

1858
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,579
um I'd love for you to kind of

1859
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,698
um

1860
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:47,158
I suppose not conclude but um

1861
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:50,158
we can we can focus a bit more on your

1862
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:52,799
work again and maybe you can talk

1863
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,539
through some of the recent releases

1864
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,760
um the Appalachia crosses

1865
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:58,439
that you've made maybe standouts

1866
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,600
anything interesting in in the process

1867
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:04,919
of making those

1868
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:07,920
uh yeah so those were all you know

1869
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:10,079
I didn't cross everything I have in my

1870
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,060
stable to it I mean that's kind of

1871
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:15,600
that's kind of the move but there was

1872
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:18,179
you know it was all plants uh that I

1873
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,760
felt could benefit from certain aspects

1874
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:23,699
of it um you know

1875
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:26,100
old Betsy is one of my

1876
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:27,658
favorite things to smoke the flavor is

1877
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:30,420
incredible

1878
01:18:27,658 --> 01:18:32,579
um it's just it's it's like opening a

1879
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:34,560
jar of Grandma's jelly I mean it just

1880
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:37,500
you can't stop smelling it it's just

1881
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,480
incredible every time I open a jar I'm

1882
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,600
like oh [ __ ] let me just smoke a little

1883
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:44,158
um but it you know when you're vegging

1884
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,460
the plant it always wants to throw

1885
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:49,139
pistols if you get it root down if you

1886
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:52,920
get a root bound it wants to start

1887
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:55,140
flowering if you feed it the wrong thing

1888
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,819
it wants to start flowering it's a it's

1889
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:59,280
kind of a visual plant

1890
01:18:56,819 --> 01:19:01,619
um so I wanted to

1891
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:04,079
cross it to something

1892
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:06,599
so that I could kind of I wanted

1893
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:08,698
something similar that I could kind of

1894
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,679
you know go back and pull that pull that

1895
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:12,899
type of plant out with

1896
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:15,658
um that was

1897
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:17,698
that was a pretty successful one I think

1898
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:20,420
I I really like the way that that came

1899
01:19:17,698 --> 01:19:20,419
out um

1900
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:24,899
yeah can I ask you could you use that

1901
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,840
trigger that that

1902
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:30,859
that pre-flowering trait as a beneficial

1903
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,860
thing for outdoor

1904
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:37,020
um outdoor it doesn't seem to do it the

1905
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:38,639
way that I grow

1906
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:42,659
so

1907
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,380
in full sun it it's a little bit more

1908
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:45,839
um

1909
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:48,719
it's a little bit more vigorous in the

1910
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:52,560
Sun and I normally grow in

1911
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:54,779
pretty large pots so yeah uh it doesn't

1912
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,460
have that issue where like if it hits

1913
01:19:54,779 --> 01:20:00,300
you know if it hits the side of the pot

1914
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:02,760
it gets pissed yeah um okay that makes a

1915
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:05,579
lot more sense yeah yeah

1916
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,100
okay continue sorry

1917
01:20:05,579 --> 01:20:09,840
um but I did that one

1918
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:15,060
um the shoreline is

1919
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:17,340
one of my favorites I smoke it daily

1920
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:21,179
um it's an incredible plant it is an

1921
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:24,119
absolute Beast outside for my climate of

1922
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:29,219
all the cuts that I've grown outside it

1923
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:32,579
uh performs the best uh yield wise it is

1924
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:34,859
very uh rot resistant you can take it

1925
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:36,960
through some [ __ ] in the fall and it's

1926
01:20:34,859 --> 01:20:39,179
um it comes out fine when everything

1927
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,760
else is kind of melting away it's just

1928
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:44,819
standing there rocking

1929
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,880
um so that's that's one I did

1930
01:20:44,819 --> 01:20:46,880
um

1931
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:52,260
maybe you can ask I can ask the First

1932
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,480
Community question

1933
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,820
um we're just from other groups

1934
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,839
um and I imagine from Kristen as well in

1935
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:00,299
spirit

1936
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,340
um they want to know what the shoreline

1937
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,900
what you've observed the shoreline tends

1938
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:07,440
to pass

1939
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:09,599
okay uh so the shoreline

1940
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:13,439
it comes through pretty

1941
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:17,880
pretty strong in crosses for the the

1942
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:20,519
Terps the it has this on any Funk trash

1943
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,319
kind of just nastiness

1944
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,140
um it's super loud

1945
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:27,179
um you know it's when it's flowering you

1946
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:29,760
know you got some Shoreline in there um

1947
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:32,699
it it comes through really well for that

1948
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:35,940
and it it throws these

1949
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:39,359
fat colas you know it's in Veg it's not

1950
01:21:35,939 --> 01:21:43,439
super vigorous but once you flip it it

1951
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:45,380
it just beasts out and um you know of

1952
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:48,960
the

1953
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:51,300
Appalachian crosses that's probably the

1954
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,800
that and the the GMO cross are the best

1955
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:55,560
yielding

1956
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,960
um but it's it's uh it's just a

1957
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,820
phenomenal plant and it passes the

1958
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,420
things that I like

1959
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:02,460
um

1960
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:05,460
but you know the Apple actually gives it

1961
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:06,600
a little bit a little bit more Vigor in

1962
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:10,500
veg

1963
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:13,800
um it it's easier to get up going

1964
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,579
but yeah the funk the Short Line Funk is

1965
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,140
what

1966
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:18,119
what I

1967
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:21,020
what I want it to pass and luckily what

1968
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:21,019
it does yes

1969
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:27,260
we'll be happy

1970
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:27,259
yeah I'm interested

1971
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:33,659
uh that's a a cool one so you know GMO

1972
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:36,119
is

1973
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:37,500
is pretty well known for dominating

1974
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:40,198
crosses

1975
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,340
um it dominates a lot of things

1976
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:44,460
um

1977
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:47,880
with Appalachia it

1978
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:50,279
it still comes through really strong

1979
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:53,340
um you know if you want

1980
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:55,198
a close representation of GMO

1981
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,760
you should pop them because you'll get

1982
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,939
you'll get some that are kind of dead

1983
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:02,119
ringers for it you also get some yeah

1984
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:06,178
you also get some that have that same

1985
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:09,658
kind of resin production and that same

1986
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:11,100
um that same kind of dumping ability of

1987
01:23:09,658 --> 01:23:14,879
GMOs that have a little bit more

1988
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:16,679
tropical flavor to them they still still

1989
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,779
have a ton of stretch

1990
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:21,899
um but they have a lot of fuel on the

1991
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:23,519
back end so that that's a good cross and

1992
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:24,899
if you're looking for something that's a

1993
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,560
little more

1994
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,559
um

1995
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:31,380
you know modern kind of weed like I

1996
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,420
don't like most modern things I try I

1997
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:36,539
don't like gelatos at all

1998
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:38,940
I I'm not a big fan of any cookies any

1999
01:23:36,539 --> 01:23:41,158
kind of cakes I've tried a ton of that

2000
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:43,439
stuff and you know

2001
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:46,920
I like to grow weeds it gives me high

2002
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:47,698
and that stuff just doesn't do it for me

2003
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,679
um

2004
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:52,559
GMO is

2005
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:55,560
I think probably the most remarkable

2006
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,260
plant that's come out of that of the

2007
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,460
most you know recent eras of things and

2008
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:02,280
um

2009
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:03,420
it's a it's an incredible plant and I

2010
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:05,939
just wanted

2011
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:08,880
um you know I wanted something that

2012
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:10,919
people could could find GMO but maybe

2013
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:14,699
have a little more variability than a

2014
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:17,520
lot of the you know GMA work out there

2015
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:19,738
yeah very killer

2016
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:24,320
um definitely the one that interests me

2017
01:24:19,738 --> 01:24:28,139
and uh is the Electric Boogaloo cross

2018
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:29,759
yep yeah so that that one's a bit of a

2019
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:32,340
beast

2020
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,679
um you know locals has a really good

2021
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,400
kind of mix of Phoenix going right now I

2022
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:38,219
have

2023
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,899
one outdoor that is

2024
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:42,658
um massive

2025
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:45,179
um it's hasn't started to flower yet and

2026
01:24:42,658 --> 01:24:47,039
uh it's yeah like I don't know eight

2027
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:51,060
feet tall it's giant

2028
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:52,500
um but there there is um you know I

2029
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:55,560
tried reversing

2030
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:58,500
Electric Boogaloo several times and it

2031
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:02,280
just didn't it didn't produce pollen

2032
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:04,439
um but I was I it has some really

2033
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:06,658
interesting stuff in there there are

2034
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:09,359
some plants in there that look

2035
01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:13,379
like Neville tease there are some plants

2036
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:15,839
in there that yeah there's some you know

2037
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:18,119
sensitive Expressions that have a ton of

2038
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:21,600
the kind of candied mango that I

2039
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:26,340
associate with green crack you know um

2040
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:29,699
Electric Boogaloo has has mango but

2041
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:31,800
more so like mid flowering like you know

2042
01:25:29,698 --> 01:25:33,839
if you take it if you take it to the end

2043
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:37,020
that kind of dissipates and you have a

2044
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,659
you know a spicy just I mean it's an

2045
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:41,580
amazing finished flower but

2046
01:25:39,658 --> 01:25:43,738
um I wanted to see if you know that

2047
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:45,359
cross could maybe bring out a little

2048
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:47,279
more of that into the finished flower

2049
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:49,859
and it does

2050
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:52,198
um make sense yeah so there's there's a

2051
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:55,019
there's a pretty wide um

2052
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:58,079
you know there's a there's a wide mix in

2053
01:25:55,020 --> 01:26:00,719
that one but a lot of a lot of fatigue

2054
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:05,100
Expressions you get a few with nice

2055
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:07,079
running colas and um you know I'm a

2056
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:09,900
huge fan of

2057
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:12,119
sativas I mean that's I love them that

2058
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:14,759
and dog [ __ ] A lot of people glue that's

2059
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:16,079
one I smoke every single day until I run

2060
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,739
out like I just did

2061
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,579
um

2062
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:22,500
but yeah that's that's a great one I

2063
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:24,779
wonder if it's like uh like a lot of us

2064
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:28,260
that grew up on Mexican stuff just have

2065
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:30,658
this long lasting love for for highs

2066
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:32,400
like that I don't know I like I I have a

2067
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:36,119
love for for all those type of plants

2068
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:39,960
myself very much yeah it's um well it's

2069
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:44,880
but it's I think a little bit more

2070
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:45,480
palatable to a broader audience because

2071
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,179
um

2072
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:50,698
like you know hazes or Mexicans or

2073
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:51,739
Colombians they can they can get you

2074
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:55,379
like

2075
01:26:51,738 --> 01:26:57,839
paranoid and disoriented you can get uh

2076
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:59,279
you know just so ripped that you're you

2077
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,020
know confused disoriented it's almost

2078
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:06,420
like you know tripping

2079
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:09,300
um yeah but but uh dog [ __ ] is just it's

2080
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:11,639
a it's a up high but it's it's gentle

2081
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:15,119
it's a great flavor and you're just

2082
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:17,940
soaring it's just you know it's like a

2083
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,380
memory of the first you know one of the

2084
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:20,759
first times you got really high and

2085
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:22,139
you're like riding your bike around it's

2086
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,320
just a beautiful

2087
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:27,539
childhood Bliss kind of high I love it

2088
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:30,179
yeah that's one of the ones that I I

2089
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:32,100
realized at are get together that we had

2090
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:33,840
last time there wasn't anybody in the

2091
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:36,960
room that didn't like absolutely love

2092
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,880
that like you know greens are disagreed

2093
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,079
on different things except for dog [ __ ]

2094
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,460
for some reason was the one that

2095
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:44,939
everybody

2096
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:47,219
yeah yeah I mean from the first time I

2097
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:48,479
smoked it I've I've just loved that one

2098
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:50,520
that's one of my

2099
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:54,059
all-time favorites

2100
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:55,920
by the way your candy was fire fire fire

2101
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,900
still one of my favorite girls of

2102
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,859
candies ever

2103
01:27:57,899 --> 01:28:04,198
uh sometimes I get it right yeah I bet

2104
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:06,779
yeah yeah

2105
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:09,599
was there anything else you wanted to

2106
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:11,039
add uh about this your recent release

2107
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,539
because otherwise it was going to move

2108
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,060
us on to

2109
01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:16,859
you maybe give us a sneak preview of

2110
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:19,020
what you're doing now or what's coming

2111
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:20,579
yeah the only other one I'll mention

2112
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:23,280
just because I have a lot of people ask

2113
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:27,119
about it a lot a lot of people ask me

2114
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:31,259
what the most fully line that I have is

2115
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:33,059
and um you know the the Gorilla Glue

2116
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:35,219
cross

2117
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:36,840
um I just harvested a couple of those

2118
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:37,920
and that is

2119
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:42,719
just

2120
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:44,940
that rank fuel it has some sweetness

2121
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:48,859
come through but it's more of like a

2122
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:51,059
like GT4 to me has like a artificial

2123
01:28:48,859 --> 01:28:55,380
chocolatyness to it

2124
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:59,219
um and this has like fuel with like a

2125
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:01,340
a like powdered cocoa milk chocolatey

2126
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:03,359
thing on the back end it's just

2127
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:07,139
intoxicating to me

2128
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:08,819
um it's really really nice and um you

2129
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:12,060
know that's one

2130
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:14,099
where I haven't done a lot of reading

2131
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:15,960
with gg4 and I wasn't

2132
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:17,820
you know I wasn't sure on it but man

2133
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,439
that was one that really surprised me

2134
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:22,619
when I grew him out

2135
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:24,059
um it's there's some phenomenal plants

2136
01:29:22,619 --> 01:29:26,279
in there

2137
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:28,280
I think a lot of us that like have tried

2138
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:31,079
to avoid using a lot of hike clones

2139
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:33,300
waited a long time to use gg4 because it

2140
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:34,859
was so heavily pushed like maybe even

2141
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,840
prior to the cookies there was just so

2142
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:39,899
stuffed in your face like you need to be

2143
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,400
growing gg4 so I didn't yeah I'm

2144
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:42,658
interested in it it looked like a

2145
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:44,279
polyhybrid to me and I figured okay

2146
01:29:42,658 --> 01:29:45,658
that's going to breed so variant that

2147
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:48,840
why would I

2148
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:54,379
even care yeah but it breeds

2149
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:54,380
yeah it's remarkably consistent it is

2150
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:59,819
yeah for being like a poly hybrid bag

2151
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:02,100
seat I mean it is it is

2152
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:04,799
I grew you know half of the plants could

2153
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:08,639
have been cuts of the same plant that I

2154
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,779
grew it was yeah it has I think the

2155
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,719
least

2156
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:15,238
least Variety in any of my lines now

2157
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,639
yeah I I was one of the last to grow

2158
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:19,019
that cut like because I it was like I

2159
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:20,279
said I just didn't want anything to do

2160
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,900
with it just because of how many other

2161
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:23,698
people were using it and I I just

2162
01:30:21,899 --> 01:30:25,259
thought I'd do something different

2163
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:27,238
but when I finally did it I was like oh

2164
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,219
damn this is actually pretty good I like

2165
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:31,678
how this braids too it's actually good

2166
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:33,840
to smoke on its own too and I know CSI

2167
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:36,000
had that same sentiment like he hit me

2168
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,860
up he's like damn this is good why

2169
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,319
didn't anybody tell us

2170
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:42,719
yeah it's it's a good one

2171
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:45,779
um yeah it does really well outside here

2172
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:48,000
too so it kind of sticks around for that

2173
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:49,139
um and that's kind of why I kept it

2174
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,020
around

2175
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:54,600
um but I've been uh I've been pretty

2176
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:56,340
surprised with the way it reads

2177
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,199
me I'm glad you guys mentioned it

2178
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:00,659
because yeah I was going to point out

2179
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:03,119
that I didn't see many of you working

2180
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:05,960
with it until relatively recently I

2181
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:05,960
thought that was interesting

2182
01:31:07,698 --> 01:31:12,238
he said I had to try it I'm like really

2183
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:14,039
I don't know I mean I like Josie a lot

2184
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:16,259
he's a cool dude and we got along and

2185
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:17,399
and uh and then I started smoking

2186
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,960
everybody's grocery I was like God damn

2187
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:20,759
it's actually kind of good but will it

2188
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,219
breathe like this more importantly than

2189
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,860
anything like it not only is it a good

2190
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:27,779
grower it breeds very well true to tight

2191
01:31:25,859 --> 01:31:29,819
kind of you know yep

2192
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:32,519
yeah oh yeah

2193
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:35,880
okay so I'm I gotta plug the fact that

2194
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:38,280
uh these these seats these packs are

2195
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:41,460
available on riotsseeds.com yes

2196
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:44,399
available go there check it out and

2197
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:46,920
um yeah so I thought maybe now to to to

2198
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:49,138
more or less wrap up a bit on your work

2199
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,940
in this like linear fashion

2200
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:53,219
um would you be able to give us an idea

2201
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:55,439
of like what you're looking towards now

2202
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:57,420
and in and for the future

2203
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:58,919
um we had a question from moonbeard

2204
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,600
about

2205
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:03,480
um Haze experiments I think that he's

2206
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:06,659
heard of that you're you might be doing

2207
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:07,979
um uh yeah yeah so I have that going

2208
01:32:06,658 --> 01:32:11,219
um

2209
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:12,599
I actually have a few things before that

2210
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:15,899
like I have

2211
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:17,520
seeds done for a few other projects one

2212
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:19,559
of them is um

2213
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,820
I

2214
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:26,039
I was selecting a

2215
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:29,219
Appalachia out of the S3

2216
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:31,560
um looking for a candidate to do a green

2217
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:32,840
crack that cross with

2218
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:37,139
um

2219
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:41,760
I had some hiccups with you know the

2220
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:46,800
sourcing of the cut so I had to get it

2221
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:50,280
I um I had to get it from another source

2222
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,840
uh for po political reasons

2223
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:53,698
um so I

2224
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,779
have that

2225
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:58,138
um

2226
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:59,880
have that cross the seats finishing up

2227
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:03,659
now for the back cross

2228
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:06,600
um and I have already harvested

2229
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:08,219
um I wanted to remake that Appalachian

2230
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,199
diesel that

2231
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:15,960
um I did a few years ago

2232
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:18,539
so I seeded a pretty large shower diesel

2233
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:20,119
plant and I seeded

2234
01:33:18,539 --> 01:33:24,000
um

2235
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:27,779
the headband cut that you know goes by

2236
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:31,380
L.A Kush from that's a dog

2237
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:33,960
um that's that's another

2238
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,679
very nice diesel

2239
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:37,319
um

2240
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:40,859
I really love that plant

2241
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:43,439
um indoor outdoor it has

2242
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:45,299
extreme potency it's a great plant um so

2243
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:49,799
I seeded that

2244
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:50,520
um a few other things I crossed it to my

2245
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,239
favorite

2246
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,380
um

2247
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:59,459
Santa Cruz Rec plant from Top

2248
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:01,739
um pack uh Santa Cruz good form

2249
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:04,560
um I had a

2250
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:07,619
plant that was just a beast in there it

2251
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,820
um was very kind of train wreck dominant

2252
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:10,439
plant

2253
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:15,779
um but in the last few weeks of flower

2254
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:19,019
it had this really nice spicy blue

2255
01:34:15,779 --> 01:34:21,599
Essence kind of come through just a

2256
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:24,659
really really nice hybrid of uh the

2257
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,880
Santa Cruz blue dream and train wreck

2258
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:29,399
um so I seeded that plant with those I'm

2259
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,239
actually just popped some of this to try

2260
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:32,579
out

2261
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:35,819
um and then I have the

2262
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:37,319
Green Crack fully pollinated

2263
01:34:35,819 --> 01:34:39,479
um and those you know those would be

2264
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:41,639
ready to test here shortly

2265
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:43,439
that's awesome

2266
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:47,579
yeah and then

2267
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:49,259
um then I had another uh smaller run of

2268
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:50,119
some

2269
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:54,119
um

2270
01:34:50,119 --> 01:34:55,019
Kim D Appalachian stuff I was messing

2271
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:57,840
with

2272
01:34:55,020 --> 01:35:00,920
um f2ing it fat Crossing into Dickens

2273
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:04,739
the um just doing a few things there

2274
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:06,420
uh kind of building block work nothing

2275
01:35:04,738 --> 01:35:08,099
um that's that's probably just going to

2276
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:09,899
be stuff I mess with

2277
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:14,639
um but right now

2278
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:16,859
I'm I am doing like a haze hybrid hunt I

2279
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:20,579
uh I popped

2280
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:22,979
super super Haze I have pops Northern

2281
01:35:20,579 --> 01:35:27,420
Lights five Haze

2282
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:30,539
um mango Haze the team vo

2283
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:34,139
um Wally duck it's mango Haze IBL line

2284
01:35:30,539 --> 01:35:35,340
that he's he's been bred in Australia

2285
01:35:34,139 --> 01:35:38,460
um it's

2286
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:41,579
um yeah and then a Neville's Haze mango

2287
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:44,760
Haze uh also from Wally duck

2288
01:35:41,579 --> 01:35:48,059
um and of all those lines

2289
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:49,800
um I've grown them out and I have my

2290
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:53,639
favorites

2291
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:57,239
um the mango Haze I think is the the one

2292
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:57,900
um yeah the Clint the plants are

2293
01:35:57,238 --> 01:35:59,819
um

2294
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:03,059
a little bit

2295
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:05,939
a little bit more finicky it's um you

2296
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:08,159
know it's not as easy a plant to grow as

2297
01:36:05,939 --> 01:36:10,619
super silver haze

2298
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:11,879
um but it super silver haze tends to be

2299
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:15,119
pretty

2300
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,319
pretty much a sort of tunneline Dom

2301
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:18,779
plant

2302
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:20,340
um has a ton of that with the mango Haze

2303
01:36:18,779 --> 01:36:21,779
you get it you get some sweeter

2304
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,520
spiciness

2305
01:36:21,779 --> 01:36:25,380
um high is

2306
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,760
consistently

2307
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:28,619
better

2308
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:32,039
um I think it's a better representation

2309
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:33,059
of what people want in a sativa type

2310
01:36:32,039 --> 01:36:34,560
High

2311
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:36,300
um

2312
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,000
not as muddled you know super silver

2313
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:41,039
haze you can feel the Indica influence

2314
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,340
um it's more of a hybrid

2315
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:47,698
but but the mango Haze

2316
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:50,819
um that's my favorite I found

2317
01:36:47,698 --> 01:36:51,539
a male that I really like in there

2318
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:53,698
um

2319
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:56,399
I'm going to be

2320
01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:59,399
uh you know making some more of those

2321
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:01,079
seeds as my personal thing you know

2322
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:02,399
that's something while he's working with

2323
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:07,500
so

2324
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:09,719
um but I'm I'm crossing that to a lot of

2325
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,039
cuts that I have plants that I have that

2326
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:11,760
I really like

2327
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:14,340
um

2328
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:18,300
so that will let me start calling you

2329
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:19,800
Virginia mango bro I know I know I was

2330
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,380
just thinking about it I was like dude I

2331
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,639
need to get the [ __ ] away from mango

2332
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:25,500
it's like you know blue I just kept

2333
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:27,539
going to it and it's just you know yeah

2334
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,738
you find it something you love and that

2335
01:37:27,539 --> 01:37:31,979
just is it

2336
01:37:28,738 --> 01:37:35,099
well and mango Haze is is way different

2337
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:38,879
than like a candied mango crackers yeah

2338
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:41,100
sure it's um you know I don't know if I

2339
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,659
was naming it if I call it mango Haze

2340
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:45,060
but you know that was the name of the

2341
01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:47,939
mother was mango so

2342
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:50,639
um but yeah I'll be I'll I'll be doing a

2343
01:37:47,939 --> 01:37:52,979
bunch of uh a bunch of hybrids with that

2344
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:54,779
um hitting it to

2345
01:37:52,979 --> 01:37:57,178
um a bunch of the sativa cuts that I

2346
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:59,219
have some of the

2347
01:37:57,179 --> 01:38:01,679
heavier hitters you know the chem dogs

2348
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:04,260
and all that but um yeah there's a few

2349
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:07,800
that I'm I'm really interested to check

2350
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:10,139
out I'm gonna hit the the A5 Haze with

2351
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:11,400
it yeah

2352
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:13,800
so

2353
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:15,839
yeah we'll see we'll see how that goes

2354
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,460
I'm hoping everybody's not too scared to

2355
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,199
release those seed mines because uh

2356
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:21,779
let's say I checked no one else gives a

2357
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:24,658
[ __ ] you know like

2358
01:38:21,779 --> 01:38:25,619
I I yeah friends sit on them and I'm

2359
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:27,839
like what the [ __ ] are you doing

2360
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:31,738
everybody else is releasing them like

2361
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:35,219
you don't have to check yeah it's um

2362
01:38:31,738 --> 01:38:37,259
yeah it's um you know they're political

2363
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:39,899
issues there I

2364
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:43,139
I don't I was wasn't told anything about

2365
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:46,319
it when I got it um it's you know

2366
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:50,340
there are reasons not to release it A5

2367
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:52,619
is is one of them most difficult plants

2368
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:55,800
that I have it's um

2369
01:38:52,619 --> 01:38:57,719
it's not easy to grow it's yeah it's you

2370
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,460
know it's just not and most people that

2371
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:02,100
are used to growing

2372
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:04,380
you know OG kush's salary as well as you

2373
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:07,139
know that modern kind of it's just a

2374
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:09,779
whole whole [ __ ] different ball game

2375
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:10,800
and um yeah it's it's a fussy little

2376
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:13,439
plant

2377
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,020
so you know

2378
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:19,019
and you know I think a lot of those

2379
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:22,199
hybrids that's going to be more kind of

2380
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:25,199
it's not a beginner Grower's plant

2381
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:26,638
um so yeah we'll see how it goes I'm

2382
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:28,979
looking forward to testing them out and

2383
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:31,859
that's something that

2384
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:34,379
um you know it I'm passionate about that

2385
01:39:31,859 --> 01:39:37,019
that type of smoke so it's uh I'm

2386
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:37,980
looking forward to actually getting to

2387
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:40,500
test them

2388
01:39:37,979 --> 01:39:42,419
yeah we need more of that in our

2389
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:45,719
community as is like more of those type

2390
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:47,819
of highs those offerings it's gonna get

2391
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:49,739
it's going to get more and more sparse

2392
01:39:47,819 --> 01:39:51,899
as time goes on because financially it's

2393
01:39:49,738 --> 01:39:53,879
harder to produce things like that so

2394
01:39:51,899 --> 01:39:56,279
hopefully people um

2395
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:59,000
take advantage of it while it's here you

2396
01:39:56,279 --> 01:39:59,000
know while it's around

2397
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:05,939
yeah you know the the commercial

2398
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:09,119
viability of something when breeding is

2399
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:12,599
never kind of been what I go for

2400
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:13,800
um I'm not great at that side of it I'm

2401
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:17,460
basically

2402
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:20,820
make things that I want to see I like to

2403
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:23,340
I like to grow the best flower that I

2404
01:40:20,819 --> 01:40:25,198
can that's what I want to have locked

2405
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,279
down in seed form

2406
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:30,419
um so

2407
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:32,460
I'm not concerned about you know how how

2408
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:35,420
well it does it's just something that I

2409
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,420
feel compelled to do

2410
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:43,019
I want to say that um at this point of

2411
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:44,939
the conversation I'm so stoked like the

2412
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,880
archivist in me is so pleased to have

2413
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:50,039
gotten all of that information from you

2414
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,719
oh yeah yeah really grateful for that

2415
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:53,340
and

2416
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:55,800
um at this point you know was there

2417
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:58,860
anything more you want to say about

2418
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,480
um your work your career so far

2419
01:40:58,859 --> 01:41:01,738
um because otherwise we can also launch

2420
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,379
into

2421
01:41:01,738 --> 01:41:06,658
the Heap of questions that we've gotten

2422
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:09,600
from both Matt and the community

2423
01:41:06,658 --> 01:41:11,399
uh no I think I'm good

2424
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,960
Matt did you want to kick us off on some

2425
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:14,339
of these more like open-ended questions

2426
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,800
I know we even have some like

2427
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:18,179
hypothetical breeding projects yeah I

2428
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,159
don't know if I'll cover some of the

2429
01:41:18,179 --> 01:41:22,679
hypotheticals because we're so far in

2430
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:25,859
and I know we have a ton of questions so

2431
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:27,899
let's um you know one of the questions I

2432
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:29,759
had for you and it's kind of a hard one

2433
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:32,759
because I I thought of something that

2434
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:35,639
would be hard for me to answer what's

2435
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:38,539
something you about the modern seed era

2436
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:38,539
that you enjoy

2437
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:41,698
[Music]

2438
01:41:40,198 --> 01:41:44,579
um

2439
01:41:41,698 --> 01:41:47,279
I like how

2440
01:41:44,579 --> 01:41:48,479
I I like how accessible it is for people

2441
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:49,099
I've always

2442
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:52,618
um

2443
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:55,079
I've always been a tinkerer in in the

2444
01:41:52,618 --> 01:41:57,479
weed world you know it's um it's always

2445
01:41:55,079 --> 01:41:59,698
been a passion thing for me more than

2446
01:41:57,479 --> 01:42:02,399
monetary

2447
01:41:59,698 --> 01:42:04,738
um it's I like how accessible it is how

2448
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:07,379
how so many different people are doing

2449
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:10,019
different things uh

2450
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:11,579
it's not you know a lot of the releases

2451
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:14,159
you see and I'm not gonna name it

2452
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:16,019
because I don't wanna crash anybody on

2453
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:17,638
it but it's just the same [ __ ] crosses

2454
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:21,420
the same [ __ ]

2455
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:22,560
um which drives me crazy and you know

2456
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:24,960
I'm

2457
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:27,780
I can say that I'm guilty of it you know

2458
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,000
I've made a GMO cross I've

2459
01:42:27,779 --> 01:42:32,039
um you know I've crossed salaries all

2460
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,439
the stuff but you know a lot of the kind

2461
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:38,519
of incestuous lines across together the

2462
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:40,500
cookies cookies and the yeah you know

2463
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:43,560
um that's that's disheartening but I

2464
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:46,198
like I like seeing the unique things

2465
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:48,539
that people are doing and

2466
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:51,479
um I like seeing people do it

2467
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:54,719
on a level that

2468
01:42:51,479 --> 01:42:58,559
you know is satisfying to them

2469
01:42:54,719 --> 01:43:02,340
and less driven for you know having a

2470
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,199
drop that sells out in 30 minutes yeah

2471
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:06,380
um that's a good answer so

2472
01:43:04,198 --> 01:43:09,419
yeah you know like

2473
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:11,340
CSI you know I I've had a ton of respect

2474
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:14,699
for him for a long time and

2475
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:15,960
he does his passion projects and you

2476
01:43:14,698 --> 01:43:18,599
know they don't

2477
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,340
pay the bills I'm sure but that's the

2478
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,900
kind of [ __ ] when I sneak a order into

2479
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:25,679
him that's what I

2480
01:43:21,899 --> 01:43:28,019
I um right you know I want to see I want

2481
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:30,480
to see what the you know

2482
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:33,000
TK cross the

2483
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:34,079
pck is or you know whatever whatever it

2484
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,840
is

2485
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:40,380
um I wanna you know I like I like

2486
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:43,260
exploring different profiles I don't

2487
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:44,880
want you know something that dumps that

2488
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:46,560
I can

2489
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:50,819
sell a bunch of horizon off of or

2490
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:54,539
something you know I like the

2491
01:43:50,819 --> 01:43:56,399
I just like the overall abundance that's

2492
01:43:54,539 --> 01:43:59,219
out there you know it's very different

2493
01:43:56,399 --> 01:44:03,299
than the Dutch the Dutch era

2494
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:05,460
in that early hype kind of era

2495
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:07,560
um so yeah to me you're talking a bit

2496
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:09,239
more about now your breeding philosophy

2497
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:12,119
or kind of your philosophy towards

2498
01:44:09,238 --> 01:44:14,099
cannabis in general like do you do you

2499
01:44:12,118 --> 01:44:15,960
think it's it's evolved or changed much

2500
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:19,579
since those like

2501
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,579
uh brick weed seeds

2502
01:44:19,979 --> 01:44:26,638
um not really for me I'm kind of

2503
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:28,500
you know my number one goal is still to

2504
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,420
have the best

2505
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,679
that I can have

2506
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:34,260
um you know

2507
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:35,940
we early on I learned that I could

2508
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,980
produce something better than I could

2509
01:44:35,939 --> 01:44:40,678
get and

2510
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:43,019
um you know there's there's not a lot of

2511
01:44:40,679 --> 01:44:46,579
things in life that I can have the best

2512
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:46,580
of but I can have the best sweet

2513
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:52,260
that's still

2514
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:54,658
it's still like my number one goal and

2515
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:56,159
what I kind of what I'm constantly going

2516
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:58,019
for

2517
01:44:56,158 --> 01:45:00,539
yeah

2518
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:02,280
yeah love that

2519
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:05,279
all right do you want to bring in some

2520
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:07,139
of the uh the user questions

2521
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:09,300
all right all right I got I got a good

2522
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:11,579
one to start us off because it's I think

2523
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:14,579
it'd be fun in the win wants to know

2524
01:45:11,579 --> 01:45:16,519
what was your worst year with the worst

2525
01:45:14,579 --> 01:45:18,719
outdoor season

2526
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:21,420
oh man

2527
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,760
so I've uh

2528
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:27,300
I I had 20

2529
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:31,440
years of Gorilla growing so I've had

2530
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:34,199
some pretty [ __ ] bad ones I bet um

2531
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:36,178
I'm trying to think

2532
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:40,738
so I've had yeah I've had some [ __ ]

2533
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:43,980
wiped out but the worst I had I had

2534
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:45,599
um a pretty decent outdoor for the area

2535
01:45:43,979 --> 01:45:47,759
that I'm in

2536
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,139
um you know enough that you know

2537
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,119
there's some [ __ ] you thought about

2538
01:45:49,139 --> 01:45:56,100
before you fell asleep at night

2539
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:59,039
and um it was most mostly all in three

2540
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:00,260
sections kind of separated out

2541
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:04,198
um

2542
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:06,480
and in October the whole [ __ ] thing

2543
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:09,658
got ripped

2544
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:12,059
um I I had lost plants I've lost plants

2545
01:46:09,658 --> 01:46:14,399
many times mid-season

2546
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:18,000
um but this one somebody got it somebody

2547
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:20,158
came and they got everything

2548
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,238
um completely ripped me off I had a lot

2549
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:25,079
riding on it I was pretty invested in

2550
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:28,259
that one

2551
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:31,079
um but they left I had a Neville's Haze

2552
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:33,840
plant out there that was [ __ ] massive

2553
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:37,079
taller than everything else

2554
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,880
and I guess they didn't see it

2555
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:41,460
um because it was you know it was mostly

2556
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,159
kind of hybrid style plants smaller

2557
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:46,439
bushier plants I had this one [ __ ]

2558
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:50,158
tree of a plant so

2559
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:52,799
I got ripped off I was [ __ ] defeated

2560
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:54,359
feeling like [ __ ] and I saw that they

2561
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,460
left that plant and it kind of sketched

2562
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:59,460
me out for a little bit

2563
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:01,380
um I bet you know I didn't want it I

2564
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:04,198
didn't want to cut it down

2565
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:06,659
um yeah you know I figured that was that

2566
01:47:04,198 --> 01:47:09,599
was left for me to get [ __ ] whatever

2567
01:47:06,658 --> 01:47:12,859
popped with her yeah so I I just let

2568
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:17,940
that thing go and we had a pretty

2569
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:19,799
pretty mild fall that year so

2570
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:21,779
you know I think it was a couple days

2571
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:24,119
after Thanksgiving I went back and it

2572
01:47:21,779 --> 01:47:29,519
was still there and it was just about

2573
01:47:24,118 --> 01:47:33,479
just about done and um I said I said

2574
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:35,580
[ __ ] it I'm gonna get it so I you know

2575
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:37,919
cut that plant down

2576
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:39,960
staff that appropriately drove it to

2577
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:42,899
where I was trying it

2578
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:45,359
um so I pretty much

2579
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:48,359
lost my whole Harvest except the only

2580
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:50,039
thing I had to smoke until you know the

2581
01:47:48,359 --> 01:47:52,198
next indoor run I did which was probably

2582
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:55,800
going to be into spring was you know

2583
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:58,198
just all this Neville's Haze yeah and it

2584
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:02,279
was a phenomenal plant

2585
01:47:58,198 --> 01:48:03,359
but it was so goddamn strong it was like

2586
01:48:02,279 --> 01:48:07,019
you know

2587
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:10,859
you can smoke that sometimes but you

2588
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:12,840
can't just like you know I was like four

2589
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:16,319
months into just smoking Devil's Haze

2590
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,940
all day like oh my God you smoke it you

2591
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:19,979
go to the grocery store you like start

2592
01:48:17,939 --> 01:48:22,738
to walk in and you're like nah okay this

2593
01:48:19,979 --> 01:48:25,799
[ __ ] right now you know like yeah well

2594
01:48:22,738 --> 01:48:27,959
it's just like but it was you know it

2595
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,639
was an electric winter

2596
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,060
um but that bad

2597
01:48:29,639 --> 01:48:36,000
yeah but I've had that I've had floods

2598
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:38,580
wiped out Gardens I've had

2599
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,100
you know outdoor growing is difficult

2600
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:44,760
enough outdoor Gorilla growing I mean

2601
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:48,800
you have to go into it hoping you get

2602
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:48,800
half of the work you put in out of it

2603
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:56,760
and like that would be so heavy to lose

2604
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:58,859
like a whole crop at like knowing each

2605
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,239
year in a row you can get ripped that

2606
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:04,019
would kill me

2607
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:06,779
yeah yeah it's um it sucks I'm glad I

2608
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:09,360
don't have to do that anymore

2609
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:11,759
yeah for sure

2610
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:14,519
I mean indoor growing you you know that

2611
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,800
that's a possibility but like Gorilla

2612
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:18,440
growing it just seems like almost like a

2613
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,639
weird inevitability

2614
01:49:18,439 --> 01:49:23,039
yeah you know

2615
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,719
yeah it's you know there's so many

2616
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:28,198
different things that can happen you

2617
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:31,079
know people hunting people you know just

2618
01:49:28,198 --> 01:49:34,500
everything yeah serial killers bearing

2619
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:36,679
bodies the normal [ __ ] exactly yeah all

2620
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,679
that

2621
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:43,260
okay

2622
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:44,759
um PBJ asks which of his lines would he

2623
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:49,800
suggest growing for each level of

2624
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,800
experience novice intermediate advanced

2625
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:53,219
okay

2626
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:57,779
um so

2627
01:49:53,219 --> 01:50:00,179
the appalache stuff overall they're it's

2628
01:49:57,779 --> 01:50:02,579
it makes for some very

2629
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:03,300
easy plants I think

2630
01:50:02,579 --> 01:50:05,819
um

2631
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:09,179
there there are some that are a little

2632
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:12,359
bit more finicky I think you know the

2633
01:50:09,179 --> 01:50:14,060
dog [ __ ] Appalachia is a little a little

2634
01:50:12,359 --> 01:50:17,819
more intermediate but for the most part

2635
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:21,300
those are pretty easy plants

2636
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:24,539
um as a beginner I would say that this

2637
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,520
the F3 Appalachia or the

2638
01:50:24,539 --> 01:50:29,460
um

2639
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:32,100
which is the old Betsy Appalachia those

2640
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,600
are I mean kind of set it and forget it

2641
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:36,060
plants

2642
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:38,460
um the intermediate ones would be stuff

2643
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:40,260
like you know the lupus headband

2644
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,579
Appalachia

2645
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:43,619
um

2646
01:50:41,579 --> 01:50:46,198
you know

2647
01:50:43,618 --> 01:50:49,198
nah the GMO is pretty easy too

2648
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:50,819
um but you know when we if I end up

2649
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:53,879
releasing any of the hay stuff that's

2650
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:56,639
gonna be more on the advanced level of

2651
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:59,880
growing just because mango Haze itself

2652
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:02,699
is a finicky plant and a lot of the cuts

2653
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:03,420
that I really liked that I'm using

2654
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:07,799
um

2655
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:10,319
as mothers a lot of those are you know

2656
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:13,219
more finicky plants you have they go

2657
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:15,658
longer you have a lot stretch

2658
01:51:13,219 --> 01:51:19,219
it's a lot more

2659
01:51:15,658 --> 01:51:19,219
you have to think about it a lot more

2660
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:22,980
nice

2661
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,380
thank you for that

2662
01:51:22,979 --> 01:51:27,238
um we've got a big one from Blazer panda

2663
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:29,340
a good mate

2664
01:51:27,238 --> 01:51:32,759
does hi Lonesome like to go by

2665
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:34,380
Appalachia daddy or father Abby that's a

2666
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:37,260
good question

2667
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:38,359
well local calls me Daddy so that's the

2668
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:41,699
thing that

2669
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:43,319
is true because local also asked what's

2670
01:51:41,698 --> 01:51:45,658
it like being my dad

2671
01:51:43,319 --> 01:51:47,939
[Laughter]

2672
01:51:45,658 --> 01:51:50,420
uh well you know that's another instance

2673
01:51:47,939 --> 01:51:54,419
of trying to set it and forget it yeah

2674
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:54,420
right okay

2675
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:57,600
yep

2676
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,600
more Earnest one

2677
01:52:02,939 --> 01:52:05,759
um

2678
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:08,159
in the wind wants to know a bit more

2679
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,960
about your grow take

2680
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:12,359
um

2681
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:14,520
he says like besides the soil mix what's

2682
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:16,859
your what are your veg weeks outdoor

2683
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,860
dates

2684
01:52:16,859 --> 01:52:23,039
I guess he wants to know yeah

2685
01:52:19,859 --> 01:52:27,059
um it it varies greatly

2686
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:27,960
um I kind of I I do a lot of different

2687
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:30,719
things

2688
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:32,100
um in the last few years I've gotten

2689
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:36,480
into

2690
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:40,020
um doing some light depths outside so

2691
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:44,519
um where I used to put plants out

2692
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:48,000
around you know the first of June now

2693
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:50,880
I'm I'm stepping in the spring and my

2694
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,139
full season plants don't go out until

2695
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,480
um you know

2696
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:57,779
mid-july

2697
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:59,819
um but you know I do a lot of things a

2698
01:52:57,779 --> 01:53:02,039
lot of different ways so

2699
01:52:59,819 --> 01:53:04,799
this year I did

2700
01:53:02,039 --> 01:53:08,819
um a depth run I have my

2701
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:11,760
full season stuff going now I have a few

2702
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:13,679
extra plants that are out in the gorilla

2703
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,539
Spa you know I just

2704
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:18,840
I don't have

2705
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:20,539
I'm always looking for the you know best

2706
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,800
way to

2707
01:53:20,539 --> 01:53:25,618
deal with all the seeds that I bought

2708
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,699
basically

2709
01:53:25,618 --> 01:53:28,319
um

2710
01:53:26,698 --> 01:53:31,259
yeah

2711
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:35,389
chicken feed

2712
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:36,659
yeah and yeah soil mix I mean I did I do

2713
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:37,980
[Music]

2714
01:53:36,658 --> 01:53:40,259
almost

2715
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:42,658
almost fully organic

2716
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:44,760
um because I I just like a minted soil I

2717
01:53:42,658 --> 01:53:47,039
like the way plants can kind of take

2718
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:47,940
what they want when they want it

2719
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:52,618
um yeah

2720
01:53:47,939 --> 01:53:55,738
and I try to try to keep you know

2721
01:53:52,618 --> 01:53:58,759
fungus and bugs off them and kind of let

2722
01:53:55,738 --> 01:53:58,759
them do their thing outside

2723
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:03,000
yep

2724
01:54:00,359 --> 01:54:03,719
nice Okay

2725
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,639
um

2726
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:07,020
I know Matt you mentioned we probably

2727
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:09,359
wouldn't get into the hypothetical

2728
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:10,860
breeding scenarios but I thought Moon

2729
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:12,658
did have an interesting one that I think

2730
01:54:10,859 --> 01:54:14,579
is Broad enough that we could maybe dip

2731
01:54:12,658 --> 01:54:18,379
into it which is the one where you have

2732
01:54:14,579 --> 01:54:20,579
to move on the freeway three-way

2733
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:22,819
oh wow Jesus

2734
01:54:20,579 --> 01:54:22,819
Jesus

2735
01:54:22,979 --> 01:54:27,299
my God

2736
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:29,400
so his question is if you're going to

2737
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:31,260
try and make a modern four-way what

2738
01:54:29,399 --> 01:54:35,118
plants or at least what traditional

2739
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:35,119
regions do you think you might pull from

2740
01:54:36,118 --> 01:54:41,639
uh would this be like Reinventing the

2741
01:54:39,238 --> 01:54:44,039
old four-way or like a just a four-way

2742
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:47,819
hybrid of different I think a four-way

2743
01:54:44,039 --> 01:54:50,760
hybrid of your your choosing

2744
01:54:47,819 --> 01:54:53,658
um I would probably do

2745
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,659
a

2746
01:54:54,380 --> 01:55:00,359
Colombian cross to a Mexican as the

2747
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:02,579
father plant

2748
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:05,359
and

2749
01:55:02,579 --> 01:55:05,359
hmm

2750
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:11,939
I don't know it's hard to say in Afghani

2751
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,920
because it's so Broad

2752
01:55:11,939 --> 01:55:17,359
um

2753
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,359
it'd probably be

2754
01:55:18,118 --> 01:55:24,000
a Hawaiian Afghani cross to a

2755
01:55:21,238 --> 01:55:26,638
Mexican Colombian

2756
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,340
is what I would do

2757
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:30,600
and when I say Hawaiian I'm thinking of

2758
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:34,500
like a

2759
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:36,960
hybrid type you know like Island weed

2760
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:40,219
an older you know older one

2761
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,219
like that Federation

2762
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:45,300
yeah something like that you know like

2763
01:55:43,738 --> 01:55:47,339
um a lot of

2764
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:49,980
oh Hawking

2765
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:52,860
um was planted in Hawaii and they kind

2766
01:55:49,979 --> 01:55:55,198
of added in Afghani as they got it and

2767
01:55:52,859 --> 01:55:57,719
something with that influence I'm a

2768
01:55:55,198 --> 01:56:00,658
I'm a big fan of

2769
01:55:57,719 --> 01:56:02,880
Central American sativa's

2770
01:56:00,658 --> 01:56:05,939
um I really like

2771
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:08,760
Southeast Asian ones but they don't like

2772
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:12,960
the intersex traits

2773
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:15,480
that are so abundant in those

2774
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:18,600
um so I'd probably keep it um

2775
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:21,718
Central American with just a touch of

2776
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:23,280
Afghani and Hawaiian

2777
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:24,779
boom

2778
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:27,319
how about you Matt

2779
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:29,059
how would you do this

2780
01:56:27,319 --> 01:56:31,319
man

2781
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:33,420
I'd be like what's the goal what's the

2782
01:56:31,319 --> 01:56:34,439
end goal what's the end goal here I

2783
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,880
don't know it'd probably end up with

2784
01:56:34,439 --> 01:56:38,299
something blueberry though I don't know

2785
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:41,279
that's fine

2786
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:43,020
what the [ __ ] else would I do

2787
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:44,519
yeah

2788
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:46,139
okay

2789
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,980
um I think the last one that I've got on

2790
01:56:46,139 --> 01:56:52,020
my list from Ring of Fire is how has

2791
01:56:49,979 --> 01:56:55,459
your perception of the industry change

2792
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:55,460
over the years and why

2793
01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:02,219
uh well you know I

2794
01:56:58,439 --> 01:57:07,019
I have never been an industry guy

2795
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:09,960
um I don't I'm not a big fan of

2796
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:12,420
illegal weed scene in every instance

2797
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:15,060
that I've seen I've been to quite a few

2798
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:18,420
States I've seen a lot of

2799
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:21,000
um you know legal weed and it's it's not

2800
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:22,260
anything that I would want to be stuck

2801
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,079
smoking

2802
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:28,139
um I do

2803
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:29,939
I do like the

2804
01:57:28,139 --> 01:57:32,760
um

2805
01:57:29,939 --> 01:57:34,019
the easy access for home Growers I think

2806
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,880
that's huge

2807
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:39,119
um I think

2808
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:42,840
you know that that's just that's going

2809
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:46,799
to take cannabis further in the end than

2810
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:48,840
the commercialization of it I think

2811
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,279
um you know you hear a ton of people

2812
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,500
talk about

2813
01:57:50,279 --> 01:57:55,079
Niche markets and you know how there's

2814
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:57,300
going to be uh this you know top shelf

2815
01:57:55,079 --> 01:58:00,899
Market's gonna arise but I you know I

2816
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:05,940
think that's a long way off I think

2817
01:58:00,899 --> 01:58:10,138
um you know the the only way to create

2818
01:58:05,939 --> 01:58:13,259
a demand for something like that is to

2819
01:58:10,139 --> 01:58:15,719
have people you know become empowered to

2820
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:17,520
grow something different something

2821
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:19,560
unique and you know with a more

2822
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:22,320
interesting eye and you know that's

2823
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:24,420
that's something that home Growers are

2824
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:25,559
going to do and share with their Circle

2825
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:28,020
and

2826
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:30,420
um I really think that's the the most

2827
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:34,380
viable path forward for

2828
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:36,779
the betterment of cannabis is through

2829
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:38,639
um Growers and you know obvious people

2830
01:58:36,779 --> 01:58:41,759
that are really passionate about it not

2831
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:44,039
just looking for a paycheck by growing

2832
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:46,159
uh you know Warehouse of wedding cake or

2833
01:58:44,039 --> 01:58:46,158
something

2834
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:52,800
yeah for sure shout out to the homegoers

2835
01:58:50,698 --> 01:58:55,279
um I think in many ways as well like the

2836
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:58,440
last breeding series was

2837
01:58:55,279 --> 01:59:01,079
uh well for everyone but I think we are

2838
01:58:58,439 --> 01:59:03,059
also have one eye for sure on the

2839
01:59:01,079 --> 01:59:06,238
hobbyists and people at home or people

2840
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:06,960
growing in smaller spaces in general you

2841
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:08,819
know

2842
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:11,118
um yeah yeah I think that's a good

2843
01:59:08,819 --> 01:59:11,118
sentiment

2844
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:17,099
yeah I don't have much advice for people

2845
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:18,179
in big warehouses to be honest

2846
01:59:17,099 --> 01:59:20,699
okay

2847
01:59:18,179 --> 01:59:22,980
I mean yeah I mean that's you know yes

2848
01:59:20,698 --> 01:59:23,939
it's big business they're they're just

2849
01:59:22,979 --> 01:59:26,399
trying to

2850
01:59:23,939 --> 01:59:28,379
you know trying to get by trying to make

2851
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:32,219
a marketable product that moves fast

2852
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:34,020
it's just you know it's big business

2853
01:59:32,219 --> 01:59:35,819
yeah I just mean from the perspective of

2854
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:37,500
I just haven't like I wouldn't even know

2855
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:39,238
where to begin from that perspective

2856
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:41,880
because I just don't do it you know what

2857
01:59:39,238 --> 01:59:45,500
I mean so yeah everything that we do is

2858
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:45,500
definitely targeted towards uh

2859
01:59:47,039 --> 01:59:53,460
um I am out of I am done with my list of

2860
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:55,618
community questions but uh hi London you

2861
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:58,020
we did talk about one thing

2862
01:59:55,618 --> 01:59:59,279
um before this chat which was you

2863
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:02,099
mentioned that you were actually drying

2864
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:05,039
seeds at the moment did you want to like

2865
02:00:02,099 --> 02:00:07,139
just touch on give a little you know

2866
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:09,118
quick overview of like how that process

2867
02:00:07,139 --> 02:00:11,099
works for you

2868
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:13,319
uh yeah so

2869
02:00:11,099 --> 02:00:16,460
um you know when I'd shop

2870
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:20,039
plants I pretty much treat them like

2871
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:22,679
their flour to dry them I try to

2872
02:00:20,039 --> 02:00:25,139
keep the temperature as low as possible

2873
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:27,118
which is difficult this time of year but

2874
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:30,480
you know the

2875
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:31,500
you know 60 60 rule I try to get close

2876
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:34,198
to that

2877
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:37,260
um and I'll drive slow

2878
02:00:34,198 --> 02:00:39,839
um kind of let the seeds mature in the

2879
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:43,139
buds as as possible

2880
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:46,260
um a paper bag um when I when I shook

2881
02:00:43,139 --> 02:00:51,060
seeds I will dry them further

2882
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:52,699
um on screens and I like to uh once

2883
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:54,960
they're good and dry I like to

2884
02:00:52,698 --> 02:00:58,019
refrigerate them for a while kind of you

2885
02:00:54,960 --> 02:01:00,420
know simulate a winter type period

2886
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:01,080
and then I will

2887
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:03,840
um

2888
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:05,698
generally start cracking them intestine

2889
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:09,119
amounts

2890
02:01:05,698 --> 02:01:11,460
so yeah nothing nothing super fancy just

2891
02:01:09,118 --> 02:01:14,039
making sure I get as much of that

2892
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:16,198
moisture out as possible before I get

2893
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:18,479
them cold

2894
02:01:16,198 --> 02:01:20,039
no that's great you know I think these

2895
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:22,379
are just the little ways we can extend

2896
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:25,019
on you know say that seed making episode

2897
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:27,900
that we did by asking you guys about

2898
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:31,260
some of your actual processes

2899
