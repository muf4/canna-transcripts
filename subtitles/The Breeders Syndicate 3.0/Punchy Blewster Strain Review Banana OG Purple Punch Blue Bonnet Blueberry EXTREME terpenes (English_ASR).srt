cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,660
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,500
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,239
we're the traditional Market

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,619
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,679
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,280
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,140
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,280
this is the revolution

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,378
what the plan is today

27
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:06,599
is to

28
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:07,978
to get a review down

29
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,978
on

30
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:14,099
the three different Punchy selections

31
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:18,319
so I'm gonna smell and smoke some of

32
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,319
this fine Punchy friend grew

33
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,320
and uh like try to get a review down

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,019
of the different expressions and it's

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,379
kind of cool because these ones have

36
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,118
cured all out a little differently so

37
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,359
what's cool about these punches is that

38
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,040
they have uh like most Berry stuff like

39
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,478
most blueberry stuff

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,859
um it can be really strong on the plant

41
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,019
but once it's

42
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,099
once you get a chop it can go earthy

43
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,920
right

44
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,559
but a lot of stuff can especially the

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,799
blueberry stuff can cure extremely Berry

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,579
it can cure extremely chocolate it can

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,299
cure extremely what else is in here

48
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:59,339
um

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,799
there's like blueberry candy blueberry

50
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,200
cream blueberry there's this one's like

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,299
raspberry chocolate right now like in

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,459
Scent anyways but I want to see how it

53
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,200
passes to taste one of the other things

54
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,878
I noticed the other day was the one that

55
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,799
smelled completely berries tasted

56
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,318
completely black licorice which is

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,319
something new to me I've never had a

58
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,598
black licorice tasting strong Bonnet

59
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,359
um expression and this is Punchy so

60
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,699
maybe that's why like it was modified so

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,239
hard but it's impressive it's pretty

62
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:32,039
cool so I'm going to start with uh let

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,700
me see if this is hot enough first let

64
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:37,378
me see if my anal ones first

65
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,479
so I'm gonna use the rip for this

66
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:42,679
because obviously that makes

67
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:46,018
for the most accurate of flavors

68
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,459
and I'll start with number two I believe

69
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,280
number two

70
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,039
was the keeper that he ended up my buddy

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,680
who grew this ended up keeping but

72
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,299
um yeah I'll see if it's my favorite he

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,500
likes to hide the best from it he likes

74
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,540
the potency the best from it and I think

75
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,979
he liked the Terps the best from it but

76
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,959
he still wants to pop more because he

77
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,259
wants to find one that he's specifically

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,598
looking for however like like with me

79
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,878
like the number three to me so far has

80
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,158
been one of my favorites my personal

81
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,959
favorites but a lot of stuff is down to

82
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,759
preference how we smell things how we

83
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,519
taste things differently

84
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,378
so it's always cool to get different

85
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,658
perspectives on

86
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,280
the same Bud from people who have

87
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,079
experience with it

88
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,340
all right so this is The Punchy Blue

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,319
Shield number two for those who don't

90
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,658
know Punchy booster is a purple punch

91
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,000
banana OG on it

92
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:37,500
so this is the uh number two hopefully

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
this is hot enough we'll find out right

94
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,560
now

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,239
it looks like I'm going down on

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,239
something sorry guys I might be

97
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:58,199
ah there is a soft Berry in there

98
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,378
that's nice there was a soft Berry in

99
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,378
there

100
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,079
okay okay buddy I see why you get this

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,080
one this one's nice

102
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,940
all right

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,819
now I'm gonna load up another Bowl here

104
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,459
I wish that

105
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,500
uh how good is a blue sour seed I mean

106
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,758
you know it's all perspective but I know

107
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,040
that uh

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,500
I know that people love it and like if

109
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,199
you love sour there's everything from

110
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,639
Pure blueberry jam to full on burnt

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
rubber sour in and everywhere in between

112
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,199
okay

113
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,419
oh wait I'm simple that was blue three

114
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,220
no wonder that's the one that I tended

115
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,599
to like the most so far so let's see

116
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,040
what this one this is the Bluetooth so

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
this is his keeper

118
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
I was like yeah let's just keeping the

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,300
wonder why it's the one that I like most

120
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,819
so

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,660
yeah it's just strong strong deep

122
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:06,418
blueberry scent which I love

123
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,040
and like I said even after a few weeks

124
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,500
of curing they're just killing it right

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,699
now on the blue Terps

126
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,860
all right see how this one uh differs in

127
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:21,439
flavor since the scent is very similar

128
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,439
very very similar to that to the three

129
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,180
gotta wait a second while it warms up

130
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,560
oh and the other thing with the rip I

131
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,639
noticed is you gotta suck it slowly like

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,478
it's your dad

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,879
um

134
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,560
or I don't know it just it's pointless

135
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,319
to 30 seconds super hard because this

136
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,879
the air goes down so it's slow I don't

137
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,180
know that's how I felt it worked best

138
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,180
though

139
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,099
yeah

140
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,918
okay so this is the one that has a

141
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,919
full-on black licorice taste to me

142
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,100
so this is the key for his keeper is the

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,180
one that has the [ __ ] black and I

144
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,180
just think that's interesting

145
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,180
do we have the number eight just

146
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,479
raspberry chocolate like when you get

147
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,519
those uh chocolate res raspberry filled

148
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,339
chocolates from the store

149
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,180
that smell and taste is what this smells

150
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,418
like

151
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,519
is raspberry chocolate which

152
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,318
um I've seen blueberry chocolate and

153
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,538
stuff cure but I've never had this hard

154
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,259
raspberry tone with the chocolate in the

155
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:27,418
Cure

156
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,580
and I love it

157
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,978
absolutely love it

158
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,800
there's a whole lot to love about

159
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,599
um DJ's blueberry line uh you know I

160
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
mean like

161
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,879
he gets cracked on for how it was made

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,740
you know Crossing

163
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,740
sisters that were

164
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,240
narrow Leaf to broadleaf repeatedly in

165
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,978
multiple Generations it's definitely an

166
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
artistic take on breeding not a

167
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,060
scientific take

168
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,620
um by any stretch but what it did allow

169
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,660
for was a lot of really beautiful

170
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,139
Expressions to come through things like

171
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,819
raspberry chocolate and whatnot so

172
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,500
um that's special but I don't know what

173
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,600
this one tastes like under this and

174
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,300
we're gonna find out

175
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,300
we will find out

176
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,379
see if it has any of the

177
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,379
raspberry chocolate

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,098
all right you're

179
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,098
so totally Berry on the front

180
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,120
it's got great flavor

181
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,520
I know I don't taste a lot of the

182
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,460
chocolate it just tastes like blueberry

183
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,620
the scent is all raspberry

184
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,899
chocolate

185
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,579
that's a lovely taste though

186
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,258
that may be one of my favorite tastes

187
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,659
out of all three as far as the berry

188
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:46,098
goes the eight

189
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,099
ooh there's a lot going on there

190
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,639
huh

191
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,460
very interesting I like what I'm getting

192
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,199
from all these a lot

193
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,079
my buddy did a killer job on the grow

194
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,520
which of course is to me is everything a

195
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,620
lot of people say ah without shitty

196
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,779
genetics blah blah blah but without a

197
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,579
good grower what good are the genetics

198
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,659
you know like

199
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,659
it's the way I look at it

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
super Berry super super Berry

201
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,879
it goes to show you not everything

202
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,379
tastes like it smells right

203
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,819
you just want to edit and post on

204
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,139
YouTube's review I think people love to

205
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,439
hear your reviews from your own lines

206
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,240
yeah like I said yesterday yeah I'm like

207
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,458
with the reviews on the YouTube channel

208
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,759
it um

209
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,439
man it's hard to

210
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,059
it's hard to review my own [ __ ] because

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,039
I just don't want people to think oh

212
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,418
this is so self-serving who gives a [ __ ]

213
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,639
with mad stuff's like I want to hear

214
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,458
about other stuff so

215
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,699
you know there is always that um

216
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:53,278
divide there and I try to keep that in

217
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,320
consideration but at the same time like

218
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,659
yeah I'll probably that's a good idea I

219
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,399
think I'm gonna take that advice Jab

220
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:01,620
I'm already doing it right might as well

221
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,059
put it up and edit it and put it out so

222
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,980
real quickly I wanted to apologize for

223
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,319
the audio and the review uh of The

224
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,440
Punchy stuff I did it on Instagram live

225
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,860
and it was done with the uh iPhone mic

226
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,620
and is what it is so apologies there

227
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,200
um but I also wanted to end the review

228
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,480

246
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,659

matter so yeah go check it out just

248

249
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,919
you

250
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:11,338
killer job

251
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,000
doing great work great grows

252
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,100
um

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,080
yeah not much more I can say about that

254
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm I'm really happy with how these

255
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,360
turned out and uh if you dig blue

256
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,819
um it's a great place to look there's

257
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,680
also a lot of grapes in it

258
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,140
um but a lot of this stuff is cured up

259
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,120
more blue than anything to me but it's

260
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,500
also like Impressions like one of my

261
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,440
other buddies got one he thinks it

262
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,958
smells more purple Punchy so

263
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,360
I spent a lot of time in the Blue Zone

264
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,338
so I can get those fine nuances out and

265
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,620
maybe maybe I tune out some of that

266
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,079
stuff but yeah like that's the whole

267
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,299
thing about multiple people doing these

268
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,439
reviews multiple perspectives on

269
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,179
everything and that's what's most

270
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,380
important because we don't all smell or

271
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,120
taste the same

272
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,958
