00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,580
thank you

[Music]

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,059
welcome to breeder Syndicate where we

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,559
explore the history of a clandestine

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,439
scene Through The Eyes of the folks who

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,600
lived in I'm Matthew owner of Riot seeds

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,118
I'll occasionally be joined by my

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,199
co-host not soja breeder and grower from

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,879
Mendocino

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,880
welcome to the underground

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,859
so tonight

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,200
I thought we would go over a little bit

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,039
because last week a lot of you remember

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,260
um

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,859
we didn't get a lot of questions when it

16
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,839
came to the the hot slate and viroid uh

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,500
stuff so we wanted to get to a lot of

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,760
interactive uh questions for that I

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,159
guess that's I don't even know how to

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,558
word it but yeah well yeah I mean we for

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,679
for various reasons we had to kill the

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,159
comments last time so we didn't end up

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,780
seeing a bunch of people's stuff and so

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,119
I don't think the viroid is is probably

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,820
like unless I really pontificate a lot I

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,259
don't think the virus is a whole show

27
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,059
um but if people have questions if

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,359
people have general questions that they

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,420
want to ask uh tonight would be a good

30
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,700
time to uh lay them out there yeah you

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
know I thought um like one of the things

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,000
that I I really took away from the

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,879
viroid

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,618
um topic and I think this is the first

35
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,259
thing that jumped out we were talking

36
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,000
about you know the different uh I mean

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,219
different techniques people use for

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,118
cloning and if you have an edge that's

39
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,259
cut where it's a wound as she called it

40
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,780
um

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,019
I mean you can't use

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,099
arrow cloners with different strains you

43
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,679
know if you're if that's what you're

44
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,658
doing it really kind of wipes out that

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,060
whole situation from being a viable

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,979
product in this market I mean there was

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,259
there there's an aspect of that and then

48
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,060
there's like there's actually

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,299
um there's actually some new tech that

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,040
coming out for uh or not new tech but

51
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,540
there's there's new to cannabis Tech

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,820
that's kind of being pushed right now

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,819
for cloning which I think is pretty cool

54
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:12,900
and I actually uh belief or I believe I

55
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,219
should say uh is a big addition

56
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,680
um so I've seen I've seen some people

57
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,020
try to get around it but they're people

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,780
have been asking about like uh cloning

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,980
Tech uh and safe practices and then

60
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,900
there's also been a bunch of people that

61
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,579
have been asking about

62
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,680
um you know

63
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,239
and this kind of sucks too but they've

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,659
been asking you about like drying and

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,520
curing and how to get better weed uh

66
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,900
which you know to be honest like it's

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,300
it's actually one of the few things I'm

68
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,519
like hesitant to talk about because

69
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,620
I uh

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,840
um you know most corporate people grow

71
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,459
shitty weed yeah and they don't realize

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,378
what Corners to cut but then I don't

73
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,939
necessarily want to deny like a bunch of

74
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,799
like home Growers and stuff like that

75
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,300
better technique either so it's like a

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,819
weird animals aren't watching this [ __ ]

77
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,800
anyway until it turned out to be a long

78
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,839
time ago it's a weird it's a weird

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,120
conundrum so if if people want to hear

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,219
about drying and curing Tech and a way

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,200
to get better tasting weed uh you could

82
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,300
start start throwing it up in the

83
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,219
comments

84
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,680
um you know so

85
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:15,239
another another thing she addressed and

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,300
and a lot of people like I said were

87
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,420
arguing about before the uh show and

88
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,620
even after was the relevance to Hops

89
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,919
Leighton

90
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,140
showing up in the progeny of seed now I

91
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,238
I thought about it all weekend you know

92
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,158
a bunch about different clones that have

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,800
been used that we know pretty sure have

94
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,959
uh obso Latin one that I know for sure

95
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,459
had it when I got it back in the day and

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,459
we didn't know what it was at the time

97
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,280
was jesel diesel is well known to have

98
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,860
some kind of sickness and later on it

99
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,620
got tested it does have hlv

100
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,780
Jesus has been used in a lot of a lot a

101
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,439
lot a lot of stuff and we've never seen

102
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,840
any progeny from any diesel anything

103
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:00,180
show any of the dudding traits on their

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,280
own now is it in there

105
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,080
maybe but I mean

106
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,419
the progeny doesn't come up for it in

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,140
the test so I that eight percent number

108
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,818
seems awfully High I mean well one thing

109
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,500
is one thing we should probably mention

110
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,500
that's important and I think we brought

111
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,358
it up on the previous show is that most

112
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,160
of the stuff she was talking about and

113
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,079
this is where people get mad at science

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
especially like to use the covid thing

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,139
or whatever is because

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,139
if uh if science gets proven incorrect

117
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,900
they think it's all [ __ ] right

118
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,199
but that's how science is

119
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:40,019
um it's correct until somebody can prove

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
that it's it's incorrect or there's a

121
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,899
different technique and that doesn't

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,300
mean that like you know I mean it's

123
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:48,239
obviously like what we know at the time

124
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,040
yeah right and most of what there's what

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,918
most of what she was trying to express

126
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,199
to us about Hobb latent because cannabis

127
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,258
is not very well studied are other

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,199
viroids similar to hop latent

129
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,300
uh and other studies done it's there's

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,300
not a lot of work done specifically on

131
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,879
hoplate in cannabis yeah exactly so she

132
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,439
was trying to give us her best

133
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,060
explanation on what was ongoing

134
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,939
currently yeah

135
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,399
um and I think that's educated guesses

136
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,319
based on available information in other

137
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,779
cultivars or not not even just called

138
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,899
for other uh

139
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,159
I don't know species yeah and you know

140
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,719
and there's an aspect where people are

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,419
asking about false positives I think

142
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,280
with any kind of test there can there

143
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,258
there's a there's a there's a decent

144
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,258
percentage for false positives that can

145
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,120
exist and then I also think that just

146
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,160
because you get a negative test once

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,560
doesn't mean you're exactly in the clear

148
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,919
either yeah

149
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,839
um you know so I think there's that and

150
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,359
um you know sadly

151
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,879
um with the proliferation of cuttings

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,280
now these days and the lack of

153
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,139
cleanliness and stuff like that I can

154
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,719
safely say that like I mean maybe you

155
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,340
can map to speak on this before but

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
um in the early days of like clone

157
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,939
training and stuff like that nobody

158
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,758
nobody worried about this stuff at all

159
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,319
not stuff like that no no I mean in the

160
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,180
early days of Clone trading when I first

161
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,759
presentering in

162
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,319
um the term dud had barely just started

163
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,479
to even be I think it was even years

164
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,099
later a few years later that even like

165
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,099
hey this thing might be a dud I don't

166
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,060
know you know there's been for a long

167
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,280
time

168
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,918
um you know that's one one of the things

169
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,019
I think dudding dudding is a term we use

170
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,959
in cannabis to basically describe a

171
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,299
plant that's acting unhealthy yeah and I

172
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,758
don't I think that that um hop Slaton

173
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,819
can be a cause of dudding

174
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,520
um but uh you know I also think that um

175
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,100
there's a variety of other diseases and

176
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,719
probably unknown viruses yeah uh and

177
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,800
things like that that could also come up

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,880
later

179
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,978
um that are going to get spread around

180
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,240
you know

181
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:56,758
um so

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,160
you know um I think she was fair and

183
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,500
that what she told us was best knowledge

184
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,080
sure I think there's a lot of unknowns

185
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,759
and I think that a lot of like the basic

186
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,279
cleanliness and maintenance techniques

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,500
which are not common in cannabis need to

188
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,000
start getting applied

189
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,160
that's for sure

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,478
um yeah all that all that is good

191
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,220
technique I've been trying to get people

192
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,560
to do that with germinating seeds for a

193
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,539
long time using as as sterile technique

194
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,360
as they can because it does matter

195
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,759
you know um a lot of people do the the

196
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,259
old like well if a plant nature drops

197
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,300
you know the seeds in the ground

198
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,038
naturally they pop up you know I can

199
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,660
wait you know I can do whatever and put

200
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,459
whatever and you don't have to be clean

201
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,080
to pop seeds but really it does matter

202
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,598
if if you're if you're spending a good

203
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,459
amount of money on seeds it it really

204
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,759
does matter that's the highest rational

205
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:47,038
point right if you buy a two dollar pack

206
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,800
of tomato seeds and you don't get that

207
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,818
great of a germination rate uh nobody

208
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,598
cares

209
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,098
yeah if you give Matt Riot 300 and you

210
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,740
don't have good Tech and four of them

211
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,779
don't pop and now you're pissed yes so

212
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,300
because cannabis seeds our tendons have

213
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,619
a tendency to be expensive

214
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,800
um you know you probably want to take

215
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,319
the small extra steps needed to like get

216
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,020
as much success as you human as possible

217
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
yeah you know yeah

218
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,459
um

219
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,620
you know uh so you know there's an

220
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,560
aspect where as she was saying on the on

221
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,418
the show before you know I do believe

222
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,459
that there's a potential for people to

223
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:27,959
clone out of it

224
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,638
um you know you know I don't think

225
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,560
that's an impossibility but like she

226
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,440
made a very good point in that the

227
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,339
viroid is extremely tiny and all it

228
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,919
takes is one little bit of it to be able

229
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,899
to replicate itself and slowly come back

230
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:47,338
you know

231
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:49,440
um so what I actually think is uh

232
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,019
um is you know what people should

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,180
probably do is you know uh is have a

234
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,919
quarantine situation

235
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,019
um and people put plants into quarantine

236
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,778
to check for you know russets or or

237
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,159
broad mites or or other pests or things

238
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,320
like that

239
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,958
um it's probably advisable to maybe get

240
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,120
a cheap test a couple of times

241
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,619
um on an important plan yeah you know

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,940
and hopefully

243
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,500
um we'll have a situation like I was

244
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,080
mentioning before where like eventually

245
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,899
they'll make nurseries

246
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,139
um you know have a clean bill of health

247
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,419
you know I don't think so and yeah we've

248
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,059
seen we've seen any number of of clones

249
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,740
of private clone sellers have to

250
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,619
temporarily shut down their clone

251
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,180
selling because you know customers have

252
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,139
been buying expensive plants and then

253
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,139
it's ends up positive

254
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,339
um so

255
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,879
that's an interesting question about the

256
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:49,260
Superdog go ahead um well

257
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:51,419
um you know uh I would say that did I

258
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,860
there was a lot of uh when people

259
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:54,479
someone just asked for people that

260
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,399
aren't seeing it when I was we were

261
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,139
doing all of our super dog seeds did we

262
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,940
find sour Finos

263
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:06,360
uh and I would say yes we did

264
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,560
um not so much in look more in nose

265
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,019
you know

266
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,239
um there's definitely uh there's

267
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,240
definitely you know the the pathway we

268
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,620
took to sour to to Superdog is a little

269
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,180
different than what happened with sour

270
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,278
diesel

271
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,979
um but I think that when you cross skunk

272
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,679
and chem uh in certain ways you're gonna

273
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,700
get certain things that come up if you

274
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,139
look through be careful with that

275
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,920
terminology remember most people are

276
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,139
going to think you're talking about

277
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,979
skunk one when you see yeah you know we

278
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,759
actually

279
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,139
um we we actually considered today uh to

280
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,500
[ __ ] for a second we actually

281
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,759
considered doing a a whole show on skunk

282
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,919
one

283
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,720
um because it is such a it's got such a

284
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,578
long history

285
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,160
um and it's got so much misconceptions

286
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:52,919
these days but it does seem like Sam

287
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,719
skunk man might be giving a rendition of

288
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,479
his opinion

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,278
um and so maybe we can follow that uh

290
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,500
because it's always it's always good to

291
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,059
get the you know and and and then you

292
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,639
know we'll have an idea of like what

293
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,559
because lots of lots has been said yeah

294
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,240
you know he's been he's been invited on

295
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,619
the show so he knows that he has a

296
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,899
standing invitation to come on and talk

297
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,539
about anything he wants to too

298
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,339
um but but some people are clear

299
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,899
um you know because Matt you know Matt's

300
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,760
right is that

301
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,339
um you know Sam intentionally bred all

302
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,860
skunky Aroma out of skunk one for a long

303
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,899
time that was a claim yes

304
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,360
um and he's made that claim consistently

305
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,759
over a very long period of time and it

306
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,740
does seem like the first plants of skunk

307
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,360
that he brought over to Holland had a

308
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,519
little bit more skunkiness in them than

309
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,440
the later ones

310
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,399
um but uh you know there's an immense

311
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
amount of people that have been looking

312
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,759
through skunk one for skunk and not

313
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
finding it

314
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,480
um it seems like the skunk that got used

315
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,539
in sour

316
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,300
um was a blend of different skunks and

317
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:56,338
then blended into Super Skunk uh and

318
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,559
then some other accidents so it's kind

319
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,079
of it's it's not it's not a clear path

320
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,159
when you say a blend of different skunks

321
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,620
are you seeing a blend of different

322
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,600
skunk ones or are you using a different

323
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,700
term

324
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,720
um you know uh

325
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:16,079
so it's it Matt and I have Matt and I

326
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,860
have have some connections to the uh the

327
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,719
gentleman who uh bred that clone right

328
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,220
and he's given us

329
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,800
um unfortunately like a lot of these

330
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,100
Old-Timers from the 80s uh you would

331
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,359
like a well-written out lineage uh with

332
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,120
exacts

333
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,480
yeah and it was mostly he bought things

334
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,278
from sssc and from Neville that had

335
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,100
skunk in it and Blended them together

336
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:44,039
for two or three years and then crossed

337
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,320
something of that into Super Skunk

338
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,519
and then we got the skunk that became

339
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,480
famous

340
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,419
okay again are you you say skunk very

341
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,039
freely are you seeing skunk one I would

342
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,259
assume I would assume so because he said

343
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,679
he was buying think skunky things from

344
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,480
Neville and and and and and uh super

345
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,179
City the seed Club

346
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,620
right so he was he was buying hybrids

347
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,659
and he was blending them together for

348
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,820
two or three years I believe he even

349
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:15,179
referred to that line as skunky skunk

350
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,879
right skunky's Coke yeah yeah and and

351
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,919
then and then he took that line and the

352
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,879
first year that that Neville actually

353
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,679
released the super skunk okay which is

354
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,078
sort of the line that puts skunk back

355
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,539
into skunk as it were

356
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,039
um so if if if he's correct and he's

357
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,559
telling us the truth which I don't have

358
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,599
any reason to doubt it seems like half

359
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,239
of the thing that became very famous is

360
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,820
a blend of Neville's and super City the

361
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,259
seed Club work and half of it is super

362
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,800
skunk itself

363
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:50,639
from the first year of uh

364
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,259
um from 1990 yeah right and then from

365
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,700
that on there was some hermaphroditic

366
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:56,338
accidents and there was this and that

367
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,579
and it gets even more convoluted so it's

368
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:02,160
uh you know in order for in order for

369
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:04,199
Neville to find skunk he had to take the

370
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,000
skunkiest thing of skunk one that he

371
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,079
could find and cross it to a totally

372
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,360
unrelated genetic Maple Leaf yes

373
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,319
um and so you know

374
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
um

375
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,778
you know for for whatever for whatever

376
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,519
that work that is worth yeah um and yeah

377
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:23,159
someone just asked yeah there was there

378
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,379
it is it is from Virginia

379
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,059
um there was a gentleman that was uh you

380
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,259
know older than us and involved in dead

381
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,059
tour

382
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,399
um and he he did you know they did some

383
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,539
breeding but like a lot of a lot of 80s

384
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,820
breeding

385
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,159
um he didn't have a bunch of notes

386
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,199
and he didn't come out with this was

387
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,159
step one this was step two this was step

388
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:43,620
three

389
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,778
it's much more General it's like when we

390
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,019
interviewed when you when you and Kanza

391
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:54,838
interviewed Greg yeah it was a few

392
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:57,120
specifics and a lot of uh mysterious you

393
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,360
know yeah there wasn't a lot of detail

394
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,060
on the NLS as far as specifics there was

395
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,800
a couple things yeah

396
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,599
um you know so

397
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,819
um be that as it may like we're not

398
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,560
gonna actually do uh

399
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,778
um We're Not Gonna actually do a big

400
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,939
skunk one thing but in the it is

401
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,458
probably worthwhile to go over it at

402
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,459
some point but maybe we'll pick up where

403
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,500
you know we'll fill in gaps and comment

404
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,599
on what Sam is saying soon

405
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,679
yeah

406
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,240
um but anyway uh

407
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:34,379
I have just like such a much different

408
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,379
take on skunk one and everything that it

409
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,820
has to do with it like it's just it's a

410
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,399
different take because I wasn't around

411
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,800
like during those early eras to have

412
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,899
bought skunk one from like the first

413
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,359
year it was produced or ever or even

414
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,039
smoked anything like that my only skunk

415
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,440
was uh

416
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,039
stuff started much later you know in the

417
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,880
in the 2000s so my experience with it is

418
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,740
only

419
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,778
the Clones that we have left the old

420
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,360
clones that I've run of skunk one like

421
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:05,698
the cheese and other stuff like that

422
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
um and other stuff with heavy skunk one

423
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:10,559
influences that I learned over time were

424
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,239
very similar to what I am seeing out of

425
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,939
out of skunk one seed lines like the

426
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,519
pure from Flying Dutchman we got to run

427
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,760
but I didn't see anything capable of

428
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,578
producing anything like

429
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,899
the Terps we would see in super or not

430
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:27,179
terms but it's the same thing you can

431
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,159
see in super skunk and even looking at

432
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,319
everything that skunk one touches and

433
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,659
breeds outwards you just never seeing

434
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,600
anything like that in any of it well

435
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,879
it's interesting is

436
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,940
um Matt and I got to interview Corel

437
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,620
from Super sativa seed club and one of

438
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,899
the questions I can't remember if it was

439
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,759
when you asked him or with my section of

440
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,799
it but I can't remember that

441
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,980
um he did mention that the skunk that

442
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,819
got brought over in 8485

443
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,199
um

444
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,240
you know

445
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,939
um was different

446
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,159
than later open pollinations and later

447
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,318
breedings and and that type of stuff it

448
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,359
was a little raw yeah and I think even

449
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,699
Sam said that there maybe was a small

450
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,259
there was a small possibility you could

451
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,240
find something like that in there but

452
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,140
then later on it was it was basically

453
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,480
out

454
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,799
yeah and a lot of the the recent scams

455
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,558
that have been going on in the last five

456
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,199
or six years are turning on that hope

457
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:24,480
that oh my skunk is old enough that

458
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,519
you're gonna find in there this this

459
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,798
thing that Sam hadn't bred out yet you

460
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,440
know yeah and so I see some pretty cool

461
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,900
comments in the in here

462
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,298
um there's a uh people were talking

463
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,480
about pot of gold which uh product I

464
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:41,220
love pot of gold uh which is uh Hindu by

465
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,179
Skunk one and there's there was another

466
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,480
thing

467
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:48,059
um uh you know that was from the Flying

468
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,279
Dutchman and if I'm correct I believe

469
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:51,899
the Flying Dutchman was basically a I

470
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,819
don't want to say a front for Sam but

471
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,179
they seems like they bought most of

472
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:58,619
their wholesale seed stock from Sam yeah

473
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,660
um because Sam was willing to sell

474
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,479
wholesale within Holland which was legal

475
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,538
and not willing to sell retail

476
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,099
you know uh and

477
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,779
um you know there's another guy that

478
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:12,000
just asked if silver Pearl we both

479
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:15,058
describe silver Pearl differently yeah

480
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,099
uh and you know that people have been

481
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:18,480
building the same grows of the same Bud

482
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,058
too people have different

483
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,679
interpretations of the same thing you

484
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,200
know people have different uh people

485
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,059
have different um you know they get

486
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,980
different noses off things they can get

487
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:32,038
different effects off things you know

488
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,960
yeah uh and silver Pearl is actually an

489
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,240
early poly hybrid

490
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,798
yeah two so there can be different

491
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,440
Expressions off it

492
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,480
yeah yeah you know in that regardless

493
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,400
it's it's because I believe it's it's

494
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,279
early Pearl by

495
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,340
um Northern Lights by Skunk well yeah

496
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,399
yeah and early Pearl is early girl like

497
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:54,959
I mean it's it's a it's a hybrid of

498
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,460
a whole bit it's got a whole bunch of

499
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,679
different stuff it's crazy that it was

500
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,840
so consistent too like as far as its

501
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,179
Expressions being that much of a poly

502
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,399
hybrid it makes me wonder how much work

503
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,140
went into it beforehand for it to be so

504
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,820
consistent like with its Expressions

505
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,559
that it throws

506
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,939
you know there's another there's a

507
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,259
gentleman in the in the thing that was

508
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,640
saying that

509
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,558
um now we're getting a little off topic

510
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,360
but he was saying that Maple Leaf Indica

511
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,740
is probably the last thing that Scentsy

512
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,839
has that is original

513
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,079
after the Dutch raids

514
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,298
I don't believe that to be honest

515
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,379
um and I know and maybe a little bit of

516
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:33,960
history is is required there so uh Maple

517
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,539
Leaf was given to Neville by a character

518
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,700
named Jim Ortega

519
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:42,720
um and Neville sold it

520
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:45,419
um raw as you as it were uh at the seed

521
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,579
bank for about three years and then when

522
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,559
he got busted and he sold his company to

523
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,899
Scentsy seeds it disappeared off the

524
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,819
menu I think Matt for what it was like

525
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,919
about eight years it was a long time it

526
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,918
was about eight years

527
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,020
um and then it reappeared probably about

528
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,700
1999 it reappeared on scentsy's catalog

529
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,339
three or four years after Neville had

530
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,798
left and so as near as we can determine

531
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,839
that was no longer the original Maple

532
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,179
Leaf it was a hodgepodge of a few

533
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,720
different Maple Leaf phinos crossed the

534
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:18,179
skunk one yeah that Neville had uh made

535
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,058
it's made it Scentsy but was unreleased

536
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,820
so it's not pure Maple Leaf anymore

537
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:24,779
um and then on top of that after the

538
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,939
bust

539
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:30,058
um at some point Scentsy outsourced most

540
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,940
almost all of its breeding to Spain

541
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:34,678
so I I would I would love for there to

542
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,140
be some Aboriginal things from Scentsy

543
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,700
left I just don't put any Trust

544
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,538
into

545
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,058
um

546
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:44,700
you know I don't put any trust into it

547
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:48,119
I've seen stuff from Scentsy that came

548
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,759
out post you know 2000s and stuff like

549
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,558
that that looked like super skunk they

550
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,660
actually looked like it but none of it

551
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,259
it was all very simple one dominant type

552
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,779
uh sense though yeah yeah and I mean you

553
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:02,339
know skunk one sadly it's it's uh you

554
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,019
know it's got skunk in the name so

555
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,599
people really want to associate it with

556
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:08,819
that you know but uh it'll forever be

557
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,038
done every few years by the next Yahoo

558
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:13,259
that comes in and declares I've got

559
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,079
skunk I got the original skunk one it's

560
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:17,700
brand new you know I'm uh I'm a little

561
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,139
bit more people are talking in the

562
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,519
comments again so maybe we'll just kind

563
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,140
of ramble for a bit but people were

564
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,660
talking the comments I thought Scott and

565
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,000
Neville did a lot together

566
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,740
um that doesn't seem to be too terribly

567
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,220
true yeah

568
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,740
um I I I'm a little bit more of a shanty

569
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,640
backer than most in in our crew I would

570
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,319
say but what it does seem is that

571
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,538
um you know

572
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,119
Neville partnered with Shanti and

573
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:47,158
Greenhouse after Scentsy

574
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:52,259
and then Neville had a partnership a bit

575
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:54,780
with Shanti at um at uh Mr Nice seeds

576
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,960
and Neville did sell some of his old

577
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,519
collection of seeds to Shanti but it

578
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,620
doesn't seem that they were heavily

579
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,720
involved together for a lot of years in

580
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,519
actual breeding projects

581
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,740
was that the sense that you got talking

582
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:12,619
to Neville as well that's the sense I

583
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,620
got and I said I sensed a lot of um

584
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,640
yeah well a lot of you know there's you

585
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,980
know so anyway it it Shanty legitimately

586
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,679
uh by Neville's own Owen admittance

587
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,140
bought uh Neville's own club old

588
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,419
collection of seeds and they certainly

589
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,059
partnered together both at uh greenhouse

590
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,220
seeds with Arjun and at Mr Nice for a

591
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:36,960
while but in terms of them both being in

592
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,240
the same breeding room together doing a

593
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,819
lot of work over a number of years

594
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,859
it seems like as time goes on that seems

595
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,079
less likely than it was before that

596
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:47,699
would be the wildest ego battle I've

597
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,178
ever seen

598
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,720
that would be you know a a Star Wars uh

599
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,820
level ego battle that'd be cool but but

600
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,339
be that as it may maybe we could maybe

601
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,019
we could scroll back a little bit now uh

602
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:02,939
because we got we got way off topic

603
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,619
there a little bit but

604
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,720
um you know when it comes to like hop

605
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,979
latent or just clean practices in

606
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,038
general

607
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,279
um there's a there's a new you know um

608
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,140
I've seen people like get like uh um you

609
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,319
know you know like like the restaurant

610
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,360
style like you know like red ketchup

611
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,819
containers and they squirt a little bit

612
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,859
of gel into each plug and stuff like

613
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,119
that you know so you don't because one

614
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,379
of the big things is that all of a

615
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,359
sudden we're learning you don't want to

616
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,240
dip a raw cut

617
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,678
into a liquid or a gel that then you dip

618
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,779
another Raw it's basically like an open

619
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,340
wound yeah so if you don't want to

620
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,319
spread the viroid you probably don't

621
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,480
want to like share the same liquid with

622
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,619
hundreds of different open wounds it

623
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,880
would be nice if they just had a little

624
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:46,139
squeeze bottle with a little [ __ ]

625
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,120
thing

626
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,960
remember though one company used to do

627
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,819
that

628
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,140
people are doing that and that seems

629
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:53,579
cool but there is this thing that's

630
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,520
going on there's this gentleman I don't

631
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:57,298
usually give shouts out to people but

632
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,279
um

633
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:01,019
um but I'll say there's a guy on IG

634
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,658
called slow nickel

635
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,839
okay okay and he's an agronomist right

636
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,880
uh and he mostly does stuff with um you

637
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,439
know he's he mostly seems like he works

638
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,580
in the South and Central America growing

639
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,679
a lot of different kind of crops and

640
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:16,439
vegetables but he makes this really

641
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,500
interesting point um which divides with

642
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,640
me really strongly in which he does this

643
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,159
thing that's incredibly

644
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,460
counter-intuitive to me which is that

645
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,440
when you take your Rockwell pube or your

646
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,740
Rooter rapid Rooter plug or whatever

647
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,100
you're using right yeah he dips just the

648
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,740
tip of the actual cut itself into some

649
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:40,678
kind of rooting hormone yeah and then he

650
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:45,980
sticks that clone so that the actual cut

651
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,980
itself is not in the cube

652
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,880
okay so it's actually sticking out of

653
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,860
the cube right okay and the reason for

654
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,980
that is he said that what you want is

655
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:59,399
that you want that open wound to form a

656
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:02,460
hard callus yeah right and then once it

657
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,860
forms a callous then the roots shoot out

658
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,419
from there and the reason why it makes

659
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:08,819
so much sense to me is he says if you

660
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,500
leave this raw open wound and you stick

661
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,480
it in a Rockwell Cube or you stick it

662
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,700
into a rapid Rooter or something it'll

663
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,679
shoot out a bunch of roots but it's too

664
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,659
moist for it to form that hard callus

665
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,059
and then essentially you have an open

666
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:23,400
wound that allows a lot of opportunity

667
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,158
for fungal or virus or other various

668
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,740
things to get in there right which makes

669
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,778
a lot of sense yeah you know and he's

670
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,759
shown a lot of examples

671
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:35,700
um and a lot of people seem to be really

672
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,259
jiving on to his method yeah right and

673
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,778
it does make sense because if you think

674
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:42,839
of like human skin you know like it's a

675
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:45,058
big barrier against disease yeah right

676
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,558
and so you know the callus is

677
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:49,019
essentially a scab

678
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,879
yeah you form a hard scab and then the

679
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,220
roots start growing out of the you know

680
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,840
and then so that's pretty new uh for

681
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,058
people most people are just using to

682
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,500
stick the cutting into a rockable cube

683
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:00,298
or stick it into a rapid root or

684
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,038
whatever and it goes from there yeah

685
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,918
right

686
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,740
um and I actually having seen his Tech

687
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,659
and looking at it and reading about it I

688
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,940
actually I absolutely totally agree with

689
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,100
them yeah um I've been experimenting

690
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,259
with it for a while and

691
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,418
um it makes perfect sense to me and it's

692
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:19,440
changed how I do things now you know one

693
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,759
of the things that you have to do is

694
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,259
like a lot of times you'll have like an

695
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,538
insert that you'll stick into a tray

696
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:26,519
yeah and then you'll stick your rockwool

697
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:28,558
Cube or your rapid Rooter so that

698
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,538
actually the the stem that's sticking

699
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,700
out is a little elevated

700
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:34,798
yeah you see what I'm saying so it's not

701
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,080
just like touching flat against the the

702
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,179
tray itself

703
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,740
um I don't you know what the [ __ ] you're

704
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,059
talking about when it comes to hanging

705
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,620
out of the pla like how are you gonna

706
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,798
have it hanging an inch above the plug

707
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:48,778
when it doesn't float in the air so no

708
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,460
it's more like this so imagine I mean

709
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:52,798
this is this is gonna look a little

710
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,980
salacious or whatever but imagine this

711
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:58,440
is your plug yeah right and most people

712
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,319
would just stick it and leave it inside

713
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,960
but what he's saying is that have the

714
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,240
actual end about the bottom penetrate

715
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,220
the bottom side gotcha pop out the

716
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,380
bottom and then if that little callus

717
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,319
stick if that sticks out the bottom then

718
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,140
the actual cut end will Alice over hard

719
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,700
because yeah and honestly like if you

720
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,380
guys like if if you're if I'm not

721
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,179
describing it well you can look up slow

722
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,400
nickel on hygiene he has a really good

723
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,900
he has some good tutorials on a lot of

724
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,759
pictures on it

725
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,679
um but what it basically what is basic

726
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,778
technique is is just dip the rooting

727
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,419
hormone a little bit in that cut have

728
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:35,519
that cut callous or seal off like a like

729
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:38,220
a scab yeah and then it roots from there

730
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:42,359
and then it doesn't allow this big open

731
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:44,220
pathway Highway for you know fusarium or

732
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,859
disease to get up into your plant and

733
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,480
cause issues how about air embolisms

734
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:50,819
like that used to be the big thing like

735
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,380
everybody was don't get the [ __ ] and

736
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:54,418
I you know what's funny is back in the

737
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,179
day I remember Boney showed me this this

738
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,759
clone someone showed me this clone tech

739
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,980
for for put

740
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,960
Ting I just want to say for the crew

741
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,700
when I when I did the when I did my

742
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,740
little visual right there it did feel

743
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,659
slightly fifth gradish but here we are

744
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,819
you know so and for the people on audio

745
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,740
that didn't get to see he bent over and

746
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:15,599
it was real weird oh man there we go so

747
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,278
but yeah if you I don't usually plug

748
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,839
people but if you if you want to go look

749
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,419
up slow nickel he has a bunch of

750
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,699
examples and pictures on his page of the

751
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,679
tech that you can go and make and make a

752
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,840
lot of sense of and it does make sense

753
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,140
to seal the wound

754
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,759
to not have an open wound that allows

755
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,880
fungal matter and different stuff like

756
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,379
that to get in there yeah right so the

757
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,580
problem with that is that if you're

758
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,960
going to do that thing like you were

759
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:42,839
saying where you're going to inject a

760
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,058
bunch of gel into a rapid Rooter or into

761
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,500
a thing

762
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,538
um you know that's that's that's that's

763
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,819
sticking the plant into the cube again

764
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:52,558
yeah

765
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:55,798
you know

766
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,619
um so because

767
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:01,798
and you know like you were saying before

768
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:03,918
um in terms of slowing down hop latent

769
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,960
um it makes area flows shitty technology

770
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,220
yeah you really better make sure that

771
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,538
the Clones you're putting in an area

772
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,339
flow are 100 clean yeah because you

773
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:17,400
absolutely will spread it to every other

774
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:20,639
clone in that area flow yeah or in that

775
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,620
in that you know aerial cloner or you

776
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,840
know whatever whatever brand you're

777
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,058
you're familiar with it's just a bunch

778
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,619
of raw wound cuttings getting sprayed by

779
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,898
the same liquid over and over and over

780
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:33,418
and over again so it's a breeding house

781
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:35,038
for disease yeah I never liked those

782
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,320
things because I just could never keep

783
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,519
it consistently clean like all it took

784
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,678
is one little

785
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,000
pathogen vector and that was it and it

786
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,700
would be in the motor it would be

787
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,099
everywhere in those damn things

788
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,659
yeah I mean if you if the biggest issue

789
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,719
with those is that you want to keep your

790
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,820
water temperature in the mid 60s yeah um

791
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,278
that's where you get the most oxygen huh

792
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,259
yeah a chiller is kind of nice yeah and

793
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,778
then and then on top of that even if you

794
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:02,220
have fungal diseases like say pithium in

795
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,079
your water

796
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,960
um pythium can't actually reproduce

797
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,720
below 68 degrees oh interesting it

798
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,880
absolutely can't right which is why like

799
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,500
in in rivers and streams or ponds or

800
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,440
whatever if you see cold water it's

801
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,519
usually clear yeah and warm water is

802
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,659
usually not

803
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:24,418
interesting in that regard yeah um and

804
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,260
so you know they're uh

805
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,140
um

806
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,599
you know I all of a sudden my my uh I

807
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,038
apologize everyone my my comments paused

808
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,319
and now they just unpause and now

809
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,879
there's a million things going on but

810
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,579
but anyway

811
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,840
um you know cloning Tech he it does seem

812
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,240
like

813
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:45,720
um he is showing cloning Tech that makes

814
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,880
a lot of sense and just as a general as

815
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,700
a general Vibe

816
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,919
um sealing sealing off the wound

817
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,960
you know and not allowing and not

818
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,120
allowing Rock going on there is a big

819
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,798
deal yeah you know

820
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,558
um and so you know people might have to

821
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,859
change I mean I used to I used to dip

822
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:07,678
all of my cuttings in the same solution

823
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:09,778
so it really in order to slow down the

824
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,340
Hop latent or slow down other diseases

825
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,079
now that we're worried about you really

826
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:15,298
kind of have to look at like your whole

827
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,220
process

828
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:19,019
um and look at every step because you

829
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,700
can't do all you can't do most of the

830
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,440
steps right and then have a centralized

831
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,298
thing where you're screwing it all up

832
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,820
yeah I knew a lot of people who would

833
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:29,460
keep moms and use Aero cloners to you

834
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:31,798
know reinvigorate their moms you know

835
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,960
keep their rooms going and that might be

836
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,819
a technique of the past the big the big

837
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,058
problem that I used to run I used to run

838
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:40,200
aerial cloners when I ran water culture

839
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:41,579
the big issue that I had with them when

840
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,860
you're running them in soil or something

841
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:45,599
else is that if you use a rapid Rooter

842
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:47,819
you use a rockwool plug or anything like

843
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,579
that it just gives the the Clone itself

844
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:52,259
an anchor yeah you can have like a you

845
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,839
can have a rooted cutting with beautiful

846
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:56,579
Roots all coming off it and then you

847
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,319
transplant it into some soil or whatever

848
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:00,240
else and if you don't stabilize it the

849
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,339
right way there's nothing really it's

850
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,558
just a stick with some rooms and it has

851
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,699
a tendency to move around a bunch yeah

852
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,579
you know

853
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,919
so um but really what it is is that he's

854
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:14,339
shown it a bunch of times a lot of times

855
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,200
uh root rot or fusarium or pythium or

856
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,158
whatever else can go right up into your

857
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,620
plant

858
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:22,020
and a lot of times your plant can

859
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:25,019
recover but those plants end up yielding

860
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:27,599
less than others or being weaker yeah

861
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,700
and it seems like it was just an

862
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,439
unrealized weak point in a lot of

863
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,720
people's cloning method

864
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,700
which is cool because now that one of

865
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,620
the there's not been that many benefits

866
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,380
of legal weed

867
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:42,178
um in my opinion yeah um but one of them

868
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,100
might be that some actual agronomists

869
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,140
and actual people can bring some

870
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:48,959
different techniques that you know might

871
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,278
might improve uh you know cannabis

872
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,259
culture

873
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,538
um and how we do things

874
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:56,579
now before I before I forget I want to

875
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:59,819
say some things um I didn't told you yet

876
00:32:56,579 --> 00:33:02,460
but uh land race genetics I think in the

877
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:05,759
coming week or so and this is going to

878
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,500
be on their time over in Afghanistan

879
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,839
or Pakistan I can't remember which part

880
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,519
he's in right now but he's going to take

881
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,038
us through a field

882
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,639
as they're harvesting

883
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:19,919
over there live oh wow I know isn't that

884
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,419
[ __ ] cool so he's gonna try to set it

885
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,120
up with the farmers there so we can go

886
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,620
live from the fields uh in the Mideast

887
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,298
essentially to watch some of the

888
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:29,398
harvesting go down some of the technique

889
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:32,099
and maybe help us talk to some of the

890
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:35,579
farmers and translate for us so it'll it

891
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:37,918
might be at 2 A.M or 3 A.M or 4 a.m but

892
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:40,139
I'm gonna wake up and do it whatever

893
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,820
time it is because that will be freaking

894
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,980
amazing it's the other side of the Earth

895
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:46,079
Somebody commented I seen a pic of that

896
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,899
nl5 tell us about it I don't know what

897
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,720
you're talking about with that uh I put

898
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:53,158
up a pic of nl5 today

899
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,558
and it was good

900
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,140
um yeah we have a whole episode on

901
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:59,639
Northern Lights with Seattle Greg so

902
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,500
please go go watch that if you want to

903
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,240
learn about Northern Lights we have most

904
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,798
of our episodes catch something on

905
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,398
something Northern Lights at some point

906
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:10,679
you know yeah Valley thank you it's one

907
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,480
of the building blocks yeah um and

908
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,000
because it's so ancient there's a lot of

909
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,559
there's a lot of funny claims popping up

910
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,699
now

911
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,239
um about

912
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:24,000
um you know ancient nl5 lines recently

913
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:27,059
rediscovered you know this and that pure

914
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,338
Neville this that all that um yeah how

915
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:31,320
would y'all rate ml5 Haze on a one to

916
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:32,820
ten I still gotta read some more stuff

917
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,659
too real quick before we jump into all

918
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,659
that oh sorry yeah it's all right um uh

919
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,679
no don't go away go ahead I think uh I

920
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:48,659
think nl5 Hayes is the most successful

921
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,240
publicly released hybrid in marijuana

922
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:55,500
history yeah and I think there's

923
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:58,559
probably more high quality uh um clones

924
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,599
from from that line that are still alive

925
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,639
today and circulated than probably any

926
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,440
other line yeah

927
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,420
realistically speaking that's actually

928
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,760
why I rate it so highly it's not just

929
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,680
personal preference it's that there's

930
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,619
literally like usually we're lucky if

931
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,598
there's one or or two at most

932
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,119
um you know cultivars that have survived

933
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,820
from their original era that we know are

934
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,740
are it is what it is

935
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,619
um and with nl5 Haze there's probably

936
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,000
like over 10. yeah which is pretty

937
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:31,619
incredible for something that was

938
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,199
basically from 85 88 89 to uh

939
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:35,519
um you know 95 or 96 or something I

940
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,319
think it would probably be fair to say

941
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,079
cookies bad Steve stumped the [ __ ] out

942
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,480
of nl5as as far as Cuts distributed now

943
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,940
nowadays

944
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,440
um you know what I mean like I think

945
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940
that one probably swept the market

946
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,460
unfortunately I don't know about all

947
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,380
that yeah

948
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,940
I mean but but what else what I'll say

949
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,640
is that proof will be in the pudding so

950
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,079
you know um a lot of these nl5 Haze

951
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,078
cuttings that are still around and

952
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,599
capped are 25 to 30 years old right

953
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:07,440
we'll give we'll give cookie another 15

954
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,838
or 20 years and we'll see how many of

955
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,599
these original clones are held onto and

956
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,519
hoarded by Future Generations yeah um

957
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,640
because that's really the key to staying

958
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,440
power you can have all the hype you want

959
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,179
um but you know it really better be good

960
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,639
to have people keep coming back to it so

961
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,199
time will tell you know

962
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,699
um it you know one of the one of the

963
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,279
things about cookie is that it's so much

964
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:31,259
more modern than nl5 Haze you would

965
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,119
think just by the law of averages there

966
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,740
would be way more of it

967
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,200
um that would survive

968
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,699
yeah but the only reason why the only

969
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,899
reason why it's going to survive that

970
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,939
long or you're going to have that many

971
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,320
cookie Cuts survive for that long is If

972
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,320
people really love it and really

973
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:49,680
appreciate the smoke yeah

974
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,900
in my opinion I think so yeah I I think

975
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,598
you're right Cookie's probably we'll see

976
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,880
if it'll stand the test but you know I I

977
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:59,039
will say that that's not exactly a fair

978
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,559
comparison because what I was basically

979
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,460
doing is comparing things to like

980
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,960
actually released seed lines

981
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,240
you know where cookies was more like it

982
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,220
got famous as a cut and then bag seeds

983
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:14,219
occurred and then various hybrids

984
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:18,059
occurred where you know um it's not like

985
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:19,799
AK-47 or nl5 Haze or silver Pearl or

986
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,960
something where you could buy seeds of

987
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,980
it yeah for a number of years from a

988
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,900
company

989
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,000
yeah you know

990
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,338
um and then no 5 Hayes never actually

991
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,800
really ruled the market uh our buddy

992
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:34,380
crybaby is is uh is commenting on that

993
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,940
it's true Super Skunk outsold it a lot

994
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,280
Neville said there was other things that

995
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,619
were a lot more popular I'm just saying

996
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,480
that I don't think any cut I don't think

997
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,838
any seat mine has as many different

998
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,119
females that have survived as long

999
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,338
yeah I think that that might be fair to

1000
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,838
say you know I mean because there's

1001
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:53,639
there's a number of them in Europe and

1002
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,679
there's a number of them in America and

1003
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,059
you start adding all those ones up and

1004
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,539
all of a sudden you're at you know 10 or

1005
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:02,219
12 clones that are 25 to 35 years each I

1006
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,960
have a theory and I think crybaby

1007
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:05,578
probably has a similar Theory based on

1008
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,240
what we've seen I know we've talked

1009
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,579
about it is that super skunk might have

1010
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:13,259
a similar history but we just don't know

1011
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:15,660
enough about the cuts that are out there

1012
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,460
that are super skunk Cuts yet that's

1013
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:21,239
what I think well one of the things

1014
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,579
that's that is uh that really sucks from

1015
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:26,219
a historian perspective is that

1016
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,980
Americans especially are very good about

1017
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:30,480
giving counterculture nicknames to their

1018
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,400
weed

1019
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,500
um and so a lot of a lot of the original

1020
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,500
genetics that came over in the 80s and

1021
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,079
90s are obscured because they got some

1022
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,599
they got a name yeah and then we don't

1023
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,039
know what they are anymore

1024
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,480
um so we know that there was an enormous

1025
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:50,579
amount of Super Skunk that was sold

1026
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,760
but it was probably given nicknames yes

1027
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:56,180
exactly like we believe that we believe

1028
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,880
that the that it's likely that the puck

1029
00:38:56,179 --> 00:39:02,098
is a hash plant from Neville yeah but it

1030
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,920
got the nickname the puck with one crew

1031
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:08,539
and then it got the nickname the Skelly

1032
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,539
from another crew yeah

1033
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,619
you know I mean the snow I've talked

1034
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,960
about that before the snow was called

1035
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:18,000
skunk five in Florida yeah and then it

1036
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,760
was called Eugene snow in glassblower

1037
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,500
circles in Eugene it was called Humboldt

1038
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,000
snow when our buddy Caleb got a hold of

1039
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,219
it in the late 90s

1040
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,719
you know uh people talking about the dog

1041
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:29,819
[ __ ] the dog [ __ ] was called Electric

1042
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,739
Boogaloo

1043
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,300
um Matt and I Matt and I and friends of

1044
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:36,239
ours have been like debating whether or

1045
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:40,140
not we think what we think that is

1046
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:43,618
um but a lot of plants got nicknames and

1047
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:45,779
um those nicknames obscure you know what

1048
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:48,599
origin it might have come from

1049
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,420
and so far because philos is a liar and

1050
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:54,539
other groups are liars we haven't I mean

1051
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:57,059
it would be amazing if we had like a a

1052
00:39:54,539 --> 00:40:00,358
genetic ability to test things and that

1053
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:01,858
Corel and Neville and and Sirius and

1054
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,319
these various groups had their original

1055
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:06,358
[ __ ] and you could just they could just

1056
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,300
put that up into a database and then you

1057
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:11,279
could map out what came out of it yeah I

1058
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,880
have um I also have a conversation soon

1059
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,060
that I was telling you about with um

1060
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,119
uh Mrs I want to pronounce her name

1061
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:22,380
right Vergara I want to say from

1062
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,539
um

1063
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,880
um Cornell University their their

1064
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,019
cannabis reading program and I'm very

1065
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,059
interested in talking with her and she's

1066
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:32,219
interested in talking with us because

1067
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:35,578
the scientific Community is having a

1068
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:37,679
hard time understanding why the Clones

1069
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:40,019
that they have now currently are not

1070
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,419
lining up with what they're seeing in

1071
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:43,800
the actual genetic data and when I was

1072
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,599
talking with her I was like well there's

1073
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,460
a lot of reasons why because what you're

1074
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,079
given is these Legacy clones that you

1075
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,659
guys think you have probably aren't what

1076
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,099
they say they are or aren't what Leafly

1077
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:55,019
because they're they're relying a lot on

1078
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:57,420
things like Leafly for their genetic

1079
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:00,000
data like looking at oh Leafly says it

1080
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,680
is XYZ so it must be XYZ let's enter it

1081
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,059
into our little database and that's

1082
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,500
where the problem is always going to be

1083
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:09,960
with with uh Academia versus traditional

1084
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,539
Farmers because there's a pretty small

1085
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,159
group of people that know and it's even

1086
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,559
harder to know that you have the legit

1087
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,239
cut and then even for historians like

1088
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,559
Matt and I and Caleb and others and

1089
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,479
stuff sometimes like the information

1090
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,480
that we think we know gets turned on its

1091
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,039
head yeah a little bit I mean Matt and I

1092
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,119
if you want to talk about the dog [ __ ]

1093
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:29,820
for a minute

1094
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,640
um and just so everybody knows this is

1095
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,900
like absolute speculation on my part but

1096
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,019
a lot of people have thought that the

1097
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,519
dog [ __ ] is an old nl5 Hayes Fino

1098
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:40,079
right yeah

1099
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,739
um I have

1100
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:47,400
I have thought perhaps that it is a old

1101
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:49,500
silver Pearl by Hayes Fino which was

1102
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,940
called that in Neville's catalog and

1103
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,179
then later it was just called silver

1104
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,220
haze from Scentsy yeah um and that would

1105
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,899
explain why it's prettier

1106
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:59,578
that's what I would explain because it

1107
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,579
doesn't really actually look like the

1108
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:04,260
cough or the A5

1109
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:07,320
and it's not as wild as that it's

1110
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,359
actually a much prettier hybrid but it

1111
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,940
has the haze effect and it certainly has

1112
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,039
that Neville's you know that Neville's

1113
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,300
like feeling to it

1114
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:17,880
um but it looks like it has something

1115
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,760
else in it and that that strain was

1116
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,320
available from about 88 on

1117
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,380
um and was available from Neville's

1118
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,260
catalog and from Scentsy

1119
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,820
um and uh you know that's total

1120
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,560
speculation but there's not very many

1121
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,300
things that came from all we know is

1122
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,420
that it came out of Minneapolis

1123
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,820
Minnesota area in the early 90s

1124
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,700
and came West

1125
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,220
and the rest of it is just observational

1126
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:45,719
I was thinking nl5 skunk one Haze

1127
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:47,519
because I've seen a lot of pretty nl5

1128
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,618
skunk one Haze

1129
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,880
um like from from Delta 9 labs they did

1130
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:55,260
their fruit of the Gods and that was an

1131
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,940
nl5 skunk one Haze or like a uh that's a

1132
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,420
perfect example but think about it right

1133
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:03,838
now so silver Pearl times Haze

1134
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:06,960
would be early Pearl nl5 skunk one

1135
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:10,559
exactly it's it's really close so you

1136
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,079
just basically described many hairs yeah

1137
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,299
you know um and I'm not I don't that's

1138
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,700
just complete speculation on my part due

1139
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,560
to the timing of the seeds available

1140
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:21,559
what the plant is telling me the fact

1141
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,500
that the plant is prettier and quicker

1142
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:27,599
than most of the other straight nl5 Haze

1143
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,119
f1s

1144
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,099
um but it's just a guess yeah but it's a

1145
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,480
guess and I think it's fair because you

1146
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:37,019
can look at it and see

1147
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,940
if I'm looking at dog [ __ ] it has the it

1148
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:41,219
has a lot of resin production for it

1149
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,780
like an nl5 Haze if it were Nano 5 Haze

1150
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:44,818
it has really good resin production and

1151
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,920
it goes to the edges and tips of the

1152
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:48,900
leaves even on some of the um not

1153
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,059
families but bigger leaves uh water

1154
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,160
leaves that aren't families and I

1155
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:55,259
remember Neville telling me that trait

1156
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:58,139
specifically was from skunk ones so we

1157
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,660
know it has skunk one in it somewhere

1158
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:03,239
I think based on what Neville said so

1159
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:05,639
that I think your your your uh silver

1160
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,739
Pearl is very very interesting uh

1161
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,420
synopsis I mean yeah so you know could

1162
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:12,239
it be it could be you know I don't know

1163
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,880
it certainly like I said the seed the

1164
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:17,519
seed was available during the time that

1165
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,800
it popped up in Minnesota

1166
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,838
um you know there wasn't honestly barely

1167
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,780
any Haze hybrids available on the market

1168
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:28,440
then I've grown personally a lot of

1169
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,359
skunk one Haze uh from Sam yeah it

1170
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,179
definitely isn't that

1171
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:35,940
yeah it's got other things in it you

1172
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:38,399
know and so but you know it also could

1173
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,800
be uh something unknown that turns us on

1174
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,019
its head you know yeah could be

1175
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,099
uh oh boy you know people ask me about

1176
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:48,960
stem rubs uh you know stem rubs are I

1177
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,359
there there are some Terps occasionally

1178
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,699
that come off stems

1179
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:57,059
um you I would put myself in the in the

1180
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:59,279
classification of in Veg it's the rare

1181
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:01,799
plant that I get much off of stem rub

1182
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,960
and vegetative growth yeah

1183
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,359
I mean I can smell stuff but it rarely

1184
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,400
does it transfer to flour for it to mean

1185
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:10,619
anything to me other than this plant

1186
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,500
smells like this in veg I mean

1187
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,300
interestingly I lost it in the fires but

1188
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,760
that old tan Joe cut I had that was from

1189
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,640
the early 80s yeah you could be carrying

1190
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,200
a tray of of you know of one gallon pots

1191
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,900
or something and you would get whiffs of

1192
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:27,480
citrus yeah even in veg but it's pretty

1193
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,760
rare yeah I mean I always tell people

1194
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,679
like if you want to smell roadkill skunk

1195
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,760
go get like the poodle nuts cut or even

1196
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:38,039
an Urkle in veg take a cut sniff it I

1197
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,460
mean but but it does it transfer to

1198
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:43,199
[ __ ] flour unfortunately like Urkel's

1199
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,019
grape it's a very grapey it has some

1200
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,899
skunky tones in it but mostly grapey and

1201
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:51,059
sweet so yeah I mean it it not

1202
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,740
everything transfers unfortunately a lot

1203
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:55,019
of people like I've seen breeders be

1204
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:57,000
like yeah this [ __ ] [ __ ] roots and

1205
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:58,858
veg yes donkey and it's like oh yeah

1206
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,139
they give you what I mean they give you

1207
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:03,838
like a someoneiere list of smells and

1208
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,118
Aromas and maybe their schnoz is just a

1209
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,799
lot better than mine uh and their brains

1210
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,900
on a different level but I am always

1211
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,539
amazed at some of the depth that people

1212
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,338
can get off a basic stem rub I'm not

1213
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:15,779
saying it's impossible I have had some

1214
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,779
plants that definitely gave me some

1215
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,579
Terps that were identifiable in veg I'm

1216
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,400
just saying for me personally it's a

1217
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:25,800
little it's it's more rare

1218
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,358
um you know and so you know and it's

1219
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,780
usually something simple to me like

1220
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:32,759
citrus yeah it's not like oh it smells

1221
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,160
like leather with hints of raw cherries

1222
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,599
and a backbone of coffee it's it's yeah

1223
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,059
I don't get a lot of complexity it's

1224
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:41,818
usually something simple shining through

1225
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:44,039
you know on that level

1226
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:47,119
um and uh you know one thing I never

1227
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:49,559
hear is is I smell chlorophyll okay

1228
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,300
that's one thing I definitely smell and

1229
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,460
veg when I run something is a shitload

1230
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,380
of chlorophyll and people were asking me

1231
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,440
what do I think about the you know I I

1232
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:01,200
did get a couple of uh Caleb selections

1233
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,440
from Matt and Caleb's uh

1234
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,539
um nl5 outgrow that they did when they

1235
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,420
you know they grew a bunch of plants but

1236
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:11,880
I in my part of California it is

1237
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:15,180
extremely hot and nasty especially this

1238
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,280
summer in summer uh and so I was waiting

1239

1240
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,640

1280
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:56,519

1281
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:59,699
um picking out females that they like

1282
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:02,099
and seeing what's going on so we have we

1283
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:04,618
actually have some um we have some

1284
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:09,000
really big big projects coming up um not

1285
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:11,700
just me with um CSI but the whole group

1286
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,260
um so there's a few things we'll be able

1287
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,639
to talk about soon but I'm really

1288
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,560
[ __ ] stoked we got some big

1289
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:20,400
collaborations coming up with CSI on

1290
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,199
many levels so uh yeah I mean the homie

1291
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,480
what's good about the homie is that he

1292
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:26,039
uh not only does he do stuff that

1293
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,740
interests him in terms of what he thinks

1294
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:30,900
might be like um you know modern

1295
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:34,379
cultivars and stuff like that and modern

1296
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,358
hybrids but he also does reproduction of

1297
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,300
old seed stock

1298
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:42,179
um he's very willing to take uh dubious

1299
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,460
seeds with a story and run a bunch of

1300
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:46,199
them and see you know he'll let the

1301
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,539
seeds he'll let the plants tell him what

1302
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,578
he thinks of it later on yeah you know

1303
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:53,219
because uh sometimes good seed stock

1304
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:55,560
comes from scandalous characters yeah uh

1305
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:57,858
you know and all that and so you know he

1306
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:00,299
does Femme seeds regular seeds

1307
00:49:57,858 --> 00:50:03,900
experimental projects that type of thing

1308
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,000
so you know uh in a Land of like let's

1309
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,680
smash together all the most popular Cuts

1310
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,119
today

1311
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:10,980
um doing some of that other kind of work

1312
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,780
that doesn't really you know might not

1313
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,400
fly off the shelves as fast but it's

1314
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,800
still valuable is really is really

1315
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,119
important one one I was he was telling

1316
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,099
me about the other day and I was like

1317
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:23,220
because I always give him [ __ ] like

1318
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:25,680
he'll make stuff and he'll put it on his

1319
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:27,539
site sometimes and not announce it

1320
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,039
anywhere not a [ __ ] word he'll be

1321
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:30,480
like yeah no one was really interested

1322
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,519
in that and I'm like bro did you even

1323
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,318
tell anyone did you tell them because I

1324
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:36,900
didn't know that you put it out he was

1325
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:39,659
talking about a Mendo perps

1326
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:43,440
um cross to I think it was a Blackberry

1327
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:44,940
Widow from JoJo Rizzo and it was a um it

1328
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,980
was else I think it was elselayer who

1329
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,838
made it originally and Caleb took it to

1330
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,099
F3 and if if people remember Blackberry

1331
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,159
widow

1332
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,838
um it's very magenta red pretty

1333
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,460
um and Meadow perps can spit that too

1334
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:58,799
and he bred this in that red Direction

1335
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,858
and he's got an F3

1336
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,720
seed run that he did ages ago like eight

1337
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,219
years ago it's just been kept in the

1338
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:07,679
freezer you know and still got perfect

1339
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:09,598
germ rates but you never really sold

1340
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:12,719
them you know things like that blow my

1341
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,539
mind even uh multi-stage breeding of any

1342
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:18,959
kind uh in today's economic environment

1343
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:20,759
is rare yeah so it should be supported

1344
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,280
um because like most breeding projects

1345
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,559
you don't get what you want in one step

1346
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,660
yeah um Buckshot yeah the Hawaiian life

1347
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,059
was doing great in um Bakersfield heat

1348
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:31,558
Outdoors too it was it was played really

1349
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:34,980
well shockingly because we were getting

1350
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:37,019
up into the 118's 120s this year six

1351
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,358
days of over a hundred

1352
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:41,639
we uh we had California had one of the

1353
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,279
worst heat waves in modern memory

1354
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:47,460
uh just this last in the you know after

1355
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,599
Labor Day which was really unfortunate

1356
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,338
you know

1357
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,318
um it took my a lot of my friends told

1358
00:51:50,338 --> 00:51:53,578
me up in Mendo and stuff like that that

1359
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,960
they're uh they don't think their weed

1360
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,700
is nice

1361
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,579
oh I believe it because the heat wave

1362
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:01,799
yeah yeah yeah well that's weird because

1363
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:03,720
when some other breeders saying that the

1364
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,818
more heat the more skunky it is I

1365
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,759
believe so that's funny

1366
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:11,940
you know I mean I you know they're

1367
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,579
I when it gets to that extreme heat it's

1368
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:17,220
just damaging nothing's happy you know

1369
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:19,380
you don't want to be 115 118 and then 80

1370
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,239
or 90 degrees at night you know yeah

1371
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,099
that's just that's just not going to

1372
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:24,779
make anything happy and I do think that

1373
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:27,300
like one of the things that makes Mendo

1374
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,740
and Southern Humboldt Trinity and things

1375
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,660
like that one of the really nice places

1376
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:33,000
is to grow outdoor cannabis is that you

1377
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:34,799
get a nice cool stretch at night it

1378
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,318
might be 100 degrees in the daytime but

1379
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,059
it gets into the 50s at night and that

1380
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:41,880
temperature differential I think brings

1381
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,619
out the crystal content the Terps some

1382
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,599
of the development I think that make

1383
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:47,099
like I always notice that like people in

1384
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,380
like Grass Valley or people that were

1385
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:51,480
more Inland in California they would get

1386
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,519
these ginormous plants from the same

1387
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,559
strings but I didn't think they were

1388
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,300
quite as not people from there probably

1389
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,920
getting mad at me but I didn't think

1390
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,480
that they developed I didn't think that

1391
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,740
their region developed it's fair you

1392
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,318
know I just think that you know if he

1393
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:05,699
hits 55 or 60 degrees at night or 48 or

1394
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,800
something like that it brings out

1395
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:09,480
something in the Cannabis that if it

1396
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,260
only gets down to the 80s it doesn't

1397
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,260
yeah

1398
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:18,539
so you know um and I think too it's like

1399
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,160
those cold snaps uh or you know it gives

1400
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,239
the plant it's just like humans like

1401
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:23,879
they say that like one of the biggest

1402
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:25,739
dangers with heat waves is when it gets

1403
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,720
really warm at night

1404
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:30,598
um your body doesn't have a chance to

1405
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:33,000
recover from the day yeah and so one of

1406
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,338
the biggest dangers is is extremely warm

1407
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,019
nights for humans yeah and I think the

1408
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:38,639
same thing to be true for cannabis like

1409
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,500
the cool nights gives the plant an

1410
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,259
ability to recover from a really hot day

1411
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,000
yeah and if it's 88 degrees at 11

1412
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,079
o'clock at night

1413
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,719
um boy

1414
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,339
yeah there were there were many nights

1415
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,699
here where it wouldn't get under a

1416
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:57,480
hundred all night it was [ __ ] unreal

1417
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:59,039
yeah so you know so I from uh multiple

1418
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,139
friends have told me that they did not

1419
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,880
think that they don't think their plants

1420
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:05,279
are quite as which sucks for the current

1421
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,220
uh the current market and the current uh

1422
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,980
economics of things but uh it was it was

1423
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:14,818
a poorly timed Heat Wave yeah and

1424
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:17,519
unusually late you know and usually and

1425
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:19,079
yeah unusually brutal for sure

1426
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,739
so

1427
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:21,780
um

1428
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:23,219
yeah I don't know

1429
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,599
I

1430
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:26,939
I

1431
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:30,539
um but you know there's there's an

1432
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:33,720
aspect of of uh that's one of the things

1433
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:36,539
about climate change if you were

1434
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:39,179
um that uh is really interesting in the

1435
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:41,039
sense that a lot of times in not just in

1436
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:43,019
cannabis but in other agriculture you

1437
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:43,739
pick spots that tend to suit what you're

1438
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:46,199
doing

1439
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,759
yeah and if the climate shifts it might

1440
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,779
not it might not suit what you're doing

1441
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,079
as much

1442
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,240
yeah you know as an indoor grower

1443
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,839
um I didn't really take into account how

1444
00:54:54,239 --> 00:55:00,838
much uh the weather in Bakersfield would

1445
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,699
affect even indoor growing like it's

1446
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:05,338
when it gets to a certain point it's so

1447
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:07,019
brutal that that it does affect indoor

1448
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:08,159
growing even you know like trying to

1449
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:11,219
keep the house cool while you're running

1450
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,259
[ __ ] x amount of Lights it's gnarly

1451
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:15,719
it's not I mean it's hot there's a

1452
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,339
there's an old ass term we used to use

1453
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:18,299
in the height of the indoor days summer

1454
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:21,239
bud

1455
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,039
yeah summer Bud was not as nice

1456
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:26,279
yeah and you know there's a lot of other

1457
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,079
types and honestly like I uh you know

1458
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,900
where I live in Mendo like granted I get

1459
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,400
to use the outside which is nice but a

1460
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,500
lot of people would shut down in summer

1461
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,200
yeah um because they wouldn't grow as

1462
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,639
nice herb yeah and back in the day you

1463
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,139
could get away with like a little bit

1464
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,358
lesser indoor

1465
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:44,759
uh but right now the market is just ugly

1466
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:47,159
so

1467
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,680
um you know summer run bud can be you

1468
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:51,058
know there there's uh I don't even know

1469
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,879
what to talk about when it comes to the

1470
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:55,500
market uh it's ever it's ever changing

1471
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,900
and very painful and has a bunch of

1472
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,358
people very nervous and

1473
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,539
um you know so yeah I think we've delved

1474
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:05,940
into that depressive [ __ ] talk enough

1475
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:07,920
yeah where everybody's filming that that

1476
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,838
is is deeply involved in the weed scene

1477
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,579
where it's not just a hobby and even

1478
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:12,960
people that it's just a hobby look at

1479
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:14,339
the electric bills look at it look at

1480
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,619
how everything's going especially in

1481
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:18,058
California even hobby Growers are

1482
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,780
starting to not be able to afford to

1483
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:21,359
grow

1484
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,920
yeah I mean California sadly

1485
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,500
um you know its power is just through

1486
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,358
the roof yeah you know so even just

1487
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,300
keeping yourself cool like the human

1488
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:31,078
part of your family cool uh can be a lot

1489
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,660
of money

1490
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,160
yeah my mom will live in like 100 degree

1491
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:38,279
weather inside her house because she's

1492
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:40,618
an old Miser but um and if she hears the

1493
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,079
sorry Mom but um

1494
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:45,000
her electric bill this last month was

1495
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,039
like six hundred dollars which was

1496
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,079
outrageous for her she's never had

1497
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,058
anything even that [ __ ] close because

1498
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:53,760
she will live and eat without any kind

1499
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:55,859
of AC just because she's cheap and that

1500
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,480
blew her [ __ ] mind the 600 electric

1501
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:58,920
bill hit her so I would imagine

1502
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,760
everybody's having a rough time with

1503
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,800
that

1504
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,180
yeah and you know and then obviously

1505
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,300
like you know in California especially

1506
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:09,318
PG e got got made liable for a number of

1507
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:11,760
these uh incredible fires

1508
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:13,019
and so yeah I mean they you know what

1509
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,160
are they going to do declare bankruptcy

1510
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:17,460
and got a business and you don't have

1511
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:18,480
power yeah no it's a monopoly too is

1512
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,760
there a reason we're allowed to have

1513
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,159
Monopoly for an electric company

1514
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,960
it's it's not necessarily a monopoly

1515
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:27,179
because I don't you don't have PG e down

1516
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,800
there it's all the only thing we have

1517
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:30,299
the only thing you have is PG e

1518
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,220
interesting

1519
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,680
um you know the option it's the only

1520
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:37,259
option I mean it's hard to have a bunch

1521
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:39,419
of competition because who owns all the

1522
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,099
transmission lines yeah who's

1523
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,838
responsible for maintaining all the

1524
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,180
polls and all the power and all of this

1525
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:47,279
and all that it's not something like you

1526
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:50,639
can just be like oh well T-Mobile versus

1527
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,200
a T versus this versus that it's it's a

1528
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,358
little there's a lot of infrastructure

1529
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:55,919
involved yeah the water companies here

1530
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:57,420
are the same way you don't have a choice

1531
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,039
on that you don't have a choice on

1532
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,539
garbage and you don't have a choice on

1533
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,699
an electric company

1534
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:06,599
you know so

1535
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:09,179
um it uh it's you know I mean when um

1536
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,980
you know when I first moved to Mendo uh

1537
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:12,779
all the all the diesel grows in the

1538
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,800
woods or whatever you know diesel was a

1539
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:17,460
dollar

1540
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,300
yeah now it's super expensive yes you

1541
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,519
know

1542
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:23,400
um before you know I I this is gonna

1543
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:25,079
date me but like before I was I had an

1544
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,920
eight lighter before

1545
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:31,500
um before the Enron fake scandal in 2000

1546
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,420
2001 where they they lied about how much

1547
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:36,960
how like that California had a power

1548
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,639
crisis oh that [ __ ] yeah yeah and you

1549
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,760
know my eight lighter was never more

1550
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,679
than 350 bucks a month yeah and then

1551
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,140
they raised the rates right after that

1552
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:48,179
and it was 12 to 1500 a month yeah

1553
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:49,679
crazily yep

1554
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:51,179
um

1555
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:52,858
there's a great documentary on that

1556
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:54,659
called Enron the smartest guys in the

1557
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:57,980
room if anybody wants to watch anything

1558
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:00,420
on it it explains it in detail how how

1559
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:03,119
they played they played us in California

1560
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,460
and they actually got us to lock into

1561
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,260
Super long-term extremely high power

1562
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,880
rates because the governor was worried

1563
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,980
they was going to get even worse yeah

1564
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,960
and even though they went down for fraud

1565
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,659
and a bunch of the bunch of the top

1566
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,338
Executives did long prison terms we

1567
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:19,259
petitioned the federal government to

1568
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:21,420
break the contracts because they were

1569
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,700
signed with a company fraudulently

1570
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,380
cheating California yeah and the Bush

1571
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:26,939
Administration didn't let us out of the

1572
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:30,358
didn't let us out of it

1573
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:33,179
shocking so it's just been it's been

1574
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:35,460
unfortunately for California uh growing

1575
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:38,578
indoor has been increasingly expensive

1576
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,740
yeah definitely prohibitively expensive

1577
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:43,740
prohibitively expensive and uh you know

1578
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:45,959
sadly the you know the price of indoor

1579
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:47,578
is also is not heading and and you know

1580
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,280
it's not like going up with the cost of

1581
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:53,220
doing business yeah no it's crazy it's

1582
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:55,440
only soft so um it's really pinched a

1583
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:59,338
lot of people unfortunately yeah you

1584
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,179
know in that regard so

1585
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:03,358
um

1586
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:04,618
yeah I mean it uh

1587
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,420
um

1588
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:08,519
there are certain places like I think

1589
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,559
there's certain places in in like in in

1590
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:12,900
Trinity and there's other areas that tie

1591
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,420
into like hydroelectric power right

1592
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,160
where the power is a lot cheaper but

1593
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,318
everywhere that people like to live in

1594
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:22,259
California for the most part like is

1595
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:24,000
expensive yeah yeah even like I said

1596
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:27,720
Bakersfield used to be like one of the

1597
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,460
last cheap little bastions for for

1598
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:31,318
cheapness in California to be able to

1599
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:34,500
afford a home but that's done that's

1600
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:36,298
long gone now so yeah

1601
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:39,838
being poor doesn't really work in

1602
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:41,159
California too well anymore a fork

1603
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:42,838
um you know Trinity the problem with

1604
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:45,358
Trinity is just it's like you might as

1605
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:48,719
well live Swiss Family Robinson

1606
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:50,699
you know it's remote is it ever been up

1607
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:52,618
there yeah yeah my buddy was just

1608
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:54,058
Siskiyou County a Southern Oregon power

1609
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,920
and it's cheaper

1610
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:57,540
there's some hydroelectric that comes

1611
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,579
out of Oregon so there's certain

1612
01:00:57,539 --> 01:01:02,099
counties in Far Northern California that

1613
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:04,140
have way way nicer power than

1614
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:06,420
um any of the population centers where

1615
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:07,920
most of us live I actually want to bring

1616
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,139
rings on for a show I think he'd be

1617

he's pretty he's pretty sarcastic yeah

1624
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,380
yeah he is you know him and I have done

1625
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:30,118
a number of different projects together

1626
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,740
and we have a lot of similarities in

1627
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,900
terms of like our approach to things and

1628
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:37,500
stuff so yeah

1629
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:39,298
um you know yeah it uh um

1630
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,400
you know there's not

1631
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:43,679
um there's not you know there's uh you

1632
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,900
know people that that crack seeds every

1633
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:47,578
year and grow different seeds every year

1634
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,660
outside and do breeding projects every

1635
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,519
year that's

1636
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:52,798
I don't want to call them a Dying Breed

1637
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:55,739
necessarily but they're rarer than they

1638
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:58,739
used to be definitely did I tell you I'm

1639
01:01:55,739 --> 01:02:02,519
doing a new UFO podcast Tuesday

1640
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:04,318
you did not I I am gonna do my friend

1641
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:06,119
Nick and it's be called invisible

1642
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:08,099
residence and Tuesday we're going to

1643
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,099
have our first recording of us talking

1644
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:13,559
for the first time like trying to figure

1645
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:15,298
it out so yes I didn't know if you'd

1646
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,579
want to do it but I entered UFOs aren't

1647
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:19,259
necessarily your thing but yeah we're

1648
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:21,180
gonna give it a go and see if anybody

1649
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,799
gives a [ __ ] but it would be interesting

1650
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:24,598
especially from a skeptical point of

1651
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:28,139
view on UFOs

1652
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:30,480
I bet yeah he um I will say one thing

1653
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:34,019
about my buddy Rings is that he comes up

1654
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,798
with a series of very inappropriate seed

1655
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:41,159
line names and hashish names that sounds

1656
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:43,500
familiar he does I I would actually have

1657
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:46,019
to say that he might he he might have

1658
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:49,019
the most inappropriate that I'm aware of

1659
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:51,239
yeah really which one is it can you can

1660
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:53,159
you say this name can I say it can I can

1661
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:57,118
I pump him out sure

1662
01:02:53,159 --> 01:03:01,338
um do uh uh he has one called uh your

1663
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,338
sister's innocence laughs

1664
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,200

stuff's a great one that's how me and

1668
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:15,838
him first started talking about if you

1669
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:17,039
cross butt stuff to your sisters in a

1670
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:20,159
sense you really start getting places

1671
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,199
yeah you sure do he had a he had a

1672
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:24,960
hashish line for a minute that you

1673
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:26,460
remember Heaven's Gate yes because those

1674
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,559
that's probably right up your alley with

1675
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,659
all the UFO weirdos so yeah remember how

1676
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,140
they all had like the Adidas suits and

1677
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:36,719
like the shoes the Nike yeah right so

1678
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:39,179
there he he had this image of like two

1679
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:40,980
Nike shoes pointing up and then the

1680
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:43,199
Adidas jump shoot and it ends at the

1681
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,280
knees and then like and then like a

1682
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,019
spaceship

1683
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,180
you know

1684
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:51,838
um the clubs had a hard time

1685
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:54,838
uh promoting the uh the head the heavens

1686
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:57,659
gate uh the yeah the heavens gate

1687
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:00,480
hashish line it was uh it was a little

1688
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:02,940
through risque perhaps a little too a

1689
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,500
little too morbid the humor was so black

1690
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,019
it was ultraviolet

1691
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,000
yes yeah

1692
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:11,460
that's Rings humor humor so black it's

1693
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,139
ultraviolet yeah uh and then there's and

1694
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,818
then there's ones that are um that are

1695
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:17,940
worse than that that didn't even make

1696
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:19,619
the public cut so oh wow yeah I love it

1697
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,358
you know but yeah I would have to say

1698
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:22,980
there's other ones there's other ones I

1699
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,679
won't say but one of my favorite is

1700
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,659
yours I mean how do you get more your

1701
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:30,659
sister's innocence you know oh that's

1702
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:31,199
too good that's too good

1703
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:33,358
um

1704
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,578
you know but I mean he's he's actually

1705
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:37,558
been in Mendo longer than I have um I

1706
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:40,200
moved here in in 98 he moved here in

1707
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:41,760
like 94. yeah which is definitely a

1708
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:43,858
different time and so he's been here

1709
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,720
through a lot of different eras and we

1710
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:48,119
have been talking a bunch actually about

1711
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:50,159
how you know we watched an enormous

1712
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:53,160
amount of people pour into our community

1713
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,379
yeah um as the green Rush happened

1714
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:57,779
and now that the prices crashed we're

1715
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:00,660
watching all these people pour out Mass

1716
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,619
Exodus yeah yeah there was a lot of

1717
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:03,480
people that came here for different

1718
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:06,298
reasons a lot of money

1719
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,219
and as that has gotten tighter they fled

1720
01:05:06,298 --> 01:05:10,079
maybe I need to move up now when it's

1721
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:11,219
when the getting's good and everybody's

1722
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,700
gone

1723
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:17,039
yeah I mean it uh it uh where can I find

1724
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:18,719
your sister's innocence

1725
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,279
um you know your sister's innocence is a

1726
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:21,838
fleeting thing it's only there for so

1727
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,400
long and then once it's gone it's gone

1728
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,440
you know I mean it's gone it's pretty

1729
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,139
hard to get it back you know check your

1730
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,940
muscle rest up once it's uh once once

1731
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:32,219
it's gone it's gone you know it's it's a

1732
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:35,240
it's a brief period of time yeah you

1733
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:39,239
know it's a brief period of time

1734
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:40,858
so but yeah but you know Mendo Mendo is

1735
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:42,539
probably going to go back to somewhat

1736
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:44,578
depopulated and weird

1737
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:46,619
yeah because there was a lot of rich

1738
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:48,180
kids that moved up here and and faked

1739
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:49,798
being hippies or whatever in order to

1740
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:50,879
grow weed and I have spending money and

1741
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:52,139
there was a lot of people that moved

1742
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,099
here for different reasons there's a lot

1743
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:54,659
of people that came up here and bought

1744
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:56,640
property

1745
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,199
um and grew for a few years and then

1746
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,298
farmed it out to friends and went and

1747
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:03,659
lived in the bay or went and lived in LA

1748
01:06:00,298 --> 01:06:05,280
or went in Santa Rosa or whatever and

1749
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:07,440
you know got and they just like you know

1750
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,298
took a skim off the lifestyle to do

1751
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,760
whatever they wanted yeah and the

1752
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:13,619
economics of that are all trashed so

1753
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,260
it's very likely that um in the next

1754
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:19,940
four or five years a lot of uh Mountain

1755
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,940
properties are going to start popping up

1756
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:29,099
so yeah makes sense

1757
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,539
um you know and and you know Mendo Still

1758
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:33,298
Remains one of the better places to grow

1759
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:34,619
weed yeah it's just a matter about you

1760
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:37,019
know survival and whether or not you

1761
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:38,880
like to live in the country

1762
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:42,000
whether you or not you like to turn up

1763
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,760
in weird Fields with your soul missing

1764
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,920
with your soul missing yeah yeah oh no

1765
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,420
that's that's that's uh what was that

1766
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,420
show called Murder Mountain that's

1767
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:53,400
humbled isn't it that's humble yeah and

1768
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,619
that's that's that's obviously

1769
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,420
um it's exaggerated to some degree of

1770
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,280
course but it's also no but it actually

1771
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,838
is it's also true the area that they're

1772
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,000
talking about is this place called Alder

1773
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:04,619
Point Road outside of Garberville yeah

1774
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,480
and one of the things that made Alder

1775
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:08,579
Point Road pretty famous is that there's

1776
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,519
a lot of places in Humboldt Mendo that

1777
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:13,559
are big Parcels say like 40 80 160.

1778
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:16,440
that's kind of how they got divvied up

1779
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,900
uh legally yeah um and aldera Point Road

1780
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:22,079
had a bunch of you know four acre six

1781
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:24,240
acre ten acre 12 acre right so it meant

1782
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,460
a lot of weirdos got more tightly packed

1783
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:27,659
together yeah and it was a cheap place

1784
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:30,539
to land

1785
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:33,298
in Humble blow it up for a bit and then

1786
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:34,799
try to get out somewhere better

1787
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:36,358
you know so you get a bunch of weirdos

1788
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,519
all on top of each other living too

1789
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:40,078
close to each other if you're all on uh

1790
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:42,239
if you're if you if you've got a bunch

1791
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,619
of 160 acre Parcels or a bunch of 80

1792
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,199
acre personals you have some distance

1793
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:48,180
from people yeah if you have a bunch of

1794
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:50,098
three acres six acre Four Acre eight

1795
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:52,558
acre little Parcels then you're all kind

1796
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,940
of stacked up on one another yeah and

1797
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,500
then you know there's more interaction

1798
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,079
there's more weirdos

1799
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:00,420
yeah definitely uh the heels them heal

1800
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,180
weirdos

1801
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,798
so so have you confirmed with your your

1802
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,940
buddy Tom Hill if he's going to do the

1803
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:07,739
show or not

1804
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:10,798
you know

1805
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:12,838
um speaking of Hill weirdos I don't

1806
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:16,319
think it would be insulting uh we are

1807
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:19,979
hopeful we are hopeful to soon have Tom

1808
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,100
Hill on the show uh I don't think it's

1809
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:25,439
going to be Live It Won't Be Live um it

1810
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:27,120
will be it'll only be audio he's

1811
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,979
probably only going to be audio I'm

1812
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:33,119
probably going to have to go honestly

1813
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:35,698
visit him yeah um at his spot

1814
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:37,619
um but he has lived on one of the most

1815
01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:41,278
notorious areas in Mendocino County

1816
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:44,939
since the mid 80s yeah uh and so that in

1817
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,560
itself is an enormous load of stories

1818
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:48,838
he's got an immense amount of wheat

1819
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,120
history in there and then how he sort of

1820
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,759
got famous outside of Mendo and our

1821
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:56,119
little circles is he became active on

1822
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,759
the forums in the early days

1823
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:01,798
and uh Matt can speak to this too

1824
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:04,859
um you know but he was along with Vic

1825
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:07,380
High uh and a number of other people he

1826
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:12,298
was kind of a giant on the early forums

1827
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:14,579
in a way uh he created Tom Hills Hayes

1828
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:20,460
um he's credited with deep chunk which

1829
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:23,039
some people huh x18 ptk yeah all kinds

1830
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,960
of [ __ ] he he's been around a lot of the

1831
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:26,819
old school growing families and a lot of

1832
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,920
the old school growing techniques he's

1833
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:34,140
seen all the different eras from the

1834
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:36,960
camp and the 80s into the 90s into 215

1835
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:38,520
um uh you know uh deep chunk I didn't

1836
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,020
actually hear it called Deep chunk

1837
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,839
because in Mendo we called it monkey

1838
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:44,400
balls yeah

1839
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:46,500
um some people called it deep chunk some

1840
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:49,559
people called it um uh Hindu death

1841
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:51,600
cabbage uh it had a number of different

1842
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,420
names but it probably is the closest

1843
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,760
thing to an actual like I see a lot of

1844
01:09:54,420 --> 01:10:00,000
times uh the chemist is different but

1845
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,440
the chemist is also still alive uh and

1846
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,060
someone that Tom could speak on

1847
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:04,859
extensively so I'm actually really

1848
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,760
excited

1849
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:08,639
um

1850
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,219
to maybe to maybe chat with him

1851
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,739
uh and he's he's definitely a little bit

1852
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:15,779
reclusive but we're hopeful to be able

1853
01:10:13,738 --> 01:10:17,579
to do sort of like a private recorded

1854
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:18,779
thing that we could put up later yeah

1855
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:22,079
yeah

1856
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:25,738
um and he is uh to both mad and myself I

1857
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:28,979
would say uh he's sort of uh an elder

1858
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:31,619
a hero someone that both of us looked up

1859
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:34,079
to uh while

1860
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:37,140
um you know while we were learning how

1861
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,640
to how to breed I still do I mean he

1862
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,860
talked [ __ ] with the best of them too

1863
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,360
like and I don't know growing up reading

1864
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:43,859
his [ __ ] talk like the [ __ ] he would say

1865
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:46,079
I'd be like damn I want to be like that

1866
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:48,779
dude he doesn't [ __ ] take no [ __ ] no

1867
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:53,039
he was pretty famous for being caustic

1868
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:55,099
online and on on one of the lives

1869
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:57,658
um I called him a cantankerous old man

1870
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,039
uh and he reached out to me to say that

1871
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:00,599
he's mellowed

1872
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:04,019
um which is pretty funny

1873
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:06,060
um but uh yeah but but I think I think

1874
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,800
very highly of him and he's really he's

1875
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:10,679
like people throw this this term around

1876
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:14,279
lightly uh or you know too lightly in my

1877
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:18,840
opinion but Tom is a legitimate cannabis

1878
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:21,479
OG yeah I agree he's a he has he has

1879
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,760
created a bunch of uh really cool lines

1880
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:26,279
uh he's been around for an enormous

1881
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,760
amount of History he's a super character

1882
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:31,319
uh he was important in the forums

1883
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,219
um a lot of people have bred with his

1884
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:37,500
work uh he is he's a badass so every

1885
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:40,079
serious reader I know has been inspired

1886
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:42,840
by uh Tom Hill in some way in his word

1887
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,698
every serious breeder I know uh yeah

1888
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,199
he's an adult he he at this point he's

1889
01:11:44,698 --> 01:11:47,460
an elder in the in the breeding

1890
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:50,299
Community

1891
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:52,619
um and his work speaks for itself and he

1892
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:54,179
I'm not going to name where it is but

1893
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:56,880
with the some of the some of the areas

1894
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:58,800
that he's lived in for a long time are

1895
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,980
what I consider to be the Beating Heart

1896
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,800
of the Mendocino cannabis scene

1897
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:07,259
um from way back in the day uh so it

1898
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,060
would be super cool and everybody that's

1899
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,280
listening tonight

1900
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,780
um you know hopefully

1901
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,420
um he's someone to listen to he's

1902
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:19,500
someone to look up to uh and it's not

1903
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:22,140
easy to be a cannabis lifer no no no no

1904
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:24,420
um it is not uh yeah and not and coming

1905
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:27,420
from his era too like I said I say this

1906
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:29,279
all the time like it was it was just as

1907
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,899
dangerous back then to deal wheat as it

1908
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,399
was anything else so a lot of people had

1909
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:34,019
to [ __ ] with a lot of stuff and it was a

1910
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:35,579
different time you know different kinds

1911
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,400
of characters are involved so what's

1912
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:40,619
cool about that perhaps is that the I

1913
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,179
don't I can't predict exactly where the

1914
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:43,679
conversation will go I'm supposed to go

1915
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:46,020
up there and barbecue with them perhaps

1916
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,119
and maybe I'll you know have a wide

1917
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,739
ranging conversation but

1918
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:51,899
um it could you could you he could talk

1919
01:12:49,738 --> 01:12:53,218
extensively just about the history of

1920
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:55,379
where he's at

1921
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:56,760
you could talk extensively about a bunch

1922
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:58,800
of his own breeding he could talk

1923
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,360
extensively about the strains and the

1924
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,520
type of things that were around in the

1925
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:04,198
various eras

1926
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,520
um there's a lot of different directions

1927
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:10,319
you could probably have a series of

1928
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:13,560
talks with him about certain subjects

1929
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,819
and really get some places so

1930
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,739
um hopefully it happens soon he's

1931
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:18,179
expressed interest

1932
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:20,039
um he likes what Matt and I are doing

1933
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:23,219
which is extremely humbling

1934
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:24,899
yeah you know yeah I I generally didn't

1935
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:27,060
even think he knew who the [ __ ] I was

1936
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:28,439
like that's that's where it's at you

1937
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,719
know like different era different

1938
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:33,238
everything so yeah it was cool yeah

1939
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,560
super cool you know so we'll see can I

1940
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:35,759
can't predict when or how soon or

1941
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,739
whatever but there's been some interest

1942
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,380
and so when that [ __ ] happens people

1943
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:42,178
should really listen because

1944
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:44,460
um you know he's been in it to win it

1945
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:46,500
for a long time and he does have another

1946
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:48,119
interview out so Phil I think it's

1947
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,560
coming out soon so definitely keep your

1948
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:51,420
ears poke for that check it out yeah

1949
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,980
because he does he does and regardless

1950
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:55,380
of what platform it's on he's worth

1951
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:57,359
listening to absolutely um we're both

1952
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:59,100
you know I don't actually listen to a

1953
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:00,839
lot of other weed podcasts because they

1954
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,460
kind of drive me nuts

1955
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,880
um but I will be listening to that one

1956
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:07,500
because of who it who he is yeah I'm

1957
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,319
gonna listen to the podcast for that one

1958
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:12,658
I'll even give it the plug yeah I mean I

1959
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:16,799
I might even I might even listen to the

1960
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:18,479
uh to the the [ __ ] Gypsy one but I

1961
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,039
wouldn't go that far

1962
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,019
yeah I don't really I don't have any

1963
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:25,920
interest in hearing [ __ ] I'm just I'm

1964
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:27,900
just curious what what spin he spins

1965
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,279
yeah I mean you know I wouldn't

1966
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:31,619
interview that guy

1967
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:35,939
even though he's a Eve but you know but

1968
01:14:31,619 --> 01:14:38,640
I I'm curious I am a little bit curious

1969
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:39,960
um but you know we'll see I doubt that

1970
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,920
that guy will ask him the right

1971
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:45,779
questions yeah yeah okay you can only

1972
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,039
that's the thing though like if you've

1973
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:49,439
if you're new to breeding what are you

1974
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:51,658
gonna ask Tom Hill

1975
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,279
what would you know to ask him

1976
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:55,439
um what forums are left for you to

1977
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,238
peruse to to go look you know what I

1978
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:59,639
mean like it's it's it's hard it's a

1979
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:01,259
hard thing to do so it'll be different

1980
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,179
um but I'm excited either way there's so

1981
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:05,280
much I I I've been trying to research

1982
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:07,739
the chemist for many years and have

1983
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:09,840
gotten like absolutely [ __ ] nowhere

1984
01:15:07,738 --> 01:15:11,759
except for like little hints of people

1985
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,340
who met him once and like said you know

1986
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,560
XYZ but I can say I'm very interested in

1987
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,460
that I can say this uh the chemist is

1988
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,400
alive

1989
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:23,219
yeah he's in his 70s and I thought he

1990
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:25,079
was not with us I'll leave it at that

1991
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:26,819
um someone just asked he did not create

1992
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:28,019
Urkel

1993
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:31,979
um but

1994
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:34,380
um you know uh Tom has his his view of

1995
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:36,479
how Urkel happened

1996
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:38,460
um and it's an interesting one so if I

1997
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,198
get if I get a chance to go and hang out

1998
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:41,939
and we get a chance to talk that will

1999
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:43,799
probably be on the list because it's

2000
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:45,359
probably something that people would be

2001
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,219
interesting in hearing

2002
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:48,960
and to our good friends listening right

2003
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:51,899
now keep your calendar clear for

2004
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,119
December at the emerald ball it sounds

2005
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:56,039
like we may be doing another can

2006
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:57,779
Illuminati thing which is private it'll

2007
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:59,760
probably be small but for our very good

2008
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:00,539
friends who go every year and listen to

2009
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,760
this

2010
01:16:00,539 --> 01:16:06,000
um keep your calendars clear

2011
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,739
yeah we we were met Matt and I and some

2012
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,439
other close friends of ours we kind of

2013
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:12,539
threw a party for a few years for weed

2014
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:13,678
enthusiasts breeders heads various

2015
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:15,539
things like that it was pretty

2016
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,399
successful it was a really nice time for

2017
01:16:15,539 --> 01:16:20,399
people to get together and smoke a bunch

2018
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:23,039
of weed and shoot the [ __ ] in person uh

2019
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,479
it got [ __ ] by covid uh for a number

2020
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:26,579
of years but now that it seems like

2021
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,839
that's receding and times are a little

2022
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:31,260
different we're going to try to bring it

2023
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:34,460
back yeah and uh so that means I gotta

2024
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:39,600
get on uh you know having some samples

2025
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:41,579
yeah get your [ __ ] ready son yeah so

2026
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,960
yeah you know

2027
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:44,340
um so yeah I mean people can reach out

2028
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,579
about that one I'm not sure we're not

2029
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:48,719
trying to get inundated in invites if

2030
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:50,039
you're not a close friend that hasn't

2031
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,899
gone to one it's probably going to be

2032
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:53,100
smaller than the last ones even so even

2033
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,899
people that went to the last one

2034
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,820
probably won't be heading to this one

2035
01:16:54,899 --> 01:17:00,899
but but there you know there's it's it's

2036
01:16:56,819 --> 01:17:02,579
who knows it's not the the the size and

2037
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:04,319
who's coming and all that and everything

2038
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:06,840
like that not to leave anybody out but

2039
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:10,380
like we it's we're hoping it's gonna

2040
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,520
happen yes so sounds like it that's the

2041
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,199
plans

2042
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,659
you know maybe we can even do some

2043
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:17,698
content from not like live but maybe we

2044
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:19,139
could even like you know oh yeah get

2045
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:21,960
some people that year but we had too

2046
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:24,179
much fun yeah we had it was it was uh it

2047
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,819
was it was it would be hard to it's it's

2048
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:28,199
cool to not have to think there yeah in

2049
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:30,299
that regard just to be able to hang out

2050
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:33,178
and chill and

2051
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:36,960
um put any info on what cut of sour I

2052
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:39,119
have my God I don't know dude I have a

2053
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,698
lot of people that um want to

2054
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,738
confidently tell me stories about my

2055
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:45,658
headband and my sour and what they think

2056
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:48,658
it is

2057
01:17:45,658 --> 01:17:50,099
um but you know I just think that

2058
01:17:48,658 --> 01:17:52,859
there's people that want to like have

2059
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:56,400
certainty where there's uncertainty

2060
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:58,559
in my opinion it's hard you know um and

2061
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:01,019
with the recent batch of popularity with

2062
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,940
sour and headbands everyone wants to

2063
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,560
fill in the blanks on a bunch of

2064
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:06,658
different stuff you know

2065
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,640
so you know we'll have to see how that

2066
01:18:06,658 --> 01:18:09,960
goes what are your train wreck

2067
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,179
experiences

2068
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,520
I was just looking at my list here your

2069
01:18:12,179 --> 01:18:16,319
my train wreck experiences yeah yeah

2070
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,699
since you were I mean you're up in that

2071
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,920
region did you have any train wreck

2072
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:21,960
experiences what I what I'll say what's

2073
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,800
interesting about train wreck is that

2074
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:28,800
the first public thing I did as [ __ ]

2075
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:33,659
not so I guess was I showed my face

2076
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:35,760
because uh Caleb had a a cannabis event

2077
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:37,619
um that he threw and he asked me to be

2078
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,739
on the panel

2079
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:42,960
um and so I was up there with him and

2080
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:46,559
um you know a number of different people

2081
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:48,719
um Kevin Jody uh you know uh just very

2082
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,100
various folks and

2083
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,920
um one of the interesting things that he

2084
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:55,320
mentioned was that because Humboldt was

2085
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,480
such a seed-based place

2086
01:18:55,319 --> 01:19:00,059
train wreck was one of the first named

2087
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:01,439
Cuts up there that became popular yeah

2088
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,760
right

2089
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:06,678
um and one of the things that became

2090
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:09,900
popular about it was that it was Frosty

2091
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:12,179
yielded a ton and indoors it made people

2092
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:14,519
a bunch of money yeah

2093
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:16,920
and no one bitched about no one bitched

2094
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,780
about the potency either on it it was

2095
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,940
before it was before it was basically

2096
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:23,158
before Jack Herrera

2097
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:24,960
like not I don't know about before Jack

2098
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:26,460
career but it was before Jack Greer was

2099
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,399
common enough that people called things

2100
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:31,739
Jack like when people say yeah when

2101
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:33,719
people say Jack Terps

2102
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:36,238
um uh previously it was train wreck

2103
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:38,158
Terps yes even though they didn't use

2104
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:40,399
train wreck terp back then but they

2105
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,960
called it that train wreck no yes

2106
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:45,119
it was train wreck was probably one of

2107
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,500
the first Super popular Cuts in Northern

2108
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,380
California that had that strong

2109
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:53,279
terpenolin knows and there's a lot of

2110
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:55,500
mystery to it too it does not seem that

2111
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,880
um there seems to be a number of

2112
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:00,179
different train wreck cuts that float

2113
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:03,600
around yeah there seems to be debate on

2114
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:05,819
on who had what train wreck when

2115
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,679
um our buddy pack is doing has been

2116
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:09,299
doing some stuff with some old school

2117
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,859
train wreck

2118
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:14,100
um you know yeah he's made some killer

2119
01:20:10,859 --> 01:20:15,658
crosses uh there's the the GMO Mac he's

2120
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,280
done some some new school crosses like

2121
01:20:15,658 --> 01:20:20,158
the GMO map stuff but he's also like

2122
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:22,979
that blue dream train wreck one is

2123
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:25,198
[ __ ] Stellar like it it was it's hard

2124
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:27,539
to find the the old uh SD caterpillar

2125
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:31,019
dream like a lot of people some people

2126
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:32,279
just said the arcade at e32 e32 was a

2127
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,840
reference to like they thought it was

2128
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:35,279
like 32 General I mean there was there

2129
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,039
was just a bunch of different rumors

2130
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,420
about train wreck uh train wreck is an

2131
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:42,359
interesting one and then it's a little

2132
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,579
bit like Urkel in the sense that despite

2133
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:46,979
its fame

2134
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:48,119
um it doesn't have a clear storyline

2135
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:51,299
yeah

2136
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:54,300
to me yeah you know

2137
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,920
um yeah I agree yeah and I think um CSI

2138
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,840
said the same because I've definitely

2139
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,060
picked his brain on it as one of my

2140
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,039
favorite old old school California

2141
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,000
strains I picked his brain on it quite a

2142
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:05,340
bit

2143
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,500
um yeah some people some people are like

2144
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:09,360
dude that shit's too strong too racy too

2145
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,279
speedy and for me it's one of the ones

2146
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,198
that gives me anti-anxiety high it's

2147
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:14,698
[ __ ] weird and then people are asking

2148
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:16,619
various things about Sour I don't know

2149
01:21:14,698 --> 01:21:18,899
anything I don't actually like you know

2150
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:21,719
I've known JJ a long time

2151
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:24,059
I don't know what sour he has yeah you

2152
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:25,500
know uh I think JJ mostly breeds for

2153
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,960
seed

2154
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:31,380
um I haven't smoked any of JJ's actual

2155
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:32,340
flour from any of his clones he uses in

2156
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,859
a long time

2157
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:37,140
so I can't I can't really comment on

2158
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:39,059
that you know

2159
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,500
um you know yeah and you know there's

2160
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,000
aspects someone's just saying saw a

2161
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,979
couple people saying they made crosses

2162
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,560
with my cuts

2163
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:48,599
um that's nice in the sense that it

2164
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,539
appears that the podcast that Matt and I

2165
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,060
are doing is is gaining popularity a bit

2166
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:55,500
you know uh that people are saying that

2167
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:57,060
they're using my cut even though I have

2168
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,920
no idea who they are and so they didn't

2169
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:01,380
get it from me but they're pretty sure

2170
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,719
they must have what I have

2171
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:05,340
um and then I'm not obviously

2172
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:08,219
um selling any clones or anything like

2173
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:10,560
that or selling any seeds right now so

2174
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:12,658
um if people are jumping into the um

2175
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,120
people seem to be jumping into the The

2176
01:22:12,658 --> 01:22:18,420
Name Game unfortunately yeah which

2177
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:20,460
irritates the piss out of Matt but

2178
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:24,000
um and then someone just asked any info

2179
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:25,679
on original diesel uh original diesel in

2180
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,100
my opinion is a very misleading term

2181
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:31,440
there's an original diesel out there uh

2182
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:33,239
that a guy has uh that'll remain

2183
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:34,919
nameless that basically just it was the

2184
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:36,839
first diesel he got so he called it

2185
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,880
original

2186
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,739
um Matt has a nice that I have it

2187
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,300
actually Matt has a nice cut of original

2188
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:45,059
diesel

2189
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,380
um also called day wrecker which it may

2190
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,060
not even be the original cut called day

2191
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,380
record also called day record may not

2192
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,520
even be the original cut called day

2193
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,679
wrecker

2194
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:54,900
um and and uh there's a lot you know and

2195
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:56,880
Diesel also in you know I have some good

2196
01:22:54,899 --> 01:23:00,779
buddies from New York and diesel in the

2197
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:03,420
mid 90s was slang for uh Fireweed yeah

2198
01:23:00,779 --> 01:23:05,219
and and don't forget archives uh uses

2199
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:08,039
his original diesel which is the shrubi

2200
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:09,480
diesel the Amish and also referred to as

2201
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:11,579
original Diesel and I think his actually

2202
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:13,678
probably came before the day wrecker as

2203
01:23:11,579 --> 01:23:16,019
far as any kind of provenance goes or

2204
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:18,300
Providence goes on uh

2205
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:21,600
I actually uh I actually don't think

2206
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:24,960
that Jack is renamed train wreck no um

2207
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:27,179
no I don't I I disagree I do think they

2208
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,920
very strongly have a similar terpene

2209
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:31,859
profile

2210
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:34,260
um but the bud structure the high the

2211
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:36,299
way they look the way they grow uh

2212
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:38,100
there's significant differences there

2213
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:40,860
yeah someone asked me to list the new

2214
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:43,079
stuff on the site uh we have the train

2215
01:23:40,859 --> 01:23:44,880
wreck Trinity Blue Bonnet

2216
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:46,559
um that I think we've called that copper

2217
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,300
Berry because it has a lot of copyright

2218
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,239
terms the we put up some more of the

2219
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,860
pure kush Lube on it the blue bonnet bx1

2220
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:54,839
I found somewhere the triangle choke

2221
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:56,880
which we never sold we gave a bunch away

2222
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:59,400
which is the diesel uh I'm sorry

2223
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,560
triangle diesel blue bonnet and then the

2224
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:02,339
ones I named earlier so re-watch the

2225
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,199
episode

2226
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:07,199
um some I still have to add and there's

2227
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:09,899
some Hawaiian light specific directional

2228
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:12,479
open pollination breedings meaning uh me

2229
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:14,939
and Caleb's Select Cuts hit by all the

2230
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:17,039
males we isolated some of that from the

2231
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:18,960
open pollination just to keep those

2232
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:20,219
separate and um I'll have some of those

2233
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,020
up too

2234
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:23,340
and there's a bunch of stuff that people

2235
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,380
man there's a lot of comments coming

2236
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:27,000
Fast and Furious

2237
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:28,800
um people just asked how do you get rid

2238
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,579
of variegation on the chem and headband

2239
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,980
crosses uh sometimes you can't depending

2240
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:36,960
on the cross I suppose but uh chems and

2241
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:39,238
headbands tend to be very heavy feeders

2242
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,420
and they tend to be heavy calcium

2243
01:24:39,238 --> 01:24:44,899
feeders too so you could try that but

2244
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:47,460
when I say calcium I don't mean Cal Mag

2245
01:24:44,899 --> 01:24:50,158
a lot of times they don't need nearly as

2246
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:52,020
much magnesium as they need calcium so

2247
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:54,779
if you're going to try try to give it

2248
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:56,820
more calcium and try to get a product

2249
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:57,619
that does not have a bunch of Mag as

2250
01:24:56,819 --> 01:25:01,198
well

2251
01:24:57,619 --> 01:25:02,479
because you can overload uh I got a

2252
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:05,219
question for you

2253
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:08,939
what when

2254
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:10,739
what is your definition of a headband

2255
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:12,719
like like when you think of a headband

2256
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:14,399
traditionally I know there's the can of

2257
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,260
Bible definition or whatever that it was

2258
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:18,299
like a normal lights hybrid of some sort

2259
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:19,679
but when you think of headband what's

2260
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,320
the first thing that comes to mind scent

2261
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:24,539
wise or maybe high-wise or expression

2262
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:26,579
wise I mean not that this this might not

2263
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:28,260
be fair or accurate but when I think of

2264
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:30,899
headband I think of the first cut I got

2265
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:33,840
as headband which is my La

2266
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:36,479
um I think of a a diesel type plant I

2267
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,100
think of a skunky type plant

2268
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,198
um

2269
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:42,539
you know and it turns out now that Manny

2270
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:44,939
and swell and Bondo and others

2271
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:46,380
have been talking more it does seem like

2272
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:49,559
the very first cut that was called

2273
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:51,719
headband was the was the plant that the

2274
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,679
seeds of the first Sour Diesel were

2275
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:54,600
found in

2276
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:56,460
interesting

2277
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,960
and that they all claim that that's the

2278
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:01,079
case that they had a cut they called

2279
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:02,520
diesel two and

2280
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:03,779
um there was a per there was a friend of

2281
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,000
theirs in New York that called it

2282
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:07,679
headband and

2283
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,260
um there was a one of their friends

2284
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:11,819
Manny found some seeds in that diesel 2

2285
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,679
headband

2286
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:16,319
um and out of those seeds came the first

2287
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,880
uh Sour Diesel

2288
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:21,059
um there's a bunch of other headbands

2289
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:23,219
and there's a couple lumpas headband and

2290
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:25,739
the 56 day which we both consider to be

2291
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:27,539
like renamed cushes

2292
01:26:25,738 --> 01:26:29,399
um you know uh and then there's day

2293
01:26:27,539 --> 01:26:31,439
wrecker and there's other things that

2294
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:33,719
have all kind of headband was one of

2295
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:36,238
those ones that the story wasn't well

2296
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:38,279
known for a long time so it allowed a

2297
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:40,919
lot of people to claim

2298
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:42,840
the name yeah and there's probably about

2299
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,579
four or five different cuts that all

2300
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:47,219
claim to be original New York City

2301
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:48,658
headband yeah and some of those have

2302
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:51,239
been discounted

2303
01:26:48,658 --> 01:26:54,059
yes by the people that had headband

2304
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:56,519
which people probably don't like yeah

2305
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:59,280
I'm sure you know uh people talking

2306
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:02,280
about yes Jack is an is I wouldn't say

2307
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:06,000
Jack is an unworked Super Silver Haze I

2308
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:08,399
would say that that Jack is in

2309
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,560
um uh uh you know a stop along the way

2310
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:12,719
of that breeding project and Neville

2311
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,699
didn't feel it was done and so he

2312
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:17,219
reworked it for a bit and Super Silver

2313
01:27:14,698 --> 01:27:20,460
Haze and mango Haze for that matter came

2314
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:22,380
out of that later breeding project yeah

2315
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:24,239
um you know and then people are talking

2316
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,900
about you know

2317
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:27,539
um

2318
01:27:24,899 --> 01:27:30,899
you know sours and Karma sour and res

2319
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:33,179
sour according to according to you know

2320
01:27:30,899 --> 01:27:35,759
them alone or whatever you know res got

2321
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:38,520
his sour from chemdog I think an 07 or

2322
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:41,579
06 or something like that so I've seen I

2323
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:45,480
see people quoting [ __ ] clop and and

2324
01:27:41,579 --> 01:27:47,760
stuff you can't take that to the bank

2325
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:49,138
there our podcast he's done one was

2326
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,340
almost a week after the other they're

2327
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:52,800
completely conflicted with everything

2328
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:56,340
he's ever said about Sour I don't think

2329
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:58,579
it's up anymore but it was for years so

2330
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:01,500
you really have to be careful what

2331
01:27:58,579 --> 01:28:03,119
you're taking in his info and

2332
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,800
immediately repeating his facts because

2333
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,479
there's been a lot of research done on

2334
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,639
that [ __ ] somebody's asked if I wear

2335
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:11,339
glasses I do wear glasses but I'm

2336
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:14,460
nearsighted so I can't read the comments

2337
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:16,079
on uh if I have them on yeah um so

2338
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:18,658
that's why maybe I sit a little close

2339
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:20,760
and you might see me like staring or

2340
01:28:18,658 --> 01:28:23,819
whatever someone just asked about the

2341
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:26,579
Cal 106 that slow nickel is pushing I've

2342
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:27,960
never tried it yet but I did pump him uh

2343
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:29,219
as far as being an agronomist and

2344
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,020
helping with some of the cloning

2345
01:28:29,219 --> 01:28:32,579
techniques people seem to be really

2346
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:34,139
liking it

2347
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:36,899
um and that you know there's a product

2348
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:38,940
by a good friend of mine uh who owns

2349
01:28:36,899 --> 01:28:42,179
Cutting Edge Edge that's called plant

2350
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:43,399
amp that's calcium chloride and it's

2351
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:46,260
organic

2352
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:48,658
calcium separated from magnesium in my

2353
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,880
opinion is a better option for most

2354
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:53,399
plants than calmac

2355
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,219
most calmag is Created from calcium

2356
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:59,658
nitrate which I don't like as much as

2357
01:28:56,219 --> 01:29:03,359
calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate

2358
01:28:59,658 --> 01:29:06,479
and the Cannabis seems to need a lot

2359
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:09,000
more calcium than it needs magnesium so

2360
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:12,539
over dosing it hard enough with calcium

2361
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:16,020
can overdose it in magnesium and so I

2362
01:29:12,539 --> 01:29:17,698
like I like those two uh

2363
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:19,020
um I like those two products separated

2364
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:20,879
ideally

2365
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:24,480
in fact maybe I should maybe I should

2366
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:27,000
nerd out for a second and say that um

2367
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:29,039
when they were doing uh nutrients and

2368
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,859
they were doing NPK as like the three

2369
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:33,960
macro elements yeah um scientists

2370
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:36,179
considered calcium so important they

2371
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,560
actually considered it adding making a

2372
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:40,560
top four

2373
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,239
yeah so calcium missed out being up

2374
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,800
there with nitrogen phosphorus and

2375
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:45,899
potassium

2376
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,600
um as they decided to make it a

2377
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:51,359
micronutrient but they made it a sort of

2378
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:54,600
a macro micro it's probably the most

2379
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:56,880
important of the micronutrients in terms

2380
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,639
of how much plants how much plants like

2381
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,079
and I think that's I think it's Boron as

2382
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:02,639
far as what plants like but I think one

2383
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:04,079
of the most important ones is boron and

2384
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,340
I can't remember why but I remember

2385
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:07,019
hearing that so I'm just going to throw

2386
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:09,119
it in there but I mean there's there's

2387
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:12,000
there are there's all of them are

2388
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:13,738
important and if they're not present in

2389
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,500
sufficient quantities the plant I mean

2390
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:19,559
the plant needs all of them right uh

2391
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:21,840
boron in small amounts is incredibly

2392
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:24,179
important but in large amounts it

2393
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,980
toxifies things and makes it important

2394
01:30:24,179 --> 01:30:27,480
anything anything does that um and

2395
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:29,879
actually in my my neck of the woods in

2396
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:33,178
Mendo there's a lot there's regions of

2397
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:35,340
Mendo that have excessive boron in the

2398
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:37,139
water and a lot of people would have a

2399
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:39,719
great first year and okay second year

2400
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:41,639
and a horrible third year and end up

2401
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:45,239
trying to filter Boron out of their mix

2402
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:46,500
really badly because it persists yeah

2403
01:30:45,238 --> 01:30:48,479
um

2404
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:51,179
before you get going on anything else do

2405
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:52,859
you know much about uh uh power flower

2406
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:54,719
yeah

2407
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:57,839
talk a little bit about that because it

2408
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,399
used to be a staple up there and I know

2409
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,560
a lot of people used it and had some of

2410
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:03,420
their best harvests with it and then all

2411
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,480
of a sudden it was gone and why it was

2412
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:08,219
gone I love power flower I wish it still

2413
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:12,000
existed

2414
01:31:08,219 --> 01:31:13,039
um power flower was a it came in a brown

2415
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,560
bag

2416
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:18,600
it was designed to be gorilla style so

2417
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,739
you could plant directly in the bag you

2418
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,539
could throw the bag on the ground and

2419
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:23,819
make an X and plant your plant in it and

2420
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:25,800
poke some holes right yeah or you could

2421
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:28,500
put it into beds or put it into pots or

2422
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:30,960
whatever obviously uh it had enough food

2423
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,340
in it for about three months

2424
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,319
um so in that era when you were doing

2425
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:36,239
gorilla and stuff like that um and

2426
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:38,158
you're just wanting to water your plant

2427
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:41,279
but really what made Power flowers

2428
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:43,439
special was that they they were digging

2429
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:45,179
some of the mix of it came out of this

2430
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:48,000
ancient bog

2431
01:31:45,179 --> 01:31:51,420
yeah and feet bump yeah there was a peat

2432
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,219
bog and that pea fog long ago when there

2433
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:55,319
was basically like we know people

2434
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:57,719
weren't Brewing teas very much back then

2435
01:31:55,319 --> 01:32:00,719
there wasn't any of these like

2436
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:02,460
um biological fungal bacterial products

2437
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:06,960
on the market like there's a plethora of

2438
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:09,779
now and so that ancient biology really

2439
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:12,239
tended to eat the organic food contained

2440
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:15,359
within power flower and it made it a lot

2441
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:17,399
more available than other mixes yeah and

2442
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:19,019
eventually they dug they they had issues

2443
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:20,638
with the state and local and this and

2444
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:22,560
that and they dug out the bog too much

2445
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:25,199
and it was sort of a

2446
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,760
um it was environmental [ __ ] yeah they

2447
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:29,219
it just it just wasn't what it was

2448
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:31,619
anymore it was a it was a snapshot in

2449
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:33,179
time you know the green Rush the the

2450
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:34,979
people started using it people got

2451
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:36,840
really popular people started using it

2452
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:38,759
more and more they started selling more

2453
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:42,239
and more of it that led to more people

2454
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,739
that led to more more use and that led

2455
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:45,718
to the state getting involved and then

2456
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:48,359
eventually that bog ran out

2457
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:50,100
yeah I the reason I bring it up is

2458
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:52,619
because when I was talking to CSI last

2459
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:55,139
he had mentioned that the best Sour Girl

2460
01:32:52,619 --> 01:32:56,639
he's ever smoked because he's not a sour

2461
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:58,679
fan he always talks about it but he also

2462
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:01,100
says that the some of the best wheat

2463
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:03,960
he's ever smoked with sour yeah

2464
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:06,719
he has terrible taste in the weed yeah

2465
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:10,560
[ __ ] his case all my favorites he's like

2466
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:12,658
yeah I like it I breed with it yeah on

2467
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:16,320
this one he said Shabbat grew the best

2468
01:33:12,658 --> 01:33:17,819
the best sour he's ever grown but he

2469
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:19,979
would use flower power and he said he's

2470
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:21,899
never seen lemon and stuff like that

2471
01:33:19,979 --> 01:33:23,759
come out of sour before in these grows

2472
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:25,439
because it just never was able to get

2473
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:27,119
flower power again and grow with it but

2474
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:28,738
he also said it was an amazing product I

2475
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:30,119
will say that the diesel family in

2476
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:31,799
general is very sensitive to

2477
01:33:30,119 --> 01:33:34,679
environmental factors everything from

2478
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:37,800
soil to nutrient to whatever else you

2479
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:39,500
can grow sour diesel and living soil or

2480
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,060
whatever and have it come out very sweet

2481
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:44,760
yeah getting it to actually be sour

2482
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:46,679
getting it to actually be skunky uh is

2483
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,780
kind of complex

2484
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:50,880
um the diesel plants can come out like

2485
01:33:48,779 --> 01:33:52,979
they're usually good and the high is

2486
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,659
usually there but the flavor profiles

2487
01:33:52,979 --> 01:33:59,479
and all that and how they grow and how

2488
01:33:54,658 --> 01:34:03,420
the buds form uh they're very sensitive

2489
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:05,218
okay no they're very sensitive

2490
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:06,539
um I I've I was trying to say about

2491
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:08,279
someone about this today and I've

2492
01:34:06,539 --> 01:34:10,979
started taking to calling them diesels

2493
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:12,779
instead of sours and that's only because

2494
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:14,939
I've noticed that a lot of people still

2495
01:34:12,779 --> 01:34:16,920
that haven't grown like old sour cuts

2496
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:18,960
that aren't familiar with sour still

2497
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,300
think of like the citric acid Warhead

2498
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,819
type thing and apply that to what they

2499
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:25,199
expect when they smoke a sour because

2500
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:26,460
people talk about a mouth coating thing

2501
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:28,919
with sour and we know what that is

2502
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:30,539
having smoked sour but when people think

2503
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:33,000
about that and then they think of the

2504
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:35,519
word sour mouth coat and then the citric

2505
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,738
acid type sourness comes to mind I've

2506
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,600
noticed a lot of people look for that in

2507
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:41,939
their what they think would be sours and

2508
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,760
that's not necessarily what

2509
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:46,138
yeah what the name means I mean and sour

2510
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,460
is one of those things where I'm not

2511
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:49,500
going to sit here and call anybody a

2512
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:51,600
liar or anything like that because I

2513
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:54,119
wasn't there so who am I to say that but

2514
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,800
it does seem like of the people involved

2515
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:57,479
there's a couple of different stories

2516
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,639
and you kind of end up having to choose

2517
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,439
who you want to believe yeah

2518
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:03,300
um and there's some certainty about

2519
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:06,299
certain things but it does seem like it

2520
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:08,400
was a multi-stage accident

2521
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:10,260
for lack of a better way to put it and

2522
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:11,638
then it became so famous that there's

2523
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,960
some people that wanted to put a little

2524
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:16,440
bit more certainty

2525
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,600
yeah on to that you know and so

2526
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:20,698
um I uh it sounds better if you intended

2527
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:23,760
to do it you know it makes you sound

2528
01:35:20,698 --> 01:35:25,799
cooler if you meant to do [ __ ] yeah you

2529
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,440
know and so I don't I you know but

2530
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:31,020
diesel in general uh diesel Cuts

2531
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:32,579
headband cuts that whole family it's one

2532
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:35,940
of my favorite families it's some of my

2533
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:38,219
favorite smoke they are highly variable

2534
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:39,719
uh most of them are pretty good which is

2535
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:42,060
nice

2536
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:44,219
um but they are and especially right now

2537
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:46,440
with the Resurgence in popularity

2538
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:48,480
there's a lot of false Stories being

2539
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:50,519
told and a lot of like very certain

2540
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,678
Tales yeah

2541
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,239
um you know and I mean you know it'll

2542
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:56,279
probably I'll probably say this and

2543
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:58,198
regret it or whatever

2544
01:35:56,279 --> 01:36:00,119
um but there's a lot of there's a lot of

2545
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:03,119
people that are like oh my sour traces

2546
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:04,979
all the way back to 95. yeah but then

2547
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:08,279
according to the sour people the sour

2548
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:11,039
was actually found in the spring of 96.

2549
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:13,439
that would make it hard so it's uh so

2550
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:16,619
some people sour predates real Sour by

2551
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:18,238
spy by almost a year and that's why the

2552
01:36:16,619 --> 01:36:19,859
term free free was born oh yeah the

2553
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:21,479
pre-pre you know it's like how what's

2554
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:24,238
the earliest I can do it let's go six

2555
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:27,119
months earlier I know a guy

2556
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:28,559
yep you know and I I people are talking

2557
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:30,000
about various things I don't use this

2558
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:33,900
term very much

2559
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:37,079
I really dislike IBL in cannabis if you

2560
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:40,619
see the term IBL and cannabis you should

2561
01:36:37,079 --> 01:36:42,658
be extremely suspicious IBL is bait the

2562
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:44,760
only thing that I could even think that

2563
01:36:42,658 --> 01:36:49,379
I would consider to be close to an IBL

2564
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:52,199
is Tom Hill's deep chunk same yeah I I

2565
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:54,840
you see Sour Diesel I'll be IBL I [ __ ]

2566
01:36:52,198 --> 01:36:57,238
on that yeah no that's a joke I mean

2567
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,039
even even res would be like hey here's

2568
01:36:57,238 --> 01:36:59,759
my sour Divo here's all the Fino's you

2569
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:02,340
can get

2570
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,659
right under it yeah I mean you know you

2571
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:06,360
can think about you can think about

2572
01:37:03,658 --> 01:37:09,179
inbred line and it's like oh I invited a

2573
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:11,880
couple Generations it's an IDL an actual

2574
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:15,060
IBL has almost no

2575
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:17,699
it doesn't have phenos yeah it doesn't

2576
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:19,320
have pheno phenotypical it is a Fino

2577
01:37:17,698 --> 01:37:23,219
basically

2578
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:25,079
it has it has a very very very narrow

2579
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:26,880
band of expressions

2580
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:28,380
so I don't even like ibls because

2581
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,279
there's nowhere to go you get what you

2582
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,719
get

2583
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:32,158
yes

2584
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,980
you know weasel couldn't have had it

2585
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:37,019
before 96 no so there's I I don't really

2586
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:39,539
want to get into the whole sour story

2587
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:41,520
because it's extremely long

2588
01:37:39,539 --> 01:37:43,319
um and we have an episode on it and we

2589
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,820
have various things on it and all that

2590
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:47,639
but

2591
01:37:44,819 --> 01:37:48,779
um very quickly uh there was you know

2592
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:50,520
there was weed that was being bought

2593
01:37:48,779 --> 01:37:52,500
there was bag seeds found out of that

2594
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:55,199
weed there was a couple plants that were

2595
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:56,579
called diesel one and diesel two

2596
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:59,099
um that were grown out of those bag

2597
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:01,859
seeds something harmed onto the diesel

2598
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:04,199
two they sold some weed of diesel two to

2599
01:38:01,859 --> 01:38:06,000
Manny Manny found some seeds in diesel

2600
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:08,399
too he grew those up and called them

2601
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,619
Sour Diesel yeah

2602
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:15,420
and also like someone this is the if you

2603
01:38:12,619 --> 01:38:18,658
it should never be in anyone's head that

2604
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:20,399
x amount of generations equals IBL the

2605
01:38:18,658 --> 01:38:21,899
generation has nothing to do with it

2606
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:23,638
other than the fact that you can't find

2607
01:38:21,899 --> 01:38:26,638
them in early Generations because that

2608
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:30,179
would mean that's not how it works so an

2609
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:32,699
IBL means you've achieved uniformity you

2610
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:34,920
can do that in any generation

2611
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:37,198
but a bad breeder can take something to

2612
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,840
F14 and never achieve it already I'll

2613
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:42,000
say it a different way okay and maybe

2614
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,560
maybe maybe you can [ __ ] on this or not

2615
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,380
but to me

2616
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:48,179
if you get a true breeding line a true

2617
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:49,859
breeding cannabis line means that it

2618
01:38:48,179 --> 01:38:52,980
breeds true for at least one

2619
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:55,619
characteristic one trait it might breed

2620
01:38:52,979 --> 01:38:57,718
true for multiple characteristics right

2621
01:38:55,619 --> 01:39:01,079
but it has to breed true for at least

2622
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:03,840
one consistent characteristic to me a

2623
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:06,539
cannabis IBL means that it breeds true

2624
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:09,480
for basically all the characteristics

2625
01:39:06,539 --> 01:39:11,698
several yeah you know it's it's it has

2626
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:13,799
very little variation within the lines

2627
01:39:11,698 --> 01:39:15,479
what you see is what you get

2628
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,159
yeah you could probably plant out

2629
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:18,959
hundreds of them and the variation

2630
01:39:17,158 --> 01:39:22,619
within the line would be less than five

2631
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:25,260
percent yeah so it's not even desirable

2632
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:27,359
for the most part to have an IBL because

2633
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:28,860
you're really cutting off Pathways for

2634
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:32,059
people to do different things with a

2635
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:35,219
line it really feel like a a hemp Farm

2636
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:36,300
wanting to do a seed pop for Vigor and

2637
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:38,219
you want

2638
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:40,739
a uniformity without having to do all

2639
01:39:38,219 --> 01:39:42,480
the cloning that's like where idls shine

2640
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:44,099
and so most people these days they're

2641
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:45,899
like oh well I have an inbred line I

2642
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:47,639
took it two or three or four generations

2643
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:51,059
so now it's in bread

2644
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:53,940
yeah that's not an IBL an ideal infused

2645
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:57,380
line bread with inbreeding and like a

2646
01:39:53,939 --> 01:40:01,319
line bread a line that's been line bred

2647
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:03,239
can be variant and still have work put

2648
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:04,859
into it and be a line that's line bread

2649
01:40:03,238 --> 01:40:08,039
but it doesn't mean it's an inbred line

2650
01:40:04,859 --> 01:40:09,479
uh proper and the hard part about it is

2651
01:40:08,039 --> 01:40:12,179
is that

2652
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:14,099
um you know all the we can we can and

2653
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:15,539
this you know it's like IBL it's like

2654
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:18,179
what are you even trying to get out of

2655
01:40:15,539 --> 01:40:20,760
it are you trying to get something that

2656
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:22,800
like you know the only reason why an IBL

2657
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,539
would even be desirable would be if you

2658
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,579
were trying to grow a whole bunch of

2659
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:28,319
consistent plants in a field or

2660
01:40:26,579 --> 01:40:30,000
something from seed or Greenhouse or

2661
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:32,698
whatever and you wanted to grow from

2662
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,380
seed and you wanted it to all be very

2663
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:37,678
very close to each other in height

2664
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:40,079
weight branching THC this that whatever

2665
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,579
else yeah but in cannabis we like things

2666
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:43,079
to be a little bit variable so people

2667
01:40:41,579 --> 01:40:43,979
have different choices of where they're

2668
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:48,019
going

2669
01:40:43,979 --> 01:40:51,539
right and the term IBL is 99 of the time

2670
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:52,920
misused really bad yeah I used to rage

2671
01:40:51,539 --> 01:40:54,238
about it for years and then I just

2672
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,739
stopped because it just didn't matter

2673
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:58,319
people are going to use it anyways yeah

2674
01:40:55,738 --> 01:41:00,119
it just it just doesn't exist but if you

2675
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:02,279
look up the definition almost nobody

2676
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:04,139
like like I said I maybe there's a

2677
01:41:02,279 --> 01:41:06,059
couple other things that are besides

2678
01:41:04,139 --> 01:41:07,560
deep chunk deep chunks really the only

2679
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:10,139
one that comes to mind

2680
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:12,480
uh this Christmas tree Bud from from

2681
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:14,279
Caleb's pretty consistent and that's it

2682
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,799
it's it's so far and few between though

2683
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:20,340
that it's like two three things I could

2684
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:23,699
think of and inbred does not mean IBL

2685
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:26,460
yeah inbred just you know people have

2686
01:41:23,698 --> 01:41:28,619
been asking about recombinant IBL

2687
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:30,840
recombinant has to do with recombining

2688
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:32,340
the genetics and it's usually a GMO term

2689
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,319
so is someone saying they're doing

2690
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,060
recombinant IBL work they're not using

2691
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:38,279
the term correctly I have no clue what

2692
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:42,199
they're talking about

2693
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:45,719
you know Rob Clark's book says F7 is ivl

2694
01:41:42,198 --> 01:41:47,638
no it's not you know no and Rob Clark

2695
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:49,439
also did good breeding understood

2696
01:41:47,639 --> 01:41:51,840
breeding to him he might have been able

2697
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:52,799
to take something to IBL at an F7 that

2698
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,139
would make sense because he understood

2699
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:58,020
the term he understood all that

2700
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:59,400
F7 does not equal IBL though you could

2701
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:01,199
take something that's incredibly

2702
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:04,079
different like something from Bodhi

2703
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:06,118
that's like a wild Cambodian and cross

2704
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:07,738
it with some Afghan and take it seven

2705
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:10,920
generations and it wouldn't even be

2706
01:42:07,738 --> 01:42:12,658
close to IBL yeah like there's no

2707
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:14,639
there's no set amount of generations

2708
01:42:12,658 --> 01:42:16,439
that gets there you either get there or

2709
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:18,900
you don't yes

2710
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:20,759
it's it's crazy because it seems like

2711
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:22,500
wow that's a really easy way to describe

2712
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:26,159
it is like it's just as simple as that

2713
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:28,079
is it uniform no not ideal that's all

2714
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:29,638
you ever have to know about it and then

2715
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:32,158
the other thing about it is is that like

2716
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:34,380
when people are doing like f gens in

2717
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:36,899
regular breeding the size of the

2718
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:38,760
generation is so much larger

2719
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:40,799
you know and the population they're

2720
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:43,139
picking at each F gen is so much larger

2721
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:46,199
than most small-scale hobbyist cannabis

2722
01:42:43,139 --> 01:42:48,840
breeding that doing an ideal doing an

2723
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:51,000
IBL project is just is just outside the

2724
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,739
purview of most people's spacing

2725
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,479
and another term that gets used of

2726
01:42:52,738 --> 01:42:56,939
course in cannabis and I do it all the

2727
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:58,979
time this is F1 the actual term F1

2728
01:42:56,939 --> 01:43:00,419
because most cannabis now that we work

2729
01:42:58,979 --> 01:43:03,000
with unless we're working with like

2730
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:04,440
[ __ ] land races or old heirloom lines

2731
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,920
they're going to be modern lines that

2732
01:43:04,439 --> 01:43:09,658
are hybrids or poly hybrids or poly

2733
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:11,639
polypoli hybrids you know and trying to

2734
01:43:09,658 --> 01:43:13,618
in in the definition of F1 it's

2735
01:43:11,639 --> 01:43:16,139
combining two distinctly different

2736
01:43:13,618 --> 01:43:17,759
genotypes well a lot of these are not

2737
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:19,859
distinctly different a lot of these are

2738
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:23,400
you know basically Afghani type

2739
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:25,380
Expressions to the extreme you know and

2740
01:43:23,399 --> 01:43:27,238
um if you're Crossing two light types

2741
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:29,100
that's not an F1 but we don't really

2742
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:32,218
have specific terms in cannabis because

2743
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:34,380
it's such a a wildly unique

2744
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:36,060
um crop so I don't know if there's any

2745
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:38,039
correct terms for stuff like like

2746
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:40,260
polyhybrid X polyhybrid it's not quite

2747
01:43:38,039 --> 01:43:41,939
an F1 you know I mean people someone

2748
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:44,280
just asked what's the point of going so

2749
01:43:41,939 --> 01:43:47,279
many generations in general

2750
01:43:44,279 --> 01:43:49,800
I will say that in general most breeding

2751
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:52,259
these days is one step only

2752
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,760
yeah um to be old school breeding and to

2753
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:55,500
use these terms that get thrown around

2754
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,539
in cannabis

2755
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:59,279
um you know to do a bunch of stages of

2756
01:43:57,539 --> 01:44:01,500
breeding you would have to have a goal

2757
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:03,238
of what you're trying to achieve and

2758
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:04,859
then however many generations it takes

2759
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:08,399
you until you feel like you've hit that

2760
01:44:04,859 --> 01:44:09,719
goal yeah that's really what it's about

2761
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:11,399
you know

2762
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:13,859
um and there's no set amount of you

2763
01:44:11,399 --> 01:44:15,658
could hit that generation in F3 or F4 or

2764
01:44:13,859 --> 01:44:17,039
it could take you to F7 or f8 or it

2765
01:44:15,658 --> 01:44:20,219
could take you to F10

2766
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:24,118
or whatever you know yeah

2767
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:25,980
um it it very much depends on your goals

2768
01:44:24,118 --> 01:44:28,019
and what you're trying to stabilize

2769
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:30,599
within the line and then the other thing

2770
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,679
is that like I said you can have a true

2771
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,600
breeding

2772
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:36,658
you can have a true breeding line that's

2773
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:39,659
only true breeding for one trait

2774
01:44:36,658 --> 01:44:41,579
right the more traits that you try to

2775
01:44:39,658 --> 01:44:43,859
make true breeding within the same line

2776
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:46,800
the harder it is

2777
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:48,960
yes yes so you know you try to make

2778
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:52,199
something that's extreme like like uh

2779
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:54,600
skunk one can is is true breeding for

2780
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:57,559
the most part for a few things yes right

2781
01:44:54,600 --> 01:45:00,600
it's got great calyx to Leaf ratio

2782
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:02,159
you know uh you know it's it's got a few

2783
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,020
different things but it's got got the

2784
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:05,819
resin trait that Neville talked about

2785
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:07,800
that's very visible it's got the resin

2786
01:45:05,819 --> 01:45:10,019
trait you know it's got It's got a

2787
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:13,139
certain what people call skunkoid type

2788
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:15,659
you know bud structure a lot right yeah

2789
01:45:13,139 --> 01:45:17,460
um but you know it has a range of

2790
01:45:15,658 --> 01:45:19,439
terpene profiles

2791
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:21,480
yeah you know it has a range of other

2792
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:23,479
aspects it's not true breeding in every

2793
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:27,000
aspect it's true breeding in a few

2794
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:28,500
traits that tended to be useful so it

2795
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,198
tended to be bred to a lot of different

2796
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:33,359
things so the more true breeding traits

2797
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:35,039
you try to add in the harder your

2798
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:38,880
project becomes

2799
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:41,039
yeah I've noticed that DJ despite DJ's

2800
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:44,880
uh work with blueberry being very odd

2801
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:44,880
doing constant different

2802
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:50,760
constant F ones of every filial

2803
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:52,980
generation meaning two different types

2804
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:55,260
inside the line which is not usually

2805
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:57,000
done despite that a lot of the blueberry

2806
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:59,400
stuff I found can be really good at

2807
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,960
breeding true for certain traits if the

2808
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:02,698
lines worked a little bit more like

2809
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,380
reading true for purple breeding true

2810
01:46:02,698 --> 01:46:06,118
for the blueberry turfs breeding true

2811
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:07,560
for XYZ

2812
01:46:06,118 --> 01:46:09,539
um oddly enough that's one of those ones

2813
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:11,219
that you can actually get good good true

2814
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:13,198
reading traits a lot like window curbs

2815
01:46:11,219 --> 01:46:15,899
even has a lot of certain traits that

2816
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:17,399
can be true for type and you know maybe

2817
01:46:15,899 --> 01:46:20,279
maybe we can take it back because we

2818
01:46:17,399 --> 01:46:22,198
were talking about nl5as before when um

2819
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:24,960
when Neville was when Neville was

2820
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:27,539
looking through his nl5 hay seeds

2821
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:30,118
he was basically looking for a few

2822
01:46:27,539 --> 01:46:31,800
traits in that he that he was that he

2823
01:46:30,118 --> 01:46:34,319
was after he was looking for something

2824
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:36,119
that was 16 weeks or less

2825
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:38,099
because he thought longer than that was

2826
01:46:36,118 --> 01:46:40,019
a huge pain in the ass so any even if it

2827
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:42,119
was amazing weed if it took 20 weeks he

2828
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:44,280
[ __ ] canned it he was looking for things

2829
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:46,079
with decent yields and he was looking

2830
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:48,899
for things that had the high

2831
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:51,059
yeah he wasn't looking for looks

2832
01:46:48,899 --> 01:46:52,079
he wasn't necessarily looking for flavor

2833
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:54,900
profile

2834
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:57,179
he was looking for time of finish

2835
01:46:54,899 --> 01:47:00,539
bud structure and effect

2836
01:46:57,179 --> 01:47:02,819
yeah you know Guild was super important

2837
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:04,679
too right yeah yeah yeah time to finish

2838
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:06,059
get bud structure that's kind of what I

2839
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:08,399
meant by budget yeah yeah but structure

2840
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:10,139
yeah you know he was good looking for

2841
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:12,000
things that threw bats and and yielded

2842
01:47:10,139 --> 01:47:14,639
fairly solid compared to like a bunch of

2843
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,198
wispy calyxes and stuff like that and so

2844
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:19,440
he had three things he was basically

2845
01:47:16,198 --> 01:47:21,059
looking for time to finish the high and

2846
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:23,219
you know making it making it yield

2847
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,960
enough that it would bud structure and

2848
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:27,359
yield so it was worth taking it that

2849
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,760
four months yeah so he might have found

2850
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,099
some amazingly phenomenal stuff but he

2851
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,619
was like oh it's 21 weeks screw that

2852
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:36,480
yeah and the more traits you start to

2853
01:47:34,618 --> 01:47:38,039
add to look for those things the harder

2854
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:38,819
it's going to be to find it in a single

2855
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:42,779
plant

2856
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:45,618
yep you know that's why I avoid or I try

2857
01:47:42,779 --> 01:47:47,460
to avoid using uh males that are super

2858
01:47:45,618 --> 01:47:49,500
polyhybrid types with a lot of

2859
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:52,679
Expressions to to narrow what I'm doing

2860
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:54,179
so if I have projects I can use it as a

2861
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:55,679
tool as opposed to wondering what's

2862
01:47:54,179 --> 01:47:57,000
going to happen and somebody who wants

2863
01:47:55,679 --> 01:48:00,000
to talk somebody wants to talk about

2864
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,139
flow yeah I think that's a good idea I

2865
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,500
mean we could talk about flow without

2866
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:06,900
doing all the blueberry top sure

2867
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:08,639
um I'll talk about flow and then Matt

2868
01:48:06,899 --> 01:48:10,439
can talk about flow because I probably

2869
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:13,260
have our own different takes on Flow

2870
01:48:10,439 --> 01:48:15,178
yeah blow interested me

2871
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:16,320
because it was incredibly beautiful

2872
01:48:15,179 --> 01:48:20,219
looking

2873
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:23,279
and DJ whack waxed poetic about how it

2874
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:26,039
was almost a pure sativa but it was done

2875
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:29,039
in that seven weeks yeah who doesn't

2876
01:48:26,039 --> 01:48:32,340
want amazing cannabis that's done in 49

2877
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:33,960
or 50 days right yeah um so it had the

2878
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:36,179
had the look it's supposed to have a

2879
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:38,219
very up energetic High

2880
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:40,319
all that type of stuff

2881
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:42,658
um and when we did the I was at the like

2882
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:45,359
I mentioned before I helped Jason King

2883
01:48:42,658 --> 01:48:47,099
in one of the Cana Bible books uh get a

2884
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:48,839
lot of people so he could get a lot of

2885
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:51,239
pictures and and helped with a bunch of

2886
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:54,539
the print projects and stuff and so at

2887
01:48:51,238 --> 01:48:56,218
the cannon Bible party I bought like 450

2888
01:48:54,539 --> 01:48:57,779
seeds or something like that direct from

2889
01:48:56,219 --> 01:49:00,480
DJ

2890
01:48:57,779 --> 01:49:01,979
um probably o3ish or two-ish uh yeah and

2891
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:03,959
one of them was flow so I got about 100

2892
01:49:01,979 --> 01:49:05,638
flow seats

2893
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,480
um and I grew so I grew out a lot of

2894
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:08,460
flow

2895
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,039
I was pretty disappointed there was

2896
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:13,380
especially pre-cookie I got a lot of

2897
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:17,760
Pinks a lot of Blues a lot of purples

2898
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:20,340
lavenders very pretty very feathery not

2899
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,440
a lot of flavor not a lot of high

2900
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:24,000
I was kind of disappointed so that's my

2901
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:26,219
experience with flow

2902
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
yeah I could I can understand some of

2903
01:49:26,219 --> 01:49:28,980
that

2904
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,020
um I fell in love with Flo because you

2905
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:33,479
know like uh a lot of other people I was

2906
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:35,280
I was falling in love with purples and

2907
01:49:33,479 --> 01:49:38,059
at the time Flo was one of those base

2908
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:42,000
purples that people use to to inject

2909
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:44,940
beautiful colors into their work I've

2910
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,979
thrown flow from DJ's stock modern DJ

2911
01:49:44,939 --> 01:49:49,799
stock something I I purchased from him

2912
01:49:46,979 --> 01:49:52,198
in the past few years I've run stock

2913
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:55,380
from uh alkaline man I believe it was

2914
01:49:52,198 --> 01:49:56,759
who did the um the rose float which is

2915
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:59,460
some of the stuff I added to the site

2916
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:01,679
tonight and that was very different the

2917
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:04,800
Old Dutch Passion release of flow is

2918
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:06,600
very different from the modern DJ flow I

2919
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,199
found and

2920
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,060
um

2921
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:11,399
yeah I mean it's a beautiful plant it

2922
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:13,800
can breed breed true for a lot of traits

2923
01:50:11,399 --> 01:50:15,899
it's very floral perfumey smelling from

2924
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:19,260
what my experience is with it but the

2925
01:50:15,899 --> 01:50:21,420
the rose flow from um blind man was like

2926
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:23,280
Rosie perfumey but way more heavy on the

2927
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:26,340
NOG chompa incense which you can also

2928
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:28,019
find in modern flow too stuff like that

2929
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:30,239
um some flow is very cushy looking

2930
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:32,580
almost with the the nuggetry structure

2931
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:34,799
but with those big you know the the

2932
01:50:32,579 --> 01:50:38,460
widespan What DJ called a stretch Indica

2933
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:40,139
you know this long node spacing

2934
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:42,420
um it's a gorgeous plant but it really

2935
01:50:40,139 --> 01:50:44,219
I've never really met anyone goes [ __ ] I

2936
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,239
love smoke and flow I've never met

2937
01:50:44,219 --> 01:50:47,760
anyone

2938
01:50:45,238 --> 01:50:50,399
love just smoking Pure Flow I've never

2939
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,800
met anyone for me I wasn't a fan of the

2940
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:55,138
Colorado flow at all I thought I do not

2941
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:58,380
like that turp said It reminds me of

2942
01:50:55,139 --> 01:51:00,000
like a a much more pronounced turned up

2943
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:01,560
Mach One

2944
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,579
um so I'm not a big fan of that dirt

2945
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:07,199
profile yeah it's that Floral perfumey

2946
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:09,658
but it's very beautiful the Colorado

2947
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:11,759
flow is super beautiful one of the

2948
01:51:09,658 --> 01:51:13,319
prettiest flow Cuts uh Greenworks was

2949
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,539
talking about DJ's flow cut that's

2950
01:51:13,319 --> 01:51:17,399
another really pretty nice one

2951
01:51:15,539 --> 01:51:19,979
um but yeah I I have a lot of experience

2952
01:51:17,399 --> 01:51:21,479
with the Dutch Passion flow and alkaline

2953
01:51:19,979 --> 01:51:24,479
man's work with it and that's what we

2954
01:51:21,479 --> 01:51:26,698
put in the um what do we call it Red

2955
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,259
Menace that crossed above it because

2956
01:51:26,698 --> 01:51:30,419
bubble wood

2957
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:33,000
I kind of wanted to make another I I've

2958
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:34,739
crossed an organ purple tie to Bubba and

2959
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,479
I've now across the float above it to

2960
01:51:34,738 --> 01:51:38,759
see what would a different Afghani type

2961
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,618
that wasn't used in blueberry or in DJ's

2962
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:42,480
work would would you cross to something

2963
01:51:40,618 --> 01:51:43,679
like flow to see what direction it goes

2964
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:45,299
so yeah

2965
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,340
yeah I

2966
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:50,279
um you know I I'm not I'm not trying to

2967
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:52,880
diss DJ sometimes you can find amazing

2968
01:51:50,279 --> 01:51:55,800
stuff in a in in every in a single pack

2969
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:57,420
sometimes you can go through a bunch of

2970
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:00,239
seeds and find nothing that you're

2971
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:02,639
looking for I will say that um you know

2972
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:04,919
when I was uh growing those those lines

2973
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:07,199
especially five six years before cookie

2974
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:09,179
even popped up uh there was a lot of

2975
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,919
colors that were quite rare in cannabis

2976
01:52:09,179 --> 01:52:14,279
back then

2977
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:16,319
um I just never found the Terps and the

2978
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:17,880
high in the same plant

2979
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:19,738
you know if you could have found an

2980
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,800
extremely attractive plant that had nice

2981
01:52:19,738 --> 01:52:25,198
flavor and I the way I wanted it to

2982
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,940
I would have liked that better I just

2983
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:30,138
never was able to find something yeah I

2984
01:52:26,939 --> 01:52:30,138
thought uh

2985
01:52:30,238 --> 01:52:36,359
a lot like a lot like blueberry I think

2986
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:39,000
um Flo does best in hybrids you know

2987
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:41,399
yeah I think that's where it shines I

2988
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,760
think uh I think when when you were

2989
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:46,439
interviewing red and uh Chimera uh

2990
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:49,440
Chimera made a pretty good point which

2991
01:52:46,439 --> 01:52:54,479
is that he sort of considers all of DJ's

2992
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:57,059
work to be one line yeah you know um one

2993
01:52:54,479 --> 01:53:00,419
family and what's nice about it is that

2994
01:52:57,060 --> 01:53:02,820
um it's it's inbred to the point where

2995
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:04,679
um you know it he didn't add a bunch of

2996
01:53:02,819 --> 01:53:07,319
other stuff to it so it sort of is what

2997
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:09,719
it is yeah um and I think DJ took the

2998
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:12,000
breeding perception of oh I see these

2999
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:13,859
phenos in it well now if I take these

3000
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,380
phenos and I breed them together I have

3001
01:53:13,859 --> 01:53:17,939
flow and if I take these phenos and I

3002
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:19,500
breed them I get this and if I take

3003
01:53:17,939 --> 01:53:21,259
these phenos and I breathe them they get

3004
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:24,238
that but they're all from the same

3005
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:26,699
General stock just taken in different

3006
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:29,039
directions and so sometimes that works

3007
01:53:26,698 --> 01:53:31,919
better than others you know

3008
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:33,539
um but it seems like DJ's work is much

3009
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:35,579
better suited to outcrossing to

3010
01:53:33,539 --> 01:53:39,658
something very different than itself

3011
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:42,600
then within itself yeah it seems like it

3012
01:53:39,658 --> 01:53:44,638
shines more in hybrids than it does as a

3013
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:46,260
as far as my personal preference I'm not

3014
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:47,940
gonna like maybe like his son's gonna go

3015
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:49,500
JD's gonna get all [ __ ] mad at me and

3016
01:53:47,939 --> 01:53:50,939
[ __ ] scream around his daughters his

3017
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:53,100
daughter gets real mad all the time you

3018
01:53:50,939 --> 01:53:55,019
know but uh whatever the case may be

3019
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:56,820
so I had a good question for you would

3020
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:58,800
you mind saying if more of the cuts you

3021
01:53:56,819 --> 01:54:00,599
keep are from someone else gifting or

3022
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,659
you hunting seeds that's a good question

3023
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:04,920
most of them are are our Cuts I've

3024
01:54:03,658 --> 01:54:07,500
acquired

3025
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:09,600
you know my collection is pretty weird

3026
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:12,960
in the sense that it's basically

3027
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:14,280
entirely suited around my tastes

3028
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,618
um I didn't collect it for any other

3029
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:18,300
reason that I liked the weed

3030
01:54:16,618 --> 01:54:20,219
um it's only now because most people

3031
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:22,679
didn't collect cuts and didn't hold on

3032
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:24,359
to cuts and there's been a Resurgence

3033
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:26,699
and a desire for some of these old

3034
01:54:24,359 --> 01:54:29,339
famous things that all of a sudden these

3035
01:54:26,698 --> 01:54:31,079
things have been sought after so there's

3036
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:32,760
certain things that I have a lot of

3037
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:34,679
depth in in my collection and there's

3038
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:36,420
other things that I don't prefer that

3039
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:37,859
much that I don't have very much of at

3040
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:39,899
all

3041
01:54:37,859 --> 01:54:42,059
um because it wasn't collected to have

3042
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:43,920
some kind of like comprehensive database

3043
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:45,960
of all weed

3044
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:49,920
it was personal

3045
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:51,480
what's a what's a a sense profile that

3046
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:54,079
you would like to see in cannabis that

3047
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:54,079
you have not yet

3048
01:54:56,279 --> 01:54:59,779
you know

3049
01:54:57,719 --> 01:54:59,779
um

3050
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:05,760
maybe maybe I'll cheat

3051
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:10,319
yeah cheat uh there is a scent profile

3052
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:12,179
in cannabis that um uh I like a lot and

3053
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:14,719
I have not and I would love to see a

3054
01:55:12,179 --> 01:55:18,960
plant that translated it into flavor

3055
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:20,819
I would love a real bubble gum

3056
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,920
I think the bubble gum that's out there

3057
01:55:20,819 --> 01:55:26,579
I there are plants that I think smell

3058
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:30,118
very strongly of bubble gum yeah I don't

3059
01:55:26,579 --> 01:55:32,819
recall smoking things that make me lip

3060
01:55:30,118 --> 01:55:35,279
smack like I just I had some Big League

3061
01:55:32,819 --> 01:55:36,840
Chew yeah you know or something along

3062
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:38,340
those lines I mean there's there's some

3063
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:40,980
aspects of I've you know there's some

3064
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:42,600
maybe some juicy fruit bubble gum maybe

3065
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:44,819
there's some like there's some flavorful

3066
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:48,719
profiles a little bit like that but your

3067
01:55:44,819 --> 01:55:51,420
straight classic pink bubble gum flavor

3068
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:54,719
um I don't get that yeah I got that from

3069
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:56,880
the um the 95 Century starfino that was

3070
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:58,679
bubble gum because it was super Panic oh

3071
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:00,118
yeah bubble gum and it would come

3072
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:01,739
through super like you know what your

3073
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:03,960
paneling does just [ __ ] amplifies

3074
01:56:01,738 --> 01:56:06,599
everything it was it was really nice I

3075
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:08,579
think that's what uh the Indiana bubble

3076
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:10,679
gum needed so I I did grab a bunch of

3077
01:56:08,579 --> 01:56:12,300
the Durban bubble gum from Caleb for

3078
01:56:10,679 --> 01:56:14,520
that reason

3079
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:17,600
um if there's questions going on Matt

3080
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:22,560
won't let me answer how many moms I have

3081
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:25,560
uh for uh opposite offices I'll say you

3082
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:28,199
you guys there are limited to plant

3083
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:30,119
counts why the [ __ ] would you want him

3084
01:56:28,198 --> 01:56:32,879
documenting anything about plant couch

3085
01:56:30,118 --> 01:56:36,179
stop it but I will but but I will say

3086
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:38,400
that when it comes to important Cuts I

3087
01:56:36,179 --> 01:56:41,460
don't like having only one mom of

3088
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:43,439
certain things and and the most

3089
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:45,359
important things to me not only do I not

3090
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:48,799
like having one mom but I do like having

3091
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:48,799
them backed up with friends

3092
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,679
um oh God people want a [ __ ] rare

3093
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,779
dankness I don't want to talk about

3094
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:56,819
right this really obviously he wants us

3095
01:56:54,779 --> 01:56:59,279
to talk Scott you know reach was

3096
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:02,460
involved in early clone trading

3097
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:03,658
um he's been around forever uh he has a

3098
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:05,399
lot of respect from a lot of different

3099
01:57:03,658 --> 01:57:06,839
people so I'm sure he's a great guy I

3100
01:57:05,399 --> 01:57:08,279
don't interact with him so I don't know

3101
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:09,420
I didn't really grow anywhere dating

3102
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:11,219
this stuff at the time because I was

3103
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:12,840
making stuff similar

3104
01:57:11,219 --> 01:57:14,939
um I heard people love that flow OG

3105
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:16,560
cross I heard people I don't know who

3106
01:57:14,939 --> 01:57:18,359
made it for them if that was something

3107
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,340
Scott from Erin Agnes made or something

3108
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:22,019
Fletcher made from archive I know

3109
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:24,420
there's some head butting that went on

3110
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:26,219
there so I don't want to speculate but

3111
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:28,980
yeah

3112
01:57:26,219 --> 01:57:31,260
yeah and so there's there's an aspect of

3113
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:32,879
I will say that

3114
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:35,340
um most of the reason why people don't

3115
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:37,800
keep moms more than what they're

3116
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:39,480
currently growing for for you know

3117
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:41,279
modern times

3118
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:42,718
is because it's expensive it's time

3119
01:57:41,279 --> 01:57:43,859
consuming and it's a huge pain in the

3120
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:46,319
ass

3121
01:57:43,859 --> 01:57:49,439
yeah you know I wish more people did it

3122
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:52,019
but um uh we could have an episode on

3123
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:54,000
long-term mom Health

3124
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:55,560
um and you know I know we mentioned it

3125
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,939
at the beginning of the thing people

3126
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:58,920
have been bugging about it all thing

3127
01:57:56,939 --> 01:58:00,118
it's too late now

3128
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,920
um we are going to run a little over

3129
01:58:00,118 --> 01:58:04,259
than we normally do because people have

3130
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:07,319
been chatting a bunch but I'm not going

3131
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:10,320
to talk about dry Tech today simply

3132
01:58:07,319 --> 01:58:12,719
because it's too deep it's too detailed

3133
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:14,219
of a topic you can do that for one of

3134
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,899
your solo things that I've been trying

3135
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:17,399
to get you to record forever so there's

3136
01:58:15,899 --> 01:58:19,019
an aspect actually where there is a

3137
01:58:17,399 --> 01:58:20,579
bunch of solo content about some

3138
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:21,840
historical stuff that's about to come

3139
01:58:20,579 --> 01:58:24,179
out

3140
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,880
um I know I promised it and uh it's

3141
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:28,739
right in the middle of my growing season

3142
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,359
um so of course like it's it's awesome

3143
01:58:28,738 --> 01:58:31,738
for me to like be like oh I'll come out

3144
01:58:30,359 --> 01:58:33,359
with all this new stuff right in the

3145
01:58:31,738 --> 01:58:35,158
middle of like I got plants everywhere

3146
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:38,819
so

3147
01:58:35,158 --> 01:58:41,039
um but uh there will be some historical

3148
01:58:38,819 --> 01:58:43,799
stuff coming out and what we're going to

3149
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:45,840
do with it is I am going to talk for

3150
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,539
five or ten minutes about some specific

3151
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:50,520
histories or specific strains and it's

3152
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:53,639
very likely that I'm also going to make

3153
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:55,679
like an IG post with possibly some

3154
01:58:53,639 --> 01:58:58,020
pictures and some more information and a

3155
01:58:55,679 --> 01:59:01,440
brief description and then people can go

3156
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:04,260
on our our our podcast and see like a

3157
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:07,500
little short and and listen it'll

3158
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:10,139
probably be mostly uh uh audio

3159
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:13,380

um it will you know we're going to do

3162
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:18,239

3163
01:59:16,618 --> 01:59:20,698

3200
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:41,580
held close for a long time and he's been

3201
02:00:39,118 --> 02:00:42,899
breeding in my opinion which is one of

3202
02:00:41,579 --> 02:00:45,300
the best ways to breed which is with

3203
02:00:42,899 --> 02:00:48,000
stuff he likes a lot

3204
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:49,739
