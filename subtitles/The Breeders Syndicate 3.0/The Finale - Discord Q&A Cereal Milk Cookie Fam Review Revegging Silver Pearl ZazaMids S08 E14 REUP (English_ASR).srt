maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,479
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,460
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,379

The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,140
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,218
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,219
this is the revolution

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,660
hey everyone welcome to reader Syndicate

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,859
welcome to the season finale of season

28
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,079
eight

29
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,819
um today me and thousand thousand will

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,099
be joining us we're going to be going

31
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,219
through users questions and kind of have

32
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:14,059
a relaxed Kickback episode to end the

33
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:17,219
season for a real kind of serious

34
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,000
breeding topic so yeah

35
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,400
um

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,519
let's kick it off

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,618
yeah sure okay so this is one we got

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,840
from Buckshot Hill actually a while ago

39
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,659
but we couldn't get to it and um we'll

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,520
see how we do okay so Buckshot wants to

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,799
know he says I've been talking with not

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,539
so about the early Pearl and how best to

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,299
proceed with my goals for finding a long

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,880
lost female or doing a 2.0 remake with

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,439
starting material that's period correct

46
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,780
the topic has been brought up to The

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,539
Syndicate before and it's been discussed

48
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,978
uh or maybe speculated that nl1 might be

49
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,040
the unknown indica

50
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,599
never used to make early Pearl improved

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,820
I've been planning across with silver

52
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,280
Pearl to bring the DNA of 90s early

53
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,679
pullback into the mix not so agree that

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,000
is a good direction for a starting point

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,799
I've also been looking into what pure

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,098
Indica would have been available to

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,479
Neville in 89.90 and big bud fits the

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,699
possibilities

59
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,160
I started perfect proceeds from pip and

60
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,919
lost Pearl from Greenhouse both silver

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,500
Pearl s1s

62
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,119
um what do you think uh you know does it

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,139
sound appropriate

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
um

65
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,399
yeah so this is an interesting one

66
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,799
because this is a mixture of provenance

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,659
and what we know of

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
these lines

69
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,139
um as well as a breeding question so

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,939
yeah

71
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:40,079
so what do you think

72
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,939
early Pearl is an early early line

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,519
um brought to the community by Rob Clark

74
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,900
I'm not sure who like the base is for it

75
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,980
I should say were brought to you by Rob

76
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,019
Clark I'm not sure who's actually

77
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,959
responsible for it

78
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:55,200
um later on uh early Pearl worked its

79
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,300
way to Holland uh and into Neville

80
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,060
schoenmaker's hands

81
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,379
um according to his one of his last

82
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,060
Partners

83
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:05,399
um early Pearl ended up being one of his

84
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,378
favorite strains ever and he was

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,420
constantly working to trying to find the

86
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,039
sweetness that was in the Mexican in

87
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,658
early Pearl because he felt like the

88
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,359
sweetness that was coming through in the

89
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,639
early Pearl was from the Mexican or

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,400
oaxacan type side

91
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,619
um so yeah that's that's the idea that

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,658
he was going for behind early Pearl was

93
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,819
the sweetness in that Mexican and he

94
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,199
liked the high a lot and I I agree I

95
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:29,579
like the high from the pearls quite a

96
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,780
bit

97
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,940
um

98
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,019
if I were gonna do an early Pearl

99
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,180
Project

100
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,860
like I think that's a great place to

101
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,200
start and mostly because I love silver

102
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,440
Pearl so much like

103
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:47,280
I don't know though I don't remember how

104
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,560
much different like the s1s like from

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,719
Greenhouse are going to be from like say

106
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,699
I had one early Pearl clone that went

107
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,680
around San Diego

108
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,939
yeah

109
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,739
you know like there's a bunch of

110
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,079
different ones and I don't know how

111
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,060
similar they all were to each other and

112
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,980
I don't know how similar silver Pearl

113
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,400
was to like the early broke one I saw

114
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,798
you know what I mean yeah um yeah but if

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,260
if you want a basis for provenance like

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,299
that that perfect Pearl from killer

117
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,659
killer some of the best silver Pearl

118
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,220
work that there is with silver Pearl

119
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,860
though there's definitely some skunk one

120
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,360
in it in the in the smells but

121
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,180
it's it's

122
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,520
a world of other scents too so it's one

123
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,860
of the few skunk one lines that really

124
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,139
doesn't get too muddled down with skunk

125
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,979
one you know and silver Pearl

126
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,500
um

127
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:38,639
yeah I those lines would be perfect I

128
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
don't know anything about like I said I

129
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,340
don't know anything about the greenhouse

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,280
line and they're not very consistent and

131
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,959
they kind of um I mean they're not for

132
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,099
their bait and switching in the first

133
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,299
place so

134
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,400
you know you never know what you're

135
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,280
gonna get there uh but with Fifth Line

136
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,379
I've seen it run it used it read with it

137
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,879
it's amazing so I think that's an

138
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,519
amazing thing to start with

139
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:04,560
um as far as the unknown Indica I think

140
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:06,478
the big uh uh definitely a viable option

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,100
um there's not a lot of reading that

142
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,860
Neville did where he didn't disclose

143
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,020
what he was using and I tend to have the

144
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,939
sneaking suspicion and it's just like

145
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,680
from knowing Neville and talking to him

146
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,839
and you know

147
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,519
messing with them that I think you know

148
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,679
usually when I see things like unknown

149
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,939
Indica being referenced by Neville it

150
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,319
immediately makes me think oh he's

151
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:26,579
probably using Afghani one or something

152
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,579
from Sam

153
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,339
because he hated Sam this company so

154
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,500
much that like if there was anything

155
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,119
used to name his work yeah if there's

156
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,720
anyone who would strip

157
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,100
from it would totally be Sam you know so

158
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,020
um yeah all he ever did was don't talk

159
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,180
Afghani one but I swear to God he used

160
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,159
it a lot of stuff so

161
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,319
um and and named it other things called

162
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,060
it other things you know so that's just

163
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,819
a theory I know some of the other

164
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,439
partners share that theory with me too

165
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,959
separately yeah because Buckshot

166
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,500
mentioned that his guess was big bud but

167
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,120
I imagine that if it had been there's no

168
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,959
reason for it to not have been named

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,720
right yeah yeah especially at that point

170
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,060
yeah fascinating

171
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,560
I guess

172
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,478
I mean I had a thought here which is

173
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,319
also uh and because he doesn't mention

174
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:23,339
it with a buckshot himself has

175
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,659
um a sense of the Pearl that he wants to

176
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,159
capture

177
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,500
um or whether this is kind of like an

178
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,939
abstract almost like academic thing and

179
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,879
he doesn't actually have that experience

180
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,939
I think um his family had a early early

181
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,800
Pearl cut or seed line but they like

182
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,240
cherished so that's why they're going

183
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,819
back to 100 so I think they have a lot

184
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,620
of experience with the pearls so that'll

185
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,939
be a tremendous help you know obviously

186
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,620
like if you have a ton of experience

187
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,060
with early Pearl and you're running

188
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,800
through a bunch of silver Pearl crosses

189
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,780
that's going to be

190
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,660
tons of help you know to select away

191
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:56,638
from the skunk one and everything else

192
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,259
cool all right

193
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,478
well Buckshot I guess you got to keep us

194
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:04,699
updated on how this goes yes please do

195
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,699
shout out to Buck and his wife

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
yeah I hope you're doing well buddy

197
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,239
okay

198
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,579
um

199
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,978
so this is a a bit of a broader question

200
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,139
Matt and this one has more to do with

201
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,360
the industry and maybe

202
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,400
ethics and philosophy a little bit as

203
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,400
well but Australia so

204
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,739
this is from squirrel okay and he asks

205
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:28,918
what's the difference between the

206
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,800
breeder a seed maker and a seed company

207
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,959
he also wants to talk uh he also wants

208
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,199
to ask you about ghost breeding

209
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,198
um yeah

210
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,340
and uh there's more to the question that

211
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,199
concerns uh Josie and subcool but maybe

212
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,119
I don't know do you want to like include

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,560
that no kind of just address his first

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,399
question yeah we'll do the first one

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,978
first

216
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,579
yeah okay so this is something like I've

217
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:55,800
spent a lot of my career trying to

218
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,300
not necessarily educate people on but

219
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
try to help Define this for the

220
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,379
community

221
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,019
and and make it very clear that there

222
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,939
are different categories

223
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,818
um so that when people are shopping they

224
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,160
understand who they're buying from what

225
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,660
they're buying and all of that and

226
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,780
that's the difference between a breeder

227
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,660
a seed maker what's the last one

228
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,939
they said Seed Company

229
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,979
I guess maybe that could mean like a

230
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,800
potentially like a seed bank maybe yeah

231
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:29,300
okay so yeah let's do breeder let's do

232
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,060
breeder Seed Company seed bank

233
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,440
seed maker Seed Company same thing to me

234
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,978
um

235
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,800
so a breeder let's start with a breeder

236
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,560
there is rarely going to be anyone who

237
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,958
can actually call themselves a breeder

238
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,639
in cannabis even though our show is

239
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,979
called the breeder syndicate

240
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,080
like realistically looking at

241
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,360
agricultural breeding I can't call

242
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,060
myself like a real breeder I don't sit

243
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,278
there and work a line for 25 years bring

244
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,679
it to Market you know like hunt Sports

245
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:05,639
in a line like all that stuff to me

246
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:10,338
that's very much breeding breeding

247
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:14,100
um in cannabis though we kind of

248
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:16,620
considering what we've had you know and

249
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,879
and who's led the way and and how

250
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,159
they've done it

251
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,679
bring has been a lot different from our

252
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,019
cultural perspective right it's so much

253
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,819
different than AG so the breeders in our

254
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,399
community tend to be what we consider

255
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,160
the people who have worked many lines

256
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,940
multiple Generations you know they start

257
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,759
with a goal they look at their Tools in

258
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,680
their toolbox be it clones or seed lines

259
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,039
and they say what can help me get to

260
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,139
this goal and then they you know they

261
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,278
use those tools and work until they meet

262
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,539
that goal it could be several

263
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,759
Generations in or it could be one

264
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:53,219
generation but that's that's breeding

265
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,139
breeding is just goal-oriented selection

266
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,459
to me

267
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,379
um

268
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,619
then there's seed making

269
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,539
and anybody can make seats

270
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,000
like that's not

271
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,860
that's not a secret like anybody can

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,019
make seeds and anybody can make seeds

273
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,320
that turn out decent

274
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,299
anybody can make seeds that turn out

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,700
insanely fire

276
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,899
um but seed making isn't necessarily

277
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,879
breeding

278
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,820
while you are making seeds while

279
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,679
breeding a seed maker is one in our

280
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,540
community the definition would be one

281
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,579
who makes seeds but they're not really

282
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,079
into the selection they're not really

283
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,600
working lines they're doing you know

284
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,440
one-off crosses here they are boom you

285
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,159
know it's and it's a very valid way of

286
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,440
um

287
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,919
selling seeds like most of the market is

288
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,860
this I'd say 99.9 of the market is this

289
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,659
I do a lot of this one-off crosses here

290
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,899
they are if you want to take it further

291
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:54,120
feel free if not you know drop it

292
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,799
um I think it's the most common thing

293
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,500
you're gonna run into in the seed world

294
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,838
is seed makers now you can have seed

295
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,000
makers that do breeding projects I would

296
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,399
say that I've done that

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,860
um but I've done more seed making

298
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,958
projects than breeding projects and I

299
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,399
think that's the majority of our

300
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,379
community

301
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,259
and then you have something like a seed

302
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:19,320
bank and a seed bank is somewhere where

303
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:21,000
you can go and get

304
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,399
the idea would be that you can go and

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,620
get a multitude of different options of

306
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,419
lines from a seed bank

307
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,740
um usually a seed bank hosts many

308
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:30,899
breeders

309
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,000
in cannabis in our culture that's how

310
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,278
it's usually gone down but then there

311
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,440
are some breeders like CSI that are so

312
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,679
prolific that you can literally get

313
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,779
almost any cross from them and they

314
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,000
become a seed bank in themselves they're

315
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:46,919
so prolific that's a rare rare

316
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,299
occurrence I mean there's people who

317
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,578
claim that they do that but there's not

318
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,399
really yeah yeah

319
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,139
um that would be the overall rundown on

320
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,799
that off the top of my head like the

321
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:02,338
main differences is goal oriented versus

322
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,199
um just strictly production and uh yeah

323
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,459
I know I didn't go into ghost breeding

324
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,920
yet

325
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,958
yeah I guess that that's like a natural

326
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,259
next yeah

327
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,958
step so I guess this is when um the seed

328
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,419
making itself or breeding I guess is

329
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,039
outsourced to someone else right yeah so

330
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,259
a lot of us have done this I've done it

331
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,299
I um I see no problem with doing this

332
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,799
for people I like to be transparent

333
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:26,578
about it but a lot of people that hire

334
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,379
me

335
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:30,059
don't want me to be transparent about it

336
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,159
and that's fine too because it's their

337
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,599
prerogative how they how they move their

338
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,100
seeds and sell their seeds isn't up to

339
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,259
me I just want to make so just to

340
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,079
clarify Matt you mean that you've um

341
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,759
you've done some ghost seed making slash

342
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,578
breeding for other people yeah for other

343
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,379
seed companies yeah yeah and and made

344
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:49,559
seeds for them they sold it under their

345
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,778
name you know and let them rep that as

346
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,099
their strain and and you don't really go

347
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,179
around telling people that you made it

348
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,399
because

349
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,078
you got paid up front and that's your

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,120
goal is to just do that and their goal

351
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,838
is to be the seed maker

352
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,379
um

353
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,139
it's it was a lot more common

354
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,179
um to see back in the day like things

355
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,980
like that I don't really know what's

356
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,799
going on today most of the ghost

357
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,278
breeding quote unquote ghost breeding is

358
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:19,740
done in Spain or in Colombia and people

359
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,019
are buying their seeds bulk from there

360
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,360
and I I spill I spilled this out in

361
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,278
other episodes but essentially like in

362
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,120
the in the mid 2000s the way it worked

363
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:32,220
was you know like Amsterdam would Source

364
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,379
out people were already making seeds in

365
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,720
Spain and they were making crosses of

366
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:38,700
things like random Northern Lights I

367
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,879
remember that the plant just said NL in

368
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,700
the in the um Buddha seeds room

369
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:49,559
um uh orange bud

370
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,420
uh White Widow AK-47 uh White Russian

371
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,759
White Rhino

372
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,199
blueberry

373
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,819
hash plant

374
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,320
like there's a lot of things like that

375
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,459
just normal generic things that you

376
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,740
would have seen in like scentsy's

377
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:04,078
catalog back in the day is what they say

378
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,659
they have in Spain and they make crosses

379
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,239
of all of these feminized crosses of all

380
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:11,699
of them every single which direction and

381
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,200
then the the Dutch company's given a

382
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,639
catalog and they'll look through it and

383
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,620
they'll say oh this is the closest to

384
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,899
what my Cali missed was or this is the

385
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,839
closest to what uh the White Rhino

386
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,639
hybrid we had was or this isn't even

387
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,019
close to gelato but [ __ ] it it's cheap

388
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,360
let's put it in there people will know

389
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,980
the difference a la Barney's Farm you

390
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
know like uh their people Punch or

391
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,920
whatever you could name any of their

392
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,899
their work

393
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,099
um work

394
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,539
um but yeah that's essentially how it

395
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,379
worked back then and they would go

396
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:39,659
through it they would try to find

397
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,860
something that was similar genetically

398
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,778
similar and that would be good enough

399
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:48,000
and you know 2005 on anybody that bought

400
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,639
anything from Amsterdam from any Dutch

401
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,698
company that's what happened they all

402
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,399
Outsource that's it was done it's a y

403
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:57,838
it's a wrap Spanish is Spain Spain's

404
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,578
making everything everything's now

405
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,160
confused because everything's being

406
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:04,198
relabeled and renamed you know so think

407
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,578
of all the Breeders post 2005 that were

408
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:07,620
using Dutch genetics to make their

409
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:10,259
hybrids

410
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,220
so Matt like from from the point of view

411
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:16,679
of these uh companies with seed banks uh

412
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,899
Outsourcing the stuff or you know kind

413
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,519
of picking from these catalogs the

414
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,440
incentives for them are quite clear it's

415
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,480
obviously going to be cheaper and blah

416
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,639
blah finally

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm curious then this is a tangent for

418
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,480
you when you were doing it what was the

419
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,040
incentive for you or like why would you

420
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,620
have gotten into it

421
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,719
um why does one get into that so when I

422
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,940
got into it it was because I had small

423
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,320
spaces and the places that wanted me to

424
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,940
do these reversals had massive spaces so

425
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,320
even though they were choosing what I

426
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,220
got to work with

427
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,800
like I got to see massive populations of

428
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,320
done in these big reversals that I was

429
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,479
doing so my main motive was that just

430
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,980
getting to see populations grown and

431
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,079
traits and all of that didn't matter

432
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,060
what it was as long as I was getting to

433
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,679
see massive populations because that was

434
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,259
my goal was to see massive populations

435
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,479
and how and what what comes of it you

436
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,698
know yeah um yeah and so there were some

437
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,680
interesting benefits for you yeah and

438
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:15,179
sometimes it would be friends you know

439
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,278
like friends that had seed companies

440
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:19,019
that were down at the time and couldn't

441
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,698
make the seeds so I just be like [ __ ]

442
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,139
I'll glue it out there and do it you

443
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:23,278
know they knew that I'd do it and do it

444
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,500
right and

445
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,379
yeah so if any of you are still hiring

446
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,820
you know I do I do it

447
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:31,019
I don't know how many I don't know how

448
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,480
many seed companies are still in

449
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,980
existence after this uh fallout but yeah

450
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,778
I mean that was a big thing for a long

451
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,820
time uh making Femme seeds for other

452
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:42,778
dudes so they could sell them

453
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,240
yeah yeah and I I think you know uh in a

454
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,980
way when you first when one first hears

455
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,759
about this it might seem

456
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,278
immediately like it's a

457
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,139
scummy or kind of a scammy thing but not

458
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,899
necessarily right like it can it can be

459
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,759
super innocuous like that in that

460
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,100
situation when I do it like I'm using

461
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,360
the real clones to do it so you're

462
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,058
getting the product that you think

463
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,798
you're gonna get it's not like uh

464
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,539
you know like they outsourced it you're

465
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,798
getting calumist white rhino when you

466
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,699
think you're getting wedding cake you

467
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,078
know what I mean like it's you're

468
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,459
actually getting what you're supposed to

469
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,279
be getting the only transparent

470
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,860
transparency that's not there usually is

471
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,298
who made it and most of these guys that

472
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,099
I did this for don't even really

473
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:24,838
communicate with the public to say that

474
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,818
they made it or didn't make it it's just

475
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,139
assumed it's inferred because they're

476
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:31,798
such big companies They Don't Really

477
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,299
interact you know so okay so that's an

478
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,058
important distinction to make as well

479
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,859
that even within this

480
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:41,038
um Endeavor of ghost breeding or

481
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:43,019
Outsourcing seed making that there's

482
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,419
still a difference as it as it as there

483
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,279
is with actual breeding uh between the

484
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,840
people who are using

485
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,399
um the real materials and know what

486
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,418
they're doing versus the people who

487
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,280
don't yeah and there's one other thing I

488
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,960
definitely want to to put out there too

489
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,779
is that like

490
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,579
Spaniards got [ __ ] on a lot because they

491
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,160
were the ones making the seeds that the

492
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,319
Dutch were selling but

493
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,880
the the Spaniards did really good work

494
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,500
like I think they were very confident

495
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,120
the guys who were making the bulk seeds

496
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,919
over there were very competent

497
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,379
um they were some of the first pioneers

498
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,759
doing massive massive Femme reversals

499
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,100
over in Spain so I have a lot of respect

500
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,839
for those dudes a lot and it's just

501
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,399
unfortunate how it played out because

502
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,918
like in Spain it was just a bunch of

503
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,559
dudes with like no ego at all that

504
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,720
wanted to make seeds and that's it they

505
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,038
just wanted to make seeds and they

506
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,079
didn't care about a name they didn't

507
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,940
care about getting famous at all yeah

508
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,139
and yeah

509
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,900
right

510
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,820
the honest was I guess more on the the

511
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,380
people using these seeds and selling

512
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,899
these seeds on and what how they

513
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,400
represented them right absolutely yeah I

514
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,220
mean if there's no transparency it makes

515
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,960
it kind of hard right like you think

516
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,339
that Barn there's a guy named Barnegat

517
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,740
Barney's Farm doing all this killer

518
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,439
breeding right like yeah

519
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,120
yeah

520
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,740
Barney and Berner and there is no Barney

521
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,659
I wonder who Barney is

522
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,058
he doesn't even exist there's a guy

523
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,380
named Gary somewhere

524
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,960
yeah

525
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,020
okay that's cool I think actually those

526
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,460
were a couple of good insights that um

527
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,900
you kind of have talked about these

528
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,880
things before but maybe not in that much

529
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,240
depth so that's cool those were cool

530
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,620
anecdotes yeah um ghost breeding so it's

531
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,660
a tricky thing because like I said yeah

532
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,439
it's political

533
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,900
um

534
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,660
you know and and the weird thing was

535
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,400
that I've got accused of like buying

536
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,400
bulk seeds from Spain and selling them

537
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,900
and I was like for for a company to have

538
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,759
to do that like you have to be a pretty

539
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,940
wealthy company moving a lot of seeds to

540
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,200
make that a viable method for doing it

541
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,940
because you're buying bulk so you're

542
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,759
spending like 20 grand

543
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,340
I don't have 20 grand like to be buying

544
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,960
bulk seeds like you know so it just even

545
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,759
financially and economically it would

546
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,819
never make sense for me to Outsource

547
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:00,000
some not that big you know like

548
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:02,220
yeah like there's no reason to Outsource

549
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,339
um the kilowatt hours in Spain versus

550
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,860
the US was and the land prices in rent

551
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,538
was why a lot of people chose why Spain

552
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,579
ended up being the place to do all this

553
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:13,859
the permissiveness

554
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,538
um because it was wasn't super permitted

555
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,759
but it wasn't super

556
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:20,519
attacked

557
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,339
um by the local police there and the

558
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,379
kilowatt hour and the space is why and

559
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,359
and it's also why Colombia opened up too

560
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,100
and why Colombia is starting to produce

561
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,859
a massive amount of these seeds down

562
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:34,019
there for the Breeders up here the seed

563
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,678
makers like uh the compounds or whatever

564
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,679
of the world

565
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,159
uh another tangent

566
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,720
um and I mentioned to you that just

567
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,140
before we start a recording that I

568
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,940
watched the burn a video about visiting

569
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,520
Thailand to open the cookie stores there

570
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,720
but I also wonder next what Thailand is

571
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,259
going to

572
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,298
you know what kind of platform or um

573
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,220
possibilities Thailand is going to

574
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,200
introduce so I'm going to say something

575
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,058
very very it might hurt a lot of

576
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,740
people's feelings it might be a little

577
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:06,599
spicy

578
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,079
but I saw

579
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:12,719
the worst of California

580
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,879
go to the world go and be the worst in

581
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,798
Colorado and then they went to Michigan

582
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,440
the same people and then they went to

583
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,038
Oklahoma and now they're all in Thailand

584
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,558
like it's just like been this

585
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,240
downward slide of failure and of refuse

586
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,099
all going to Thailand there's good dudes

587
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,819
there too like the good dudes went but

588
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:33,298
like

589
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:35,099
a lot of Bad Dudes went a lot of bad

590
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:37,440
dudes that just ripped people off along

591
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,359
the way in all these states all ended up

592
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,640
there so I'm very interested to see how

593
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,538
that plays out because it's like they

594
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,100
went there because they think it's

595
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:47,038
[ __ ] Lawless and they get away with

596
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,259
some crazy [ __ ] you know but yeah I I

597
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,279
just don't know I don't know I don't

598
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:51,538
know if they know what they're in for

599
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,940
either

600
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:56,579
maybe uh either later in the year or

601
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,460
even 2024 we can try and Wrangle a

602
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,839
Thailand update from someone everybody

603
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,419
there I have everybody there right now

604
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,500
yeah that would be that would be really

605
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,299
interesting

606
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,339
um

607
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:10,440
to watch his journey it's rough dude

608
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,480
like when he first got over there

609
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,740
um I'm talking about HBK uh we

610
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,259
interviewed him right before he moved

611
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,259
and um just watching his journey on

612
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:22,558
Facebook just like even adapting to the

613
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:24,839
food and water was brutal to watch him

614
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,759
he just got so [ __ ] up by that place

615
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,158
you know like there's so many things

616
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,079
that I wouldn't even think about when

617
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,620
thinking about moving to Thailand to

618
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,298
grow like just basic food survival stuff

619
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:39,500
that our American stomachs can't take

620
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:39,500
you know things like that

621
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,099
yeah okay well I I think this could be

622
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:47,340
an interesting episode so maybe imagine

623
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:49,859
I can discuss this later yeah

624
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:51,839
okay well coming back to school's

625
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,759
question and I uh was there anything

626
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,079
else you wanted to say on ghost breeding

627
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,379
Matt before we moved on to the second

628
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,379
part

629
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,380
just that it's more prolific than than

630
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,720
most people know like

631
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,340
you know like it's it's hard to not name

632
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,779
names

633
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,339
because

634
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,480
people really think these people make

635
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,480
their seeds but like

636
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,840
the biggest sellers the people who make

637
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,538
the most money in seeds the compounds

638
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,379
the seed Junkies you know name a few

639
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:21,419
names

640
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,799
they don't make their seeds they're not

641
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,480
breeders

642
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,038
they have other people make them at

643
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,259
these facilities that are [ __ ] trash

644
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,119
you know like and they don't give a [ __ ]

645
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:33,900
who's making the seeds they just need

646
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,399
seed to put in a in a shell to sell as

647
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,960
long as there's a physical seed there

648
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,460
they're good because they don't give a

649
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,900
[ __ ] what happens to it afterwards as

650
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,740
everybody saw it with the Candy Rain

651
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,720
cookies you know like yeah nobody cares

652
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,159
but yeah that's it is the majority of

653
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,960
what people have in their collections

654
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,720
was made

655
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,179
ghost bread it was Ghost bread or made

656
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,798
in Spain or Colombia and they just have

657
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,259
no clue

658
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:01,259
yeah and so I guess like like you were

659
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,798
implying earlier ghost breeding in and

660
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,960
of itself isn't a good or bad thing

661
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,058
um it's a context and in some contexts

662
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,058
it's perfectly innocuous in another

663
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:14,279
context it's perfectly insidious

664
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:16,440
insidious it's as Insidious as you can

665
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:19,619
imagine in some contexts but um yeah

666
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,940
yeah it's um it's very mild it's just a

667
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,500
matter of well

668
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,720
you know at least you get what you got

669
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,038
yeah

670
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,440
it seeds it's almost the best you can

671
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:29,940
hope for anyone it's sad oh well at

672
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,220
least you got what you [ __ ] paid for

673
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,120
I mean maybe you know maybe it wasn't a

674
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,279
dude

675
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,658
his face was on that picture smiling at

676
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,700
you but at least you got what you paid

677
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,860
for and that's like that's sad that's

678
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,960
the best we can hope for really like

679
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,699
like it's hard to hope for a breeder who

680
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,079
will like write you back and be like

681
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,519
okay well if you're interested in this

682
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,139
line you know like here's some traits

683
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,400
and blah blah blah that that doesn't

684
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,720
happen I hear about it all the time

685
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,580
people email me and I'm like dude I'm

686
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,558
surprised you even responded I've never

687
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:58,079
had anybody respond before

688
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:59,158
you know yeah but it's because people

689
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,079
don't understand it's not because

690
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,280
they're busy people just don't know how

691
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,538
to answer the questions they don't have

692
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:05,879
answers to the questions that you're

693
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:09,179
asking it's about bringing stuff

694
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,860
and that's a reality like it sucks to

695
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,780
say and people are probably gonna get

696
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,699
pissed that I said it but it's a reality

697
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,639
it really is

698
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,319
yeah so it's a great question because

699
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,020
it uh

700
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:24,058
it sums up quite a bit uh it does the

701
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:27,960
industry I think it's one of the most

702
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:30,298
important topics to to probably recover

703
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,120
every now and then just because there's

704
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:35,879
so many new people coming in that don't

705
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,759
know that big massive part and when it

706
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,980
was going on during the mid-2000s I was

707
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,778
jumping up screaming stomping my feet

708
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,038
[ __ ] screaming it from the rafters

709
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:46,380
and that's when I was getting banned

710
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:48,538
from every Forum back then

711
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,240
it wasn't something that everybody knew

712
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:53,460
it was never it was never an Open Secret

713
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,140
back then even like it just wasn't

714
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,640
talked about you weren't allowed to talk

715
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,000
about it like

716
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
you know it's just yeah

717
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,099
Maybe

718
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,900
every year or every six months they're

719
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,939
they're certain certain topics that are

720
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,460
worth revisiting maybe like I think

721
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,798
that's a good good call

722
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,480
we can okay it's finally I just off the

723
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,619
top of my head right it would be fun to

724
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,519
like

725
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:22,859
uh get a Euro your Europe update be fun

726
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,139
to get a Thailand update it'll be fun

727
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:27,839
for you to do a reflection on the uh

728
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,120
American industry you know what I really

729
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,379
want to do too is a prediction episode

730
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,778
each year

731
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,700
predicting what's going to happen as

732
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:37,380
well what companies will do what what

733
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,000
companies will still be around and yeah

734
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,000
I think that'll be fun

735
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,380
yeah a little spicy

736
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,240
okay okay let's so

737
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,520
squirrel's second question which is

738
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,620
related also has to do with some of the

739
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,259
politics politics and complexities of

740
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,099
you know running these companies sure

741
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,440
um

742
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:01,918
and he wants to know about

743
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:06,659
the legacy of breeders or seed makers

744
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,120
who have died and some of the messes or

745
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,940
complications around that like do you

746
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,839
have any

747
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,820
yeah so

748
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,220
I think like the main one that most

749
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,079
people think of when it comes to messes

750
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,120
after people pass would probably be

751
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,980
Gorilla Glue

752
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,859
um

753
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,419
Josie Josie and Loan

754
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:29,339
I don't use a real name everybody knows

755
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,480
their names but I'm Josie and Loan

756
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,000
um are the people responsible for

757
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,298
Gorilla Glue and

758
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,400
near the end they had tried to do a

759
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:40,558
legal company and there was a lot of

760
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,140
like cease and desists sent out saying

761
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,519
you can't use Gorilla Glue for clone

762
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,500
which is a clone that was passed to

763
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,000
everyone and anybody that was using it

764
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,038
they were saying cease and desist too

765
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,179
they didn't do it to me because we were

766
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,619
friends

767
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,360
um but it wasn't even necessarily Josie

768
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,639
and lone that were doing it they they

769
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,139
had hired some legal stuff and you know

770
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,720
they had a friend named Kat who's super

771
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,059
nice I got along with cat real well

772
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,740
um nice person and she ended up being

773
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,759
who had Gorilla Glue after they both

774
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,519
passed

775
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,099
and um yeah it was just wild it was

776
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,379
different it was political I know

777
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,339
um I sat on my gorilla glue for hybrids

778
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,520
because me and Josie were gonna release

779
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:18,839
it as a collab and then after we passed

780
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,519
there was some lawsuits going on with

781
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:22,259
the company I'm like [ __ ] this I'm not

782
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,079
dealing with this [ __ ] you know I don't

783
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:27,960
get wrapped up in some lawsuit so uh I

784
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:31,740
just sat on him forever you know um

785
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,900
I know CSI like I I won't even

786
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,339
he he released Gorilla Glue in

787
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,659
collaboration with Josie and made sure

788
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,339
that his family's still getting money

789
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,960
for it too which I think is so

790
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,639
commendable there's all different ways

791
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,419
it's done

792
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,940
um

793
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,919
and it's just you know it really depends

794
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,538
up to the person how they handle it but

795
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,038
it's it's also that how the community

796
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:51,119
reacts

797
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:52,379
I think

798
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,619
um

799
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,080
that is to say like

800
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:00,119
you can't really ask these breeders that

801
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,699
are passed away you know like if you can

802
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,639
use their work right and like a lot of

803
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,460
times you know Suns pop up like we saw

804
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,100
with uh bog he actually had a real son

805
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,140
and then we had fake Sons pop up after

806
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:15,058
they died pretending to sell his gear

807
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,259
this has happened so many times after

808
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,538
people pass

809
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:20,640
happened with zochi when he passed

810
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,259
someone was claiming to be him selling

811
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,179
his seeds goat monkey

812
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,220
it's horrible it's one of the most

813
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,500
disgusting horrible things I've seen and

814
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,058
it's more a recent Trend when people die

815
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,579
for someone to pop up pretend to be

816
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:34,200
their son and sell their seeds

817
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:37,918
um but yeah it's been happening a lot

818
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,419
that's that's one weird segment of this

819
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,080
uh question

820
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,960
as far as like for me

821
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,220
uh using lone star's blue bonnet and

822
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,380
specifically because me and Lone Star

823
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,759
weren't tight we weren't enemies by any

824
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,620
stress to imagine we never argued or

825
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,720
anything but um

826
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:57,000
we weren't tight like we weren't friends

827
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,140
and I wasn't close with his friends that

828
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,079
are still around

829
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,059
so approaching the blue Bond stuff was

830
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,639
kind of weird for me and it still is to

831
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:07,200
this day because like I want to make

832
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,520
sure that he gets as much respect as

833
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,980
possible because it was beautiful work

834
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,019
that made all of the blueberry stuff

835
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,460
that I do that is so super blueberry he

836
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,099
did all of the work that made all that

837
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,659
possible and you know like when when I'm

838
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:19,980
looking at my posts people want to give

839
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,260
me credit and the whole time I'm like

840
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,759
but I didn't really do much you know but

841
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:25,079
people want to give me credit and I

842
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,720
don't know how his friends feel about

843
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,158
that because I don't want to so you take

844
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,899
credit for it but it keeps getting put

845
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,620
on me you know what I mean like

846
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:36,719
there it's complex it is so complex but

847
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:39,898
in the end like I just try to think

848
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,700
about it from my own perspective like if

849
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,259
I'm gone and the stuff that I had

850
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,419
anything to do with is still passing on

851
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,398
and people are still saying my name then

852
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,860
that's Magic

853
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,119
that's the only way you still live right

854
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:52,519
yeah

855
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,839
yep

856
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,359
I look at it but some of the people may

857
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,759
look at it different you know um

858
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,199
yeah people Sue each other over this

859
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,558
[ __ ] so

860
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,558
yeah

861
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,778
did you want to mention TGA or talk to

862
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,840
speak to TGA

863
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:15,419
I mean sure yeah uh

864
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,099
I mean that was a that was a hard one I

865
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,259
you know he's even hard to talk about

866
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:20,398
after passing you can't like let alone

867
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:22,740
not even talking about using his

868
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,339
genetics just speaking about it

869
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,140
um

870
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:28,859
because of all the things that happened

871
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,778
prior like right before last two years

872
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,219
um got pretty wild and hairy and humans

873
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:34,500
were human especially when they find out

874
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,860
they're no longer living some will make

875
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,140
amends with people and some will live

876
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,538
their life to the fullest that they see

877
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,220
fit you know and that's kind of what

878
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:46,319
happened there

879
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,778
um mostly what I see though in cannabis

880
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,980
is people being Sanctified after they

881
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:52,740
pass

882
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,240
um maybe unjustly Sanctified in many

883
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,919
ways

884
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,899
um and if you notice and like they give

885
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,100
they're given sainthood

886
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:01,918
um yeah

887
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,500
yeah I see that a lot like oh this guy

888
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,380
he was such a [ __ ] amazing breeder

889
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,700
collector he was legit newest [ __ ] and

890
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,200
it's like what

891
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,640
when he was alive he was one of the

892
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,278
biggest you know like not now you're

893
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,380
talking about just there's a lot of this

894
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:17,940
there's a lot because I mean people are

895
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,260
complex and not everybody's a good human

896
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,179
their whole life and some people are

897
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:24,058
really bad humans

898
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,559
um most of their life but when they die

899
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:28,200
in cannabis for some reason they get

900
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,440
sainthood though I think some people may

901
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,778
not see that same fate you know just

902
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,000
kind of I mean who you are even people

903
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:38,700
who are alive get that same Hood I mean

904
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,919
they may not deserve it yeah that's very

905
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,620
true that is very true

906
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:47,100
sainthood going on

907
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:50,339
uh yeah don't as we always say you know

908
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:54,178
um be very wary of having Heroes

909
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:56,038
kick over the statues so I say no don't

910
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,298
worship any statues don't have any

911
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:59,819
pedestals

912
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,980
because breed like breeders are all [ __ ]

913
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:03,599
ups like most of us are ex-junkies too

914
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,720
like whether whether they admit it or

915
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,759
not like most of us like have Shady pass

916
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,278
so a bunch of [ __ ] ups there's nothing

917
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:14,940
to look up to that's for damn sure

918
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,619
myself on a positive note I it is worth

919
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,538
kind of reiterating what you said before

920
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:22,139
which is that you know one of the least

921
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:23,460
I think or one of the um

922
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,038
one of the best things you could do is

923
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,960
just continue to gesture towards the

924
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,119
people whose work your work depends on

925
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,460
like in general whether they're whether

926
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:34,319
they're dead or alive exactly yeah I

927
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,360
always get always give thanks and just

928
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,058
not even just give thanks but just be

929
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,719
thankful in general like have that in

930
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,398
your heart like don't just say it like

931
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,380
how did your heart can carry with you

932
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,759
like in your projects like with the Lone

933
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,860
Star stuff like

934
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,919
I I try to think about that all the time

935
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:54,599
like I don't I don't let that slip from

936
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,038
from the picture you know and maybe

937
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,079
that's why I don't get ego with it

938
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:59,519
because it's not

939
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,558
you know what I mean like just have it

940
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,720
in your heart Harry carry that with you

941
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:06,538
don't just say it do it

942
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,398
yeah and I think I think for I said The

943
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:11,280
Syndicate it's clearly like a core value

944
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,559
to acknowledge

945
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,159
um that we are just one point on like a

946
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,719
long line of points you know in through

947
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,639
running through time

948
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,739
and that like

949
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,858
we wouldn't be here

950
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,658
without a lot a lot of a lot of my uh

951
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:29,098
Focus has been like trying to find

952
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,320
things that other breeders had already

953
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,940
made years ago that's been lost so it's

954
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,919
like

955
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,480
you know like things were made a long

956
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,098
time ago that were so good that we're

957
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,019
still digging them up like someone was

958
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,580
doing it right back then so good that

959
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:43,559
way better than what we have now even

960
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,960
you know so yeah

961
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,239
I don't know kind of a tangent

962
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,338
no it's cool I think it's you know I

963
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,378
think occasionally it's nice to have a

964
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,000
bit more of a like philosophical you

965
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:56,878
know ethical reflection on these things

966
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,800
so I think yeah breeding breeding ethics

967
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,118
is a uh one that I used to get asked a

968
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,560
lot on the live feeds you know about

969
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,440
breeding ethics how do you know if it's

970
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:07,259
okay do you ask a breeder

971
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,760
um you know that that's a I mean it's a

972
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,560
hard one to do because so many people

973
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,880
have different answers people go online

974
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,619
and they see breeders have different

975
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,338
reactions to people using their stuff

976
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:19,079
like I I almost like think it's silly

977
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:21,059
when people ask me if they can use my

978
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,380
stuff from stuff they bought for me you

979
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,920
know like but I know they're doing out

980
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,838
of respect but like for me like if you

981
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,940
bought a pack of seeds it's yours

982
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,279
whatever hell you want with it I don't

983
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,440
care whose it is you know like we put it

984
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,339
out there it's there to be put out and

985
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,338
if you use it that's

986
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,880
that is a her name's getting carried on

987
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,920
like if you use it there's nothing more

988
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,300
like to me special than seeing someone

989
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,500
that found something so unique and

990
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,480
special they wanted to bring it into

991
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,639
something and make it theirs

992
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,679
that to me is the ultimate win for a

993
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,539
breeder so when people get mad when

994
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,039
people like use males from their line or

995
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,559
use a female from their line or whatever

996
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,960
and want to kick back like to me it

997
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,119
blows my mind because the the

998
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,300
the respect has already been paid there

999
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,700
by them wanting to use it

1000
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,000
maybe that should be another recurring

1001
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:13,279
episode every year or so yeah probably

1002
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,280
um

1003
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,079
yeah ethics and morals in

1004
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,760
2023.24 yeah they definitely change over

1005
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,200
the years I'll tell you what they have

1006
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,180
changed it might be a good thing to

1007
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,098
revisit

1008
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:29,039
like the name game changed completely

1009
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:31,019
the name the name game that used to be

1010
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,519
one of the most deadly serious games we

1011
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:34,079
played in breeding was when we were

1012
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,380
picking names making sure we didn't step

1013
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,260
on any [ __ ] toes and at one point it

1014
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,579
was pretty there were still names out

1015
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,619
there you could use that hadn't been

1016
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,539
reused if they weren't super obvious you

1017
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,220
know you could have uniqueness in your

1018
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,079
name still

1019
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:50,578
um but you know if you weren't too

1020
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,140
creative it was very easy to step on

1021
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,300
toes and it wasn't like it is today

1022
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:56,159
where people were like whatever you know

1023
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,619
uh because there's so many names you

1024
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,659
can't avoid but you're using names now

1025
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,579
back then like people took that very

1026
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:04,559
serious with like messaging people watch

1027
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,880
your head like you better change that

1028
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,639
now or else

1029
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,338
you know yeah so yeah that's another

1030
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,559
thing that's definitely changed it is uh

1031
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:17,578
our policy today is were you here before

1032
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:20,338
me okay if not [ __ ] kick rocks kid

1033
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,140
that's the way I look at it you know are

1034
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,460
you here before me okay then you don't

1035
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,379
get to choose the name you don't get to

1036
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,599
keep the name the dick move we gotta

1037
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,599
start somewhere you know yeah

1038
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,900
okay whoa slight change of pace we come

1039
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,338
back to a much more practical set of

1040
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,358
questions I think

1041
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:41,578
okay

1042
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,078
um simple one I think from freezeblade

1043
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,539
you know when do you think is the best

1044
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,619
time to pull to to take clones or to

1045
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,619
take cuttings off plots

1046
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:55,078
it depends

1047
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,019
and what by it depends I mean any number

1048
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,960
of factors is it a Seedling mom is it a

1049
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:02,579
clone mom if it's a Seedling mom you

1050
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,960
know is it going to [ __ ] up the whole

1051
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:05,820
structure of the plant if I take the

1052
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,820
Clones or am I not really worried about

1053
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,859
that like there's many reasons like that

1054
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,660
that I go into when I'm taking clones or

1055
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:13,679
things that I take into account like is

1056
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,420
this going to be something that I'm

1057
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,219
flowering out am I taking clones in a

1058
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,960
specific spot from the plant to make it

1059
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:21,480
have a specific structure when it's

1060
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,358
flowering you know yeah because that's a

1061
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,400
big part of what what part of the plants

1062
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:28,739
clones I'm taking how many I take the

1063
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,358
shape of it that all goes into it

1064
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,919
usually for me I wait till it's about

1065
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:34,199
two to three feet tall before I start

1066
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,180
making clones you know some people do it

1067
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:38,039
at the first two nodes you know like

1068
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:40,078
once there's a leaf material to take and

1069
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:43,199
there's a node bam take it

1070
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,960
um you know anything like that you can

1071
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:49,319
get in that context do you see have you

1072
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,480
experienced or observed um maturity

1073
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,039
playing a very big role in the success

1074
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,740
of routine

1075
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,320
or not necessarily

1076
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:00,539
um you know nothing that I could like

1077
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,400
not good anecdotes that I could give but

1078
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm sure there is you know hormonally a

1079
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,139
plant changes over time so I'm sure I'm

1080
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,639
sure there is but yeah what I'm talking

1081
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,838
about they're already so big at that

1082
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,779
point that you're not really worried

1083
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,119
about the maturity as much I mean uh and

1084
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,820
when I run my plants I usually run uh

1085
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,140
veggie 24 hours light almost always I I

1086
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,579
can't think of a situation where I've

1087
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:23,279
been running anything less than 24 hours

1088
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,660
in Veg it's constant constantly on and

1089
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,700
the reason I do that is because I also

1090
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:29,519
do a lot of re-veging

1091
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:32,460
um yeah and do in saying that like I

1092
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,920
mean my plants grow pretty fast uh in

1093
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:38,220
veg because the lights are on 24 hours

1094
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,900
so yeah um

1095
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:41,639
two to three feet

1096
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,358
they're not you know there's no heavy

1097
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:47,480
pre-flowering going on so yeah

1098
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:51,598
what do you think of uh people taking

1099
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,579
cuttings in the flowering stretch I know

1100
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,960
that's quite common slash popular as

1101
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,539
well I guess because you know you get so

1102
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,240
much like extra vegetative growth often

1103
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:01,980
that you have to get rid of anyway

1104
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,959
um what do you think of pulling cuttings

1105
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,460
at that point

1106
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,679
um so what point are you talking about

1107
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,838
later in flower or early in flower no

1108
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,299
sir during the flowering stretch first

1109
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,858
few weeks okay yeah no that's great um a

1110
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,180
lot of times they'll have stems that'll

1111
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:17,159
root better too

1112
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,539
I don't know why but like they have what

1113
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,980
are your stems and for some reason I I

1114
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,639
have better luck with Woody or stems

1115
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,800
like that or harder stems

1116
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,539
um and hormonally I think they're for

1117
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,220
whatever reason they're more able to

1118
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:31,440
root at that stage hormonally because

1119
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,199
they do root faster I found that out

1120
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,820
just by process of

1121
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,759
like

1122
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,680
thinking I had something backed up and

1123
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,300
clones backed up going to flower

1124
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,739
something starting in flower and

1125
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,780
realizing oh [ __ ] I don't have any more

1126
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,459
clones of this and then having to take

1127
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,900
loans that way that's when I started

1128
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,400
realizing that there was kind of a

1129
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,920
difference between how fast they would

1130
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,660
root how well they would root

1131
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,539
um and the type of routes they gave off

1132
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:00,179
even you know what I mean so yeah that's

1133
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,519
I've run into that that just by

1134
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:04,440
happenstance you know but it is

1135
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,259
effective

1136
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,700
when you take cuttings at that point do

1137
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,460
you have to deal with re-veging or not

1138
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:13,379
really it just depends sometimes but but

1139
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,059
usually it's not a very super long rib

1140
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,579
Edge if anything it's like a week or two

1141
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,320
Max but um if you get it at the right

1142
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,880
time not usually it'll it'll revert

1143
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,160
pretty quick

1144
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,740
it's cool yeah nice

1145
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,500
that was uh

1146
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:31,199
good juicy bit of info I love re-veging

1147
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,699
I love it I it makes me sad when people

1148
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,919
say that they don't do it I don't know

1149
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,139
why it's just to me it's so easy to do

1150
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,240
and I I just I don't have a lot of

1151
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:40,379
talents in life

1152
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,759
um but okay even when it comes to

1153
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,019
Growing like there's I don't have a lot

1154
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,300
of talents when it comes to Growing but

1155
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:47,400
I'm like better at this than anyone else

1156
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,560
or better at that than anyone else but

1157
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,720
I'm really good at revenging and I'm

1158
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:52,619
really good at popping seeds like those

1159
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,899
are two things that I can do

1160
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:56,039
exceptionally well and re-veging to me

1161
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,619
like

1162
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,079
it's something I could teach anyone at

1163
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:03,900
any time and it's as long as you follow

1164
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,880
like a few simple [ __ ] rules anybody

1165
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,039
could do it anytime as long as you can

1166
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,380
put your lights on 24 hours guaranteed

1167
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,420
yeah but a lot of people do have trouble

1168
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,079
with it and I don't understand it

1169
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,338
um

1170
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,260
I don't know it's just one of those

1171
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:18,119
things I've never gotten why people

1172
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,440
black troubles or veggies yeah awesome

1173
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,940
technique I guess to me you have to be

1174
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,099
very patient

1175
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,858
yeah I guess to me the main costs of

1176
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:27,420
re-veging would be space and time right

1177
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:30,960
um and money

1178
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,519
and money well yes yeah but the 24-hour

1179
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,019
light like a lot of people don't want to

1180
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,119
do that because it's like doubling your

1181
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:40,500
flower cycle of money you know what I

1182
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,660
mean yeah it can get uh and get more

1183
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,400
expensive that extra six hours of hour

1184
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,399
hours of light a night is uh

1185
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,279
okay

1186
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,680
that was a good one okay

1187
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,260
um we can move on to Digger's question

1188
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,299
and I I think you had a sense of what

1189
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,180
he's asking here I'm not entirely clear

1190
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,180
okay it says pros and cons of steering a

1191
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,279
line or clone with males a color

1192
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,858
flowering time and stability of the male

1193
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,300
or males use

1194
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:14,578
so so what he's talking about I think is

1195
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,000
using like using the mail

1196
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:21,720
and breeding using the mail as basically

1197
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,280
a stud using are all of his traits onto

1198
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,219
the females and yeah I mean you could do

1199
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,960
it it's you can do it with a female or

1200
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:31,318
with a male it doesn't really matter

1201
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,179
there's no set there's nothing set with

1202
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:36,659
like all males

1203
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,519
bring this straight all females breed

1204
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:41,219
this way you know like there's nothing

1205
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,739
it is so variable down to the the plant

1206
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,118
and environment on what traits are

1207
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,578
passed

1208
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,200
that like

1209
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:51,240
it's it's a very hard question to answer

1210
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,500
but yes you can absolutely you know like

1211
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,598
with the Bonnet stuff that's exactly

1212
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,639
what I did was bringing towards the nail

1213
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,960
that was it was what you which you would

1214
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,578
actually consider a stud because I

1215
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,159
wanted everything to be blueberry that

1216
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:04,500
he touched and yeah and historically

1217
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,899
it's been done a lot right yeah this is

1218
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,679
a very common passion

1219
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,740
um

1220
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,899
yes and no yes yes in the way of like

1221
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:15,539
skunk one

1222
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,780
um was used as a male a lot nl1 was used

1223
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:20,639
as a mail a lot by Neville but overall

1224
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,280
there's been a lot of seed making with

1225
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,799
males there's not been a lot of breeding

1226
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,880
done with a male for trait selection

1227
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,900
like that

1228
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,300
true

1229
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,858
yeah good distinction yeah

1230
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,740
okay

1231
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:36,539
that's a good question

1232
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,699
um anything else on that if not we

1233
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:41,219
cannot I think that's good

1234
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:43,439
Stone root what are your thoughts on

1235
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:45,598
convergent evolution through breeding

1236
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,760
starting with rather different cultivars

1237
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,460
by ending up in the same place through a

1238
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,140
series of generations uh he says similar

1239
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,480
to crabs in the ocean have you

1240
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:57,118
experienced this I mean okay one thing

1241
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,519
I'll say though right away is that crabs

1242
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,338
in the ocean were not bread yeah they

1243
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,079
evolved yeah um and I know what he means

1244
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:05,338
he means that like throughout the

1245
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,460
different

1246
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:10,559
eras of creatures on the planet quite a

1247
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,000
few different

1248
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,799
um species I don't know how the right

1249
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,659
taxonomy here but quite a few different

1250
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,240
species have kind of converged on a

1251
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:20,879
similar morphology a very crab-like

1252
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,559
morphology throughout time

1253
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,880
um I don't know if that is conflatable

1254
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,739
with breeding because breeding is

1255
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,900
actually active because he said two

1256
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:30,799
different cultivars but that would mean

1257
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,800
they were both cannabis

1258
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:34,500
I think the crab thing was meant to be

1259
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,598
an analogy I'm just kind of explaining

1260
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,519
why the analogy doesn't really make I

1261
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,260
know but like with this question he said

1262
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,420
two different cultivars but it sounds

1263
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,280
like you just said with different he

1264
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,619
just said with different cultivars but

1265
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,300
so not even necessarily cannabis is he

1266
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,740
talking about just can't two different

1267
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,160
candidates yeah yeah sorry he does he

1268
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:55,199
does mean cannabis I'm assuming yeah

1269
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,179
so like I was saying to you before the

1270
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,500
recording like the the most obvious

1271
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,799
thing that comes to mind that it's not

1272
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,619
breeding is what happens when you let

1273
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,140
you just let cat like you know maybe uh

1274
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:09,180
drug type cannabis like go wild right

1275
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,098
yeah yeah you can watch it regress very

1276
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:13,980
quickly to him to him in a few

1277
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,599
Generations yeah but I don't know if you

1278
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,099
this makes sense if you're talking about

1279
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,099
it from a breeding perspective

1280
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:22,619
I mean

1281
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,358
the only thing I can think of from a

1282
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,640
breeding perspective that even remotely

1283
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:29,818
comes close to this is someone currently

1284
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,639
Crossing Hops and cannabis

1285
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:34,800
Cannabis sativa you know like right a

1286
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,779
few different kind of semi-related

1287
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,760
plants and finding a way to interbreed

1288
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,260
them but it's not done evolutionarily

1289
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,760
it's not done naturally it was done

1290
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,720
through breeding

1291
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,339
um

1292
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,379
like what he's talking about takes

1293
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:50,900
thousands and thousands and thousands of

1294
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:54,119
years you know like Evolution I it's yes

1295
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,460
for Humanity yeah yeah yeah unless we're

1296
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,358
talking about major major like GMO type

1297
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,420
stuff

1298
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,739
um Advanced science techniques you know

1299
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,240
um yeah and I wouldn't know anything

1300
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:04,679
about that

1301
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,479
no I think you make a really good point

1302
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,519
like you can't really have Evolution and

1303
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,400
breeding in the same like sentence they

1304
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:13,199
don't work like they don't yeah they're

1305
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,760
not simpatico

1306
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,679
yeah

1307
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,460
okay there you go nice and Loud there

1308
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:21,899
you go move on to screwstone skate cross

1309
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,940
question

1310
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:27,000
okay this is an interesting one so he

1311
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,940
says we uh men also have talked about

1312
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,739
growing for seed versus going for flower

1313
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,740
production

1314
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:37,618
um but what about the difference between

1315
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:41,539
having a what he calls a regular veg

1316
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:44,400
setup uh versus a setup that's more for

1317
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:46,199
uh preservation I guess uh you know

1318
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,960
keeping moms

1319
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:51,719
um how how different are those setups

1320
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,800
or can they be how different can they be

1321
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:58,858
from seed making to keeping moms

1322
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,539
no I think he means like production like

1323
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:02,460
what what are the difference between

1324
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:04,259
differences between a setup that you're

1325
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,139
using just to like grow plants to grow

1326
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,540
plants for I guess for cropping

1327
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:12,118
um versus a setup that's just for

1328
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:14,039
keeping stuff okay so

1329
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,260
if I were doing just cropping I would

1330
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,059
probably be doing a lot in tables

1331
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,740
a ton

1332
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:21,900
um if I'm keeping moms you can't really

1333
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:23,759
keep moms in tables I mean maybe you can

1334
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,059
I don't know anybody who does but

1335
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,640
usually like can you explain a bit why

1336
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:31,199
um I mean because they get so big

1337
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,059
you know you can't really have those big

1338
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,139
monster moms in in tables especially if

1339
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:36,000
you're keeping them around a long time

1340
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:37,078
and it also depends like some people

1341
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,880
like to

1342
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,200
do clone of their mom clone of their mom

1343
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,760
clone of the mom keep it small

1344
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,960
constantly clone them on clone of the

1345
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,119
Mom it's a lot of work you can do it

1346
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,519
that way and keep it small

1347
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,338
um and that's the way you could do it in

1348
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,099
tables technically you could also use

1349
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:54,420
tables and re-vege so there's not really

1350
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,300
any

1351
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,619
there's workarounds for every situation

1352
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,380
but ideally like

1353
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,960
if I'm if I if I have moms I have a

1354
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,900
whole room dedicated to that of just

1355
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,679
moms in pots in containers in Cocoa you

1356
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,400
know

1357
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,259
um

1358
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,480
and then if I'm running production

1359
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,520
whether it's usually if I'm running

1360
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,318
production for me I do it all in the

1361
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,259
same pot and stuff like that but it's

1362
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,119
because I rent and if I owned a place I

1363
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,160
would be doing all [ __ ] tables all

1364
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,440
day all day long

1365
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:29,519
um so I guess the only difference would

1366
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,400
be how you keep the moms longer in a mom

1367
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,780
room I don't really know like

1368
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,579
yeah I think like you were saying

1369
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,440
earlier it depends right it depends on

1370
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,180
it depends on what constraints you have

1371
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,760
yeah like if you don't have a lot of

1372
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:43,318
space then you might have to resort to

1373
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,839
what you were pointing out before like

1374
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:48,179
what I call like serial cloning where

1375
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,039
you don't actually have a mom that

1376
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:52,379
you're constantly just taking clones off

1377
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:54,119
you have like a chain you're you're

1378
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,920
cloning and then taking a clone off that

1379
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,559
clone and and doing that successively

1380
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,838
through time I did that for years man I

1381
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,539
did it for years that way Solo Cup moms

1382
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,099
Bonsai moms which is horrible like I

1383
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:07,318
didn't understand like

1384
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:10,859
I didn't understand that I was like

1385
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:12,420
super stunting [ __ ] and like then now

1386
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:14,279
I'm gonna take that and breed with this

1387
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,800
super stunted plant because I made a

1388
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,880
bonsai mom out of it you know like I

1389
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,680
didn't understand what I was doing back

1390
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,720
then and I don't know that I don't know

1391
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,699
the ramifications that has for the

1392
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,919
future of what I made back then with

1393
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,838
that and

1394
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,960
yeah just thinking about that that was

1395
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:32,159
yeah

1396
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,659
recycled clones

1397
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,338
that's actually a really big question

1398
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:38,279
but I think we still don't really have

1399
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:40,619
great answers for which is yeah like you

1400
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,420
say if let's say you have a mom and then

1401
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,180
you've kind of had to you've been forced

1402
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:47,519
to uh stress slash traumatize it in

1403
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:49,679
various ways to keep it small what kind

1404
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,960
of impact that does have on clones you

1405
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,039
take off it later right and or even the

1406
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,019
seeds that you make with it

1407
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,519
epigenetically yeah

1408
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:58,679
yeah

1409
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:00,059
yeah you know I don't know what happened

1410
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,858
there

1411
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:04,619
yeah so maybe this is something you know

1412
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:07,019
if anyone in the community has an idea

1413
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:09,180
um or has seen any theory around this

1414
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,739
like definitely let us know Chimera if

1415
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:12,960
you want just let me know

1416
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:14,578
yeah

1417
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,260
uh I guess the other side of this in

1418
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,940
terms of setup is like I can think of

1419
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,700
things like

1420
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,400
um basic things uh that you probably

1421
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,558
have already thought through like what

1422
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,019
kinds of other differences in like say

1423
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,519
light intensity the feeding I know

1424
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:31,380
you've covered a bit of that but yeah

1425
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,659
feeding definitely

1426
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,940
light intensity here's a weird one a

1427
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:37,618
kind of it's on the topic but kind of a

1428
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,740
tangent a lot of us are getting news

1429
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:42,838
like a lot of us I mean like the oldest

1430
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:44,338
ones of us are just getting used to LEDs

1431
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:47,338
now or just getting to try them for the

1432
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:49,199
first time and it is so [ __ ]

1433
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,880
different like how the plants eat and

1434
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,338
everything it's so massively different

1435
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,599
so yeah interesting there are a lot of

1436
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:56,578
things to take into account too just

1437
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:58,140
from light intensities on Feed and all

1438
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,660
that [ __ ] not just for breeding but for

1439
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:03,659
anything you know

1440
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:06,480
yeah and that's I'm someone who's only

1441
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:08,519
ever had LEDs you know yeah yeah see

1442
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,559
that's a trip for me like I started on

1443
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,440
magnetic ballasts and t5s and [ __ ] like

1444
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,420
that and like I still have t5s that I

1445
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,880
would use because I'm [ __ ] old and

1446
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,200
like I think that's a legit technology I

1447
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,760
don't know I never I've never moved on

1448
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:22,318
to LEDs mostly because I'm broke and

1449
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,180
cheap but

1450
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,980
if anybody wants to be an LED sponsor

1451
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:28,558
get a hold of me

1452
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,960
there you go Gotta use this [ __ ]

1453
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,059
absolutely

1454
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,519
okay anything else about the differences

1455
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:36,960
between you know keeping plants for an

1456
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,239
archive versus keeping plants for

1457
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,500
production any changes in your obviously

1458
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,779
there's a different mindset you know

1459
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,900
obviously it's a different strategy

1460
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,900
um

1461
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:51,480
okay or if nothing else there we go all

1462
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:54,240
right no I can't think of anything else

1463
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,679
we can move on to South Coast Canada's

1464
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,019
question

1465
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,659
random one but does a male have

1466
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:02,940
different traits as a okay I guess what

1467
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:06,118
he's asking here is uh how differently

1468
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:08,099
can a male plant but I think it doesn't

1469
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:09,838
have to be just about a male how

1470
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:13,079
differently can a plant Express when

1471
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,219
seed ground versus like you know uh as a

1472
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,619
cutting

1473
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:18,539
vastly different vastly different it's

1474
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:20,160
why I always say like if you're really

1475
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:23,519
serious about it

1476
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:27,960
about like a line and hunting through it

1477
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:29,639
do run at all as seeds flower them and

1478
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,019
then run it as clones before you toss

1479
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,879
them because sometimes that change might

1480
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:34,318
be so drastic that the Terps changed so

1481
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,000
far that it you might have already

1482
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:38,400
tossed a keeper if you haven't run it

1483
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,318
the second time can can you break this

1484
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,358
down a little bit Matt because I know

1485
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:44,699
that like in the past whatever I

1486
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:47,639
remembered you saying like I know for

1487
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:52,139
example that the expression of um

1488
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:53,699
intersex Expressions change a lot right

1489
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,679
um but now you're actually saying that

1490
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:57,539
even

1491
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:59,759
Expressions might be different sent

1492
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:01,079
um internode spacing all kinds it's

1493
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,359
because it's there's so many different

1494
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,760
hormones packed into that seedling mom

1495
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:08,519
which is why it grows so different and

1496
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,380
as you as it ages as you take clones of

1497
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:12,659
that those hormones start to wear out

1498
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,579
you know and and you get to see a

1499
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:16,139
totally different plant it just grows

1500
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:19,619
totally different as a as a clone

1501
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:21,779
different root system everything

1502
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:23,880
yeah another thing like that for me

1503
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,819
anyway I don't really mean science

1504
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,440
there's no main Taproom on a on a clone

1505
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:32,420
you know like there's not like that big

1506
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:35,700
hard main Tapper like a Seedling gets

1507
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,960
this is another one where I think you

1508
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:39,000
know there probably is quite a lot of

1509
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,460
science underneath and oh yeah again if

1510
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,079
anyone can chip in on this topic we

1511
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,358
could probably revisit this because it

1512
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,640
is quite an interesting and big one I

1513
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,199
think awesome

1514
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:50,519
okay

1515
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,618
um was there anything else in terms of

1516
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:54,300
differences that you could think of just

1517
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,400
you know beyond the fact that they are

1518
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,539
going to be potentially pretty major

1519
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,818
ones

1520
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:02,400
any anecdotes in particular Matt that

1521
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:04,019
you can think of or

1522
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,119
um I mean it's just something that we

1523
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:07,920
see every single time that we run a

1524
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:10,559
plant like every single time it's going

1525
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,780
to change from um seedling and not all

1526
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,519
of them change drastically some some are

1527
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,780
real minor changes just you know a

1528
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,818
little leaf shape

1529
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,500
um width sometimes you'll just see that

1530
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:22,318
or a little bit stockier a little bit

1531
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:25,858
longer but sometimes it can be Worlds

1532
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:28,380
Apart you know um that bubble gum clone

1533
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:30,239
of the Northern Lights 5 was so pink

1534
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:33,838
bubble gum when we first got it

1535
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:35,399
yeah you're mind blown right but as a as

1536
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,440
a clone

1537
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,920
about Third Generation in it's a lot

1538
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,559
less pink bubble gummy a lot less

1539
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,659
it's one of those examples

1540
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,240
yeah this is a this is a fascinating

1541
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:51,058
topic I think yeah oh yeah a lot of

1542
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,979
complexity here it's a ton and and it is

1543
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:55,079
very sciency we've got a couple of

1544
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,019
questions from in the wind and I think

1545
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,839
generally what I get from in the wins

1546
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:02,460
questions here is he's taken into

1547
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:05,219
account some of the theory that we've

1548
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,139
explained in the previous episodes

1549
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:10,019
and on some of the complexities of

1550
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:12,659
breathing like we pointed out there are

1551
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:14,039
uh linked linked traits I.E genes that

1552
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:15,779
are linked or grouped together for

1553
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,500
whatever reason

1554
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,839
um

1555
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,280
and you know the inverse of that we

1556
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,318
talked about I think where we you could

1557
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,800
even have multiple genes controlling a

1558
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:28,019
single trait yeah um and so for me the

1559
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,839
vibe I get from him is like okay that

1560
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:32,519
that that sounds like breeding is like

1561
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:34,259
impossible or like intentional breeding

1562
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:36,780
is impossible because of these

1563
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:39,059
conditions and obviously it's it it's

1564
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,339
true that it's extremely difficult to to

1565
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:43,619
make predictable

1566
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:44,940
um but okay we'll get into his first one

1567
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:47,160
which is

1568
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:50,519
how much of our assessment of linked

1569
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:53,098
traits and true breeding traits

1570
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:55,318
um can actually be observed in like can

1571
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:57,720
actually be observed full stop

1572
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:59,159
um that's kind of what I see in this

1573
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:00,179
question he says how much of it is like

1574
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,480
visual

1575
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:07,639
um and can be perceived through effect

1576
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,639
all of its visual except for effect

1577
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:11,639
yeah

1578
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:13,318
trying to think am I correct in saying

1579
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:15,980
that I think so like most of the traits

1580
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:15,980
that we breed for

1581
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:25,739
observable in some way except for the

1582
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:28,019
high

1583
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:29,879
that's always going to be variable for

1584
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:31,739
every single person every single

1585
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,260
different time like

1586
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:36,000
trying to explain this to the the like

1587
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,280
normal person who goes into a collective

1588
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,380
they're so mindset on thing oh do I need

1589
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,200
a sativa indica or hybrid you know like

1590
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:46,980
that's where their mindset's at whereas

1591
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,960
like in my mindset I'm at I wonder if

1592
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,880
this Bud from this plant is going to

1593
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,800
affect me the same way it did last night

1594
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,500
when I was in a different mood because

1595
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:58,680
in reality that's where we should be at

1596
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:01,079
yeah like it's that variable

1597
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:04,019
um yeah so trying to quantify high and

1598
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,220
breeding for high very hard very hard

1599
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:06,659
because you never know if the next

1600
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:09,179
person is going to have the same higher

1601
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:10,139
the same reaction and you don't know

1602
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:11,460
that if you're gonna have the same

1603
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:12,838
higher reaction the next time you smoke

1604
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:17,460
it

1605
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:20,578
um yeah so in some sense it can be

1606
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:22,318
two variable to account for

1607
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:24,599
yeah but there are variables we can't

1608
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,159
account for and breed for it

1609
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,599
yeah so this is one of those questions

1610
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:31,019
where like there isn't a straightforward

1611
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:33,720
answer yeah like it depends on what

1612
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:36,119
traits you are interested in and of

1613
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,618
course within within the tools that you

1614
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,220
have like if all you have are your

1615
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:43,559
observations then obviously you can only

1616
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:45,899
um you can only depend on what You

1617
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,619
observe to exactly your decisions like

1618
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:51,480
this yeah there's just there's no magic

1619
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:53,519
shortcut to that if you don't have

1620
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,838
access to you know other kinds of

1621
00:58:53,519 --> 00:59:00,239
testing exactly the in this is where

1622
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,519
knowing your baselines having experience

1623
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,979
running out the baselines going through

1624
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,420
populations in the baselines in for

1625
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,460
Baseline see our previous episodes

1626
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,119
recent episodes

1627
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,179
um

1628
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,039
having that experience will help you to

1629
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:16,019
make those selections and see those

1630
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:19,558
traits that you're looking for and know

1631
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:21,900
okay well it reads about this common in

1632
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:23,460
this line it's about that common so

1633
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,318
hopefully I'll see it in this you know

1634
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:28,858
roughly this percentage in this

1635
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:30,779
population of this hybrid Etc you know

1636
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:32,039
um the more you Lo know the lines you're

1637
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,280
working with or clones you're working

1638
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:37,019
with the more educated you can be about

1639
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,298
making those distinctions and

1640
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:41,159
projections

1641
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:43,980
yeah

1642
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:46,739
and I think we we did talk about this as

1643
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:49,079
well which is that sometimes you do have

1644
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:51,779
to go forward and then go backwards

1645
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:54,780
because you just don't have any other

1646
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:57,180
way of getting more information yeah

1647
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:58,798
sometimes it's literally you have to run

1648
00:59:57,179 --> 01:00:00,239
the progeny and not everything's a hit

1649
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:03,380
you know

1650
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,379
yeah that's what it is

1651
01:00:04,019 --> 01:00:08,759
so his second question is I think we've

1652
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:12,539
more or less covered it but I'll I'll uh

1653
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:15,599
sound it out anyway okay so he said uh

1654
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:18,358
yeah how reliable is a you know visual

1655
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,740
uh sorry observable slash like smoke

1656
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:21,000
test in the search for Unique

1657
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:24,919
expressions

1658
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,920
and then he kind of goes into like

1659
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,240
uh is it possible for something to not

1660
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,160
express the trait in its first

1661
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:35,578
expression I guess it means in the first

1662
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,659
generation and then for that trait to

1663
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:38,880
appear in successive Generations

1664
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:40,259
obviously yes right yeah very very much

1665
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,599
so yeah

1666
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,760
um Tower recessive's work you know they

1667
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,338
pop up in the yeah and after these f3s

1668
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,960
you'll never see them in the f1s

1669
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:50,519
um or in that first generation crash as

1670
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,039
I should say

1671
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:55,858
um yeah that's that's that's

1672
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,199
it that's that's a part of it you know

1673
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:59,818
that's a major thing yeah and again I

1674
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,578
perceive underlying this question his

1675
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:06,239
his real question is how can I predict

1676
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:09,240
this and it's like it's the same answer

1677
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:12,000
it's like either you have very good

1678
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:14,818
information and previous experience on

1679
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,639
how what you're holding

1680
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:19,259
um does pass and breathe exactly or

1681
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:21,420
you're gonna have to actually

1682
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,880
do some work

1683
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,380
test the progeny and maybe do another

1684
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,000
generation if that's why you're looking

1685
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,740
you know if if you're trying to trace

1686
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,798
something down Generations you just have

1687
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:33,058
you can't avoid actually doing it yeah

1688
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:36,480
essentially

1689
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:39,119
you know in in to this point like

1690
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:43,559
I would rather see someone pop

1691
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:46,019
100 seeds in a very small space and

1692
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:48,660
flower them small to get an idea of the

1693
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:51,059
population then run two or three plants

1694
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:52,259
really big to try to get an idea of what

1695
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:55,260
a clone's like

1696
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:56,819
yeah you know like if if people are

1697
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,500
wondering like

1698
01:01:56,818 --> 01:02:00,298
which would be better which would be

1699
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,338
more ideal which would give them the

1700
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:04,079
most information

1701
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:06,719
um the smaller plants would give you the

1702
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:09,420
most information and that would be ideal

1703
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:11,759
um smaller plants can be just as terpy

1704
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,798
and potent as anything else and if we're

1705
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,059
going for assessing and learning about a

1706
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:16,679
plant

1707
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,480
um you know as long as it has enough Bud

1708
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:20,338
to get you a few [ __ ] bulls so you

1709
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,400
can get a pretty good idea if it's even

1710
01:02:20,338 --> 01:02:24,058
a high you enjoy you personally enjoy

1711
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,700
um

1712
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:28,980
yeah I mean just flower them out little

1713
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:30,179
clones little little seedlings it's easy

1714
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,760
to do

1715
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:35,219
yeah yeah so I guess my paraphrase for

1716
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,799
that is whenever you are looking for

1717
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:40,798
stuff you face significant odds and the

1718
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:45,298
only strategy that's viable is to go

1719
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:47,838
with numbers numbers always yeah

1720
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:47,838
yeah okay

1721
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:53,159
um

1722
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:55,318
we can move on okay NJ grow guy is

1723
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:58,798
asking a question that I think you know

1724
01:02:55,318 --> 01:03:00,358
is always the question in in a way

1725
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,539
um what is the best way to go about

1726
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:05,578
extending stock on a pack of seats I

1727
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:07,079
have a 12-pack and want to make more so

1728
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:11,640
I can grow them out again would you just

1729
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:13,798
op that pack or would you go and select

1730
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:15,900
um you know maybe do one-to-one with

1731
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:17,099
like your favorite from the pack

1732
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,980
um

1733
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:22,079
so so I in this case you know what I'd

1734
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:25,260
say I would say if you have like 12

1735
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,180
seeds I'd run them all I'd keep clones

1736
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:30,059
of each just in case

1737
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:31,798
now if it's already an open pollination

1738
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,359
there might not be a need to do a

1739
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:35,519
successive open pollination unless it's

1740
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:36,659
solely for preservation and like you

1741
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:38,219
feel like the last person probably

1742
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:40,259
didn't do that good of a job like if

1743
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:42,598
someone just did it for five seeds I

1744
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,700
would probably re-op it again just you

1745
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:46,440
know just because to bring out more

1746
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:47,879
examples but

1747
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,920
um

1748
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,920
yeah I don't know

1749
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,659
open pollinations are are great you know

1750
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,818
if this is solely for preservation do

1751
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:58,019
open pollinations but there's some lines

1752
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:00,119
where if like someone just didn't open

1753
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:02,280
pollination and

1754
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:04,380
it won't kill you to just do little

1755
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,000
selections from it to make the seeds you

1756
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,338
would be doing directional breeding in a

1757
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,380
sense and start that direction narrowing

1758
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:13,078
but I mean

1759
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,940
if it's plants that you like as opposed

1760
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:18,298
to just random and you've already run

1761
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:20,760
them then yeah that makes sense

1762
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:22,199
yeah yeah I think again this is one of

1763
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,180
those like it depends and it comes down

1764
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:27,000
to your constraints like yeah I imagine

1765
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:28,500
the risk with OP is that I think we did

1766
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,420
address this in the Theory episode as

1767
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:34,639
well is that

1768
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,639
it's easy to lose things

1769
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,880
um and it's not to say that you've lost

1770
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:40,440
them forever but that's why I say it

1771
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,119
comes down to your constraints like you

1772
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,380
have plenty of time in the future and

1773
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:48,119
you know you're going to have lots of

1774
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:50,880
time then maybe NOP is okay but

1775
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:52,880
yeah exactly

1776
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,318
if you like if you're doing an OP

1777
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,480
strictly so you can do a big ass pop

1778
01:04:55,318 --> 01:04:58,920
this one line that makes sense to me but

1779
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,960
if you're just oping it just to pop

1780
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,780
three seeds that doesn't make any sense

1781
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,539
yeah I think that's a good that's a good

1782
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,740
simile statement yeah

1783
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:09,480
okay

1784
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:11,519
Petty cheetah

1785
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,159
I've selected a stable female from an

1786
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,900
intersex prone lion and outcrusted to a

1787
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,659
male from a stable line

1788
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:21,539
in your experience despite choosing a

1789
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:23,699
stable individual how often do you think

1790
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:27,380
the intersex traits from the female side

1791
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:27,379
get passed into the progeny

1792
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,960
it depends again because we don't know

1793
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,000
if that trait is a late trait don't know

1794
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,039
much about that trait you know like for

1795
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,559
this particular example

1796
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:42,539
um typically typically generally

1797
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,519
speaking though if you're if you're

1798
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:46,739
breeding away from intersex trades let's

1799
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:49,739
say this line is very very

1800
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:51,179
um aren't prone and you find a a male

1801
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:52,919
from a line that's just super stable

1802
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:55,259
sexually

1803
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:58,079
um usually you're doing a great service

1804
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:00,660
to line if your end goal is to have no

1805
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,760
intersex trades that's that's what you

1806
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:04,798
want to do so that that's that's the

1807
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,359
best method for it if that's the trait

1808
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:09,599
you're trying to like

1809
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:11,960
suppress that's how you would do it

1810
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,960
yeah

1811
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,599
okay

1812
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:21,659
uh squirrel again is asking

1813
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:24,838
let me see

1814
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:26,779
so I think his question is

1815
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:30,000
we often address

1816
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:33,680
uh traits such as you know the most

1817
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,679
common ones like uh scent

1818
01:06:37,858 --> 01:06:42,659
and he's wondering like and we have

1819
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:44,699
talked a bit about this before but

1820
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:48,000
do you have much experience with people

1821
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:50,399
who have bred for bud structure for

1822
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,400
smoking specifically

1823
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,200
no um not that I know of but I mean

1824
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,000
maybe someone does out there that's an

1825
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,199
actual breeder but I don't know of it

1826
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,539
and I haven't had that discussion with

1827
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:04,439
anyone however I've talked about it

1828
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:07,440
because I I hate I [ __ ] hate with a

1829
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:10,440
passion super dense Bud like I like to

1830
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,900
break up I my preference has always been

1831
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,659
to break it up by hand really easy you

1832
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,220
know not not thumb it up super bad but I

1833
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:19,618
don't know how to handle bud you know

1834
01:07:17,219 --> 01:07:21,598
but I like to break it up by hand and

1835
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:23,760
pretty much nowadays I have to use a

1836
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,500
grinder every single time because this

1837
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,359
stuff is so dense

1838
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,920
that it was just it's pointless to try

1839
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,538
to break it apart like that and I don't

1840
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,400
like [ __ ] that dense

1841
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:34,740
um and a lot of customers don't eat it

1842
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,858
because it's usually mold prone like

1843
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:40,318
massively mold prone stuff like that so

1844
01:07:37,858 --> 01:07:43,139
yeah I was I was going to say that even

1845
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:46,019
if people in their work haven't been

1846
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:48,779
explicitly looking for

1847
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:51,838
um flower structure relative to smoking

1848
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:54,480
people certainly pay attention to how

1849
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,619
prone flowers out to Bud rot

1850
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,380
um this is true

1851
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,700
so that is often the kind of

1852
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:02,338
corresponding

1853
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:04,379
consideration like it definitely is yeah

1854
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:07,500
especially for the grower side more

1855
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:09,180
dense more density means more mold so I

1856
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,858
mean that's why I just can't I never

1857
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:12,899
could believe that cookies blew up like

1858
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:15,298
it did not only was it a smaller yielder

1859
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:18,359
but the density just made it a mold

1860
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:19,500
nightmare for people so yeah it just

1861
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,179
blows my mind

1862
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,920
I have a question here for you Matt

1863
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:25,739
which you know you know the Indiana

1864
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:28,798
bubble gum cut is often cited for being

1865
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:32,218
really mold resistant yeah

1866
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:34,319
do you uh in your opinion like is it

1867
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:35,880
partly the structure of the flower that

1868
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,859
contributes to that or is there other

1869
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,259
are there other qualities you think I

1870
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:42,480
mean I I it's it's destroy it's pretty

1871
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:45,420
dense it's not as dense as like cookies

1872
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:47,099
but it's very dense Afghanistan yeah

1873
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:49,259
it's just one of those things where the

1874
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:52,620
genetics it's just very mold resistant

1875
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:54,659
it's yeah so it's an example where it

1876
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:56,159
wasn't it wasn't it's not necessarily

1877
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:57,079
because of the flower structure that is

1878
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,719
exactly

1879
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:03,778
okay like um a lot of the urn beer stuff

1880
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,819
the Swiss sativa strawberry stuff also

1881
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,380
tends to be mold resistant and I don't

1882
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:09,539
like early on I was trying to figure out

1883
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,460
if it was tied to its scent like

1884
01:09:09,539 --> 01:09:13,619
whatever the oils are in its glands you

1885
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,359
know whatever I never figured it out but

1886
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:17,159
strawberry stuff is extremely mold

1887
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,859
resistant as well

1888
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:21,838
interesting interesting

1889
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:23,100
yeah because I guess yeah paraphrase of

1890
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:24,899
that is

1891
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,060
the other obvious way something can be

1892
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:30,479
mold resistant is presumably through its

1893
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,679
cannabinoid like balance and all that

1894
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,099
yep

1895
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,100
okay

1896
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:42,298
um that might actually be the end of our

1897
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:42,298
questions today Matt bruh

1898
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:48,480
well we are at the end of the questions

1899
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:52,698
I know that

1900
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:52,698
you wanted to talk about something else

1901
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,619
yeah

1902
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:01,380
um which one should I talk about first

1903
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:04,140
so did you want to talk about your your

1904
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:06,900
recent experience with cereal milk

1905
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:08,460
and tell us what that is and what I'll

1906
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:11,779
tell you about my experience the the

1907
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,779
rundown on it so

1908
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:16,139
I wanted to check out some of these new

1909
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:18,179
buds

1910
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,400
because I had not tried cereal milk I

1911
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:22,859
had not tried jealousy

1912
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:24,299
there's a bunch I hadn't tried from a

1913
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:25,799
lot of the hype stuff not just cookie

1914
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,119
fam stuff but in general generally

1915
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,260
speaking

1916
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,599
um a lot of the newer stuff I haven't

1917
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:33,119
tried and people ask me a lot about it

1918
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,460
and my normal comment is well what is it

1919
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,979
is cookies crust or cookies probably

1920
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:39,719
trash you know like in my opinion that's

1921
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:41,879
usually what you get

1922
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,198
anyway I I got some

1923
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,640
and I probably should have taken

1924
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:47,039
pictures but I figured it's cereal milk

1925
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,619
I'm probably not going to enjoy it so

1926
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,238
I mean I was that confident that I would

1927
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:53,460
not enjoy this stuff

1928
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:56,519
I mean that is a bias coming with the

1929
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:58,260
bias to not wanting to enjoy this and

1930
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,000
now you're not wanting to but expecting

1931
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:02,579
to not enjoy it

1932
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,219
so the bud shows up I look at it it's

1933
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:06,859
very dense looks like cookies cool

1934
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:10,079
um expected

1935
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:11,819
and the density is just exactly like I

1936
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,340
hate hard to break up

1937
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:15,899
and there's not a lot of scent to it I

1938
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,640
was expecting cereal milk to smell like

1939
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:19,738
the sweet end of OG that actually smells

1940
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,659
like cereal milk so like I thought the

1941
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:23,519
name would be apropos and some kind of

1942
01:11:21,658 --> 01:11:25,679
extension of that because that exists in

1943
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,780
that line why would you not choose that

1944
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,039
expression to represent it but they

1945
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:29,698
didn't

1946
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:31,859
um

1947
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:35,238
I think the name is a misnomer scent

1948
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:35,238
wise it was very

1949
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:38,339
Bland

1950
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,119
um Terps

1951
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,520
which also threw me off as far as like

1952
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:47,579
I'm expecting this to not be very good

1953
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,440
it's Surplus in a sense

1954
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:50,880
I can't really even pin down a scent for

1955
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:55,859
you on what it smelled like it was just

1956
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:58,500
ashy maybe at best so

1957
01:11:55,859 --> 01:12:00,179
I smoke it

1958
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,619
and about 30 minutes in I'm already

1959
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:03,179
expecting this thing to be over and I'm

1960
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:04,140
like I'm actually enjoying this I'm

1961
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:06,300
giggly

1962
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,880
this is giggly weed

1963
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:11,820
and it was strong I had been dabbing

1964
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,859
diamonds and sauce all day and it broke

1965
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:16,500
through and

1966
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:18,119
it repeatedly did that until the very

1967
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,619
last bowl

1968
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:22,800
so

1969
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:25,559
because I I spend so much time talking

1970
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,779
about like cookies being the end of

1971
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,420
breeding as far as like the the very end

1972
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:32,399
of where you can take that line

1973
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,020
um I don't know much about Snowman and

1974
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:36,119
Wildlife obviously it's some kind of

1975
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,460
cookies cookies you know

1976
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:39,599
but I was impressed and I felt like I

1977
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,340
like

1978
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,280
even though

1979
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,560
I want so badly not to say that cereal

1980
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:48,779
milk is is decent like it was pretty

1981
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,800
[ __ ] decent and I was surprised

1982
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:52,800
um

1983
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,960
yeah so because I talked so much [ __ ] I

1984
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,699
had to actually you know man up and say

1985
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,920
that it was it was good I was surprised

1986
01:12:56,698 --> 01:13:01,019
and and I'm gonna try to do that more

1987
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:04,739
often grab some stuff now and then from

1988
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:06,480
newer stuff and you know maybe do some

1989
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:08,939
reviews for people so that they can see

1990
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:11,819
it and get an idea of someone who's more

1991
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:13,678
used to Old School strains what my

1992
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:14,880
opinion would be on stuff like that if

1993
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,119
it's worth a [ __ ] because I was

1994
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,800
surprised I was hella surprised that I

1995
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:21,899
would even run that clone it was that

1996
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,060
good and even though it was turpless I

1997
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:26,158
like I wouldn't if I was an extractor I

1998
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:28,739
would never run that [ __ ] but the high

1999
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,059
from it was exceptional and um I don't

2000
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,279
think the grower was anything special

2001
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,679
but I do think that I was exceptional so

2002
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:36,359
yeah I got to give him props where it's

2003
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:38,399
dude they had someone make them a good

2004
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:40,259
line

2005
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,299
and I guess it's still consistent You

2006
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,699
know despite with what we say like

2007
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:47,820
despite of course us enjoying bashing on

2008
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:50,359
cookies for various good reasons yeah um

2009
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:53,279
there's obviously no reason why

2010
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:56,158
outlies within that you know can appear

2011
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:58,259
and be good yeah it's just the part that

2012
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:59,879
blew my mind though was that it didn't

2013
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,159
look like anything different than a

2014
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:04,500
gelato you know it looked nothing

2015
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,179
different than gelato 33 you'd look at

2016
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,140
it be like oh that's a lot of 33. you

2017
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:11,279
know

2018
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:13,380
the smell nothing to write home about at

2019
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:16,319
all in fact it was one of the more

2020
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:18,840
scentless buds that I've ever had

2021
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:20,519
but for whatever reason and like that

2022
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:24,119
totally shits on that Entourage effect

2023
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:25,679
type thing right like it totally you

2024
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:28,260
the opposite of how it should have

2025
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:31,380
worked in my brain if that's real

2026
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:34,020
um but it did it and it had a great

2027
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:36,659
[ __ ] high like markedly great

2028
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,400
something that I don't see in cookies so

2029
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:41,219
yeah it's it's definitely

2030
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:43,319
um that that clone at least or the the

2031
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:44,760
example maybe maybe it wasn't even

2032
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:47,099
cereal milk who [ __ ] knows it came

2033
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:50,280
from a dispensary so God knows but I'm

2034
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:52,079
pretty sure it was and uh yeah it was

2035
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:53,579
impressive

2036
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,960
what are the implications of this

2037
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:57,359
statement Matt are you are you telling

2038
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,520
everyone that cookies is great and that

2039
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,339
I'm gonna blow burner is what's gonna

2040
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,679
happen

2041
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:06,719
I'm gonna make me he's my puppy I guess

2042
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:08,699
I don't know what this means but it's uh

2043
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,198
what it means is that I need to start

2044
01:15:08,698 --> 01:15:13,019
giving some of these new things a try

2045
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:14,519
and see if if uh I can't break some of

2046
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:17,159
my own myths that I have in my head

2047
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,199
about them or I can't prove myself right

2048
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:21,539
but I'm determined now to at least like

2049
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:24,539
maybe once a week if I can afford it

2050
01:15:21,539 --> 01:15:29,460
because it's expensive man legal weeds

2051
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:31,260
expense the taxes on this unreal unreal

2052
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:33,239
so yeah

2053
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,219
um I would like to do that though once a

2054
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:37,919
week you know grab some grab one even

2055
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:39,600
one or two things and um

2056
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,819
you know like another thing that I got

2057
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:45,780
that I'd like to talk about that blew my

2058
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:47,519
mind to Mango Haze diamonds and it

2059
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:50,698
didn't blow my mind for the reasons that

2060
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,860
you think it would it blew my mind that

2061
01:15:50,698 --> 01:15:55,439
someone would grow like a 14 to 16 week

2062
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:56,519
plant and then extract it down to

2063
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:59,519
Diamonds

2064
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:02,540
what the [ __ ] was that who came up with

2065
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:05,820
that idea and why did I buy it but I did

2066
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:07,979
I did and there was no scent to it

2067
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:10,019
really it was just diamonds it didn't

2068
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:12,779
have an exceptional high at all there

2069
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:15,659
was nothing Mingo hazy about the high to

2070
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:19,079
me you know like if it was used if it

2071
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:22,738
was a real 14 16 week grown mango Haze

2072
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:24,779
it was lost in the extraction but like I

2073
01:16:22,738 --> 01:16:26,939
don't see any of these people running a

2074
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:28,380
14 to 16 week Haze and extracting it so

2075
01:16:26,939 --> 01:16:30,419
it's probably around an eight and

2076
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:32,219
extracted you know and at that point you

2077
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,658
just have THC diamonds and you could

2078
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:35,520
have that from anything and it wouldn't

2079
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:37,859
matter because there's no

2080
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,239
nothing else with it except just THC and

2081
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:42,539
that's a very very

2082
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:45,539
specific High you know yeah so yeah it

2083
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:46,920
was almost offensive that um mango Haze

2084
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:49,019
diamonds existed and I couldn't believe

2085
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:51,600
they existed and I even tried them in

2086
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:54,360
hopes that they would be something good

2087
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,579
that they they just were diamonds

2088
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:58,380
yeah I can I can totally see why it's

2089
01:16:56,579 --> 01:17:00,000
offensive it's like sacrilegious like

2090
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:03,359
yeah it is

2091
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,039
why why like they could have done live

2092
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,279
resin sauce and I've been like [ __ ]

2093
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,439
dope but they did diamonds like straight

2094
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:12,000
just THC diamonds

2095
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:13,500
what

2096
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,779
yeah in which case why would you use

2097
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,640
something like mango Haze exactly why

2098
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:20,099
not you could use anything on Earth to

2099
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:22,860
do that why would you use a 14 16 week

2100
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:25,320
plan yeah so that was my experience at

2101
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:28,500
the uh local collectives there was some

2102
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:32,158
um a funny tale was that the place where

2103
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:34,800
I got the um Juicy Fruit tie clone

2104
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:36,599
add Juicy Fruit on their menu again so I

2105
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,539
was like what they're growing that again

2106
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,199
okay so I was gonna order it but I

2107
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:41,939
didn't

2108
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:42,960
I I don't remember why because I was

2109
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:44,819
buying everything else it was too damn

2110
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,619
expensive I just you know whatever but

2111
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:48,779
they gave me a full free ounce of their

2112
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:50,819
Juicy Fruit and Holy balls was the most

2113
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:53,279
moldy [ __ ] I've ever seen in my life

2114
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:55,439
I couldn't even identify if it was juicy

2115
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,819
fruit or not I'm like I had to be the

2116
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:58,859
[ __ ] that hits him I was like hey

2117
01:17:56,819 --> 01:18:00,299
bro that stuff you're giving out it's

2118
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:02,099
all moldy you might want to check that

2119
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,020
like it doesn't look good like even

2120
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,000
though it's free like you're repping

2121
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:07,199
your business you know

2122
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
yeah

2123
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:10,379
but yeah I won't say which business

2124
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,420
because they're nice and obviously they

2125
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,819
have my address but

2126
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:17,579
yeah I think that it's a great idea for

2127
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:18,539
you to periodically I don't know how

2128
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:20,460
often

2129
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:23,100
um get some products to review I think

2130
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:26,039
that's that's fun and like for me you

2131
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:29,400
know I have no other connection to

2132
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:32,158
dispensary land yeah right so if

2133
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:34,279
vicariously live through it

2134
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:34,279
yeah

2135
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:39,899
yeah that's that's that was my

2136
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:41,698
experience like um what else did I get I

2137
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:44,399
got some something called Inferno OG

2138
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:46,319
diamonds and that actually was like had

2139
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:49,799
some really

2140
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:52,799
loud loud OG sense to it in the diamonds

2141
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:54,179
it was really [ __ ] impressive like it

2142
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,739
was some of the best diamonds in the

2143
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:57,600
sauce I've ever had but it was just

2144
01:18:55,738 --> 01:19:00,539
diamonds but I didn't really see any

2145
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,340
sauce but it was so loud OG

2146
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:03,658
um smelling it was exactly like I would

2147
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,699
have wanted

2148
01:19:03,658 --> 01:19:08,339
um

2149
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:10,439
there was some uh Mars OG the place was

2150
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:13,380
selling and that was just absolute

2151
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:17,219
garbage it was uh just really poorly

2152
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:19,800
grown like Athena grown you know just

2153
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:21,899
[ __ ] smashed with nudes

2154
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,600
it was it was not good there's not like

2155
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:26,399
a really nice OG scent to it like I like

2156
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,679
or flavor that was gone it was just

2157
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,119
earthy really disappointing to be honest

2158
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:32,100
with you because I used to love Mars OG

2159
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:33,198
that was a really good OG

2160
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,280
um

2161
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:38,759
I can't really think of anything else

2162
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:40,738
that that jumped out that was uh of note

2163
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,300
I had a jack hero live resin sauce that

2164
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:44,939
wasn't that good it wasn't that special

2165
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:47,100
it wasn't even that Germany which is

2166
01:19:44,939 --> 01:19:49,139
weird for a jack her Alive's resin sauce

2167
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,360
but it was in there it just wasn't as

2168
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:53,760
loud

2169
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:55,259
um yeah overall disappointing I don't

2170
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,940
really do collectives like I've never

2171
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,800
really done that it had been a long time

2172
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:00,719
and it usually if I'd ever got anything

2173
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,100
from a collective it would be a clone if

2174
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,480
it's something that interested me you

2175
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,699
know like oh they got that there let's

2176
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,419
see if it's it you know

2177
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:10,139
um

2178
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:11,179
but yeah what a trip man what a trip the

2179
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:14,280
taxes

2180
01:20:11,179 --> 01:20:15,840
the trash level of it some of it

2181
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:17,759
surprisingly though like I said

2182
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,560
something was [ __ ] good I was

2183
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,140
surprised I was able to get something

2184
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:24,060
decent there yeah

2185
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,280
I mean I guess you could say the same of

2186
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,719
like collectives and dispensaries as as

2187
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:29,340
you just did about as we did about

2188
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,899
cookies in general like obviously it

2189
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:33,659
doesn't mean that like they're all bad

2190
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:35,399
and everything's bad it's just sure what

2191
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:38,039
the likelihood is

2192
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:39,779
um and yeah there's obviously still a

2193
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:42,300
chance that you can get some

2194
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:43,738
some good products what's funny is some

2195
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,539
of my friends are the people growing

2196
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:48,779
weed for cookies that goes in those

2197
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:51,800
mylars you know like yeah some of it's

2198
01:20:48,779 --> 01:20:51,800
good so

2199
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,440
well I don't know man is this a good

2200
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,840
point to like

2201
01:20:55,439 --> 01:21:00,599
do a little bit of an outro

2202
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,460
yeah I got the subscribers

2203
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,320
yeah yeah yeah exactly that's what I

2204
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,939
mean like okay yeah maybe this is where

2205
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:08,340
we talk about

2206
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:09,719
well we've decided that this is the end

2207
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,340
of this season

2208
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:14,239
um this episode that's one another

2209
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:17,940
series end of everything bye we're done

2210
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:20,099
finished we're out oh oh yeah that's

2211
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:21,599
right

2212
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,820
now we've covered everything man there's

2213
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:28,320
nothing else to say about anything so I

2214
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:30,119
mean thank God that's it for us yeah so

2215
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:32,219
one thing I did want to point out is

2216
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:35,039
that we just hit 7000 Subs which is

2217
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:36,480
pretty cool yeah

2218
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:38,399
it's

2219
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:40,500
I'll tell you why I'm proud of it one of

2220
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,539
the reasons is that I I occasionally go

2221
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:44,899
and look at other cannabis channels

2222
01:21:42,539 --> 01:21:48,238
especially ones that I really hate and

2223
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:51,779
one thing I've noticed that I think is

2224
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:53,579
so absurd but also so unsurprising is

2225
01:21:51,779 --> 01:21:55,859
that some of these channels you go in

2226
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:59,519
that you see they've got like 100 or

2227
01:21:55,859 --> 01:22:01,859
like 200 000 Subs oh yeah but then you

2228
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,239
go and look at their the actual views

2229
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:05,399
that they get on their videos and it's

2230
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:07,859
like a couple of thousand every video

2231
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:11,519
yeah and so a lot of these channels

2232
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:13,500
don't have real subscribers or if they

2233
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,440
do they're a tiny portion of the numbers

2234
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:19,219
that they claim yeah and from what I've

2235
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:22,619
loved seeing from our data our analytics

2236
01:22:19,219 --> 01:22:25,319
is that our subscriber base is real

2237
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:27,119
because a good portion of people show up

2238
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:29,158
every week

2239
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,738
and so not only have we grown

2240
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:34,379
organically we actually have a proper

2241
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:36,119
regular following and I think that is

2242
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,460
something that you can't

2243
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,039
take for granted you know I don't think

2244
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:43,198
that this I'm not trying to like

2245
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,539
be too self-deprecating or anything but

2246
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,460
you know what we the kinds of

2247
01:22:45,539 --> 01:22:51,479
information that we're interested in

2248
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:53,760
um are very Niche so we may not get or

2249
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:56,819
may not even want to have a hundred

2250
01:22:53,760 --> 01:23:01,079
thousand Subs no but to be able to

2251
01:22:56,819 --> 01:23:03,960
develop a proper close following with

2252
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:06,479
regular people showing up I think that's

2253
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,880
very special in content land I never

2254
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:11,759
thought it would happen for um cannabis

2255
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,100
genetics because it is so Niche it takes

2256
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,500
certain type of personalities to be this

2257
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,840
into learning about what you're smoking

2258
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,000
why it's affecting you the way it does

2259
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,500
and like keeping track like the whole

2260
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,420
provenance of everything and just try to

2261
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,219
get to the bottom that's that's weird

2262
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:28,079
that's super [ __ ] weird there's not a

2263
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:30,239
lot of weirdos like us out there so

2264
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,039
every time that I see like our

2265
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,479
subscriber count growing it tells me

2266
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,939
there's more people that are fascinated

2267
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,039
by this topic and deeply fascinated by

2268
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:40,259
it at that and that it blows my [ __ ]

2269
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:41,819
mind because I I just watching the

2270
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,739
forums over the years you know just a

2271
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:45,359
few hundred people interacting on each

2272
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:47,218
one and that was the best you'd get and

2273
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,559
a lot of them are really mean and

2274
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:51,539
weren't there for good reasons and these

2275
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,699
are all like our our community is

2276
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:56,158
amazing absolutely amazing if I died

2277
01:23:53,698 --> 01:23:57,719
tomorrow it would run itself and that's

2278
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:59,639
what's so [ __ ] cool

2279
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:01,679
I absolutely love it

2280
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,960
I don't I mean I I feel like that's

2281
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,300
possibly an exaggeration I don't I don't

2282
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,119
know if you could die at tomorrow and

2283
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:12,659
this I just run but we'll see I mean no

2284
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:15,179
hopefully we won't see sorry oh my god

2285
01:24:12,658 --> 01:24:17,579
um I'm calling it I'm calling um a hit

2286
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:20,219
on Matt tonight yeah yeah it's good a

2287
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:22,019
thousand-fold show from New Zealand

2288
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:23,520
um live from New Zealand reader

2289
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:26,400
syndicate

2290
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,140
uh what was I gonna say I think okay I

2291
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:30,000
think my paraphrase of what Matt just

2292
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,619
said though is that what makes me happy

2293
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,198
is that there are people who are

2294
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:35,939
interested in finding out the truth or

2295
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:39,059
at least as much of the truth as they

2296
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:40,619
can because that's what we're into yeah

2297
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:42,719
um and it is

2298
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:46,559
it is heartwarming to see

2299
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:48,000
um it is encouraging to see yeah

2300
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,239
um the other side of

2301
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,779
I think uh this ending the season on

2302
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:56,279
this note um you know we we covered

2303
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:57,719
the whole breeding series I think that

2304
01:24:56,279 --> 01:24:59,579
was really fun it was really

2305
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:01,439
comprehensive and I found myself

2306
01:24:59,579 --> 01:25:03,719
actually quite exhausted afterwards and

2307
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:06,000
like not knowing what what kinds what

2308
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:06,899
other episodes we could do yeah

2309
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,779
um

2310
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:12,839
but but in saying that I think Matt and

2311
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:14,698
I have some good ideas for uh the next

2312
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,980
season yes

2313
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:18,539
um we have we're also toying with some

2314
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:19,939
like trying out some new kinds of

2315
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:23,698
content I don't know if it'll actually

2316
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:27,419
come to fruition but like we joked at

2317
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:31,559
least about maybe doing reaction videos

2318
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:34,619
to Strain Hunters or maybe like burners

2319
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,900
like funny documentaries

2320
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:39,238
um maybe maybe we'll see and I'm also

2321
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:40,679
thinking about doing like watching UFO

2322
01:25:39,238 --> 01:25:43,259
videos and getting really [ __ ] up and

2323
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,600
commenting on them as reaction videos

2324
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,460
don't you already kind of do that yeah

2325
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,920
but I don't record it

2326
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,500
I don't like let people watch me do

2327
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,140
stupid [ __ ] and talk over UFO videos so

2328
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:57,238
it might be funny I say stupid [ __ ] when

2329
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:59,159
I'm stoned

2330
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:01,500
but yeah we've definitely also got a few

2331
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:04,738
guests in mind a couple of whom we've

2332
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:07,319
actually like lined up and and uh a few

2333
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:10,619
more uh from we still need to line up

2334
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:13,139
yeah but still plenty more good stuff to

2335
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:15,359
come so you know what I love that this

2336
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:18,600
season thousand fold got to figure out

2337
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:20,519
how hard it is to run the show behind

2338
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,219
the scenes yeah weekly people

2339
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:26,880
communicate and like you know yeah it's

2340
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:28,439
not as easy it sucks it's not and the

2341
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,760
funny thing is that you know I can I

2342
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:31,379
kind of look back on a week and and

2343
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,020
count the hours and be like oh it's not

2344
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:36,179
it's not that much but I think what

2345
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,560
happened why it feels kind of like it it

2346
01:26:36,179 --> 01:26:39,840
stretches throughout the week is because

2347
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,460
yeah the start of the week we we have to

2348
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,400
decide what we're doing yeah then we

2349
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:46,139
have to try to coordinate uh

2350
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,219
like the planning and recording of it

2351
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:49,380
and then of course it actually gets

2352
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:51,300
published later in the week so it's

2353
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:53,880
actually kind of like an endless cycle

2354
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:55,619
and I'm like I think now I'm like now

2355
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,920
that I've seen what I've seen I'm like

2356
01:26:55,619 --> 01:27:00,719
forcing Matt into more and more like

2357
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,760
organization being like no we need to

2358
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,100
start like scheduling things in advance

2359
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,320
I'm Gonna Make a list like a schedule of

2360
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:10,679
episodes that we can cover and

2361
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:13,319
yeah he has no idea he's in I'm the I am

2362
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:16,079
the opposite of schedule and

2363
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:18,779
organization it's gonna be great yeah

2364
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:20,600
it's gonna be great hey it's worked I'll

2365
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:22,920
put it this way Matt's put up with like

2366
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,579
Matt's kind of been really

2367
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,440
um

2368
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:27,359
open to like you know what I've had to

2369
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:30,178
bring so far so I'm hoping oh yeah

2370
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:32,759
that's good [ __ ] I'm stoked I think I

2371
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:34,679
think everybody all the feedback has

2372
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,360
been great for this season people have

2373
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:37,319
really enjoyed the content they've

2374
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:38,939
enjoyed

2375
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:41,158
I think a lot of people have really

2376
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:43,439
enjoyed being able to have some like

2377
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,839
from point A to point B to point C to

2378
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:49,319
point d as opposed to trying to look at

2379
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:51,179
through my ADHD brain because it's

2380
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:54,420
everything that I produce is very

2381
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:57,480
[ __ ] if it's just left up to me to

2382
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:59,460
bring it to be it's it's just how I do

2383
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:01,138
things it's just random thoughts at all

2384
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:03,239
times so I think people really have

2385
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:06,239
enjoyed being able to like follow along

2386
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:07,799
and actually follow along so yeah yeah

2387
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:09,000
looking forward to the next season too

2388

all right I guess that's it

2391
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:18,658

2392
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:20,819

they just dropped and um of course our

2405
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,699
community has really really been built

2406
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,100
through our patreon Discord like

2407
01:28:53,698 --> 01:28:57,899
that's made of family that's made an

2408
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:00,600
absolute family I love some of these

2409
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:02,399
people like there's gonna be a lot of

2410
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,260
lifelong friends built out of that place

2411
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,579
and people really genuinely care about

2412
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,260
each other taking care of each other

2413
01:29:05,579 --> 01:29:09,479
it's insane to see

2414
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,760
um and you can be a part of that

2415
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,439
um for as much as a coffee a month like

2416
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,079
you can be a part of that and chill and

2417
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:18,119
hang out with us and basically it keeps

2418
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:21,238
the trolls out and it's a really awesome

2419
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:22,500
place and yeah do you know roughly how

2420
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:25,138
many

2421
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:27,840
people we have as members on the server

2422
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:30,719
I think it's about 500. I have no at

2423
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,639
least on the Discord but yeah yeah

2424
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,980
probably about that I would guess I know

2425
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,779
it got up to 900 at one point and then

2426
01:29:34,979 --> 01:29:40,198
cleared it out I think that included the

2427
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:44,519
Free People yeah the free people I mean

2428
01:29:40,198 --> 01:29:46,138
yeah you know what I mean they were free

2429
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,400
yeah and occasionally we'll do that

2430
01:29:46,139 --> 01:29:49,020
again we'll open it up for free so

2431
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:50,039
people can get like an idea of what goes

2432
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:52,560
on in there and see if it's something

2433
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:54,539
they're even into you know some people

2434
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,639
are tentative about Discord and chat

2435
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:58,979
rooms and interacting we have a lot of

2436
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,480
people that just kind of you know Snoop

2437
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:01,738
from the background and learn as they go

2438
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,539
and don't interact much and that's

2439
01:30:01,738 --> 01:30:05,099
totally fine too

2440
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:08,279
um and then there's people who get up in

2441
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:11,300
the mix and you know don't shut up you

2442
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:11,300
know it's a great community

2443
