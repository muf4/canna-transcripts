little tiny triangle bags each one and I

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,620

00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,779
I

112
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,879
was so stressed out I was just like

113
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:05,638
getting in a cab was like

114
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:07,439
such a relief yeah oh it was so hard I

115
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,079
get home

116
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,379
and that I was just like oh

117
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,819
passed out that's it oh yeah I had them

118
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,860
now you know what I'm saying I had all

119
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,560
these strains

120
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,660
from the Scentsy seed bank did you worry

121
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,459
that because of your experience there

122
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,900
and the idea that they had that you

123
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,659
might be smuggling heroin that they

124
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:30,299
might be watching your spot after well

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,660
they probably would look in a

126
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,759
me because I had a stamp on like my

127
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:41,460
passport already from uh from Jamaica

128
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,300
oh yeah the whole Jamaica incident

129
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:48,000
yeah okay yeah so that makes sense it

130
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,319
was not fun not not a fun time spending

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,879

355
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,278
and it was like I wasn't

356
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,719
doing it year to year my first time was

357
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,439
actually

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,920
back in the early 80s like 84. oh wow

359
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,040
and my brother-in-law and I

360
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,439
had done some uh small Hindu cushions

361
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,778
that he had in his backyard that was the

362
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,459
first time I had ever been introduced to

363
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,639
growing weed

364
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:52,799
and uh it didn't go well because

365
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,959
somebody robbed it awesome of course

366
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,099
yeah you know

367
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,099

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,019
nothing really took off

371
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,019
and two

372
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,019

in an eight foot long closet

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,099

deep yeah and every day I would move the

408
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:56,119
lights up about a half inch yeah I kept

409

but when I got that first crop and all

414
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:10,619

415
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:13,319

422
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,220
myself I was like wow These are nice

423
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:32,279
even though it was just like bag seed

424
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,558
from sure [ __ ] weed but it was better

425
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:39,240
than what I was getting from the

426
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:41,460
neighborhood yeah so I finally

427
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,980
he also had this little plant is that

428
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,298
the Francine

429
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,099
that little Afghani you remember that

430
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:51,779
little tiny Afghani Gabby

431
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:53,099
hold on a second sure

432
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,859
what's up

433
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:58,259
the Francine was it the go ahead what

434
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,759
what about it the first plant that you

435
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,058
ever brought over to my house you

436
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,900
brought me this cotton this little

437
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,339
Afghani plant

438
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,380
do you remember

439
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't remember what it was I don't

440
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,200
think so your friend Luke yeah I don't

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,240
remember it definitely wasn't that

442
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,740
because I I popped the seed myself

443
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,859
afterwards

444
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,620
okay but that was like that was a cool

445
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:26,339
little plant that he brought over yeah

446
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,538
and it was very Hindu Kush

447
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,879
so

448
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:32,519
we use that

449
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:36,059
and I crossed it but I don't think I

450
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:38,279
crossed it purposely but I got seeds and

451
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:40,319
I used those and I planted those

452
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,058
they didn't come out good I had to toss

453
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,200
them because they're Hermes they're too

454
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,359
much

455
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,840
and then

456
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,839
we were in Washington at the show

457
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,839
and he talks about the bag that we got

458
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:57,359
the seeds from I can't remember who

459
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,339
scored the bag but we did fight over the

460
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,979
seeds

461
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:05,480
is that the RFK yeah we argued over the

462
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,480
seeds and I confiscated them

463
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,759
nope that's been a strained it I've been

464
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,619
researching for a long time because

465
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,019
there's not a lot of info out there

466
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:18,659
about it and I remember the first time I

467
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,000
heard about it was it was supposedly in

468
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,179
this line called DNL and it supposedly

469
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,339
RFK skunk Hawaiian Northern Lights I

470
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,340
don't think that's correct what is it

471
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:35,100
the Hawaiian wouldn't be in there what I

472
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,100
know yeah but

473
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:40,740
somebody who is

474
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:44,339
growing the weed from

475
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,640
um that I got it from yeah it could have

476
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:51,439
been from them yeah I don't know

477
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,440
because there was a sweet version

478
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,019
and there was a version that was very

479
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,140
hashy yeah

480
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,940
okay and had beautiful structure whether

481
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,520
the

482
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,160
the I guess if it was going to call it

483
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,160
Hawaiian more the sativa looking sure

484
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,798
the kind of short and bushy though yeah

485
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,620
it did it didn't go grow really tall

486
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:19,259
like the Hawaiian that I got from the

487
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:20,579
Scentsy seed bank so it has a complete

488
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,440
different structure

489
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,359
when was the last time you were growing

490
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,259
any of the rfks

491
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,259
uh

492
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,200
I would say soon after man I would say

493
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,319
soon after I came back with the uh the

494
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,140
seeds from Amsterdam I discontinued it

495
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,939
yeah I was like this is out of the line

496
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,520
This is a problem these are a problem to

497
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,798
begin with because they hermied ah

498
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:50,099
interesting okay yeah I didn't want him

499
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,720
in the garden and then even in fact when

500
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:53,158
um

501
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,159
it

502
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,919
I was wondering you know like when I got

503
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,659
the the flower originally they had the

504
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,820
little bananas on them you know yeah

505
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:05,580
like you would call them bananas yeah

506
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,619
and uh the pods and so like you kind of

507
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:09,178
knew and then the seeds would air but

508
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,219
you used them because this is what you

509
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,720
had you know sure yeah you weren't going

510
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,200
to be growing males so you used what you

511
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,058
got right yep exactly what's it do you

512
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,298
remember if it you said one was Hashi

513
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:23,599
and was was either really skunky yeah

514
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:27,839
they were they were both

515
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:30,538
skunky definitely for them they were

516
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,158
they were beautiful plants just like I

517
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:34,740
had pictures of them at one time and

518
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,659
then you know you lose things over the

519
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,659
years yeah

520
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:41,640
of course it's hard in the beginning I

521
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,020
was kind of like thrilled and I actually

522
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,340
think

523
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,339
you took the photos

524
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:55,380
you had taken the photos and gave them

525
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,340
and given them to me

526
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:03,240
what were they of of uh the RFK

527
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:05,058
oh yeah I don't have that anymore yeah

528
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,460
snapshots

529
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:10,678
yeah yeah that's too bad

530
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,019
yeah that's it's one of those stories

531
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,820
that I've chased for a long time and uh

532
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,319
I didn't even know it made its way back

533
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:18,000
to you which is really cool that we

534
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,158
finally have some answers on it what it

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,159
was what it was like you know I had

536
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,500
three of them yeah and three of them you

537
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,480
know I have some friends in Virginia

538
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,819
that picked up and they're they're old

539
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,500
school like if you know the the far away

540
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:33,359
from Virginia the cut that was going

541
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,599
around uh East Coast did you familiar

542
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,599
with it

543
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,880
it was pretty popular at least in

544
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,859
Virginia and they were the crew that

545
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,720
popped those seeds and one of their

546
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,759
friends has this old cut of something

547
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,380
they called RFK but it may not even be

548
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,720
the same ones you had you know what I

549
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,340
mean you know it's just funny that we

550
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,019
called it that because we didn't know

551
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:57,019
what to call it and yeah

552
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,600
that's that's what we did yeah

553
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:07,678
let me see I have some other stuff here

554
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,320
written down

555
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,538
okay let's see

556
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,980
um so let's get into some of the diesel

557
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,960
stuff dude

558
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,319
um

559
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:24,620
what was the The Genesis and the reason

560
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,619
for the name of Sour Diesel foreign

561
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:32,640
you know I I really

562
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:36,720
didn't I didn't name it Joe named it

563
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:40,440
okay so like and he's always says it's

564
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,659
because it showered friendships yeah and

565
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,940
it did sell friendships and even the

566
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:49,380
chem talks out with friendships sure

567
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:52,679
okay or even any strain that you will

568
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,940
hold in because the person that you got

569
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,700
it from

570
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,259
say like chem dog right yes like God I

571
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,620
want you to give this out don't give it

572
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:04,440
out so then I'm trying to hold word with

573
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:07,439
this person but this person over here yo

574
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,340

I'm your friend yeah Fred exactly yeah

576
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:16,319
exactly so it's like

577
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:20,099
uh and then after a while you break down

578
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:23,099
anyway oh for sure yeah

579
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:26,099
because it's sour in your friendship

580
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:26,099
right

581
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,740
did you guys call it diesel originally

582
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,440
no I didn't even know what to call it

583
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,839
you just that that's the Albany crew

584
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,640
okay yeah diesel

585
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,740
definitely that's interesting Okay cool

586
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,659
so that's so is that Joe's crew the

587
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:51,359
Albany crew I would guess yeah him Bondo

588
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:54,120
Maxwell that's right you know

589
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,399
yeah I remember Mac those guys those

590
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,459
guys were a lot of it was a lot of fun

591
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,419
in the day it really yeah

592
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,819
I think did you tell me Matt that Bondo

593
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,500
was taking credit for it well vondo had

594
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:10,139
said that the bag

595
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,079
um didn't say sour on it it said our

596
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,600
diesel on it and someone wrote an s on

597
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,339
it as a joke and it became Sour Diesel

598
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,278
after that joke

599
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:22,558
that could be true yeah yeah I have no

600
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:26,819
clue you know what I'm saying yeah that

601
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:28,440
could be true and uh you know but

602
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:30,359
you know

603
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,940
and that's his again that's his

604
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,558
perspective yeah right his memory

605
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,480
perspective that's how it works and

606
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,700
that's what we're learning

607
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,099
and it was

608
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,819
the only reason it worked is because we

609
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:47,579
were all there at the same time exactly

610
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,079
you know um why was there this is a good

611
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,460
question this is one that's that's

612
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,038
really

613
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,519
puzzled me for a while early on there

614
00:26:53,038 --> 00:27:00,480
was confusion that uh the sour or the

615
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:04,019
diesel rather was a chem 91 clone

616
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,339
exactly just the cam 91 cut renamed and

617
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:08,819
then there was confusion that it might

618
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:13,259
be a chem 91 S1 backseat pure chem 91

619
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:16,200
and later on it became more of a super

620
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,640
skunk hybrid which do you think seemed

621
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,440
more accurate to you from your

622
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,820
perspective because I don't want you to

623
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,000
feel like you're held down to saying it

624
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,000
is

625
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,879
so so

626
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,500
early on people I don't even know if

627
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,140
it's early early on in my experience

628
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:38,640
when I came into the scene around 2006

629
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:43,259
2008 in that region people were saying

630
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:46,860
that diesel was a chem 91 Club Okay so

631
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:50,179
stop right there so 2006.

632
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:54,479
okay I'm already out of the picture

633
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:57,240
I'm added a picture two years okay

634
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,778
so what people were doing

635
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,558
I don't know yeah because I didn't even

636
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:08,599
dabble because I was crazy

637
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:08,599
yeah all right so now

638
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:16,140
too old

639
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,659
oh [ __ ] sorry 209 is okay I'm free yeah

640
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,480
I can do what I want now I'm starting to

641
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,820
come back and do my a little bit of

642
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,558
outdoor now I can only do alcohol and

643
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,298
that's it

644
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,000
because I don't have the spot indoors

645
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:34,859
and my light is completely changed at

646
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,440
this at this scene at this time I am now

647
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,418
working

648
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,058
doing back what I used to do before I

649
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:44,059
started growing yeah so

650
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,179
I have got a whole new career

651
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,980
and

652
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:55,740
now it's 2 13 is really when I can do

653
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,839
what I want to do outdoors I start my

654
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,480
freedom program all over

655
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,278
yeah from scratch I get a cut of the

656
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,700
sour

657
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:08,579
I get uh

658
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:13,019
some genetics from um

689
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,278
a passion you know like

690
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:32,460
at this point in my life I'm not looking

691
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:36,179
to go into business in it I see you all

692
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,340
the regulations the hurdles yeah the

693
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,038
money the money to get in even though I

694
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:43,379
could get a license probably because

695
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:45,419
they they lock they you know I I did

696
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,740
changed my whole life over it it got

697
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,419
lost

698
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,099
yeah you know

699
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,020
and that and that's the worst feeling

700
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,480
too again is when they when they come to

701
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:57,740
your house and you're like

702
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,419
[ __ ] is that your grow room yeah I bet

703
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,940
yeah that's mine

704
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:04,980
you know all right that's why I

705
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,380
understand like why a lot of the the

706
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,298
people that that came before me

707
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,460
took the choice to go the corporate

708
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:13,019
route because a lot of them had PTSD

709
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,360
from being hit and they didn't want to

710
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,519
be hit anymore and they wanted some kind

711
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,099
of safety and to do their passion you

712
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,898
know what I mean exactly exactly like I

713
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:24,778
I do have like

714
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:26,239
if I have to go back to a closet or a

715
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:29,759
tent yeah

716
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,380
I'd do it you know yeah right

717
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,179

756
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,099
an annuity

757
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:06,538
and I and I hope the company that you're

758
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:09,240
working for

759
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:12,298
growing weed is is doing the same thing

760
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,919
for you you know yeah it's gonna be it's

761
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:17,339
a hard thing because there's profit

762
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,340
there but it's like fine line profit yep

763
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:22,740
it's like the state's taxing you

764
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:24,298
how much of that percentage of that you

765
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,179
know and yeah

766
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:29,700
and then I even said that like a couple

767
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:32,580
years ago I said every state that comes

768
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,200
online the price of the product comes

769
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:37,019
down yep

770
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,140
that's like two years ago I said weed's

771
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:43,740
going to be 150 bucks an ounce

772
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:46,919
yeah it's way less yeah especially in

773
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,480
Cali it's horrible it's it's because you

774
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,259
have so many grows

775
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,599
so you need such a large scale to grow

776
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:57,359
you know yep and and then the state's

777
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,639
taking the tax on it you know and the

778
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,199
people rather not pay the tax they're

779
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,220
still going to go to the Underground

780
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,819
Market

781
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,200
and get usually just as good a product

782
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:09,239
or better

783
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,878
yeah and then that floods the The

784
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,118
Underground Market and uh all the prices

785
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,098
drop there yeah but some people seem to

786
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,740
like the city

787
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:21,838
some people for some reason

788
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:24,118
I still think that they can charge 400

789
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,039
bucks an ounce I don't get it uh it's

790
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,820
like

791
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:31,679
wild that only lasts so long uh it still

792
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,460
lasted and I'm still looking and I'm

793
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,159
like

794
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,898
yeah yeah it's going to be a lot of mad

795
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,500
people feeling custied when they realize

796
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:42,179
you can get a lot of Rich clientele yeah

797
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,639
so

798
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,079
the businessman who goes to the to that

799
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,320
business man

800
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,539
uh you know they don't care they just

801
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,879
like yeah here here I would know that

802
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:56,460
well nothing about rich clientele let me

803
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:59,639
tell you I've never had

804
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,099

00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,019
seats

828
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:09,059
I just picked the first mail

829
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:11,338
yeah I was like all right that well I

830
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:12,960
know I I was reading the book and I was

831
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:14,940
like all right I don't want them too

832
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,199
tall I don't want them too short I take

833
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,280
the middle height

834
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,500
right

835
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,660
an early flowering I was like oh yeah

836
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,139
okay that's what it says in a book I

837
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:24,139
take that

838
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,500
I get rid of the other males there's the

839
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,659
only and that's the only

840
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,460
I was doing other strains too but I took

841
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,219
the northern lights and I crossed it

842
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,539
into the camp yeah

843
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:39,179
now

844
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:42,599
I used to call that chem lights

845
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:45,000
yeah I've heard that term okay good chem

846
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,059
times lights yeah it makes sense old

847
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,519
school naming and

848
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:51,719
um but it would actually be first would

849
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:53,400
be

850
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:56,098
right this isn't the mail supposed to

851
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,720
come first it comes second in their name

852
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,380
all right so Kevin lice then I did name

853
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:04,019
it right yep yep so I took that and then

854
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,720
I grew

855
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:09,358
100 seeds out

856
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,159
and um

857
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,159
with my friend Keith

858
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:19,199
yeah and the bro

859
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:21,319
no no different Keys No

860
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:25,858
wow that dude's taking a lot of credit

861
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,960
no no different teeth no

862
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:29,838
no

863
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,480
that's that's that's

864
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:36,539
gate Gabe introduced me to him okay

865
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,900
introduced me and that's the keys is

866
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:41,279
from Staten Island

867
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,619
can I interject something real here soon

868
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,640
do it please I've been busy at the Apple

869
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:49,440
Store I can tell yeah sorry it's okay

870
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,319
but I wanted to make sure this happened

871
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,720
but so they call me Staten Island yeah

872
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,820
and what I told them is that you should

873
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:00,139
be called Staten Island because you

874
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,880
lived there before me and after me yeah

875
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:04,739
all right I gotta put you back on me all

876
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,019
right so

877
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,459
um so Keith this is a different key so I

878
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,838
want to establish that so people know

879
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,159
okay

880
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:16,578
and uh so he's renting the hell up on

881
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,578
like

882
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,200
Toad Hill area Grimes hill whatever

883
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:25,619
and uh

884
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:28,559
we go we go and we set up a room

885
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:30,720
we put in we pop 100 seeds out of 100

886
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,599
seats

887
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,159
I go uh this this one right here I like

888
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,039
to see the best it's the most beautiful

889
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,539
seed yeah I said this is the number one

890
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,279
we were numbering everything one through

891
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:43,380
Ohio yeah we don't know [ __ ] about

892
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,099
names yet you know yeah yeah we just

893
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,099
started like all right

894
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,179
you gotta write something on the tag

895
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:54,838
yeah exactly so out of the hundred seeds

896
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:57,000
I remember we got 33 females okay not

897
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:59,299
bad I was like all right that makes

898
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,300
sense yeah

899
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:03,900
animals

900
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,480
100 seats

901
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,760
well 33 females we should say and we

902
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,760
didn't keep any males got rid of

903
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:18,900
there was such a diversity like a lot of

904
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,900
them or

905
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:26,699
Northern Lights looking

906
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,920
other things so when Gabby and not so

907
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:31,259
dog was searching for like things that

908
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,700
looked like the chem yeah I can

909
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,339
understand what they were saying and

910
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:36,838
reflect on that I was like interesting

911
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,239
but

912
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:43,619
out of the 33

913
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:46,078
11 um 11 of them and

914
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:49,380
light traits

915
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,800
yeah okay

916
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:57,000
but that first seed that I planted the

917
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,380
number one became the underdog Oh either

918
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,219
one

919
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:06,000
that was the most chem-like but it also

920
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:08,699
like it had chem structure

921
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:15,019
but it had something about it like it

922
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:15,019
was a little bit spicy it was nice yeah

923
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:19,880
it had maybe a little bit more Northern

924
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,079
Lights in it or something

925
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,599
and that was around

926
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,680
around

927
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,240
until I got in trouble now and what year

928
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,039
was that that it would have been not

929
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,358
around 204

930
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,519
gotcha

931
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:38,219
so

932
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,280
not too many people were doing it I had

933
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:43,799
one friend up on the mountain doing it

934
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,940
who gave it to somebody who took it to

935
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,560
Colorado

936
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,559
oh okay yeah okay

937
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,119
from there it could have got spread out

938
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,039
sure and whatever

939
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,140
people said they had problems with it

940
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:00,659
they couldn't keep it going

941
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:03,299
okay the camera's hard too when you try

942
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:05,399
yeah yeah it's super hard you know you

943
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,800
got to have the right temperature root

944
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,519
zoned absolutely

945
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,119
um

946
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,119
so

947
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:17,338
to me that the the underdog you know

948
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:20,579
people cross it in with the shower but

949
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:22,019
it's not that hard like so I I A friend

950
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:25,440
of mine

951
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:27,659
gave me a cut 10 years ago when I moved

952
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,220
here and I've been that's the cut that

953
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:31,920
I'm working off in the colon I call

954
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:34,259
Underdog Northern Lights or

955
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,240
but when you back breed it

956
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,339
uh

957
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,338
the Northern Lights does come out it's

958
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:43,679
and it's uh it's dominant in it sure all

959
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:45,838
right but that's why like now I have to

960
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,819
come back and I'm gonna cross the cam

961
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,619
back into it this year

962
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,838
so the cut that you got back recently

963
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:55,280
which one is that or not recently the

964
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:58,320
91. I have okay awesome awesome

965
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,480
you know I had to sell hey Mike just

966
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,480
just so you know Mike we can get you the

967
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,119
the original dog back

968
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,760
if you want that the what

969
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,400
the chem dog not the 91.

970
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,880
that is the 91. 10 bucks excuse me I

971
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,460
thought you were saying MD I'm confused

972
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,480
yeah

973
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,579
what's your what's your opinion on Kim

974
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,000
do you and like in your theories on that

975
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:27,440
okay so here's my theory on the chem D

976
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,679
chemd has mutations in it yep right

977
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,838
destroy it yeah okay I'm serious like

978
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,338
why you keep a plan around that has

979
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,980
problems

980
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:39,900
every time I have a plant that there's

981
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:44,420
something genetically wrong with the

982
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:47,639
plant I eliminate it yeah why are you

983
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,200
destroying the gene pool I'm a purist in

984
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,159
that way you know yeah yeah I know it's

985
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:56,159
fair like I'm sorry it's it

986
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:58,940
euthanize it okay yeah okay it produces

987
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,559
nice body though all right yeah but

988
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:04,019
don't use it for breeding

989
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,599
yeah so if you're not going to use it

990
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:08,519
for breeding then you can

991
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,700
what I

992
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,500
that's my but nobody's gonna destroy it

993
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:14,759
take it keep it around yeah right you

994
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,920
know I'm the same way with certain

995
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,140
traits too where it's like my OCD is

996
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,880
just so zeroed in on something like I

997
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:23,338
won't pop backseat if I don't know

998
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,559
what's in it and I I won't even if it's

999
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:27,059
the most dank thing ever I won't pop it

1000
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,000
because my brain can't deal with not

1001
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:33,239
knowing oh yeah it's weird that's my

1002
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,639
thing I'll if I didn't know a seed I'll

1003
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:39,000
pop it because if I have room for it

1004
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:42,118
yeah you know because I make seeds and

1005
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,818
I can't even pop them all yeah people

1006
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,338
give me seeds and I'm like what the [ __ ]

1007
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:48,900
am I gonna do with these seeds yeah I

1008
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:51,358
don't want to I don't want to be an

1009
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,039
[ __ ] but I accept it and you know

1010
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,500
what anybody who's listening to this to

1011
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,139
this it's not that I'm trying to like

1012
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:01,260
think I'm a snob or anything but only of

1013
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:03,659
course so many seeds I can do a year and

1014
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,760
imagine I'm actually really looking for

1015
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:10,199
the good male like you guys talked about

1016
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,780
feminizing using feminis and knowing

1017
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:15,299
I just like you to do the pollination

1018
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,920
okay I like males I prefer males

1019
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,560
personally even though I make them

1020
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,920
spraying stuff I like the thing is with

1021
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,960
males it's it's people okay anybody can

1022
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,559
make seeds using a male we all get that

1023
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,240
but getting a mail using it and being

1024
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,519
able to predict what he's going to do

1025
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,500
and working with him enough to be able

1026
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:36,059
to do that that's that's a skill and a

1027
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,519
talent and it's much different than just

1028
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:40,739
using pollen so the seeds that I have

1029
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,559
now like a lot I had

1030
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:46,259
most of them are very stable like yeah I

1031
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,940
know what I'm gonna get when I pop this

1032
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,560
one Northern Lights which got some

1033
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,119
Durbin in it

1034
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,880
and the sour

1035
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,039
I'm like I know exactly what I get I

1036
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,780
look at it from Yeti I could grow 10 20

1037
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,358
of them and get the same exact thing

1038
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:03,119
yeah exactly

1039
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:05,578
I I like and I have jars of it I'm like

1040
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,838
I'm not growing that this year yeah but

1041
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,460
you know what you're gonna you knew what

1042

1043
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,838
don't want you yeah

1044
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,640
but it's nice and and I like it when I

1045
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,259
come home from work that's the first

1046
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,559
thing I usually hit and then later I do

1047
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,800
the dog or the sour yeah have you ever

1048

really cool

1068
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:13,618
yeah it is cool but it's like you have

1069
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:16,799
you have to be careful yeah

1070
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:18,000
because it can lead to problems sure and

1071
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,119
you don't want problems for your kids

1072
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,099
obviously

1073
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:26,180
one second go ahead

1074
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,180
uh in a little while

1075
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,000
okay in a little bit

1076
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,099
I'm sorry you have to edit that no

1077
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
worries no worries I got it I read it

1078
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,039
down

1079
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,679
two

1080
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:43,259
46 36 all right we're good all right so

1081
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:47,219
where where are we at I'm sorry

1082
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:49,339
um let's see uh

1083
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,078
we've talked about male breeding

1084
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:53,519
selecting males and oh the reason I

1085
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,900
offered the blueberry sour it's just

1086
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,940
it's one of those things where

1087
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,639
blueberries some people love it or hate

1088
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,099
it but if you get the right one with the

1089
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:05,219
super blueberry blueberry jam like

1090
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:07,800
strong scent and taste and it's also

1091
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:09,480
very medicinal there's something to that

1092
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,099
immersing quality that comes with it

1093
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,338
that's real special and we found that in

1094
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,660
the Blue Sour a bunch so yeah you know

1095
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:17,578
like I I have the same problem people

1096
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:19,379
give me seeds and I'm like I'm not gonna

1097
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:22,079
be able to ever pop these why I think no

1098
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,700
I know but you are welcome to those and

1099
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,140
you can store them forever if you want

1100
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:27,719
but you're welcome everything goes in

1101
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:29,940
the freezer now yeah yeah it's like I've

1102
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,219
learned and you know I think I

1103
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,619
I don't know a while back I wanted to

1104
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:36,779
try this root hormone thing that you

1105
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,400
were talking about or something yeah I

1106
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,920
never heard back from you or root

1107
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,660
popping starting seed starting thing it

1108
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,599
was like the way to take the shell off

1109
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:47,338
the seed or something oh maybe maybe I

1110
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,660
mean I do it manually when I do it like

1111
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:54,358
that but there's also gibralic acid yeah

1112
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:56,098
I have still some like really like 30

1113
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:59,818
something year old seats and I'm like

1114
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:02,460
yeah that's like a tissue culture level

1115
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:04,079
yeah that's that's tissue I wouldn't

1116
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,740
even play with it that's tissue cultural

1117
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,440
level I tried with so many of the like

1118
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:14,159
this the sour Northern Lights that I had

1119
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:18,480
I bet over it and nothing ever came with

1120
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:20,940
of them at all brutal brutal and I would

1121
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,400
do like four at a time and pray and I'd

1122
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:26,818
start try different things I took

1123
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,818
sandpaper took the yeah soaked them

1124
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:32,179
overnight did a peroxide wash whatever

1125
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:32,179
yeah

1126
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,859
tried distilled water

1127
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,780
yeah dude trying to keep it Sterling

1128
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:42,420
yeah it's so hard sometimes they just

1129
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,579
don't have that energy to go anymore oh

1130
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,780
some of them put out a little tap and

1131
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:47,640
that was it

1132
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,579
if you can get it to do that then that

1133
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,858
means gabrelic acid might work yeah well

1134
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:56,099
that was now a couple years ago but yeah

1135
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:58,380
dude it's been in the freezer yeah that

1136
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,300
see that's that's a big help dude yeah

1137
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:04,019
that's they might still have that Vigor

1138
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:07,680
just a little bit like four left oh man

1139
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:10,019
oh brutal brutal but that's that's

1140
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:13,259
that's a seed life dude that's a

1141
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:15,559
seedsman's life but I think I still have

1142
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:20,280
to like a jar

1143
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:22,219
of uh like a spice Jar full of uh NL

1144
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,300
times five from an original

1145
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:27,539
Scentsy first cross

1146
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,560
so when you can get those to come oh

1147
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,358
yeah

1148
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,219
you know and if it you know but the

1149
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:35,338
first few years they weren't in the

1150
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,838
freezer and that's the problem yeah you

1151
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:38,099
know when you say you use Northern

1152
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:40,078
Lights which do you remember which

1153
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:43,619
Northern Lights you used as the mail was

1154
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,560
it one two two by five five by two I

1155
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:50,760
think it was number five right

1156
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:53,759
you mean to cross into the camp yes the

1157
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:57,240
one that we bought no something no no it

1158
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:01,440
was NL time uh

1159
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:04,559
you know five or one no no no one I

1160
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,079
believe because the NL times five that

1161
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,900
was tall giant plant

1162
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,000
okay that makes sense

1163
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,599
the no5 was all over the place it's like

1164
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,119
a Afghani Hawaiian Afghani yeah it's

1165
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,599
really tall I used to get like two liter

1166
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:24,599
soda bottles off it yeah buns okay Airy

1167
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,280
yeah 90 days I was like [ __ ] that plan

1168
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,400
but they're in there

1169
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:32,760
beaded jar of seeds and actually

1170
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,160
I've read the chem lights into it so

1171
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,020
yeah it could be better maybe that oh I

1172
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,098
bet

1173
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:40,099
never did anything with the seats

1174
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:47,279
we have a um

1175
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:50,700
nl5 from the the Northern Lights crew

1176
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,660
Seattle Grand and if you ever want to

1177
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:53,279
run through those you're more than

1178
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:57,440
welcome it's just an open pollination of

1179
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:02,160
the originals but but the NL that I use

1180
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,700
like it had just like spicy aroma

1181
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:08,818
do it and it was it was a short plan it

1182
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:12,078
only grew just like it said 100

1183
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:15,318
centimeters interesting yeah

1184
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,318
four foot

1185
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:21,838
three foot wide it was like all right

1186
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:24,419
dank whole [ __ ] like if you had a

1187
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:26,039
roll of coins in your hand yeah the

1188
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,039
blood was like the weight of a roll of

1189
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:29,759
coins like it sounds like an L1 yeah

1190
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:30,838
yeah

1191
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,200
like

1192
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:36,679
a bud like this big like in it for a

1193
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:41,519
small mason jar would give me nine grams

1194
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:41,519
Jesus yeah yeah

1195
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:51,179
please do yeah

1196
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:53,759
weasel here but he had nothing nothing

1197
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:55,919
to talk about he's like yeah he's like

1198
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,240
this is gonna be really short like 15-20

1199
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,818
minutes like I don't know what I'm gonna

1200
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,979
say it's like an hour and a half out I

1201
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:03,679
think we're an hour and a half later and

1202
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,480
this guy

1203
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,759
okay he hasn't even begun to tell you

1204
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,639
all the stories he can tell oh I think

1205
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,380
that's gonna be this is gonna be like a

1206
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,818
multi-episode I hope so we're gonna

1207
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,980
we're gonna have to record at least

1208
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:20,759
three more to get like

1209
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,740
you know anywhere near what what needs

1210
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,260

00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:22,078
here waiting for a minute I want to make

1281
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:23,460
sure that in this map in this podcast I

1282
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,579
said it in other ones I wanted to say in

1283
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:29,940
this podcast that flop here was the

1284
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:34,079
first person that I ever saw grow indoor

1285
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:36,539
yeah and when he did that I stopped

1286
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,359
being a gypsy that was time for me to

1287
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:42,960
like get a place and be more like clock

1288
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:44,519
yeah right so you know like I might have

1289
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,679
you know given him a little bit of

1290
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:49,619
inspiration by showing him some some

1291
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:51,899
into a flower but you know he really he

1292
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:54,059
inspired me to go get an apartment you

1293
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,500
know right I mean you know what happened

1294
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,760
with me that's why he's such a critical

1295
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,219
part of the story

1296
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,880
yeah yeah you know

1297
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:05,539
I went to reverse I met him and I winded

1298
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,539
up going on tour

1299
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,059
yeah let's go let's go on tour that's

1300
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:20,338
awesome though yeah

1301
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:22,500
let's see what we've got

1302
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:25,199
um as far as genetics questions like

1303
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,659
we've touched on um

1304
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:29,159
well I don't need it the headband you I

1305
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:31,399
don't think we covered headband or what

1306
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:35,338
your your theory was on that opinions

1307
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:38,220
I'm not sure because did somebody

1308
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:42,119
take a strain

1309
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:43,318
and rename it or did they pop a seat

1310
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:45,599
yeah yeah

1311
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:47,159
okay so that wasn't from your you know

1312
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,160

because I'm the shops do it yeah you

1356
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:56,219
kind of can yeah I can't I can't I can't

1357
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:56,220
take a gift I can't keep [ __ ] absolutely

1358
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,838
so

1359
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,539
I come home yep first thing

1360
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:06,779
yeah you know dinner time first thing

1361
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:08,239
after four bed okay what do I get three

1362
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,859
joints at the most

1363
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:13,798
you know you know why I started smoking

1364
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:17,338
a lot as I got older once I hit about 30

1365
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:19,920
I say older once I hit 35 right once I

1366
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:22,558
hit 35 my whole like my inner hormones

1367
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,019
my brain chemistry changed yeah and

1368
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,079
everything seemed too strong

1369
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:30,298
everything and I was getting paranoia

1370
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,460
every time so the right the way I had to

1371
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:35,219
beat it was to constantly smoke and then

1372
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:38,039
I never got paranoia again but I also

1373
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:40,798
was the downside was I lost a lot of my

1374
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:41,759
ability to feel different highs you know

1375
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,480
right

1376
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,299
yeah right it's a give and take if you

1377
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,818
smoke constantly all day long do you get

1378
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:55,159
high no no it just barely takes the edge

1379
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:55,159
off no that's it so

1380
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:02,399
waiting from the when I come home

1381
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,078
to smoke is that's when I get high but

1382
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,980
then now I gotta watch it then I don't

1383
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:11,039
get too high yeah I'm gonna greet two

1384
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:13,500
young men in about a half hour oh yeah

1385
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,900
right so yeah

1386
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,659
yeah

1387
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:21,960
and I don't want to be you know set that

1388
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:23,699
