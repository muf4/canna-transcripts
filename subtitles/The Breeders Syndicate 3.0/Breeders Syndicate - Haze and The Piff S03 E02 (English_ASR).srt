episode

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,320
it's pretty professional there's all

41
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,000
kinds of cards in here that just that

42
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,438
describe everything it tells you how to

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
go through it

44
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,279
uh lots of tips and tricks

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,599
cool

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,399
what's interesting about it is like they

47
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,599
uh

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,239
you know they have those kind of things

49
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,840
for perfumes and like yeah i had some

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,759
friends that were studying because i

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
live in wine country right like studying

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,318
to be sommeliers yeah and in order to do

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,680
that back then like this is like 18

54
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,159
years ago or something they would buy

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,200
these like thousand dollar kits

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,560
yeah and the aromas were there to teach

57
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,560
them

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,959
like what an advanced taster was tasting

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,800
or smelling when they like you know were

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,479
talking about merlot or whatever and

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
they were talking about woodsy notes

62
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,878
with hints of raspberry and all that

63
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,479
they had to be able to like learn the

64
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,159
language

65
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,679
and so they had like a whole book and

66
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,159
all these scents and all this different

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
stuff and so for terpenes with weed it's

68
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,680
like

69
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,598
teaching people how to talk about smell

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,360
yeah that's a big hug

71
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,079
it's a big thing if you can if you can

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,480
do it too and it's probably like most

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,599
breeders and weed nerds biggest

74
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,598
weak weak area yeah i know it is for me

75
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,079
i'm not i'm not a terp expert by any

76
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,318
stretch of the imagination no definitely

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
not neither am i you know and neither

78
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,479
are a lot of our friends

79
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,639
yeah

80
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,840
you know so i mean there's an aspect

81
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,279
where it's like

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,878
it's just you just lack the language

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,479
because you don't encounter how to talk

84
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,120
about that language

85
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,518
anywhere yeah really

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,920
terpenes and like wine sommeliers it's

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,360
all about using your eyebrows

88
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,000
and like

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,120
and your eyes to express um

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
yeah you know i mean it it uh

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,158
it's and then it's okay and then it's

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
all relative to that human being's

93
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,280
ability to taste

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
yeah

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
i have i have a really bad sense of

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
smell

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,480
so my taste is really off too you know

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,039
like the whole the whole shebang sucks

99
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,399
up upstairs here in this region right

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,639
yeah the whole

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,039
everything everything in this region is

102
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,119
sucking

103
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,719
we're slowly climbing up there

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
yeah yeah it's weird when i have to do

105
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,919
it on this [ __ ] account like most

106
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,878
people don't know to follow it even

107
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,798
though i said it so hopefully still

108
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,079
shadow band or whatever on the other one

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,438
from doing live

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,200
i checked it this morning and it was

111
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,918
like nope you cannot do lives oh man

112
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,680
yeah well it is what it is

113
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,359
it is what it is i'm used to it by now

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,360
but yeah no people should we're gonna do

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
a whole episode i'm not exactly sure

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
when but we're gonna have our our buddy

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,079
crybaby on and he

118
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,198
has a lot of knowledge and language

119
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,120
around aromas terpenes sense

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,840
what causes smells what are the

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
components of it and uh he'll be able to

122
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,799
speak a lot more intelligently than

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,520
either matt or i can uh yeah i think you

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,560
know

125
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,319
so uh that'll be soon i hope

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,639
he was the one that was uh first telling

127
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,199
me to stop calling skunky [ __ ] terps i

128
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,879
was like oops yeah they're like theols

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
and like yeah but what's interesting

130
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,719
about that is even like the uh and we're

131
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,960
like rambling for a while waiting for

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
people to show up but even

133
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,319
what's interesting about you know the

134
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
thing about theolos and stuff is how

135
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,319
they're volatile

136
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,079
yeah right where terpenes are longer

137
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,240
lasting and i would always notice about

138
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,839
the old super skunk that i had

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,519
that the last two or three weeks before

140
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,758
harvest and the first month after

141
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,000
cutting it it was just rank

142
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,840
yeah but if you kept it long enough even

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,279
if and you know in a nice jar in the

144
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,839
dark or whatever it would eventually

145
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,519
just kind of turn into generic green bud

146
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,439
did you find that the more it kept its

147
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,038
moisture content the longer it lasted in

148
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,959
the morning as it evaporated yeah

149
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,959
certainly and it was actually kind of

150
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,359
tough because it was one of those nugs

151
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,839
that you were like it was famous for

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,680
like looking dense but weighing light

153
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,758
yeah yeah you put this thing that you

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
think was like a huge nug and you're

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,199
like oh man this thing's massive and

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,038
it's like 2.8 grams yeah you know

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,360
it had like but it had really good like

158
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,439
air to air to bud ratio so it burned

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,240
really well yeah cherry ink is very

160
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,719
similar you can use snappers of it uh

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,038
some bud like like cushes especially and

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
a lot of this cookie [ __ ] um you really

163
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,478
have to cure it right to get it to burn

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,560
well yeah

165
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,560
you know um but but

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,079
uh you know super skunk you could burn

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,519
that like pretty quick

168
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,879
because it just had like a good amount

169
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,959
of air

170
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,120
it sounds like denali saved that cut

171
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,359
from uh panda

172
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,319
oh that's good yeah i'm real stoked

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,280
about that

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
so we're up over it we're 100 and 810

175
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,000
people maybe we could start chatting

176
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,519
yeah do you want to answer a few

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
questions first then maybe it'll get up

178
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,959
higher a little bit yeah i haven't even

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
[ __ ] looked to be honest i've just

180
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,758
been bullshitting

181
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,399
um someone just asked about mango haze i

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,439
could talk about mango haze there you go

183
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,638
mango

184
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,519
mango haze is like a super nice um

185
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,038
line from shanti baba and neville

186
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:56,478
it's uh nl5 haze by skunk haze it's a

187
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:59,120
sister to super silver haze and it uses

188
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:02,079
this famous cut called the 122 or the

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,000
mango which is like my favorite nl5 haze

190
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,839
cut and it's still alive over there i

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,038
think it's still shoulden coffee shops

192
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,519
and uh johnsy has it apparently

193
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,680
um yeah but yeah it's it's a little bit

194
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,879
more hazy it's a little it's a little

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
like it's got a little bit more of the

196
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,038
flavors that i like it's got less

197
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,959
terpenoline than super silver haze it

198
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,839
doesn't tend to yield as much

199
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,638
um

200
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,279
but uh but it's a super nice plant and i

201
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,439
think it's likely one of the ones where

202
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,918
he still has the right parents

203
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,240
yeah i can't say for nobody can say for

204
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,399
sure but i think people still find

205
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,519
really nice plants in that line yeah

206
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,120
they do

207
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,519
and it's not just a there is a clone

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,038
only mango haze too i believe i don't

209
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,198
know if it's from the same seed line but

210
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,199
i know miami mango has that one and it's

211
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,280
it's like a trapinoline and mango it's

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
it's it's one of my favorites it's like

213
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,959
uh i've seen some tests on it and it's

214
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,279
terpene content it's pretty off the

215
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,959
charts yeah pretty high

216
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,439
um and uh yeah so that's mango haze it's

217
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,038
kind of mango haze and super silver and

218
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,439
neville's haze are kind of like the

219
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,918
final three hazes that came out

220
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,959
yeah at the end of like one whole era

221
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,560
you know

222
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,758
so that's starting at the end not the

223
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
beginning

224
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,080
but um

225
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,079
you know uh let's see

226
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
skunk haze a lot of people in europe

227
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,279
don't like the skunk cases quite as much

228
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,478
because they felt the skunk

229
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,758
aspects kind of overpowered the

230
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,519
um the haze like the more delicate haze

231
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,719
aspects that they liked

232
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,200
that's why they were always kind of

233
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,080
looking for like bland indicas to cross

234
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,120
it to

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
yeah

236
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,038
to allow you know they kind of wanted

237
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
like very little terp

238
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,639
cuts

239
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
to blend it too to see if the haze terps

240
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,360
would come through

241
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,879
so

242
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
um

243
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,919
anyway i don't know uh we're gonna we're

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,160
gonna chat about haze tonight which is a

245
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,879
super controversial subject

246
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,879
so

247
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,600
a disclaimer this is just kind of like

248
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,720
our opinion on it and like what we see

249
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
um

250
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
in the forum days when things got

251
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,240
started some of the longest running

252
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,000
threads ever

253
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,799
were arguments between all these old

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,120
timers over haze

255
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,879
um on cannabis world on overgrow

256
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,480
probably on icmag

257
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,720
um it would just go sometimes it would

258
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,639
go into the hundreds of pages yeah of

259
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
people battling back and forth over what

260
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,720
was the real haze story

261
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,278
one of my one of my good friends over on

262
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
mr nice did probably what i think was

263
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,759
the

264
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
best

265
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
uh

266
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,519
treatise on haze like overview on haze

267
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,959
during that time before any anybody else

268
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
had really been able to track down

269
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,278
anyone to talk to it was my friend

270
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
bigger or

271
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,240
um off mr nice i see there's someone

272
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,759
with that name in here but i don't think

273
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,120
it's the same dude it would be awesome

274
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,278
if i remember him on mr nice for sure

275
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,440
herb was a cool dude um i haven't seen

276
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,720
him in a long time though

277
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
so i don't know if he's still hanging

278
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,000
around or what the deal is but he if you

279
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
i think it's still up on mr nice and for

280
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
the most part i know it's been

281
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,839
considered one of the more accurate

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,440
histories on it

283
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
but there was some stuff we dug up in

284
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
the past few years i know bodhi found a

285
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,759
book

286
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,399
about santa cruz or written in santa

287
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,078
cruz and santa cruz history and it

288
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
actually mentions a few of them by name

289
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,159
and it's one of the first things we

290
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,560
found where there were other names in it

291
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,039
you know full names

292
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,439
i mean so there's an aspect where

293
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,759
like uh you know hayes has a history

294
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,800
dating back to like the late 60s early

295
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,200
70s yeah so it's hard enough to decipher

296
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,240
stuff that happened 15 or 20 years ago

297
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,120
uh much less 40. um so there's a lot of

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,519
uh

299
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,078
forgive me hazy stuff around the origins

300
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,639
of it and on those threads there's tons

301
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,078
of arguing that's gone on yeah there's

302
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,399
tons of arguing

303
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,799
um and there's you know uh

304
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,159
sam skunk man has his version

305
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,759
you know he's posted under different

306
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,399
names about things he claims to have

307
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,319
been

308
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,720
a neighbor to those guys

309
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,360
um but i think what's fairly well

310
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
accepted is it started out as colombian

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,159
by colombia

312
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
yeah

313
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,519
i think we could start there it was

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
colombian by colombian from import weed

315
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,159
and they grew it in greenhouses in santa

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,679
cruz and areas that were mild like that

317
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,958
because you needed those mild

318
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,278
temperatures

319
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,879
in order to take it till december or

320
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,200
january or whatever the hell it was that

321
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,720
they pulled it down yeah um they hadn't

322
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,879
figured out depths or anything like that

323
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
yet and so it got pretty famous

324
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,439
um i know matt has a poster somewhere of

325
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
it um it got

326
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
early on got named and got kind of

327
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,278
legendary

328
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,360
um you know it was sold high-end in new

329
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,320
york i believe

330
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,879
um

331
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,720
for you know uh quite a bit at the time

332
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,240
yeah it was considered like the super

333
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,240
connoisseur weed

334
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
right yeah i would say all this is

335
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,600
pretty like standard and not argued

336
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
about that much

337
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
yeah that much that much it's it's

338
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,959
considered to be correct i think that

339
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,519
that much is considered one once you get

340
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,599
into like who's responsible for what and

341
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,159
what happened when and how and all that

342
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,079
that's where it gets kind of dicey yeah

343
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,439
but basically what seems like and

344
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,278
there's a lot of stuff where you read

345
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
online where it'll talk about like it's

346
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,000
a

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,278
colombian by indian by thai by mexican

348
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,720
um

349
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,360
you know uh

350
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
sam swears that it's colo by colo

351
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,639
yeah

352
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,759
you know and all that stuff was added

353
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
way later

354
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,919
and isn't really part of it i remember

355
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,000
yeah he said the indian was added way

356
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,078
later if at all i don't remember was

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,839
that his claim or not i think he said

358
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,679
that the indian was in there but it was

359
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,600
like it was added as the separate

360
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,159
hybrids he offered

361
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,720
and never got mixed in with the

362
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,958
you know with the core with the core

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
amount of hate so we always had separate

364
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,039
haze

365
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,958
yeah so

366
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,078
you know when it really boils down to it

367
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,479
or whatever it just seems like haze was

368
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,479
you know a mix of colombian

369
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,639
strains or whatever that they got out of

370
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,680
seeds from import yeah and they got

371
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,278
lucky

372
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,958
and admittedly it doesn't seem like they

373
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,879
knew what the hell they were doing

374
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,719
yeah you know um

375
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,958
and it got pretty famous and so there's

376
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
a lot of stories and a lot of mystery

377
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,518
between

378
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:24,000
late 60s and mid 80s

379
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,320
there's stories out of santa cruz

380
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,480
um there's a series of brothers they

381
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,760
wrote some stuff and high top like

382
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,959
there's all these various things and

383
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,519
and uh

384
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,000
you know there they've been debated ad

385
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,078
nauseum other places so maybe we don't

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,639
need to like delve into that part

387
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,638
because you can find that everywhere but

388
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,000
what is part of it is that what's

389
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,360
indisputable

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is that in 84 84-ish or so

391
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,959
um sam skunk man brought it to

392
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,399
holland

393
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,919
yeah

394
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
right so

395
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,559
these guys grew haze it got famous

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,679
um they were growing it in santa cruz

397
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,039
area

398
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,198
it was a mix of sativas mostly colombian

399
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,198
it was getting sold in new york and then

400
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,000
at some point sam took a version of it

401
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:10,958
to

402
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
holland

403
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,399
yes

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,198
and as far as we can tell

405
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,519
he um you know he gave it to three

406
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,519
people

407
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,959
right

408
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,600
yeah that's what yeah yeah he gave it to

409
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,439
uh uh positronics

410
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
who he actually worked with

411
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,680
yeah

412
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,480
and he gave it to corel from uh

413
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,559
super sativa seed club yep that carell

414
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,120
talked about when we interviewed him and

415
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:43,039
he gave it to neville yep

416
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,198
and um all three all three of those guys

417
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,919
made hybrids with it

418
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,479
and sold seeds

419
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,159
um from that and pretty much all haze

420
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,199
that we can really

421
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,799
we can really trace uh comes from either

422
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,679
those three people

423
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,599
or stock that made that sam made himself

424
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,958
in amsterdam later

425
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,600
yeah off seats he kept for himself

426
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,359
and we really don't have any verified

427
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,839
american

428
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,600
haze do

429
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,680
we yeah

430
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
i mean we have we have the original that

431
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,519
we all agree i think everybody agrees

432
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,198
that lund was a part of it

433
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,799
um debatable on the the lady kathy yeah

434
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,159
it's debatable we don't have i'm just

435
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,399
gonna say first name since it doesn't

436
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:32,799
really neither here nor dare but um

437
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,360
there is one guy who keeps all the

438
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,439
posters and as he explained it to me

439
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,919
was that that the posters were hung up

440
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,240
in the dealer's houses that were

441
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,360
verified legit haze dealers and that's

442
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,278
kind of how they verified if they were

443
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
getting real haze or not if that poster

444
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,360
was in their room then they knew that

445
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,278
they were getting legit hey there so

446
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
that's how he told it now if it's true

447
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,519
or not i don't know but he seems to have

448
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,838
the lion's share of the original posters

449
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
and he got them somehow

450
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
yeah

451
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,320
somehow yeah

452
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,519
so

453
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
you know and then like a lot of those

454
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,919
things like

455
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,399
not everybody

456
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,479
um not everybody involved uh has

457
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,039
probably has told their story publicly

458
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,560
yeah by any means yeah and so and you

459
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,078
know there's a few people that are loud

460
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,399
about it that insist they know what's

461
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,278
going on and but what we know is it made

462
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
it there

463
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,519
yeah it made it to amsterdam and

464
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,079
everybody's all the stuff that made haze

465
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,320
famous sort of came from amsterdam back

466
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,319
to america yeah

467
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,278
i would say yeah

468
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,959
wouldn't you yeah i think yeah it didn't

469
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,039
it wasn't like haze popped up here and

470
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,319
kept rocking and everybody's rocking a

471
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,759
cut from here

472
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,600
so what we don't know is it seems like

473
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,199
you know when we interviewed corel from

474
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,120
super saint eva seed club he gave us a

475
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,758
pretty interesting tidbit

476
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
and that uh sam only he didn't think sam

477
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,159
had that many seeds of it because he

478
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,159
only gave him like 10. yeah

479
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,039
and he thought that he only gave neville

480
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,919
some

481
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,480
devil disputes that um but be that as it

482
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,199
may um

483
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
you know uh um

484
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,439
neville ended up probably making the

485
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
most famous hybrids with it

486
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,679
by far

487
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
yeah by far

488
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
you could say that you know um but

489
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:19,918
positronics had it as well original and

490
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,600
so did uh super sativa c club yeah

491
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,038
they all had originals and it seems like

492
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,119
when you read the stories about what

493
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,519
neville and all the rest of them did

494
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,879
is that uh they were kind of like us

495
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,960
growing you know it's kind of like the

496
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,559
sour that you know a lot of the starting

497
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
stories it was like a bunch of kids that

498
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,879
were young

499
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,558
that didn't know what the [ __ ] they were

500
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,960
doing at all

501
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,399
and they made a bunch of rookie mistakes

502
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,319
yeah because they weren't used to

503
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,280
growing something that took 22 weeks or

504
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,439
whatever and it was a jungle plan and

505
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,798
you know and it seems like a number of

506
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,558
them got lost

507
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,519
yeah by everybody

508
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,119
accidents didn't you know mom got killed

509
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,200
they didn't think it was worth much it

510
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,479
took you know 25 weeks and never

511
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
finished

512
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,279
um you know that kind of thing and so

513
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,960
um they didn't realize what kind of gold

514
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,279
they had

515
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,440
i don't know not at the time

516
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,519
so much hindsight needed for that yeah

517
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,759
they had they had no idea so neville

518
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,359
neville had you know a few males and a

519
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,720
few females that he burned through and

520
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,678
didn't keep

521
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,640
um

522
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,038
before he you know he ended up i mean he

523
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,480
ended up only by 1990 he only had one

524
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,400
plant that had lived

525
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,960
yeah

526
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,720
you know um and so

527
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,880
someone keeps asking i did sam get

528
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,798
invited sam's never wanted to come on

529
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,280
the show so no

530
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,000
i mean i tried to be honest that's why i

531
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:43,038
i said at first like if you want to hear

532
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,599
sam's opinion about it um there you

533
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,279
could go hunt on overgrow you know

534
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,959
archives or something or anything like

535
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,960
that like he's posted

536
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,440
a ton

537
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,600
on his opinion about it it's there's not

538
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,038
a shortage of sam's written history

539
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,159
that's why we didn't focus on it for

540
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,119
that long

541
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,000
um you know he disagreed with me on the

542
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:07,599
uh kathy part so he said that the grand

543
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,359
daddy mike was incorrect on that

544
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,879
you know that that's that's what he said

545
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,119
and it might be true you know so yeah uh

546
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
that's what little i know from him after

547
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,279
i told the story the last time based on

548
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,798
granddaddy mike um that's the one thing

549
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,119
that he had he said it was it was very

550
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,119
good but that's not correct

551
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,639
so but from

552
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,319
the reason why we kind of glossed over

553
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,000
that part is that it's the hardest part

554
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,399
to talk about because it's the least

555
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,919
documented yeah you know and it's a

556
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
bunch of history from a bunch of people

557
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,600
doing some black market illegal [ __ ] in

558
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,639
america yeah all trying to stay under

559
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,959
the radar

560
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,880
and as far as um

561
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,798
as far as the uh

562
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,080
you know the haze goes and everybody

563
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,480
knows hayes

564
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,678
what we just mentioned positronics

565
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,558
uh neville's stuff and super sativa seed

566
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,600
club and sam are the sources

567
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,918
yeah

568
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,119
that all the haze that we talk about now

569
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
descends from

570
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,798
yeah that's where that's where it all

571
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,440
comes from it's either hybrids they made

572
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,519
or descendants of it or whatever and all

573
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,279
the companies like the flying dutchman

574
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,240
or any of these different groups uh

575
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,678
seeds men that sold pure haze

576
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,919
i believe they were all just buying

577
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,440
kilos wholesale from sam

578
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,360
yeah i don't know i'd love to be able to

579
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,038
ask him for sure but it sounds like he

580
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,558
was doing a lot of reselling like that

581
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,640
yeah i mean he basically what it sounds

582
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,639
like is to not get in trouble

583
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,880
uh he didn't sell directly to anyone

584
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,880
outside of holland because seed sales

585
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,440
within holland were legal

586
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,360
yeah so he was willing to wholesale

587
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
but he wasn't willing to retail

588
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,519
yeah

589
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,519
so he ended up working through

590
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,679
positronics he ended up i mean that's

591
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,279
how i mean you know it's funny when

592
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
people talk about all this like rare

593
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,359
skunk one that used to exist

594
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,960
and we asked carell about it he just

595
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,279
laughed and he said everyone gets skunk

596
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,038
one from you know buying bags of seed

597
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,000
from sam stuntman

598
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,158
yeah

599
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,279
that's where you got your skunk one

600
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,360
yeah

601
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,918
right

602
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,918
santa cruz

603
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,319
someone asked about the ac tase related

604
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,319
to santa cruz original haze um i was

605
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,439
just going to say that's that's by old

606
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,079
testament one who was british so

607
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,320
i really highly doubt it was sourced via

608
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,839
santa cruz

609
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,558
it's just my my theory on it um it

610
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,879
yeah i mean i think i think they sourced

611
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,599
it through a posi maybe yeah i don't

612
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,240
know who who i know i know tom hill's

613
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,918
haze line was positronic yeah his was

614
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,200
and it was his was very different from

615
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,440
the old timer hayes yeah so you know um

616
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,279
oh yeah all tom hill's work and stuff

617
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,519
and the and the deep chunk hybrids and

618
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,480
all that stuff about positronics

619
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,639
um

620
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,558
they uh

621
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,120
um that was all from

622
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:54,000
for a while there sam worked with on

623
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,759
some fashion at pozzi yeah i'm helping

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,038
them breed and do working with werner

625
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,359
and stuff like that and helping them

626
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,200
breed different stuff and and working

627
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,439
lines and positronics was just one of

628
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,759
those early seed companies

629
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,558
um you know when sam first moved to

630
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,558
amsterdam he was looking for connections

631
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,599
people to sell seeds to and people to

632
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:13,519
work with

633
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,599
yeah and he kind of ended up dealing

634
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,558
with everyone in town

635
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,639
but that was only like a few dudes yeah

636
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,000
that was really like ongoing then or

637
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,919
whatever right

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,519
and positronics also like a lot of

639
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,960
people don't know this part

640
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:31,440
but um the positronics haze 19 skunk one

641
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,360
is what gave birth and is the same thing

642
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,919
as the metal haze that i think bodhi

643
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,599
just released f3s of so if you do want

644
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,360
like a worked version of that line

645
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,959
that's a very good way to get it

646
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,879
so i don't know i've never heard numbers

647
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,798
until the corel interview but corel

648
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,679
swore that like

649
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,240
uh pozzi him neville they only got like

650
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,679
a handful like 10 seeds each yeah yeah

651
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,000
and then the first time i heard that too

652
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,840
and then um and then sam held the rest

653
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,240
back that he had for himself to make his

654
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,199
own open pollination that he did later

655
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,880
yeah

656
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
um but i you know i'd never heard that

657
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,600
before

658
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,559
um but then you know corel was there and

659
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,558
we weren't so exactly yeah uh you know

660
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,960
uh neville's dead now but he claims he

661
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,240
got big bags of old ass seed

662
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,079
but only got

663
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,558
you know eight or ten of them to pop out

664
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,158
of the entire thing yeah

665
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,440
you know um

666
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,120
you know and uh so

667
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,200
anyway they um

668
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,119
you know he comes in mid-80s or whatever

669
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,038
he comes here and and

670
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,639
he comes he comes from california to

671
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,960
holland and he sells

672
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,200
haze seeds to multiple different people

673
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,679
and starts working himself and that was

674
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,679
the start of hayes becoming famous yeah

675
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,519
um and it really didn't for at first

676
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,840
even like the very first thing that

677
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,558
saint that uh neville offered was

678
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,359
actually a northern lights crossed to a

679
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,200
female hazy head yeah

680
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,278
that was year one so there was like this

681
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,679
haze b that was a girl

682
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,599
and it was nl1 haze b

683
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,759
um and then the next year he came out

684
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,199
with nl5 haze

685
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,919
i didn't even know that i don't think i

686
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,240
knew that part about the b girl yeah

687
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
yeah yeah if you go look in the in the

688
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,079
88 catalog

689
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:16,000
um he has i think it's actually an nl1

690
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,960
by ruder alice

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
hybrid

692
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,600
and he crossed it to haze b

693
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,080
um and he talked about it being female

694
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,839
because he was like trying to to like

695
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,839
tame the the crazy lead time to flower

696

the the first two hybrids he really he

707
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,400
he really tried to make was uh um he

708
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:57,439
crossed it to maple leaf afghan tea

709
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,840
and uh he crossed it to um

710
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,558
uh nl5

711
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,918

um

714
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,839
uh the other one i don't think he

715
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,278
released to the public but he gave to

716
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,519

727
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,798
cool things about mr nice is that

728
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,880
um there was a time in oh 1009 you know

729
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,599
2010 or something where neville was very

730
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,600
active on there yeah and a ton of

731
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,839
knowledge about what happened

732
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,959
uh dropped both publicly and posts that

733
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:53,119
he made and via dm and communications

734
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,558
with various people that were active

735
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,719
at the time yeah um on mr nice and big

736
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,200
herb was definitely one of those guys

737
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,600
um that was active in communication and

738
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,919
like matt said he had a great write-up

739
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,439
on the history of it um that you can

740
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,360
probably still go read

741
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,120
yeah herb was around when when when

742
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,798
neville came back and i started getting

743
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,199
[ __ ] around with him and trying to

744
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,359
work the bubbas and all that [ __ ]

745
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,278
and uh it kind of petered off on the mr

746
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,519
nice forums after that it really really

747
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,038
took a dive after all that [ __ ] yeah so

748
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,960
somebody's asked a question which i'll

749
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,798
answer just because it ties in

750
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,720
uh they were asking did neville have

751
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,960
both an a and a c male and did he use

752
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,360
them to breed in various things

753
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,519
um so what it sounds like

754
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,798
uh is that neville ended up with two

755
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,679
guys

756
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,558
right yeah and uh the a and the a and

757
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,480
the c

758
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,038
right and

759
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,278
it was easier to use the males because

760
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,599
it was easier to collect pollen and then

761
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,240
dust a bunch of indica females at the

762
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,719
appropriate time than it was to try to

763
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,079
deal with the females i guess yeah so

764
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,679
for lack of a better way he ended up

765
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,199
with a couple boys

766
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,000
and um

767
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,759
the

768
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,880
uh the a

769
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,038
uh he lost in 1989 he did a huge seed

770
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,240
increase and put all of his best indicas

771
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,480
in there like the g13 and the nl5 and a

772
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,400
bunch of different stuff and then him

773
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,759
and his workers forgot to keep a backup

774
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
in the bedroom

775
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,640
yeah so he bloomed every a male and they

776
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,079
all died and he lost it

777
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
so after that

778
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,599
happened so often keeping big libraries

779
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,919
too

780
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,558
so he never sold any commercial he never

781
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,320
sold any commercial amounts of jese yeah

782
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,000
he popped them himself and gave out

783
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,119
various phenos of it which we'll get to

784
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,038
in a little bit

785
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,038
and he might he gave some private

786
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:42,319
amounts of seed to friends

787
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,839
um other breeders uh people early on you

788
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,359
know what not but

789
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,558
it was never sold commercially so

790
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,079
everything you ever could buy

791
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:53,440
commercially was the sea dad

792
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:55,759
so all nl5 has all nl5 haze that you

793
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,278
could buy from the seed bank or from

794
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:01,200
scentsy seeds was the c dad

795
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,599
right and that's so that's kind of like

796
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
what everybody's got

797
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,278
yeah i'd bring big herb on the live i

798
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,278
don't know if he's ready to just beat

799
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,679
pop on on camera all of a sudden but

800
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,519
he's more than welcome to come on

801
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,440
no but uh we'll re we'll definitely

802
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,440
reach out to you after the show he's a

803
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,320
wealth of knowledge yeah and and would

804
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,480
be cool to add to things but um

805
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,879
you know so neville

806
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,558
neville had and nl5 hayes was probably

807
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,159
the most famous

808
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,038
it's probably what put hayes on the map

809
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,120
to be perfectly honest yeah uh and what

810
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,599
i mean by that is that it it just made

811
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,239
it a permanent part of cannabis lore

812
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,278
yeah it inundated the united states it

813
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,319
did and he you know in 89 and 90 the

814
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,240
pictures on the front of his catalog or

815
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:50,000
an nl5 haze a

816
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,798
yeah uh huge running colas big bud you

817
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,759
know

818
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,918
all that and it was that and super skunk

819
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,480
ended up being him and scentsy's

820
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,200
best-selling seedlings

821
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,480
so nl5 haze kind of changed the game

822
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
and um

823
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,798
it was super potent

824
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,480
and it's probably i've said it on shows

825
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,480
with matt before in my opinion it's

826
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,679
probably the most successful hybrid ever

827
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,679
made

828
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,679
i wonder if it's because like

829
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,360
the line was kicking out more

830
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,600
keepers you know things that people

831
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,678
wanted or just because so many were sold

832
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,119
you were eventually gonna find a keeper

833
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,640
because it wasn't super easy to find

834
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,798
keepers in all those packs was it i

835
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,120
never found a [ __ ] keeper yeah and i

836
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,000
bought i definitely i bought plenty of

837
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,519
packs

838
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,839
yeah not plenty but i mean i probably

839
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,079
bought seven or eight packs in the in

840
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,678
the in the mid-90s

841
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,918
but then other people from that same

842
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,679
year and same era as me uh there's

843
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,080
things that are still traded today that

844
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,440
were found right around then yeah

845
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,519
so it's just the myth it's just the

846
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,798
mystery of seeds you can find it in one

847
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,558
and you might not find it in 200 yeah in

848
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,798
a way you know

849
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,000
but it seems like that that strain was

850
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:59,359
consistent from somewhere to 89 to the

851
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,480
mid 90s

852
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:05,038
yeah uh neville says they lost the nl5

853
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,038
mom before he left scentsy which was in

854
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,038
95-96

855
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,759
um but

856
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,679
and and basically like all the all the

857
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,038
haze that we know of all the phenos that

858
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,679
have been kept

859
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,240
all seem to trace back to that late 80s

860
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,000
through mid 90s era yeah

861
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,558
and there's a fun like yeah and there's

862
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,720
a [ __ ] bunch of them

863
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,519
right there's a shitload i mean some

864
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,839
that may not even be identified as nl5

865
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,398
hayes like bull rider might be nl5 base

866
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,918
based you know yeah old betsy yeah

867
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:37,439
exactly the sister of bull rider or

868
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,919
whatever but yeah

869
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,798
so what ends up happening is that

870
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,278
um

871
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,918
maybe we can like uh

872
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,278
you know that's interesting uh big herb

873
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,240
because we've always wondered there's

874
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,319
been a rumor that the cuban black um

875
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,359
could have been from gifted seeds to

876
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,359
someone that neville knew

877
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,359
you know and it could be it could have

878
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,439
been a in that case um

879
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,719
but i've heard that rumor too i don't

880
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,840
know if it's true

881
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
um but uh i poo poo the cuban black i

882
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,038
don't give a [ __ ] what anyone says like

883
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,000
the at least the clones circulating

884
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:11,759
right now

885
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,119
in the community because i knew exactly

886
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,519
who brought it in and that dude kept

887
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,479
[ __ ] lying about everything he had so

888
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,359
i think it's very i'm very skeptical

889
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,960
skeptical with what uh

890
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,798
with what goes around today as a cuban

891
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,038
black case it might be some kind of l5

892
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:27,839
phase but it is not the original i know

893
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,079
where

894
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,519
what what you know i mean we can you

895
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,199
know we're bouncing around and i

896
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,839
apologize because it's like a a

897
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,960
multi-decade story or whatever but yeah

898
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:38,879
basically

899
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,480
uh and we can dive into different parts

900
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,919
at different times but

901
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,200
um basically between you know 89 and and

902
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,000
95 or so there's probably like

903
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,558
uh

904
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,200
10 or 15 elites

905
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,278
maybe a few more yeah that have survived

906
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,960
from that era that are all named cuts

907
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,880
and still held onto

908
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,038
yeah um of

909
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,519
mostly nl5 haze

910
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:06,879
um whether it uses the a dad of the c

911
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,839
dad but some g13 haze some hash plant

912
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,320
haze

913
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,240
um various different things

914
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,278
yeah you know i've only ever had the

915
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,278
hash plant haze and hybrids

916
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,200
they um so basically yeah neville

917
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,960
basically crossed it to like all his

918
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,798
best indicas

919
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,679
yeah so it got crossed the hash plant it

920
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,639
got crossed to g13 it got crossed to nl5

921
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,759
it got crossed the nl1 uh anything that

922
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,360
he had that was an indica that he

923
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,480
thought was a bomb clone

924
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,359
yeah

925
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,120
uh got you know so so that's kind of

926
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,639
where like people are talking piff isn't

927
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,239
one thing all this we'll get to that in

928
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,440
a second but basically what happened is

929
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,440
is that

930
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,240
there's a whole series we can talk about

931
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,720
of famous clones in europe

932
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,599
that neville hunted and found and then

933
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,600
passed out to france yeah and those got

934
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,599
those got held and like some people call

935
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,558
them the southern the i almost said

936
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,240
southern humble the southern holland

937
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,480
south holland crew

938
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,960
yeah yeah south holland crew

939
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,599
um and they've been sold in coffee shops

940
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,840
for decades yeah when i when i first

941
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,398
went you know to coffee shops in in

942
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:15,278
amsterdam you could get nl5h8 you could

943
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:18,079
get a5 you could get c5 you could get

944
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,398
g13 you could get hash plant haze

945
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,158
basically every every trip i went

946
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,119
somewhere had

947
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,880
you know various versions of it yeah so

948
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,319
they were sold and a lot of people came

949
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,840
to holland to smoke those hazes

950
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,519
so there was these famous cuts and

951
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,439
there's a lot of them that are 30 years

952
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,720
old now or whatever that got

953
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,320
um

954
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,480
that got saved in europe and there's

955
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,918
like a whole map to that and then at the

956
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,278
same time

957
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,120
there was a bunch of people that were

958
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,759
trading seeds with neville

959
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,000
uh and buying a bunch of neville seeds

960
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,640
and it seems like a combination of new

961
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,519
york and florida

962
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,000
right um it blew up and got super

963
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,679
popular yeah and there was markets for

964
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,519
it a lot of the people in florida were

965
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,080
actually sending it to new york

966
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,038
because it blew up in new york and

967
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,119
got top dollar and there's rumors

968
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,358
that it's been kind of a thing in new

969
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,960
york since the 70s

970
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,279
like there's always been a high-end

971
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,240
clientele of like wall street brokers

972
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,720
musicians artists connected people that

973
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,759
are willing to drop big money for haze

974
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,279
yeah

975
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,679
as long as i've been a smoker you could

976
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,359
go to new york and find hayes yeah i

977
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,878
wonder why that is

978
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:33,358
it just caught on and never i don't know

979
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,519
um but like i wonder why dominicking

980
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,679
cruz picked up on it new york i wonder

981
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,800
why certain ethnic you know

982
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,440
groups just

983
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,039
navigated to that specific type is it

984
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,358
that new yorkers just tend to like more

985
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,440
speedy weed you know i mean

986
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,239
in in this case the best haze in the

987
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,200
world in my opinion is in amsterdam

988
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,358
and you know new york and florida yeah

989
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,679
the west coast gets jacked

990
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,639
like we literally we get jack and super

991
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,719
silver haze and uh you know like we get

992
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,480
a lot of hybrids of that kind of thing

993
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,759
and those are more like the poly hybrids

994
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,240
that came later

995
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,640
yeah right like uh you know they on the

996
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,679
east coast they have a bunch of f1s and

997
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,799
s1s of f1s and you know and there's a

998
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,399
people are going to talk about it you

999
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,440
know there's people talk about names

1000
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,920
like heights hayes downtown brown

1001
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,838
uh piff church

1002
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,920
uh cuban black

1003
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,000
um you know it seems like there was

1004
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,400
groups of dominicans and groups of

1005
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,800
cubans that had it on lockdown

1006
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
yeah you know people call it block work

1007
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,839
uh because they could get it on the

1008
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,199
block there was green haze there was

1009
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,159
brown haze

1010
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,319
right

1011
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,838
yeah and it's really hard if you're not

1012
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,559
from there uh to know all the different

1013
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,559
you know are they phenos are they the

1014
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,279
same thing grown different ways are they

1015
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,880
called different hybrid names is i mean

1016
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,320
i i talked to some people that were in

1017
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,079
the know

1018
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,680
and i used to think that it was like you

1019
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,960
know half a dozen names for the same

1020
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,078
couple cuts

1021
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,320
yeah

1022
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,240
but it turns out that in the 30 years

1023
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,119
that hayes has been popular in new york

1024
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,000
and florida there's a [ __ ] plethora

1025
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,838
yeah

1026
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,838
there's even there's like poo day that's

1027
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,199
another one i always wondered what that

1028
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,679
stood for

1029
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,679
because it's a weird word yeah i mean

1030
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,480
there's all kinds of nicknames and stuff

1031
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:22,319
and so yeah what's crazy about the haze

1032
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,679
is that the

1033
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,200
and don't take any offense to this

1034
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,960
anyone but like the cubans and the

1035
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,719
dominicans and whoever that were running

1036
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,960
it they viewed it very much so as a

1037
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,759
business yeah and they held that [ __ ]

1038
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,400
[ __ ] type they weren't into into

1039
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,400
sharing it with trading they had like a

1040
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,920
market and their market was good and

1041
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,760
they were into it and there's dudes that

1042
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,079
i've talked to that like their entire

1043
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,359
career basically just grown hays

1044
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,800
yeah

1045
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,039
you know that's all they needed to do

1046
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,640
was grow hays get it to new york boom

1047
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,679
they're good right so they don't share

1048
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,920
that [ __ ]

1049
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,719
so but what's interesting about that is

1050
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,639
like unlike a lot of like random cuts

1051
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,078
you get like where you kind of have to

1052
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:01,838
get the cut

1053
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,760
a lot of those dudes once they realize

1054
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,679
they couldn't get the real cut

1055
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,760
they just went and bought beans because

1056
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,039
you could still buy the line yeah and

1057
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,560
you but you know and it's like imagine

1058
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,679
if your buddies are selling it for a ton

1059
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,039
of money

1060
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,319
you might go to amsterdam and buy a

1061
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,559
hundred seeds

1062
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,960
yeah and come back and pop a bunch and

1063
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,078
then all of a sudden you've got the

1064
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,000
you know i've got i've got the piff yeah

1065
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,519
i've got the cube in black

1066
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,320
you know they called it

1067
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,239
my experience and this is this is uh

1068
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,680
i remember big herb i was trying to push

1069
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:33,759
a bunch of these off on him because i

1070
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,000
knew like no one wanted them but when i

1071
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,680
got the pif the dominicans asked me not

1072
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,838
to release it pure that was the only

1073
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,319
request they had don't release it pure

1074
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,000
and i wasn't going to [ __ ] snub that

1075
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,838
you know like you didn't want to piss

1076
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,838
anyone off so i never did but i really

1077
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,440
regret it yeah i mean they have a

1078
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,880
there's a market so i don't claim to be

1079
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,400
an expert i mean there's there's

1080
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,079
different people we could probably bring

1081
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
on maybe in the future

1082
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,160
that know a lot more about the various

1083
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,320
names and origins of the various

1084
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,399
different haze things from new york i

1085
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,960
just wanted to bring it up in general

1086
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,200
that there's a bunch of cuts that get

1087
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,280
passed around in florida and new york

1088
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,679
more but but florida too

1089
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,359
uh and a bunch in holland and between

1090
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,598
those two areas

1091
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,199
that's like 15 different cuts yeah at

1092
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,680
least a bunch

1093
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,799
so it's probably the line that has the

1094
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,279
mo we're lucky if one or two phenos of

1095
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,039
any famous thing survives from the 90s

1096
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,560
to today yeah

1097
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,039
right

1098
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,679
can you think of any other line from

1099
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,079
that era that has as many cuts as nl5

1100
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,078
haze does that still float around not

1101
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,880
even close man we're still trying to

1102
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,240
find a single a lot of these lines you

1103
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,000
know

1104
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,519
yeah so

1105
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,519
you know and so you know some of this

1106
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:51,199
stuff people are talking about gold or

1107
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:53,199
brown haze or whatever um in my opinion

1108
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,439
uh and i've seen it in like chem 4 and

1109
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,960
i've seen it in various strains you know

1110
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,720
certain strains just when it when

1111
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,280
they're when they're around oxygen they

1112
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,519
sort of cure a little bit brown

1113
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,280
yeah i used to get remember like the the

1114
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,039
real cherry pie when it was growing

1115
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,000
would be like deep purple and look all

1116
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,838
crazy

1117
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,639
when i did it depths and then i dry it

1118
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,039
and three weeks later it would the the

1119
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,480
purple would turn a little light brown

1120
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,159
oh man i hated that about like

1121
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,719
blackberries too like that beautiful

1122
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,239
magenta red as it dries it turns just as

1123
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,000
nasty

1124
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:27,118
and some of those some of those haze

1125
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,440
crosses turn brown as they dry it's the

1126
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,599
colombian influence i believe and so it

1127
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,000
might be terpius all get out and fresh

1128
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,838
and smell delicious and someone looks at

1129
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,480
it and they're like this shit's old

1130
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:42,320
yeah you have old weed you know

1131
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,079
so it's just like it's a it's a uh

1132
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,440
you know i mean even like we i was we

1133
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,039
were talking about it i was talking

1134
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,519
about it earlier today but i have a

1135
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,119
buddy who made the chocolate top the uh

1136
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,159
the chocolate diesel

1137
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,079
yeah right and it's and that stuff it's

1138
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,960
basically a chocolate tie by dog by sour

1139
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,039
diesel

1140
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,119
yeah and it was phenomenal and we had it

1141
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,800
for a long time and no one wanted to

1142
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,440
ever buy it because it cured a light

1143
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,119
brown yeah because the chocolate part

1144
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,119
wasn't so much it smelled like chocolate

1145
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,760
it was that the tie was brown

1146
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,160
yeah and and and like perel said back in

1147
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,000
the day they wanted that brown yeah but

1148
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,598
that brown was it was good brown it was

1149
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,838
fresh it wasn't like it was [ __ ] up

1150
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,400
but it just a little yellow little brown

1151
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,039
little off colors yeah but what's crazy

1152
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,960
about haze is that that is like death on

1153
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,279
the west coast

1154
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,679
right brown any kind of brown color at

1155
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,040
all and it's like doom and i i can see

1156
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,960
people in the comments or whatever

1157
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,440
talking about all the uptown brown's my

1158
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,280
favorite yeah that's the one

1159
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,559
i'd give me that brown

1160
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,640
yeah

1161
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,318
you know so

1162
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,279
uh there's a bunch of stuff like that

1163
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,838
where i can name them real quick um when

1164
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,480
we talk about a or c it's just basically

1165
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:56,400
like a holland shorthand for

1166
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,760
uh which ma which hayes male of

1167
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,800
neville's was used yeah right so there's

1168
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,640
at least three c5s um

1169
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,760
that float around holland that are still

1170
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:10,318
alive for sure um one of them is the is

1171
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,760
is called the one and that's the mom of

1172
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,199
uh super silver haze and it's floats

1173
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,640
around it's actually in america right

1174
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,679
now and it's what people some people if

1175
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,960
you see people posting in america of c5

1176
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,519
it's that cut

1177
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,440
okay so the c5 cut in america is the one

1178
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,000
the c5 cut in america is the it's like

1179
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,679
the terpenoline bomb yes it's what made

1180
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,440
super silver haze so traprindling

1181
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,279
dominant yeah you know

1182
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,838
um and uh

1183
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,599
you know and so it it's um it's being

1184
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,559
passed around it made it over the oh and

1185
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,160
it's really amazing uplifting super

1186
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,759
potent weed

1187
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,039
it just you have to be able to handle

1188
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,319
terpenoline

1189
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,318
yeah if you don't like turpentinelane

1190
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,480
it's going to be a real problem i smoked

1191
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,199
her pilling all day

1192
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,358
and uh and so there's like three c5s the

1193
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,199
final c5 was my favorite i used to smoke

1194
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,838
it over there in amsterdam

1195
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,960
it's the they call it the 122 or the

1196
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,920
mango

1197
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,440
and it's the mom of mango haze

1198
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,599
and it just taste it has more of that

1199
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,318
mercine ma like i don't forget i forget

1200
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,880
what the terp is that leads to mangoes

1201
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,480
but it smells like ripe mangoes

1202
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,280
and it's got a great high

1203
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,920
yeah

1204
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,079
c5 isn't ssh c5 is the mom of ssh

1205
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,920
someone just said so so then there's a

1206
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,039
there's three cuts of c5 at least over

1207
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,318
there there's two cuts of a5 they say

1208
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,440
there's a

1209
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,599
g13 a there's a g13c

1210
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,200
there's a hash plant by c

1211
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,440
um

1212
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,039
i might be missing a couple i don't know

1213
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,400
but but there's a bunch of them over

1214
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,880
there um

1215
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,800
and uh and then most of the ones in

1216
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,000
america are are you know nl5 across the

1217
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,640
sea

1218
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,079
yeah um even i should mention too that

1219
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:56,078
um neville gave soma of soma seeds some

1220
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,318
g13a

1221
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,599
and he took a male of that and all of

1222
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:04,559
soma's uh sativa and hazy lines

1223
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:08,720
are based off that that mail that he

1224
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,559
kept uh from some g13a seeds that he got

1225
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:14,000
and so what it seems like and neville

1226
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,559
was pretty open about this on um

1227
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,838
on the uh on the forums over there

1228
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,719
was

1229
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,000
uh hayes does not like being cross to

1230
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:26,159
itself

1231
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,480
no yeah at all and what becomes hard is

1232
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,639
especially with the sea

1233
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,039
the more you cross haze to itself

1234
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,719
uh neville called it cat piss we would

1235
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,800
probably uh we would probably call it um

1236
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,039
uh terpenoline

1237
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,960
but but the more you cross it you get

1238
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,880
terpenoline dominant and then only

1239
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,358
rarely do others any kind of and that's

1240
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,400
what everybody thinks of is jack

1241
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,078
jack terps train wreck terps yep uh

1242
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,480
super dubbing

1243
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,880
super silver haze terps uh that kind of

1244
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,800
stuff tends to dominate so yeah

1245
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,559
what it seems like is

1246
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,280
the best ones the ones that everybody

1247
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,318
keeps are the f1s yeah

1248
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,480
of haze to some indica

1249
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,199
and the poly hybrids like super silver

1250
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,679
haze mango haze uh jack herrera that

1251
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,118
kind of thing they don't seem to be as

1252
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,118
people don't seem to have keepers of

1253
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,559
those the same way not there's not cuts

1254
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,838
of them that don't float around it might

1255
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,199
be nice

1256
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:23,599
yeah

1257
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,919
um but we should mention too because

1258
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,680
it's [ __ ] we're it's kind of like a

1259
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
ramble or whatever but

1260
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,759
most of these things are they're one of

1261
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,639
the most unique things about haze is

1262
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,800
that

1263
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,960
most of the good ones take between 12

1264
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,920
and 16 weeks

1265
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,519
yeah

1266
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,119
a long time long time a long time like i

1267
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,559
think the cuban blacks and a lot of the

1268
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,000
ones in new york

1269
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:50,480
90 to 100 days is a pretty common

1270
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,079
uh rate to take those ones

1271
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,079
the dog [ __ ] which is about the only

1272
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,839
west coast one that's any good

1273
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,119
um that one's

1274
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:01,759
12 13 weeks easy you know

1275
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,720
um all the stuff from europe uh

1276
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,240
you know was is all 15 16 weeks

1277
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,679
yeah

1278
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,838
you know and so that was one of the

1279
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,118
things that neville and shanti and all

1280
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,519
those guys that were [ __ ] around with

1281
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,838
it one of their criteria was they didn't

1282
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,800
want anything longer than 16 weeks

1283
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,719
yeah

1284
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,119
because it was impractical because

1285
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,679
asking someone to flower something for

1286
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,160
four months is already impractical yeah

1287
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:28,480
especially if it's a money-making thing

1288
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,318
yeah yeah you know so there's an aspect

1289
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,240
where it's like i uh

1290
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:34,079
you know they cut it off they wanted 14

1291
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,838
to 16 weeks

1292
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,680
you know and it seems like the earliest

1293
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:41,039
good ones are more like 12 and 13.

1294
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,000
yeah you know

1295
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,838
um but 14 to 16 seems to be the most

1296
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,559
common range that a lot of them fall

1297
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,318
into i was a big fan of the old sog

1298
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,639
super silver haze that was one of my

1299
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,480
favorites that that ran pretty quick and

1300
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,239
was mostly skunk one dominant it's

1301
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,159
pretty cool sure yeah

1302
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:01,519
i mean those you know the super silver

1303
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,679
haze and the mango haze were both um two

1304
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,800
different nl5 haze moms crossed to the

1305
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,440
same skunk haze dad yeah

1306
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,359
right so the skunk helps like throw

1307
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,079
especially in the super silver it helped

1308
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:16,000
it throw bigger longer thicker colas

1309
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,318
yeah and it could shorten up the time a

1310
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,559
whole bunch

1311
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,559
in my opinion you know

1312
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,440
um and uh

1313
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:28,159
so you know they so then it just became

1314
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,240
going back it just became [ __ ] famous

1315
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:32,000
yeah everybody had haze

1316
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,159
and all these seed companies wanted to

1317
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,679
obscure exactly how they got haze but

1318
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,759
hayes just became

1319
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,440
haze for a while was sort of shorthand

1320
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,560
for sativa

1321
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,079
yeah it was the sativa

1322
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,639
right yeah

1323
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,800
and you know and uh it got famous in

1324
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,318
america it got famous over there

1325
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,359
it was all these various different

1326
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,838
things

1327
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,838
um and it seems like you know like i

1328
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,880
said the f1s seem to be a lot better

1329
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:01,039
than the poly hybrids yeah now the poly

1330
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,039
hybrids weren't nice i've i've grown

1331
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,358
nice super silver haze i've had keepers

1332
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,719
of mango haze i loved

1333
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,880
um but

1334
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,439
it seems like all the most favorite ones

1335
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,599
are f1 yeah

1336
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,159
so some type of afghani or [ __ ] crossed

1337
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,240
the haze across the haze very two very

1338
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,078
different things slapped together

1339
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,598
and then you see what they get yeah and

1340
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,480
even with those things crossed to it

1341
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,559
still the keepers were 14 16 weeks

1342
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,480
yeah so essentially like you're taking

1343
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,440
some colombian and like shortening it

1344
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,280
from

1345
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,920
20 to 24 to 14 to 16. i've seen uh

1346
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,599
columbia black go up to 26. that's

1347
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,519
[ __ ] insane yeah

1369
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,599

1370
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,838
colombian for pure dominican for pure

1371

they had a lot of nicknames yeah

1372
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,358
you know and probably just like kush and

1373
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,480
just like cookie just like everything

1374
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:36,078
else it got popular people got bag seeds

1375
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,838
people got lines

1376
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,519
from amsterdam still and popped their

1377
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,960
own thing and added their own name to it

1378
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,000
because they're trying to cash in on the

1379
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,720
thing

1380
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,440
so

1381
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,679
it's really hard to say but for rarely

1382
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,519
you know that line was available for

1383
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:52,879
seven or eight years in seed form

1384
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,639

1407
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,880
by the time i got san diego

1408
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,839

1409
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,559
some some good hazy cuts that you've

1410
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:46,558
tried uh

1411
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,680
cali mist

1412
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,800
smoke

1413
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:50,000
there's nothing you're not gonna smoke

1414
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,760
that has haze in it now that i think

1415
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,559
about i don't think i could name one

1416
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:59,040
could you i could yeah i i would there's

1417
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,559
there's not really a jack i've seen

1418
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,039
that i wished i had a jar on my on my

1419
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,280
on my on my on my shelf there well so

1420
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,239
jack you're gonna pass on a jack jack i

1421
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,000
would pass on the jack or pass on jack

1422
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:15,279
jack to me is like a huge yielding skunk

1423
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,039
one

1424
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,680
on a haze frame

1425
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,838
yeah you know and it's like just i

1426
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,399
i don't know it like the type of

1427
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,679
terpenoline that jack is is not my

1428
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,960
favorite

1429
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,879
it's more like

1430
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
it doesn't taste good to me

1431
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,559
you know i know people love it you know

1432
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,920
and people loved it because they got two

1433
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,240
three pounds of light with it and they

1434
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,838
crushed it in depths and greenhouses and

1435
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:40,959
they basically grew the [ __ ] out of it

1436
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,558
until the buyers were like uh

1437
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,920
you know yeah

1438
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,839
yeah

1439
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,159
how about indonesia have you tried

1440
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,159
amnesia yet amnesia some watered down

1441
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,558
[ __ ] i thought it was it's one of my

1442
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,558
favorites really all the reasons it is

1443
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,880
one of my favorites by far because it's

1444
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,559
so like perfumey fruity like it's just

1445
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,559
nice man

1446
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,200
yeah i don't know i mean i like i like

1447
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,480
the i like the church the frankincense

1448
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,519
the mercene

1449
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,199
yeah i can't i'm not a terpenolene hater

1450
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:12,318
by any means like i said i mean like i

1451
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,919
said c5 is a terpenoline bomb

1452
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:15,440
yeah but there's a difference to me

1453
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,240
between terpenoline that has a little

1454
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,800
bit of sweetness or creaminess behind it

1455
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,679
and like i just sprayed my mouth with

1456
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,318
like floor here yeah that's true and

1457
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,239
that that terpenoline you know it's like

1458
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,838
and i think for jack and stuff like that

1459
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,039
there was just a bunch of badly grown

1460
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,440
jack

1461
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,400
and it overwhelmed just like train wreck

1462
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,800
you know it overwhelms people yeah you

1463
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,318
know like that durbin um that durbin

1464
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,000
from colorado or whatever that one's a

1465
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:47,039
terpenoline bomb too sure is you know

1466
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,719
it is super terpene and you know it's

1467
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,199
like i like there's all kinds of weed i

1468
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,838
smoke i'm not a hater on it yeah um but

1469
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:54,558
when i when i the interesting part to me

1470
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:56,000
is

1471
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,519
it's not so much

1472
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,519
the only thing i can think of that's

1473
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,119
like really strong terpenelene that i

1474
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,039
love the high

1475
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,400
is the c5

1476
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:06,079
interesting

1477
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,119
i don't know what about that does it for

1478
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,119
you

1479
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,800
you know i don't know why that is but

1480
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,720
yeah um

1481
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,318
you know but they uh

1482
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,159
you know what's cool about it is that

1483
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,039
because it made money in coffee shops

1484
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,440
for so long and still does um it's still

1485
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,358
hoarded over there yeah and people

1486
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,519
accuse us supporting that [ __ ] is legit

1487
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,519
hoarded dude people are like so many

1488
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:28,318
people put stipulations on those [ __ ]

1489
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,759
cuts

1490
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,679
i mean like

1491
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,319
there are certain seed lines like me and

1492
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:36,000
caleb can never release

1493
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,759
no because they'll be they'll be super

1494
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,719
pissed off and people will be angry and

1495
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,640
it's like

1496
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,159
and you know it's been monetized over

1497
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,838
there for so long and been sold in

1498
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,598
coffee shops and if you got the cuts you

1499
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,039
had to give kickbacks to the dudes that

1500
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,880
i was like very

1501
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,159
so those things it's like and they don't

1502
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,920
give a [ __ ] they don't want to trade you

1503
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,598
for [ __ ] they have what they have and

1504
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,000
they don't it's so that's like the

1505
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,200
ultimate hoarding because honestly

1506
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,920
um

1507
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,799
they didn't slip out until neville died

1508
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,358
yeah

1509
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,119
yeah the entire time that he was alive

1510
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,279
that [ __ ] was on lockdown with those

1511
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,920
guys yep

1512
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,559
right yep and then

1513
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,760
two only two of those cuts maybe more

1514
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,400
but only you know but yeah

1515
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,359
i love that

1516
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,680
one of the sources for those cuts

1517
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,279
i was sent a list with those on me i was

1518
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,960
like i want those two

1519
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,400
and the dude didn't even know what the

1520
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,679
[ __ ] they were till i told them what

1521
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,680
they were and that was the biggest

1522
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,598
mistake i ever made

1523
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,199
i don't i don't like to dick people and

1524
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,039
be like you know i want to i'd like to

1525
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,558
trade equal value so even if they find

1526
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,759
out later it's rare they at least got

1527
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,880
their worth but

1528
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,280
yeah

1529
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,960
i mean the hard part is the hard part is

1530
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,720
that um

1531
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,280
you know these things would never be

1532
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:51,439
popular okay no you really have to you

1533
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,480
really have to like the high um because

1534
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,920
yeah

1535
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,199
you should know what you're growing too

1536
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,000
because i see a lot of people asking

1537
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:01,039
about the a5s ones and stuff like

1538
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
that that's not gonna be a super like

1539
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:06,000
uh marketable commercial crop nowadays

1540
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
that would sell really well i think

1541
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,280
people have this like fantasized idea

1542
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,960
because you're saying it's dank and they

1543
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,880
they respect your word they don't

1544
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,440
understand what it would with what this

1545
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,119
definition of dank would look like

1546
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,760
it's dank and ugly

1547
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,119
it is fun like i mentioned before like

1548
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,000
people were talking on the thing about

1549
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,599
how much they love the uptown brown yeah

1550
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,880
you couldn't sell uptown brown in

1551
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,318
california

1552
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,920
no [ __ ] way

1553
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,119
no way don't get me wrong even if i

1554
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,920
agree with you and i say that weed's

1555
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,519
amazing it still wouldn't sell here yeah

1556
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,440
it just couldn't and like if you see the

1557
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,759
pictures of a5 there's no resin

1558
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,599
production anywhere on any leaf

1559
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,680
for miles and you just look at it be

1560
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,640
like [ __ ] that dude sucks it growing but

1561
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,719
really it's it it's the plant it's ugly

1562
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,558
yeah but it works

1563
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,480
you know and so you really have to be

1564
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,839
into the high so it's like they're every

1565
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,838
like all these dutch you're like trying

1566
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:58,400
to hoard it like americans are gonna

1567
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,239
like [ __ ] with their money yeah when you

1568
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,079
really have to be a consumer like a

1569
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,159
lover of cannabis because it takes four

1570
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,839
months so you have to plan that it's

1571
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,159
going to take twice as long as the rest

1572
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:10,798
of your [ __ ] yeah and you got to keep it

1573
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,639
happy and healthy and bug-free and pete

1574
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,920
and all the various issues free that

1575
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,519
long and it don't wash

1576
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,838
yeah and then you know and then you get

1577
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:24,159
some great weed yeah you know and so um

1578
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,000
so it's not you know but in in holland

1579
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,838
it's like all my first experiences with

1580
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,719

1581
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:29,679

1582
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:31,279
yeah

1583
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,318
and maybe i could tell a story that

1584
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,319
people uh people might like so i went

1585
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,279
and saw this room in in holland that was

1586
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:41,679

1587
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,680

gallon pot with this stem that's like

1608
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:23,920
half as wide as the pot yeah going six

1609
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,159
feet straight up and then branches

1610

1616
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,199
conversation with seattle greg the other

1617
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,440
day and he said when he went into

1618

neville's grow room

1619
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,200
he said when he first got there neville

1620
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,558
was growing rockwool slabs on the ground

1621

on the ground yeah and they had they had

1622
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,599
drains in there or whatever else and

1623
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,280
they would be honest like the slowest

1624
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,640
constant drip ever you know um but it

1625
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,519
was like you're looking at literally

1626

and it started at above i'm six three it

1630
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,519
started above my head that's like i

and from seven to ten feet was where

1644
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,920
most of the weed was and then the lights

1645
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,440
were hanging off the ceiling and it was

1646
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,599
like six feet like you looked and there

1647
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,798
was like a sea of

1648
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,160
bran of stock coming out of the thing

1649
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:43,759
and going up above your head and then

1650
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,399
branching out into huge branches all

1651
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,160
over that's wild it was pretty well i've

1652
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,079
never seen at the time i'd never seen

1653
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,078
anything like that before in my life

1654
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,119
because people people are confusing

1655
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,200
they're saying they thought you were

1656
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,880
five foot ten no that's me i'm five foot

1657
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:59,039
ten

1658
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,680
yeah i'm six three so

1659
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,519
it was above my head and um you know

1660
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,239
what's crazy about that is that their

1661
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:08,400
drip system fails for instance that

1662
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:10,318
shit's dead in like two hours

1663
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,559
yeah that that's what's always scared me

1664
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,599
about like drip systems feeds hydroponic

1665
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,280
systems i mean it was literally on like

1666
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,880
the slowest drip you could imagine it

1667
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,920
was basically constant

1668
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,000
yeah

1669
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,680
you know it's constant feed during the

1670
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,719
light cycle you know

1671
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:25,679
so

1672
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:27,838
um

1673
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,598
yeah it was it was pretty but that's how

1674
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:32,558
they grew and that was neville's haze

1675
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,880
and the mango haze and the c5 yeah and

1676
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,519
those were all grown for coffee shops at

1677
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,280
the time yeah you know

1678
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:41,119
um and they were dank i mean the

1679
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,798
neville's haze um

1680
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,798
is is a5 by hay c

1681
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:48,559
you know and the cut that i love still

1682
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:51,519
exists i hope that it gets sent over to

1683
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,960
america sometime um i would go what the

1684
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,199
[ __ ] are you laughing at

1685
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,440
everybody's doubting my height

1686
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,439
no he's short as [ __ ] like ten

1687
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,318
huh liars

1688
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,920
he's uh he's short i don't know

1689
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:06,719
but lower

1690
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:10,480
he's he's he's short you know

1691
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:14,000
so 510 is a little short you're right

1692
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,318
he might uh i don't know

1693
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,679
girl pinocchio knows

1694
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:19,358
almost

1695
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,838
there is uh there was some really good

1696
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:22,960
neville's hazes there's there's rumor

1697
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:24,480
uh

1698
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,400
it's really hard to substantiate

1699
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,838
anything with shanti or any of the euro

1700
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,000
guys in general

1701
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,358
um so we don't know if neville's haze is

1702
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,400
the same or not

1703
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:34,880
yeah

1704
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:38,000
you know um we don't uh someone asked if

1705
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,160
we could break down karma's a5 s1 yeah

1706
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,639
you should change the name to snitch s1

1707
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,118
next he uh yeah i mean

1708
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:47,838
you know he he reversed the i i don't

1709
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,280
think the i don't think the um

1710
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,679
i don't think the haze is like being

1711
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,559
bred even to even the

1712
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:56,000
um out crosses of themselves yeah they

1713
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,960
certainly don't like that doesn't seem

1714
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,318
like they like to be s1 very much no

1715
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,639
there's a lot of ugly and then

1716
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,079
[ __ ] i mean yeah there's a lot

1717
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,078
of ugly you might get and that's part of

1718
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,280
the problem too is like when it comes to

1719
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,039
haze

1720
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,640
you know

1721
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,318
your the best stuff is going to be three

1722
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,078
to four months

1723
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,920
a bunch of it's going to be junk a bunch

1724
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,519
of it's going to be jungle weed

1725
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,159
yeah you're not going to know for

1726
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,599
forever it takes a long time to

1727
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,239
freaking uh

1728
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,240
you know to get it going so it's like i

1729
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,199
mean i could tell a story that i i've

1730
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:31,439
told privately or whatever but uh i went

1731
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,598
out i went out to the cannabis cup in i

1732
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,440
think it was 98 or something like that

1733
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,480
and uh it was the first year that they

1734
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,318
released

1735
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,719
uh neville's haze seats

1736
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,719
yeah okay and neville's haze was so

1737
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:45,679
everybody knows it was supposed to be a

1738
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,679
private breeding um of

1739
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:50,399
of neville's and he was trying to make

1740
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,318
what he called the holy grail yeah a

1741
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,079
haze line so he took

1742
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,599
um he took

1743
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:59,920
his favorite a5 um which which was on

1744
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,838
the cover of the 89 and 90 catalog that

1745
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,798
female and he threw that on the haze

1746
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:04,239
email

1747
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:06,719
yeah and it was the first time he tried

1748
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,000
to breed both haze dads into a single

1749
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,639
thing

1750
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,400
and they found this cut over there that

1751
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,879
was the strongest sativa i've ever

1752
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,639
smoked in my life

1753
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,000
i've talked about it before it's i

1754
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,159
remember

1755
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,798
that neville's hates oh it just never

1756
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:25,118
tastes peanut you know yeah yeah it it

1757
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,719
make i mean it it is unbelievably potent

1758
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,838
in a way that weed is not normally

1759
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:29,598
potent

1760
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:31,519
um and so

1761
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,680
i smoked it over there and it blew my

1762
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,440
head off like it it made it hard for me

1763
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:36,239
to walk downstairs

1764
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,358
yeah

1765
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:41,199
i like held onto the railing and i felt

1766
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:42,880
disassociated and i felt like it hit me

1767
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:46,078
in a weird it made me feel like i was

1768
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,160
smoking kind bud with no tolerance yeah

1769
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,079
like i got it was intense

1770
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,000
and i got high for hours and so i

1771
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,480
brought some of these seeds home and i'd

1772
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,599
never grown an extreme sativa before

1773
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,440
so

1774
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,119
i was going to breed with this [ __ ]

1775
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,480
and i grew it for a few months i took

1776
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,960
some cuttings

1777
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,199
and then once they rooted and i knew i

1778
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,079
had backup copies i flipped it to see

1779
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:10,399
what was up yeah well i flipped it at 12

1780
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,480
12 you know because it's like 1999 or

1781
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,798
something yeah i made that mistake

1782
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,798
before too yeah and it it vegged for

1783
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,079
months with no pistols yeah just you

1784
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:19,440
wait and you're like week seven you're

1785
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,039
like

1786
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,639
yeah and i was like what the [ __ ] like

1787
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,640
all my shit's finishing up and it's

1788
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,679
barely starting and i was like oh [ __ ]

1789
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,558
so

1790
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:31,519
i like i i tossed them and then i took

1791
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,798
clones and i flowered those

1792
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:34,079
and then i put more [ __ ] in there

1793
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:36,719
because i was trying to breed with it

1794
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,960
and then the same [ __ ] thing happened

1795
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:41,038
right and i didn't know at the time

1796
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,639
that a lot of those guys over there will

1797
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,640
tell you that if you really want to get

1798
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:47,199
your sativas to do well

1799
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:49,118
yeah clone them a few times and let the

1800
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:51,358
plant itself get to be six or seven

1801
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,519
months old yeah because that's its

1802
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:56,318
natural veg cycle before it would even

1803
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,920
start to bloom in the tropics yeah you

1804
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,519
got to realize it's going to veg for a

1805
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,358
long ass time

1806
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,920
and he's like no if you're getting an a5

1807
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:06,639
cut that was popped in 89 you can just

1808
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:10,079
flip it yeah obviously yeah and then i

1809
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:12,798
didn't know anything about 11 14 or 10

1810
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,559
11 13 or 10 14 or anything like that

1811
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:15,679
which is basically just like for people

1812
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,519
that don't grow

1813
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:21,679
it's uh how much hours of light and how

1814
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:23,519
much hours of darkness yeah so 12 12 for

1815
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:25,759
uh you know 22 years ago or whatever

1816
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:28,480
that was fine for all my indicas

1817
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,559
for neville's that was like veg

1818
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,318
yeah in order to get it to start i had

1819
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,640
to give it 11 hours of light and 13

1820
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:37,119
hours of darkness it had to be over six

1821
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:40,159
months old and then i had to finish it

1822
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,200
at 10 14 for like the final six weeks

1823
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,879
yeah

1824
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,639
yeah and so i [ __ ] up a bunch yeah i

1825
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,920
did that with the malawi too

1826
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:49,679
the boat is the one who taught me that

1827
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,519
trick because i would have never i

1828
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:54,078
wouldn't even made

1829
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:55,920
sense of it back then no i hadn't i had

1830
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,079
no idea i didn't i didn't even make

1831
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,519
sense of it until i had a buddy in

1832
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,440
amsterdam who

1833
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,400
grew for neville and i went back to

1834
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,960
europe

1835
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,680
and saw him the next year and told him

1836
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,519
like basically my follies yeah and he

1837
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,719
just laughed at me and he laid all that

1838
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:13,838
[ __ ] out

1839
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:15,598
yeah and i had fun i had no idea dude i

1840
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:18,318
mean it makes sense when someone says it

1841
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,200
like and then you're like oh

1842
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:23,038
god that makes sense and how easy yeah

1843
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:25,038
every other strain i'd ever grown of

1844
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,039
cannabis at that point in time when i

1845
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,200
turned the lights back to 12 12

1846
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,359
everything i needed to happen happened

1847
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:34,159
yeah that was my first experience with

1848
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:36,480
like weed that didn't do that

1849
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:38,078
you know and and so that's only with

1850
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,480
extreme sativas if it's got enough

1851
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,839
indica and it should trigger [ __ ] it's

1852
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,079
only if and it's only if it's from seed

1853
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,599
because seeds know they're young

1854
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,359
someone was asking if any of us had

1855
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,920
grown kelly missed here's an old

1856
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:54,318
original pack low numbered pack

1857
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,400
early on of cali mist that we haven't

1858
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:59,679
popped yet

1859
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,079
one day huh natso yeah one day

1860
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:04,719
um you know so i mean it should be said

1861
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,640
about the cali mist uh simon worked for

1862
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:09,279
neville

1863
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:11,838
its origins are unknown

1864
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,519
neville thinks that it's an nl5 haze a

1865
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:14,480
female

1866
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:15,679
um

1867
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,280
it uh

1868
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,719
but he think he you know he thought that

1869
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,798
everything in europe was based off his

1870
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,078
work so that's not surprise he thought

1871
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,159
everything in america was based off his

1872
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,720
work but what is interesting is that

1873
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,519
having talked to some dutch people

1874
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,558
um

1875
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,440
they say that um that the

1876
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,760
uh

1877
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,159
the the cali mist was based off a mother

1878
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,200
plant called the mango

1879
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:39,038
yeah

1880
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,199
now whether it's the same whether it's

1881
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,599
the same mango that that founded the

1882
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:45,598
mango haze and the 122

1883
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,359
or whether it's a different thing

1884
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,960
i can't say but they said for a long

1885
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,038
time it was alive in europe and then it

1886
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,639
got and then it got lost

1887
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,599
yeah

1888
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,639
so

1889
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:57,119
um

1890
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:58,719
people talking about kelly missed

1891
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,559
western winds i remember western winds

1892
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,719
has some cambo in it or supposed to be

1893
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,519
winds it's the same [ __ ] thing yeah

1894
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:08,318
and it has a camo in it so people did

1895
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,679
so people that uh people that um

1896
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,239
that don't know

1897
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,838
uh tony from sac martha and simon from

1898
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:17,279
sirius had a company that we talked

1899
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:18,078
about before cerebral seeds for one year

1900
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,400
right

1901
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,359
and they split up tony made sag martha

1902
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,318
seed simon made serious seeds

1903
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,719
and

1904
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,480
uh simon's version of the cali mist was

1905
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,480
called cali mist

1906
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,559
tony's version of the same line was

1907
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,159
called western winds

1908
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,280
which is i think one of the cooler names

1909
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,679
in cannabis

1910
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,920
i always liked the name western winds

1911
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,919
i thought that was a super neat name

1912
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,358
just makes me think of gas

1913
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,519
you know so

1914
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,199
so yeah so i've heard people in europe

1915
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:49,358
tell me that they preferred tony's

1916
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:51,118
version to simon's

1917
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:52,000
that the western wins

1918
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,920
um

1919
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,920
but you know then

1920
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,599
it's hard to say those guys don't really

1921
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,318
reveal parentage

1922
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,160
no

1923
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:01,279
uh we don't know what's in the cali mist

1924
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:04,798
we don't know what's in the bubble gum

1925
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,960
we don't know it's in the uh ak-47

1926
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:10,079
um it's it's hard to say

1927
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:13,280
um but but the the 90s cali missed uh

1928
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,798
simon got busted in 99 or 2000 when they

1929
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,039
changed the laws

1930
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:19,440
and it seems like several of his lines

1931
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,760
changed after that yeah and the cali

1932
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,599
mist was one of them but in the 90s

1933
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,640
there was some really amazing cali mist

1934
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,680
cuts

1935
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:30,000
yeah it was it was a nice

1936
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:31,598
um you know so

1937
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,760
um you know yeah it's it's that's kind

1938
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,519
of what happened it's like people

1939
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,119
you know people were getting you could

1940
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:40,719
buy um

1941
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:43,838
they called it uh pure haze f10

1942
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:46,639
remember from uh from uh flying dutchman

1943
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:48,558
yep and they'd straight up tell you 80

1944
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:51,358
of it is junk

1945
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:54,240
10 of it is is is pretty good

1946
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,159
and 10 of it is is special i don't know

1947
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,919
if if flying dutchman said that i know

1948
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,318
tom hill said that

1949
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,838
i'm pretty sure that in the description

1950
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,159
cause they talked about it they talked

1951
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:06,000
about how inbred it was already

1952
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,838
okay and that its best use was for

1953
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,559
hybrids and outcrossing

1954
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:13,038
but if you were trying to find a winner

1955
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,079
be prepared that only less than 10

1956
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,839
percent

1957
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,600
yeah so you'd have to do like at least

1958
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:18,640
101 hunt

1959
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,560
yep

1960
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,640
and so doing a hundred hundred plant

1961
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,679
haze hunt is a [ __ ] nightmare it's

1962
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,359
also expensive yes expensive and

1963
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,440
nightmarish because it's going to be a

1964
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,440
bunch of jungle weed

1965
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,198
and the shittiest looking weed

1966
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,119
could end up being fire

1967
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,719
yeah you're not going to know until you

1968
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:38,960
dry it and smoke it you're not going to

1969
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,640
know how potent it is it can be like

1970
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,920
look resin-less

1971
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,520
yeah and still take your head off

1972
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,359
right yep

1973
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,040
i mean so

1974
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:51,120
but what's cool about it

1975
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,798
is that it was so fire

1976
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,479
that it's become one of the most common

1977
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,238
names in cannabis

1978
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,759
and it's been blended into all kinds of

1979
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:58,879
[ __ ] for forever

1980
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,198
yeah

1981
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:04,400
you know blue dream has haze in it

1982
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:05,439
you know lots of lots of huge yielding

1983
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:07,358
plants

1984
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,719
have haze in their background because of

1985
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,520
that stretch

1986
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,600
yeah the stretch the yield

1987
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,520
the high if you could throw if you could

1988
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,600
like jack herrera was basically figuring

1989
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,839
out a way to get skunk buds on a haze

1990
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:23,600
frame yeah and if you could get a

1991
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:28,079
ginormous haze plant with huge skunk

1992
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:30,000
running colas and a little nl density

1993
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,000
then you're three pounds of light bro

1994
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,399
yeah

1995
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,679
yeah three pounds of light three pounds

1996
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,960
of light bro

1997
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,039
i just didn't know the days you're

1998
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,960
supposed to [ __ ]

1999
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,278
lollipop on for three pounds of light

2000
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,798
but i don't remember it anymore

2001
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,640
so maybe i don't know maybe we should

2002
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,079
we've been we've been random rambling

2003
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,199
about haze for a minute maybe we should

2004
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:53,920
talk a little about so neville made

2005
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,960
neville made all these um

2006
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,199
all these hybrids only a few of which he

2007
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,279
ended up selling to the public

2008
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:05,599
yeah but there was a bunch

2009
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:08,639
um like the g13 haze crosses and uh the

2010
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,360
the silver haze which was afghan a maple

2011
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,760
leaf afghan tea by haze and different

2012
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:16,079
things he passed out to friends

2013
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,679
and keep other people in amsterdam and

2014
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,960
even some people that bought seeds off

2015
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,760
him early on

2016
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,439
yeah

2017
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,880
so those things got spread out a little

2018
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,839
bit and there was keepers that were

2019
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,319
found

2020
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,760
even though you could never buy g13 by

2021
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:31,519
heisei

2022
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:34,800
yeah uh you know they had it

2023
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,400
and then you know um after that

2024
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,239
uh he started trying to make poly

2025
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:41,039
hybrids and blend them all together and

2026
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:43,439
cross various select cuts he'd found

2027
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:47,119
he tried to cross he was trying to do

2028
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:48,719
skunk skunk nl and hayes mixed together

2029
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:51,519
yeah because he considered those to be

2030
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:54,000
like the three most famous lines in in

2031
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,000
holland yeah so can i get a plant that

2032
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,760
contains all three

2033
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,198
and what it sounds like

2034
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:04,079
is it was just a terpenelli nightmare

2035
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:06,479

2062
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,079
ben and alan drunkers because they were

2063

2064
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:06,559

2070
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,560
pheno of it

01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,198
um that they had at the cup that they

2072
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:24,159

2073
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:26,879
released jack herrera as a seed line at

2074

scentsy seeds that uh at the cup that

2075

2083
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:49,119
[ __ ] uh brothers grimm c99

2084

2088
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,719
or whatever so

2089
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,640
yeah it's a backseat so it could be half

2090
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,119
jack or full jack

2091
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,560
as you know supposedly if you believe

2092
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,719
him it was found in a bud of jack

2093
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,400
herrera bought at a coffee shop

2094
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,760
yeah and he brought it home and did [ __ ]

2095
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:14,238
with it so

2096
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,640
um neville wasn't satisfied

2097
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:19,039
with the with jack carrera he felt it

2098
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:22,800
was still unfinished and he left

2099
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:24,880
um he left uh scentsy later that year

2100
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:28,000
and he kept working on

2101
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,279
the project and he got uh shanti baba to

2102
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,119
help him

2103
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:32,399
and they basically they had the mothers

2104
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,119
that they wanted they were going to use

2105
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,960
the c5 and the 122

2106
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,960
and they kept trying to find different

2107
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,079
skunk haze dads that would do what they

2108
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,679
wanted

2109
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:43,279
yeah and according to them

2110
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,560
it took a long time and a bunch of

2111
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:46,000
different males and a bunch of different

2112
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,800
growing [ __ ] out a bunch of pain in the

2113
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,359
ass

2114
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,119
but uh after a few years they found a

2115
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:52,319
skunk haze dad

2116
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,960
that worked

2117
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,719
and neville preferred that skunk haze

2118
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,239
crossed to the

2119
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,800
uh c5

2120
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:03,198
and shanti preferred that same dad

2121
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,960
crossed to the 122

2122
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:06,238
and they couldn't agree on which one was

2123
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,679
the better line and better

2124
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:09,919
representative

2125
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,840
so they released both

2126
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,760
and they called the

2127
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:19,119
skunk haze by c5 the super silver haze

2128
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:22,000
and they called the uh mango haze by

2129
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,679
same skunk dad mango haze

2130
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,760
you know super super haze is one that

2131
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,520
i've actually ran a bunch of and that's

2132
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,840
one that i had the hardest time finding

2133
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,000
keepers in but i have smoked others

2134
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,840
keepers like i said the old socks always

2135
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,600
one of my favorite but there are some

2136
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,039
really good keepers out there but i just

2137
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,840
never had luck with super silver i

2138
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:42,399
brought i brought some to um

2139
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,480
i think our party a couple of times it

2140
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,799
wasn't mine wasn't super elite i

2141
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:48,639
wouldn't say it was a nice cut um it

2142
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,719
yielded like crazy it was great to dap

2143
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,119
and great to grow outside yeah and it

2144
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:56,480
had a lot of qualities you want in mold

2145
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,399
resistance and just general happiness um

2146
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,000
you know it had a light terpene base or

2147
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:00,879
whatever but

2148
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,439
um

2149
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:06,079
but so basically super silver haze and

2150
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:10,879
neville and uh mango haze are two

2151
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:13,920
sisters crossed to the same dad

2152
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:16,400
you know so they're pretty close

2153
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,560
uh but they're just different you know

2154
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:21,119
um super silver haste tends to be more

2155
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,880
terpenoline mango haze tends to be a bit

2156
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:26,079
more immersing

2157
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:29,279
more bit more mango style i tend to i

2158
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:31,519
like the mango haze better as a haze

2159
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,119
uh the super silver haze is a crazy

2160
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,600
production plant

2161
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:36,719
yeah um and then i've had some euros

2162
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,600
tell me

2163
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,520
um

2164
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,440
like uh gene finder

2165
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,440
that they there was a super silver haze

2166
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,759
in europe that was like a 14 weaker that

2167
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:47,759
was like their all-time favorite

2168
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,119
interesting that one seems lost

2169
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,560
oh that sucks

2170
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,800
it does

2171
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,840
but there was an outlier that was a more

2172
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,480
hazy

2173
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,520
more you know more more you know less

2174
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:59,759
skunk

2175
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,960
more haze and that one was supposedly

2176
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,960
phenomenal

2177
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,679
um but in a poly hybrid it's going to be

2178
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,560
hard to to find something

2179
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,800
you know

2180
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,880
um neville complained

2181
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,880
that none of his poly hybrid work was as

2182
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,079
nice as any of the f1s

2183
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,679
yeah

2184
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:18,158
no matter how hard he tried they just

2185
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:21,199
weren't quite as good

2186
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:23,119
you know um but i will say

2187
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:24,799
that that neville's haze that he made

2188
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:26,158
it's the most potent sativa i've ever

2189
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,920
tried in my life

2190
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:28,960
and i know that cut still exists in

2191
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,920
europe

2192
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,920
yeah

2193
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,079
so it's really amazing you know what's

2194
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,079
interesting i just thought about it i

2195
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:39,760
don't think most breeders or seed makers

2196
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:39,760
even talk about the failures anymore

2197
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,079
no

2198
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,719
well that's because uh most of instagram

2199
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,640
and social media is marketing

2200
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,319
yeah yeah i guess it doesn't pay to talk

2201
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,520
about your failures like do you know

2202
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:54,238
what you know i mean you know what the

2203
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,719
greatest cure for powdery mildew was

2204
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:58,639
what kind of instagram oh oh you know

2205
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,399
you're right yeah it just disappeared

2206
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,800
never see it gone

2207
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:03,759
so weird yeah no one ever struggles with

2208
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,360
it

2209
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,760
right and then you know why because it

2210
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:09,198
gets curated out yep

2211
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,039
you're like oh this is a beautiful bud

2212
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:12,799
and there's like one spot of

2213
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,880
you know of mildew on a family for you

2214
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,480
or whatever and you're just like [ __ ]

2215
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,239
i remember you know

2216
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,959
this is a little off topic but i do

2217
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,559
remember when swerves cali connection

2218
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,719
story came out in high times and he was

2219
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,800
so proud you [ __ ] took pictures of it

2220
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,920
threw it online and the first thing

2221
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:32,960
everyone sees is big old powdery mildew

2222
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,800
[ __ ] spots all over his leaves

2223
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,800
yeah you we used to get grilled if you'd

2224
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,520
show up with powdery mildew on anything

2225
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:42,159
so i think the uh internet culture kind

2226
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,400
of negated that because people would get

2227
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,479
[ __ ] railed on see you want to know

2228
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:49,039
how i'm uh i'm not big on conspiracy

2229
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:51,119
theories yeah you know but i'll tell a

2230
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:52,640
story that most people don't know

2231
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:55,198
uh is that

2232
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:58,159
the thing that sent powdery mildew into

2233
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:01,439
northern california mendo and humble and

2234
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:03,599
made it forever an issue yeah was osama

2235
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,719
bin laden and 9 11.

2236
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,960
why is that

2237
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:10,158
it's [ __ ] crazy so

2238
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,719
9 11 happens right it's september 11th

2239
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:15,279
and he crashes he crashes these

2240
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,960
airliners into the twin towers right

2241
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:20,319
yeah so everybody's all freaked out and

2242
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:22,960
they shut down airliners for three days

2243
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:25,359
yeah okay but they were worried about

2244
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,439
them al qaeda planning biological

2245
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:29,839
attacks on cities

2246
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:32,079
so they grounded all america's spray

2247
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:35,119
planes so they couldn't spray biological

2248
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:37,679
agents for eight weeks

2249
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:39,599
okay so from september so from september

2250
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,920
11th all the way through september all

2251
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,120
the way through october no spray paints

2252
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,319
could be

2253
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:48,238
in marin in sonoma in napa in mendo you

2254
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:49,759
couldn't have spray plants okay and

2255
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:51,919
that's how a bunch of those places

2256
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:54,719
control powdery mildew

2257
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,279
wow okay so then in the santa rosa paper

2258
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,439
which is the big town in sonoma

2259
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,759
afterwards you see things like robert

2260
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:03,599
mondavi and other people losing millions

2261
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,400
of dollars in grapes this year to

2262
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,960
powdery mildew jesus and all those

2263
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:11,519
vineyards are all right by the highway

2264
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,719
yeah and i [ __ ] you not dude

2265
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,880
in the 90s and in 2000 2001 all the

2266
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:18,319
hydro stores i would go into

2267
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,079
none of them had any powdery mildew

2268
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:21,920
control

2269
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,439
none of my friends had powdery mildew

2270
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,960
powdery mildew was something that you

2271
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:27,919
got like

2272
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,239
outdoor maybe in october maybe a touch

2273
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,719
here and there if you got unlucky

2274
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:35,919
never saw it never saw it indoor never

2275
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:39,039
ever ever not not a single clone ever

2276
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,960
and within two months of 9 11 happening

2277
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:43,600
every single one of my friends had it

2278
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,319
yeah and then within a year or two every

2279
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:50,079
hydro store had a whole shelf

2280
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:51,198
oh no here's how to kill the [ __ ]

2281
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:53,760
you know there was stuff there was

2282
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:56,879
biologicals like aq10

2283
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,640
um you know there was there was uh you

2284
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,079
know you know there was it was learning

2285
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,239
about how to kill that [ __ ] and how to

2286
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:04,559
get rid of it was uncomfortable

2287
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:06,158
yeah it was really bunk because it

2288
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,080
looked like in the beginning it wasn't

2289
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:10,158
[ __ ] up your weed

2290
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:12,399
yeah but it really [ __ ] up your weed

2291
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:13,759
oh it really [ __ ] it up yeah you know

2292
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:15,039
it's like you think spider mites are

2293
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,520
[ __ ] up your weed they're not really

2294
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:19,119
[ __ ] up your weed no no no

2295
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:21,040
that's really really messing with your

2296
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:24,238
herb and so it took a number of years to

2297
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:26,158
figure out how to not transfer it how to

2298
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:27,279
you know no one had ever dealt with it

2299
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,119
yeah

2300
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:31,039
i'd never seen it like the first two

2301
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:33,439
three years i lived in california four

2302
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:36,079
years maybe i never saw a single indoor

2303
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:39,439
my friends or myself that ever had it

2304
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:41,279
yeah none that's crazy that's so nothing

2305
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:43,119
crazy and now it's like it and then once

2306
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:44,960
it became but then you if you if you

2307
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:47,359
think about it right imagine

2308
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:50,399
thousands of acres of grapes

2309
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,439
kicking off clouds as the highway drives

2310
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,599
by

2311
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:56,399
a pm that they can't treat

2312
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:58,800
jesus christ

2313
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,879
it just it just it just got all over

2314
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,600
people's [ __ ] tires it got kicked in

2315
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,560
the air it got all over the place and

2316
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,920
then

2317
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,280
it's like it's been i'm not saying that

2318
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,000
that's the only reason but it's been a

2319
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:11,840
problem ever since yeah in all honesty

2320
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,600
and then all those clones from norcal

2321
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,520
get spread out all over

2322
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,560
yeah and then people get pm and they

2323
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,960
don't know how to deal then they don't

2324
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,920
know how to get rid of it yeah

2325
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,158
and you know um and it's you know it's

2326
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,840
it's just one of those pathogens

2327
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:29,439
yeah it's it's obnoxious as

2328
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,360
[ __ ] it's it's evil

2329
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:33,759
i was just gonna run these by since

2330
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,519
we're winding down on time i was just

2331
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,119
looking these these were in the same bag

2332
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,159
with the cali mist and the bubble gum

2333
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:43,119
and stuff i actually was able recently

2334
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:44,559
to send a bunch of these back uh old uh

2335
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:46,479
spice of life

2336
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,239
i have some old legend sees actually my

2337
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:50,079
my last pack of the johnny blaze that

2338
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,759
people were mentioning i finally got the

2339
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:52,960
to get those back in the hands of red

2340
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,600
who made them

2341
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,079
so i think red might be making some new

2342
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,480
versions of the old legend seat stuff

2343
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,920
soon so people that were interested in

2344
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:04,799

yeah if you have a

2360
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:35,760
dying question that you have to ask

2361
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:37,279
uh can you speak on the highlights

2362
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,920
what's plant like how does it compare to

2363
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:41,439
the nl5 i'll do that real quick

2364
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,520
i also sent red back some legends

2365
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:45,759
ultimate indica dookie he also got the

2366
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,080
legends ultimate indica for me um

2367
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,000
hawaiian lights is

2368
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,920
oddly enough it's more afghani even than

2369
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,520
the nl5 it tends to be more broadleaf

2370
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,520
and expression

2371
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,280
we saw some bubba looking types in it

2372
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,800
that weren't bubba smelling but they

2373
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:00,319
were just the the typical above a

2374
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,159
structure

2375
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,319
lots of resin production

2376
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:07,519
there is some color in these lots of

2377
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:10,559
tropical terps lots of pineapple

2378
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,719
just all through the the tropical range

2379
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,159
um

2380
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,560
trying to think of what the best way to

2381
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:18,960
describe that is but it's really hard

2382
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,080
tropical i think tropical basically

2383
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:24,639
tropical afghani and that is essentially

2384
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,960
what hawaiian lights comes out like

2385
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,880
very variant but they all

2386
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,039
are pretty much broadleaf

2387
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,560
so yeah that's that's hawaiian lights in

2388
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:34,880
a nutshell we'll have caleb come on and

2389
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,719
talk more about it soon um

2390
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,279
we're going to be dropping the

2391
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:40,480
hybrids i believe this weekend

2392
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:41,759
i'm going to do my best i've been

2393
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:43,919
packaging a bunch trying to get through

2394
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,679
all the packages in order so once those

2395
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,359
are done then i'll add in the uh

2396
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,440
hawaiian lights hybrid so keep your eyes

2397
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:52,399
posted on wrightceco.com

2398
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:53,919
and humboldtcsi.com for both so there's

2399
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,198
a couple there's a bunch of questions

2400
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,359
out um

2401
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,719
there's uh there was some stuff on

2402
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:02,079
leather terps

2403
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:04,239
uh the a5 and some of the some of the

2404
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:05,519
rarer haze terps definitely have some

2405
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:07,919
leather in them

2406
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,560
uh animal and leather i actually kind of

2407
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,639
prefer that dark profile to like the

2408
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:16,239
super bright fruity

2409
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,760
terpenoline uh type of thing on it um

2410
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:20,079
you know there's there's haze lines

2411
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,840
available all over the trouble is just

2412
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:23,840
pulling out what you

2413
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,960
want out of them you know there's some

2414
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,440
america

2415
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,439
leather is also a motor rebels heroin

2416
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:31,198
his version of steep tux arowana which

2417
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,879
is very different it's very there's a

2418
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:34,479
lot of leather in it there we go someone

2419
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,760
else just said it too yeah yeah and

2420
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:37,678
there's um

2421
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,159
there's you know there's some american

2422
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:42,000
seed companies that i won't that are

2423
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,920
uh you know

2424
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,679
they're crossing things to cuban black

2425
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,920
and other haze things

2426
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,600
um there's obviously some european seed

2427
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,679
companies like shanti baba that have

2428
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,480
some stuff there's a big debate on what

2429
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:56,158
he's lost and what he's had but um you

2430
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:59,039
know you can definitely get it seems

2431
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,399
like the mango haze um is still really

2432
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:02,719
good from him

2433
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:05,119
um you know there's smaller breeders

2434
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:08,079
doing smaller work on hazes it

2435
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:09,840
definitely is easier to get it well i

2436
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:11,198
don't know easier to get but

2437
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,119
um

2438
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:14,879
you know there's there's good haze cuts

2439
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:16,719
out there that are starting to slip out

2440
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,159
a little bit more wide

2441
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,719
um yeah

2442
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:22,638
you know that kind of thing so

2443
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,880
you know uh people were talking about

2444
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,560
when did the first cookie pop out

2445
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,480
that's a whole show in itself but

2446
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,840
probably about probably like

2447
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:30,718
09 ish

2448
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,920
yeah

2449
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,399
i would say

2450
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,399
uh i can't talk about somebody mentioned

2451
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,559
the legitimacy of uh

2452
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,839
scott from rare danks neville's haze

2453
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,960
couldn't tell you

2454
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,119
just no idea uh you know neville's haze

2455
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,800
has been for sale for a long time if you

2456
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:48,800
use neville's haze from neville couldn't

2457
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,360
tell you what era was from

2458
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,320
um no information on that as far as that

2459
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:56,000
goes

2460
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:58,000
uh but you know um

2461
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,279
you know there's big debates people talk

2462
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,158
about newer

2463
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:03,359
newer releases of shanti stuff don't

2464
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:05,599
have that

2465
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:07,839
um people always get that way sometimes

2466
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,520
i wonder if it doesn't have that or just

2467
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,880
you found it in one or two packs and

2468
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,960
then you go through five or six more

2469
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,119
packs looking for it you don't find it

2470
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,039
yeah is it in there

2471
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,719
did you just not see it that time yeah

2472
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:20,880
did the luck of the draw not pop up you

2473
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:23,039
know because it's it's a it's a super

2474
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:25,600
[ __ ] to find one that you want

2475
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:27,760
purple haze was a super famous

2476
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,639
um haze from the original

2477
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,119
um

2478
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,319
haze lines from america you know they

2479
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,000
kind of sister

2480
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:35,119
they said they kind of bred it out on

2481
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,719
accident

2482
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:39,279
it was actually magenta haze on the

2483
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:42,000
poster now that i think about it magenta

2484
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:43,920
yeah you know um

2485
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,880
you know so the problem with haze is

2486
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,719
that it's hard to find keepers it's rare

2487
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,239
but there is a bunch of interest in it

2488
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,399
all of a sudden in the last two or three

2489
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:54,238
years and so that's gotten some american

2490
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:55,519
breeders collecting cuts and making

2491
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,158
hybrids

2492
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,639
um and you can find johnny come lately

2493
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,960
[ __ ] you know just just be

2494
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,639
prepared to hunt through some jungle

2495
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,359
weed and

2496
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,840
you know and don't don't let you know we

2497
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:11,119
should mention um we should mention that

2498
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,199
uh

2499
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:15,359
if we're talking about jungle weed there

2500
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:19,599
is a super famous cut

2501
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:22,238
of uh nl5 haze a i think in holland and

2502
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:24,639
it's called dr grinspoon

2503
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:27,039
it's it's called quays [ __ ]

2504
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,480
right okay whatever quays dr grinspoon

2505
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:30,800
i'm just gonna say most people probably

2506
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:33,359
know it is one s1 of the other it's not

2507
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:36,000
the same thing okay anyway quakes some

2508
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,759
call it quits yes so

2509
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,600
the point i was trying to make is when

2510
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,400
you watch this thing grow

2511
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,600
it's a million little calyxes like this

2512
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:45,519
[ __ ] big

2513
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,679
it's like the kind of thing where 99

2514
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,120
percent of growers would cut that [ __ ]

2515
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,840
halfway through

2516
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:52,399
right

2517
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,760
it produces a million little one-hitter

2518
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:57,279
type bong rips

2519
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:59,679
yeah but the weed outfits unbelievable

2520
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:01,359
yeah so if you're growing haze

2521
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,600
don't go by looks

2522
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:05,039
yeah wait until you can smoke it and see

2523
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,280
what the effect is and see what the

2524
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:10,639
taste is yeah because some of the

2525
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:13,279
shittiest looking weed imaginable

2526
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:15,279
and i'm talking ugly like like

2527
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:17,279
like haze is not

2528
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:20,719
ig photogenic

2529
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:21,840
no there is a lot of ugly haze

2530
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,960
brown

2531
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,560
shitty [ __ ] growth hairy looking but

2532
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,158
then you smoke it and it tears your head

2533
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,880
off and it tastes delicious and you're

2534
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:32,719
happy and giggling and life is good

2535
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,400
so you really have to make sure don't

2536
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,239
don't give up early

2537
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:38,799
because that's what everybody does uh

2538
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,879
yeah i bloomed out the quays didn't keep

2539
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,119
cuts i was like what's this [ __ ] and i

2540
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,560
did pollinate it but i was like

2541
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:47,198
i mean you know neville even talked

2542
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,360
about like his favorite female

2543
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:51,359
he blooms it out and it took 20 weeks

2544
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:53,359
and he thought it was the hairiest

2545
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,158
ugliest never finishing piece of [ __ ]

2546
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:55,679
ever

2547
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:57,679
and he cut it down and he hung it in a

2548
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,440
corner and he killed the mom and then a

2549
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,639
month later he made some hash out of it

2550
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:02,079
he said it was some of the best we just

2551
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,880
ever smoked in his life and he still

2552
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:06,479
regretted losing it yeah but by looks it

2553
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,600
was the ugliest piece of [ __ ] he'd ever

2554
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:08,799
seen

2555
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,639
yeah

2556
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,480
you know so you can't judge hayes hey

2557
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,760
this is not cookie haze is not

2558
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:15,759
photogenic

2559
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,280
haze what you're going for with haze is

2560
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,400
taste and effect

2561
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,279
yeah

2562
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:22,559
you know it's gonna be a gnarly big ugly

2563
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:24,719
plant you could get some pretty ones

2564
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:27,199
it's not impossible

2565
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,119
but don't give up if it looks hideous

2566
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:31,759
yeah there's only a few people i've seen

2567
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:34,639
make pure haze look photogenic and very

2568
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,239
very few yeah and then on top of that

2569
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:37,920
what's gonna happen more often than not

2570
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,519
is that ugly piece of [ __ ] that you held

2571
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,719
on to that you had dreams for that was

2572
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,080
going to be it isn't it and then it's

2573
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,279
just an ugly piece of [ __ ] you know and

2574
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:44,639
you're like yeah okay

2575
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:45,920
because that happened to me quite a bit

2576
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,760
too you know it's like i buy all this

2577
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,840
neville's haze and it takes me [ __ ]

2578
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,920
forever to do it and it's like 14 18

2579
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,119
whatever weeks and then i'm like oh i

2580
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,239
don't want to keep it

2581
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:58,000
yeah god no i will i will say like i

2582
01:29:56,238 --> 01:30:00,000
never really rocked rare dateless stuff

2583
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,840
just because the guy was a dick to me

2584
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,600
but um

2585
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,719
a lot of people do like the moonshine

2586
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,120
haze i i got to smoke it once at uh one

2587
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,719
of the jennifer cannabis cups at some

2588
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:11,760
mad ball or something i can't remember

2589
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,319
who was playing but it was some punk

2590
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:16,719
rock show and it was it was pretty good

2591
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,399
not gonna lie even as biased as i am it

2592
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,600
was pretty good for a [ __ ] haze i

2593
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:21,519
think rich did a good job on the

2594
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,520
moonshine if you limit your seeds to

2595
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,840
only people you think you like you're

2596
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,800
really limiting your seeds in cannabis

2597
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,639
yeah

2598
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,920
yeah very much so

2599
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:34,319
yeah sometimes weirdos and and [ __ ]

2600
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,000
and whatnot sometimes they pop out fire

2601
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:38,000
yeah you know

2602
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,279
yeah and it happens i don't even know

2603
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,600
dude so i'm not even dissing him i'm

2604
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:44,000
just saying that yeah yeah that

2605
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,600
that uh um it's tough that's what makes

2606
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,920
haze tough it's tough to find and so

2607
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,960
it's cool that people are trying to make

2608
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:53,119
like more accessible hazes and then it's

2609
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,639
kind of gaining in popularity again

2610
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:56,238
especially from some of these smaller

2611
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,639
seed companies and people trying to pump

2612
01:30:56,238 --> 01:31:00,799
it in new york because

2613
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,400
that'll keep it alive

2614
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,960
you need periodic

2615
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,719
booms of interest

2616
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,000
to keep things going

2617
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:09,520
yeah

2618
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,560
you know you really like i said when i

2619
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,480
was selling pith nobody wanted it and

2620
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,960
now it's very in demand i wish i would

2621
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:19,439
have sat on those seeds

2622
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,359
froze them you know till now but that's

2623
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,919
not how [ __ ] works

2624
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:26,559
i was i was joking about uh rare skunk

2625
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,719
one the other show yeah you know 15

2626
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,679
years ago you couldn't give skunk away

2627
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:30,560
no

2628
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,480
couldn't

2629
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,480
you know a lot of the companies put free

2630
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:36,638
skunk one or skunk haze or skunk

2631
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:38,399
whatever hybrids when hybrids out there

2632
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:40,079
yeah because they just had so much they

2633
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,439
just had so many stock and they never

2634
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,158
sold any so you might as well make

2635
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:45,359
people happy and throw in four seeds

2636
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:46,559
freebies

2637
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:48,079
yep

2638
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,400
now people are like well maybe there's

2639
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:53,679
some secret sauce in this old skunk one

2640
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:55,599
that i can find yeah the secret skunky

2641
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:58,079
smells you know you'd have a lot better

2642
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,360
luck hope hunting for something secret

2643
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:02,319
and haze

2644
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:04,719
yeah um then you would and skunk one

2645
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:06,719
that's for sure gunk one you people have

2646
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,760
probably pushed it to its limit

2647
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:09,520
yeah

2648
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,800
hey is there still surprises and people

2649
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,800
asked i should just remember because it

2650
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,800
popped into my head people asked about

2651
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:16,320
the band-aid haze 7

2652
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,880
yes because that's a cut that floats

2653
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:21,279
around i will say that people i respect

2654
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,679
like yo sami in europe and others

2655
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,639
have told me they view that cut

2656
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,440
as

2657
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:29,279
equal to the old cuts that they hold

2658
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:32,638
that's pretty cool so it's the first

2659
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:35,759
haze in a long time that they feel

2660
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:37,920
is as good and stands right there with

2661
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,520
those old 25 30 year old strains that

2662
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,960
have been kept forever that's

2663
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,719
interesting uh and it's a lot more

2664
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,439
accessible to people

2665
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:46,719
yeah uh in in you know in america than a

2666
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:48,559
lot of these other ones that i talk

2667
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:50,639
about these things are i should mention

2668
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,639
people think i'm connected or whatever i

2669
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:55,600
have been [ __ ] hunting all of these

2670
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:56,800
european haze cuts since the 90s

2671
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,880
yeah

2672
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:01,199
you know and it it it was like the white

2673
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,560
rabbit it was like multi decades of

2674
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:04,559
looking

2675
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,840
yeah and there's still some like that

2676
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,440
neville's haze cut i want that thing so

2677
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,199
bad um i know where it is

2678
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:12,799
i can't get it

2679
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:13,759
you know if it's in america i don't know

2680
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,239
about it

2681
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:19,360
yeah um you know but uh anyway the

2682
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:21,359
band-aid hey seven is an amazing cut

2683
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:23,679
uh amazing effect they're growing it

2684
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:25,839
over in europe they love it it's easier

2685
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:28,560
to get in america than the rest of them

2686
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:31,679
yeah it does take forever you know so be

2687
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:34,159
prepared to go 14 weeks or whatever um

2688
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,279
but it's a it's a fire cut by all

2689
01:33:34,158 --> 01:33:38,638
accounts

2690
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:39,920
yeah um and uh i believe that's cuban

2691
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:44,480
black

2692
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:47,279
uh haze cross two a5 tie

2693
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:48,079
i believe so yeah whatever cuban black

2694
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:51,198
is

2695
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:54,000
but yeah so whatever so it's possible

2696
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:56,960
that you know it's that it's it's a c5

2697
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,238
cut by an a5 cut by some a thai male to

2698
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,119
burdi pollen

2699
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:03,599
maybe maybe yeah but whatever case may

2700
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:05,279
be um there's a cut you can still buy

2701
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,199
band-aid hay seeds there's various

2702
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:09,759
versions of them and there's at least

2703
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,039
this one cut that came out uh elite

2704
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,800
status

2705
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:15,039
yeah and the people that have been

2706
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,639
running um a lot of these hazes for 30

2707
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:18,800
years if they think it's as good as the

2708
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,560
rest of them

2709
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,360
you know that's pretty high praise from

2710
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,600
them

2711
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:25,039
yeah yeah adoptee is doing a lot of work

2712
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,800
that he's a good dude

2713
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:29,039
so you know

2714
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,560
um yeah we did talk about tom hill just

2715
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:33,679
in in brief

2716
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,760
uh not very not for very long um

2717
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:37,760
you know but tom hill did release did

2718
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:40,719
have tom hill hayes

2719
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,239
and did have tom uh hate tom hill haze

2720
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:44,719
by deep chunk

2721
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:45,519
and uh maybe some other more work around

2722
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:48,079
that

2723
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:51,840
yeah uh and i believe all of his stuff

2724
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:54,000
descends from positronics haze lines

2725
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,440
the fuzzy brown is is

2726
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,840
kind of saying that you're wrong about

2727
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,638
a5 and c5 not existing i don't i think

2728
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,800
he's confused no they definitely exist

2729
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,560
yeah they definitely exist but what i'm

2730
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,239
saying is that there's there's various

2731
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,920
haze cuts that i know are alive in

2732
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:09,519
europe and i don't know if they're alive

2733
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,000
here

2734
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:13,600
yeah there's a5 and c5 that have popped

2735
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,198
up in america and there's a number of

2736
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,960
people that have them

2737
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:19,198
um there's still politics around

2738
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,198
releasing seed around it

2739
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:23,198
or trading it or whatever so they're

2740
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:24,638
still tough so they they're alive

2741
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:27,118
um some of them

2742
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:30,400
i should to be said uh some of them have

2743
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:32,799
uh some of them have the virus

2744
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:35,039
yeah so be careful

2745
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,800
yeah i haven't run the sssc hazes

2746
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:38,319
someone's asking about but

2747
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,320
um

2748
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:41,920
that's a good thing to mention because

2749
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:44,238
one of the things that's interesting is

2750
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,279
almost all the haze that's available

2751
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:47,359
is

2752
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:50,639
based off of neville's work which is a

2753
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:52,639
couple of males yeah right or some posi

2754
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,800
work or whatever but neville's seems to

2755
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:57,118
be the stuff that everybody found firing

2756
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,480
yeah and when we interviewed corel um

2757
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:00,799
corel had

2758
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:03,118
a they had a and it's been confirmed by

2759
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,880
friends of mine he has a 35 plus year

2760
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:07,679
old skunk haze

2761
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,719
yeah that he made from haze seeds given

2762
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,319
to him

2763
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:12,158
yeah and what's interesting about if you

2764
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:14,000
were to get carrel's work and cross it

2765
01:36:12,158 --> 01:36:17,118
to some of neville's work

2766
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,000
is that it's not neville's males

2767
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:21,920
yeah it's another genetic of haze

2768
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,279
yeah so it's not quite the same

2769
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,399
bottleneck

2770
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:27,840
yep um whatsoever

2771
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:29,279
you know because haze doesn't like being

2772
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,400
crossed to itself

2773
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:32,399
so

2774
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:34,638
and it's from that same batch of seed

2775
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:37,198
that neville got

2776
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:39,199
you know yeah so i didn't really realize

2777
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:40,879
that until we talked to him yeah that

something close somewhere in that new

2834

um that and and island sweet skunk is a

2839
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:54,638
little different than sweet skunk and

2840
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:56,880
then mark emery did this thing

2841
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:59,520
uh you know that confused the lineage of

2842
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,639
it um but as far as we can tell there is

2843
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,960
a real

2844
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:05,520
um there is a real sweet skunk that was

2845
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,639
basically mostly nl5 haze

2846
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,320
yeah

2847
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,760
and it got cropped did

2848
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:12,079
did uh

2849
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:13,199
um steve cross it to like grapefruit or

2850
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:15,279
something

2851
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,879
or yeah i don't know what it was crossed

2852
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:19,359
here

2853
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:22,159
so you know anyway um

2854
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:23,839
the uh you know fork you know so it's

2855
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:25,679
it's cool in the sense that there's a

2856
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,159
bunch of different phenos

2857
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,880
yeah that have survived

2858
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:32,719
you know um all females obviously we

2859
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,079

2860
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,319

01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:39,198
nl5 haze male pollen

2862
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:41,519

2863
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:43,519
yeah we have uh one of our buddies um

2864
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,080
kim blackburn is is a part of the cough

2865
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:48,719
crew so we have people closer to the cop

2866
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,559
that know the history of it real well so

2867
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:52,000
i'll probably bring him on at some point

2868
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,440

to go out there all the time and that's

2879

01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:22,799
not [ __ ] mad farmer he had nothing to

2940
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:24,159
do with that cut it was a cut at a blue

2941
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,480
sky cafe

2942
01:42:24,158 --> 01:42:27,679
um originally and it was made by lion

2943
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:29,759
something farms you can still find the

2944
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:31,920
info on icy mag way back when you made

2945
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,600
it long before mad farmer came to this

2946
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,840
and it's an aft gooey crust deep chunk

2947
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:38,639
it is not strawberry cough deep junk

2948
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,760
so it was just relabeled by blue sky

2949
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,840
there we go

2950
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,360
so i mean one of the things i should say

2951
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:45,600
about one of the things that draws

2952
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,599
people to hayes is that

2953
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,800
we live in an indica dominated it's like

2954
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:52,320
the exact opposite of the 70s and 80s

2955
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:55,119
uh where

2956
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:57,118
excuse me where sativa ruled the game

2957
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:58,960
yeah we live in an indica an indica

2958
01:42:57,118 --> 01:42:59,920
dominant scene

2959
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,679
yeah

2960
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:04,560
and hayes is a tie back to that ancient

2961
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,800
you know

2962
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,039
no longer available import

2963
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,600
and it seems like it gives people a

2964
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:13,840
better high in a different way

2965
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:16,159
it has a different high profile it hits

2966
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,560
people and even if people are extremely

2967
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:21,039
used to an experience with smoking chems

2968
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,880
or you know ogs or whatever you can

2969
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:26,000
smoke some haze

2970
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:28,079
and have it hit you like a brick

2971
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,399
um so even though it's ugly and takes a

2972
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:32,639
long time and has these various issues

2973
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:34,879
uh it's popular for my favorite reason

2974
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:36,239
for weed to be popular

2975
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,880
because it works

2976
01:43:36,238 --> 01:43:41,439
yeah effect it works good

2977
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,679
you know so that's the best reason to to

2978
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:45,599
like weed it's weed that works

2979
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:46,719
weed that works

2980
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,280
you know

2981
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:52,000
