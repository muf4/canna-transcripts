we're going to be talking about the the

40
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:37,039
reemergence of TGA seeds what it means

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,040
what it was where it's going now and uh

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,920
yeah so these are the two involved in it

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,600
and I think they're coming out with some

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,879
um pretty amazing new hybrids with the

45
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,718
space dude so real quick Miss Jill um if

46
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,280
you can give us a quick synopsis of TGA

47
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:55,640
what is what did TGA stand for

48
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,320
originally like obviously what does TGA

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,039
stand for and what did what was the

50
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,879
purpose the green Avenger or the green

51
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,570
Avengers yeah it was the purpose of

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,118
overgrowing the planet

53
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:08,878
[Music]

54
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,719
um as everyone together it was the green

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,719
Avengers and then we were the green

56
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,560
Avenger separately as our on our own but

57
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,840
as a as a whole we would be considered

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,439
the green Avengers it was our goal to

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,920
overgrow the planet with with cannabis

60
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,439
great

61
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,759
strains that's awesome and how long

62
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,239
would you say that it ran as a company

63
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,318
like when did it start and when did it

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,480
kind of slowly go back towards Miss Jill

65
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,839
genetics I would say I I believe TGA

66
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,079
started I

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,840
2001 we had a slow start we um started

68
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,200
with cannabis World on the auctions

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,360
actually and we were selling packs at $

70
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:52,318
five dollar and they were getting

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,840
returned wow times Y and as as time went

72
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,119
on we grew and and popularity and and

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,360
people started growing out the strains

74
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,840
and they really liked what they were

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,159
getting and the Cannabis uh move

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,959
movement started booming um people

77
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,158
started realizing what great medicine it

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,959
was and we just took off from there and

79
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:11,519
we were going very strong we moved to

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,319
California and we were doing really well

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,439
and then we had a fire in 2017 it was

82
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,679
October 2017 kind of took everything we

83
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,639
had all of our moms and thankfully we

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
still had some moms with um different

85
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,439
people yeah Seb and I both um split up

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,039
in one our different ways at that time

87
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:33,000
um put doing business together and I

88
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:35,679
ended up taking TGA and making M Jill

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,239
TGA genetics and sub went off and done

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,799
his um his own thing with subcool

91
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,680
seeds that's where we went and so during

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
the time of TGA there was a bunch of

93
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,080
people involved other than just you and

94
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,438
sub right there there were other people

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840
that were helping the collaborative

96
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:54,719
effort of putting these strains out yes

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,280
lots of um several other breeders yeah

98
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,479
and they've made their own name over the

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,400
over time um because of the work they

100
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,878
did with TGA as well which is I think

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,480
notable yes some really amazing stuff

102
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:11,000
yes so with that said I wanted to go

103
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:13,359
over some of your guys's best hits as

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,959
TGA early on and one of the first ones

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
that comes to mind is Jax cleaner and I

106
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,319
don't remember necessarily the genetics

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,879
of it it was like a what nl5 pluton um

108
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,439
Lamb's bread

109
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,279
um yeah that was in the pluton I think

110
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,879
yeah and then it said like purple haze I

111
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,079
think the the very end or something like

112
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,319
that do you remember Caleb oh no it had

113
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,478
a way too many things in it it had a lot

114
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,719
in it that pluton from um I think I

115
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:45,120
think it was s is that ssse

116
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,320
pluton I'm not certain yeah that one had

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,240
like lambs of bread all kinds of stuff

118
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,879
in it yeah I remember that Jack cleer

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,319
sub had before we had met that's right

120
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,319
and it was a combination of something

121
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,159
called The Cleaner too right or is that

122
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,759
something different Jack's cleaner that

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,720
was Jack cleaner and then from Jack's

124
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,319
cleaner

125
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,280
gotcha okay some of the other big hits

126
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,399
like Jack the Ripper obviously came from

127
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:14,159
Jack's cleaner and uh what do you know

128
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:17,359
what the parentage of that one was um I

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,360
do believe it was space queen yeah okay

130
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,479
so space the one of the first space

131
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,759
queen ones Jack the Ripper and that

132
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,719
became a huge hit for you guys yes Jack

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,560
the Ripper and then Jelly Bean after

134
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,120
that yeah and what was in Jelly Bean

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,639
that was um orange velvet which would

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,639
was originally um named Melvin when it

137
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,840
came to me I got it some from some

138
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,439
patients in Oregon MH and the Rumor was

139
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,399
they had gotten it from someone in Falls

140
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,839
City Oregon it had been around for 25

141
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,799
years at the time I got it so it would

142
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,879
be moving up on about 50 years old now

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,400
at this point that's insane that's

144
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,839
insane old ass plant um and and what did

145
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,318
you like about the Melvin when you first

146
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:01,799
saw it she was beautiful the a beautiful

147
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,840
plant um I I had to rename her because

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,918
Melvin just seems like such

149
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,719
a such a silly name for such a beautiful

150
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,959
plant she was she turned the most

151
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,840
beautiful colors almost black burgundy

152
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,038
black and she it looked like velvet the

153
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,638
leaves looked like velvet and she

154
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,560
smelled super orangey um about three

155
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,120
weeks into flour you start walking into

156
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,319
the Grom at first it starts smelling um

157
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,079
like a little bit like burnt rubber and

158
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,840
then goes on you get that real strong

159
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,359
orange smell and it was great for bag a

160
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,439
pill until you know you've had too much

161
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,960
of it you can you can only smoke so much

162
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,719
orange that strong for you know so long

163
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,120
before you start getting a little bit

164
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,680
tired of it yeah it's an extreme orange

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,160
and it and it bred well for its orange

166
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,400
traits yeah absolutely yeah and one of

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,680
those uh other plants would be agent

168
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,359
orange correct yes yeah that was one of

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,879
the first TGA strains that I had tried

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,439
was the agent orange and it had like an

171
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,598
orange soda um like orange crushed soda

172
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,879
type expression it was really beautiful

173
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,560
that was crossed with Jack the Ripper

174
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:07,439
okay so that was Jack the Ripper and the

175
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,439
Melvin yes or orange velvet orange

176
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,079
velvet I still think Melvin's a great

177
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,120
name

178
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,478
though um I have down here Sputnik one I

179
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,240
don't know if that was that big of a hit

180
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:21,318
or it was mostly a hit because it was in

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,199
books and it was so pink I think that um

182
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,319
mainly it was a big hit over the color

183
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,319
yeah it seemed to be a little bit Airy

184
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,919
and um a little more sativa leaning

185
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,280
um but it was it was absolutely

186
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,560
beautiful and it did have a great flavor

187
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,559
yeah yeah and then there's Danny Boy I

188
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,800
remember that being a big one I remember

189
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:48,959
it being very lemony um um Taco I think

190
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,319
okay Orga c99 I think that was the

191
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,519
taco and then we have stuff like the

192
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,919
quirl what can you tell us about the the

193
00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:00,719
original

194
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:02,240
perkle we had a um purple urle

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,120
at the time it came to us it was called

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,680
lavender it was given to us by a a kid

197
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,158
named sticky

198
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,560
lungs when he was living in Oregon it

199
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:14,439
was a kid from Georgia and I I still

200
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,439
actually speak to him sometimes but um

201
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,199
that's where it originally came from and

202
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,598
then over time I guess we figured out

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,319
that it was a purple

204
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,199
Urkle I'm I'm not ever uh you know I'm

205
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,158
not certain on the lineage of it if it

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,439
was actually a lavender or a purple urle

207
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:33,158
but the um purple Urkle that I'm using

208
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,759
now for um quirl is actually a purple

209
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:38,080
Urkle so there is a change I do still

210
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,080
have offer quirl but the mom is

211
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,560
different it still utilizes space dude

212
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,480
for the mail and it's it's just a

213
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:49,399
reliable selection of purple Urkle yes

214
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,000
yeah and um I know Chernobyl was a huge

215
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:56,519
hit it's one that I liked very lime soda

216
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,480
type uh stuff to it um do you know this

217
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:04,720
story on H what was the uh blood

218
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,519
wreck um blood wreck was a phenotype of

219
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,680
um train wreck and that came via um

220
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,919
dioxide okay it came through another guy

221
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:19,879
named Scotty and he had given it to

222
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:22,159
dioxide and um then we used it and um

223
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,200
the golden ticket and and well let's

224
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,679
start out with the golden ticket

225
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,759
phenotype soot type was found by Dany

226
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,958
from uplifted farms during testing

227
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:35,360
period okay before it was ever a release

228
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:38,838
strain and it was just a wonderful very

229
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,120
limey type flavor with a just a ton of

230
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,079
resin so we um kept that around and used

231
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,440
that later in life I've got that as

232
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,958
mother of my um Jil Bean lime and I've

233
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,480
got that available both regular and

234
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,039
feminized so that's pretty cool but

235
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,039
later on um the Clone fell into the

236
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:59,399
hands of um I'm not going to mention

237
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,480
names but he wasn't supposed to have the

238
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,078
clone and he decided to name it Slimer

239
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,800
so that you know people does he have a

240
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:08,199
lame little mustache is that that person

241
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,759
yeah okay and he renamed the golden

242
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,680
ticket to Slimer on his own yes yes so

243
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,958
it's actually the same phenotype it's

244
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,199
just a phenotype of golden I mean of I'm

245
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:21,719
sorry of Chernobyl

246
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,120
yeah all right now let's get into Mr

247
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,399
inspecta here which I know everybody's

248
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,320
stoked to see his smiling beautiful face

249
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,360
back but um so I wanted to talk a little

250
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,680
a little bit about like the ideas behind

251
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,680
bringing TGA back and what what

252
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,479
direction you know you wanted to bring

253
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,399
some of your moms in you and Jill

254
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,920
obviously talked at a collaborative

255
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,639
effort and figured out which moms in

256
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,120
your room would work best with theh

257
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,159
space dude so talk about what what some

258
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,879
of your ideas were behind some of these

259
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:57,278
uh strin you guys got coming out right

260
00:10:52,879 --> 00:11:02,120
um well I grew a I think it was uh Jesus

261
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,120
OG or Jesus OG yeah

262
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,639
Fus um and uh wasn't that a like a a

263
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,200
Hell's Angel OG cross to space

264
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,120
dude okay um I agree with that back in

265
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,040
the day and you know those plants just

266
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,919
had amazing Vigor and just you know it

267
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,319
it seemed like there was a lot of really

268
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:26,120
good traits that pushed forward on that

269
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,160
so I I I figured based on based on that

270
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,120
you know it would probably hybridize

271
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,278
pretty good with you know some of these

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,639
you know oddballs and you know um

273
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,519
heirlooms that you know we all have in

274
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,959
our collection so yeah you know that was

275
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,320
that was my my main draw to it what were

276
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,518
some of the first ideas that you had you

277
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,040
know when you were thinking about what

278
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,919
would cross well with space dude I mean

279
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,159
you know definitely like you know

280
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,679
KMD you know some of some of the

281
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,639
different ogs um some of the worked ogs

282
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:01,078
you know like

283
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:04,240
5150 um and then you know even stuff you

284
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:08,159
know that wasn't around back when uh TGA

285
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,759
was making a um you know space dude

286
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,240
hybrids like you know Skittles and oh

287
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,519
yeah and you know stuff like that you

288
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,039
know even Girl Scout cookies you know

289
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,560
yeah that's a good

290
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:25,120
point so you know definitely bring bring

291
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,439
some of the old into into you know in

292
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,679
with the new so have you come up with

293
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,639
any oh sorry go ahead Joel I I'm sorry

294
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,039
I'm I'm one of those that really loves

295
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,720
cookies so I'm really happy to have that

296
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,319
um cross with space dude I'm sure it's

297
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,639
gonna make something really pretty yeah

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,519
what was it so you had space queen mom

299
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,720
that you kept Jill what what what did

300
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,600
she smell like and and look like we

301
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,839
originally started with two space queen

302
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,680
moms that um we used for uh seeds um one

303
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:01,320
of them was um referred to as Tiny bomb

304
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:03,399
and was a phenotype that I chose before

305
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,399
they had ever flowered just based on

306
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,759
structure of the plant and she ended up

307
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,078
being an amazing plant great structure

308
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,399
but the um space bomb she had just or

309
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:14,838
tiny bomb she had just you know the bud

310
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,480
was just a little bit better we finally

311
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,120
figured out over time that if we just

312
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,959
vegged her a little bit longer then she

313
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,799
would just have you know beautiful thick

314
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,559
buds but in the beginning they had

315
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:27,039
started out really small and that's why

316
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:29,119
we had called her tiny bomb but so we

317
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,159
had both of those phenotypes and we were

318
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,399
were um offering seeds from both so one

319
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,360
was a space Gill and then one was was um

320
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,320
space bomb and after time we got rid of

321
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,159
the space Gill because it was more um it

322
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,879
was bigger buds it was you know nicer

323
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:48,600
crop but it was as resinous and

324
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,320
flavorful as the um space bomb it's just

325
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,440
super strong Cherry it was one of my

326
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:58,040
most favorites um to smoke just super

327
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,199
resinous and and super Cherry just

328
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,120
fabulous now did the space dude mail do

329
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,559
you know if it ever passed forward stuff

330
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,639
like cherry or is it usually just

331
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,799
tropical

332
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,519
fruit type stuff what does he like to

333
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,278
pass or tend to pass on some cherry but

334
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,839
for the most part one why he's been one

335
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:17,360
of my favorite males is he lets the

336
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,000
female expressed herself she you still

337
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,519
get the expression of the of whatever

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,559
female you crossed him to um with just a

339
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,720
little more hint of maybe a little

340
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:28,159
cherry or or a little more resin yeah

341
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,040
yeah I remember tiny bomb was really

342
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,919
really resinous too

343
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:36,000
short little resonance thing so with

344
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,919
that said which ones are you most

345
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,078
looking forward to out of the new stuff

346
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:45,599
Caleb well you know definitely like the

347
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:49,638
KMD Girl Scouts uh the the different uh

348
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,839
Skittles z85 yeah you know those

349
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,240
ones probably uh are top on my list I'm

350
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,399
interested in the hp13 one quite a bit

351
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,759
just because you know it's that mystery

352
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,639
clone that no one's allowed to touch see

353
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,120
smell that one will be really unique too

354
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,519
I think yeah and I think the the

355
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,919
combination with the space dude you know

356
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,399
will up up its uh you know its Frost

357
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:20,078
content and you know probably normalize

358
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,759
some of that HP 13 weirdness you know

359
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:26,278
yeah and you did do some stuff with um

360
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,600
GDP as well and purple Urkle which

361
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,278
obviously that's one that was already

362
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,120
established but with the GDP that's kind

363
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,679
of interesting you did both yeah I I

364
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,759
focused on the GDP just because it seems

365
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:44,198
to be a more refined type of you know

366
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:47,199
URL KKL plant yeah yeah did you get k91

367
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:50,198
in there I'm sure I

368
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:53,159
did okay and there's there is a Calo in

369
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,359
there yeah yeah got the Calo in there

370
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,519
that'll be interesting to see how it

371
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,639
compares to like the orange

372
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,679
velvet sister

373
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,318
what's that we've we've named that

374
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:07,039
strange jil's Twisted Sister that makes

375
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:10,039
sense that's a good name for it and then

376
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,439
um you got lemon party in there oh yeah

377
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:16,159

favorite yeah lemon party and Irene

379
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,120

380
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,039
yeah very very very much and like you

381
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,919

00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:51,639
really good yeah no kidding people be

391
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:55,360

393
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,480

about doing any feminized works I mean

395

you would go for uh feminized wise what

399
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,720
What would most interest you from the

400
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,439
TGA catalog to to pull feminized work of

401

I mean uh Jill and I have been talking

402
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:25,000

404
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,359

407
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,320
genetics and what you've been doing

408
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,839
aside from the space dude stuff the new

409
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,319

over there Jill um I have a lot of Jelly

411

412
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,480
different phenotypes of jelly beans so I

413
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,079
I hope people aren't confused by that

414
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,640
because I have like a jelly bean black

415
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:58,319

awesome most of those are available

419
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,640
regular and feminized um it hits both

420
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,000
sides Some people prefer regulars and

421
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,320
some people don't have the room and

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,798
prefer feminis so yeah I'm trying to

423
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,759
offer for both both sides of the fence

424
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,720
um right now I'm I'm just really excited

425
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:25,119

Jill the changes from one to two um the

569
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,960
first one was a hard

570
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,240
cover really nice like when you touched

571
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,000
it at

572
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,798
yeah and but the 2.0 just it's more

573
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,839
strains

574
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,558
updated okay so it was just more of what

575
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,599
you had released between one and two

576
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:15,200
yeah and this was

577
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:19,639
um Ed Ed Rosenthal actually is the one

578
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,679
who um edited and produced all of this

579
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,840
he did a good job yeah of course we've

580
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,159
come a long way with photography since

581
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,119
then yeah I think we were just talking

582
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,200
about Sputnik so there's Sputnik you can

583
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:34,879
see why people liked it so much oh yeah

584
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,080
it was beautiful pink yeah like um

585
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,919
magenta yeah and that was that was

586
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,199
really new back then people weren't used

587
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,679
to having those colors no and I think a

588
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,759
lot of people don't realize that like

589
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,880
that purple craze that came and went

590
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,558
with the with the kkes and stuff you

591
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,480
weren't really seeing pretty magenta

592
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:54,200
stuff like that that often would you

593
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,399
agree with that Caleb or did you have

594
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:02,240

605
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,480
The Offspring that's

606

00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,278
their own distinct sense they were they

614

626
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,278
with functionality of the camera like he

627
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:28,960
knew how to set the settings on the

628
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:31,319
camera I didn't more the one who would

629
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,679
set in the auto mode but I was much

630
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,079
better at um setting up shots than he

631
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,679
was yeah that collaborative effort with

632
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,240
your guys' pictures is is pretty

633
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,720
legendary though I remember on breed Bay

634
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,480
uh a lot of people trying to emulate

635
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,919
that yeah I I did get a lot of magazine

636
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,720
covers and and

637
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,679
articles with my photography and so did

638
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,519
he we both did

639
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,840
yeah my my favorite part of the te GA

640
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,960
era was you guys on breed Bay I would

641
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,319
say that was when you guys hit your

642
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,960
stride big I would

643
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:13,599
say so here is an old High Times

644
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,519
magazine from um is it may of 2007 yeah

645
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,639
May of

646
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,359
2007 okay super old who's on the cover

647
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,159
first article I had written for High

648
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,199
Times so there's a picture of the orange

649
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,679
velvet and the article was um the orange

650
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,798
wave female Growers perspective

651
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,278
so that was the whole start of the um

652
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,599
orange craze that we start you know that

653
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:38,798
we got into the industry with you need

654
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,678
to be doing more stuff like that now

655
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,879
more orange no more more articles

656
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,120
talking about stuff from the female

657
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,519
Growers perspective just because I mean

658
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,918
you're a fine representative of that

659
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,880
well unfortunately um with High Times

660
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:58,200
the crew has all changed um it probably

661
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,559
about 2016 through 2018 they kind of got

662
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,640
rid of their original crew and they've

663
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,000
gone with a new crew a bunch of younger

664
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,278
people which you know they're trying to

665
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,839
hit the younger crowd and I do

666
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,919
understand that but um they're not so

667
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:15,000
much interested in the Breeders or The

668
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,840
Growers anymore more of um influencers

669
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,679
and

670
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,119
and

671
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,600
um because the industry has become

672
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:25,158
legalized and so people are more into

673
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:26,759
the um instant gratification you can

674
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,559
just walk into a dispensary and grab

675
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,319
what you want yeah

676
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,960
you know that that doesn't carry the the

677
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:36,079
heart that um it carries when you grow

678
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,558
your own and I I I really wish more

679
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,960
people would get into growing their own

680
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,440
um it's it's so therapeutic to grow and

681
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,640
to touch the plants and have your hands

682
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,759
in the soil and and it's it's rewarding

683
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,559
when you you it's so surprising you know

684
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,240
you grow this little plant and it just

685
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,278
it grows into this big beautiful plant

686
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,798
and you have these buds on it and it's

687
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,278
sometimes it's just the satisfaction of

688
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,720
knowing that you've just created

689
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,720
something so beautiful and then you get

690
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,240
to cure it and smoke it and reap the

691
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,440
benefits of of all your hard work and

692
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,399
you always know what you've put in it so

693
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,159
you know you're not smoking whatever

694
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:11,639
you're not getting the chemicals and and

695
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,159
I know there's a lot of testing but a

696
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,600
lot of stuff still slips through on the

697
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,519
testing oh yeah i' I've learned about

698
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,439
how they dip it in hydrogen peroxide now

699
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,558
to beat the testing and sometimes

700
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,399
irradiate which was new to me that they

701
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:28,000
irradiate the weed to beat testing oh

702
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:30,599
x-ray style which is new to me I hate to

703
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,720
call any names out but you know the guy

704
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:37,759
SK um initials

705
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,798
um he was part of of a group that has a

706
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,720
it's called a remediation machine or

707
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:46,079
whatever so when they were growing weed

708
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,798
that would be moldy or subpar something

709
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,759
they couldn't sell couldn't pass testing

710
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:52,599
they would put it through the

711
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:53,798
remediation machine yeah so you know you

712
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,038
have to worry about those kinds of

713
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,599
things especially if you buy the

714
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,038
pre-rolls you're not you're not getting

715
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,319
buds that have been broken up you're

716
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,558
getting Sugar Leaf or not I'm sorry not

717
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,000
even Sugar Leaf you're getting fan

718
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,879
leaves you're getting whatever is at the

719
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,079
bottom of the bag yeah know it's it's

720
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,440
not

721
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,678
quality yeah and there's something to

722
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,720
say for like seeing people grow

723
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,399
something out that you've made you know

724
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,120
with seed wise I think all of us could

725
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,879
agree that's something really unique and

726
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,959
when you first start seeing that as a

727
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,720
someone who makes seeds it's it's it's a

728
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,558
whole another feeling absolutely and to

729
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,278
see their excitement and and joy when

730
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:30,599
they grow it out and it's beautiful and

731
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,679
they they feel like they've done such a

732
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,519
great job and they smoke it for the

733
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,278
first time and they're so happy and and

734
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:39,278
excited with their work yeah it's it's a

735
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,919
lot of fun it's it's great to see your

736
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,519
medicine help people with with physical

737
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,799
or mental issues and help them overcome

738
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,038
things and and like I said the growing

739
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,079
itself is therapeutic and definitely

740
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,599
helps people with anxiety and depression

741
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:56,480
and for

742
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,599
sure yeah I always know when I'm

743
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,360
depressed if my plants don't look good

744
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:03,398
they're always a very good uh uh

745
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:07,839
physical indicator of how my brain's

746
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:10,518
doing you know y yep I just get

747
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,519
depressed when my plants are

748
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,278
unhappy

749
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,038
reverse happen that way right yeah yeah

750
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:20,720
that's for sure especially when rooms

751
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:24,440
[ __ ] you know

752
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,839
fail always fun always fun depressing as

753
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,679
[ __ ] but the good thing about that is

754
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,480
you know you get to learn you you figure

755
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,080
out what it is that you've done wrong

756
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,480
what you could have done differently and

757
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,918
and that's the thing about growing you

758
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,798
can't write a book I mean you can write

759
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,360
a book about growing but you can't write

760
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,480
down everything that might come up

761
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,839
that's true yeah it's always going to be

762
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,759
different everybody's grow everybody's

763
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,398
um environment every strain and every

764
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,558
year might even be different you never

765
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:53,839
know what's going to happen yeah very

766
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:56,558
true yeah there's some rounds where I

767
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,918
can't even clone right you know like I

768
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,638
feel like I'm an idiot and have to to

769
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,000
start back from scratch on just cloning

770
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:04,479
but usually it lasts a month out of the

771
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,919
year and you know maybe if you really

772
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,639
paid attention to that it might be the

773
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,919
same same time of year every year it

774
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:13,558
might be something else going on yeah

775
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,399
like Mercury retrograde like Mercury
