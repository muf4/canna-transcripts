Syndicate welcome to reader Syndicate

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,239
I'm Matthew here with thousandfold and

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
today we are here with peaches and

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,280
thousand what are we going to be

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,878
discussing so we had Peaches on last

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,280
season to talk about extracts um in

25
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,159
general and today we have R to talk

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,439
Edibles because that is the other the

27
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:06,280
side of what peaches does um and yeah

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,239
very excited we've had a lot of demand

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,920
um a lot of people ask peaches you know

30
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,798
on the on the server all the time like

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,920
how she does this and that so naturally

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,400
we thought we'd have her on the show for

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,840
for this one um so before we got into it

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,640
though I just thought it would be cool

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,118
to break the ice a bit and ask peachers

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,478
about how her outdoor season

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:33,280
went actually you talk better broadly

38
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:35,560
paches yeah uh it went great actually

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,599
everything uh came off we had a

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,879
staggered Harvest uh from anywhere from

41
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:44,640
you know seven weeks out to the 11 weeks

42
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:47,239
for the sour and uh it went good we got

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,759
rained on a little bit but nothing got

44
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:55,478
moldy and the most exciting thing for me

45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,438
is I actually found my peach turps so um

46
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:00,920
from all the way through I had one

47
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:03,038
Barber red feno that had Peach turch she

48
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,560
smelled like it while she was

49
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,560
growing uh after harvest she smelled

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,598
like it and now that she's been hanging

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,319
and curing she still smells like it and

52
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:17,000
the other day I was smoking a joint and

53
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,598
I was like oh my goodness it tasted like

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,318
I ate a peach fruit

55
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,479
cup and it was shocking it had to wrap

56
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,479
my mind around the fact that I was not

57
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,518
eating a peach but I was smoking a joint

58
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,639
that tasted like peaches so I Love Weed

59
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,400
like that it was amazing and I managed

60
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:37,958
like I don't know we were three weeks

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,680
from Harvest or so maybe four months I

62
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,439
don't know she was fully budded when I

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,519
took the Clones I was so behind and uh

64
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,800
got those clones and they managed to not

65
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,400
only root but reved and now I have two

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,319
fully vegged plants and gallon pots

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,959
ready to go so very nice it was a good

68
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,679
year yeah maybe later on we can ask ask

69
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,400
you what what uh what Edibles those

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,760
might go into or what you think might be

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,000
a good fit for that

72
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,359
flavor def I have a couple things in

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,519
mind does that that kind of flavor carry

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,920
through to the

75
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,599
Edibles H I don't know yet because I've

76
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,598
never had one uh that had Peach chps I

77
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,000
know that like when we do the when I've

78
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,280
done the tincture the glycerin tinure

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,360
with strawberry banana flour it smells

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,239
like the strawberry banana flour those

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,159
tur

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,799
come through all the way through the

83
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:38,438
cooking process and everything those

84
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,519
those TS hold strong um unfortunately a

85
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,639
lot of turps burn off at different

86
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,680
temperatures so you'll lose them during

87
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:50,238
the edible making process um but uh so I

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,799
haven't I haven't tried the peach one

89
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
yet I'm interested to see I've got a

90
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,680
couple of peach treats that I make that

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,438
it would be interesting to see how they

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,599
add to all that I'd love to see if blue

93
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:06,078
works Works its way into in in like that

94
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,078
for flavor that would be cool see BL all

95
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,680
that

96
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,640
stuff yeah I'm glad Matt that you asked

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,239
that question I I realized as soon as I

98
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,399
said you know asked about the peach

99
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,000
thing yeah I had no idea either um about

100
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,519
how turps make their way through that

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,199
whole process um yeah but we will we

102
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,918
will be approaching that um maybe any

103
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,400
other highlights peaches from your

104
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,519
Harvest apart from your your Peach plant

105
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,478

106
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,560

that one uh they they all did really

109
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:44,560
well everything you know it was uh you

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,478
water every day and you put effort into

111
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,038
it every day and you pluck leaves and do

112
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,359
all this stuff and it it just came out

113
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,879
really good this year we have really

114
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,038
good tur profiles um on everything good

115
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,839
bud structure and absolutely no mold I

116
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,599
mean we got a couple times of rain rain

117
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,038
where it just rained and nothing broke

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,160
we had great structure on everything it

119
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:12,519
was it was just an overall good beer for

120
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,199
the Harvest good love to hear that yeah

121
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,839
it doesn't always go that way that's for

122
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,840
sure no not

123
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,359
always Matt how's your outdoor have this

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:30,360
G uh I just knocked it down all but

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:35,360
except one two three plants so the um

126
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,038
pry punch f2s are G to be harvested in I

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,199
don't know two weeks whenever I whenever

128
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:45,360
it's all dry and then I have the uh what

129
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,439
was it FL Flo no F1 der fler I have that

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,560
one in flour and it to be honest it

131
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:55,360
smells like cookies dead on you know

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,240
like dead on um yeah and then there's uh

133
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
I think I have some something from

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,639
Professor P out there too which is a

135
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,519
miss universe that got hit by the creamy

136
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,160
punch and yeah there's one more creamy

137
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,639
punch to harvest that's all black purple

138
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,039
and it was the only one that went that

139
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,240
extreme black purple but I I don't love

140
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,199
the TPS on it so I'm not sure that I'm

141
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,560
going to

142
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,680
do it's only one did wasn't extremely

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,199
Blu smelling out of all those can you

144
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,160
repeat that last bit Matt I think you

145
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,120
cut out for a little bit it was the the

146
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,759
the blackish purple one was the only one

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,519
that didn't have extremely blue turps

148
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,080
out of the creamy punch much more along

149
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:38,000
the silver Pearl so I'm not sure if I'm

150
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,680
going to even keep that one like or or

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,918
the seeds from it because I I'm really

152
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,560

166
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,840
you don't DEC carboxilate um you're not

167
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,960
going to get high you're not going to

168
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:36,079
get the same high because technically

169
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:37,878
thca does have benefits and it does

170
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,758
things for your system it helps with

171
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,240
pain and inflammation and stuff like

172
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,960
that but it doesn't create the high that

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,720
people want when they eat an edibl so if

174
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,439
you don't do that decarbox where you

175
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,039
convert it mostly over from thca to

176
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,680
THC um you're going to have a different

177
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:59,000
effect and people are going to think

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,319
your edible doesn't work um I have one I

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,839
have one little question here on TDA and

180
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,199
something that I've never really you

181
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,679
know I'm pretty ignorant about it if you

182
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,199
try to infuse a bunch of material

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,959
without decarbox silation I is there a

184
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,120
purpose for that like I mean you're sort

185
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:17,158
of implying that there might be a

186
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,439
function well yeah

187
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:24,319
because uh the thca is still a canabo we

188
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,158
still can take it and use it but it

189
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,000
doesn't allow us to get high it creates

190
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:33,918
a different High um and then it works

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,038
more um on your pain receptors than

192
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:39,319
anything so if you were going to make

193
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,120
yourself a TC a tincture you would just

194
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,640
know that you're not going to get that

195
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,519
same cerebral high that you would get

196
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,360
from one that's been decarbed as you

197
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,480
would you know that you're just going to

198
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,720
get some more pain relief um than you

199
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,720
would just getting

200
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,399
high just like if you had um a strain

201
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,920
that had more CBD in it and you didn't

202
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,600
decarb it um then you're still going to

203
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,559
be fighting that high you're not going

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
to get high because like when people

205
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,439
take Edibles they expect this you know

206
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,278
body high to get tired you get that

207
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,519
cerebral high as well as just like some

208
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:25,879
people get couch locked you know um and

209
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,200
so if you don't decarb it then you're

210
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:30,200
just you'll feel something but you're

211
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,040
just not going to get that locked

212
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,480
feeling where you're just like oh I'm

213
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:40,159
high yep that makes sense yeah yeah so

214
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,399
in terms of uh THC then and and that

215
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,360
conversion what kinds of you know yeah I

216
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,919
think in the outline you wrote

217
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,759
temperature and time like what kinds of

218
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,000
parameters do you think work well or

219
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:55,838
have worked for you um I like to keep it

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,839
at 200 degrees for at least an hour um I

221
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,279
like to use my uh convection oven

222
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,920
uh to do it but you can use your you can

223
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:08,399
use anything a double boiler a regular

224
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:12,199
oven uh whatever you got to use to warm

225
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,600
it up but I prefer I go for 200 once you

226
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,120
go over 200 once you hit the 210 stage

227
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,399
you start to convert it to

228
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,959
CBN um and so you don't want to do that

229
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,440
you want to you know keep it as THC so

230
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:29,599
you don't want to take it over 210 so I

231
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,800
go with 200 for at least an hour

232
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,920
um and that's with whether I'm doing

233
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:39,599
flour hash dry sift

234
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:42,838
rosin um anything a lot of people like

235
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,480
to uh put their oven on and then they'll

236
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,880
put the flour in there first and like

237
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,720
roast the flour to decarb it before they

238
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:54,480
put it in the oil or into a butter or

239
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,440
anything whatever carrier they're using

240
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,519
um I have found that when you do that

241
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,560
with the flow first it creates kind of

242
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:07,360
like a roasted flavor almost like when

243
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:09,879
you vape flour you know that uh how the

244
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,039
old you know like when you vape and you

245
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,078
get your stuff out of the thing it has

246
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,679
that weird popcorn smell to it yeah yeah

247
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:19,278
totally okay so if you do the flour

248
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,679
first in the oven you're going to get

249
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,919
that flavor with if you just put that

250
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,838
flour and oil in a mason jar with a lid

251
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,360
on it and put it in the oven you're

252
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,880
still going to decard that flour but you

253
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,360
will not have that

254
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:39,278
weird roasted taste so just so I'm clear

255
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,519
on it in this situation you are

256
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,480
decarbing and infusing at the same time

257
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,159
more or less yes M yep that's how I do

258
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,278
it like even with uh rosin I'll put the

259
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,600
rosin in the jar with the

260
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:56,838
oil um or whatever you're going to use

261
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,959
um you know if uh you're going to decarb

262
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,720
it into

263
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:04,000
butter you know I don't use a jar for

264
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,200
butter that's a whole different one

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,159
um but a lot of yeah all my decarbing

266
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,320
usually happens during the process of

267
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:14,159
infusing whatever I'm going to

268
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,560
use um to

269
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,120
make because previously I just thought

270
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,679
that there was no of you know no

271
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,959
difference quote unquote between

272
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,559
separating the stages or doing them

273
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,719
together but yeah that's a really good

274
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:30,359
point about the flavor or you know what

275
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,278
um doing the cup separately might you

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,759
know it might have consequences in those

277
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:35,759
in those

278
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:44,759
ways um I had another question here

279
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:48,480
which was does your approach change

280
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,639
depend what kind of uh material you are

281
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,600
decarbing like whether it's flour

282
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,519
whether it's an extract uh does anything

283
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,839
change for you not with the temperature

284
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,519
and time no it's all to you know cuz

285
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,680
it's all you're trying to get that THC

286
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,600
to convert so whether it's the flour

287
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:11,120
you're using or the concentrate it all

288
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,639
takes the same

289
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,799
process um the only thing that changes

290
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,560
uh that the only thing that's different

291
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:24,919
about all those ones is the when you use

292
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:27,838
leaf or flower you get more of that weed

293
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:30,759
taste yes yes that's right and I think

294
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,040
yeah well yeah that's because people I

295
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,039
think people have asked you before I've

296
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,159
seen them um asking you like how do you

297
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,919
how do you minimize that right and I

298
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,480
think this was your one of

299
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:45,679
your yeah it was one of the questions

300
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:49,240
from um somebody who was

301
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,519
it just over the last day look yeah they

302
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:58,919
uh posted about it in the

303
00:13:52,519 --> 00:14:02,039
um let me see oh appy Hills Hills yeah

304
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:05,159
um I would say it using hasher rosin

305
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:08,039
makes the least wheaty um hash and rosin

306
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:11,120
it's more spicy than it is that weed

307
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:15,120
flavor um because I can't stand the weed

308
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:19,078
flavor like I it'll make me gag I love

309
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,879
it horrible I can't stand it I think it

310
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,838
makes everything way better no there's

311
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,039
times when I'm like out of habit you

312
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,519
know you cook stuff and I I try to taste

313
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,078
things to make sure they taste right if

314
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,799
I'm making brownies or a cake or

315
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,719
something like that and every time I'll

316
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,958
go to taste the brownie but and then I

317
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,040
regret it

318
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,439
immensely every single time this is

319
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,319
quite random but do you remember me and

320
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,639
Matt talking to you about pandang that

321
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,000
that leaf from Southeast

322
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,639
Asia yes I do weirdly I think that kind

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,639
of Aroma would actually work really well

324
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,000
with yeah I might have to try actually

325
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,839
now now that I'm say I might have to go

326
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,958
and try it I think you should because

327
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,000
that's that's more on the side of like

328
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:04,198
vanilla coconut

329
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,278
already those flavors might might

330
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,679
actually kind of work with with the

331
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:11,759
flavor of so

332
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:16,120
good it's also green it's already green

333
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:18,879
as well anyway sorry but total

334
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,720
tent um in this I did want to ask Matt

335
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,360
as well another tangent Matt how much

336
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,278
Edibles have you made like how much

337
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,759
experience have do you have like making

338
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:30,958
stuff Dex I've done it like three times

339
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:34,039
total I have a a machine we bought um

340
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,039
supposed to it's called is the the

341
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:39,078
purple one no no

342
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,159
it's God tip my tongue but it's this

343
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:43,758
little machine that decars it for you

344
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:47,039
and makes like I don't I don't even know

345
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,959
what we never used it um yeah I've only

346
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,159
done it a few times and the way I decarb

347
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,838
is in the oven done it that way but I've

348
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,838
made awful animal awful I'd let it burn

349
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,079
up and it was

350
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,360
horrible which is not good not good at

351
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,000
all

352
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,318
really stunk up the house too that was

353
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,078
the other hard part was how much it

354
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:06,559
stinks up the house when you do it wrong

355
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:08,198
I don't know if it does does it stink

356
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,198
that bad when you do it

357
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:14,599
correct uh it stinks no matter

358
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,919
what yeah it's just that it's that smell

359
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,680
it Wass even if you put it in a jar with

360
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:24,278
the lid on it you still get some

361
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:26,399
smell makes sense yeah see weirdly it's

362
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,679
the smell of it puts me off more

363
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,159
especially if I've been with it like if

364
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:34,318
sitting with it all day then it it does

365
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:36,919
start to get to me

366
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:40,318
lot

367
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:42,360
yeah okay that's cool okay so was there

368
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:44,000
anything else about decar oxolation that

369
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,959
you wanted to talk about

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,078
peaches no I think that covers it

371
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,719
honestly it's really a simple process

372
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,120
it's just I think sometimes people

373
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,560
forget to do it sometimes people think

374
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,799
that rosin is already decarbed because

375
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,958
you press it at a higher temp but it's

376
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:03,159
not on

377
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,438
for it to happen um so it's important

378
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:07,359
that if you are making Edibles that you

379
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,279
take the time to do this because

380
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,000
otherwise you're gonna you're G to be

381
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,038
sorry yeah

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,798
cool and I think something that you did

383
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:17,959
say that I'll just repeat or highlight

384
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:20,558
again the different canono do actually

385
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,640
have different uh points at which they

386
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:28,558
convert so yes um I think you mentioned

387
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:31,160
CBD is it lower or is it higher or um

388
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,480
not sure about the exact temperature of

389
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,120
what when it converts to CBD I'd have to

390
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:41,120
look that up um I do know that it two at

391
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:43,839
210 is when THC starts to convert to

392
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,839
CBN and that's the one that gets the red

393
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,399
color and it makes you more tired than

394
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:53,000
anything

395
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,519
um sorry yep yeah that's that's what you

396
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,279
get when you like uh you know a lot of a

397
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,038
lot of people will do their already

398
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,918
Vaped Bud right

399
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,158
iag that's a lot of CBN right yeah

400
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,919
exactly or like older weed that's been

401
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,080
around like sitting around for a year it

402
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,960
contains higher levels of the CBN

403
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,798
because it's aged and it's converted

404
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,798
over time and

405
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,079
oxidization

406
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,400
yeah um okay well the next interesting

407
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,720
topic is actually going to be carriers

408
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,400
and this is this is is interesting to me

409
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,720
so different fats or different oils have

410
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,200
different capacities to absorb or

411
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,400
hold um the can

412
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,000
canono um peaches yeah what what do you

413
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,880
have to say on this

414
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,759
one um yeah when you're going to make

415
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,240
edibles you want to use something that

416
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:50,879
contains fat as your uh either fat or

417
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,679
alcohol um because you need that fat to

418
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,400
help transport it into your system when

419
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,240
you digest it and all that that's part

420
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,679
of what happens in your body body is it

421
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,200
it latches onto that fat Mo molecule and

422
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,640
that allows it to be absorbed and taken

423
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,519
into your liver where it's processed and

424
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,759
allows you to actually get High um so

425
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:17,558
it's important to use a butter a milk a

426
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:21,119
cream um you know you can use the MCT

427
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:24,079
oil because it's a medium train chain

428
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,239
triglyceride um which it makes it easy

429
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,879
for you to absorb it so it makes it a

430
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,940
little quick more quickly bio available

431
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,320
to your system

432
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,519
[Music]

433
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:39,240
um and then like the alcohol well we all

434
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:42,400
know alcohol absorbs

435
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,558
THC um oh yeah that one I didn't have on

436
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,280
the list yeah that's you know like well

437
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:51,599
I people so you know now the whole

438
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:54,839
conflict between RSO and Foo um you know

439
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:59,000
nobody makes RSO with napsa not that I'm

440
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:02,439
aware of anymore um Even Rick I'm pretty

441
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,200
sure made his with um grain alcohol you

442
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,840
know that's what people had access to so

443
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,759
I A lot of times refer to it as RSO and

444
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,158
have to be told well no you don't make

445
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,759
it with Napa you make it with alcohol so

446
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:19,600
it's considered Foo which is full

447
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:22,558
extract cannabis oil yeah so you know we

448
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:25,558
have to be terminology correct

449
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,558
sometimes

450
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,519
definitely um so you mentioned that some

451
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,439
of what distinguishes these carriers are

452
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,119
like the capacity to hold and store you

453
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,000
know the canabo and then also the way in

454
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,239
which they make those canono available

455
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,119
to your system once you've ingested them

456
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,079
um what do you use the different ones

457
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,079
for or do you use do you use like a

458
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,079
range of them or do you have you kind of

459
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,519
gravitated towards you know a couple of

460
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:57,558
them um does it matter on your

461
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:02,319
application um I I have different ones

462
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:04,918
that ief f for certain ways um like when

463
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm going to make a tincture um I love

464
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:13,440
to use the MCT oil um because it it's

465
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:16,519
just it's a great carrier um and then uh

466
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,960
the milk or cream works great if you

467
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,400
want to make uh flavored coffee um ice

468
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,880
cream

469
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,480
puddings um you know anything that

470
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,520
contains milk that you don't want to

471
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,919
have to try to substitute oil in for you

472
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:32,798
know because a lot of people have you

473
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,120
know make oil and then they will

474
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:41,000
substitute it in for something um the

475
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:44,239
butter I love that for your basic cookie

476
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,319
recipes um brownies work great with the

477
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,400
oil because you always put oil in

478
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,879
brownies you know

479
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,559
every brownie recipe calls for like a

480
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,240
third cup of oil as it is so you're not

481
00:21:53,558 --> 00:22:00,839
adding anything extra to that um and and

482
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
then uh now when you want to do

483
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,759
chocolate a lot of people like to put

484
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,400
the butter into chocolate which is great

485
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:10,200
you can make a grap gach with chocolate

486
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,320
and all that but butter in chocolate

487
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,679
will cause it to expire faster so that's

488
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:18,839
why I recommend uh using cocoa butter if

489
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,480
you're going to infuse chocolate or a

490
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,959
coconut oil um but some people have

491
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,278
coconut allergies so that's when you

492
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,278
want to look into if you got somebody

493
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:31,359
with a coconut allergy you can use

494
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:34,759
avocado oil um and then you can use the

495
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,038
cocoa butter um also and then it goes

496
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,038
into the chocolate and you're not adding

497
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,240
anything to the chocolate to make it

498
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:44,158
different chocolate already is cocoa

499
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,839
butter um and I think people forget

500
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,240
about cocoa butter a little bit because

501
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:51,759
it's a solid that you have to melt um

502
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,558
but it still will Infuse and works great

503
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,558
to put into

504
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,960
chocolate very nice nice

505
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:04,519
you know and then butter you can cook

506
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,199
with on the stove uh avocado oil too

507
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:10,480
when you infuse it you can use it to

508
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:13,038
dress your salads make a salad dressing

509
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,880
um you know season your vegetables it

510
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,240
just depends on how you want to consume

511
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,000
it or eat

512
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,000
it yeah that Mak sense yep

513
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:26,918
absolutely um I just trying to

514
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,558
think anything else anything else about

515
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,320
like uh making your your choice about

516
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:33,759
which carrier um beyond what you've

517
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,399
mentioned already any anything else that

518
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,440
comes to

519
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,519
mind um

520
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,080
well I would have to say that in my

521
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,119
opinion butter has the strongest taste

522
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,639
out of all the carriers like when you

523
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:54,199
put cuz butter probably it takes the

524
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:56,759
longest and to make and I think uh you

525
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,240
end up with more of that weed flavor in

526
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,480
the butter so if you're trying trying to

527
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,798
stay away from that that might not be

528
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,360
something you want to make and use yeah

529
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:09,599
I will say that in my you know my my

530
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:12,158
personal experience that is the one that

531
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,839
um that is the one that has the the the

532
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,440
greatest tendency to make me like uh I

533
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,079
don't know just feel quite grossed out

534
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,480
just by being around it all day um it's

535
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:25,119
butter and and weed for sure because

536
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,798
it's so it's already so rich on its own

537
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,319
butter you know when you're heating it

538
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,079
up combining it with the musk of

539
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:36,599
cannabis is just like full on very

540
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:38,839
potent that's for sure yeah yeah okay no

541
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,359
that's that's excellent I had one this

542
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,918
is more of a tangent because I know this

543
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,479
is an Edibles episode but if you were

544
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:48,720
making a topical what what kind of like

545
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,599
what kinds of Base would you what kind

546
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,798
of a Bas would you use for a

547
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:56,079
topical um I like to use a mixture of

548
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,359
shea butter and mango

549
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:03,480
butter interesting

550
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:06,879
okay yep I do a a 5050 mix of those two

551
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:12,120
and then uh I also use

552
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,559
a uh with those two Butters I use a

553
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,439
Jehovah

554
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:23,158
oil um an MCT oil and then

555
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,159
glycerin and then I use vitamin E as a

556
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:28,480
preservative yeah I was I was fully

557
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,959
considering making some for my

558
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,399
girlfriend for Christmas she's got like

559
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,120
sore neck and stuff but I I might have

560
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:38,599
to wait I might have to like um follow

561
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,798
up on this with you and and get a bit

562
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,719
more info I'm down to try it and maybe

563
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,759
another episode too unlike topicals

564
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,839
perhaps yeah most definitely and if

565
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:51,278
you'd like I'll send you my recipe the

566
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:53,199
actual breakdown of the um weights and

567
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,839
stuff and it comes out really good it's

568
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,880
not too greasy I've got it down to where

569
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,398
it's more of a cream type it's it's a

570
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,600
whipped cream uh and it's pretty

571
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,439
effective so if you'd like I'll send

572
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,918
that

573
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,558
to yeah absolutely yeah I would really

574
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,759
appreciate that you you can't you don't

575
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:14,319
get high of it right like my girlfriend

576
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:17,960
does not like does not like I don't I

577
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:20,519
use it and I don't um I've never had

578
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,558
anybody tell me they did I did have a

579
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:29,200
lady who used one of my bath teas and

580
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:32,798
salts and fell asleep in the bathtub

581
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,038
cuz she got so relaxed she didn't drown

582
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,000
no she didn't drown but she fell asleep

583
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,119
in there her husband had to come find

584
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,558
her now this is making me want to like

585
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,918
make some some topical cream and and try

586
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:47,558
rubbing it on like in like the inside

587
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,840
and stuff to see if it will get in me

588
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:52,319
anywhere but I don't know also just I

589
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,839
assume that it's like a localized thing

590
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,480
right if you rub it on your arm most of

591
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:58,839
it will not get into a bloodstream so

592
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,038
yeah yeah I don't I think it would take

593
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,119
a lot to actually you know get all the

594
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,319
way into your bloodstream and to you

595
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,918
know I do know they do know make those

596
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:10,918
topical cannabis patches now so I know

597
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,440
it has to get into there some to some

598
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,080
extent but I don't think it's in there

599
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,798
enough to like if you it was like eating

600
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:20,000
an edible where you'd be like oh [ __ ]

601
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,200
I'm high

602
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,398
yeah because she would be really mad if

603
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,159
I gave it to her and then she got high

604
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:28,158
off it like she'd be pissed I could

605
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,440
understand so

606
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,360
I've missed the I think I've missed the

607
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,880
window to make it for for Christmas but

608
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,439
I'll do it for another

609
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,900
time well Valentine's is coming up yeah

610
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,480
there's that too

611
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,278
[Laughter]

612
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,599
easy okay um if we're happy with the

613
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,519
carriers you had another point you did

614
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,719
already touch on it but did you want to

615
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,399
go into the glycerin tincture again in

616
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,960
more detail

617
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,239
maybe uh yeah we can do that for sure

618
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,880
what so what do you use this for because

619
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,120
I've never really myself I've never

620
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,278
really heard of this what is this

621
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:07,558
glycerin is awesome because glycerin is

622
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,919
water

623
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:14,759
soluble and uh so you can also and you

624
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,320
can use it as a topical um you know it's

625
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,558
a hrant for your skin it helps keep the

626
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,439
moisture in uh that's why I use it in

627
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:25,960
the lotion and then also it doesn't

628
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,200
affect your the insulin as much as

629
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,798
sugars do um there's some research they

630
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,880
did about that um so the cool thing

631
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,639
about the glycerin is that you can use

632
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,120
it like I like to use it to make gummies

633
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,120
I prefer it to make gummies way more

634
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:46,359
than oil oil to make gummies is a pain

635
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:49,558
in the ass um so glycerin makes great

636
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:52,519
gummies it uh you can mix it with just

637
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,558
rubbing alcohol and use it as a topical

638
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,599
um you can drink it straight you can put

639
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,519
it in your coffee you can put it in your

640
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:01,879
soda you can put it in anything you can

641
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:06,240
drink it straight if you don't mind the

642
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:09,320
taste um so that's what was you know

643
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,240
awesome about it the reason uh we chose

644
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:15,558
a organic vegetable glycerin and we

645
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:20,558
first did this recipe when uh Buckshot

646
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:24,879
was on uh fentanyl Soma

647
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:27,798
celibre uh LCA all those gnarly drugs

648
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,320
they had him on for his back pain uh

649
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:33,839
when he went to get off those we

650
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:38,439
developed this glycerin and uh it works

651
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,918
uh it just takes time you you have to uh

652
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,558
it's not one of like a lot of people

653
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,159
think with the glycerin uh you either do

654
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,639
it like you would do a normal decarb or

655
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,159
you have to let it sit for six months

656
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,960
which is one way to do it but nobody

657
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,799
wants to wait around for six months to a

658
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,919
year for your stuff to

659
00:29:53,798 --> 00:30:00,918
infuse right um so he

660
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,960
uh had some

661
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,200
research with uh that he had done and it

662
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,880
was skunk Farms put out a article about

663
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,240
how to do the glycerin

664
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,159
tincture and uh

665
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,399
so uh in the middle of learning how to

666
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,880
make all this is that that's how he

667
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,000
figured out how to do the formula so

668
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,000
that you can actually extract the THC

669
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,759
into the

670
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,278
glycerin um and so our ratio is you get

671
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:34,798
a gallon of Glycerin and you can use

672
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,480
anywhere from 4 to 6 oz of flour it kind

673
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,000
of depends like you know if you have big

674
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,200
buds that are bigger then you're going

675
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,119
to

676
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,720
um uh want to use 4 ounz per gallon but

677
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:49,639
if you have the smaller ones you can get

678
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,440
away with six um it's important that

679
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,000
glycerin poures way better when it's

680
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,798
warmer so if you warm it up before you

681
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,159
pour it over the flour um it works

682
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:03,759
better and then uh what I use is a it's

683
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,600
a little induction burner thing you know

684
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:10,558
it only works with certain pans and you

685
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:13,480
put it on there and you set it um to run

686
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:17,240
at 190 to 200 same thing you don't want

687
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,399
it to be going over 200 and you run it

688
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,599
um on the heat for 4 hours and then you

689
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,678
pull it off and you put it into an ice

690
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,158
bath to cool it down and if you don't

691
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,000
have ice or you don't want to buy the

692
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,480
ice you can let it it at room

693
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,440
temperature but it takes longer um so

694
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,599
you let it cool down and once it cools

695
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,759
down to room temp you put it back on and

696
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,599
you heat it up for 4 hours again and you

697
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,038
repeat that process six

698
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:47,638
times and during that time you keep

699
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:50,398
stirring it um frequently so it doesn't

700
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:51,638
burn to the bottom and you're you know

701
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,518
making it kind of like when you're

702
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:55,879
washing hash you're you're forcing the

703
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,880
glycerin to go through the buds and you

704
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,080
know absorb through and pick up all the

705
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,039
THC and so you do that for six times of

706
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:08,960
warming and Cooling and then you strain

707
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:14,319
it um I found some nut bags for making

708
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:16,960
nut milk um they're like 200 Micron and

709
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:21,240
a couple other 180 I think

710
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,798
Micron and 100 Micron and you use those

711
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,159
and you strain it through and uh you've

712
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,918
got glycerin that you could put in your

713
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,278
bathtub because it's water soluble so

714
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,519
you could take a bath where the THC

715
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:38,240
actually goes into the water and doesn't

716
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,079
float has oil on top that's wild that is

717
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,759
wild yeah and then it is it's pretty

718
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:47,359
awesome and we've actually had it tested

719
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:51,638
and it tested to where we got 1,000

720
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:53,398
milligrams of THC per ounce of Glycerin

721
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:57,359
at that

722
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:59,918
ratio and you know so it it makes good

723
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,199
medicine and you can put that right into

724
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:06,720
a drink too and uh you know or like uh

725
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,480
those Sparkling Waters um I also put it

726
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,240
in just a bottle and I'll flavor it like

727
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,679
lauran has some great candy

728
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,079
flavorings um yeah that you can put into

729
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,759
it and then you got a watermelon

730
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:21,278
flavored tinure or cherry or grape or

731
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:24,359
whatever flavor you

732
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:27,880
want so just to be really clear here do

733
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:30,359
you ever use it alongside a carrier oil

734
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:34,720
or no it's it's instead of most of the

735
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:36,359
time I use it with uh oil um when I make

736
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,200
my uh

737
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,119
topicals because my topicals have an oil

738
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,319
and glycerin in it and so I like to use

739
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,879
both of those

740
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,240
medicated into the

741
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,080
batch yeah gotcha but that's the

742
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,120
exception generally it's like uh like

743
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,798
you were saying because I guess the the

744
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,199
ultimate product is like a yeah

745
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,119
waterbased thing so you want to use

746
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,600
glycerin for that instead of of the the

747
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,918
oil but yeah okay no I get you now

748
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,158
that's cool no thanks for telling us

749
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,839
about that I don't think I've ever heard

750
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:12,000
of yeah that's a new one for

751
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:15,440
me yeah it's a pretty awesome product to

752
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
have have you seen it used uh any other

753
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,720
ways that you youve came to try out

754
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,960
yourself oh yeah I was a saltwater taffy

755
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,959
you use glycerin to make saltwater taffy

756
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,838
so I'm in I just haven't had the time to

757
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,199
make it from scratch yet but that's one

758
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,918
thing I haven't made yet that I've been

759
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,480
interested in trying it

760
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,679
in

761
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,519
yum right I just need a Taffy puller

762
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,000
yeah right everybody's got one of those

763
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,599
laying around right just right there

764
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,599
simple Taffy

765
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:51,719
puller um okay or anything else about

766
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,280
glycerin otherwise we can move on no I

767
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:58,199
think that's it on that one oh if you're

768
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:01,400
going to uh uh a lot of times not only

769
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:03,598
like when you if you want to press the

770
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,039
like if you use the flour to press the

771
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,640
flour to get the glycerin out of it um I

772
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,000
like to use a wine press back in the day

773
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:15,319
I did have to use a potato racer cuz I

774
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,519
didn't have a wine press um but those

775
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,119
are the two pieces of equipment that

776
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,480
come in handy when you want to like you

777
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,280
know extract anything like if you're

778
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,719
using oil even or even if it's glycerin

779
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,320
oil butter and you want to strain your

780
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:34,919
Leaf out and squish it so it comes out

781
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,920
uh I recommend a potato racer or a wine

782
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,079
press excellent info a lot

783
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:46,439
easier how about sunflower lein or

784
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,358
however you say that um i' I use this I

785
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,039
I I never questioned it I I just read

786
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,838
about it early on and it seemed to work

787
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,039
never never tried it

788
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:57,838
without yeah there's the whole thing

789
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,838
that helps you uptake the THC there's

790
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,078
that part of it that it makes it more

791
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,679
bioavailable and helps it carry into

792
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,560
your system the other thing about it is

793
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:10,000
that is the key if you want to make

794
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,000
gummies with

795
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,760
oil uh okay let me let me pause you here

796
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,239
because what you said was was already

797
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,520
something that I was quite interested in

798
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,078
which is at least the initial point

799
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:25,000
which was

800
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:28,160
um have you have you side by side tried

801
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,679
uh an edible with with and without out

802
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,000
and like have you seen the difference in

803
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:34,838
uptake because for me you know you know

804
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,159
typically you hear people making Edibles

805
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:37,960
especially back in the day when we just

806
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,879
baking you know brownies and whatnot

807
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,679
people would say that it took ages to to

808
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,920
kick

809
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:46,399
in um but when I when I have used

810
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,800
Lin I feel like it's it it kicks in

811
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,519
really quick but that's just anecdotal

812
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,800
like have you seen you know yourself

813
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:57,079
this

814
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:00,000
effect I honestly I haven't experimented

815
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,800
with myself cuzz the only time I use it

816
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,480
is when I make

817
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:09,519
gummies um gotcha okay okay so I would

818
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:14,240
I'll experiment on Buckshot

819
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:17,440
though yes I like this I like

820
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,439
poor all

821
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,599
right

822
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,759
captive yeah sorry go

823
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,160
ahead sorry I was just making jokes at

824
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,720
shot expense um gummies talking about

825
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:35,838
gummies with lesser than yeah um well

826
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,719
cuz it the not only does it help with

827
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:42,358
the hive but it um it's an

828
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:44,799
emulsifier so if you want to use oil yes

829
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,039
to make gummies you need an emulsifier

830
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,400
or you're going to have a horrible mess

831
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:54,239
it's no fun like oh my god I've had

832
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,440
horrible experiences with the oil and

833
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:59,439
the gummies so um you the oil just like

834
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,559
starts leaking out of them is that right

835
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,440
if you don't do

836
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:07,639
it out yep it will leech

837
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,318
out and so not only do you lose that and

838
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,519
then they like to mold easier it's just

839
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:15,519
it's just

840
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,440
gross um but I found uh they sell it in

841
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,318
liquid and powder I've only worked with

842
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,519
the liquid but I did find out a key with

843
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,960
the liquid sunflower was that I had to

844
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:28,039
let it bloom in the water like gelatin

845
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,280
before I used it cuz otherwise sometimes

846
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:34,880
it would Clump up um interesting that's

847
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,800
a good tip yeah it it took me a couple

848
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,280
times to figure it out but if you let it

849
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,280
Bloom the liquid Bloom um then you don't

850
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,040
have that issue and then I use it when I

851
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,560
made uh I prefer to make like I said my

852
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,400
gummies with glycerin but there's times

853
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:53,119
when I've had to use oil um sometimes

854
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,680
I've had to use alcohol just cuz that's

855
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:00,280
what I've had on hand and that sunflower

856
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:02,000
leathan helps with uh the oil one

857
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,079
immensely I just had to make one with

858
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,480
oil the other day and they came out

859
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,000
perfect you couldn't even tell they were

860
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,000
any different than the ones I made with

861
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,239
glycerin great

862
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,519
tip um yeah because for me like I

863
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,160
usually just make a big batch of oil at

864
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,920
the start of the year you know every

865
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:27,118
year and I just historically I've always

866
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,519
used lissan and um

867
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,200
yeah seems to seems to be good yeah let

868
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,920
me let us know if you get to experiment

869
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,799
with

870
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:39,039
buck I will tell us how it

871
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,240
goes okay anything else about that that

872
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,000
additive it's a good tip who haven't

873
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:45,559
heard it for sure no I mean you could

874
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,358
use it you don't have to just use it in

875
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:49,679
the gummies you like you use it in your

876
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,960
oil you can use it in anything to help

877
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,199
with that um it's supposed to be the

878
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,679
same thing like you know if you eat

879
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,879
mango it helps enhance the high it's

880
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,358
that same

881
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,599
idea actually this is a good one for

882
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,920
people to go try uh comment down below

883
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,200
if you have tried leathan and if you

884
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,760
especially if you've gotten to do a side

885
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,799
by side of some kind I'm I'm definitely

886
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,319
curious

887
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,160
um okay so you had a point here about

888
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,279
making full spectrum oil we kind of

889
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:21,639
talked about it already is there

890
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,599
anything to add PES to um well I I

891
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:26,960
recommend um if you're going to be

892
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,838
making that if you can afford it and

893
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,000
get it um I like to use uh it's by

894
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:36,000
extractohol and it's 190 proof uh it's

895
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,599
sugar

896
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,358
cane made from sugar cane and uh it's

897
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,000
organic um but I know everybody has

898
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:46,440
different budgets and stuff but the

899
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,280
higher proof you can use the better

900
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,000
because then you're getting a better

901
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:55,720
extraction of just the THC and less of

902
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,039
the chlorophyll and all that stuff um

903
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,239
the other thing when making it uh the

904
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,679
longer you let it soak the more

905
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,318
chlorophyll you're going to have in

906
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:10,078
there um you actually alcohol works very

907
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:13,519
quick at uh dissolving THC so you don't

908
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,000
have to let it um sit for hours you cut

909
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:16,920
out for a little bit in the middle of

910
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,760
that can you say that again that last

911
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,639
sentence uh yeah that

912
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:28,000
uh the longer you let the uh cannabis

913
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:29,559
sit in the uh alcohol the more

914
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,559
chlorophyll you're going to get out of

915
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:36,559
it uh the alcohol is very effective at

916
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:39,078
dissolving THC and so it doesn't have to

917
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,480
sit in there for hours at a time just to

918
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:46,280
get the THC it can just be I think like

919
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,400
the minimum is 5 minutes um and you'll

920
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,440
have your extract and then you can you

921
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,318
know

922
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,039
strain and uh get rid of it and that

923
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,679
stuff is supposed to be dabbable if you

924
00:41:54,039 --> 00:42:00,759
do a 5 minute

925
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:03,318
scratched um so I like to do it let it

926
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,800
set for you know 15 minutes to an hour

927
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:09,318
in the alcohol and then strain it out um

928
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,440
the other thing with making it is you

929
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:15,759
can do uh what we term as stacking a

930
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,599
batch which is where you put your 4 to 6

931
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,839
oz of weed into a gallon of alcohol you

932
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,960
soak it let it do its thing you strain

933
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:27,920
it and then you add another 4 to 6 oz of

934
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,280
weed to that same Al alcohol and you let

935
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,159
it sit and extract it and then you

936
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,880
strain it and go from there and then you

937
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:38,480
get a stacked batch because you can't

938
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,800
put 12 oz of flour into one gallon

939
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,240
alcohol it doesn't work it's too much

940
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,920
your ratio is off but if you do it in a

941
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:50,838
stacked batch you could get a stronger

942
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:54,440
batch and uh not have to use as much

943
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:56,838
alcohol um also make sure when you're

944
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,480
making it you use a thermomet ometer to

945
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,799
keep track of your temperature um you

946
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,318
don't want it going above the 200 Mark

947
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,240
uh all the same conversion stuff like

948
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:12,480
with decarb and all that um then you

949
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:16,639
don't want it to burn uh and then uh

950
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,519
same thing using uh the wine press to

951
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:23,719
get it all out of the material and the

952
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:26,318
nut bags to strain it um I even there's

953
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,558
even we even use those uh gold cof

954
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:31,759
filters as a double strainer on top of

955
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,760
the nut bags it's like I don't know five

956
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,880
times filtered um and that the bottom is

957
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,440
the 25 U

958
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:45,079
screen underneath the nut bags and then

959
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:48,280
you'll get some very very clean um full

960
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:53,559
extract cannabis oil from that and it'll

961
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:56,480
be uh at about I would say 80%

962
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:59,359
THC um at that ratio if you make make it

963
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,679
like that that means like for every gram

964
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:05,838
you have an estimate of 80% of that gram

965
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:08,639
is THC so when you're making an edible

966
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:14,440
and you use one gram of that FICO you

967
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:14,440
can say okay well that's 800 mg in that

968
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:21,598
batch there is yeah I kind of one of one

969
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,680
of the sections in here that we wanted

970
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,079
to talk speak to was dosing and and

971
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:28,558
potency um was there anything else to

972
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:30,200
add to the extract oil otherwise I

973
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,720
thought maybe that's a good segue into

974
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:35,239
talking about like nope you know how how

975
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:40,279
you measure or estimate your do that's

976
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,279
