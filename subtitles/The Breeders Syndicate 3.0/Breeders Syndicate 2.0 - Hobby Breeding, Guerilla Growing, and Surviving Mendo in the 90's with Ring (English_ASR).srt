were discussing like this whole podcast

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,659

know and and bring bring a little bit of

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,739
that to like the discourse or whatever

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,478
right so

31
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,199
um so we're gonna talk about world

32
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:24,200
problems

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,659
my buddy is one of the people that I've

34
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,920
talked about uh all kinds of stuff for a

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,140
long time we live in the same small

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,299
little town uh we both come from the

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,739
Midwest like homie said

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,600
um he's actually been out here probably

39
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,419
four years longer than me or something

40
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,839
like that so over a quarter century and

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,879
so we've kind of both seen uh you know

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,380
like a lot of the different eras that I

43
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,938
think people would consider I don't know

44
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,879
if you want to consider him legendary or

45
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,859
just old

46
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,899
you know but also when we were talking

47
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,578
last show about like a lot of hobbyist

48
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,320
reading and a lot of multi-stage

49
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,078
breeding and learning about your plants

50
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,879
uh Rings is someone that has been you

51
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,840
know basically when we when you first

52
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:12,479
got here in the 90s that was the way it

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,080
wasn't a clone world it was a seed world

54
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:20,878
right yeah yeah I don't even remember

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,860
any popular clones for quite a while you

56
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,679
know when I got here it was all seed

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,780
you'd hear about some indoors

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,980
here and there you'd see little batches

59
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,318
of indoor

60
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:32,759
here and there but there's a couple

61
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,299
lights

62
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:38,399
you know little bits yeah

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,840
and you know so there's an aspect there

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,700
where

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,159
um nowadays people view the kind of

66
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:47,219
breeding like that used to be done

67
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,079
around Mendo a lot just to have beans uh

68
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,419
something sort of mysterious

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,519
right well you know Rings basically

70
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,399
never left that era

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,319
the sense of uh he always he has been

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,300
breeding kind of for what he likes

73
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,818
plants he likes things that interest him

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,379
you know regular breeding no feminized

75
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,899
reversals or anything like that maybe

76
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:09,000
some accidents now and again

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,780
um and just looking at what plants show

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,120
you

79
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,219
right so it really does tie into what

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,739
we've been talking about but it also

81
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,900
ties into like a whole era

82
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,580
um like pre-215

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,158
you know

84
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,080
um and even like after 215 passed it

85
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,359
probably took what Rings like

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,319
five or eight years

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,959
for I remember like

88
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:36,259
2002 people feeling like they actually

89
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,539
could lean on

90
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:43,019
215 even though it passed in whatever

91
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,400
year nobody says yeah and nobody thought

92
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,759
they were going to be able to grow in

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,760
their yard not get [ __ ] with yeah so

94
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,798
they were still you know keeping it

95
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,780
mellow keeping it on the download but

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,519
then some friends of mine let her rip

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,680
they just went for it

98
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,500
and cops came people tried to rip it off

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,799
cops got called and the cops left the

100
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,780
plants and then we were oh it's a

101
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,739
[ __ ] green light

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,019
and yeah that's a major green light

103
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,358
so that was great though I mean for the

104
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,819
first time we were

105
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,319
putting them out in the sun and not

106
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:25,680
worried

107
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,918
and realizing the potential

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,720
that a plant could get real big so

109
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,060
chronologically speaking when you were

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,220
in Wisconsin what you were seeing out

111
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,600
there was what type of strains like

112
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,340
mostly were you seeing the afghanis

113
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,220
proliferate out there still pretty heavy

114
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:44,459
by the time you started yeah I didn't

115
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,160
really know I knew a few

116
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:50,159
few some of my older brothers buddies

117
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,580
were growing little gardens in their

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,040
apartments and whatever but I didn't

119
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,198
really know any outdoor Growers there

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,759
but you'd see the weed once in a while

121
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,419
come through

122
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,300
yeah uh but it was it seemed like it was

123
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:09,478
pretty standard kind of Afghani I mean

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,300
that climate back there you are limited

125
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,839
you know yeah that's true you could do

126
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,840
so

127
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,680
man

128
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:20,698
what were you seeing in Wisconsin strain

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,459
wise

130
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,860
you know people would say things like

131
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:28,500
Danny

132
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,280
I mean it was simple so basic not named

133
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,379
like this they were just stoked if you

134
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,359
got something that wasn't compressed

135
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,519
yeah right

136
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,840
yeah and there was there was two kinds

137
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,538
of weed basically there was green

138
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,478
Mexican and brown Mexican yeah and the

139
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,939
level of compression could vary widely

140
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,579
the best stuff was green and lightly

141
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:53,219
compressed the some of the worst stuff

142
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:56,579
was incredibly compressed and very Brown

143
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,120
yeah and strain names I mean you know

144
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:03,300
they just uh yeah I think I think uh

145
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,340
maybe maybe I'm speaking but

146
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,199
barely anyone knew what I was doing when

147
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:08,839
I lived in Chicago and was growing weed

148
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,180
absolutely

149
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,399
you were in a major populated area I was

150
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,720
in a rural area there was

151
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:21,239
it was all bad you could yeah they I

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,419
mean I remember just

153
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,720
people hearing about my friends and I

154
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:30,180
smoking weed and then like one of my

155
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,120
buddies got busted drinking and driving

156
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,259
and when he was in the cops they're like

157
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,600
we know you and that guy are selling

158
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,060
weed and oh you know I mean it was like

159
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,039
we were we were buying like a quarter

160
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,079
ounce once a month and smoking it in

161
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,779
one-hitters

162
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,800
we were so far away but I mean we were

163
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,959
like

164
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,020
years in our hometown because of that

165
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:58,500
okay and people are asking about various

166
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:00,240
Imports I can't speak for rings but we

167
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,860
both come from the Midwest he's a little

168
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,500
farther north than I was and he was

169
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,199
Rural and I was City but I literally saw

170
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,699
Mexican and when the Grateful Dead came

171
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,079
into town there would be some kind bud

172
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,180
yeah

173
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,399
um there was no Jamaican Imports there

174
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,918
was no Colombian there was no tie there

175
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,339
was no anything named there was brown

176
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:23,818
and green Mexican I remember I got Thai

177
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:27,359
stick once and it was literally tied

178
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,400
with a string on a stick but I was very

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,479
fortunate where

180
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,758
I met the I I like to say the right dirt

181
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:39,719
bag

182
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:42,060
hippie biker types that were older

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,880
and they weren't gonna smoke the worst

184
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,879
Brown weeds so they they had networks

185
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,719
set up somehow or whatever I was at

186
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,598
least getting like pretty

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,039
decent green weed pretty much from the

188
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,339
start

189
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,978
but that was I mean there was no weed

190
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,500
seen in my high school it was all just

191
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:07,620
drinking and there was a couple of

192
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,699
Stoners but there was no scene there at

193
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,780
that time

194
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:15,720
it just it just wasn't you know

195
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,939
go ahead you moved from northern

196
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,280
Wisconsin to our neck of the woods

197
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:25,019
Mendocino County you said was it was it

198
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:28,198
94 94 1994. right at Harvest time I had

199
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:30,659
no idea what I was even getting into I

200
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,459
just knew one person

201
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,399
came out here

202
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:38,038
within 20 minutes I was standing next to

203
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,038
a pot plant watching naked girls swim in

204
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,218
a pond it was it was like walking right

205
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:47,838
into a wet dream

206
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:51,500
I was already very into the hobby

207
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,820
I already had all the seed catalogs

208
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,899
memorized because I was buying High

209
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:03,420
Times and stuff and I had grown a little

210
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:06,059
um we've wired up a 175 metal halide my

211
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:08,399
friend rigged one together we had a few

212
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:12,419
plants and uh that I had saved some

213
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,039
seeds from uh some decent weed and we

214
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:16,740
grew them

215
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,919
some failed attempts at growing some

216
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,680
some Mexican seeds or whatever outside

217
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,620
that just went to [ __ ]

218
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:28,079
but yeah I mean it was very minimal

219
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,820
before I moved out here what was your

220
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,000
what was your impetus for coming out

221
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,000
here

222
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,778
I didn't actually thought I was going to

223
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,959
end up in like New Mexico I kind of had

224
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:43,139
dreams of desert living when I left

225
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,599
there and I knew one guy here

226
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,799
and he was one of my hookups for good

227
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,060
weed

228
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,240
and

229
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,119
um mushrooms acid whatever

230
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,580
he

231
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,440
he he left I saw him and he was like I'm

232
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,920
moving out to California if you're ever

233
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,040
there here's my aunt's number she'll

234
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,139
know where I am and I got a hair up my

235
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,299
ass I was like I I had been all over the

236
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,580
country traveling with my family growing

237
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,799
up but I had never been in California

238
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,040
state line so

239
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,799
I I just thought I'd swing through but

240
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:23,159
like I said within 20 minutes all kinds

241
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,740
of just on to me unimaginable things

242
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,740
were unfolding in front of my eyes I was

243
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,600
just like

244
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,180
weird hippies you know I grew up in a

245
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,420
pretty conservative

246
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:40,679
in a box type of place there wasn't a

247
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:43,979
lot of various lifestyle choices and

248
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,500
diversity or anything like that so it's

249
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,899
like where I'm raised I get it this [ __ ]

250
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,000
is entertaining right away I mean

251
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,879
stories of weird hippies in the

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,399
mountains and Pagan groups and old

253
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:59,639
communes I was just like [ __ ] this is

254
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,440
entertaining right here right

255
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:06,600
and for me naked girls were a big bonus

256
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,700
so Francis it would have been the other

257
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,820
but oh yeah I see why you guys are

258
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,320
drawing that

259
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,660
so yeah but I mean a lot of times people

260
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,278
people think people think when they hear

261
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,439
a Mendocino County because now it's

262
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,360
super famous for growing weed

263
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,360
it's not that it wasn't famous for

264
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,519
growing weed already it's just that most

265
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,800
people's like earliest memory of like

266
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,379
Mendo now is like two is the two is the

267
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,120
medical era yeah when you had like a leg

268
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,679
to stand on and you could kind of it was

269
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,139
sort of a cat and mouse between things

270
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,479
but when we both first moved out there

271
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,860
it was a totally different world in the

272
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,278
sense of

273
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,480
like uh everybody that did it kept it

274
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,759
pretty quiet

275
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,220
there was a there was a number of people

276
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,980
in town that had successful businesses

277
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,259
and stuff that did it but they kept real

278
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,240
quiet about it it was done in the Hills

279
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,399
it was done tucked away people didn't

280
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,600
want people to know their money came

281
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,360
from wheat yeah showing the [ __ ] yeah uh

282
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,240
not so and I were talking about

283
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,459
the successful guys are driving beat up

284
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,879
old trucks you would have never known

285
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:17,159
they weren't there was no flash that's

286
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,778
for sure yeah we were we were talking

287
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,399
just the other day about it and there

288
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:21,179
would be guys that like were worth a lot

289
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,059
of money

290
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:25,979
and their truck would be old and a

291
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,439
little rusted and have a few dents or

292
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,480
whatever and then like they popped the

293
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,240
hood and the whole thing is Chrome and

294
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,740
super Cherry souped up they've got a

295
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,139
souped up like they've got great

296
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,700
suspension they've got all this nice

297
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,860
[ __ ] but it's like they could drive

298
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,899
through our crap little town

299
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,879
and you look normal

300
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,500
yeah right because nobody wanted to

301
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:52,399
stand out nobody wanted to get targeted

302
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,399
and then even when 215 done he moves

303
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,300
um it took like he said it took a number

304
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,560
of years for people to get a sense of

305
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,919
what you could do

306
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,559
yeah you know most of the people I

307
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,259
learned from and were was exposed to

308
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,899
they were older already then and had

309
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,899
been doing it for a long time

310
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,000
so they they when they were they didn't

311
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,278
even they didn't even have

312
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,078
they didn't even have a fancy engine in

313
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,799
their truck you know they were just

314
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:24,838
chill they were just glad to to be

315
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,979
living up in the mountains and having a

316
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,920
home and

317
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,759
and be hanging out and being more

318
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:35,278
comfortable than a person working at one

319
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,379
of the local businesses or whatever they

320
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,019
were they were living good eat and go

321
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,240
Gotta realize too that Mendo was pretty

322
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,078
famous for being a huge logging

323
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,299
community

324
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,019
but that had sort of Fallen apart in the

325
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:52,859
80s and so I would classify it as pretty

326
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:55,919
poor when I first arrived very poor very

327
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,019
poor very run down so like even having

328
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,059
money was unusual like everybody that

329
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,220
had money was from some established

330
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,078
well-known family that owned businesses

331
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,839
in town yeah

332
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,879
you know yeah there was no there was

333
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,360
hardly even any weed around here

334
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,220
honestly I mean even though it was Mendo

335
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,639
and whatever

336
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,278
it would run out and if you were holding

337
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:23,700
something decent you were the man I mean

338
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:27,059
there really wasn't a lot

339
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,339
then no you know if you if you had two

340
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,799
or three patches in the woods and you

341
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,240
got away with one of them and you got 30

342
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,699
pounds

343
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,320
you were like loaded down with cash you

344
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,120
had a lot of loot you had whatever you

345
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,459
needed that year you were doing good you

346
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,220
were stoked a hundred and twenty

347
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,379
thousand bucks in 94 would have been you

348
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,199
know that's like that'd be like having

349
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,659
500 000 bucks now practically they'll

350
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,698
pay the prices were at that time for

351
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:56,278
land and homes and

352
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,919
stuff like that

353
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,259
yeah yeah those people

354
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,838
but yet they couldn't show it off so it

355
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,360
was kind of you didn't really know who

356
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,040
was holding I mean natso and I were

357
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,560
talking the other day and he met some

358
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,799
guy that had copious amounts

359
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:16,138
and he was living in a Shack in walking

360
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,419
around in his underwear all the time I

361
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,399
mean it's actually like I was telling

362
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:22,458
him it's probably like the wealthiest

363
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,799
person in wheat I've ever met

364
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:28,078
like I'm not even exaggerated I knew

365
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,939
exactly who he was talking about he was

366
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,159
the wealthiest person I think I've ever

367
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,920
met in weed and he had a bunch of huge

368
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,958
scenes that I don't want to describe but

369
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,599
he had this like this queen like black

370
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,479
and white poly Shack

371
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,420
that like stretched like in between the

372
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,759
trees with rope right and he had a

373
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:51,299
really nice like teak wooden table in

374
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,919
this thing and he slept in it and he

375
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,500
walked around like he had a huge like

376
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,078
multi-pack of tighty whities and it was

377
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,620
hot up there and he would walk around in

378
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:04,399
his tighty whities and his boots and he

379
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,259
lived in a visqueen shack up on the Rock

380
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,839
and he literally like I mean he and he

381
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,740
sold like unbelievable I mean he made so

382
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,720
much money

383
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,759
yeah you know but it was just that was

384
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,759
his life he ran various things he didn't

385
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,379
leave the hill he and it was just hot

386
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,578
and he didn't like it so he walked

387
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,019
around and

388
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,879
you know it almost think you'd almost

389
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,339
think that like he escaped from like a

390
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,259
mental institution I can't I can't blame

391
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,060
the man I walk around like that in my

392
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,419
house and I'm not I know me too I'm

393
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:35,338
still I'm carrying the torch too but

394
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,458
yeah I mean in a way it's like if you

395
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,560
busted that guy like farts but you know

396
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,719
he had nothing

397
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,059
you know I mean he might own 15

398
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,399
properties yeah and have like

399
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,719
underground grows and generators and

400
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,759
this and that and everything else but

401
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,199
it's like you know it's like if they

402
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,699
came and got tried to get him it's like

403
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:55,258
he didn't have sports cars he didn't

404
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:57,958
have a nice big house he didn't have

405
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,278
boats he didn't have anything that they

406
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,078
could find

407
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,519
like and that's that's kind of like what

408
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,019
I was thinking about when when you were

409
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,880
talking about that Rings was like the

410
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,798
real Old-Timers around here

411
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,179
they just like to live up here and they

412
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,619
liked having enough money so they

413
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,480
weren't poor

414
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,279
and they didn't occur yeah they'd go on

415
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,558
vacations

416
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,139
yeah you'd meet a lot of like hot girl

417
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,119
or kids and they traveled the world and

418
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,579
stuff but they weren't flashing anything

419
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,379
else like that was like their luxury

420
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:27,240
like their parents would help them

421
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,280
travel

422
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,500
so that was like that was more like

423
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,558
flashing wealth and Mendo kind of became

424
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,480
more of a 215 era thing definitely it

425
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,259
was because you had to like to stand on

426
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:45,298
with the with your you're legitimate

427
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:47,640
yeah it was the medical card to flash in

428
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:51,000
the 90s I think I would put it it was

429
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,759
Unthinkable I only know um a few people

430
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,640
that were probably dumb enough to flash

431
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,619
in the 90s and they ran a um

432
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,360
some kind of Hollywood Mansion they're

433
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,399
bringing actors in and out to show them

434
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,259
their little tiny [ __ ] girl I think

435
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,759
one of them went to jail and had Woody

436
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,839
Harrelson bail him out that's the only

437
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,460
people I could think of that were dumb

438
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:12,379
enough to flash like that like bring

439
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,380
people into a mansion with grows and

440
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,298
one guy before I even moved here I mean

441
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,759
they've had documentaries about that guy

442
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:24,298
and I can't remember his name

443
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,038
he was one of the biggest importers in

444
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,579
the country he was bringing everything

445
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:33,298
in through the bay and he built on

446
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:36,240
Robinson Creek Road he built this big

447
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:38,460
mansion with like watchtowers on it and

448
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,980
hidden rooms and stuff and that happened

449
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,380
before I got here it was rural like his

450
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,620
house was pretty hidden

451
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,840
but it was pretty extravagant and he

452
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,399
went down he went down big and he's out

453
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,099
now

454
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,380
he actually just bought that Mansion

455
00:18:53,099 --> 00:19:02,579
back from this guy I knew who owned it

456
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:04,679
but there was there was a um

457
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,859
maybe people should know that that like

458
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,380
so when I first moved out here I had my

459
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,000
my I literally had like just like rings

460
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,679
I had one friend that lived a little

461
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,259
north of Ukiah and that was like sort of

462
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,419
my landing spot where he got me situated

463
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:19,798
in the community

464
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,140
um and I thought it was going to be a

465
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,359
bunch of like Grateful Dead hippies you

466
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,919
know and back to the Landers and like it

467
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,599
was like I was from the city and it was

468
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,020
all these country people that lived

469
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,298
clean and beautiful and I got here and

470
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,918
there was some hippies but there was a

471
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:38,538
lot of weirdos there was a lot of

472
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:42,380
rednecks there was a lot of poverty

473
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:45,720
meeting a person that like like you

474
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:48,360
that just seemed mellow and like nice

475
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,160
and stuff was kind of rare it was a

476
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,099
rough crowd a lot of it I mean the

477
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,360
hippie side of it was pretty mellow

478
00:19:53,099 --> 00:20:00,719
but I mean most of it was pretty Outlaws

479
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:03,058
I mean as far as quantities went those

480
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,759
those were people way out in the boonies

481
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:08,279
and they had guns and they were

482
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:12,679
you know I mean Tales of shooting at

483
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,678
helicopters and yeah

484
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,620
people out in the boonies growing a lot

485
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,600
they're gonna always been a way where

486
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:24,058
we'd allowed a certain amount of people

487
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,339
that have like a lot of [ __ ] mental

488
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:29,759
illness yeah anger management and

489
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:33,240
various other ticks to like survive well

490
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,500
but not have to like like Smooth those

491
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,019
issues out

492
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,798
and so people were suspicious you know

493
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,599
there's aspects of uh of that you know

494
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,480
in the sense of it was just very

495
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:49,019
eye-opening like like once once logging

496
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,759
left this place was poor and so not only

497
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:52,918
we people think it was a weed Mecca

498
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,379
before the Mexicans took it over like

499
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,240
Northern California was also like where

500
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,820
lots of little batches of meth got

501
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,460
cooked so there was a whole underbelly

502
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,259
of meth people and there was a little

503
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,319
bit of a blending of the two communities

504
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,940
but not always but but you know there

505
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:10,859
was there there was various motorcycle

506
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,900
groups there was all kinds of weirdos

507
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:15,240
that owned land in the Hills I mean

508
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,580
because girls not populated growing a

509
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,640
lot of weed was always a lot of work and

510
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:22,619
I remember people way back then talking

511
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
about like hiring meth heads because

512
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:29,519
they would work you just keep keep them

513
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,558
High they'll dig 200 holes in the woods

514
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,440
yeah people steal all your [ __ ] when

515
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,960
you're not alone yeah and you know I

516
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,120
mean maybe not if you had uh I mean

517
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,880
people did things like

518
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,339
tied Mount lines in the middle of their

519
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,200
patch and chained them up to trees I

520
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,058
mean there was that checks out I mean

521
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,720
the stories

522
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:55,038
the Deep Well of bizarre

523
00:21:51,720 --> 00:22:01,380
stories in this part of the world is

524
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:04,379
it's troubling funny you know very a lot

525
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,299
of disturbing stories you know it's I

526
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,340
mean actually it hasn't been very

527
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:09,900
violent around here the last few years

528
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:13,259
the murders

529
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,360
the partners shooting each other

530
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,658
seems like it's really tamed down

531
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,759
finally it has yeah I mean you know

532
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,260
there was an aspect where there's

533
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,599
someone even older than us that I hope

534
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,400
to be able to bring on soon uh that can

535
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,139
speak of like the 80s but by the time

536
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,559
rings and I got here

537
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:36,240
you know Camp had been sort of hammering

538
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:38,759
the county for a good 12 15 years right

539
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,380
um you know there was a lot of back and

540
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,359
forth between that there was a lot of

541
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,940
sort of secret society like people

542
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,740
really kept to it to themselves it was

543
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,298
really hard to get accepted into certain

544
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,279
groups

545
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:53,220
um it was very it was a little paranoid

546
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,859
at a time and then on top of that

547
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,120
um you know let's face it right like so

548
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:59,219
you're getting four or five thousand

549
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,479
dollars a pound for your weed and you

550
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,159
have a whole bunch of money and it's

551
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,779
dark and it's cold and it's Mendo and

552
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,840
you're bored and it's winter

553
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:09,178
and so there was all kinds of scandalous

554
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,699
you know substance use

555
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,679
um which was fun and some of which had

556
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,558
negative connotations for whole little

557
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,340
groups of people you know yeah YouTubers

558
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,500
on on some of the old Growers I met when

559
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:27,359
I moved out here they were like

560
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,640
in the 70s or whatever late early 80s

561
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,500
they'd be like things started getting

562
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,419
[ __ ] up they'd be like that's when

563
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,058
people started trading their weed for

564
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:39,360
Coke and then it became trading it for

565
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:42,240
meth you know and it just started

566
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,339
getting funky you know one of the first

567
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,400
guys I worked with told me basically

568
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:49,439
that exact story that when you get 4 500

569
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,259
or 5 000 a pound for anything that you

570
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,419
grow that's decent right he said you get

571
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,940
bored in the winter and then the one guy

572
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,520
gets a kilo of cocaine or something

573
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,659
right and he goes and he goes then the

574
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,298
problem is is five years later

575
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,919
everyone's cheating on everyone else

576
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:06,599
yeah you know people are messed up

577
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,580
people are this people are that and when

578
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,500
you got in trouble back then you either

579
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,839
went to jail for two or three or four

580
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,000
years usually or you had to knock on

581
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,899
your friends there really wasn't a

582
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,500
defense

583
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:22,559
you know so there's an aspect there of

584
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,000
like you know I mean there's yeah there

585
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,500
was you know there was there was opiates

586
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,240
there was every problem you could

587
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,640
imagine existed on some scale there

588
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,558
wasn't that many people yeah right so it

589
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,000
wasn't like it but there was there was

590
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:34,379
Partiers of all kinds and there was

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,419
people that were definitely into a bunch

592
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,760
of bad things sure

593
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,460
um and uh you know weed was a way to

594
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,359
survive and so like maybe on a positive

595
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,980
note

596
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:49,139
uh before we get too dark on that level

597
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:51,480
it does set the stage because I mean I

598
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,600
I'll tell a very quick story I remember

599
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,940
like I was hiking with friends and we

600
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,219
were up on this Majestic trail and I was

601
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,320
still pretty like new from from the

602
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,679
Midwest so even just Hills excited me

603
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,839
you know like big expansive trees and

604
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,280
stuff and I'm like oh I'm tripping and

605
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,439
I'm like looking out over this thing and

606
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,779
it's all beautiful and I look down and

607
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,880
there's like dozens of cars

608
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,099
that people it was like a spot that

609
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,840
people drove up to and just to get rid

610
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,879
of their trash they would push their car

611
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:23,220
off the ledge yeah and it would just

612
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,860
roll down the hill and and like the

613
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,919
hills were littered with this [ __ ] yeah

614
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:32,519
I was amazed when I moved out here like

615
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,860
every time you found a beautiful turn

616
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,259
off to stop and look at the scenery

617
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,579
there'd be like just trash below you

618
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,200
every time

619
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,599
because a lot of the country people

620
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,640
would just take their trash and drive

621
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,500
and be going down the road at night and

622
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,140
just bags of trash they would just throw

623
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,419
out their vehicle off off the hill bears

624
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,500
and so people so I was shocked because I

625
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,000
thought it was going to come out coming

626
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,900
from the city I was like I'm gonna come

627
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,759
to this clean pristine Place weed

628
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:04,080
growing hippies redwoods the ocean food

629
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,599
organic food all that and that was all

630
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,460
there in bits and pieces yeah but there

631
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,139
was all this other stuff that I had

632
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,480
never seen and you know it makes sense

633
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,880
because you know that that stuff really

634
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,679
started stopping when the weed money

635
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,020
really started changing the game to the

636
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,659
point where there wasn't so much poverty

637
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:24,960
yeah most of the houses that we bought

638
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,539
or got into or the land was very cheap

639
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,700
um most of it was very run down people

640
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:30,960
would do little indoors or do outdoors

641
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,058
and they would end up fixing the

642
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,360
bathroom fixing the roof putting on a

643
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:38,759
deck just taking like a falling down 50s

644
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,979
Farmhouse yeah that they bought on a

645
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,619
handshake deal and every weed crop

646
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,900
improving it yeah so I'm gonna need

647
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:48,418
funky houses out in the country around

648
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,860
here yeah tons I mean now there are a

649
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,320
lot of them are all fixed up and nice

650
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:54,719
because it had 20 years of of money

651
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,339
coming in even if they're shitty still

652
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,058
they're worth a ton of money at this

653
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:02,099
point you know it's true you know so but

654
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,720
they maybe we could talk about for a

655
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:06,480
second just to get rather go from like

656
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,179
the Ambiance of the area to like what

657
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,679
were the what were the the strains that

658
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,340
you were seeing when you first came out

659
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,798
here and then obviously like you know

660
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:18,599
um just so people know there was there

661
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,879
wasn't a lot of there wasn't a lot of

662
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,158
names back then a lot of individual

663
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,679
families and friends had different seed

664
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,299
lines maybe you could get a cockamami

665
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,460
story out of a few of them about what

666
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:31,619
had happened in the past yeah but

667
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,500
everyone Grew From seeds so people got

668
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:36,298
seeds from their friends and then every

669
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,919
two or three years or something they'd

670
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:39,538
be like oh I need some more seeds I

671
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,880
better like take some of these males in

672
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:43,940
the bushes and pollinate some of my

673
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,220
females yeah

674
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,140
it seemed like a lot of like the ranches

675
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,019
around here there'd be like

676
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,659
a couple of people that were into making

677
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:56,759
seeds and everybody else just got seeds

678
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,679
from them that was pretty common too

679
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,200
there was some people that were just

680
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,480
into it into that side of it

681
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,600
you know and everybody else would just

682
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,819
go to them by starts from them or get

683
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,939
seeds from them that was pretty common

684
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:14,038
too there was there was still nerds back

685
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,080
then before we came out

686
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,658
yeah there was they were just harder to

687
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,158
find yeah you know and Matt and I have

688
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,720
had a lot of experience too with like

689
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,159
even people that we would consider to be

690
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,319
nerds today

691
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,580
you ask them about specifics of when

692
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,119
they were young

693
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:31,500
and they just don't have it yeah

694
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:33,959
they don't they just don't they just

695
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,480
don't remember it turned out good or it

696
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,058
didn't and even if it turned out bad it

697
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,720
was still worth the same um obnoxious

698
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:41,720
amount of money

699
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:49,500
is it led to a lot of diversity yeah

700
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:51,298
right so I just want people to know

701
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,819
before we start chatting about this that

702
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:56,158
like lineage was often hard to come by

703
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:58,798
there was some like poorly sourced

704
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,020
legends about a lot of it but everyone

705
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,179
that was growing weed had seeds

706
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:04,859
yeah and there was a lot of different

707
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,720
Hill seeds there was a lot of different

708
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:08,759
neighborhoods that had different seeds

709
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,079
because like Rings said there'd be one

710
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,298
or two guys that was like the

711
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,859
neighborhood nerd and they would do

712
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:15,778
breeding and then the friends would get

713
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:18,658
seeds from them and stuff and so there

714
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:20,398
was just a lot of diversity yeah yeah

715
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,500
you know a lot of people just didn't

716
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,439
even realize they could keep a male and

717
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,339
make seeds and it wasn't wasn't that

718
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,399
hard

719
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:32,099
you know they just they just thought it

720
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:34,739
was taboo to even have a male

721
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,359
anywhere around even though they could

722
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,519
have sold their seated [ __ ] for big

723
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,339
bucks even back then too as long as it

724
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,099
was green and trim decent

725
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,619
you know everything it's just that's

726
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:49,398
just the way it was then I mean you

727
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,398
can't say like

728
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:55,740
I mean that's why like with being into

729
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:59,038
the genetic side it was like when you

730
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,278
saw something good it wasn't all the it

731
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,398
wasn't even that often you know so if I

732
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:08,398
got something good I would be like

733
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,439
where'd you get this can I get this

734
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,959
I don't care where these are I'll drive

735
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,298
anywhere to get these seeds you know

736
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,278
just to try you might go you might drive

737
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:19,918
up to Oregon to get some seeds and come

738
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:23,519
back and pop them they're all Herms

739
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,640
you didn't you didn't know you know

740
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,038
so yeah and most people didn't keep we

741
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,179
lost most people didn't keep clones over

742
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,038
the winter

743
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,380
so it was like people would pop a

744
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,658
certain amount of seeds in Spring and go

745
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,399
through a process of sexing them and try

746
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,799
to figure out how many they thought they

747
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:43,019
could get away with yeah and then plant

748
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,179
females where they had to put them I

749
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:46,619
mean even I have a buddy who's uh who

750
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,899
was telling me like even some of the

751
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:53,038
first like hundred lighters he worked at

752
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:55,079
in southern humble right uh indoors they

753
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,119
were like literally like they made beds

754
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,619
on the floor and they planted seeds and

755
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,058
they went in and they cut the males off

756
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,699
at the base

757
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:05,278
yeah because it wasn't it wasn't a clone

758
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,620
world yet yeah so that's what they knew

759
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:13,558
yeah I mean you hear a few stories like

760
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:17,278
like that orange thing you had yeah

761
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:21,359
Nintendo yeah being like an old clone

762
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:23,759
that super rare yeah that was that was

763
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,199
that's kind of unusual tell us about

764
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,759
some of your first breeding projects

765
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,778
that's what I want to know about I want

766
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,579
to hear about some of these breeding

767
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:31,019
projects listen Reigns what's some of

768
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,418
the first he worked with when you're

769
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:36,119
actually like like I have a [ __ ] goal

770
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,960
I want to I want to end up with XYZ like

771
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,119
what's some of the first stuff you

772
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,120
worked with yeah it was just looking at

773
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:45,359
things like in the way they appeared you

774
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:49,579
know at that time I was young and

775
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:53,639
and uh you know dense and shiny was

776
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:56,759
pretty desirable you know and it's funny

777
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,460
to think back of how sometimes you'd see

778
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:02,278
something great and you'd be like oh

779
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,440
that stinks I would never grow that but

780
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,839
man does it smell good because you

781
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,798
didn't want you didn't want your [ __ ]

782
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,000
found

783
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:14,940
yeah uh so it was more about just like

784
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,240
finding something

785
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:21,298
that would come in before the weather

786
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,000
that was chunky and decent to work with

787
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:26,278
you know we didn't want Sour Diesel buds

788
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,700
at that time even yeah you know we

789
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:32,519
didn't want to do that kind of trimming

790
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,798
so it was really about just making

791
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,500
something that was decent to work with

792
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,119
not super needy to it like you're

793
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,339
sticking [ __ ] way up in the mountains

794
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:45,778
and visiting it here and there yeah

795
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:48,240
you're keeping a close lengthy eye on

796
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:50,700
everything so you you didn't want

797
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,640
something that like I remember the first

798
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,519
time I grew like a skunk one type of

799
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,440
thing we put it up in the hills every

800
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,700
time we went up there it was [ __ ]

801
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,759
yellow

802
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,100
it just wanted [ __ ] you know and some of

803
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,200
this stuff we we had going would be dark

804
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:09,658
green and happy with virtually nothing

805
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,940
it would do all right I mean the plants

806
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,440
weren't big they didn't need a lot

807
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,860
because we weren't growing these

808
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,240
monsters they were yeah Quarter Pounders

809
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:21,418
under the

810
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,940
in the bushes you know yeah so they

811
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,399
didn't need a lot we would just bring a

812
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,759
bag of baguino up in the hills and some

813
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,819
water holding crystals and and the hope

814
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:36,000
that things went all right you know

815
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:38,939
could be a dream dude Water Crystals

816
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,679
used to be huge yeah because you weren't

817
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,320
able to get to yours because most people

818
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,120
hiked into their site and it was far

819
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,759
enough away from your house or it was on

820
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,639
a safety net because if you only went

821
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,460
once a week in the your little water

822
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,460
line some an animal [ __ ] it up or

823
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,819
something and they went six days without

824
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:03,120
water and 105 degrees

825
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:05,639
wasn't cool I mean we I've said this

826
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,279
before but there's a there's a a big

827
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,039
like uh AG store I guess you'd call it a

828
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,619
garden store in Willits in Mendo called

829
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,358
spare time and they used to have you

830
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,858
used to walk into their front door and

831
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,699
they would have them you know they would

832
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:23,579
have a six foot tall stack of cases of

833
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:26,059
camo spray paint yeah because what he

834
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:29,039
was just saying is if you use soft poly

835
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:30,960
the rats the wood rats various other

836
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,539
Critters they'd smell the water and it's

837
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,838
so dry they'd come and they'd chew

838
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:39,179
through your poly to get [ __ ] hate

839
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:40,559
rats together you know to get water and

840
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,418
then all of a sudden your plants aren't

841
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,119
getting wet you know so people would use

842
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:46,079
some people would use PBC but then it

843
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,480
was white

844
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,179
so you needed to spray paint it to make

845
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,740
it look like the ground cover yeah right

846
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,960
before you put it together because

847
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,338
otherwise like you know and then they

848
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,559
couldn't they could smell it but they

849
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:00,119
couldn't chew through it yeah it was

850
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,239
amazing how

851
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:07,619
how Camp was back then too like they

852
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:10,979
would find like they took their time and

853
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:12,000
scanned the hill so closely they would

854
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,000
find

855
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,059
like a few little plants in the bushes

856
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,880
they'd take their time and just work

857
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:22,679
areas I remember diving in the bushes

858
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,079
when I first moved I I thought it was

859
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,779
cool as [ __ ] like oh the government is

860
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,320
trying to find people like us we're

861
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,820
diving in the bushes and I thought that

862
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,820
was cool as [ __ ] yeah

863
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,960
I mean there's an aspect too people

864
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,059
don't get that's why like everybody take

865
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,059
a shot every time not so says aspect

866
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:51,239
you people would hide them in the trees

867
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,039
like on little on on I never did that

868
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:55,799
but I had friends who would put them on

869
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,920
on you know raised Platforms in the

870
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,260
trees because the the uh helicopters

871
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,579
they'd be looking at a certain line and

872
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,260
they a lot of times their eyes would

873
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:07,440
miss it or they'd put them along the

874
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,420
line of a tree line or manzanitas you'd

875
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,820
hollow out branches and you'd still

876
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,159
leave the top cover and hopefully they

877
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,539
would make it but they were after it so

878
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,399
hard

879
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,320
um you know you really had to be careful

880
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,900
and then you would take different ways

881
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,760
to get to your spot often like it's not

882
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,099
like you drove your vehicle there or you

883
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,859
drove your ATV or whatever you didn't

884
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:30,900
even want to walk no the same pathway

885
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:33,119
because they'd see the path from the air

886
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,338
so you would take different routes to

887
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,619
get there and get in and get out you

888
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:40,920
know yeah you walk on the animal Trails

889
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,720
real carefully to not make them look

890
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,059
weird from there

891
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,059
yeah it was fun to try to camouflage

892
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:50,460
things and and it was fun to be a little

893
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:52,500
ninja I mean we weren't even doing much

894
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,940
it was just worth something and and

895
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,760
really

896
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,358
we were just into it you know we were

897
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,420
into the plants we wanted to have some

898
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:06,900
we were willing to hike up mountains to

899
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,480
get a very little bit you know it was

900
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,940
y'all are [ __ ] nuts dude I couldn't

901
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,800
take that kind of heart trauma like

902
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,320
going up and watching like you know

903
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,660
eight of your big [ __ ] rips like you

904
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,460
plant one for thieves plant one for pigs

905
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:23,219
and plant one for you like that's my

906
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,240
theory [ __ ] that I mean that was so

907
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:28,980
dramatic yeah even in spring when you're

908
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,979
like setting it all up

909
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,599
that's when you're digging your holes or

910
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,338
you're bringing in your if you're not if

911
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,680
you're not using the right the Earth

912
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:40,500
there that's when you had to hike in

913
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,358
your you know your your your soil you

914
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,099
had to bring in your amendments so you

915
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,078
could feed even if you were using native

916
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:48,539
Earth it was hard to feed on nothing run

917
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,820
your water lines maybe drill a spring

918
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,858
and then you're crawling in the bushes

919
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,200
carving out little spaces for your

920
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:57,539
patches that whole drill is spring like

921
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,338
people my age like from California we

922
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:02,699
don't even get what the [ __ ] that means

923
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:05,338
drill a [ __ ] spring yeah put in a

924
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:07,559
spring box so so the spring collects

925
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:11,279
water in the spring box and then run

926
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:13,920
piping from that box sometimes hundreds

927
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,960
of yards especially if you're downhill

928
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
you would try to find water witching

929
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,720
[ __ ] to find the strings how do you do

930
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,699
this I mean there was little springs on

931
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:28,379
properties you would you would like

932
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:30,000
build a box and then just rig up a pipe

933
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,820
going out the end it would collect a

934
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,639
little bit and just slowly trickle I

935
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,640
mean a lot sometimes we had them feeding

936
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:40,319
little tanks or something but because

937
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,118
you needed Springs because you it's not

938
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,099
like you could put in a well

939
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,500
because even if you had solar or

940
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:48,960
something like that they'd see it yeah

941
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,699
so I don't even like I just don't get

942
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,320
how people found Springs out in the

943
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:54,598
[ __ ] mountains like how did you find

944
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,440
these things under the ground for red

945
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:01,680
spots I met people that knew Springs

946
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,200
were you know or or found properties

947
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:07,259
where there was like little hidden parts

948
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,199
of the property that had a little water

949
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,359
source yeah yeah and basically a spring

950
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:15,299
box is just digging a hole big enough to

951
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:17,219
put a certain size like man-made box in

952
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,200
there that's going to collect the water

953
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:21,118
and let it build up to a usable amount

954
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,239
and then you can drain it out one end

955
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,059
and then the gravity feed yeah gravity

956
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,479
feed it yeah for the most part yeah stop

957
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:29,480
started

958
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:43,500
low low grade to somewhere it was tricky

959
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:47,279
to get the bubbles out of those lines I

960
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,920
remember working on that very hard

961
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,500
lots of hiking back and forth to see if

962
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,838
it worked now or not that's a great

963
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,358
question was there ever turf wars over

964
00:39:54,838 --> 00:40:00,838
Springs

965
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:02,338
[ __ ] man hell yes there was I and I was

966
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:03,420
thinking about that I was thinking about

967
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:08,400
that when

968
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:11,400
when 215 happened I mean a lot of I you

969
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,039
don't hear this talked about very much

970
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,920
so all these water sources in the

971
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:19,679
mountains people kind of had them that

972
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,519
was kind of their Turf you know they had

973
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:27,659
those spots and when 215 happened

974
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:31,519
the cartels came with guns and pretty

975
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:35,219
much kicked everybody off their spot and

976
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:37,199
what it but 215 was allowing all the

977
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:39,239
people that had those spots to do it

978
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,699
right in their [ __ ] yard then so it

979
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:45,358
was like a little transfer

980
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:47,039
of territories or whatever Out of the

981
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,199
Woods yeah

982
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,259
but I mean people used to there used to

983
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,598
be a thing where you know I mean people

984
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,579
would have arguments over how far away

985
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,680
the patch should be from your home so

986
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,359
that if they did Camp it they would just

987
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:02,338
take the patch and not mess with you

988
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,259
yeah and there would be arguments about

989
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:05,639
how much you should hike and how far

990
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,380
away

991
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,900
um and so it's not like it was just like

992
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,880
off in the bushes you know 100 yards

993
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,220
from your house a lot of these things

994
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,680
you'd hike into or hike up to and it

995
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:18,959
would be a good distance away and that's

996
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:22,980
why the little how like the little

997
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,679
Trails were so like we really had to

998
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,240
think about that stuff he did the if

999
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,578
they saw a trail they'd just walked

1000
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:32,519
right to it and there would be you know

1001
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,920
you had to really ninja that stuff

1002
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,420
and be careful you know so yeah it's

1003
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,000
like I remember like a lot of times

1004
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,579
especially when I was hiking up like uh

1005
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,739
dry amendments or something like that in

1006
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:45,960
the spring I would just want to puke

1007
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:48,239
because you're like going uphill and

1008
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,699
you've got like a 50 pounds of food on

1009
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,139
your back and you're hiking and then you

1010
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:53,338
know you get to mid-summer and it

1011
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:54,719
doesn't even feel like anything because

1012
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,179
you're in shape and you've done it for

1013
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,279
months super in the beginning and that

1014
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:02,338
was as a young buck I'd be like oh my

1015
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,540
God this is [ __ ] rough so another

1016
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:06,358
thing that's kind of funny that people

1017
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:10,019
should know is that for me it's like you

1018
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:12,779
use something like uh like fish meal or

1019
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:14,280
bone meal or blood meal or something and

1020
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,820
then all of a sudden you realize like oh

1021
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,460
that attracts Bears yeah

1022
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:23,160
you know yeah and bears are some kind of

1023
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,300
big animal comes in looking for what

1024
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,759
smells

1025
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,280
because you've got composting fish meal

1026
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,020
or composting crab meal or whatever and

1027
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,420
then a big ass bear starts to dig in

1028
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:35,099
your soil and ruins your patch yeah

1029
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,680
because you use the wrong kind of

1030
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:39,960
fertilizer yeah I think the people I

1031
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,659
learned from right away was it was like

1032
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,980
back guano right away because they were

1033
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,139
hippies

1034
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,000
but then a lot of people who didn't care

1035
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:51,779
about that kind of stuff they use those

1036
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,400
little osma coat pellets oh yeah balls

1037
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,800
and they would just put those in there

1038
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,039
and that would be done all they had to

1039
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,839
do was just Add Water

1040
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,000
time release I mean there were some

1041
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,858
people that once you I mean and I'll say

1042
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,719
this too there was people that had

1043
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:09,420
established spots that they were able to

1044
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,159
do small patches in year after year and

1045
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,858
so some of those people had some really

1046
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:16,500
nice soils some really nice holes they

1047
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:19,739
amended them well every year so it was

1048
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,599
like an active organic situation and so

1049
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:24,299
there was some better pot that came out

1050
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,220
of those well in the long it up sucked

1051
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,220
the water was really good

1052
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,219
back then too people aren't using city

1053
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,159
water

1054
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:41,219
treated water it was just like Mountain

1055
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,739
Water you know and just like any other

1056
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,838
living thing

1057
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:48,179
the quality of water is it makes a

1058
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,119
difference you know they've had minerals

1059
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:53,338
in it it had little bits of stuff in it

1060
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,260
that's where I learned too that the old

1061
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:58,440
timers always taught me that pot was

1062
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,940
like a lateral root growth plant and so

1063
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,940
they would always say like in the bushes

1064
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,000
it's better to dig like an 18 inch or a

1065
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,818
two foot deep hole that was wide

1066
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,139
rather than one that was deep you know

1067
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:12,420
they're like the plant's going to want

1068
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:15,000
to go wide and you'll get more weight so

1069
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,338
like make a shallow a depression and

1070
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,358
fill it in rather than digging like a I

1071
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:20,759
mean there was people that would dig

1072
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,519
like four five six foot deep holes but

1073
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,900
that would have been me

1074
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:26,639
dude you're such a it's such a [ __ ]

1075
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,800
you're like crawling in the manzanitas

1076
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,659
with like a shovel that can strap to

1077
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,640
your back and then you're underneath

1078
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:34,739
there and you're just like chomping at

1079
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,118
the ground I mean six feet with the tiny

1080
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,939
little and then you gotta like that and

1081
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,858
then glad I was young at that stage I

1082
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,900
mean because nothing [ __ ] mattered

1083
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:44,699
you know yeah you just got it done or

1084
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,619
whatever but it wasn't easy and then you

1085
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:48,419
had to remove this the you know like

1086
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,940
because a lot of it a lot in Mendo is

1087
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,940
red clay it's not like we have like a

1088
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:56,579
ton of black loamy deep rich Earth that

1089
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,519
you can just like plant into it's like

1090
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:01,079
mountainous and Rocky and clay-like and

1091
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,759
so you definitely had to add some stuff

1092
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,960
to it and amend it if you wanted to get

1093
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,560
anywhere it's not like you could just

1094
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,740
like dig a hole and plant yeah

1095
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,078
yeah let's get into strains guys people

1096
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:15,019
want to hear about the strains oh God

1097
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,640
okay so

1098
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:20,219
it's always so funny because without

1099
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:22,980
clones to reference people it's like

1100
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:25,980
you're just telling them about a ghost

1101
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,440
you know like a little bit a little bit

1102
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,900
you know but I had a moment today where

1103
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,240
I was harvesting some volunteer

1104
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,500
accidental thing that popped up in my

1105
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,500
yard

1106
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:40,500
and uh the rain got it it was the only

1107
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:43,500
early thing I had and it it had some big

1108
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,380
soft colas on it and the rain kind of

1109
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,838
started getting to them a little

1110
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:52,079
botritus yeah

1111
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:54,179
and I'm smelling the piece I picked a

1112
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,359
few days ago and I'm smelling it I'm

1113
00:45:54,179 --> 00:46:00,059
like this smells just like afghan's 30

1114
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:02,400
years ago what was it do you remember

1115
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:03,599
what the volunteer was from yeah it was

1116
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,800
uh

1117
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:11,400
some Cookie Kush crap across my blue

1118
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,680
Dynamite Super Lemon OG crap that guy

1119
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,079
had one male last year so it had to be

1120
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:19,139
from that male I can dig some blue

1121
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,359
Dynamite crap over cookie cush [ __ ] you

1122
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,400
know people hate cookies and I don't

1123
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:26,400
like what it stands for either but

1124
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,579
ultimately if it's gassy and it has a

1125
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,639
good I mean if it's gassy it it's still

1126
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,980
decent smoke I mean sure I can't stay

1127
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,500
high off it I can't I can't stay high

1128
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,659
off it has no legs for me so I'm a bit

1129
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,000
strong and some of it's not and

1130
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:44,460
sometimes I when I first found cookies

1131
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,719
like Forum an animal and tried those

1132
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:50,818
things I actually appreciated

1133
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:53,759
not being still [ __ ] I don't need to

1134
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:56,099
get Sledgehammer [ __ ] freaked out

1135
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:00,300
stoned all the time sometimes I want to

1136
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:02,400
yeah you know but I mean I was high I

1137
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,280
just wasn't just because I'm not

1138
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,740
tripping the [ __ ] out I'm not high you

1139
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:12,720
know not everything has to have me

1140
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:15,779
[ __ ] just these foreign for me like I

1141
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,578
get I Get High like it's a good height

1142
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:21,720
for 10 minutes and then it's just like

1143
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:23,960
yeah so that's fine if you gotta go pick

1144
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,779
your kid up from school in the afternoon

1145
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,760
that is a good point

1146
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,440
there are times and I talk about this

1147
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,720
with rings quite a bit actually where

1148
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,059
like I'll smoke something like that my

1149
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:38,159
headband like the LA and I'll go into

1150
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:39,900
town stupidly like I've done this

1151
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,118
hundreds of times to myself over the

1152
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,740
years I'll get all baked on the wrong

1153
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,180
thing and I'll go into town and I'll be

1154
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:46,799
standing in line at this weird little

1155
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:50,219
store and it'll be like the Twilight

1156
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:54,780
Zone in line and I'm like why right am I

1157
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:56,879
here three star great oh no but one

1158
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,579
thing I will say about cookies

1159
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,720
is that I don't like cookies that much

1160
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,660
either

1161
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,919
um but but two things about it one is

1162
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:08,279
that since we were just talking about

1163
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:11,460
the gorilla era I would have flipped out

1164
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,040
to have something cookies what came out

1165
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,480
in the wrong era if we would have had

1166
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,000
that [ __ ] in the gorilla era because

1167
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:21,059
cookies requires low light

1168
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,179
it's super dense right it doesn't have

1169
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:25,799
to get that big to weigh a lot of food

1170
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:28,980
it doesn't need a lot it doesn't like

1171
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,220
food it doesn't like sunlight so I could

1172
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:35,338
have put it in a deep shade not fed it

1173
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:37,279
very much and just loaded Manzanita

1174
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:40,500
patches with cookies

1175
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,060
come in early enough to not mold oh it

1176
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,219
would have been great it would have been

1177
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:46,139
great yeah a lot of a lot of the things

1178
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:49,858
people are growing when I moved out here

1179
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:52,078
did not come in early not everybody grew

1180
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:54,960
specifically for early that was kind of

1181
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:59,280
my own like mission was to create

1182
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:02,280
something like early that was strong and

1183
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,900
looked good and decent to work with and

1184
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,720
and stuff like that

1185
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,400
but a lot when I moved out here I was

1186
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,358
hanging out on a mountain and people

1187
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,720
were

1188
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:16,440
were uh bringing in [ __ ] baseball

1189
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:18,000
colas from the for out of the rain in at

1190
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,338
the end of October

1191
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,338
you know and the people I learned from

1192
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:25,858
were really good and that was

1193
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,858
they knew how to let things get there

1194
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:31,559
they weren't gonna freak out and pull

1195
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:34,679
[ __ ] yeah you know they really they they

1196
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:37,500
taught me a lot of stuff like I I just

1197
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:40,019
got lucky and met people that really

1198
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,739
were into it and

1199
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:45,900
and cared about it and were also down to

1200
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:47,939
take their time to show me some stuff

1201
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,119
and tell me why

1202
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:54,240
they did this or why they didn't do that

1203
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,700
there was a lot of of just Hill weed

1204
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:00,059
that had a good amount of sativa in it

1205
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:02,098
of all kinds back then yeah and it took

1206
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:04,679
a while like there's a lot of weed that

1207
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:07,079
didn't finish until say like late

1208
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:09,480
October to early November

1209
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:13,560
um but it resisted the rain pretty well

1210
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:15,960
and Mendo most Falls there's a lot of

1211
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,880
warm dry fall in Mendo

1212
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,579
you know it might rain for two or three

1213
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,640
days and then be sunny for weeks

1214
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:26,160
it just depends you know so there was a

1215
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:27,299
lot of Sativa weed and because all the

1216
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,460
weeds sold

1217
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,260
there wasn't like I think what started

1218
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:34,019
with the purple craze and then you know

1219
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,700
the various things is is everyone

1220
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:36,800
started getting the same cuttings and

1221
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,899
blending them

1222
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,900
this era is the total opposite of that

1223
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,358
like all kinds of random unique weeds

1224
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,800
some of it pretty Mitzy but all kinds of

1225
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,400
different stuff just floated around

1226
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:54,420
because all weeds sold yeah and every

1227
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,400
every smell you can imagine today was

1228
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:00,358
already there back then

1229
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,420
you know just who you if you took the

1230
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:05,519
time to see as much as possible which I

1231
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:08,159
was into if people were like

1232
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,659
I was just into it you know I was just

1233
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:12,420
like oh somebody's got some different

1234
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:14,399
[ __ ] I'll go and look through it and ask

1235
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,139
him questions if I like some but I

1236
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,720
remember smelling

1237
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:23,338
super intense cherry

1238
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:27,539
back back then Super intense lime all

1239
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:30,480
the earthy skunky Afghani smells

1240
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:34,380
and just just kind of a little bit of

1241
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,659
everything and all different Leafs

1242
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,059
all different kinds of [ __ ] you know

1243
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:41,279
talk about some of the the most unique

1244
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:42,960
[ __ ] that you remember seeing um during

1245
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,760
your early days there what some of the

1246
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,300
most not necessarily by name but

1247
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,579
describe it if you can yeah

1248
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,880
I mean I keep on thinking about this

1249
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:56,460
this some stuff that uh

1250
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,640
my friends grew it actually down in the

1251
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,500
Watsonville and uh girlfriend down there

1252
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:03,539
that was going to college so I was down

1253
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,059
there a lot when they were doing it but

1254
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:07,920
one of the guys was ex-military he had

1255
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,619
friends up in Humboldt

1256
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:14,159
and they had some little gorilla thing

1257
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:16,318
in a canyon in Watsonville

1258
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,659
and when it was done he brought us all

1259
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,759
this stuff and it was just like sativa

1260
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:24,779
you know and there was

1261
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:27,359
there was there maybe it was kind of

1262
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,400
purple but it wasn't it was like great

1263
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:31,558
and these guys knew how to cure things

1264
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,920
beautifully they were really into it

1265
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:40,260
they took their time they cared

1266
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:42,659
and we call that gray bud and one of the

1267
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,819
one of those two sativa strains was

1268
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:47,899
called Golden Lion so somebody up in

1269
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:50,400
Humboldt would recognize that name

1270
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:53,220
yeah Golden Lion and

1271
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,000
and uh you know I just figured it was

1272
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:59,578
from some Rasta crew up in Humboldt

1273
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,318
and uh but

1274
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:07,200
I remember that gray Bud

1275
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,639
my friends and I smoking it and like not

1276
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,858
even talking

1277
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:16,139
like we just left our [ __ ] bodies and

1278
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:19,739
it was [ __ ] amazing but

1279
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:22,440
the most memorable things to tie Afghans

1280
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:26,459
from spyrock one of the first things I

1281
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:30,358
saw that just had everything Beauty

1282
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:32,099
smell really wild highs and stuff I

1283
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:34,619
remember my buddy would take his

1284
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:37,640
scissors hash and it looked like what we

1285
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:39,960
called monkey's blood opium it was like

1286
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:42,598
translucent red

1287
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,880
and I remember smoking that and being

1288
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:48,180
sitting on the ground and just holding

1289
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,338
the ground waiting to come just to get

1290
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:54,739
my bearings it was so potent but the

1291
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:54,739
those Thai Afghans blew me away

1292
00:53:55,139 --> 00:54:00,539
um you know all these characters were so

1293
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,059
funny low bird the guy who called

1294
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:06,318
himself lobert a weird

1295
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:09,420
jungle monkey from Hawaii growing

1296
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:14,579
Hawaiian sativas in their in the like

1297
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:16,500
94. he had great stories of swazi's and

1298
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:20,460
he said all him in the old heads they

1299
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:23,400
liked swazi's that was like the the gold

1300
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,679
in Hawaii in like the early 90s or

1301
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,139
something interesting yeah I never got

1302
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,219
to see that he grew some Hawaiian sativa

1303
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:33,239
seeds here

1304
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:35,639
and would bring the plants in every

1305
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:38,578
night because they weren't going to get

1306
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:40,679
done until I think he harvested them at

1307
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:43,740
Christmas they were [ __ ] great they

1308
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:46,679
take they had really floral sweet smells

1309
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,598
really nice some of them had really nice

1310
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,519
little shade of purple in them some of

1311
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,579
them stayed green no matter how cold it

1312
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:54,900
was yeah you know

1313
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:58,200
and some of that too is like because

1314
00:54:54,900 --> 00:55:00,480
weed was was that so valuable then it

1315
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,279
was a lot easier to dry and handle

1316
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,039
things if you wanted to in a really nice

1317
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,319
way because there wasn't so much of it

1318
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,259
like it wasn't some overwhelming amount

1319
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:11,400
of [ __ ] you could treat it nicer you

1320
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,440
know

1321
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,539
um and uh and that made a difference too

1322
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,400
one of the things maybe we should note

1323
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:18,900
is that

1324
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,480
um when you get pounds or you'd see

1325
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,579
pounds most of them were all mixed

1326
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,460
phenos

1327
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:28,619
yeah because they weren't from clone so

1328
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,780
you would get there would be pounds and

1329
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:33,420
they would be all the same line

1330
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,339
you know but they would trim it up and

1331
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,659
they would blend it up and you'd be

1332
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:38,159
looking at this and this would smell

1333
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:40,379
like that and this would smell like that

1334
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,480
and then you'd be like oh wait what is

1335
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,519
that one and then you start digging in

1336
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,260
the bag looking for weed that looks like

1337
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:48,000
that and picking out and try to gather

1338
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,880
yourself a little pile and you're like

1339
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,179
that one right there we always joked we

1340
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:58,740
always joked how people would uh there'd

1341
00:55:54,179 --> 00:56:00,299
be like an over ripe purple bud in a

1342
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:03,239
mixed bag

1343
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,680
that had no resin on it just smelled

1344
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:07,019
like garbage because it was way over

1345
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:09,179
ripe and somebody would see a pound

1346
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:11,818
they'd focus in on that one they'd be

1347
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:15,719
like look at that purple

1348
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:17,699
[ __ ] yeah maybe I think we just laughed

1349
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:19,259
because it was garbage you know that

1350
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:21,239
would probably be me not at all for me

1351
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,559
would be doing that but yeah but I mean

1352
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:24,419
there's an aspect too and then some

1353
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,519
people would be like oh some of these

1354
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,980
pounds are kind of Mitzy but these

1355
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:31,800
plants are really flavorful so we're

1356
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,440
gonna take a few ounces and put them

1357
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,300
into into the top of each of these

1358
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,760
pounds so that when people open the bag

1359
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,440
there's like a nice selection and it

1360
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,960
makes them think that the whole bag is

1361
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,720
like that but really it's like these are

1362
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,920
nice and the rest of them are just okay

1363
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:49,139
and but it all went because people

1364
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,619
wanted good weed there was it wasn't

1365
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:55,019
hard they didn't have any options to get

1366
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:57,000
better weed there was you know there was

1367
00:56:55,019 --> 00:57:01,318
no like you weren't getting rejected

1368
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:05,219
yeah if you just dried yourself stuff

1369
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:07,199
nice got keptic green got it dry enough

1370
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:09,000
to where it wouldn't turn yellow right

1371
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:12,659
away

1372
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,599
your [ __ ] was was golden you know I mean

1373
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:18,179
it was really appreciated by people

1374
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,579
whatever it was sometimes I remember

1375
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:22,858
that one time I grew that skunk one it

1376
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:24,900
was funny because people are like this

1377
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:30,380
[ __ ] is weak

1378
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:30,380
and they were just bummed on it yeah

1379
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,300
I can imagine I I've heard similar

1380
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,379
experiences recently with another office

1381
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,480
they didn't have money and they were

1382
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,818
spending 50 bucks on an eighth even here

1383
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,039
in Mendo you know if they took a smoke

1384
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:45,960
to you know they would Brash and [ __ ]

1385
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:47,880
out if they were taking a couple hits of

1386
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,338
something and not getting tore back they

1387
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,960
were kind of bummed well and also one

1388
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:54,960
thing that that I don't know if a lot of

1389
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:58,440
people realize seeds prices probably

1390
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,260
have instead of inflation risen have

1391
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,000
maybe dropped now compared to who they

1392
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,160
were they've always been pretty

1393
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,019
especially Scentsy they've always been

1394
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:08,699
pretty expensive for the time they've

1395
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:10,800
dropped massively because if you think

1396
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:13,558
about the purchasing power

1397
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:16,800
of what that the seed cost hasn't

1398
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,940
changed all that that much you know but

1399
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,880
I mean obviously there's some people

1400
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:23,220
that have some hype that try to like

1401
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:27,240
encounter inflation or whatever but

1402
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:30,000
um you know for me imagine buying seeds

1403
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:32,159
from Europe back then you know like some

1404
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,559
of my older brother's friends went to

1405
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:37,019
Europe and brought back seeds in the 80s

1406
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,119
and stuff and they had their little they

1407
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:41,338
lived in Metro areas you know

1408
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,019
Minneapolis things like that and they

1409
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:47,460
would have their little closet grows

1410
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:51,000
above 400 or a couple 400s or whatever

1411
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:53,400
and so they had that Dutch stuff but

1412
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,380
you know when I moved out here I was

1413
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:58,200
just like man it didn't seem like that

1414
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:01,140
Dutch stuff even mattered out here but

1415
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:03,118
it did everywhere else you know I mean

1416
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:05,759
most of the Dutch stuff was imported

1417
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,680
from either California Washington or the

1418
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,380
Pacific Northwest so they didn't really

1419
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,519
have a need to go to the Dutch to get a

1420
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,680
[ __ ] up version of what was already

1421
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,858
there yeah you'd never I never heard

1422
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:19,379
people say like oh we went to we put

1423
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:21,900
Northern Lights in this or we put skunk

1424
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,460
on in this it was like it was mostly

1425
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,798
older stuff

1426
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:28,619
and it really didn't have much which I

1427
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:30,298
appreciated I already was a total nerd a

1428
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:33,180
High Times nerd

1429
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:36,000
I knew all those strains I lusted at

1430
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:38,818
wanting to try them and stuff but here I

1431
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,460
was able to try some Northern Lights and

1432
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:43,558
skunk Northern Lights mixes at my

1433
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:47,519
brother's friends had made and my other

1434
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:48,960
one of their friends grew G13 clones in

1435
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,900
their early 90s

1436
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,298
and I I got to smoke that out but most

1437
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,980
that was yeah they were actually the

1438
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:57,719
first crew I knew that didn't clones

1439
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,719
they kept stuff if they had a great

1440
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,699
plant they they kept it they were into

1441
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:04,618
their gardening there was actually this

1442
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:07,618
crew from before I even moved out to

1443
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:09,240
Mendo uh from Wisconsin

1444
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:10,920
um that had this they called it

1445
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:16,078
blueberry skunk

1446
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:18,358
and I used to get it in 93 94 95 96. I

1447
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,740
never was able to get a clone of it out

1448
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:22,440
in California

1449
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:25,078
but they had little you know in Madison

1450
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,460
and some of these rural areas outside of

1451
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,500
Madison they'd have these little four

1452
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,119
and six lighters and they would all grow

1453
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,239
this blueberry skunk that's what they

1454
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,980
called it yeah and it was really

1455
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:36,239
attractive I have no idea what it was

1456
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,679
related to

1457
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,358
um and I never grew it myself but I got

1458
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,419
buds of it

1459
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:45,119
um and uh you know but that what's

1460
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:47,220
interesting about that too is that when

1461
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,619
when you when you found somebody that

1462
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:52,618
was intelligent in the sense that like

1463
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:54,720
they cared about the intelligent as the

1464
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:56,338
wrong word I'm sorry when they were when

1465
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,259
they cared about lineage

1466
01:00:56,338 --> 01:00:59,940
yeah when they were [ __ ] autistic

1467
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,799
nerds like us right when they cared

1468
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,079
about lineage not intelligence but just

1469
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:05,639
like a weed nerdism to like they'd tell

1470
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,220
you something like that like oh it's a

1471
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:10,259
Mexican with a swazi or it's a Colombian

1472
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:13,439
mixed with some afghan that we and they

1473
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:15,359
get you know but most of it was the name

1474
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,619
of the closest Little Mountain or town

1475
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,019
that it came from

1476
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:20,460
when I first moved here there was so

1477
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:22,818
much weed that was like oh this is from

1478
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,500
whitethorne

1479
01:01:22,818 --> 01:01:27,358
this is from the hills above Covelo this

1480
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:31,079
is some Sherwood Road this is some Long

1481
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:33,779
Valley this is some you know some Alder

1482
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,818
Point weed and it was just named kind of

1483
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:39,119
by the little town or the little area or

1484
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:41,460
the little Hills that it came from yeah

1485
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,760
yeah more than anything nobody wanted

1486
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:48,000
their names associated with anything

1487
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:50,280
you know and so when I brought out the

1488
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,739
Maui because I you know I brought out

1489
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,859
the Maui and the Crystal chunk to

1490
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:58,199
California because from Chicago that was

1491
01:01:55,858 --> 01:02:00,239
all we knew was like the only reason why

1492
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:02,699
you started seeds was to find a killer

1493
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,558
clone and then you use the Clone yeah

1494
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:06,298
you know we were all indoor and stuff

1495
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,480
like that so

1496
01:02:06,298 --> 01:02:11,759
um you know and so I came here and

1497
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,619
clones like you said clones were rare

1498
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,160
people were shocked that I was like

1499
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:19,680
running rooms of the same thing yeah

1500
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:21,659
workers Keepers were just planes that

1501
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,179
were kept because nobody kept [ __ ] you

1502
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:26,098
could have kept anything and and if you

1503
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:29,039
had those I mean there just wasn't many

1504
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:33,119
clones I I you know I always think of

1505
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,119
your Maui athgoo

1506
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:39,119
um what else yeah we had the afghoo up

1507
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:42,358
here Matt oh yeah big time it was early

1508
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:44,640
and good it looked like indoor because

1509
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:46,920
it was so resonance and stuff so it's

1510
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:49,440
very popular because it came in at a

1511
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,960
decent time Outdoors too it had it has

1512
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,338
amazing Terps too unless you get sick of

1513
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,619
it because pretty much everything with

1514
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:56,940
Africa smells like after and you can't

1515
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:59,280
get sick of it if that's all you're

1516
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,039
smelling like that cantaloupe weird

1517
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,619
mangoey

1518
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:07,558
there was a Northern Lights

1519
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:11,519
blueberry I think that went around here

1520
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:14,160
that smelled it either was the same or

1521
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:17,579
it smelled very similar

1522
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:19,078
early on back then and that was that was

1523
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:20,579
sort of like when you when you did a

1524
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:22,680
bunch of outdoor seeds and stuff like

1525
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:25,440
that that was my first experience with

1526
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:26,399
like oh wow there really are dominant

1527
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,200
traits

1528
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,000
you know and I remember some of my first

1529
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:31,739
readings thinking that I could breed

1530
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,719
away from certain things I wasn't fond

1531
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:36,118
of and breed towards other things I

1532
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:37,858
liked more and then sometimes that

1533
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:39,720
worked really well and I Pat myself on

1534
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:43,500
the back and sometimes that trait was

1535
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:46,078
just ingrained and I was like oh I can't

1536
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,940
get rid of it you know it's just part of

1537
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,400
it you know like you were saying things

1538
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,260
like half goo smell like AFCO or

1539
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,400
terpenolene or something like that you

1540
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,740
know like there's things where you're

1541
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,858
like oh I can't get it out of there yeah

1542
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:01,318
yeah I remember getting really sick of

1543
01:03:58,858 --> 01:04:03,480
after pounds because I was born I just

1544
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:05,338
thought all clones were like great to

1545
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,920
see and maybe they were great to smoke

1546
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:11,099
here and there but as far as the mission

1547
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,960
I was on it was all clones were boring

1548
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:15,119
unless you just made seeds with them and

1549
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,240
then the seeds you grew out of them were

1550
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:21,780
fun you know like I just wasn't a clone

1551
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:24,659
guy ever pretty much like I loved sour

1552
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:27,059
so much that I kept that for a long time

1553
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:30,000
and a lot of times having

1554
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:32,280
other friends hold it at times or this

1555
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,039
or that I kept it around because it was

1556
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,798
just like a daily driver to me like just

1557
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:39,058
a something I like smoking and we could

1558
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:40,739
talk about the top three favorite

1559
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,059
strains but I'm not sure I can get any

1560
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:44,578
strain names out if we could actually

1561
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:46,920
talk to them about that yeah I mean I

1562
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:48,599
know all the Clones you know I always

1563
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,940
hung out with people that grew the

1564
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:52,680
clones and enjoyed them and stuff I mean

1565
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:55,440
as far as like things that are

1566
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:58,139
identifiable there certainly is some

1567
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,099
something not even identifiable I just

1568
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:01,618
mean like

1569
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:04,260
top three favorite smokes not even

1570
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:05,880
necessarily strains but smokes events

1571
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,500
would smell like taste and like I mean

1572
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,298
that's really like their stray names

1573
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,858
there's identifiable stuff and we use

1574
01:05:09,298 --> 01:05:12,960
that so other people know exactly what

1575
01:05:10,858 --> 01:05:14,219
you're talking about but yeah you can

1576
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,139
transcend that just by talking about

1577
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:18,598
what it smelled like tastes like the

1578
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:20,940
highs maybe top three interjects just

1579
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:23,400
really quick though is that before we

1580
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:26,159
get away from it which is uh

1581
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:30,180
there was two sour diesels I saw early

1582
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:31,858
on one is the one that I still have

1583
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:34,019
um which I've talked about before but

1584
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:36,298
then there was this other one that that

1585
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:39,599
Rings was much more familiar with that

1586
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:43,259
existed that was took longer was more

1587
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:45,119
feathery uh herbed more was more

1588
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,040
delicate so you could talk about that

1589
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,980
for a minute because the sour that I

1590
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:52,619
ended up keeping was one of two that I

1591
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,480
saw and the one that he had was much

1592
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,338
different but we but it was it was

1593
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,900
spread around back then but it was

1594
01:05:56,338 --> 01:06:01,019
significantly different in growth

1595
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,519
pattern and it had a similar nose it was

1596
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:05,039
definitely similar but it was very

1597
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:09,179
different in growth yeah we considered

1598
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,259
it to be like Piney

1599
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:13,858
um

1600
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:16,079
I mean it it was that I mean the whole

1601
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:18,598
sour thing was just crazy how it just

1602
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:23,039
took off I mean the first time I got it

1603
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:26,700
actually was from a guy um Mean Gene uh

1604
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:28,380
nose too he grew up near him

1605
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,239
um

1606
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,880
the guy gave it to me and I was like

1607
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,979
this [ __ ] is ugly because still at that

1608
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,619
time everybody basically wanted

1609
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:39,298
something dense round with a lot of

1610
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:43,019
resin on it

1611
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:45,358
and my buddy handed me the sour and I

1612
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:48,358
was just like [ __ ] this shit's all

1613
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:52,500
feathery as peach colored hairs on it

1614
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:54,838
and just looked weird to me but

1615
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,460
as soon as we smoked it it was just like

1616
01:06:54,838 --> 01:07:00,900
I remember looking at it and just being

1617
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:03,000
wow this is going past what the norm is

1618
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:06,660
like this it was the first like

1619
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,239
commercial thing that didn't look like

1620
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:12,000
everything people wanted for a long time

1621
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:14,338
dance round Chris Lee blah blah blah you

1622
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,318
know it was just such good smoke it

1623
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:18,298
would make people forget about those

1624
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,639
other things they thought they desired

1625
01:07:18,298 --> 01:07:24,000
so I thought it played a really good

1626
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:27,900
role in that like kind of breaking down

1627
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:31,739
some walls that were just always there

1628
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:35,338
like it it didn't always look great in a

1629
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:37,618
bag you know sticky little

1630
01:07:35,338 --> 01:07:40,318
fluffy

1631
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:42,660
I mean it really you had to hit it right

1632
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:44,460
to get a lot of resin on it but even if

1633
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:47,460
it didn't have a lot of resin on it had

1634
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:50,400
big flavor and it had that Zippy high

1635
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:52,920
that was real clear

1636
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,619
you know Brokers would buy it on the

1637
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:58,559
nose oh yeah well it seemed like but

1638
01:07:55,619 --> 01:08:00,660
then trimmers would cry because they

1639
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,579
wanted that big the stuff that he was

1640
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:05,159
just talking about all that big chunky

1641
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:07,559
resonance that stuff's easy to trim and

1642
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:08,879
people can get through it sour gets

1643
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:11,640
popular and a bunch of people are

1644
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,280
growing that cut and it's feathery and

1645
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:16,559
shitty and loose and sticky and you have

1646
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:19,798
to be all gentle with it to not [ __ ] it

1647
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:23,880
up anyways it would give trimmers why

1648
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:25,798
they were [ __ ] doing it what yes you

1649
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:29,000
would have to go a little sour

1650
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:31,920
introduced Psychotherapy to trim bossing

1651
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,420
because you had to like convince your

1652
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,719
trimmers like this is going to be worth

1653
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,338
it please do this I know it sucks

1654
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:41,460
because it was a struggle it was like

1655
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:43,380
sometimes it looked ugly outdoor I mean

1656
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:46,020
it still had all the turps and the Good

1657
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:49,440
Buds and stuff like that but it

1658
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:51,060
it did not form up into a piece you know

1659
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:53,460
but then I saw some people growing in

1660
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,140
greenhouses and feeding it intense food

1661
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,119
you know we are kind of more on the

1662
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,859
hippie organic side so we weren't

1663
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:00,659
dropping big

1664
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:03,420
you know we weren't throwing grow more

1665
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:06,358
on it or anything like that you know

1666
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:08,460
so but I remember people pulling a lot

1667
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,500
of different looking stuff out of that

1668
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,899
same clone just by the way they were

1669
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,119
feeding it for sure they could get some

1670
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:18,379
pretty big dense bugs out of it if they

1671
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:18,380
nuked it with food

1672
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:26,039
you know but I mean top three strings

1673
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,319
I'd almost say sour sour sour I mean

1674
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:31,920
there wasn't and I'm not I'm not really

1675
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,539
that attached I'm into keeping on moving

1676
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,319
and seeing

1677
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:39,899
what comes out of these seeds that I've

1678
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:40,798
collected or bought or whatever over the

1679
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:42,778
years

1680
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:45,000
I don't I don't really get that attached

1681
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:48,179
they all get me high there's certain

1682
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:52,079
highs I like better yeah

1683
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:54,779
but I'm willing to have a bad Buzz just

1684
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:56,579
to try something new you know there's

1685
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:59,399
something I don't like I just like to

1686
01:09:56,579 --> 01:10:01,800
keep moving because I want to see plants

1687
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:04,079
that's it's kind of I was a hobbyist

1688
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:07,260
when I got into it it was just like

1689
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:09,000
more plants all from seed preferably

1690
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,340
just so I could it was like information

1691
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,119
to me to go to those kind of Gardens and

1692
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:16,800
just see Expressions see different

1693
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:18,479
Tendencies you know you could after a

1694
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,539
while you're just like oh that's heavy

1695
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:24,658
Afghani at this guy's Garden you know or

1696
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:26,100
I think that's that's something like me

1697
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:28,799
and Caleb and a bunch of other people

1698
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:30,900
that that are are big into

1699
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,239
identification through Visual and

1700
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:35,339
bringing through traits and and all that

1701
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:38,459
the one advantage that we had was seeing

1702
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:40,800
a lot of different strains and like I

1703
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:43,380
told you the other day my mentor

1704
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,400
um uh Hogg he would always tell me like

1705
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:49,800
you you want to learn you learn by by

1706
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:52,920
growing the bass lines baselines bass

1707
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,719
Lines no lights stump one Haze you want

1708
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,219
to grow as many different types of

1709
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,198
afghanis as you can you want to grow as

1710
01:10:56,219 --> 01:11:00,119
many ties as you can in Mexicans and

1711
01:10:58,198 --> 01:11:01,859
Colombians you don't if you don't grow

1712
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:04,439
those you don't know [ __ ] about pot and

1713
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:06,779
that's what he told me yeah that's cool

1714
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:09,539
that's good yeah it's a good place to

1715
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:10,859
start and you see you know one one of

1716
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:12,600
the things that always interests me when

1717
01:11:10,859 --> 01:11:15,059
I when rings and I are in one of our

1718
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,100
many combos is that there's certain

1719
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:19,679
lines that he's been playing with for a

1720
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,840
very long time and then you really get

1721
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,179
to see because you've crossed it to a

1722
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,860
lot of different things what are the

1723
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,840
traits that are dominant that keep

1724
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:29,939
popping up what does it get give to

1725
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,440
crosses you know there's things that

1726
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:33,299
he'll be like to me he'll be like you

1727
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:36,299
know a lot of people don't like this

1728
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:38,400
line but here's four things that I just

1729
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,739
love that it just throws in its progeny

1730
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,319
all the time and so I kind of lean

1731
01:11:40,738 --> 01:11:45,658
towards it you know because of these

1732
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:48,238
things you know and there's stuff he's

1733
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:50,460
done like you know we did um it's gotten

1734
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,678
Pat we you know we did a little a little

1735
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,539
collab if you personal collab where he

1736
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:58,020
had some you could talk about this he

1737
01:11:54,539 --> 01:12:00,119
had some old Maple Leaf uh Indica from

1738
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,679
Scentsy seeds and that era where they

1739
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,800
were still selling it

1740
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,380
um that we blended with a bunch of stuff

1741
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,420
um blue Dynamite uh you know there's

1742
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,460
been you know sours and cushes and

1743
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,899
various different lines

1744
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,300
um and I base you know he makes C

1745
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:16,738
basically every year yeah so some of

1746
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,300
this stuff someone was asking in the

1747
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:19,879
comments when did you first get blue

1748
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:24,239
Dynamite

1749
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:27,179
2002. I said early 2000s but yeah that's

1750
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:30,119
when I got sick of just kind of

1751
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:33,239
freeing my stuff to itself over and over

1752
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:37,260
and kind of just being like okay this

1753
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:39,059
stuff has this kind of range and and I

1754
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,520
want to see other people's [ __ ] I want

1755
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,199
to see what these people in Canada are

1756
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,719
[ __ ] with or

1757
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:48,779
or whatever and I had read about Maple

1758
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:50,760
so I ordered some maple seeds and it's

1759
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:53,219
funny because I bought in so many things

1760
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,380
over the years to check them out all

1761
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:57,840
these things that I hear old schoolers

1762
01:12:55,380 --> 01:13:00,300
talking about the only things I really

1763
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,640
have that are still fresh and poppable

1764
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,860
in my collection to this day have blue

1765
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,739
dynamite in them or Maple Leaf in them

1766
01:13:04,859 --> 01:13:10,319
everything else is just come and gone

1767
01:13:07,738 --> 01:13:13,379
and it's not that I think those things

1768
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:15,179
are are the greatest or this or I mean

1769
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:19,140
none of it's the greatest to me it's

1770
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:21,000
just all more more more more I just want

1771
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:23,340
to see more plants but they were

1772
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,899
reliable they were reliable to do what

1773
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:27,360
they did yeah

1774
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:29,579
you know the maple was great it wasn't

1775
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,259
very good looking generally it had a

1776
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:34,079
nice smell and it had a great smoke

1777
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:35,880
ability that's why I liked it you said a

1778
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,158
lot of terpinoline Expressions but there

1779
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,219
were some cushy in there or more dense

1780
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:43,439
Afghani type yeah I remember when when

1781
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:47,158
natso and I did that little collab I

1782
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:51,178
remember Caleb hit him up and said do

1783
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:55,019
you see any actual Maple Leaves yeah

1784
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:56,760
yeah had one I had one I sent it I sent

1785
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:59,940
it to them you know yeah that's cool

1786
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:01,140
yeah yeah and I mean we we kind of we

1787
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:03,539
kind of did like a little open

1788
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:05,219
pollination with that not that it was

1789
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:08,399
very big I think we got

1790
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:10,679
four boys and three girls to pop out of

1791
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,599
some of the old seed but we let them

1792
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:15,960
pollinate each other like crazy and then

1793
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,579
we threw in a bunch of like uh clones

1794
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:21,179
that I like

1795
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:25,079
um yeah if I you know chems chem 91 chem

1796
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:29,819
D Mendo p uh the tanjo the super silver

1797
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:33,899
haze the headband uh you know just a a

1798
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:37,619
collection of stuff because you know G

1799
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:39,839
from seed in there I threw a few things

1800
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:40,559
from seed in there too and I've grown I

1801
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,199
mean

1802
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,380
not so as in part many of those but I've

1803
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:48,059
popped I've seen hundreds and hundreds

1804
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,340
of plants out of there

1805
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:54,300
um

1806
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:58,260
the Loompa headband Maples and I had a

1807
01:14:54,300 --> 01:15:01,380
Karma G I had like going a buddy of mine

1808
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:04,520
wanted to would you say that Karma

1809
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,520
Karma never heard of her go ahead

1810
01:15:06,679 --> 01:15:11,219
what was interesting it was really cool

1811
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,079
I had a buddy a few years ago call and

1812
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:16,500
he was off the grid and he was like I

1813
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:18,600
want to just dap a whole bunch of seed

1814
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,579
stuff can I get some seeds so I gave

1815
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,780
them tons

1816
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:28,079
and I gave them the Lumpa headband with

1817
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:30,658
the Maple and the caramel G I had made

1818
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:32,880
with the Maple and it was it's like the

1819
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:34,679
classic OG story where they're all kind

1820
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,739
of the same even though they got all

1821
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:40,020
these names those two rows those two

1822
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:41,759
rows they might as well Bend from the

1823
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:44,100
batch same batch of seed there was

1824
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,440
basically like two main expressions and

1825
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:48,420
they looked like each other you know so

1826
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:50,219
that's why I like running seeds you get

1827
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:53,340
to just see that kind of [ __ ] you know

1828
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:54,840
yeah I crossed um I the other day I was

1829
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,699
trying to add it I was some like nine

1830
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,619
different OG's to the Blue Bonnets just

1831
01:15:56,698 --> 01:16:01,500
to see how each different one combined

1832
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:02,640
its theme exact mail that that was

1833
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,920
pretty true breeding throwing the same

1834
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,020
expressions and there there was very

1835
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:10,440
little variance I mean like mostly like

1836
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:12,600
the sfv and the Louie and all that you

1837
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:15,419
can't it's hard to tell them apart yeah

1838
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:18,120
yeah they're so similar and I mean sure

1839
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:21,119
there was a little different smells and

1840
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:23,698
stuff you know in the different cuts but

1841
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:27,599
the genetic there whatever was in them

1842
01:16:23,698 --> 01:16:30,000
wasn't that far apart exactly yeah

1843
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,699
and you know I mean I don't know it it's

1844
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,100
interesting in that regard because uh

1845
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:37,379
you know just so people know too it's

1846
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:39,060
not like I don't think that those maple

1847
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:42,179
seeds that we used were like from the

1848
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:44,219
original pack they had probably been no

1849
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:46,260
they were used a couple of times they

1850
01:16:44,219 --> 01:16:49,020
were they they were just spread to

1851
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:51,659
themselves several times to just keep

1852
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:54,719
them going I mean

1853
01:16:51,658 --> 01:16:57,799
that was 15 years after I bought them

1854
01:16:54,719 --> 01:17:00,739
what was the medwoman

1855
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:03,239
medwoman who brought oh yeah a bad dude

1856
01:17:00,738 --> 01:17:07,079
I couldn't believe he posted a picture

1857
01:17:03,238 --> 01:17:10,079
of this mad woman medwoman was a

1858
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:10,800
Northern Lights something if you look it

1859
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:13,869
up

1860
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,060
it won a contest up in Oregon

1861
01:17:13,869 --> 01:17:18,359
[Music]

1862
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:21,659
or Washington years ago and it won for

1863
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:23,880
being like a good medical strain I had a

1864
01:17:21,658 --> 01:17:26,158
buddy up in Eugene

1865
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,940
that sourced some really good great

1866
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:32,219
clones that was in 0.607 I was living up

1867
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:36,539
in Mount Shasta area

1868
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:38,640
and my buddy from Eugene came down he

1869
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:41,460
brought from Roseburg to Oregon he

1870
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:45,000
brought medwoman he brought shishka

1871
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:47,579
Berry he brought a grapefruit cut that

1872
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,679
is unlike any grapefruit I've ever seen

1873
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:51,600
again it was [ __ ] amazing it's one of

1874
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,219
the it's one of the few ones I wish I

1875
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,120
had because usually I just don't care

1876
01:17:53,219 --> 01:18:00,119
I'm just one popular but that grapefruit

1877
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,979
was [ __ ] insane

1878
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:04,079
um cheese

1879
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:06,839
he got he brought down some really great

1880
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:09,658
stuff I threw

1881
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,699
I threw my this this whole this thing

1882
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:13,979
and my friend and I made the Bilo I

1883
01:18:11,698 --> 01:18:17,339
threw that on everything because that's

1884
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:20,399
what we had I had moved back down here

1885
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:21,779
and we brought these beat up moms down

1886
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:25,679
here

1887
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:28,738
and nobody really had the capacity to

1888
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,600
like take cuts and keep stuff or or we

1889
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:32,339
weren't interested at that time it was

1890
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,620
kind of a transitional time in my life

1891
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,940
and so we just threw what pollen we had

1892
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:38,279
on it

1893
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:40,799
I still have a whole shitload of those

1894
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:42,779
somewhere in the freezer the seats yeah

1895
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,940
of the grapefruit

1896
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:48,059
the grapefruit's The One That Got Away

1897
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:50,399
the the last batch of those seeds I gave

1898
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:53,580
to a buddy to grow out the year we had

1899
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:55,799
our fire they burnt there's no more

1900
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:58,859
grapefruit hybrids no

1901
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:02,840
no and I and we've tried to find that

1902
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:06,238
that cutting and organ several times

1903
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:08,880
very hard with such a generic name yeah

1904
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:11,879
I tried to grow out Relic

1905
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,880
grapefruit

1906
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,800
um to see it because he was in the

1907
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:18,198
similar area and he had a lot he had a

1908
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,480
lot of the same things he worked with

1909
01:19:18,198 --> 01:19:23,219
berry cheese

1910
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:26,698
grapefruitment man he probably had the

1911
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:30,000
same ones I did I grew those out there

1912
01:19:26,698 --> 01:19:32,460
was no crazy grapefruit there was old

1913
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,380
school smells in it it was cool but it

1914
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:38,158
was a different kind of grapefruit

1915
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:40,079
probably yeah yeah definitely yeah I

1916
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:41,279
mean people call different c99 it's

1917
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,579
great for we have a sweet pink

1918
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,300
grapefruit we have grapefruit Romulan I

1919
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:47,420
mean there's so many different

1920
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:49,260
grapefruits yeah

1921
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:51,539
grapefruit I mean the good thing about

1922
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:54,060
it is is that it's like I was talking

1923
01:19:51,539 --> 01:19:55,920
about it uh it's kind of funny when

1924
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:58,860
people find some kind of terp or

1925
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,960
combination and then start to claim that

1926
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:01,920
like anything that does that comes from

1927
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,020
them

1928
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,940
right like you like if there's

1929
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,699
grapefruit there's gonna be grapefruit

1930
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:11,219
again just because we lost the terp

1931
01:20:08,698 --> 01:20:13,379
combination of certain ones it's common

1932
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:15,658
enough that it popped up in enough

1933
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:18,179
different things that I'm confident

1934
01:20:15,658 --> 01:20:19,679
it'll exist again in some format well

1935
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:22,500
you know it's kind of like the blueberry

1936
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:24,899
story right like I mean one person

1937
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:27,539
claims all smells of blueberry and

1938
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:29,819
cannabis is all his descendants you know

1939
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:32,340
Etc but we know that like I've seen

1940
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:34,679
blueberry pop out of Irene Sour Diesel

1941
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,360
you know like super blueberry chirps

1942
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:37,739
it's possible to find in all kinds of

1943
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:40,198
different combinations and we'll always

1944
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:42,539
run into it again yeah you never no I

1945
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:46,139
mean especially if your seeds have a

1946
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:47,880
good deep pool in them you know you

1947
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,100
could get all kinds of [ __ ] I mean when

1948
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:54,539
I grew out the maple

1949
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:57,060
uh Mendo perps I probably popped I don't

1950
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:58,979
know two three hundred of them or at

1951
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:02,159
least 200 of them or you know to be

1952
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:04,919
conservative yeah range is [ __ ]

1953
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:07,379
amazing you get such and that's fun to

1954
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,420
me at this point instead of trying to

1955
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:11,400
make something consistent

1956
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:13,739
I almost would rather make something

1957
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:16,799
wild at this time that you can actually

1958
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:19,619
get something unique out of you know

1959
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,900
yeah I mean Caleb makes a really good

1960
01:21:19,619 --> 01:21:23,519
point dude where he talks about like he

1961
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:26,158
used the Mendo perps as an example

1962
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,800
because it has a really wide genetic he

1963
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:30,539
was like if I gave a hundred s1s to like

1964
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,340
seven or eight different friends and ask

1965
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:34,679
them to select what they like and breed

1966
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:37,380
with it it would probably end up with

1967
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:39,179
wildly different selections yeah and

1968
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:42,300
people would take it in their own way

1969
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:43,920
and it wouldn't be similar at all yeah

1970
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,440
and I think the maples kind of like that

1971
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,158
the maple the maple from Scentsy is

1972
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:48,899
probably

1973
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:50,819
it's probably like two or three

1974
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:52,679
different of Neville's Maple cuts and a

1975
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:54,899
little skunk one and it's probably

1976
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:57,000
pretty wide you know yeah and then the

1977
01:21:54,899 --> 01:21:59,879
mendo's wide so you cross that and you

1978
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,800
just get like a whole host of it isn't

1979
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,300
really is what it is it can be a lot of

1980
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,000
different things the maple was

1981
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:08,940
dominantly I like I told Matt the other

1982
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,880
night it it had long inner nodes it had

1983
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:13,799
fluffy kind of terpenolene based stuff

1984
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,359
somewhere resinous some looked pretty

1985
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,760
ropey Dopey

1986
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:20,639
but everybody liked it as far as just

1987
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,100
smoking a joint you know it was good

1988
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:24,960
but every once in a while I'd say the

1989
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,640
rare thing in that line was to get

1990
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,880
something that actually had a little

1991
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:33,840
density to it and a resinous appearance

1992
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,640
to it in more of a like a fat leaf that

1993
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,800
wasn't the common thing but it was in

1994
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:40,920
there yeah you know I had that same

1995
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,360
experience with black domino the exact

1996
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,340
same experience it was one that I

1997
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:47,579
expected to find some faster finishing

1998
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,860
almost blackish purple like uh really

1999
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:52,198
resinous cushy looking things and what I

2000
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:55,500
got was exactly what you described which

2001
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:58,799
were like 13 14 week Airy fluffy

2002
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,939
terpineline not a lot of stuff that one

2003
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,739
actually didn't have a lot of variants

2004
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:04,319
that from what I saw it was just all

2005
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:06,059
tended to be that one yeah but I'm sure

2006
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:09,359
there was other stuff in it just in the

2007
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:11,880
pack that I popped that yeah like 30 or

2008
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,738
better exactly I bought 10 you know it's

2009
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:17,880
like what are you gonna find I remember

2010
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:20,579
people ordering Scentsy Afghani Ones

2011
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:23,579
based on the picture oh yeah

2012
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:27,359
fun stuff they are all just super tall

2013
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:29,939
super leggy they weren't they were they

2014
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:33,420
did not get fat leaves

2015
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:36,719
buff structured [ __ ] out of that you

2016
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:38,520
know yeah there's a lot of really poofy

2017
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:40,800
ugly Afghani number one I've only seen

2018
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,800
like a few really Prime Cuts ever

2019
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:47,640
selected from that line I will say that

2020
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:49,739
you know uh a lot of the Afghan that

2021
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,900
first came over to Mendo and Humboldt

2022
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:53,579
and stuff a lot of the Old Timers I

2023
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:57,119
think that's a consistent thing with

2024
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:59,880
Afghani in the sense that like there's a

2025
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:02,960
lot of kind of boofy Afghan I mean

2026
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:05,219
everything ran that G13 nl2 from Neville

2027
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:08,060
some of the last original seeds he had

2028
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:11,340
and it is exactly his as well

2029
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:12,960
as he's describing it it was terpineline

2030
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,020
loose

2031
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,520
yeah he wasn't stoked yeah no but

2032
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:19,500
there's I mean there's an aspect where

2033
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,380
then you you find afino that you want

2034
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,520
and breed with that and there are you

2035
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,380
know it's like that's kind of like

2036
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,120
everybody wants land race but nobody

2037
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:28,619
wants diversity because that means it's

2038
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:30,779
like they don't want to like pop a few

2039
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:33,359
packs and it all sucks yeah I get

2040
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:36,300
excited about ugly plants at this point

2041
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:38,639
like to me that's fun and some of those

2042
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:41,699
really ugly things smoked really nice

2043
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:44,219
and some of this really dense crazy

2044
01:24:41,698 --> 01:24:46,619
stuff to me that's not like the most I

2045
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:48,840
mean I need to get you some of that Rose

2046
01:24:46,619 --> 01:24:50,819
flow I grew I know I gave the rest to

2047
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,840
cry baby of it pure but it is some of

2048
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:53,519
the

2049
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,420
ugliest [ __ ] [ __ ] I've ever seen in

2050
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:59,760
my life it burns up with any nutrients

2051
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:01,440
but it's bright red pretty leaves like

2052
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,539
there's so much pretty about it and it

2053
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:07,139
and for flows there's like no density to

2054
01:25:03,539 --> 01:25:09,840
it but it breeds great yeah but

2055
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,179
ugly as [ __ ] not much resin yeah it's

2056
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,279
it's one of those that you it's very

2057
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:17,899
unique uh-huh

2058
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:20,399
yeah yeah I know I mean

2059
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:23,639
you know we didn't need to really be

2060
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:26,819
visually that appealing until Instagram

2061
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:29,460
I view the Instagram era as like a

2062
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:31,259
massive change in what weed had to look

2063
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,698
like there was lots of weed that was

2064
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:35,340
somewhat ugly

2065
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:37,500
but if it worked and smoked and tasted

2066
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:39,779
really nice and got you Zippy high like

2067
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:42,899
you were stoked like he was talking

2068
01:25:39,779 --> 01:25:45,599
about that sour you know that's sour it

2069
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:48,119
was it was it was stemi it was loose it

2070
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,820
was funky looking in some ways but it

2071
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:53,579
got you ripped high yeah it tasted great

2072
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:56,698
tasted amazing yeah

2073
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:59,158
you know so yeah I think of it a little

2074
01:25:56,698 --> 01:26:01,979
different I think the market and people

2075
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:04,379
just always especially when spending 50

2076
01:26:01,979 --> 01:26:06,718
bucks was a lot to them because they

2077
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,560
didn't have much money they wanted it to

2078
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,560
be

2079
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:12,179
like they wanted the appearances that we

2080
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,120
used to call it fake

2081
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:19,460
fake tits and bleach Bond hair weed you

2082
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:23,819
know they wanted dense crystally buds

2083
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:26,219
just to look at because blackberry kush

2084
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:29,460
I have blackberry kush I mean honestly

2085
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:31,679
dude you know I remember I never [ __ ]

2086
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:34,619
with that clone I saw tons of it but I

2087
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:37,199
remember getting an ounce of weed in San

2088
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:39,359
Francisco in the 90s once and it was we

2089
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:41,279
you know we just called it Hydro you

2090
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,738
know it was some kind of indoor and

2091
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:47,099
there was only like nine butts

2092
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:49,859
and we were like so pumped you know

2093
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:52,380
because each Bud was like two to four

2094
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:54,238
grams yeah you know what I mean it was

2095
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:56,520
like looking at like these chunky you

2096
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:59,519
were like oh God somebody gave me like

2097
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:01,500
the breeder stash yeah you know because

2098
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,120
you know it was one of those things

2099
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,520
where it was like it wasn't that common

2100
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:07,619
to see so you wanted visually appealing

2101
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,540
I don't remember anything about that

2102
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:12,359
weed except for how impressed we were

2103
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:14,100
that it was nice butts yeah it looked

2104
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:16,198
nice and big yeah it was just blue it

2105
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:18,780
was just bright green and bright orange

2106
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:19,919
hairs and Frosty and all these big

2107
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:22,679
chunks

2108
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:25,980
a lot of times people and they got an

2109
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:28,260
eight that just had one Chunk in it they

2110
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:30,359
were kind of butt hurt you know like

2111
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,719
they they or they questioned if you were

2112
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:35,179
giving them 2.8 instead of 3.5 of course

2113
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:39,300
yeah oh

2114
01:27:35,179 --> 01:27:41,340
but it but if it was good if it if it

2115
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,779
was strong they've just didn't forget

2116
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:45,719
you know

2117
01:27:42,779 --> 01:27:48,840
they they'd want more

2118
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:50,939
and you know let's see someone asked

2119
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:54,360
what were the earliest purple strains

2120
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:58,138
ring saw in Cali

2121
01:27:54,359 --> 01:28:00,539
I'd say the earliest well the the real

2122
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:02,940
the earliest ones were just overripe

2123
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:06,359
depleted plants that maybe turned purple

2124
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:08,399
and they weren't we we thought oh

2125
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:10,859
somebody said they had purple he'd be

2126
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:12,960
like oh it's garbage you know because it

2127
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:16,259
was always like something left on the

2128
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:17,960
vine depleted whatever it wasn't really

2129
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:21,719
good but

2130
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:27,119
Laytonville Laytonville had uh in fact

2131
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:30,719
that ties back to the underwear guy

2132
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,559
um in the shack

2133
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:34,859
um

2134
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:37,020
they there was a a real common type in

2135
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:39,359
Laytonville and this I kind of sometimes

2136
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:40,920
I think of this with the Mendo perp

2137
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:42,799
story it's kind of my own take or

2138
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:47,340
whatever but

2139
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:49,079
there there was a green and a purple and

2140
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:51,179
they were both really pretty you could

2141
01:28:49,079 --> 01:28:54,300
tell the purple was supposed to be there

2142
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:57,000
instead of something that was you know a

2143
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,739
reflection of some something not good

2144
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,639
you know was that the strain that people

2145
01:28:58,738 --> 01:29:05,218
called the purple from Laytonville

2146
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:07,500
maybe okay maybe that's the second time

2147
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:09,179
I've heard uh the Laytonville purple

2148
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:11,219
like a specific Laytonville purple

2149
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:14,219
mentioned in relation to like one of the

2150
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:17,760
early purple yeah I've seen a bunch of

2151
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:21,060
families that I'd met back then had the

2152
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:23,760
similar stuff and it'd be like they'd

2153
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:26,820
have either this bright green it was

2154
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,920
never real dense it was just nice yeah

2155
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:31,019
and then there was like a purple side

2156
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:35,460
that was really pretty

2157
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:38,460
that would be in there too yeah and so

2158
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:40,198
and it all it often had a real sweet

2159
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:43,920
like Fruity

2160
01:29:40,198 --> 01:29:45,599
type of smell to it also interesting and

2161
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,639
there's an aspect too that people should

2162
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,159
know that what what Rings is talking

2163
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:52,859
about when like overdone [ __ ] is

2164
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:55,079
freaking uh uh uh

2165
01:29:52,859 --> 01:29:58,259
um people would do first and second and

2166
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:59,939
third cuts and so a lot of times there

2167
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,100
would be purple weed that would be like

2168
01:29:59,939 --> 01:30:04,500
all the smalls that everybody left to

2169
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:07,620
ripen and they'd stick out in the cold

2170
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:10,139
and they'd turn dark and it was like all

2171
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:12,479
the under light under fed stuff that

2172
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:14,940
would happen and then they would cut

2173
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:18,119
that and put it into pounds so it was

2174
01:30:14,939 --> 01:30:22,500
the same price as the tops back then you

2175
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:25,139
know it just sucked but but it was still

2176
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:27,658
yeah people would really milk their [ __ ]

2177
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:30,060
and I didn't see not too many people

2178
01:30:27,658 --> 01:30:32,698
cleaned up their plants to try to make

2179
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:36,000
their tops the best

2180
01:30:32,698 --> 01:30:38,519
you know they would just pick those tops

2181
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,439
let those other things go until they did

2182
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:43,020
something and some streams really

2183
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:45,299
actually did okay with it and some of

2184
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,739
them would just [ __ ] out as soon as you

2185
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:49,079
picked on them they would everything

2186
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:51,599
else would be shitty but they would

2187
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:53,639
still pick it and sell it there was this

2188
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,500
aspect where people thought oh we can

2189
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:57,300
leave this stuff on and let it ripen

2190
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:59,579
because it's underdone it never got

2191
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:01,139
enough light we'll just leave it out and

2192
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,658
it's not gonna rot because it's too

2193
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:05,520
small yeah and then that stuff would

2194
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:07,859
ripen and turn colors because it would

2195
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,540
get pretty cold at night you know and

2196
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:12,679
then they would go out and harvest it so

2197
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:17,158
it was often like late batch under

2198
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:19,500
underground you know like remnants yeah

2199
01:31:17,158 --> 01:31:20,698
for the most part

2200
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,960
um

2201
01:31:20,698 --> 01:31:24,719
yeah

2202
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:27,300
yeah no it's fun I mean that that I mean

2203
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:30,658
being a hobbyist and living out here and

2204
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:33,900
just seeing all that [ __ ] it was just my

2205
01:31:30,658 --> 01:31:36,119
mind I was just the happiest boy in my

2206
01:31:33,899 --> 01:31:38,399
20s running around these Hills looking

2207
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:40,559
at as much [ __ ] as I could I thought it

2208
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:43,559
was great

2209
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:46,980
I can only imagine yeah man and being

2210
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:49,020
being that age and and like I obviously

2211
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:50,399
I lift my era because that would have

2212
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:51,659
been something I would have loved to

2213
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:53,460
have lived through so it's pretty cool

2214
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:54,779
to be able to pick your brain yeah and

2215
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:57,000
be able to sit here and ask you

2216
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:59,099
questions about it and kind of uh live

2217
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,198
via proxy through an error that I missed

2218
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:03,600
yeah I mean we're all born when we're

2219
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:05,339
born we all get our turn I know you

2220
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,039
still got to see cool or punk rock [ __ ]

2221
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:10,619
than I did too

2222
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:12,539
[ __ ] yeah and you know what I

2223
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:15,359
mean growing up in the town that I did

2224
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:16,859
there was it was almost Unthinkable that

2225
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,479
it could have happened it was just my

2226
01:32:16,859 --> 01:32:20,880
older brother and their friends I don't

2227
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,919
know how they stumbled on

2228
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,739
that's how I thought that's how I got

2229
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:27,658
sucked in too is was who became my older

2230
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:29,879
brother-in-law yeah me and the punk

2231
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:31,439
rocks even a little kid so yeah makes

2232
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:34,560
sense yeah

2233
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:36,658
yeah that was fun too and still was for

2234
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,820
all those years too moving out here and

2235
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:40,859
being able to run down to the city down

2236
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:43,259
to San Francisco and

2237
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:46,619
sometimes I'd see bands I knew from the

2238
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:49,860
Midwest played in San Francisco that was

2239
01:32:46,619 --> 01:32:51,658
always fun too just little reunions in a

2240
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:54,179
stream

2241
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:56,219
yeah is there anything else you wanted

2242
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:58,079
to cover Nato one of the things that we

2243
01:32:56,219 --> 01:33:00,899
could cover that kind of ties into what

2244
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:03,840
we were talking about is that both rings

2245
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:05,519
and I arrived in Mendo when it was I

2246
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,420
mentioned it before but when it was kind

2247
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:13,920
of poor and weird right and uh it was

2248
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:15,658
very odd place and you know and then you

2249
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,359
know people think too like people used

2250
01:33:15,658 --> 01:33:20,638
to come to Mendo all the time and be

2251
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:22,500
like oh my God wheat is legal

2252
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:24,659
and we did this thing where we passed

2253
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,698
this thing measure G which kind of

2254
01:33:24,658 --> 01:33:28,439
basically forbade the cops from messing

2255
01:33:26,698 --> 01:33:31,079
with you too hard if you only had 25

2256
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:32,879
plants and you had your paperwork and so

2257
01:33:31,079 --> 01:33:35,279
people would come to Mendo every week

2258
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,659
and be like wheat is legal I can do

2259
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:39,119
whatever I want

2260
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:40,859
and you would be like oh my God no like

2261
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:42,719
there's very much a cat and mouse game

2262
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:45,119
that goes on between you and your

2263
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,739
neighbors and where you're at what part

2264
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:49,679
of the county there was neighborhoods

2265
01:33:46,738 --> 01:33:51,000
that you could get away with it fine and

2266
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,279
there was neighborhoods where like

2267
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,760
retired doctors or lawyers or whoever

2268
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:59,219
would just report anything that they saw

2269
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:01,260
absolutely and if you didn't know like

2270
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:03,480
which streets and which areas were

2271
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:06,239
kosher and not you could come up here

2272
01:34:03,479 --> 01:34:08,539
and like way get like like in the wrong

2273
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:11,459
spot and yeah

2274
01:34:08,539 --> 01:34:14,340
amazing things was that you could go to

2275
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:16,219
the sheriff's department and buy 25 zip

2276
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:19,199
ties for

2277
01:34:16,219 --> 01:34:21,658
625 boxers you could yellow big yellow

2278
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:23,599
zip ties I mean my my eyes had chances

2279
01:34:21,658 --> 01:34:26,339
you're in the sheriff's department

2280
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,600
getting these zip ties from some old

2281
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:29,940
lady

2282
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,980
and you'd go and wrap them around your

2283
01:34:29,939 --> 01:34:33,658
stock and you just felt like [ __ ] the

2284
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:36,059
neighbors whatever they can [ __ ] all

2285
01:34:33,658 --> 01:34:39,119
they want if you got these things the

2286
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:42,600
cops and you have only 25 like you were

2287
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:46,380
you felt pretty empowered so that

2288
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:48,000
created probably I would say in

2289
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:49,639
I don't know I've been here four or five

2290
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,899
years or longer then so it was probably

2291
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:54,420
0.203 maybe it was when it really

2292
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:58,138
started what we call like the Green Wave

2293
01:34:54,420 --> 01:35:00,420
so probably like 0203 to maybe like 09

2294
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:02,760
there was just an immense wave of

2295
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:05,699
Outsiders that came into the county all

2296
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:07,980
at once buying up property they drove up

2297
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:09,319
the cost of properties by enormous

2298
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:13,198
amounts

2299
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:14,880
people really started blowing it up huge

2300
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:16,259
um it changed the culture of the place

2301
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,600
because anytime you get a bunch of

2302
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:20,820
Outsiders coming in too fast they can't

2303
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:23,120
learn from the people that were already

2304
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:25,738
there and so there was like friction

2305
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:27,300
between the people that had been here

2306
01:35:25,738 --> 01:35:29,218
for a while and the people that were

2307
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,600
just sort of like there was people that

2308
01:35:29,219 --> 01:35:33,420
were like

2309
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,460
I moved here I bought this land it's in

2310
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:37,739
the country which means I'm American and

2311
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:40,198
I can like fire guns and get drunk and

2312
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:42,539
drive 70 miles an hour up the thing and

2313
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:44,819
I can drain the community spring and I

2314
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:47,519
don't give a [ __ ] I'm growing weed and

2315
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:49,799
[ __ ] my neighbors and suck a dick and

2316
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,300
you'd be like oh no no no no that

2317
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,400
doesn't actually work well you know

2318
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:57,320
people yeah you'll end up in a hole

2319
01:35:53,399 --> 01:36:00,238
[ __ ] this is Mendo

2320
01:35:57,319 --> 01:36:06,299
of clones too that was the beginning of

2321
01:36:00,238 --> 01:36:09,059
like I the seeds the seed the past was

2322
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:11,820
just disappeared into clones at that

2323
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:13,980
time too and I I remember being really

2324
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:16,198
bummed because I knew I could see it

2325
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:20,759
happening I was like all this diversity

2326
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:21,960
is just going away to Barry White half

2327
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,860
goo

2328
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:28,198
and blue dream clones like all these

2329
01:36:25,859 --> 01:36:31,139
people all these people would have grown

2330
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:33,359
25 plants from seed

2331
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:37,500
any time before this but now they're

2332
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:39,059
just mono cropping one one

2333
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,198
and they you know they would come here

2334
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,820
and they would want to make a bunch of

2335
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:44,279
money a lot of them wouldn't even stay

2336
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:46,979
here over the winter you know they would

2337
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:48,238
come seasonally to make money in bail

2338
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:50,039
um and it changed the culture of the

2339
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:52,439
place it brought a lot of money and it

2340
01:36:50,039 --> 01:36:55,380
definitely improved thousands upon

2341
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:59,039
thousands of of rural properties that

2342
01:36:55,380 --> 01:37:02,279
got built up and made nice and Ukiah the

2343
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:05,639
hot main Hub I mean it it put a switch

2344
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:08,340
it polished the turd if you will oh I

2345
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:10,859
mean when I first moved Willets uh which

2346
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:13,639
is the town north of us and you in uh uh

2347
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:17,339
in Mendo was half of it was boarded up

2348
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:19,500
it had some really hideous buildings it

2349
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:21,179
was it was way on the downturn and now

2350
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:24,060
what's funny the reason why I brought it

2351
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:25,739
up is because we we've been talking a

2352
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:27,539
bunch about how we watched all these

2353
01:37:25,738 --> 01:37:29,819
people flow in

2354
01:37:27,539 --> 01:37:31,800
and now with the collapse of the wheat

2355
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:33,479
economy and the prices dropping to so

2356
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:36,179
crazy and everybody getting used to

2357
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:38,099
Growing volume which Rings hates and

2358
01:37:36,179 --> 01:37:40,079
growing a bunch of B and C grade wheat

2359
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:41,940
and just hoping it was good enough now

2360
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:44,100
all these people are flowing back out of

2361
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:46,379
the community because everyone that came

2362
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:47,639
in for easy money is like oh it's not

2363
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:50,359
easy

2364
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:53,039
Oklahoma bye-bye

2365
01:37:50,359 --> 01:37:56,099
yeah they were there was a lot of rich

2366
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:58,019
kids a lot of you know because I mean

2367
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:01,739
you had to have some it was either like

2368
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:03,960
big Hustlers from from cities all over

2369
01:38:01,738 --> 01:38:07,019
the country are rich kids because you

2370
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:09,840
had it still cost a lot of money to get

2371
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:12,540
a property and actually set it up

2372
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,679
and pay people and stuff like that you

2373
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:17,880
had to

2374
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:20,039
you know they had to you you couldn't be

2375
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:23,159
broke and come to Mendo and start a

2376
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:25,560
scene no you know they there's a lot of

2377
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:27,359
people up here that didn't want to admit

2378
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,000
that they got their parents to buy them

2379
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:31,380
properties

2380
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,939
and then they started blowing and then

2381
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:35,699
they started blowing it up and like

2382
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:36,839
going on vacations and I used to think a

2383
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:38,039
lot of those people I was like man

2384
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,079
they're just so much better at what

2385
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:42,359
they're doing than I am and then I

2386
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:44,219
realized that like their parents bought

2387
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:46,319
them like it was just play money to them

2388
01:38:44,219 --> 01:38:48,539
well I was trying to like live and

2389
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,460
survive and breed and do these different

2390
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:53,100
things and like there was no backstop

2391
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:55,260
like they had the parent that like put

2392
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:56,420
them put the property in their name they

2393
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:59,400
put the date

2394
01:38:56,420 --> 01:39:00,539
safety nets would be [ __ ] awesome and

2395
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:03,319
you didn't realize that none of them

2396
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:06,060
none of them really wanted to tell you

2397
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:08,399
right now we're going back to work for

2398
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:11,880
their mom and dad's corporations after

2399
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:13,679
15 years yeah they are bendo yeah of

2400
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,960
blowing it up in Mendo and a lot of them

2401
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:19,380
too to be honest they would come up here

2402
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:21,480
for two or three years and actually grow

2403
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:23,279
and then they would Farm it out to a

2404
01:39:21,479 --> 01:39:25,138
good friend or friends that weren't

2405
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:27,359
doing as well and still take a huge

2406
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:29,579
percentage but it was their property

2407
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:31,799
yeah and they would live in Santa Rosa

2408
01:39:29,579 --> 01:39:33,179
or the bay or Southern California or

2409
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:35,940
whatever and they would come up at

2410
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:37,859
important times to their property and

2411
01:39:35,939 --> 01:39:40,019
make sure it worked yeah but they

2412
01:39:37,859 --> 01:39:41,519
weren't really from here yeah they just

2413
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:43,020
kind of came up and blew it up and made

2414
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,760
some money and then left and then used

2415
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:46,139
the funnel to like funnel money to

2416
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,139
themselves so they could live where they

2417
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:51,600
wanted yeah we know lots of those yeah

2418
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:54,480
and so it's kind of getting back to like

2419
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,760
broken weird again in a way yeah which

2420
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,738
is painful to see but

2421
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:03,179
you know it's not like it's not like

2422
01:39:58,738 --> 01:40:08,059
Ukiah will turn back into uh poor town

2423
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:10,980
with a big factories on the edge of town

2424
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:13,199
you know exhaust over the whole town

2425
01:40:10,979 --> 01:40:14,519
it's it won't be back there because now

2426
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:17,279
it's just

2427
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:19,940
it's like the new affordable place for

2428
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:23,039
City people to put their money because

2429
01:40:19,939 --> 01:40:27,238
all the towns between here and San

2430
01:40:23,039 --> 01:40:30,600
Francisco are ludicrously expensive you

2431
01:40:27,238 --> 01:40:32,579
know like every time a person sells a

2432
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,620
house in town There's a person from the

2433
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:38,639
Bay Area willing to just buy it because

2434
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:41,460
it's only 600 000 whereas anywhere south

2435
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:43,859
of here it's 800 or a million for the

2436
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:46,260
same and so there's an aspect where if

2437
01:40:43,859 --> 01:40:49,198
you live in like The Valleys where where

2438
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:50,400
uh yeah where we live right now he's

2439
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:52,500
making fun of me because I got this

2440
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:55,679
verbal tick I got rid of one and then

2441
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:57,840
others came in my place but

2442
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:59,460
um there's part where around Ukiah

2443
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,920
around Redwood Valley around certain

2444
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:04,560
valleys the I think the properties are

2445
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,960
maintaining value but there's a lot of

2446
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:09,780
like mountainous properties that when

2447
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,399
people try to get them permitted they're

2448
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:13,259
just not permittable that without

2449
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:15,359
hundreds of thousands of dollars of

2450
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:18,179
improvements most of them don't even

2451
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:21,299
have enough water on them to grow a

2452
01:41:18,179 --> 01:41:25,679
garden I mean if people came up here and

2453
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:28,079
spent 350 000 buying a raw 20 acres that

2454
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:29,639
had no water on it and they set it up

2455
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,158
and buy water

2456
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:34,260
and have it delivered

2457
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:36,839
and now that the weed isn't bringing

2458
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:40,920
money what is that property worth really

2459
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,300
you know exactly sure and so there's a

2460
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:45,239
lot of things too and this is another

2461
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:47,400
kind of conflict in our area where the

2462
01:41:45,238 --> 01:41:49,559
regulations want people to come out of

2463
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:51,779
the traditional pot growing areas in the

2464
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:54,060
hills and they want them to come down to

2465
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:55,618
the valleys and like get legal on like

2466
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:57,480
AG land

2467
01:41:55,618 --> 01:42:00,238
and then there's a bunch of retired

2468
01:41:57,479 --> 01:42:01,618
doctors and lawyers and wine people that

2469
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:03,658
are like what do you mean there's a grow

2470
01:42:01,618 --> 01:42:05,639
down the street

2471
01:42:03,658 --> 01:42:07,319
I don't want to see that that's supposed

2472
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:09,000
to hide up in the hills I bought this

2473
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:12,719
retirement property it's all supposed to

2474
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,460
be rolling grapes and Orchards and not

2475
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:17,698
these degenerates with me I don't care

2476
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:20,460
do they have a permit well so um Sonoma

2477
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:21,839
County had a big problem you know at

2478
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:25,980
first when they were starting to go

2479
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:29,279
legal and I mean who owns Sonoma County

2480
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:32,218
Rich conservative wine Growers

2481
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:34,559
they were not into it and then some of

2482
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:37,439
those people were actually investing in

2483
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,780
weed once it really got legal oh yeah

2484
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:41,698
you know but they hated it before and

2485
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:42,840
and they probably still ate it but

2486
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:45,479
they're going to invest in it now to

2487
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:47,400
make some money money is money um but

2488
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:50,039
there's a as an aspect where you see a

2489
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:52,439
lot my my point to that I guess was that

2490
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:53,819
I'm curious in two or three years what a

2491
01:42:52,439 --> 01:42:55,799
lot of these Mountain properties look

2492
01:42:53,819 --> 01:42:58,559
like because the price of wheat has

2493
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:00,420
collapsed so much and it might cost

2494
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:03,300
hundreds of thousands of dollars just to

2495
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:04,980
fix your road so that like you know the

2496
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:07,619
fire department and whoever else will

2497
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:11,279
sign off on you having a a one license

2498
01:43:07,618 --> 01:43:13,559
growth and if it's if the angle of your

2499
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:16,679
road is more than 14 degrees you have to

2500
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,300
get it paved or this or this or this and

2501
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:20,699
so a lot of these places where it used

2502
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:22,800
to be traditional and good to hide and

2503
01:43:20,698 --> 01:43:25,618
grow Mountain weed and it's clean and

2504
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:28,560
it's pure up there it's not suitable for

2505
01:43:25,618 --> 01:43:31,139
the current form of legal yeah unless

2506
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,239
you get lucky very few of them had

2507
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:35,460
enough water they barely had enough

2508
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:38,339
water to just

2509
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:40,980
Supply a normal household

2510
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:43,319
you know let alone a big Garden out in

2511
01:43:40,979 --> 01:43:45,359
the out on the left you know so they

2512
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:47,099
were all trucking it in foot people in

2513
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:49,618
the last few years were spending trying

2514
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:50,940
to grow these 10 000 Square foots off of

2515
01:43:49,618 --> 01:43:54,420
bottom water

2516
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:56,638
they were spending like 1200 bucks a day

2517
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:58,380
or more I've heard about that people

2518
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,239
Trucking in water and people Trucking in

2519
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:02,340
water water trucks running around

2520
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:04,319
everywhere they're tanking I talked to a

2521
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:06,659
water truck driver I knew the other day

2522
01:44:04,319 --> 01:44:09,179
he's like ma'am

2523
01:44:06,658 --> 01:44:12,299
there ain't [ __ ] going on he's like I

2524
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:14,460
didn't make [ __ ] last year from it you

2525
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:17,159
know it's just over there tons of people

2526
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:19,439
bought water trucks it was all the rage

2527
01:44:17,158 --> 01:44:21,059
yeah there was enough profit in it that

2528
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:23,879
it made sense to do a lot of things like

2529
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:25,500
that you know and so I used to I used to

2530
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,179
have this running joke that like it'd be

2531
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:31,079
you'd find something and it'd be like a

2532
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:35,219
a composting toilet you know cute little

2533
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:36,899
Shack you know solar power 20 acres and

2534
01:44:35,219 --> 01:44:39,179
it'd be like 700 Grand

2535
01:44:36,899 --> 01:44:40,799
because people would be like oh you

2536
01:44:39,179 --> 01:44:42,840
could put 50 plants on that thing and

2537
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:45,239
make tons of money pay it off in a

2538
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,619
couple of years and so now what is that

2539
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:47,519
property going to be worth in a couple

2540
01:44:46,618 --> 01:44:49,738
years

2541
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:51,420
like the you know what what really is

2542
01:44:49,738 --> 01:44:53,099
that is that weird it doesn't have a

2543
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:55,618
septic it doesn't have this it doesn't

2544
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:58,260
have a that it's just a spot how many of

2545
01:44:55,618 --> 01:45:02,219
these people have moved here just had no

2546
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:04,440
idea how to like maintain a property you

2547
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:06,480
know like these properties are just [ __ ]

2548
01:45:04,439 --> 01:45:09,439
they're leaving them with just broken

2549
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:13,500
down carports and

2550
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:17,000
shitty Shacks they threw up real quick

2551
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:21,179
just to dry some plants and I mean just

2552
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:24,060
garbage tons of garbage you know on them

2553
01:45:21,179 --> 01:45:25,920
they're they're crap yeah there's a lot

2554
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:27,780
people leave a lot of garbage everyone

2555
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,480
thinks that like Mendo and Humboldt is

2556
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:32,479
this beautiful pristine place there's a

2557
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:35,039
lot of human garbage

2558
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,979
my friends from Santa Cruz would come up

2559
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:39,960
here and go man

2560
01:45:36,979 --> 01:45:43,638
why does everybody like having garbage

2561
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,639
out in their front yards up here

2562
01:45:44,779 --> 01:45:51,238
a natural repository for garbage yards

2563
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:54,658
too yeah Endo fashion is having some

2564
01:45:51,238 --> 01:45:56,000
sort of blue tarp ripped up and and you

2565
01:45:54,658 --> 01:45:59,819
know

2566
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,679
yeah it's normal around here

2567
01:45:59,819 --> 01:46:03,658
I mean there was places that we bought

2568
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,760
that we went in and like they would take

2569
01:46:03,658 --> 01:46:07,979
like an old barn or an abandoned cabin

2570
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,539
and they would just fill it with their

2571
01:46:07,979 --> 01:46:10,979
household trash because they didn't want

2572
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:12,960
to have trash service

2573
01:46:10,979 --> 01:46:15,238
yeah yeah and you'd have to put on like

2574
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,399
essentially a hazmat suit and you'd rent

2575
01:46:15,238 --> 01:46:19,678
most places we got a hold of in the late

2576
01:46:17,399 --> 01:46:21,658
90s through the mid 2000s

2577
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:24,300
one of the first things you would do was

2578
01:46:21,658 --> 01:46:27,539
get however many 40 yard dumpsters you

2579
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:30,600
needed yeah yeah and you could load 40

2580
01:46:27,539 --> 01:46:32,639
yard dumpsters with trash and some

2581
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:34,920
people would just make a huge pile and

2582
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:38,480
cover it with gas and set it on fire

2583
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:40,100
that'd be a big black [ __ ] black

2584
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:44,459
terrific

2585
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:46,679
oh God yeah people would you know it was

2586
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:48,560
uh it's an interesting spot but one

2587
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:51,300
thing that one million Whip It

2588
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:53,580
containers and all that kind of [ __ ]

2589
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:56,340
later I mean in the Whip-It containers

2590
01:46:53,579 --> 01:46:58,859
in the in the open blast era of butane

2591
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:00,600
it got really bad up here and people

2592
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:02,939
would do stuff where they got scared of

2593
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:05,460
throwing away thousands of empty cans of

2594
01:47:02,939 --> 01:47:07,019
Tain so they would like use a backhoe

2595
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,939
and dig a hole in the woods and just

2596
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:11,580
pour all the thing in there and drive

2597
01:47:08,939 --> 01:47:13,979
over it and then fill it back in

2598
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:17,579
that was I mean

2599
01:47:13,979 --> 01:47:20,279
I've seen a lot of them just left on the

2600
01:47:17,579 --> 01:47:22,859
side of the road huge piles thousands

2601
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:24,899
and thousands of butane canisters just

2602
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:29,099
left out in the beautiful Wilderness

2603
01:47:24,899 --> 01:47:32,099
with just a big massive pile of butane

2604
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:33,659
cans later you know I mean so there's an

2605
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:36,840
aspect to that where like that whole

2606
01:47:33,658 --> 01:47:38,579
open blast era uh which was probably

2607
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:42,000
eight or eight or ten years or something

2608
01:47:38,579 --> 01:47:43,979
like that yeah um it was a lot of damage

2609
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,158
you know there's a lot of dumping

2610
01:47:43,979 --> 01:47:50,698
there's a lot of those legs again on

2611
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:53,719
humans too you know some really bizarre

2612
01:47:50,698 --> 01:47:56,579
stories of humans melting as a

2613
01:47:53,719 --> 01:48:00,118
clandestine butane you're laughing but

2614
01:47:56,579 --> 01:48:02,760
