the microphone or maybe this is maybe

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,039

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,039
whole podcast

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,739
um like kind of the whole theme or

86
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,459
purpose of it really was to sort of like

87
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,099
share in a way uh how we Talk Amongst

88

89
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,598
because we you know and and bring bring

90
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,239
a little bit of that to like the

91
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,979
discourse or whatever right so

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
um so we're gonna talk about world

93
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,959
problems yeah

94
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,938
my buddy my buddy

95
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,340
is one of the people that I've talked

96
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,719
about uh all kinds of stuff for a long

97
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,000
time we live in the same small little

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,860
town uh we both come from the Midwest

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,360
like homie said

100
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,220
um he's actually been out here probably

101
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,979
four years longer than me or something

102
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,400
like that so over a quarter century and

103
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:34,439
so we've kind of both seen uh you know

104
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,000
like a lot of the different eras that I

105
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,500
think people would consider I don't know

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
if you want to consider him legendary or

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,418
just old

108
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,459
you know but also when we were talking

109
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,139
last show about like a lot of hobbyist

110
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:47,879
reading and a lot of multi-stage

111
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,639
breeding and learning about your plants

112
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,439
uh Rings is someone that has been you

113
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,780
know basically when we when you first

114
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,180
got here in the 90s

115
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,039
um that was the way it wasn't a clone

116
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,040
world it was a seed world

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,180
right yeah well not yeah I don't even

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,840
remember any popular clones for quite a

119
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,360
while

120
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,239
you know when I got here it was all seed

121
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,280
you'd hear about some indoors

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,540
here and there you'd see little batches

123
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,879
of indoor

124
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,319
here and there but there's a couple

125
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,860
lights

126
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,899
you know little bits yeah

127
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,340
and you know so there's an aspect there

128
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,198
where

129
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,659
um nowadays people view the kind of

130
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,780
breeding like that used to be done

131
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,639
around Mendo a lot just to have beans uh

132
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,978
something sort of mysterious

133
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,900
right well you know Rings basically

134
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:42,959
never left that era

135
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,819
in the sense of uh he always he has been

136
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,859
breeding kind of for what he likes

137
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,319
plants he likes things that interest him

138
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,939
you know regular breeding no feminized

139
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,399
reversals or anything like that maybe

140
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,560
some accidents now and again

141
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,339
um and just looking at what plants show

142
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,740
you

143
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,779
right so it really does tie into what

144
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,300
we've been talking about but it also

145
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,399
ties into like a whole era

146
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,079
um like pre-215

147
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,659
you know

148
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,639
um and even like after 215 passed it

149
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,919
probably took what Rings like

150
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,879
five or eight years

151
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:20,519
for I remember like

152
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,699
2002 people feeling like they actually

153
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,038
could lean on

154
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:29,520
215 even though it passed in whatever

155
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,959
year nobody thinks yeah nobody thought

156
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,439
they were going to be able to grow in

157
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:37,318
their yard not get [ __ ] with yeah so

158
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,300
they were still you know keeping it

159
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,280
mellow keeping it on the download but

160
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,079
then some friends of mine let her rip

161
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:48,179
they just went for it

162
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:51,060
and cops came people tried to rip it off

163
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,300
cops got called and the cops left the

164
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,339
plants and then we were oh it's a

165
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,300
[ __ ] green light

166
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:02,579
and yeah that was a major green light

167
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,860
so that was great though I mean for the

168
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:07,318
first time we were

169
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,879
putting them out in the sun and not

170
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,180
worried

171
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,418
and realizing the potential

172
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,220
that a plant could get real big so

173
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,620
chronologically speaking when you were

174
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,720
in Wisconsin what you were seeing out

175
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,098
there was what type of strains like

176
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,539
mostly were you seeing the afghanis

177
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,399
proliferated out there still pretty

178
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:30,899
heavy by the time you started

179
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:33,719
yeah I didn't really know I knew a few

180
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:36,719
few some of my older brothers buddies

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,360
were growing little gardens in their

182
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,419
apartments and whatever but

183
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,699
I didn't really know any outdoor Growers

184
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,258
there but you'd see the weed once in a

185
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,919
while come through

186
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,800
yeah uh but it was it seemed like it was

187
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:56,038
pretty standard kind of Afghani I mean

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,860
that climate back there you are limited

189
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,399
you know yeah that's true you could do

190
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,400
so

191
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,259
man what's that what were you seeing in

192
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,019
Wisconsin strain wise

193
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,419
you know people would say things like

194
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:15,120
Danny

195
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:18,899
I mean it was simple so basic not named

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,000
like this they were just stoked if you

197
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,939
got something that wasn't compressed

198
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,740
yeah right you know yeah and there was

199
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,418
there was two kinds of weed basically

200
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,519
there was green Mexican and brown

201
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:32,038
Mexican yeah and the level of

202
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,500
compression could vary widely

203
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,139
the best stuff was green and lightly

204
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,719
compressed the some of the worst stuff

205
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:43,139
was incredibly compressed and very Brown

206
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,680
yeah and strain names I mean you know

207
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:49,860
they just uh yeah I think I think uh

208
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,899
maybe maybe I'm speaking but

209
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,700
barely anyone knew what I was doing when

210
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,339
I lived in Chicago and was growing weed

211
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,680
absolutely

212
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:00,959
you were in a major populated area I was

213
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:05,219
in a rural area there was

214
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,799
it was all bad you could yeah they I

215
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,980
mean I remember just

216
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:14,278
people hearing about my friends and I

217
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,740
smoking weed and then like one of my

218
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,679
buddies got busted drinking and driving

219
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,820
and when he was in the cops they're like

220
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:26,159
we know you and that guy are selling

221
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,560
weed and oh you know I mean it was like

222
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,539
we were we were buying like a quarter

223
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,639
ounce once a month and smoking it in

224
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:35,338
one-hitters

225
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,179
we were so far away but I mean we were

226
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,760
like

227
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:41,039
dealers in our hometown because of that

228
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,519
of course people are asking about

229
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,740
various Imports I can't speak for rings

230
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,240
but we both come from the Midwest he's a

231
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,700
little farther north than I was and he

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,399
was Rural and I was City but I literally

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,959
saw Mexican and when the Grateful Dead

234
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,360
came into town there would be some kind

235
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,859
bud

236
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,080
there was no Jamaican Imports there was

237
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,659
no Colombian there was no tie there was

238
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,839
no anything named there was brown and

239
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:10,259
green Mexican I remember I got Thai

240
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,860
stick once and it was literally tied

241
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,958
with a string on a stick but I was very

242
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,039
fortunate where

243
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,299
I met the I I like to say the right dirt

244
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,179
bag

245
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:26,219
hippie biker types

246
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,500
that were older

247
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,320
and they weren't gonna smoke the worst

248
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,320
Brown weeds so they they had networks

249
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,278
set up somehow or whatever I was at

250
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,160
least getting like pretty

251
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,600
decent green weed pretty much from the

252
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,899
start

253
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,540
but that was I mean there was no weed

254
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,059
seen in my high school it was all just

255
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:54,179
drinking and there was a couple of

256
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,259
Stoners but there was no scene there at

257
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,399
that time

258
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:02,278
it just it just wasn't you know

259
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,500
go ahead you moved from northern

260
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,838
Wisconsin to our neck of the woods

261
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,578
Mendocino County you said was it was it

262
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:14,820
94 94 1994. right at Harvest time I had

263
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:17,159
no idea what I was even getting into I

264
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,019
just knew one person

265
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,899
came out here

266
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,539
within 20 minutes I was standing next to

267
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,600
a pot plant watching naked girls swim in

268
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,778
a pond it was it was like walking right

269
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,459
into a wet dream

270
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:38,059
I was already very into the hobby

271
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:40,379
I already had all the seed catalogs

272
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:44,399
memorized because I was buying High

273
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:49,919
Times and stuff and I had grown a little

274
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:52,559
um we've wired up a 175 metal halide my

275
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,899
friend rigged one together we had a few

276
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,919
plants and uh that I had saved some

277
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:00,539
seeds from uh some decent weed and we

278
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,299
grew them

279
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:06,480
some failed attempts at growing some

280
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:09,240
some Mexican seeds or whatever outside

281
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,180
that just went to [ __ ]

282
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,639
but yeah I mean it was very minimal

283
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,379
before I moved out here what was your

284
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,559
what was your impetus for coming out

285
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,559
here

286
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:23,819
I actually thought I was going to end up

287
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,720
in like New Mexico I kind of had dreams

288
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,700
of desert living when I left there and I

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,160
knew one guy here

290
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,360
and he was one of my hookups for good

291
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,620
weed

292
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,800
and

293
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,778
um mushrooms acid whatever

294
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,139
he

295
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:45,000
he he left I saw him and he was like I'm

296
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:48,480
moving out to California if you're ever

297
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,600
there here's my aunt's number she'll

298
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,700
know where I am and I got a hair up my

299
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,860
ass I was like I I had been all over the

300
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,079
country traveling with my family growing

301
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,379
up but I had never been in California

302
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,659
state line so

303
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:06,360
I I just thought I'd swing through but

304
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:09,719
like I said within 20 minutes all kinds

305
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,300
of just on to me unimaginable things

306
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,240
were unfolding in front of my eyes I was

307
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,099
just like

308
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,778
weird hippies you know I grew up in a

309
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:24,420
pretty conservative in a box type of

310
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:27,240
place there wasn't a lot of various

311
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:30,539
lifestyle choices and

312
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,000
diversity or anything like that so it's

313
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:35,399
like where I'm raised I get it this [ __ ]

314
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,559
is entertaining right away I mean

315
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,379
stories of weird hippies in the

316
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,899
mountains and Pagan groups and old

317
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,200
communes I was just like [ __ ] this is

318
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,539
entertaining right here

319
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,139
right and for me naked girls were a big

320
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:53,578
bonus

321
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,500
Francis it would have been the other but

322
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:57,379
oh yeah I see why you guys are drawing

323
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,879
that

324
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:02,220
so yeah but I mean a lot of times people

325
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,778
people think people think when they hear

326
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,940
a Mendocino County because now it's

327
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,860
super famous for growing weed

328
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,920
it's not that it wasn't famous for

329
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,019
growing weed already it's just that most

330
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,299
people's like earliest memory of like

331
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,820
Mendo now is like two is the two is the

332
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,500
medical era yeah when you had like a leg

333
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
to stand on and you could kind of there

334
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,458
was sort of a cat and mouse between

335
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,500
things but when we both first moved out

336
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:27,479
there it was a totally different world

337
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,019
in the sense of

338
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,039
like uh everybody that did it kept it

339
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,259
pretty quiet

340
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,719
there was a there was a number of people

341
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:39,480
in town that had successful businesses

342
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,699
and stuff that did it but they kept real

343
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,680
quiet about it it was done in the Hills

344
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,899
it was done tucked away people didn't

345
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,219
want people to know their money came

346
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:52,919
from wheat yeah showing the [ __ ] yeah

347
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,800
not so and I were talking about

348
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:58,019
the successful guys were driving beat up

349
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,439
old trucks you would have never known

350
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:03,659
they weren't there was no flash that's

351
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,339
for sure yeah we were we were talking

352
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,958
just the other day about it and there

353
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,800
would be guys that like were worth a lot

354
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,739
of money

355
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,599
and their truck would be old and a

356
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,440
little rusted and have a few dents or

357
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,659
whatever

358
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,019
and then like they pop the hood and the

359
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,519
whole thing is Chrome and super Cherry

360
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:22,919
souped up they've got a souped up like

361
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,720
they've got great suspension they've got

362
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,419
all this nice [ __ ] but it's like they

363
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,399
could drive through our crap little town

364
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,319
and look normal

365
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,940
yeah right because nobody wanted to

366
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,920
stand out nobody wanted to get targeted

367
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,920
and then even when 215

368
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,919
um it took like he said it took a number

369
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,180
of years for people to get a sense of

370
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,419
what you could do

371
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:51,059
yeah you know most of the people I

372
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,698
learned from and were was exposed to

373
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,399
they were older already then and had

374
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:59,519
been doing it for a long time

375
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,559
so they they they were they didn't even

376
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,720
they didn't even have

377
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,458
they didn't even have a fancy engine in

378
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,240
their truck you know they were just

379
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:11,338
chill they were just glad to to be

380
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,480
living up in the mountains and having a

381
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,540
home and

382
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,320
and be hanging out and being more

383
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:21,838
comfortable than a person working at one

384
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,879
of the local businesses or whatever they

385
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,459
were they were living good eat and go

386
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,740
Gotta realize too that Mendo was pretty

387
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,578
famous for being a huge logging

388
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,740
community

389
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:35,458
but that had sort of Fallen apart in the

390
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:39,360
80s and so I would classify it as pretty

391
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:42,419
poor when I first arrived very poor very

392
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,579
poor very run down so like even having

393
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,559
money was unusual like everybody that

394
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,719
had money was from some established

395
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,578
well-known family that owned businesses

396
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,339
in town yeah

397
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,379
you know yeah there was no there was

398
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,800
hardly even any weed around here

399
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,778
honestly I mean even though it was Mendo

400
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,198
and whatever

401
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:06,900
it would run out and if you were holding

402
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,199
something decent you were the man I mean

403
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,559
there really wasn't a lot

404
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,900
then no you know if you if you had two

405
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:18,298
or three patches in the woods and you

406
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,740
got away with one of them and you got 30

407
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:22,199
pounds

408
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,818
you were like loaded down with cash you

409
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,620
had a lot of loot you had whatever you

410
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,959
needed that year you were doing good you

411
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,719
were stoked a hundred and twenty

412
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,940
thousand bucks in 94 would have been you

413
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,700
know that's like that'd be like having

414
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,220
500 000 bucks now practically they'll

415
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,259
pay the prices were at that time for

416
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,839
land and homes and

417
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,480
stuff like that

418
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,819
yeah yeah those people

419
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,400
but yet they couldn't show it off so it

420
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:52,918
was kind of you didn't really know who

421
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,600
was holding I mean natso and I were

422
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,059
talking the other day and he met some

423
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:00,298
guy that had copious amounts

424
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:02,639
and he was living in a Shack in walking

425
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:04,918
around in his underwear all the time I

426
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,900
mean it's actually like I was telling

427
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,020
him it's probably like the wealthiest

428
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:12,298
person in wheat I've ever met

429
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:14,579
like I'm not even exaggerated I knew

430
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:16,259
exactly who he was talking about he was

431
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:18,298
the wealthiest person I I think I've

432
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:19,679
ever met in weed and he had a bunch of

433
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,740
huge scenes that I don't want to

434
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,160
describe but he had this like this queen

435
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,038
like black and white poly Shack

436
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,919
that like stretched like in between the

437
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,319
trees with rope right and he had a

438
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,799
really nice like teak wooden table in

439
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,418
this thing and he slept in it and he

440
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,000
walked around like he had a huge like

441
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:44,580
multi-pack of tighty whities and it was

442
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,119
hot up there and he would walk around in

443
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:50,899
his tighty whities and his boots and he

444
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:53,759
lived in a visqueen shack up on the Rock

445
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,340
and he literally like I mean he and he

446
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,240
sold like unbelievable I mean he made so

447
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,220
much money

448
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,259
yeah you know but it was just that was

449
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,259
his life he ran various things he didn't

450
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:05,879
leave the hill he and it was just hot

451
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,079
and he didn't like it so he walked

452
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,580
around and

453
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,379
you know it almost think you'd almost

454
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,839
think that like he escaped from like a

455
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,820
mental institution I can't I can't blame

456
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,159
the man I walk around like that in my

457
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:20,639
house and I'm not me too I'm still I'm

458
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,620
carrying the torch too but yeah I mean

459
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,320
in a way it's like if you busted that

460
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,058
guy like farts but you know he had

461
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,220
nothing

462
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,558
you know I mean he might own 15

463
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,900
properties yeah and have like

464
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,220
underground grows and generators and

465
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,200
this and that and everything else but

466
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,640
it's like you know it's like if they

467
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
came and got tried to get him it's like

468
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,759
he didn't have sports cars he didn't

469
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,400
have a nice big house he didn't have

470
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,839
boats he didn't have anything that they

471
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,640
could find

472
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,079
like and that's that's kind of like what

473
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,580
I was thinking about when when you were

474
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,439
talking about that Rings was like the

475
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:54,359
real Old-Timers around here

476
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,740
they just like to live up here and they

477
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,240
liked having enough money so they

478
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,980
weren't poor

479
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,779
and they didn't occur yeah they'd go on

480
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,880
vacations

481
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:05,639
yeah you'd meet a lot of like popular

482
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,620
kids and they traveled the world and

483
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,080
stuff but they weren't flashing anything

484
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,879
else like that was like their luxury

485
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,798
like their parents would help them

486
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,840
travel

487
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,058
so that was like that was more like

488
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,480
flashing wealth and Mendo kind of became

489
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:23,460
more of a 215 era thing definitely

490
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:28,079
because you had to like to stand on with

491
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:32,340
the with your you're legitimate yeah it

492
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:34,199
was the medical card to flash in the 90s

493
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:37,558
I think I would put it it was

494
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,319
Unthinkable I only know um a few people

495
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:43,200
that were probably dumb enough to flash

496
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,178
in the 90s and they ran a um

497
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,919
some kind of Hollywood Mansion they're

498
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,960
bringing actors in and out to show them

499
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,759
their little tiny [ __ ] grow I think

500
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,319
one of them went to jail and had Woody

501
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,400
Harrelson bail him out that's the only

502
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,019
people I could think of that were dumb

503
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,419
enough to flash like that like bring

504
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:00,480
people into a mansion with grows and

505
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:03,000
yeah they're not very common one guy

506
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,519
before I even moved here I mean they've

507
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,259
had documentaries about that guy and I

508
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,798
can't remember his name

509
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:12,538
he was one of the biggest importers in

510
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,079
the country he was bringing everything

511
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:19,859
in through the bay and he built on

512
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:22,798
Robinson Creek Road he built this big

513
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:25,079
mansion with like watchtowers on it and

514
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,538
hidden rooms and stuff and that happened

515
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,939
before I got here it was rural like his

516
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:33,179
house was pretty hidden

517
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,400
but it was pretty extravagant and he

518
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,960
went down he went down big and he's out

519
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,659
now

520
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,159
he actually just bought that Mansion

521
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:49,140
back from this guy I knew who owned it

522
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:51,299
but there was there was a um

523
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,480
maybe people should know that that like

524
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:56,940
so when I first moved out here I had my

525
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,620
my I literally had like just like rings

526
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,298
I had one friend that lived a little

527
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,819
north of Ukiah and that was like sort of

528
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:04,980
my landing spot where he got me situated

529
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,359
in the community

530
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,700
um and I thought it was going to be a

531
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,918
bunch of like Grateful Dead hippies you

532
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,480
know and back to the Landers and like it

533
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,159
was like I was from the city and it was

534
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,579
all these country people that lived

535
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,860
clean and beautiful and I got here and

536
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:21,480
there was some hippies but there was a

537
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:25,099
lot of weirdos there was a lot of

538
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:29,000
rednecks there was a lot of poverty

539
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:32,279
meeting a person that like like you

540
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,919
that just seemed mellow and like nice

541
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,779
and stuff was kind of rare it was a

542
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,659
rough crowd a lot of it I mean the

543
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:43,918
hippie side of it was pretty mellow

544
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:47,280
but I mean most of it was pretty Outlaws

545
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,620
I mean as far as quantities went those

546
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,259
those were people way out in the boonies

547
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,719
and they had guns and they were

548
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:59,179
you know I mean Tales of shooting at

549
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,179
helicopters and yeah

550
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:06,178
people out in the boonies growing a lot

551
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,159
they're gonna always been a way where

552
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,559
we'd allowed a certain amount of people

553
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,440
that have like a lot of [ __ ] mental

554
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:17,399
illness anger management and various

555
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,220
other ticks to like survive well but not

556
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,000
have to like like Smooth those issues

557
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,460
out

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,298
and so people were suspicious you know

559
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,100
there's aspects of uh of that you know

560
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:31,980
in the sense of it was just very

561
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:35,519
eye-opening like like once once logging

562
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,259
left this place was poor and so not only

563
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,418
we people think it was a weed Mecca

564
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:41,879
before the Mexicans took it over like

565
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,740
Northern California was also like where

566
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,320
lots of little batches and meth got

567
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,960
cooked so there was a whole underbelly

568
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,759
of meth people and there was a little

569
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,880
bit of a blending of the two communities

570
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,500
but not always but but you know there

571
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,419
was there there was various motorcycle

572
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,400
groups there was all kinds of weirdos

573
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,799
that owned land in the Hills I mean

574
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,140
because girls not populated growing a

575
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:07,200
lot of weed was always a lot of work and

576
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,179
I remember people way back then talking

577
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,759
about like hiring meth heads because

578
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:16,019
they would work you just keep keep them

579
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:18,058
High they'll dig 200 holes in the woods

580
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,579
yeah people steal all your [ __ ] when

581
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:23,460
you're not alone yeah and like you know

582
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:25,619
I mean maybe not if you had uh I mean

583
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,200
people did things like

584
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:30,719
tight Mountain lines in the middle of

585
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,700
their patch and chained them up to trees

586
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,679
I mean there was that checks out I mean

587
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,220
the stories

588
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:41,480
the Deep Well of bizarre

589
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:47,819
stories in this part of the world is

590
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:50,880
it's troubling funny you know very a lot

591
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,798
of disturbing stories you know it's I

592
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,840
mean actually it hasn't been very

593
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,460
violent around here the last few years

594
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,819
the murders

595
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,919
the partners shooting each other

596
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:05,220
seems like it's really tamed down

597
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,259
finally it has you know I mean you know

598
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,759
there was an aspect where there's

599
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,158
someone even older than us that I hope

600
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,960
to be able to bring on soon uh that can

601
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,700
speak of like the 80s but by the time

602
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,120
rings and I got here

603
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:22,740
you know Camp had been sort of hammering

604
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:25,259
the county for a good 12 15 years right

605
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,940
um you know there was a lot of back and

606
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:28,919
forth between that there was a lot of

607
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,440
sort of secret society like people

608
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,299
really kept to it to themselves it was

609
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,798
really hard to get accepted into certain

610
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,778
groups

611
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,778
um it was very it was a little paranoid

612
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:42,359
at a time and then on top of that

613
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:43,679
um you know let's face it right like so

614
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,719
you're getting four or five thousand

615
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,980
dollars a pound for your weed and you

616
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,659
have a whole bunch of money and it's

617
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,339
dark and it's cold and it's Mendo and

618
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,400
you're bored and it's winter

619
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,519
and so there was all kinds of scandalous

620
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,259
you know substance use

621
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,240
which was fun and some of which had

622
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:03,119
negative connotations for whole little

623
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,900
groups of people you know yeah YouTubers

624
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,000
on on some of the old Growers I met when

625
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,919
I moved out here they were like

626
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,200
in the 70s or whatever late early 80s

627
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,059
they'd be like things started getting

628
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,980
[ __ ] up they'd be like that's when

629
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:22,678
people started trading their weed for

630
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,860
Coke and then it became trading it for

631
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,740
meth you know and it just started

632
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,839
getting funky you know one of the first

633
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,900
guys I worked with told me basically

634
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,000
that exact story that when you get 4 500

635
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,759
or 5 000 a pound for anything that you

636
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,919
grow that's decent right he said you get

637
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,440
bored in the winter and then the one guy

638
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,080
gets a kilo of cocaine or something

639
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,220
right and he goes and he goes then the

640
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,859
problem is is five years later

641
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,419
everyone's cheating on everyone else

642
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:53,158
yeah you know people are messed up

643
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:55,140
people are this people are that and when

644
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,000
you got in trouble back then you either

645
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,340
went to jail for two or three or four

646
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,500
years usually or you had to knock on

647
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:02,399
your friends there really wasn't a

648
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,940
defense

649
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,000
you know so there's an aspect there of

650
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,500
like you know I mean there's yeah there

651
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
was you know there was there was opiates

652
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,740
there was every problem you could

653
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,140
imagine existed on some scale there

654
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,058
wasn't that many people yeah right so it

655
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,500
wasn't like it but there was there was

656
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:20,819
Partiers of all kinds and there was

657
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,919
people that were definitely into a bunch

658
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:25,259
of bad things sure

659
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,900
um and uh you know weed was a way to

660
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:28,859
survive and so like maybe on a positive

661
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,480
note

662
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:35,639
uh before we get too dark on that level

663
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,980
it does set the stage because I mean I

664
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,100
I'll tell a very quick story I remember

665
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,440
like I was hiking with friends and we

666
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,719
were up on this Majestic trail and I was

667
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,820
still pretty like new from from the

668
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,179
Midwest so even just Hills excited me

669
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:53,339
you know like big expansive trees and

670
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,778
stuff and I'm like oh I'm tripping and

671
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,939
I'm like looking out over this thing and

672
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:59,339
it's all beautiful and I look down and

673
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,440
there's like dozens of cars

674
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,658
that people it was like a spot that

675
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,400
people drove up to and just to get rid

676
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,440
of their trash they would push their car

677
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,778
off the ledge yeah and it would just

678
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,419
roll down the hill and and like the

679
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:15,480
hills were littered with this [ __ ] yeah

680
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:19,140
I was amazed when I moved out here like

681
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,419
every time you found a beautiful turn

682
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,820
off to stop and look at the scenery

683
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,140
there'd be like just trash below you

684
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:26,759
every time

685
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,100
because a lot of the country people

686
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,140
would just take their trash and drive

687
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:33,000
and be going down the road at night and

688
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,640
just bags of trash they would just throw

689
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,980
out their vehicle off off the hill bears

690
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,000
and so people so I was shocked because I

691
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,500
thought it was going to come out coming

692
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,400
from the city I was like I'm gonna come

693
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:48,259
to this clean pristine Place weed

694
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,640
growing hippies redwoods Oregon food

695
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:53,099
organic food all that and that was all

696
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,960
there in bits and pieces yeah but there

697
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,639
was all this other stuff that I had

698
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,980
never seen and you know it makes sense

699
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,380
because you know that that stuff really

700
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,240
started stopping when the weed money

701
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,580
really started changing the game to the

702
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,220
point where there wasn't so much poverty

703
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:11,519
yeah most of the houses that we bought

704
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,038
or got into or the land was very cheap

705
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,259
um most of it was very run down people

706
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:17,519
would do little indoors or do outdoors

707
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,619
and they would end up fixing the

708
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,859
bathroom fixing the roof putting on a

709
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:25,199
deck just taking like a falling down 50s

710
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:27,418
Farmhouse yeah that they bought on a

711
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,960
handshake deal and every weed crop

712
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,240
improving it yeah so many funky houses

713
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,220
out in the country around here

714
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,599
yeah tons I mean now there are a lot of

715
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,659
them are all fixed up and nice because

716
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,519
it had 20 years of of money coming in

717
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,500
even if they're shitty still they're

718
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,918
worth a ton of money at this point you

719
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,778
know it's true you know so but they

720
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,240
maybe we could talk about for a second

721
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:54,000
just to get go from like the Ambiance of

722
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,220
the area to like what were the what were

723
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,500
the the strains that you were seeing

724
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,899
when you first came out here and then

725
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,359
obviously like you know

726
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:05,158
um just so people know there was there

727
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,439
wasn't a lot of there wasn't a lot of

728
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,659
names back then a lot of individual

729
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,179
families and friends had different seed

730
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,860
lines maybe you could get a cockamami

731
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,019
story out of a few of them about what

732
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,178
had happened in the past yeah but

733
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,058
everyone Grew From seeds so people got

734
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,860
seeds from their friends and then every

735
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:24,480
two or three years or something they'd

736
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:26,099
be like oh I need some more seeds I

737
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,440
better like take some of these males in

738
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:30,500
the bushes and pollinate some of my

739
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,778
females yeah

740
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,700
it seemed like a lot of like the ranches

741
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:38,579
around here there'd be like

742
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,220
a couple of people that were into making

743
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:43,319
seeds and everybody else just got seeds

744
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,240
from them that was pretty common too

745
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,700
there was some people that were just

746
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,980
into it into that side of it

747
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,159
you know and everybody else would just

748
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,319
go to them buy starts from them or get

749
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,440
seeds from them that was pretty common

750
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,538
too there was there was still nerds back

751
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,580
then before we came out

752
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:05,158
yeah there was they were just harder to

753
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:06,658
find yeah you know and Matt and I have

754
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,220
had a lot of experience too with like

755
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,659
even people that we would consider to be

756
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,880
nerds today

757
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,080
you ask them about specifics of when

758
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,620
they were young

759
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:18,000
and they just don't have it yeah

760
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,459
they don't they just don't they just

761
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,038
don't remember it turned out good or it

762
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,558
didn't and even if it turned out bad it

763
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,058
was still worth the same um obnoxious

764
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:31,139
amount of money

765
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:32,519
you know it's still all sold yeah one of

766
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,460
the good things is it led to a lot of

767
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,139
diversity yeah right so I just want

768
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,538
people to know before we start chatting

769
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,700
about this that like lineage was often

770
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,038
hard to come by there was some like

771
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,558
poorly sourced legends about a lot of it

772
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,519
but everyone that was growing weed had

773
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,678
seeds

774
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,359
yeah and there was a lot of different

775
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,159
Hill seeds there was a lot of different

776
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,259
neighborhoods that had different seeds

777
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,580
because like Rings said there'd be one

778
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:57,960
or two guys that was like the

779
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:59,699
neighborhood nerd

780
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,558
and they would do breeding and then the

781
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,179
friends would get seeds from them and

782
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,240
stuff and so there was just a lot of

783
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,980
diversity yeah yeah you know a lot of

784
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,380
people just didn't even realize they

785
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,778
could keep a male and make seeds and it

786
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,899
wasn't wasn't that hard

787
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:18,659
you know they just they just thought it

788
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:21,298
was taboo to even have a male

789
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,919
anywhere around even though they could

790
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:25,079
have sold their seated [ __ ] for big

791
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,840
bucks even back then too as long as it

792
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:30,599
was green and trim decent

793
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:33,058
you know everything it's just that's

794
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,898
just the way it was then I mean you

795
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,898
can't say like

796
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,240
I mean that's why like with being into

797
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,599
the genetic side it was like when you

798
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,778
saw something good it wasn't all the it

799
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,839
wasn't even that often you know so if I

800
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:54,960
got something good I would be like

801
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:57,058
where'd you get this can I get this

802
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,519
I don't care where these are I'll drive

803
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:01,859
anywhere to get these seeds you know

804
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,839
just to try you might go you might drive

805
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:06,359
up to Oregon to get some seeds and come

806
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:10,019
back and pop them they're all Herms

807
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:13,139
you didn't you didn't know you know

808
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:15,538
so yeah and most people didn't keep we

809
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,679
lost most people didn't keep clones over

810
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:18,538
the winter

811
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,880
so it was like people would pop a

812
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:23,220
certain amount of seeds in Spring and go

813
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,899
through a process of sexing them and try

814
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,298
to figure out how many they thought they

815
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:29,518
could get away with yeah and then plant

816
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:31,740
females where they had to put them I

817
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,120
mean even I have a buddy who's uh who

818
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,399
was telling me like even some of the

819
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:39,599
first like hundred lighters he worked at

820
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:41,579
in southern humble right uh indoors they

821
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,678
were like literally like they made beds

822
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:45,178
on the floor and they planted seeds and

823
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,620
they went in and they cut the males off

824
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:49,259
at the base

825
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:51,839
yeah because it wasn't it wasn't a clone

826
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:56,179
world yet yeah so that's what they knew

827
00:33:51,839 --> 00:34:00,119
yeah I mean you hear a few stories like

828
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:03,840
like that orange thing you had yeah

829
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:07,199
Nintendo yeah being like an old clone

830
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:10,019
that was super rare I'm gone yeah that

831
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,398
was that was that's kind of unusual tell

832
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:12,539
us about some of your first breeding

833
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:13,980
projects that's what I want to know

834
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:15,719
about I want to hear about some of these

835
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,039
breeding projects this arrange what's

836
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,199
some of the first stuff you worked with

837
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,358
when you were actually like like I have

838
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,098
a [ __ ] goal I want to I want to end

839
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,659
up with XYZ like what's some of the

840
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:26,940
first stuff you worked with yeah it was

841
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,179
just looking at things like in the way

842
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,858
they appeared you know at that time I

843
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:36,200
was young and

844
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:39,418
and uh you know dense and shiny was

845
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:41,759
pretty pretty desirable you know and

846
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,940
it's funny to think back of how

847
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,580
sometimes you'd see something great and

848
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,918
you'd be like oh that stinks I would

849
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:52,559
never grow that but man does it smell

850
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,358
good because you didn't want you didn't

851
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,259
want your [ __ ] found

852
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:01,500
yeah and uh so it was more about just

853
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,800
like finding something

854
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,920
that would come in before the weather

855
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,680
that was chunky and decent to work with

856
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,838
you know we didn't want Sour Diesel buds

857
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:16,259
at that time even yeah you know we

858
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:19,078
didn't want to do that kind of trimming

859
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,359
so it was really about just making

860
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,000
something that was decent to work with

861
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,679
not super needy to it like you're

862
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,900
sticking [ __ ] way up in the mountains

863
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:32,338
and visiting it here and there yeah

864
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:34,800
you're keeping a close lengthy eye on

865
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:37,259
everything so you you didn't want

866
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,200
something that like I remember the first

867
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,079
time I grew like a skunk one type of

868
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:45,000
thing we put it up in the hills every

869
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,200
time we went up there it was [ __ ]

870
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,260
yellow

871
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:51,598
it just wanted [ __ ] you know and some of

872
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,700
this stuff we we had going would be dark

873
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,160
green and happy with virtually nothing

874
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:58,439
it would do all right I mean the plants

875
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,940
weren't big they didn't need a lot

876
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,358
because we weren't growing these

877
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,740
monsters they were yeah Quarter Pounders

878
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,920
under the

879
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:10,500
in the bushes you know yeah so they

880
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,960
didn't need a lot we would just bring a

881
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,320
bag of baguano up in the hills and some

882
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,320
water holding crystals and and the hope

883
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,599
that things went all right you know

884
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,240
water rules could be a dream dude water

885
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,338
water crystals used to be huge yeah

886
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,199
because you weren't able to get to yours

887
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:30,539
because most people hiked into their

888
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:33,598
site and it was far enough away from

889
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:36,480
your house or it was on uh because if

890
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,420
you only went once a week in the your

891
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,420
little water line some an animal [ __ ]

892
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:46,320
it up or something and they went six

893
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:49,680
days without water and 105 degrees

894
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,200
wasn't cool I mean we I I've said this

895
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,838
before but there's a there's a a big

896
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,598
like uh AG store I guess you'd call it a

897
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:00,179
garden store in Willits in Mendo called

898
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,920
spare time and they used to have you

899
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,419
used to walk into their front door and

900
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,260
they would have them you know they would

901
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,139
have a six foot tall stack of cases of

902
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,619
camo spray paint yeah because what he

903
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:15,539
was just saying is if you use soft poly

904
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:17,519
the rats the wood rats various other

905
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:20,159
Critters they'd smell the water and it's

906
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:23,400
so dry they'd come and they'd chew

907
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,739
through your poly to get [ __ ] hate

908
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,119
rats together you know to get water and

909
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,979
then all of a sudden your plants aren't

910
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,680
getting wet you know so people would use

911
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,199
some people would use PVC but then it

912
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,299
was white so you needed to spray paint

913
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,879
it to make it look like the ground cover

914
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,339
yeah right before you put it together

915
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,720
because otherwise like you know and then

916
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:44,940
they couldn't they could smell it but

917
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,799
they couldn't chew through it yeah it

918
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,858
was amazing how

919
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,720
how Camp was back then too like they

920
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:57,539
would find like they took their time and

921
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:58,559
scanned the hill so closely they would

922
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,440
find

923
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,559
like a few little plants in the bushes

924
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,440
they'd take their time and just work

925
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,179
areas I remember diving in the bushes

926
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,639
when I first moved I I thought it was

927
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:14,399
cool as [ __ ] like all the government is

928
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,879
trying to find people like us we're

929
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,440
diving in the bushes and I thought that

930
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,440
was cool as [ __ ] yeah

931
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:26,519
I mean there's an aspect too people

932
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,619
don't get that's why like everybody take

933
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:30,619
a shot every time not so says aspect

934
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:37,800
you people would hide them in the trees

935
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,599
like on little on on I never did that

936
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,359
but I had friends who would put them on

937
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,480
on you know raised Platforms in the

938
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:47,819
trees because the the uh helicopters

939
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,139
they'd be looking at a certain line and

940
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,760
they a lot of times their eyes would

941
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:53,940
miss it or they'd put them along the

942
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,980
line of a tree line or manzanitas you'd

943
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,380
hollow out branches and you'd still

944
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,719
leave the top cover and hopefully they

945
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,039
would make it but they were after it so

946
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,899
hard

947
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,880
um you know you really had to be careful

948
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,460
and then you would take different ways

949
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,320
to get to your spot often like it's not

950
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,659
like you drove your vehicle there or you

951
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,420
drove your ATV or whatever you didn't

952
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:17,460
even want to walk no the same pathway

953
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,680
because they'd see the path from the air

954
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,900
so you would take different routes to

955
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,179
get there and get in and get out you

956
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,480
know yeah you walk on the animal Trails

957
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:29,279
real carefully to not make them look

958
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,619
weird from the air

959
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,560
yeah it was fun to try to camouflage

960
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,960
things and and it was fun to be a little

961
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,000
ninja I mean we weren't even doing much

962
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,500
it was just worth something and and

963
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,260
really

964
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,920
we were just into it you know we were

965
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:50,040
into the plants we wanted to have some

966
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,460
we were willing to hike up mountains to

967
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:56,039
get a very little a bit you know it was

968
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,500
y'all are [ __ ] nuts dude I couldn't

969
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,358
take that kind of heart trauma like

970
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,880
going up and watching like you know

971
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,279
eight of your big [ __ ] rips like you

972
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,019
plant one for thieves plant one for pigs

973
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,720
and plant one for you like that's the

974
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:11,599
theory [ __ ] that I mean that was so

975
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,459
dramatic

976
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,480
even in spring when you're like setting

977
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,480
it all up

978
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,099
that's when you're digging your holes or

979
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,838
you're bringing in your if you're not if

980
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:24,180
you're not using the right the Earth

981
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,000
there that's when you had to hike in

982
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:28,858
your you know your your your soil you

983
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,599
had to bring in your amendments so you

984
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:32,578
could feed even if you were using native

985
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,099
Earth it was hard to feed on nothing run

986
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:37,320
your water lines maybe drill a spring

987
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,359
and then you're crawling in the bushes

988
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,760
carving out little spaces for your

989
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,039
patches that whole drill is spring like

990
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,839
people my age like from California we

991
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,259
don't even get what the [ __ ] that means

992
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:51,900
drill a [ __ ] spring yeah put in a

993
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,060
spring box so so the spring collects

994
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,780
water in the spring box and then run

995
00:40:54,059 --> 00:41:00,420
piping from that box sometimes hundreds

996
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,460
of yards especially if you're downhill

997
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,380
you would try to find water witching

998
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,800
[ __ ] to find the spring that's how you

999
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:10,200
do this I mean there was little springs

1000
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,880
on properties you would you would like

1001
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:16,500
build a box and then just rig up a pipe

1002
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,320
going out the end it would collect a

1003
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:22,139
little bit and just slowly trickle I

1004
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,079
mean a lot sometimes we had them feeding

1005
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:26,819
little tanks or something but because

1006
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,619
you needed Springs because you it's not

1007
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,599
like you could put in a well

1008
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,059
because even if you had solar or

1009
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,519
something like that they'd see it yeah

1010
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:37,259
so I don't even like I just don't get

1011
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,880
how people found Springs out in the

1012
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,160
[ __ ] mountains like how did you find

1013
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,420
these things under the ground for wet

1014
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:48,659
spots I met people that knew Rings were

1015
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,059
you know or or found properties where

1016
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:53,819
there was like little hidden parts of

1017
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:56,699
the property that had a little water

1018
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,920
source yeah yeah and basically a spring

1019
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:01,858
box is just digging a hole big enough to

1020
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,780
put a certain size like man-made box in

1021
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:05,759
there that's going to collect the water

1022
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,680
and let it build up to a usable amount

1023
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,800
and then you can drain it out one end

1024
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:13,379
and then the gravity feed yeah gravity

1025
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,039
feed it yeah for the most part yeah it's

1026
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,039
up started

1027
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:30,000
low low grade to somewhere it was tricky

1028
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:33,239
to get the bubbles out of those lines I

1029
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,059
remember working on that very hard

1030
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:38,578
yeah lots of hiking back and forth to

1031
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:40,139
see if it worked now or not you know

1032
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,859
that's a great question was there ever

1033
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:47,338
turf wars over Springs

1034
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:48,838
[ __ ] man hell yes there was I was

1035
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:49,920
thinking about that I was thinking about

1036
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,900
that when

1037
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,838
when 215 happened I mean a lot of I you

1038
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,539
don't hear this talked about very much

1039
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,420
so all these water sources in the

1040
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:06,179
mountains people kind of had them that

1041
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:10,079
was kind of their Turf you know they had

1042
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:14,279
those spots and when 215 happened

1043
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:18,079
the cartels came with guns and pretty

1044
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,780
much kicked everybody off their spot and

1045
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,760
what it but 215 was allowing all the

1046
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,800
people that had those spots to do it

1047
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,200
right in their [ __ ] yard then so it

1048
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,859
was like a little transfer

1049
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:33,598
of territories or whatever Out of the

1050
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,759
Woods yeah

1051
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,818
but I mean people used to there used to

1052
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,160
be a thing where you know I mean people

1053
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:43,139
would have arguments over how far away

1054
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,239
the patch should be from your home so

1055
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:46,920
that if they did Camp it they would just

1056
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,899
take the patch and not mess with you

1057
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,818
yeah and there would be arguments about

1058
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,200
how much you should hike and how far

1059
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:53,940
away

1060
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,460
um and so it's not like it was just like

1061
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,440
off in the bushes you know 100 yards

1062
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,780
from your house a lot of these things

1063
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,240
you'd hike into or hike up to and it

1064
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,519
would be a good distance away and that's

1065
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:09,539
why the little how like the little

1066
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:12,420
Trails were so like we really had to

1067
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,159
think about that stuff you did if they

1068
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,500
saw a trail they'd just walked right to

1069
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:19,019
it and there would be you know you had

1070
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,420
to really ninja that stuff

1071
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:22,920
and be careful you know so yeah it's

1072
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,500
like I remember like a lot of times

1073
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,079
especially when I was hiking up like uh

1074
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,239
dry amendments or something like that in

1075
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,460
the spring I would just want to puke

1076
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,739
because you're like going uphill and

1077
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,199
you've got like a 50 pounds of food on

1078
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,639
your back and you're hiking and then you

1079
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,838
know you get to mid-summer and it

1080
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,219
doesn't even feel like anything because

1081
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,619
you're in shape and you've done it for

1082
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:45,779
months super in the beginning and that

1083
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,838
was as a young buck I'd be like oh my

1084
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,040
God this is [ __ ] rough so another

1085
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:52,858
thing that's kind of funny that people

1086
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:56,519
should know is that for me it's like you

1087
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:59,279
use something like uh like fish meal or

1088
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,780
bone meal or blood meal or something and

1089
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,380
then all of a sudden you realize like oh

1090
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:07,019
that attracts Bears yeah

1091
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,720
you know yeah and bears are some kind of

1092
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:10,858
big animal comes in looking for what

1093
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:13,199
smells

1094
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:15,719
because you've got composting fish meal

1095
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,519
or composting crab meal or whatever and

1096
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,919
then a big ass bear starts to dig in

1097
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,539
your soil and ruins your patch yeah

1098
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,180
because you use the wrong kind of

1099
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:26,460
fertilizer yeah I think the people I

1100
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:29,159
learned from right away was it was like

1101
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,539
bakuano right away because they were

1102
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,759
kind of hippies

1103
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:34,559
but then a lot of people who didn't care

1104
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,339
about that kind of stuff they use those

1105
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,960
little osma coat pellets oh yeah balls

1106
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:42,420
and they would just put those in there

1107
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,539
and that would be done all they had to

1108
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,338
do was just Add Water

1109
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:49,500
time release I mean there were some

1110
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:51,358
people that once you I mean and I'll say

1111
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,219
this too there was people that had

1112
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,920
established spots that they were able to

1113
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:57,659
do small patches in year after year and

1114
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,358
so some of those people had some really

1115
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:03,059
nice soils some really nice holes they

1116
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:06,239
amended them well every year so it was

1117
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:08,099
like an active organic situation and so

1118
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,858
there was some better pot that came out

1119
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:14,720
of those well in the line it up sucked

1120
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:14,719
the water was really good

1121
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:21,779
really affected the weed back then too

1122
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:24,719
people aren't using city water

1123
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,780
treated water it was just like Mountain

1124
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,299
Water you know and just like any other

1125
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,400
living thing

1126
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,980
the quality of water is it makes a

1127
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,680
difference you know it had minerals in

1128
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,900
it it had little bits of stuff in it

1129
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,818
that's where I learned too that the old

1130
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,940
timers always taught me that pot was

1131
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:46,500
like a lateral root growth plant and so

1132
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,500
they would always say like in the bushes

1133
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:52,500
it's better to dig like an 18 inch or a

1134
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:55,318
two foot deep hole that was wide

1135
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,639
rather than one that was deep you know

1136
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:58,980
they're like the plant's going to want

1137
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,559
to go wide and you'll get more weight so

1138
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,539
like make a shallow a depression and

1139
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,920
fill it in rather than just digging like

1140
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:07,259
a I mean there was people that would dig

1141
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,079
like four five six foot deep holes but

1142
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,819
that would have been me

1143
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,099
dude it's such a [ __ ] you're like

1144
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:16,500
crawling in the manzanitas with like a

1145
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,880
shovel that can strap to your back and

1146
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,940
then you're underneath there and you're

1147
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,318
just like chomping at them six feet with

1148
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,900
the tiny little and then you gotta like

1149
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,940
that and then glad I was young at that

1150
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,980
stage I mean because nothing [ __ ]

1151
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,960
mattered you know yeah you just got it

1152
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,880
done or whatever but it wasn't easy and

1153
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,800
then you had to remove this the you know

1154
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,440
like because a lot of it a lot in Mendo

1155
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,440
is red clay it's not like we have like a

1156
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,079
ton of black loamy deep rich Earth that

1157
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:46,019
you can just like plant into it's like

1158
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,640
mountainous and Rocky and clay-like and

1159
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:49,318
so you definitely had to add some stuff

1160
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,519
to it and amend it if you wanted to get

1161
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:54,119
anywhere it's not like you could just

1162
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:57,300
like dig a hole and plant yeah

1163
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,640
yeah let's get into strains guys people

1164
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,720
want to hear about the strains oh God

1165
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:06,480
okay so it's always so funny because

1166
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:08,519
without clones to reference people it's

1167
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,480
like you're just telling them about a

1168
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,739
ghost

1169
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,440
you know

1170
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:15,358
like a little bit a little bit you know

1171
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,240
but I had a moment today where I was

1172
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:20,940
harvesting some volunteer accidental

1173
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:24,059
thing that popped up in my yard

1174
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:27,059
and uh the rain got it it was the only

1175
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:30,059
early thing I had and it it had some big

1176
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:31,940
soft colas on it and the rain kind of

1177
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:35,400
started getting to them a little

1178
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:38,639
botritus yeah

1179
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,740
and I'm smelling the piece I picked a

1180
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,858
few days ago and I'm smelling it I'm

1181
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:46,618
like this smells just like afghan's 30

1182
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:48,960
years ago what was it do you remember

1183
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,160
what the volunteer was from yeah it was

1184
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,059
uh

1185
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:57,779
some cookie cush crap across with my

1186
00:48:54,059 --> 00:49:00,059
blue Dynamite Super Lemon OG crap that

1187
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,579
guy had one male last year so it had to

1188
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:05,639
be from that male I can dig some blue

1189
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:07,920
Dynamite crap over cookie cush [ __ ] you

1190
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:09,900
know people hate cookies and I don't

1191
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,900
like what it stands for either but

1192
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:16,079
ultimately if it's gassy and it has a

1193
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:19,139
good I mean if it's gassy it it's still

1194
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,539
decent smoke I mean sure I can't stay

1195
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:24,059
high off it I can't I can't stay high

1196
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:26,159
off it has no legs for me some of it

1197
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:28,500
strong and some of it's not and

1198
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,019
sometimes I when I first found cookies

1199
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,159
like forum and animal and tried those

1200
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:37,500
things I actually appreciated

1201
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:40,858
not being so [ __ ] I don't need to get

1202
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,318
Sledgehammer [ __ ] freaked out stoned

1203
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:46,980
all the time sometimes I want to yeah

1204
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:49,679
you know but I mean I was high I just

1205
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:52,858
wasn't just because I'm not tripping the

1206
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:56,098
[ __ ] out I'm not high you know not

1207
00:49:52,858 --> 00:50:01,019
everything has to have me [ __ ] just

1208
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:03,359
feet for me like I get I Get High like

1209
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:07,318
it's a good height for 10 minutes and

1210
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:09,358
then it's just like yeah so that's fine

1211
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:11,159
if you gotta go pick your kid up from

1212
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,338
school and that happened a good point

1213
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,318
that is a good point

1214
00:50:13,338 --> 00:50:18,000
there are times and I talk about this

1215
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,279
with rings quite a bit actually where

1216
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,619
like I'll smoke something like that my

1217
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,720
headband like the LA and I'll go into

1218
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:26,460
town stupidly like I've done this

1219
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,679
hundreds of times to myself over the

1220
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,300
years I'll get all baked on the wrong

1221
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:31,739
thing and I'll go into town and I'll be

1222
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,359
standing in line at this weird little

1223
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:36,779
store and it'll be like the Twilight

1224
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:41,338
Zone in line and I'm like why right am I

1225
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:43,440
here history storm great oh no but one

1226
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:46,139
thing I will say about cookies

1227
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,220
is that I don't like cookies that much

1228
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:50,159
either

1229
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:51,480
um but but two things about it one is

1230
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,838
that since we were just talking about

1231
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:58,019
the gorilla era I would have flipped out

1232
00:50:54,838 --> 00:51:00,599
to have something cookies what came out

1233
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:01,980
in the wrong era if we would have had

1234
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,559
that [ __ ] in the gorilla era because

1235
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,619
cookies requires low light

1236
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:10,740
it's super dense right it doesn't have

1237
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:12,358
to get that big to weigh a lot of food

1238
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:15,539
it doesn't need a lot it doesn't like

1239
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,519
food it doesn't like sunlight so I could

1240
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:21,119
have put it in a deep shade

1241
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:23,699
not fed it very much and just loaded

1242
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,260
Manzanita patches with cookies and it

1243
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:27,419
would have came out to come in early

1244
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,579
enough to not mold oh it would have been

1245
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,318
great it would have been great yeah a

1246
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:33,839
lot of a lot of the things people are

1247
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:36,420
growing when I moved out here did not

1248
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,639
come in early not everybody grew

1249
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:41,519
specifically for early that was kind of

1250
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:45,838
my own like mission was to create

1251
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:48,838
something like early that was strong and

1252
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:52,139
looked good and decent to work with and

1253
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:54,119
and stuff like that but a lot when I

1254
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:55,858
moved out here I was hanging out on a

1255
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,280
mountain and people were

1256
00:51:55,858 --> 00:52:02,940
were uh bringing in [ __ ] baseball

1257
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,500
colas from the for out of the rain in at

1258
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,900
the end of October

1259
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,838
you know and the people I learned from

1260
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:12,420
were really good and that was

1261
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:15,420
they knew how to let things get there

1262
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:18,059
they weren't gonna freak out and pull

1263
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,940
[ __ ] yeah you know they really they they

1264
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:23,700
taught me a lot of stuff for like I I

1265
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,519
just got lucky and met people that

1266
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:30,239
really were into it and

1267
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:32,460
and cared about it and were also down to

1268
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,439
take their time to show me some stuff

1269
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,679
and tell me why

1270
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,800
they did this or why they didn't do that

1271
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:43,259
there was a lot of of just Hill weed

1272
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,619
that had a good amount of sativa in it

1273
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,660
of all kinds back then yeah and it took

1274
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:51,180
a while like there's a lot of weed that

1275
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:53,639
didn't finish until say like late

1276
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:56,039
October to early November

1277
00:52:53,639 --> 00:53:00,118
um but it resisted the rain pretty well

1278
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:02,460
and Mendo most Falls there's a lot of

1279
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,380
warm dry fall in Mendo

1280
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:07,500
you know it might rain for two or three

1281
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,318
days and then be sunny for weeks yeah it

1282
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:13,019
just depends you know so there was a lot

1283
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,719
of Sativa weed and because all the weeds

1284
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:17,400
sold there wasn't like I think what

1285
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:19,578
started with the purple craze and then

1286
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,660
you know the various things is is

1287
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:24,599
everyone started getting the same

1288
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:27,598
cuttings and blending them this era is

1289
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,940
the total opposite of that like all

1290
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,099
kinds of random unique weed some of it

1291
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,019
pretty Mitzy but all kinds of different

1292
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:38,338
stuff just floated around because all

1293
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:41,639
weeds sold yeah and every every smell

1294
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:42,960
you can imagine today was already there

1295
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:47,519
back then

1296
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:50,338
you know who you if you took the time to

1297
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,019
see as much as possible which I was into

1298
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:54,719
if people were like

1299
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:56,219
I was just into it you know I was just

1300
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,919
like oh somebody's got some different

1301
00:53:56,219 --> 00:54:00,899
[ __ ] I'll go and look through it and ask

1302
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,700
him questions if I like some but I

1303
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,220
remember smelling

1304
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:09,899
super intense cherry

1305
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:14,098
back back then Super intense lime all

1306
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:17,039
the earthy skunky Afghani smells

1307
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:20,880
and just just kind of a little bit of

1308
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:23,159
everything and all different Leafs

1309
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,619
all different kinds of [ __ ] you know

1310
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:27,838
talk about some of the the most unique

1311
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:29,460
[ __ ] that you remember seeing um during

1312
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,318
your early days there what some of the

1313
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,858
most not necessarily by name but

1314
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:37,139
describe it if you can yeah

1315
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:40,440
I mean I keep on thinking about this

1316
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:43,019
this some stuff that uh

1317
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,599
my friends grew it actually down in the

1318
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:47,579
Watsonville and uh I had a girlfriend

1319
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,960
down there that was going to college so

1320
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,099
I was down there a lot when they were

1321
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,559
doing it but

1322
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:54,420
one of the guys was ex-military he had

1323
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,119
friends up in Humboldt

1324
00:54:54,420 --> 00:55:00,659
and they had some little gorilla thing

1325
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,818
in a canyon in Watsonville

1326
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:05,159
and when it was done he brought us all

1327
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:07,318
this stuff and it was just like sativa

1328
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:11,338
you know and there was

1329
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:13,920
there was there maybe it was kind of

1330
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:15,960
purple but it wasn't it was like great

1331
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,119
and these guys knew how to cure things

1332
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,480
beautifully they were really into it

1333
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:26,700
they took their time they cared

1334
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:29,219
and we had called it gray bud and one of

1335
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:31,318
the one of those two sativa strains was

1336
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:34,980
called Golden Lion so somebody up in

1337
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:36,960
Humboldt would recognize that name

1338
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,719
yeah Golden Lion and

1339
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,559
and uh you know I just figured it was

1340
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,939
from some Rasta crew up in Humboldt

1341
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,200
and uh

1342
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,880
but

1343
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:53,759
I remember that gray Bud

1344
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,200
my friends and I smoking it and like not

1345
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,480
even talking

1346
00:55:55,199 --> 00:56:02,639
like we just left our [ __ ] bodies and

1347
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:05,760
it was [ __ ] amazing but

1348
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:08,219
the most memorable things to Thai

1349
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:12,119
Afghans from spyrock one of the first

1350
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:16,618
things I saw that just had everything

1351
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:18,599
Beauty smell really wild highs and stuff

1352
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:21,119
I remember my buddy would take his

1353
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:24,140
scissors hash and it looked like what we

1354
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,519
called monkey's blood opium it was like

1355
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:29,159
translucent red

1356
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:31,440
and I remember smoking that and being

1357
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:34,679
sitting on the ground and just holding

1358
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,900
the ground waiting to come just to get

1359
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:41,239
my bearings it was so potent but the

1360
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,240
those Thai Afghans blew me away

1361
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:47,039
um you know all these characters were so

1362
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,500
funny low bird the guy who called

1363
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:52,818
himself lobert a weird

1364
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:55,920
jungle monkey from Hawaii growing

1365
00:56:52,818 --> 00:57:01,079
Hawaiian sativas in their in the like

1366
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:03,000
94. he had great stories of swazi's and

1367
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:06,960
he said all him in the old heads they

1368
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,900
liked swazi's that was like the the gold

1369
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,179
in Hawaii in like the early 90s or

1370
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,639
something interesting yeah I never got

1371
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,779
to see that he grew some Hawaiian sativa

1372
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,799
seeds here

1373
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:22,200
and would bring the plants in every

1374
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:25,079
night because they weren't going to get

1375
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:27,239
done until I think he harvested them at

1376
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:30,300
Christmas they were [ __ ] great they

1377
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:33,239
take they had really floral sweet smells

1378
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:35,160
really nice some of them had really nice

1379
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,019
little shade of purple in them some of

1380
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:39,139
them stayed green no matter how cold it

1381
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:41,400
was yeah you know

1382
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:44,759
and some of that too is like because

1383
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,039
weed was was that so valuable then it

1384
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,839
was a lot easier to dry and handle

1385
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,599
things if you wanted to in a really nice

1386
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:53,880
way because there wasn't so much of it

1387
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,818
like it wasn't some overwhelming amount

1388
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,960
of [ __ ] you could treat it nicer you

1389
00:57:56,818 --> 00:58:00,000
know

1390
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,099
um and uh and that made a difference too

1391
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,960
one of the things maybe we should note

1392
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:05,519
is that

1393
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,039
um when you get pounds or you'd see

1394
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,079
pounds most of them were all mixed

1395
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,960
phenos

1396
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:15,180
yeah because they weren't from clone so

1397
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,338
you would get there would be pounds and

1398
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:19,980
they would be all the same line

1399
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:21,900
you know but they would trim it up and

1400
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,159
they would blend it up and you'd be

1401
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,720
looking at this and this would smell

1402
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,940
like that and this would smell like that

1403
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:29,039
and then you'd be like oh wait what is

1404
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,019
that one and then you start digging in

1405
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,818
the bag looking for weed that looks like

1406
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:34,500
that and picking out I try to gather

1407
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:37,440
yourself a little pile and you're like

1408
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:40,739
that one right there we always joked we

1409
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:45,298
always joked how people would uh there'd

1410
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:46,858
be like an over ripe purple bud in a

1411
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:49,798
mixed bag

1412
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:51,298
that had no resin on it just smelled

1413
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:53,579
like garbage because it was way over

1414
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:55,739
ripe and somebody would see a pound

1415
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:58,318
they'd focus in on that one they'd be

1416
00:58:55,739 --> 00:59:02,279
like look at that purple

1417
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:04,139
oh [ __ ] yeah maybe we just laughed

1418
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,819
because it was garbage you know that

1419
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:07,739
would probably be me not all for me

1420
00:59:05,818 --> 00:59:09,119
would be doing that but yeah but I mean

1421
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:10,979
there's an aspect too and then some

1422
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,079
people would be like oh some of these

1423
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,539
pounds are kind of midsy but these

1424
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:18,359
plants are really flavorful so we're

1425
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:20,940
gonna take a few ounces and put them

1426
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:22,858
into into the top of each of these

1427
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:25,260
pounds so that when people open the bag

1428
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:27,000
there's like a nice selection and it

1429
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,520
makes them think that the whole bag is

1430
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,280
like that but really it's like these are

1431
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,420
nice and the rest of them are just okay

1432
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,700
and but it all went because people

1433
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:39,180
wanted good weed there was it wasn't

1434
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:41,578
hard they didn't have any options to get

1435
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:43,558
better weed there was you know there was

1436
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:47,880
no like you weren't getting rejected

1437
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:51,780
yeah if you just dried yourself stuff

1438
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,760
nice got kept it green got it dry enough

1439
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,500
to where it wouldn't turn yellow right

1440
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,160
away

1441
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:02,099
your [ __ ] was was golden you know I mean

1442
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:04,739
it was really appreciated by people

1443
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:07,200
whatever it was sometimes I remember

1444
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:09,358
that one time I grew that skunk one it

1445
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,399
was funny because people are like this

1446
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:15,980
[ __ ] is weak

1447
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,980
and they were just bummed on it

1448
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,900
I can imagine I I've heard similar

1449
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:23,759
experiences recently with another option

1450
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,980
they didn't have money and they're

1451
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,440
spending 50 bucks on an eighth even here

1452
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:30,719
in Mendo you know if they took a smoked

1453
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,460
a you know they would Brash and [ __ ] out

1454
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,439
if they were taking a couple hits of

1455
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,838
something and not getting tore back they

1456
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,460
were kind of bummed well and also one

1457
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:41,460
thing that that I don't know if a lot of

1458
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:44,940
people realize seeds prices probably

1459
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:47,760
have instead of inflation risen have

1460
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,500
maybe dropped now compared to what they

1461
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,660
were they've always been pretty

1462
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,519
especially Scentsy they've always been

1463
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:55,259
pretty expensive for the time they've

1464
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,298
dropped massively because if you think

1465
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:00,059
about the purchasing power

1466
01:00:57,298 --> 01:01:03,298
of what that the seed cost hasn't

1467
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:04,440
changed all that that much you know but

1468
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:06,380
I mean obviously there's some people

1469
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,720
that have some hype that try to like

1470
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:13,740
counter inflation or whatever but

1471
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:16,500
um you know for me imagine buying seeds

1472
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:18,659
from Europe back then you know like some

1473
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,059
of my older brother's friends went to

1474
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:23,519
Europe and brought back seeds in the 80s

1475
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:25,619
and stuff and they had their little they

1476
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,838
lived in Metro areas you know

1477
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,519
Minneapolis things like that and they

1478
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:33,960
would have their little closet grows

1479
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:37,559
about 400 or a couple 400s or whatever

1480
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,900
and so they had that Dutch stuff but

1481
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:41,880
you know when I moved out here I was

1482
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,760
just like man it didn't seem like that

1483
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:47,640
Dutch stuff even mattered out here but

1484
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,619
it did everywhere else you know I mean

1485
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,259
most of the Dutch stuff was imported

1486
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:54,240
from either California Washington or the

1487
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:56,880
Pacific Northwest so they didn't really

1488
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,019
have a need to go to the Dutch to get a

1489
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,240
[ __ ] up version of what was already

1490
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:03,358
there yeah you'd never I never heard

1491
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:05,879
people say like oh we went to we put

1492
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,460
Northern Lights in this or we put skunk

1493
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,019
one in this it was like it was mostly

1494
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:12,358
older stuff

1495
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:15,179
and it really didn't have much which I

1496
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:16,858
appreciated I already was a total nerd a

1497
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:19,679
High Times nerd

1498
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:22,558
I knew all those strains I lusted at

1499
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:25,379
wanting to try them and stuff but here I

1500
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,019
was able to try some Northern Lights and

1501
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:30,119
skunk Northern Lights mixes at my

1502
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:34,079
brother's friends had made and my other

1503
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,519
one of their friends grew G13 clones in

1504
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:39,000
their early 90s

1505
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:41,099
and I I got to smoke that but most that

1506
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,260
was yeah they were actually the first

1507
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:44,880
crew I knew that didn't clones they kept

1508
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,280
stuff if they had a great plant they

1509
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,680
they kept it they were into their

1510
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,200
gardening there was actually this crew

1511
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:54,179
from before I even moved out to Mendo uh

1512
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:55,798
from Wisconsin

1513
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:57,480
um that had this they called it

1514
01:02:55,798 --> 01:03:02,639
blueberry skunk

1515
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:04,858
and I used to get it in 93 94 95 96. I

1516
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,420
never was able to get a clone of it out

1517
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:09,000
in California

1518
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:11,579
but they had little you know in Madison

1519
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,019
and some of these rural areas outside of

1520
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,000
Madison they'd have these little four

1521
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:16,619
and six lighters and they would all grow

1522
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,739
this blueberry skunk that's what they

1523
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:21,539
called it yeah and it was really

1524
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:22,739
attractive I have no idea what it was

1525
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:24,179
related to

1526
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:25,919
um and I never grew it myself but I got

1527
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:28,919
buds of it

1528
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,619
um and uh you know but that what's

1529
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,720
interesting about that too is that when

1530
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:36,119
when you when you found somebody that

1531
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:39,118
was intelligent in the sense that like

1532
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:41,220
they cared about the intelligent as the

1533
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,900
wrong word I'm sorry when they were when

1534
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:44,759
they cared about lineage

1535
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,440
yeah when they were [ __ ] autistic

1536
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,359
nerds like us right when they cared

1537
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,639
about lineage not intelligence but just

1538
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:52,199
like a weed nerdism to like they'd tell

1539
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,779
you something like that like oh it's a

1540
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:56,818
Mexican with a swazi or it's a Colombian

1541
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,940
mixed with some afghan that we and they

1542
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:01,858
get you know but most of it was the name

1543
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:04,440
of the closest Little Mountain or town

1544
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:06,179
that it came from when I first moved

1545
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,318
here there was so much weed that was

1546
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:12,000
like oh this is from whitethorne

1547
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:13,858
this is from the hills above kovalo this

1548
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,579
is some Sherwood Road this is some Long

1549
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:20,279
Valley this is some you know some Alder

1550
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:22,318
Point weed and it was just named kind of

1551
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,619
by the little town or the little area or

1552
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:27,960
the little Hills that it came from yeah

1553
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:31,260
yeah more than anything nobody wanted

1554
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:34,500
their names associated with anything

1555
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:36,839
you know and so when I brought out the

1556
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,239
Maui because I you know I brought out

1557
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:42,358
the Maui and the Crystal chunk to

1558
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:44,759
California because from Chicago that was

1559
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:46,739
all we knew was like the only reason why

1560
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,319
you started seeds was to find a killer

1561
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:51,179
clone and then you use the Clone yeah

1562
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,920
you know we were all indoor and stuff

1563
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:56,098
like that so

1564
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,318
um you know and so I came here and

1565
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:00,180
clones like you said clones were rare

1566
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:03,920
people were shocked that I was like

1567
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:06,598
running rooms of the same thing yeah

1568
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,400
Keepers were just planes that were kept

1569
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,460
because nobody kept [ __ ] you could have

1570
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,798
kept anything and and if you had those I

1571
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:16,679
mean there just wasn't many clones I I

1572
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,679
you know I always think of your Maui

1573
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,679
afghoo

1574
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:25,679
um what else yeah we had the afgh up

1575
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:28,858
here Matt oh yeah big time it was early

1576
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:31,139
incredible it looked like indoor because

1577
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:33,358
it was so resonance and stuff so it's

1578
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,940
very popular because it came in at a

1579
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:38,460
decent time Outdoors too it had it has

1580
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,900
amazing terms too unless you get sick of

1581
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,298
it because pretty much everything with

1582
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,858
Africa smells like after and you can get

1583
01:05:42,298 --> 01:05:47,400
sick of it if that's all you're smelling

1584
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:50,179
like that cantaloupe weird mangoey I

1585
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:54,119
loved it there was a Northern Lights

1586
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:58,019
blueberry I think that went around here

1587
01:05:54,119 --> 01:06:00,660
that smelled it either was the same or

1588
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:04,139
it smelled very similar

1589
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:05,578
early on back then and that was that was

1590
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:07,139
sort of like when you when you did a

1591
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:09,180
bunch of outdoor seeds and stuff like

1592
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:12,058
that that was my first experience with

1593
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:14,460
like oh wow there really are dominant

1594
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:16,140
traits you know and I remember some of

1595
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,880
my first meetings thinking that I could

1596
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:20,279
breed away from certain things I wasn't

1597
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,358
fond of and breed towards other things I

1598
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,099
liked more

1599
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,019
and then sometimes that worked really

1600
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:27,420
well and I Pat myself on the back and

1601
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:30,719
sometimes that trait was just ingrained

1602
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:33,539
and I was like oh I can't get rid of it

1603
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:34,919
you know it's just part of it you know

1604
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:37,980
like you were saying things like half

1605
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,119
goo smell like AFCO or terpenolene or

1606
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,920
something like that you know like

1607
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:43,740
there's things where you're like oh I

1608
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,720
can't get it out of there yeah yeah I

1609
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:48,058
remember getting really sick of after

1610
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:50,459
pounds because I was born I just thought

1611
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:52,380
all clones were like great to see and

1612
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:55,199
maybe they were great to smoke here and

1613
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:58,260
there but as far as the mission I was on

1614
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:00,179
it was all clones were boring unless he

1615
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,760
just made seeds with them and then the

1616
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:05,818
seeds you grew out of them were fun you

1617
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,880
know like I just wasn't a clone guy ever

1618
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:11,759
pretty much like I loved sour so much

1619
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,619
that I kept that for a long time and a

1620
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,559
lot of times having

1621
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:18,780
other friends hold it at times or this

1622
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:21,599
or that I kept it around because it was

1623
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:24,359
just like a daily driver to me like just

1624
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,619
a something I like smoking and we could

1625
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:27,298
talk about the top three favorite

1626
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:28,680
strains but I'm not sure I can get any

1627
01:07:27,298 --> 01:07:31,199
strain names out if we could actually

1628
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:33,480
talk to them about that yeah I mean I

1629
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,159
know all the Clones you know I always

1630
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,500
hung out with people that grew the

1631
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:39,239
clones and enjoyed them and stuff I mean

1632
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:42,000
as far as like things that are

1633
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:44,699
identifiable there certainly is some

1634
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
something not even identifiable I just

1635
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:49,980
mean like top three favorite smokes not

1636
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,260
even necessarily strains but smokes

1637
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,880
events would smell like taste and like I

1638
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:55,680
mean that's really like they're stray

1639
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,180
names there's identifiable stuff and we

1640
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,460
use that so other people know exactly

1641
01:07:57,179 --> 01:08:00,779
what you're talking about yeah you can

1642
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,639
transcend that just by talking about

1643
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,099
what it smelled like tastes like the

1644
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:07,500
highs maybe top three interjects just

1645
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:09,960
really quick though is that before we

1646
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,659
get away from it which is uh

1647
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:16,739
there was two sour diesels I saw early

1648
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:18,420
on one is the one that I still have

1649
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:20,519
um which I've talked about before but

1650
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,859
then it was this other one that that

1651
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:26,100
Rings was much more familiar with that

1652
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:29,759
existed that was took longer was more

1653
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,679
feathery uh harmed more was more

1654
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,539
delicate so you could talk about that

1655
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,480
for a minute because the sour that I

1656
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:39,179
ended up keeping was one of two that I

1657
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,039
saw and the one that he had was much

1658
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:42,838
different but we but it was it was

1659
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,399
spread around back then but it was

1660
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:47,579
significantly different in growth

1661
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:49,019
pattern and it had a similar nose it was

1662
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:51,600
definitely similar but it was very

1663
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:55,699
different in growth yeah we considered

1664
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,699
it to be like Piney

1665
01:08:55,738 --> 01:09:00,358
um

1666
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:02,579
I mean it it was that I mean the whole

1667
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:05,100
sour thing was just crazy how it just

1668
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:08,539
took off I mean the first time I got it

1669
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:13,259
actually was from a guy um Mean Gene

1670
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:14,880
uh knows two he grew up near him

1671
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,859
um

1672
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,440
the guy gave it to me and I was like

1673
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,539
this [ __ ] is ugly because still at that

1674
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,178
time everybody basically wanted

1675
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:25,859
something dense round with a lot of

1676
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:29,579
resin on it

1677
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:31,920
and my buddy handed me the sour and I

1678
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:34,920
was just like [ __ ] this shit's all

1679
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:39,000
feathery as peach colored hairs on it

1680
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:41,399
and just looked weird to me but

1681
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,960
as soon as we smoked it it was just like

1682
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:47,399
I remember looking at it and just being

1683
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,500
wow this is going past what the norm is

1684
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:53,219
like this it was the first like

1685
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:55,738
commercial thing that didn't look like

1686
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:58,500
everything people wanted for a long time

1687
01:09:55,738 --> 01:10:00,899
dance round Chris Lee blah blah blah you

1688
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,819
know it was just such good smoke it

1689
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:04,799
would make people forget about those

1690
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:07,139
other things they thought they desired

1691
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,279
so I thought it played a really good

1692
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:11,039
role

1693
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:14,460
in that like kind of breaking down some

1694
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:18,238
walls that were just always there

1695
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:21,840
like it it didn't always look great in a

1696
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:24,119
bag you know sticky little

1697
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,880
fluffy

1698
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:29,219
I mean it really you had to hit it right

1699
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,079
to get a lot of resin on it but even if

1700
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:34,020
it didn't have a lot of resin on it had

1701
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:37,460
big flavor and it had that Zippy high

1702
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:37,460
that was real clear

1703
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:46,800
would cry

1704
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,420
because they wanted that big the stuff

1705
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,000
that he was just talking about all that

1706
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:52,699
big chunky resonance that stuff's easy

1707
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,140
to trim and people can get through it

1708
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:57,779
sour gets popular and a bunch of people

1709
01:10:55,140 --> 01:11:00,719
are growing that cut and it's feathery

1710
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:02,698
and shitty and loose and sticky and you

1711
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:06,420
have to be all gentle with it to not

1712
01:11:02,698 --> 01:11:10,439
[ __ ] it up it would give trimmers why

1713
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:12,300
they were [ __ ] doing it what yes you

1714
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:15,359
would have to go a little sour

1715
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:18,539
introduced Psychotherapy to trim bossing

1716
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,979
because you had to like convince your

1717
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:22,279
trimmers like this is going to be worth

1718
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:24,899
it please do this I know it sucks

1719
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:28,019
because it was a struggle it was like

1720
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:29,879
sometimes it looked ugly outdoor I mean

1721
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,520
it still had all the Terps and the Good

1722
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:35,880
Buds and stuff like that but it

1723
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,500
it did not form up into a piece you know

1724
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,960
but then I saw some people growing in

1725
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,640
greenhouses and feeding it intense food

1726
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,619
you know we are kind of more on the

1727
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,260
hippie organic side so we weren't

1728
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:48,179
dropping big you know we weren't

1729
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,920
throwing grow more on it or anything

1730
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:52,980
like that you know

1731
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,079
so but I remember people pulling a lot

1732
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:57,059
of different looking stuff out of that

1733
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:59,460
same clone just by the way they were

1734
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:01,620
feeding it for sure they could get some

1735
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,939
pretty big dense bugs out of it if they

1736
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:04,939
nuked it with food

1737
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:12,479
you know but I mean top three strains

1738
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:14,819
I'd almost say sour sour sour I mean

1739
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:18,479
there wasn't and I'm not I'm not really

1740
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:20,039
that attached I'm into keeping on moving

1741
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:23,879
and seeing

1742
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:26,460
what comes out of these seeds that I've

1743
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,300
collected or bought or whatever over the

1744
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,340
years

1745
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,560
I don't I don't really get that attached

1746
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:34,800
they all get me high there's certain

1747
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:38,520
highs I like better yeah

1748
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:41,340
but I'm willing to have a bad Buzz just

1749
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,140
to try something new you know there's

1750
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:45,900
something I don't like I just like to

1751
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:48,360
keep moving because I want to see planes

1752
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:51,539
that's it's kind of I was a hobbyist

1753
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:54,479
when I got into it it was just like more

1754
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:56,460
plants all from seed preferably just so

1755
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:58,439
I could it was like information to me to

1756
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,619
go to those kind of Gardens and just see

1757
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:03,299
Expressions see different

1758
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:04,920
Tendencies you know you could after a

1759
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,039
while you're just like oh that's heavy

1760
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:11,100
Afghani at this guy's Garden you know or

1761
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:12,539
I think that's that's something like me

1762
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,300
and Caleb and a bunch of other people

1763
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:17,399
that that are are big into

1764
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,039
identification through Visual and

1765
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:22,319
bringing for traits and and all that the

1766
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:25,079
one advantage that we had was seeing a

1767
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:27,359
lot of different strains and like I told

1768
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:29,939
you the other day my mentor

1769
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:32,960
um uh hog he would always tell me like

1770
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:35,759
you you want to learn you learn by by

1771
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:38,760
growing the bass lines baselines

1772
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:41,100
baselines Northern Lights skunk one Haze

1773
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,659
you want to grow as many different types

1774
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,760
of afghanis as you can you want to grow

1775
01:13:42,658 --> 01:13:46,619
as many ties as you can in Mexicans and

1776
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,360
Colombians you don't if you don't grow

1777
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:50,939
those you don't know [ __ ] about pot and

1778
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:53,339
that's what he told me yeah that's cool

1779
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:56,099
that's good yeah it's a good place to

1780
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,420
start and you see you know one one of

1781
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,100
the things that always interests me when

1782
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:01,560
I when rings and I are in one of our

1783
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:03,600
many combos is that there's certain

1784
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,179
lines that he's been playing with for a

1785
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,980
very long time and then you really get

1786
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:10,739
to see because you've crossed it to a

1787
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,419
lot of different things what are the

1788
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:14,819
traits that are dominant that keep

1789
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:16,739
popping up what does it give to crosses

1790
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:18,779
you know there's things that he'll be

1791
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:20,819
like to me he'll be like you know a lot

1792
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:23,219
of people don't like this line but

1793
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:25,319
here's four things that I just love that

1794
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:27,779
it just throws in its progeny all the

1795
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:30,840
time and so I kind of lean towards it

1796
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:32,698
you know because of these things you

1797
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,640
know and there's stuff he's done like

1798
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:37,439
you know we did um it's gotten Pat we

1799
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,659
you know we did a little a little collab

1800
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,399
if you personal collab where he had some

1801
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:45,179
you could talk about this he had some

1802
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:46,920
old Maple Leaf uh Indica from Scentsy

1803
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:48,239
seeds and that era where they were still

1804
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,179
selling it

1805
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:53,819
um that we blended with a bunch of stuff

1806
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:55,980
um blue Dynamite uh you know there's

1807
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:57,960
been you know sours and cushes and

1808
01:14:55,979 --> 01:14:59,579
various different lines

1809
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,859
um and I base you know he makes seed

1810
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:03,300
basically every year yeah so some of

1811
01:15:01,859 --> 01:15:04,920
this stuff someone was asking in the

1812
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,380
comments when did you first get blue

1813
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:10,739
Dynamite

1814
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:13,739
2002. I said early 2000s but yeah that's

1815
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:16,738
when I got sick of just kind of

1816
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:19,799
freeing my stuff to itself over and over

1817
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:23,819
and kind of just being like okay this

1818
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:25,560
stuff has this kind of range and and I

1819
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:27,960
want to see other people's [ __ ] I want

1820
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,760
to see what these people in Canada are

1821
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,520
[ __ ] with or

1822
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,280
or whatever and I'd read about Maple so

1823
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,020
I ordered some maple seeds and it's

1824
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,880
funny because I've bought in so many

1825
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,400
things over the years to check them out

1826
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,859
all these things that I hear old

1827
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:46,319
schoolers talking about the only things

1828
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:48,779
I really have that are still fresh and

1829
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:51,059
poppable in my collection to this day

1830
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:53,519
have blue dynamite in them or Maple Leaf

1831
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:56,520
in them everything else is just come and

1832
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,760
gone and it's not that I think those

1833
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:01,320
things are are the greatest or this or I

1834
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,000
mean none of it's the greatest to me

1835
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:06,238
it's just all

1836
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,880
more more more I just want to see more

1837
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:11,399
plants but they were reliable they were

1838
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,859
reliable to do what they did yeah

1839
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:16,139
you know the maple was great it wasn't

1840
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:17,819
very good looking generally it had a

1841
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:20,640
nice smell and it had a great smoke

1842
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:22,439
ability that's why I liked it you said a

1843
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,539
lot of terpineline Expressions but there

1844
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:27,119
were some cushy and they're or more

1845
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:30,000
dense Afghani type yeah I remember when

1846
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:33,719
when Nazo and I did that little collab I

1847
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,179
remember Caleb hit him up and said do

1848
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:40,500
you see any actual maple

1849
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:42,840
leaves yeah yeah had one I had one I

1850
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,658
sent it I sent it to him you know yeah

1851
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:47,400
that's cool yeah yeah and I mean we we

1852
01:16:45,658 --> 01:16:49,920
kind of we kind of did like a little

1853
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:51,839
open pollination with that not that it

1854
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,840
was very big I think we got

1855
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,179
four boys and three girls to pop out of

1856
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,100
some of the old seed but we let them

1857
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:02,520
pollinate each other like crazy and then

1858
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:06,060
we threw in a bunch of like uh clones

1859
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:11,219
that I like uh yeah if I you know chems

1860
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:15,300
chem 91 chem D Mendo p uh the tanjo the

1861
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:17,698
super silver haze the headband uh you

1862
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:19,460
know just a a collection of stuff

1863
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:24,000
because

1864
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:25,800
G from seed in there I threw a few

1865
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,119
things from seed in there too and I've

1866
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,760
grown I mean

1867
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:32,939
not so as in part many of those but I've

1868
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,619
popped I've seen hundreds and hundreds

1869
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:35,839
of plants out of there

1870
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:40,800
um

1871
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:44,760
the Loompa headband Maples and I had a

1872
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:48,000
Karma G I had let go and a buddy of mine

1873
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:51,020
wanted to would you say that Karma OG

1874
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,020
never heard of her go ahead

1875
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:57,779
what was interesting it was really cool

1876
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,579
I had a buddy a few years ago call and

1877
01:17:57,779 --> 01:18:02,279
he was off the grid and he was like I

1878
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:04,979
want to just dap a whole bunch of

1879
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:07,139
seed stuff can I get some seeds so I

1880
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:11,339
gave them tons

1881
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:14,640
and I gave them the Lumpa headband with

1882
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:17,219
the Maple and the caramel G I had made

1883
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,440
with the Maple and it was it's like the

1884
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:21,239
classic OG story where they're all kind

1885
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:24,359
of the same even though they got all

1886
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:26,639
these names those two rows those two

1887
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:28,319
rows they might as well Bend from the

1888
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,659
batch same batch of seed there was

1889
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:33,000
basically like two main expressions and

1890
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:34,979
they looked like each other you know so

1891
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,840
that's why I like running seeds you get

1892
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:39,899
to just see that kind of [ __ ] you know

1893
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:41,400
yeah I crossed um I the other day I was

1894
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:43,259
trying to add it I was some like nine

1895
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:45,179
different OG's to the Blue Bonnets just

1896
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:48,060
to see how each different one combined

1897
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:49,260
to the same exact mail then that was

1898
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:51,480
pretty true breeding throwing the same

1899
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,640
expressions and there there was very

1900
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:57,000
little variance I mean like mostly like

1901
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:59,219
the sfv and the Louie and all that you

1902
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,979
can't it's hard to tell them apart yeah

1903
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:04,679
yeah they're so similar and I mean sure

1904
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:07,619
there was a little different smells and

1905
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:10,199
stuff you know in the different cuts but

1906
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:14,158
the genetic there whatever was in them

1907
01:19:10,198 --> 01:19:16,619
wasn't that far apart exactly yeah

1908
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:19,198
and you know I mean I don't know it it's

1909
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:21,539
interesting in that regard because uh

1910
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:23,879
you know just so people know too it's

1911
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:25,619
not like I don't think that those maple

1912
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,679
seeds that we used were like from the

1913
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:30,719
original pack they had probably been no

1914
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:32,760
they were used a couple of times they

1915
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,520
were they they were just spread to

1916
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:38,159
themselves several times to just keep

1917
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,280
them going I mean

1918
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:44,299
that was 15 years after I bought them

1919
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:48,300
what was the medwoman

1920
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:50,340
medwoman who brought oh yeah bad dude I

1921
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:54,000
couldn't believe he posted a picture of

1922
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:57,360
this medwoman medwoman was a Northern

1923
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,409
Lights something if you look it up

1924
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:01,619
it won a contest up in Oregon

1925
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:04,920
[Music]

1926
01:20:01,619 --> 01:20:08,219
or Washington years ago and it won for

1927
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:10,440
being like a good medical strain I had a

1928
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:12,719
buddy up in Eugene

1929
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:16,559
that sourced some really good great

1930
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,779
clones that was in 0.607 I was living up

1931
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:23,100
in Mount Shasta area

1932
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:25,198
and my buddy from Eugene came down he

1933
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:28,020
brought from Roseburg to Oregon he

1934
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:31,559
brought medwoman he brought shishka

1935
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:34,140
Berry he brought a grapefruit cut that

1936
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,239
is unlike any grapefruit I've ever seen

1937
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:38,159
again it was [ __ ] amazing it's one of

1938
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,779
the it's one of the few ones I wish I

1939
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:43,679
had because usually I just don't care

1940
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:46,679
I'm just one popular but that grapefruit

1941
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:48,480
was [ __ ] insane

1942
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:50,579
um cheese

1943
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,399
he got he brought down some really great

1944
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:56,219
stuff I threw

1945
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:58,259
I threw my this this whole this thing

1946
01:20:56,219 --> 01:21:00,539
and my friend and I made the Bilo I

1947
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,900
threw that on everything because that's

1948
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:06,899
what we had I had moved back down here

1949
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:08,279
and we brought these beat up moms down

1950
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:12,179
here

1951
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:15,238
and nobody really had the capacity to

1952
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:17,100
like take cuts and keep stuff or or we

1953
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:18,839
weren't interested at that time it was

1954
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:21,120
kind of a transitional time in my life

1955
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,500
and so we just threw what pollen we had

1956
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:24,840
on it

1957
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:27,960
I still have a whole shitload of those

1958
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,340
somewhere in the freezer seats yeah of

1959
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,500
the grapefruit

1960
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:34,619
the grapefruit's The One That Got Away

1961
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,960
the the last batch of those seeds I gave

1962
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:40,140
to a buddy to grow out the year we had

1963
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,359
our fire they burnt there's no more

1964
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:45,000
grapefruit hybrids no

1965
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:47,399
I know and I and we've tried to find

1966
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,340
that that cutting and organ several

1967
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:52,738
times

1968
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:58,380
very hard with such a generic name yeah

1969
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:58,379
I tried to grow out Relic grapefruit

1970
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,360
um to see it because he was in the

1971
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,739
similar area and he had a lot he had a

1972
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,039
lot of the same things he worked with

1973
01:22:04,738 --> 01:22:09,779
berry cheese

1974
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:13,260
grapefruitment man he probably had the

1975
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:16,559
same ones I did I grew those out there

1976
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:19,020
was no crazy grapefruit there was old

1977
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,000
school smells in it it was cool but it

1978
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:24,300
was a different kind of grapefruit

1979
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,579
probably yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah

1980
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,779
I mean people call different c99s

1981
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:31,140
grapefruit we have a sweet pink

1982
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:31,859
grapefruit we have grapefruit Romulan I

1983
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,980
mean there's so many different

1984
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:36,479
grapefruits yeah that's a bad grapefruit

1985
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:39,178
I mean the good thing about it is is

1986
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:40,799
that it's like I was talking about it uh

1987
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:43,619
the other it's kind of funny when people

1988
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,719
find some kind of terp or combination

1989
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:48,479
and then start to claim that like

1990
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:50,460
anything that does that comes from them

1991
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:51,959
right like you like if there's

1992
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,420
grapefruit there's going to be

1993
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,579
grapefruit again just because we lost

1994
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:59,640
the terp combination of certain ones

1995
01:22:56,579 --> 01:23:01,859
it's common enough that it popped up in

1996
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,900
enough different things that I'm

1997
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:05,639
confident it'll exist again in some

1998
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:08,399
format well you know it's kind of like

1999
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,679
the blueberry story right like I mean

2000
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,960
one person claims all smells of

2001
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:15,119
blueberry and cannabis is all his

2002
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,520
descendants you know but we know that

2003
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,279
like I've seen blueberry pop out of

2004
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:22,199
Irene Sour Diesel you know like super

2005
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:23,460
blueberry chirps it's possible to find

2006
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:25,439
in all kinds of different combinations

2007
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:28,198
and we'll always run into it again yeah

2008
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:31,379
you never no I mean especially if your

2009
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:34,139
seeds have a good deep pool in them you

2010
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:36,659
know you could get all kinds of [ __ ] I

2011
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:41,039
mean when I grew out the maple

2012
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:43,619
uh Mendo perps I probably popped I don't

2013
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:45,539
know two three hundred of them or at

2014
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:48,719
least 200 of them or you know to be

2015
01:23:45,539 --> 01:23:51,479
conservative yeah range is [ __ ]

2016
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:53,939
amazing you get such and that's fun to

2017
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:57,059
me at this point instead of trying to

2018
01:23:53,939 --> 01:23:59,399
make something consistent I almost would

2019
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:01,320
rather make something wild at this time

2020
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:05,519
that you can actually get something

2021
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:07,139
unique out of you know yeah I mean Caleb

2022
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,540
makes a really good point dude where he

2023
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:10,920
talks about like he used the Mendo perps

2024
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:13,800
as an example because it has a really

2025
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,020
wide genetic he was like if I gave a

2026
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,880
hundred s1s to like seven or eight

2027
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:20,219
different friends and ask them to select

2028
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,960
what they like and breed with it yeah it

2029
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:24,239
would probably end up with wildly

2030
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:26,760
different selections yeah and people

2031
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:29,218
would take it in their own way and it

2032
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,780
wouldn't be similar at all yeah and I

2033
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:33,658
think the maples kind of like that the

2034
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:35,399
maple the maple from Scentsy is probably

2035
01:24:33,658 --> 01:24:37,319
it's probably like two or three

2036
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,119
different of Neville's Maple cuts and a

2037
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:41,399
little skunk one and it's probably

2038
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:43,500
pretty wide you know yeah and then the

2039
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:46,319
mendo's wide so you cross that and you

2040
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:48,300
just get like a whole host of it isn't

2041
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:49,799
really is what it is it can be a lot of

2042
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:52,500
different things the maple was

2043
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:55,440
dominantly I like I told Matt the other

2044
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:58,380
night it it had long inner nodes it had

2045
01:24:55,439 --> 01:25:00,299
fluffy kind of terpenolene based stuff

2046
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:01,859
somewhere resinous some looked pretty

2047
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,320
ropey Dopey

2048
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:07,139
but everybody liked it as far as just

2049
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:09,599
smoking a joint you know it was good

2050
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,460
but every once in a while I'd say the

2051
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,140
rare thing in that line was to get

2052
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:16,380
something that actually had a little

2053
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:20,340
density to it and a resinous appearance

2054
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:22,079
to it in more of a like a fat leaf that

2055
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:24,239
wasn't the common thing but it was in

2056
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:27,420
there yeah you know I had that same

2057
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:28,859
experience with black domino the exact

2058
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,840
same experience it was one that I

2059
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:34,079
expected to find some faster finishing

2060
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,360
almost blackish purple like uh really

2061
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:38,698
resinous cushy looking things and what I

2062
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:42,000
got was exactly what you described which

2063
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:45,299
were like 13 14 week Airy fluffy

2064
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,439
terpineline not a lot of stuff that one

2065
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,179
actually didn't have a lot of variants

2066
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:50,819
that from what I saw it was just all

2067
01:25:48,179 --> 01:25:52,560
tended to be that yeah but I'm sure

2068
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:55,859
there was other stuff in it just in the

2069
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:58,560
pack that I popped that yeah like 30 or

2070
01:25:55,859 --> 01:26:00,238
exactly I bought 10 you know it's like

2071
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,380
what are you gonna fight I remember

2072
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:07,079
people ordering Scentsy Afghani Ones

2073
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:10,079
based on the picture oh yeah at least

2074
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:13,920
fun stuff they are all just super tall

2075
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:16,439
super leggy they weren't they were they

2076
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:19,920
did not get fat leaves

2077
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:23,219
buff structured [ __ ] out of that you

2078
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:25,079
know yeah there's a lot of really poofy

2079
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:27,300
ugly Afghani number one I've only seen

2080
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:30,300
like a few really Prime Cuts ever

2081
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:34,139
selected from that line I will say that

2082
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:36,300
you know uh a lot of the Afghan that

2083
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:38,460
first came over to Mendo and Humboldt

2084
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:40,079
and stuff a lot of the Old Timers I

2085
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:43,679
think that's a consistent thing with

2086
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:46,380
Afghani in the sense that like there's a

2087
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:49,500
lot of kind of boofy Afghan I mean

2088
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:51,719
everything ran that G13 nl2 from Neville

2089
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:54,560
some of the last original seeds he had

2090
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:57,840
and it is exactly as as well

2091
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,520
as he's describing it it was terminoline

2092
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,579
loose

2093
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,080
yeah he wasn't stoked yeah no but

2094
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:06,059
there's I mean there's an aspect where

2095
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:08,939
then you you find afino that you want

2096
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:10,080
and breed with that and there are you

2097
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:11,939
know it's like that's kind of like

2098
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:13,679
everybody wants land race but nobody

2099
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:15,178
wants diversity because that means it's

2100
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:17,340
like they don't want to like pop a few

2101
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:19,920
packs and it all sucks yeah I get

2102
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:22,860
excited about ugly plants at this point

2103
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:25,199
like to me that's fun and some of those

2104
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:28,259
really ugly things smoked really nice

2105
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:30,779
and some of this really dense crazy

2106
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,179
stuff to me that's not like the most I

2107
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:35,399
mean I need to get you some of that Rose

2108
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:37,380
flow I grew I know I gave the rest to

2109
01:27:35,399 --> 01:27:38,399
cry baby of it pure but it is some of

2110
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:40,079
the

2111
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:43,979
ugliest [ __ ] [ __ ] I've ever seen in

2112
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:46,319
my life it burns up with any nutrients

2113
01:27:43,979 --> 01:27:48,059
but it's bright red pretty leaves like

2114
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,099
there's so much pretty about it and it

2115
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:53,580
and for flows there's like no density to

2116
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:56,340
it but it breeds great yeah but

2117
01:27:53,579 --> 01:27:58,679
ugly as [ __ ] not much resin yeah it's

2118
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:00,779
it's one of those that you it's very

2119
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:04,460
unique High

2120
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:06,960
yeah yeah I know I mean

2121
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:10,139
you know we didn't need to really be

2122
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:13,260
visually that appealing until Instagram

2123
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:15,960
I view the Instagram era as like a

2124
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:17,760
massive change in what lead had to look

2125
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,260
like there was lots of weed that was

2126
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,780
somewhat ugly

2127
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:23,880
but if it worked and smoked and tasted

2128
01:28:21,779 --> 01:28:26,279
really nice and got you Zippy high like

2129
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:29,400
you were stoked like he was talking

2130
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:32,099
about that sour you know that's sour it

2131
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:34,738
was it was it was stemi it was loose it

2132
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:37,380
was funky looking in some ways but it

2133
01:28:34,738 --> 01:28:40,079
got you ripped high yeah it tasted great

2134
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:43,199
tasted amazing yeah

2135
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:45,658
you know so yeah I think of it a little

2136
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:48,479
different I think the market and people

2137
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:50,879
just always especially when spending 50

2138
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:53,279
bucks was a lot to them because they

2139
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,060
didn't have much money they wanted it to

2140
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:57,119
be

2141
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:58,679
like they wanted the appearances that we

2142
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,019
used to call it fake

2143
01:28:58,679 --> 01:29:04,399
fake tits and bleach blonde hair weed

2144
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:06,020
you know they wanted dense crystally

2145
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:10,379
buds

2146
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:12,780
just to look at because blackberry kush

2147
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:16,020
I have blackberry kush I mean honestly

2148
01:29:12,779 --> 01:29:18,238
dude you know I remember I never [ __ ]

2149
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:21,179
with that clone I saw tons of it but I

2150
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:23,759
remember getting an ounce of weed in San

2151
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:25,920
Francisco in the 90s once and it was we

2152
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,840
you know we just called it Hydro you

2153
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,300
know it was some kind of indoor and

2154
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:33,659
there was only like nine butts

2155
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:36,420
and we were like so pumped you know

2156
01:29:33,658 --> 01:29:38,939
because each Bud was like two to four

2157
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:40,800
grams yeah you know what I mean it was

2158
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:43,079
like looking at like these chunky you

2159
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:46,020
were like oh God somebody gave me like

2160
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:48,059
the breeder stash yeah you know because

2161
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:49,679
you know it was one of those things

2162
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:52,020
where it was like it wasn't that common

2163
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:54,179
to see so you wanted visually appealing

2164
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:56,100
I don't remember anything about that

2165
01:29:54,179 --> 01:29:58,920
weed except for how impressed we were

2166
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:00,659
that it was nice butts yeah it looked

2167
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,760
nice and big yeah it was just blue it

2168
01:30:00,658 --> 01:30:05,339
was just bright green and bright orange

2169
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,480
hairs and Frosty and all these big

2170
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:09,239
chunks

2171
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:12,539
a lot of times people and they got an

2172
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:14,819
eight that just had one Chunk in it they

2173
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:16,920
were kind of butt hurt you know like

2174
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:20,279
they they or they questioned if you were

2175
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:21,679
giving them 2.8 instead of 3.5 of course

2176
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:25,800
yeah

2177
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:27,840
but it but if it was good if it if it

2178
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,340
was strong they've just didn't forget

2179
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,279
you know

2180
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,539
they they'd want more

2181
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:36,179
and yeah

2182
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:40,859
let's see someone asked what were the

2183
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:44,639
earliest purple strained Ring song Cali

2184
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:47,099
I'd say the earliest well the the real

2185
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:49,440
the earliest ones were just overripe

2186
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:52,860
depleted plants that maybe turned purple

2187
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:54,899
and they weren't we we thought oh

2188
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:57,359
somebody said they had purple he'd be

2189
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:59,519
like oh it's garbage you know because it

2190
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:01,319
was always like something left on the

2191
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:04,460
vine depleted

2192
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:08,219
whatever it wasn't really good but

2193
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:13,619
Laytonville Laytonville had uh in fact

2194
01:31:08,219 --> 01:31:17,219
that ties back to the underwear guy

2195
01:31:13,619 --> 01:31:18,059
um lived in the shack

2196
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:21,359
um

2197
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:23,520
they there was a a real common type in

2198
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:25,859
Laytonville and this I kind of sometimes

2199
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,420
I think of this with the Mendo perp

2200
01:31:25,859 --> 01:31:29,299
story it's kind of my own take or

2201
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:33,899
whatever but

2202
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:35,579
there there was a green and a purple and

2203
01:31:33,899 --> 01:31:37,679
they were both really pretty you could

2204
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:40,859
tell the purple was supposed to be there

2205
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:43,500
instead of something that was you know a

2206
01:31:40,859 --> 01:31:45,238
reflection of some something not good

2207
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:48,119
you know was that the strain that people

2208
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:51,718
called the purple from Laytonville

2209
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:54,000
maybe okay maybe that's the second time

2210
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:55,679
I've heard uh the Laytonville purple

2211
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,719
like a specific Laytonville purple

2212
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:00,719
mentioned in relation to like one of the

2213
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:04,260
early purple yeah I've seen a bunch of

2214
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:07,560
families that I'd met back then had the

2215
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:10,260
similar stuff and it'd be like they'd

2216
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:13,320
have either this bright green it was

2217
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:15,420
never real dense it was just nice yeah

2218
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:17,519
and then there was like a purple side

2219
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:21,960
that was really pretty

2220
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:24,960
that would be in there too yeah and so

2221
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,760
and it all it often had a real sweet

2222
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:30,480
like Fruity

2223
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:32,159
type of smell to it also interesting and

2224
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:34,198
there's an aspect too that people should

2225
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,719
know that what what Rings is talking

2226
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:39,419
about when like overdone [ __ ] is

2227
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:41,639
freaking uh uh uh

2228
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:44,460
um people would do first and second and

2229
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:46,260
third Cuts oh and so a lot of times

2230
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:48,420
there would be purple weed that would be

2231
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:50,760
like all the smalls that everybody left

2232
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:53,639
to ripen and they'd stick out in the

2233
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:56,400
cold and they'd turn dark and it was

2234
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:58,800
like all the under light under fed stuff

2235
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:01,319
that would happen and then they would

2236
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:04,079
cut that and put it into pounds so it

2237
01:33:01,319 --> 01:33:08,698
was the same price as the tops back then

2238
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:10,920
you know it just sucked but but it was

2239
01:33:08,698 --> 01:33:13,859
still yeah people would really milk

2240
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:16,380
their [ __ ] and I didn't see not too many

2241
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:19,259
people cleaned up their plants to try to

2242
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:22,560
make their tops the best

2243
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:25,079
you know they would just pick those tops

2244
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,000
let those other things go until they did

2245
01:33:25,079 --> 01:33:29,579
something and some streams really

2246
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,859
actually did okay with it and some of

2247
01:33:29,579 --> 01:33:33,300
them would just [ __ ] out as soon as you

2248
01:33:31,859 --> 01:33:35,639
picked on them they would everything

2249
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:38,159
else would be shitty but they would

2250
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:40,199
still pick it and sell it there was this

2251
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:42,059
aspect where people thought oh we can

2252
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:43,799
leave this stuff on and let it ripen

2253
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:46,139
because it's underdone it never got

2254
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,639
enough light we'll just leave it out and

2255
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:50,219
it's not gonna rot because it's too

2256
01:33:47,639 --> 01:33:52,079
small yeah and then that stuff would

2257
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:54,420
ripen and turn colors because it would

2258
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:56,100
get pretty cold at night you know and

2259
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:59,239
then they would go out and harvest it so

2260
01:33:56,100 --> 01:34:03,719
it was often like late batch under

2261
01:33:59,238 --> 01:34:06,000
underground you know like remnants yeah

2262
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:07,198
for the most part

2263
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,520
um

2264
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,339
yeah

2265
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:13,920
yeah no it's fun I mean that that I mean

2266
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:17,279
being a hobbyist and moving out here and

2267
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:20,520
just seeing all that [ __ ] it was just my

2268
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:22,679
mind I was just the happiest boy in my

2269
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,960
20s running around these Hills looking

2270
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:27,060
at as much [ __ ] as I could I thought it

2271
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:29,340
was great

2272
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:33,060
I can only imagine yeah

2273
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:35,279
and being being that age and and like I

2274
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:36,480
obviously I lift my era because that

2275
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:37,859
would have been something I would have

2276
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:39,059
loved to have lived through so it's

2277
01:34:37,859 --> 01:34:40,799
pretty cool to be able to pick your

2278
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:42,719
brain yeah and to be able to sit here

2279
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,060
and ask you questions about it and kind

2280
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,158
of uh live via proxy through an error

2281
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:49,739
that I missed yeah I mean we're all born

2282
01:34:47,158 --> 01:34:51,359
when we're born we all get our turn I

2283
01:34:49,738 --> 01:34:53,539
know you still got to see cool or punk

2284
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:57,179
rock [ __ ] than I did too

2285
01:34:53,539 --> 01:34:59,039
[ __ ] yeah and you know what I

2286
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:01,920
mean growing up in the town that I did

2287
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:03,359
there was it was almost Unthinkable that

2288
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,980
it could have happened it was just my

2289
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:07,439
older brother and their friends I don't

2290
01:35:04,979 --> 01:35:10,738
know how they stumbled on

2291
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:13,379
that's how I got sucked in too is was

2292
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:15,599
who became my older brother-in-law yeah

2293
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:18,000
me and punk rocks even a little kid so

2294
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:21,060
yeah makes sense yeah

2295
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,158
yeah that was fun too and still was for

2296
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:25,320
all those years too moving out here and

2297
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:27,359
being able to run down to the city down

2298
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:29,819
to San Francisco and

2299
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:33,119
sometimes I'd see bands I knew from the

2300
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:36,238
Midwest played in San Francisco that was

2301
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:38,158
always fun too just little reunions in

2302
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,678
the street

2303
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:42,539
yeah is there anything else you wanted

2304
01:35:40,679 --> 01:35:44,279
to cover not so one of the things that

2305
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:46,979
we could cover that kind of ties into

2306
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:50,039
what we were talking about is that both

2307
01:35:46,979 --> 01:35:51,718
rings and I arrived in Mendo when it was

2308
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:55,800
I mentioned it before but when it was

2309
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:59,579
kind of poor and weird right and uh it

2310
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:01,920
was very odd place and you know and then

2311
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:04,679
you know people think too like people

2312
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:07,199
used to come to Mendo all the time and

2313
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:09,060
be like oh my God wheat is legal

2314
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,219
and we did this thing where we passed

2315
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:13,260
this thing measure G which kind of

2316
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:15,000
basically forbade the cops from messing

2317
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:17,639
with you too hard if you only had 25

2318
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,380
plants and you had your paperwork and so

2319
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:21,840
people would come to Mendo every week

2320
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:23,219
and be like wheat is legal I can do

2321
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,619
whatever I want

2322
01:36:23,219 --> 01:36:27,420
and you would be like oh my God no like

2323
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:29,219
there's very much a cat and mouse game

2324
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:31,619
that goes on between you and your

2325
01:36:29,219 --> 01:36:33,300
neighbors and where you're at what part

2326
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:36,179
of the county there was neighborhoods

2327
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:37,560
that you could get away with it fine and

2328
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:39,779
there was neighborhoods where like

2329
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:42,320
retired doctors or lawyers or whoever

2330
01:36:39,779 --> 01:36:45,719
would just report anything that they saw

2331
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:47,759
absolutely and if you didn't know like

2332
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:50,039
which streets and which areas were

2333
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,800
kosher and not you could come up here

2334
01:36:50,039 --> 01:36:57,060
and like way get like like in the wrong

2335
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:58,679
spot and get the most amazing things was

2336
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:02,719
that you could go to the sheriff's

2337
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:05,760
department and buy 25 zip ties for

2338
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:08,819
625 boxers you could yellow big yellow

2339
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,139
zip ties I mean my my ex had cancer well

2340
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:12,899
you're in the sheriff's department

2341
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:14,159
getting these zip ties from some old

2342
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:16,500
lady

2343
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:18,539
and you'd go and wrap them around your

2344
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:20,219
stock and you just felt like [ __ ] the

2345
01:37:18,539 --> 01:37:22,679
neighbors whatever they can [ __ ] all

2346
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:25,679
they want if you got these things the

2347
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:29,158
cops and you have only 25 like you were

2348
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:32,880
you felt pretty empowered so that

2349
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:34,439
created probably I would say in

2350
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,199
I don't know I've been here four or five

2351
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:38,879
years or longer then so it was probably

2352
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:41,698
0203 maybe it was when it really started

2353
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:44,639
what we call like the Green Wave so

2354
01:37:41,698 --> 01:37:46,919
probably like 0203 to maybe like 09

2355
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:49,319
there was just an immense wave of

2356
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:52,199
Outsiders that came into the county all

2357
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:54,479
at once buying up property they drove up

2358
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:55,819
the cost of properties by enormous

2359
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:59,759
amounts

2360
01:37:55,819 --> 01:38:01,380
people really started blowing it up huge

2361
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,760
um it changed the culture of the place

2362
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:05,100
because anytime you get a bunch of

2363
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:07,260
Outsiders coming in too fast they can't

2364
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:09,620
learn from the people that were already

2365
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:12,239
there and so there was like friction

2366
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:13,800
between the people that had been here

2367
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:15,779
for a while and the people that were

2368
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,159
just sort of like there was people that

2369
01:38:15,779 --> 01:38:19,979
were like

2370
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:22,019
I moved here I bought this land it's in

2371
01:38:19,979 --> 01:38:24,238
the country which means I'm American and

2372
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,760
I can like fire guns and get drunk and

2373
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:29,039
drive 70 miles an hour up the thing and

2374
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,320
I can drain the community spring and I

2375
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:34,079
don't give a [ __ ] I'm growing weed and

2376
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:36,359
[ __ ] my neighbors and suck a dick and

2377
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:37,859
you'd be like oh no no no no that

2378
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:39,839
doesn't actually work well you know

2379
01:38:37,859 --> 01:38:44,179
people yeah you'll end up in a whole

2380
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,179
[ __ ] this is Mendo

2381
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:49,339
clones too that was the beginning of

2382
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:53,939
like the seeds

2383
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:56,940
the seed the past was just disappeared

2384
01:38:53,939 --> 01:38:59,399
into clones at that time too and I I

2385
01:38:56,939 --> 01:39:01,439
remember being really bummed because I

2386
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:05,339
knew I could see it happening I was like

2387
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:08,519
all this diversity is just going away to

2388
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:12,480
Barry White half goo

2389
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:14,820
and blue dream clones like all these

2390
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:17,638
people all these people would have grown

2391
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:19,920
25 plants from seed

2392
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:24,000
any time before this but now they're

2393
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:25,619
just mono cropping one one thing

2394
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,698
and they you know they would come here

2395
01:39:25,619 --> 01:39:28,319
and they would want to make a bunch of

2396
01:39:26,698 --> 01:39:30,779
money a lot of them wouldn't even stay

2397
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:33,479
here over the winter you know they would

2398
01:39:30,779 --> 01:39:34,738
come seasonally to make money in bail

2399
01:39:33,479 --> 01:39:36,539
um and it changed the culture of the

2400
01:39:34,738 --> 01:39:39,000
place it brought a lot of money and it

2401
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:41,880
definitely improved thousands upon

2402
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:45,539
thousands of of rural properties that

2403
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:48,779
got built up and made nice and Ukiah the

2404
01:39:45,539 --> 01:39:52,139
hot main Hub I mean it it put a switch

2405
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:54,840
it polished the turd if you will oh I

2406
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:57,359
mean when I first moved Willets uh which

2407
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:00,139
is the town north of us and you in uh uh

2408
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:03,899
in Mendo was half of it was boarded up

2409
01:40:00,139 --> 01:40:06,000
it had some really hideous buildings it

2410
01:40:03,899 --> 01:40:07,679
was it was way on the downturn and now

2411
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,560
what's funny the reason why I brought it

2412
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,239
up is because we we've been talking a

2413
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,039
bunch about how we watched all these

2414
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:16,319
people flow in

2415
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:18,359
and now with the collapse of the wheat

2416
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:20,039
economy and the prices dropping to so

2417
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:22,679
crazy and everybody getting used to

2418
01:40:20,039 --> 01:40:24,600
Growing volume which Rings hates and

2419
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:26,579
growing a bunch of B and C Grade weed

2420
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,500
and just hoping it was good enough now

2421
01:40:26,579 --> 01:40:30,600
all these people are flowing back out of

2422
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:32,939
the community because everyone that came

2423
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,199
in for easy money is like oh it's not

2424
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:36,919
easy

2425
01:40:34,198 --> 01:40:39,539
Oklahoma bye-bye

2426
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:42,539
yeah they were there was a lot of rich

2427
01:40:39,539 --> 01:40:44,519
kids a lot of you know because I mean

2428
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:48,238
you had to have some it was either like

2429
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:50,520
big Hustlers from from cities all over

2430
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:53,579
the country are rich kids because you

2431
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:56,400
had it still cost a lot of money to get

2432
01:40:53,579 --> 01:40:59,100
a property and actually set it up

2433
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:00,000
and pay people and stuff like that you

2434
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:04,440
had to

2435
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:06,600
you know they had to you you couldn't be

2436
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:09,658
broke and come to Mendo and start a

2437
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:12,060
scene no you know they there's a lot of

2438
01:41:09,658 --> 01:41:13,859
people up here that didn't want to admit

2439
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:15,500
that they got their parents to buy them

2440
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:17,939
properties

2441
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:19,439
and then they started blowing and then

2442
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:22,259
they started blowing it up and like

2443
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,399
going on vacations and I used to think a

2444
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,600
lot of those people I was like man

2445
01:41:23,399 --> 01:41:26,579
they're just so much better at what

2446
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:28,860
they're doing than I am and then I

2447
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:30,719
realized that like their parents bought

2448
01:41:28,859 --> 01:41:32,819
them like it was just play money to them

2449
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:35,100
well I was trying to like live and

2450
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:37,019
survive and breed and do these different

2451
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:39,600
things and like there was no backstop

2452
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:41,820
like they had the parent that like put

2453
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:44,280
them put the property in their name they

2454
01:41:41,819 --> 01:41:46,198
put the day payment down safety nets

2455
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:47,759
would be [ __ ] awesome and you didn't

2456
01:41:46,198 --> 01:41:49,819
realize that none of them none of them

2457
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:52,500
really wanted to tell you

2458
01:41:49,819 --> 01:41:54,899
right now we're going back to work for

2459
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:58,380
their mom and dad's corporations after

2460
01:41:54,899 --> 01:42:00,179
15 years yeah they are bendo yeah of

2461
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:02,460
blowing it up in Mendo and a lot of them

2462
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:05,880
too to be honest they would come up here

2463
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:07,980
for two or three years and actually grow

2464
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,779
and then they would Farm it out to a

2465
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:11,638
good friend or friends that weren't

2466
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:13,859
doing as well and still take a huge

2467
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:16,079
percentage but it was their property

2468
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:18,299
yeah and they would live in Santa Rosa

2469
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:19,679
or the bay or Southern California or

2470
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:22,440
whatever and they would come up at

2471
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:24,359
important times to their property and

2472
01:42:22,439 --> 01:42:26,519
make sure it worked yeah but they

2473
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:28,019
weren't really from here yeah they just

2474
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,520
kind of came up and blew it up and made

2475
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,260
some money and then left and then used

2476
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,639
the funnel to like funnel money to

2477
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:35,639
themselves so they could live where they

2478
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:38,100
wanted yeah we know lots of those yeah

2479
01:42:35,639 --> 01:42:40,980
and so it's kind of getting back to like

2480
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:43,320
broken weird again in a way yeah which

2481
01:42:40,979 --> 01:42:45,299
is painful to see but

2482
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:49,679
you know it's not like it's not like

2483
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:54,560
Ukiah will turn back into uh poor town

2484
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:57,480
with a big factories on the edge of town

2485
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,760
you know exhaust over the whole town

2486
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:01,079
it's it won't be back there because now

2487
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,780
it's just

2488
01:43:01,079 --> 01:43:06,439
it's like the new affordable place for

2489
01:43:03,779 --> 01:43:09,539
City people to put their money because

2490
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:13,678
all the towns between here and San

2491
01:43:09,539 --> 01:43:17,100
Francisco are ludicrously expensive you

2492
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:19,020
know like every time a person sells a

2493
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:21,119
house in town There's a person from the

2494
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:24,060
Bay Area willing to just buy it because

2495
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:27,238
it's only six hundred thousand whereas

2496
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:29,760
anywhere south of here it's 800 or a

2497
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:31,259
million for the same and so there's an

2498
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,260
aspect where if you live in like The

2499
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:36,360
Valleys where where uh yeah where we

2500
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:38,219
live right now he's making fun of me

2501
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:40,198
because I got this verbal tick I got rid

2502
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:42,179
of one and then others came in my place

2503
01:43:40,198 --> 01:43:44,339
but

2504
01:43:42,179 --> 01:43:45,960
um there's part where around Ukiah

2505
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:48,420
around Redwood Valley around certain

2506
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:51,060
valleys the I think the properties are

2507
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:53,460
maintaining value but there's a lot of

2508
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:55,280
like mountainous properties that when

2509
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:57,359
people tried to get them permitted

2510
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:59,519
they're just not permittable that

2511
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:01,859
without hundreds of thousands of dollars

2512
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:04,679
of improvements most of them don't even

2513
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:07,859
have enough water on them to grow a

2514
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:12,239
garden I mean if people came up here and

2515
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:14,639
spent 350 000 buying a raw 20 acres that

2516
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:16,138
had no water on it and they set it up

2517
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,719
and buy water

2518
01:44:16,139 --> 01:44:20,819
and have it delivered

2519
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:23,340
and now that the weed isn't bringing

2520
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:27,479
money what is that property worth really

2521
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:28,860
you know exactly sure and so there's a

2522
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:31,799
lot of things too and this is another

2523
01:44:28,859 --> 01:44:33,960
kind of conflict in our area where the

2524
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:36,119
regulations want people to come out of

2525
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:38,340
the traditional pot growing areas in the

2526
01:44:36,118 --> 01:44:40,618
hills and they want them to come down to

2527
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:42,119
the valleys and like get legal on like

2528
01:44:40,618 --> 01:44:43,979
AG land

2529
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:46,738
and then there's a bunch of retired

2530
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:48,118
doctors and lawyers and wine people that

2531
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:50,218
are like what do you mean there's a grow

2532
01:44:48,118 --> 01:44:52,198
down the street

2533
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:53,880
I don't want to see that that's supposed

2534
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:55,559
to hide up in the hills I bought this

2535
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:59,279
retirement property it's all supposed to

2536
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:01,020
be rolling grapes and Orchards and not

2537
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,059
these degenerates with me I don't care

2538
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:06,239
do they have a permit well

2539
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:08,219
um Sonoma County had a big problem you

2540
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:12,238
know at first when they were starting to

2541
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:15,840
go legal and I mean who owns Sonoma

2542
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:18,718
County Rich conservative wine Growers

2543
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:21,119
they were not into it and then some of

2544
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,880
those people were actually investing in

2545
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:26,219
weed once it really got legal oh yeah

2546
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,199
you know but they hated it before and

2547
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:29,340
and they probably still ate it but

2548
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:31,559
they're going to invest in it now to

2549
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:33,480
make some money money is money yeah

2550
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,880
but there's a there's an aspect where

2551
01:45:33,479 --> 01:45:38,099
you see a lot my my point to that I

2552
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,539
guess was that I'm curious in two or

2553
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:41,760
three years what a lot of these Mountain

2554
01:45:39,539 --> 01:45:44,760
properties look like because the price

2555
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:46,199
of wheat has collapsed so much and it

2556
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:48,840
might cost hundreds of thousands of

2557
01:45:46,198 --> 01:45:50,698
dollars just to fix your road so that

2558
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:52,800
like you know the fire department and

2559
01:45:50,698 --> 01:45:56,759
whoever else will sign off on you having

2560
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:58,980
a a one license growth and if it's if

2561
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:01,980
the angle of your road is more than 14

2562
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:03,959
degrees you have to get it paved or this

2563
01:46:01,979 --> 01:46:05,638
or this or this and so a lot of these

2564
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:08,158
places where it used to be traditional

2565
01:46:05,639 --> 01:46:10,199
and good to hide and grow Mountain weed

2566
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:13,198
and it's clean and it's pure up there

2567
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:16,618
it's not suitable for the current form

2568
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:19,259
of legal yeah unless you get lucky very

2569
01:46:16,618 --> 01:46:22,019
few of them had enough water they barely

2570
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:24,900
had enough water to just

2571
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:27,540
Supply a normal household

2572
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:29,879
you know let alone a big Garden out in

2573
01:46:27,539 --> 01:46:31,920
the out on the left you know so they

2574
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:33,659
were all trucking it in foot people in

2575
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,179
the last few years were spending trying

2576
01:46:33,658 --> 01:46:37,439
to grow these 10 000 Square foots off of

2577
01:46:36,179 --> 01:46:40,980
bottom water

2578
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:43,198
they were spending like 1200 bucks a day

2579
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:44,939
or more I've heard about that people

2580
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:46,799
Trucking in water and people Trucking in

2581
01:46:44,939 --> 01:46:48,899
water water trucks running around

2582
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,699
everywhere they're tanking I talked to a

2583
01:46:48,899 --> 01:46:53,158
water truck driver that I knew the other

2584
01:46:50,698 --> 01:46:55,738
day he's like ma'am

2585
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:58,859
there ain't [ __ ] going on he's like I

2586
01:46:55,738 --> 01:47:01,019
didn't make [ __ ] last year from it you

2587
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:03,719
know it's just over there tons of people

2588
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:05,760
bought water trucks it was all the rage

2589
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:07,260
yeah I mean there was enough profit in

2590
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,719
it that it made sense to do a lot of

2591
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:11,579
things like that you know and so I used

2592
01:47:09,719 --> 01:47:13,020
to I used to have this running joke that

2593
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:17,039
like it'd be you'd find something and

2594
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:19,920
it'd be like a a composting toilet you

2595
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:22,738
know cute little Shack you know solar

2596
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,500
power 20 acres and it'd be like 700

2597
01:47:22,738 --> 01:47:27,059
Grand because people would be like oh

2598
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:29,399
you could put 50 plants on that thing

2599
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:31,800
and make tons of money pay it off in a

2600
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:33,179
couple of years and so now what is that

2601
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,079
property going to be worth in a couple

2602
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:36,300
years

2603
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:37,979
like the you know what what really is

2604
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:39,659
that is that weird it doesn't have a

2605
01:47:37,979 --> 01:47:42,178
septic it doesn't have a this it doesn't

2606
01:47:39,658 --> 01:47:44,759
have a that it's just a spot how many of

2607
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:48,779
these people have moved here just had no

2608
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:51,000
idea how to like maintain a property you

2609
01:47:48,779 --> 01:47:53,039
know like these properties are just [ __ ]

2610
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,880
they're leaving them with just broken

2611
01:47:53,039 --> 01:48:00,000
down carports and

2612
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:03,500
shitty Shacks they threw up real quick

2613
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:07,618
just to dry some plants and I mean just

2614
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:10,560
garbage tons of garbage you know on them

2615
01:48:07,618 --> 01:48:12,420
they're they're crap yeah there's a lot

2616
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:14,280
people leave a lot of garbage everyone

2617
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:16,980
thinks that like Mendo and Humboldt is

2618
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:18,979
this beautiful pristine place there's a

2619
01:48:16,979 --> 01:48:21,539
lot of human garbage

2620
01:48:18,979 --> 01:48:23,539
my friends from Santa Cruz would come up

2621
01:48:21,539 --> 01:48:26,460
here and go man

2622
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:30,198
why does everybody like having garbage

2623
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:30,198
out in their front yards up here

2624
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:37,860
a natural repository for garbage yards

2625
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:42,500
too yeah Endo fashion is having some

2626
01:48:37,859 --> 01:48:46,380
sort of blue tarp ripped up and you know

2627
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:48,238
yeah it's normal around here

2628
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:50,219
I mean there was places that we bought

2629
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:52,379
that we went in and like they would take

2630
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:54,539
like an old barn or an abandoned cabin

2631
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:56,159
and they would just fill it with their

2632
01:48:54,539 --> 01:48:57,479
household trash because they didn't want

2633
01:48:56,158 --> 01:48:59,460
to have trash service

2634
01:48:57,479 --> 01:49:01,738
yeah yeah and you'd have to put on like

2635
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:03,960
essentially a hazmat suit and you'd rent

2636
01:49:01,738 --> 01:49:06,238
most places we got a hold of in the late

2637
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:08,219
90s through the mid-2000s

2638
01:49:06,238 --> 01:49:10,859
one of the first things you would do was

2639
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:13,859
get however many 40 yard dumpsters you

2640
01:49:10,859 --> 01:49:17,099
needed yeah yeah and you could just load

2641
01:49:13,859 --> 01:49:19,198
40 yard dumpsters with trash and some

2642
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:21,480
people would just make a huge pile and

2643
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:24,979
cover it with gas and set it on fire

2644
01:49:21,479 --> 01:49:26,599
that'd be a big black [ __ ] black

2645
01:49:24,979 --> 01:49:30,959
terrific

2646
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:33,239
oh God yeah people would you know it was

2647
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:35,060
uh it's an interesting spot but one

2648
01:49:33,238 --> 01:49:37,859
thing that one million Whip It

2649
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:40,139
containers and all that kind of [ __ ]

2650
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:42,899
later I mean in the Whip-It containers

2651
01:49:40,139 --> 01:49:45,420
in the in the open blast era of butane

2652
01:49:42,899 --> 01:49:47,158
it got really bad up here and people

2653
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:49,500
would do stuff where they got scared of

2654
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:52,019
throwing away thousands of empty cans of

2655
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:53,579
Tain so they would like use a backhoe

2656
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:55,500
and dig a hole in the woods and just

2657
01:49:53,579 --> 01:49:58,079
pour all the thing in there and drive

2658
01:49:55,500 --> 01:50:00,539
over it and then fill it back in

2659
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:04,139
that was I mean

2660
01:50:00,539 --> 01:50:06,840
I've seen a lot of them just left on the

2661
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:09,420
side of the road huge piles thousands

2662
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:11,460
and thousands of butane canisters just

2663
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:15,658
left out in the beautiful Wilderness

2664
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:18,658
with just a big massive pile of butane

2665
01:50:15,658 --> 01:50:20,219
cans you know I mean so there's an

2666
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:23,339
aspect to that where like that whole

2667
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:25,079
open blast era uh which was probably

2668
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:28,500
eight or eight or ten years or something

2669
01:50:25,079 --> 01:50:30,539
like that yeah um it was a lot of damage

2670
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:33,600
you know there's a lot of dumping

2671
01:50:30,539 --> 01:50:37,198
there's a lot of those legs again on

2672
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:40,280
humans too you know some really bizarre

2673
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:43,138
stories of humans melting as the

2674
01:50:40,279 --> 01:50:45,319
clandestine butane you're laughing but

2675
01:50:43,139 --> 01:50:47,819
it's true dude it's true

2676
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:51,420
I have friends that their their skin

2677
01:50:47,819 --> 01:50:54,658
looks pebbled you know yeah it's not it

2678
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:57,118
wasn't good no anyway we're at the end

2679
01:50:54,658 --> 01:50:59,819
of the two hours oh you just ran all the

2680
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:01,920
way through it nice well you know

2681
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:05,039
