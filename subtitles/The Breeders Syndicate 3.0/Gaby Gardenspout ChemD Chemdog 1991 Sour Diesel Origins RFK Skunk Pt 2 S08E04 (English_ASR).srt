00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,359
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,099
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,059
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,419
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,140
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,699
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,439
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,280
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,280
to the underground

18
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,420
before we get started too much I got to

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,939
tell you Francis

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,800
you tend to either cut off your head or

21
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,839
your chin

22
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,659
it's like very common

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,079
you know and you do have a very like

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,000
long you know oval shaped head but still

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,780
like try to back up off the camera a

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
little bit so that don't happen

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,960
I mean every now and again you'll like

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,960
reach in and it'll be like this

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,140
awkward moments yeah what really hurts

30
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:22,500
me is that like if I put on my glasses

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,420
it's like a really awkward distance so I

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,340
can't see that well without them but

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,740
then if I put them on I have to be like

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,540
way far back and that's awkward too so

35
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:36,658
I'm sorry you know I don't I'm like all

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,360
sweaty and don't have petrified phones

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,579
and stuff like that but you know I'm a

38
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,840
cultivator not like a show personality

39
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:48,179
like exactly exactly yeah I I just left

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,240
the Garden in seconds ago compared to

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,240
compared to most shows uh Matt and I are

42
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,699
pretty Bare Bones yeah we try to make

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,640
the content speak for itself rather than

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,618
like all the fancy accoutrements that

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,019
come with it Gabby and I used to go to

46
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,978
so many concerts together and we would

47
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:10,019
often have like joints of like dog and

48
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,598
super dog and different hybrids with us

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,219
and it got to the point where like often

50
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,859
people would like that were standing

51
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,840
next to us it would smell so good they

52
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,980
would want to share it with us yeah and

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,020
him and I used to have these like

54
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,780
running debates if we should like share

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,819
or not because we had literally been at

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,919
events where like we shared a few times

57
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,619
and like people's knees would Buckle

58
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,659
because they got way too high and then

59
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,379
like security would have to come and

60
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:39,479
like help them you know and so like yeah

61
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:42,620
we got to the point where because I can

62
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,619
tell some stories like that

63
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,679
um you know like the dog was like I mean

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,439
it still is but like it was really a lot

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
stronger than what most people had

66
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,699
access to

67
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,500
yeah so we smoked it every day so we had

68
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,359
a certain tolerance to it but there was

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,280
a lot of people that like two three hits

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,280
and like they'd be in a space they were

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,860
a bit uncomfortable in oh yeah

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,300
okay I'll start by telling a story I'll

73
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,940
start by telling a

74
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,719
story when the chem dog ruins somebody's

75
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,199
day

76
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:19,199
let's hear it um so I went to a Blues

77
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,939
Traveler concert at the Greek Theater it

78
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,500
was I believe it was 1991.

79
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:28,680
uh can't be sure but it was in the early

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,139
90s and I used to see Blues Traveler

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,319
when they were just a bar band in New

82
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:36,539
York City you know playing like small

83
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,818
clubs of like 50 people

84
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,919
and you know then they got big and they

85
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,439
opened for Jerry and you know we're

86
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,818
playing the Greek Theater and so I went

87
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,560
to the Greek Theater early to wait

88
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,598
online to get in to get a good spot

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,039
because you know if you're out from out

90
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:51,840
here you know the Greek Theater is

91
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,859
generally general admission which is

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
awesome

93
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,640
and so I'm you know waiting online and

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,640
I'm talking to people and I meet

95
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,579
somebody and you know I'm smoking online

96
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:05,158
which I always do and this guy you know

97
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,180
he has you know man can I try that it's

98
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,818
amazing

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,620
so he takes a hit so it takes another

100
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,378
hit

101
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,660
and he went from being this like really

102
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:21,500
excited like jovial character to like

103
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,320
just completely like

104
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,959
and not saying anything and

105
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,959
like he got so high

106
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:34,079
that when the show let in

107
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,258
like he sat down before the line went in

108
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,839
and when the show let in he didn't go in

109
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,120
oh no I'm like bro let's go they're

110
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,779
letting us in and he just sat there and

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,759
I'm like [ __ ] I'm like well I'm going

112
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:49,739
he like he waited online for hours to

113
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
get a good spot at the show

114
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,780
and then I don't know if he ever made it

115
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,299
in because that's hilarious he got so

116
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,059
high from two hits of the chem Dawn

117
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,939
then I had this other experience this

118
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,040
one was at Phil did a show

119
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:06,899
at the

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,220
not the maritime all yeah maybe it was

121
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,000
called The Maritime Hall it was called

122
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,720
the philharmonia it was a sing-along

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,819
and I brought my camera and I was taking

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,820
pictures at this show

125
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,819
and of course I'm smoking the dog

126
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:26,699
and this lady behind me asks if she can

127
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,740
hit my joint so I'm like sure let her

128
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,939
hit the joint I and I wonder at this

129
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,379
point because I had already had this

130
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,000
experience with a few people she's like

131
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,399
oh no I smoke every day you know I'm

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,978
good so

133
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,839
she takes a couple of hits off the joint

134
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:41,879
I'm not paying attention she was behind

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,859
me right

136
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,500
and I've been taking pictures and I got

137
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,000
this like film camera around my neck you

138
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,660
know with a strap

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,538
next thing I know she collapses and it's

140
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,759
like falling on top of me and I'm like

141
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:59,159
what's going on so I spin around and

142
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,100
when I sping her and spin around my

143
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,680
camera spins around and clocks are in

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,960
the head it was like it was like a

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,819
one-two punch

146
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,099
she was going down from the chem dog and

147
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,139
then my camera

148
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,939
and she had to get taken to like rock

149
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,740
Med over there and they're like what is

150
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:20,639
she on what happened and I was like it's

151
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:25,079
just weed it's really good weed and like

152
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,300
you know so so yeah I've had a number of

153
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,199
times when I shared the chem dog with

154
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,478
people

155
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,800
and it didn't go good after a while I

156
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,800
started just telling people like Francis

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,900
said like you know I'd be like no sorry

158
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,639
you know and

159
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,459
that just makes him want it more like

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,500
people people thought people thought we

161
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,939
were being dicks and like Gabby and I

162
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,439
would be having these conversations like

163
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,360
are we gonna ruin this person's

164
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,459
experience by being cool

165
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,580
yeah you know it was like an on it

166
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,579
happened

167
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,120
I've been telling everyone I'm stingy

168
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,139
because like five thousand people

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,259
you know on Discord that Gabby is

170
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,418
[ __ ] just stingy holding on to it all

171
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,840
Gabby

172
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:15,538
right I mean I uh

173
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,159
that's funny

174
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:20,219
I will say I don't know I don't know if

175
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,860
you heard this part uh Gabby but I I

176
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,620
have mentioned a few times how like when

177
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,660
we were doing all of those when we were

178
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,038
making those like super dog hybrids and

179
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,139
we were playing around and we were doing

180
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,240
all those outcrosses and stuff

181
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,699
Gabby was honestly like one of the

182
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,519
people like earliest people amongst my

183
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,240
entire friend crew that sort of saw like

184
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:44,038
the future American Seed sales coming

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,720
and he used to talk to me and be like

186
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,538
dude we could we could take this eight

187
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,580
lighter you know because we did Big seed

188
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,500
runs you know we take this eight lighter

189
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,359
and he's like we could make so many

190
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,060
seeds with this eight lighter it would

191
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,639
just blow anything you could do with

192
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,860
flour out of the window yeah like we

193
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,660
could sell so many seeds and it was like

194
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,340
so early it was this was I don't know

195
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,560
when it was probably early 2000s or

196
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,079
something it was so early it was long

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,259
before you know seed companies in

198
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,639
America and IG made it like feasible I

199
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,560
honestly like we'd get into arguments

200
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,060
and I was like I don't see it dude I

201
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,139
don't see how to be able to do it I

202
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,720
don't see how we'd be able to have

203
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,699
customers all these take money and all

204
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,919
these people

205
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,960
no we couldn't at the time

206
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,878
but you were right you saw what was

207
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,680
coming and I was like you know later

208
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,658
it's not it's not gonna work and then

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,360
like 10 years later I was like man we

210
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:38,458
were just like too early business models

211
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,139
that are built on volume

212
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,838
and there's business models that are

213
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,759
built on scarcity you know and the

214
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,100
margins are very different you know if

215
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,200
you have huge volume you can have

216
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,139
smaller margins

217
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,120
you know if you've got big volume if

218
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,259
you've got big margins you don't need

219
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,019
huge

220
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,200
yeah I mean it's crazy because it's kind

221
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,120
of the same thing with clones right now

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,339
except it's more like people taking

223
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,379
advantage like selling [ __ ] for like

224
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,100
fifteen hundred dollars a piece that's

225
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,240
just like a garbage cross you know just

226
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,459
because they made a good name for

227
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,379
themselves and like at the emerald cup

228
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,778
people will be waiting online for like

229
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,299
the entire Emerald cup to pay fifteen

230
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:24,419
hundred dollars for for clones that

231
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:28,859
ended up having virus yep you know like

232
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:33,120
yep it was just you know I mean it's

233
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:38,459
part of it is successful branding and

234
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:41,879
then not being honorable about it yes

235
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:44,219
very much though I mean they it sucks

236
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,320
because I think it's a flawed business

237
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,180
plan because as soon as you build up

238
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,220
your business to the point where like

239
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,199
you have all these people that respect

240
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,759
you and think that you're awesome

241
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,660
and then all of a sudden you [ __ ]

242
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,580
everybody and the word gets out and like

243
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,740
it's so much worse now

244
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,720
I heard a lot of stories about deals

245
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,680
that went bad with them I I mean I don't

246
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,120
know if you want to cut this out because

247
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,979
I ain't trying to think about [ __ ] about

248
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,320
people but um

249
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,480
you know he had contracts with people

250
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,700
that he had to give them like they had

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,519
to give a certain dollar amount for

252
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,580
their crop and their crop got completely

253
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,440
ruined because it was all virus yeah and

254
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,080
he still wanted his money

255
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,839
yeah like he destroyed these people's

256
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,180
livelihood by giving them like

257
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,980
infected and I'm not saying he did it on

258
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,259
purpose but like you give people

259
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,200
infected genetics and then you sue them

260
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,819
for not giving you the 200 bucks that

261
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,278
like you know they you know and

262
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,459
meanwhile these people couldn't get 300

263
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:47,759
bucks or 400 bucks for like quality herb

264
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:50,099
that was you know yeah it was just like

265
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,620
I mean the thing is is like Francis and

266
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,860
I said the seeds are so cheap

267
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,139
right that if you have a problem

268
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,360
like this is an opportunity to show

269
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,639
people that you're solid or that you're

270
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,039
a scammer exactly that could have

271
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,139
happened to anyone that you know the

272
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,539
seeds were no good whatever

273
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,338
they just need to be like look we stand

274
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,199
behind you know our name and our product

275
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,899
and anyone that bought that is going to

276
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,399
get you know not just their seeds

277
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,259
replaced they're gonna get extra stuff

278
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,360
and yeah you know wasting their time

279
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,519
make the customer feel good because in

280
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,680
the end the seeds don't cost you [ __ ]

281
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,560
yep you know and like you took so much

282
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,319
into making your reputation

283
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,958
how do you just screw so many people

284
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,720
over let the whole world know that that

285
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,458
you're terrible and [ __ ] over your

286
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,160
entire business I don't understand how

287
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:43,078
people do that I run into this all the

288
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,500
time Gabby when we chat where it's like

289
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,778
a lot of times I will talk in

290
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,820
generalities about like certain things

291
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,740
that go on in the community because even

292
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,160
just telling stories that are true

293
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,019
people get mad but if you mention like

294
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,659
when we if I mention somebody's name

295
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,299
specifically as an example their friends

296
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:05,639
will like cut out that 15 second clip

297
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:08,458
and send it to them and then I'll have

298
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,559
like furious people in my DMs all mad

299
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,359
that I'm like trying to like [ __ ] with

300
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,059
their wallet or destroy their way of

301
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,100
life or like disparage them in some

302
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,539
fashion you know okay so one thing that

303
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,879
I want to say that's not really a story

304
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,699
I don't know if it was

305
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,639
so dog or someone else in the Discord

306
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,220
that said that what people appreciate me

307
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,919
is that I didn't Flex

308
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,720
yeah and

309
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,159
you know I thought about it and I said

310
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,879
to myself

311
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:41,759
I'm not opposed to flexing yeah for [ __ ]

312
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,120
that actually I can Flex about I don't

313
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,939
feel I don't feel like I'm that response

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,299
for it and there's other things that I'm

315
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:54,839
so much more proud of like yeah my hydro

316
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:58,139
store the garden spell you know I I had

317
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,600
the first real Grow shops in Mendocino

318
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,700
County there was Spare Time Supply but

319
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,399
they sold lights in the back of an ocean

320
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,940
container to people that knew about them

321
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,600
yeah you know I opened up

322
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,660
I opened up a grow store in Willits at

323
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,300
the time Highway 101

324
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,939
stopped being a highway and just was

325
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:23,278
like a one lane in each Direction Road

326
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,220
through the town of Willards so anyone

327
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,299
traveling north would drive straight

328
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,560
through town

329
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:34,078
yeah and I got this little store on Main

330
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,179
Street what I was saying was that when I

331
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,559
put my store up it was right on Highway

332
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,979
101

333
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,979
and I literally lit up the highway with

334
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,800
the orange glow of high pressure

335
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,740
frames and it was the Talk of the Town

336
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,479
like nobody could believe that I was

337
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,339
being so ballsy

338
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,180
to like put these lights up in the

339
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,940
street

340
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,838
yeah you know and

341
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,899
um

342
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,720
you know one by one you know the locals

343
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,159
from the hills came down and they heard

344
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,399
that they could trust me and that I

345
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,860
would deliver soil to them holy [ __ ] I

346
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,419
delivered soil in the most dangerous and

347
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,240
not like dangerous like gun dangerous

348
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:17,039
like the roads were just psychotic but

349
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,019
if I would have known I never would have

350
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,578
done it you know you get like committed

351
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,220
to this drive and now you can't turn

352
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:26,219
around yeah driving this like U-Haul

353
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,620
style box truck it's overloaded me with

354
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,540
soil through like 10 creeks and [ __ ]

355
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,480
you're like oh my God

356
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:35,759
but um I taught a lot of people how to

357
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,860
grow weed and I taught a lot of people

358
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,480
how to grow better weed than they were

359
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,639
already growing

360
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,720
and

361
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,899
brought new products to our Market

362
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,100
and that's the stuff that I'm really

363
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,958
proud of

364
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,199
and

365
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,239
it's not that I um

366
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,059
didn't always love cannabis and always

367
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,198
grow cannabis but for a long part of my

368
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,599
life

369
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,639
okay so let me take a step back here's

370
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,399
how the story went

371
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,039
when I was growing before working and

372
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,839
and owning hydro stores

373
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,360
I was paranoid

374
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,880
and I wasn't making friends

375
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,300
and I wasn't talking to people about

376
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,759
growing weed which is what I realized I

377
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,979
really like to do is talk to people

378
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,958
about growing weed which is one of the

379
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,259
reasons why me and not so dog got along

380
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,578
so good like because that's what what he

381
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,860
wanted to do too

382
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:37,620
and um

383
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,839
what happened was one day the hydro

384
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,519
store that I was shopping at it's called

385
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,060
Hydro Depot

386
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,578
the guy asked me if I wanted a job

387
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:49,379
and at first I was like no I don't want

388
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:51,299
a job you know I'm doing pretty good

389
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,338
doing what I'm doing

390
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,919
and then I realized

391
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,860
that if I got this job

392
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,139
and I worked it for a few months I could

393
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,959
make a legitimate income and then like

394
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,720
maybe work towards buying a house

395
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,859
instead of like you know renting my

396
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,639
entire life

397
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,100
so I started working at the Hydro Depot

398
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,860
and that's when I realized that as much

399
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,199
as I have a passion for growing

400
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,899
have a passion for talking to people

401
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,539
about weed and teaching people what I

402
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,720
know about weed and

403
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:29,698
I really felt like my calling

404
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,699
was to do that

405
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,139
because not only was I making a good

406
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,139
living

407
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:40,440
I was loving every minute of it you know

408
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:43,198
when when clients would come in

409
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,639
I would love talking to them you know

410
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,278
like

411
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,659
you know I let other people handle the

412
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:54,720
inventory and the you know

413
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:56,819
all the you know boring stuff of running

414
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,560
a business and I would just talk to

415
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,920
people about growing weed

416
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:04,500
and I was always really honest with them

417
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:07,019
and that's why people came back

418
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,400
you know because they knew I wasn't just

419
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,139
trying to sell them some [ __ ] because

420
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,459
oftentimes people would come in and be

421
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,520
like should I buy this and I'd be like

422
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,919
absolutely not don't do it you know

423
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,179
perfect example was LED lights before

424
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,000
they were ready

425
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,880
you know when I opened up my store it

426
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,338
was a 2002 there was already people

427
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,760
trying to sell LED lights

428
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:33,000
you remember the UFOs Francis oh yeah

429
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,798
you know I mean they were garbage they

430
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,298
you couldn't successfully grow basil

431
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,259
with those plants let alone a fruiting

432
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:40,440
crop

433
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:42,839
and um and they sold for a lot of money

434
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,759
and I used to tell people if this

435
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,699
technology worked

436
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:50,160
I would make so much money because

437
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,600
everybody would want to change everybody

438
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,419
with high pressure sodium would

439
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:57,240
immediately want to buy these these LEDs

440
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,520
I would kill it yeah but I couldn't with

441
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,140
good conscious so even though people

442
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,418
coming in like wanting the lights and

443
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,360
I'd have to be like no it's a bad idea

444
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:09,059
you know and so I'm proud

445
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,279
and this is a very minor Flex that I

446
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,980
feel throughout the years I made a good

447
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,899
reputation for myself

448
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,538
um with Growers

449
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,820
because I was honest and I was a place

450
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:22,200
where they could come for information

451
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:26,038
and

452
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,660
they felt safe yeah you know people felt

453
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,400
safe at my store

454
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,779
and

455
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,640
you know so when we're talking about

456
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,558
flexing it's like

457
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,140
I think I can Flex about that a little

458
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,240
bit I'm proud of proud of that I hope

459
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,179
that that's you know

460
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,839
it's gonna be a part of my legacy you

461
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,759
know when I'm gone for sure

462
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:52,079
the chem dog thing is just like

463
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,599
you know well I don't think I mean I'm

464
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,399
blushing and you know like kind of like

465
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,678
it it makes me smile that I'm getting

466
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,919
this attention about it but like

467
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,679
Greg he's the one that popped the seeds

468
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,720
people that he distributed to like what

469
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,700
do they get the credit for like where do

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,538
you draw the line of giving people props

471
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:17,100
for me is it you Francis is it Jason and

472
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:18,839
Ben or like people 10 10 rows past them

473
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,000
that got it that

474
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,199
maybe did better [ __ ] with it than all

475
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,200
of us

476
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,319
well you know I mean

477
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,240
I look at it a little different you know

478
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,619
um I'll I'll talk about the chem dog for

479
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,000
a second and then I'll move on to the

480
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:34,619
store because I actually think there's

481
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,679
some parts about the store that people

482
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:40,019
would not really realize today but I'll

483
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,519
start with the chem dog obviously I

484
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,440
think that

485
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,000
you know for whatever reason even though

486
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,880
it might be like even though people

487
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,819
might play a small role in something

488
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,000
that role could be super important like

489
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:57,119
it turns out somehow that the cutting

490
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,038
that you brought West seems to be the

491
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,678
one that survived

492
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:05,279
and it got and I'm not sure if it would

493
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,080
be around if you hadn't come out to

494
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,200
California with it and then eventually

495
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:13,319
shared it with a few close friends uh

496
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,980
like skunk VA or IC Collective or myself

497
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,899
or whoever and so you know like that

498
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,140
might be small but it's also important

499
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,759
because it was a critical step like when

500
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,500
they wanted it back on the East Coast

501
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,919
they had to get it from the West Coast

502
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,079
because that's where and in prohibition

503
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,660
right where people get busted and people

504
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,460
move on and things change a lot of cool

505
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,400
things got lost

506
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:41,279
right and so I kind of feel like my only

507
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,740
part of the chemdog story is really like

508
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,918
hearing the stories early

509
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,798
right and maybe helping to preserve it

510
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,179
at a time before it was famous

511
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,379
and then

512
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,538
like and so perhaps like on the on the

513
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,220
the store thing people might not realize

514
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:00,839
this but one of the things that Gabby

515
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,319
was talking about which was critical

516
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,418
back then was that information on how to

517
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,139
grow good weed was really hard to come

518
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,360
by

519
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,259
and most people that knew how to do it

520
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,719
wouldn't talk to you so in stores were

521
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,298
also super rare like Gabby is right when

522
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,038
he opened up his store he was the first

523
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:21,298
go ahead if you want to make me blush

524
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,940
Francis you can repeat yourself all

525
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:27,960
right so so I do feel like things about

526
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:31,580
me as as Gabby mentioned when he opened

527
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:34,259
up the store in in Mendocino County

528
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:35,699
there was like Spare Time Supply which

529
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,919
was a big player but they were

530
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,720
predominantly a garden store at an

531
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,080
outdoor store and an amendment store

532
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:47,038
there was no indoor or Greenhouse

533
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:49,379
focused store going on at all and stores

534
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,640
back then were actually rare

535
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,320
right

536
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,080
um and and there wasn't very many of

537
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,960
them and having someone in a store that

538
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:02,339
was knowledgeable and willing to talk

539
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,620
right was huge and it was kind of a

540
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:08,158
risque thing and even though proposition

541
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:12,058
215 had happened it was still very much

542
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,919
in the shadows and so he's he I think he

543
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:16,319
sort of opened up your shop at the very

544
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,538
beginning of like the 215 medical green

545
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,279
Rush era where there was all these

546
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:21,779
people coming to our County and coming

547
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,058
to Humboldt in these different areas

548
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,038
that were new they had no idea what they

549
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:28,200
were doing and they were like I want to

550
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,940
set up a garage in a greenhouse and I

551
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,000
don't even know what to get

552
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,279
and so for a long time it was like

553
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,900
eventually stores became like who had

554
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,940
the best price and people were more

555
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,298
knowledgeable but probably for the first

556
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,779
five or six years that Gabby had a store

557
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:48,839
it was I mean he sold stuff but it was

558
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,359
also like it was tons of education on

559
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,058
what stuff those people needed so you

560
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,879
know the store in the early years was

561
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:59,879
basically like a massive educational

562
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,220
model and then as Gabby and then you

563
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,240
know educated people they bought things

564
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,159
from him

565
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,538
yeah because they literally hadn't they

566
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,280
didn't know how to wire stuff they

567
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:09,779
didn't know about like you know lighting

568
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,418
boxes they didn't know about fan

569
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,279
movement they didn't know about any of

570
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:17,340
that and so it's like they'd have money

571
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,379
and they're like What's the best set of

572
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,798
equipment for my set of circumstances

573
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,320
and so you have this whole County that

574
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,599
was starting to really blow up and grow

575
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,700
but the funny thing about it is all the

576
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,158
stores that opened up they were all my

577
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,360
customers first yeah like I literally I

578
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,700
literally taught him everything that

579
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,579
they knew about the business people

580
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,220
don't realize it today but

581
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:43,259
like information

582
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,419
was the thing that was super important

583
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:48,058
people literally they had money but they

584
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,580
had no idea what they were doing and

585
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:53,460
like what's weird about it too is that

586
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,980
you start like if you spent time there

587
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,659
you learned a bunch because people would

588
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,220
come to you not only to get set up but

589
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,020
they would come to you with like every

590
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,179
problem imaginable

591
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,740
yeah and you would have to and Gabby

592
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,720
would have to sit down with them and

593
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,058
figure out how to solve it

594
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,298
and then the more you help people solve

595
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:15,240
it the bigger your like information or

596
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:17,038
expertise or knowledge base grows so

597
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,279
when someone else brings up that same

598
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,960
problem like you have right and so I

599
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,759
don't think people today with all the

600
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,200
all the forums and all the information

601
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,919
and all the internet and everything

602
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,960
really understand how hard it was

603
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,259
to talk to people that knew how to grow

604
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,720
weed even on the basic level

605
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:39,658
like and so probably the first five or

606
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,360
six years his store was open it was a

607
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:44,220
boom time where everyone in Mendo and

608
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,099
Humboldt and all these places were just

609
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,480
constantly setting up new stuff whether

610
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,038
they were indoor whether they were

611
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,819
greenhouses whether they were light

612
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:57,779
deprivation it was just an enormous boom

613
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:59,460
of economy and no and ver and maybe 10

614
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:01,740
of the people knew what they were doing

615
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,419
and would come in and like would have a

616
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,000
good idea of what they wanted and battle

617
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,538
on price and stuff but often they would

618
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,759
come in completely oblivious

619
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:14,279
you know and so and so I I just wanted

620
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,759
to mention that I don't think into in

621
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:21,178
2023 people understand like Dragon Ball

622
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,640
Z having a hydrostore was and being

623
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,640
willing to openly talk about

624
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,500
you know about growing with people

625
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,419
you know I mean that was the era where

626
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,220
like you walk into a head shop and you

627
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,840
say the word bong and they toss you out

628
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,640
in case you were undercover and they

629
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,278
were going to shut down the real shop

630
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,380
for real right yeah um you know there

631
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:43,200
was you know there was a so it was

632
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,600
pretty risque it was like pretty out on

633
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,480
the on the on the Cutting Edge of things

634
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,278
if you will uh to do that type of stuff

635
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,700
and so there's an enormous amount of

636
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:57,000
people that got their start buying

637
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,860
equipment and buying soil and buying all

638
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,480
kinds of stuff I mean one thing I could

639
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:03,599
mention is like when you opened your

640
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,298
shop dude uh we were still all growing

641
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,599
in like in um you know in like a light

642
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:11,460
Warrior or you know or perlite peat moss

643
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,798
mixes and stuff like that Gabby was one

644
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,319
of the first people to really like

645
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,480
preach about cocoa fiber

646
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,240
and how it was going to revolutionize

647
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,339
like growing

648
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:27,240
and you know people had no idea what it

649
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:30,599
was that's wow like at all you know and

650
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,720
it was brand new okay go ahead so what I

651
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,819
remember is that you know cocoa fiber if

652
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,700
I if I remember correctly the reason why

653
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:41,038
it became popular was in Europe they

654
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,140
decided that they wanted more

655
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:47,099
environmentally friendly medium to grow

656
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,419
in right and Rockwell wasn't it and so

657
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,459
they were looking around for something

658
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,640
that was biodegradable and a renewable

659
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,640
resource and they realized that there

660
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,820
was these giant piles of cocoa fiber and

661
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,500
Sri Lanka and India and other places

662
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:04,139
that were just waste products that they

663
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,839
shredded off the cocoa to get to the

664
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,580
coconut yeah right

665
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:10,439
and so they realized that if they

666
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:11,399
started buffering it and treating it the

667
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,038
right way

668
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,900
that you know

669
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,140
um it could be an excellent grow media

670
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,120
yeah and then Gabby got some

671
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,580
and there was stuff that was from like

672
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,099
because in Canada that was RHP certified

673
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,658
which basically meant it was regulated

674
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:30,178
and it was guaranteed to be a certain

675
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:32,340
level of quality and we started growing

676
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:34,440
in it and I remember Gabby being like Oh

677
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,658
my god dude like we'd pull pot he'd pull

678
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,360
plants out of pots and be like look at

679
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,400
these roots I bet like literally like

680
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,798
look at how white and happy look at look

681
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,419
at and from that point on he was kind of

682
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:47,278
like a little bit of a prophet about it

683
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:50,159
and no one had ever really heard about

684
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:53,940
it and his store had it

685
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,860
um and I think we he got lucky and that

686
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,140
he was getting it from reputable sources

687
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,819
yeah and there there was other people

688
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,559
that were getting it cheaper but they

689
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,839
were getting it full of like sea salt

690
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,119
and it was unbuffered and people were

691
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,220
having nightmares in the beginning oh

692
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:11,099
sure right

693
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,620
um but I mean his store was open right

694
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,418
at the time that like cocoa fiber first

695
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:16,798
started percolating around and no one

696
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,720
had even heard of it

697
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,000
you know

698
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,620
um and you know people back then they

699
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,558
didn't even know you know it was even

700
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:27,658
simple stuff like why 600s were better

701
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:29,220
than thousands because they were cooler

702
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,140
and they gave you more points of light

703
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,880
yeah you know

704
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,700
um there was a lot of stuff that people

705
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,220
consider basic now which was like

706
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,720
essentially in my opinion like hidden

707
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,839
knowledge

708
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,919
and so he's right he would just talk all

709
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,240
day long

710
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,159
to people

711
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,079
and they would write out all kinds of

712
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,000
lists of stuff they needed and then he

713
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,278
would hand the list to like an employee

714
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,480
and they would start filling it and he

715
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,759
would turn around and he would talk to

716
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,159
the next person

717
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,140
and so he just talked about growing weed

718
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,778
like here's the reality

719
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,659
Francis was way better than I was really

720
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:08,720
yeah well you know he was like yeah I

721
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,720
mean

722
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,140
he had patience

723
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,740
and I'm just like always like I'm trying

724
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,740
to help people as quick

725
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,740
as quick I mean I wanted it wasn't like

726
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,419
I was rushing him out the door I wanted

727
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,819
to make a comfortable environment but I

728
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:28,259
was just always busy too one thing like

729
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:31,319
I tried myself in so my hydro store was

730
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:33,599
based on largely

731
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,538
a Dutch model

732
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,740
and the Dutch model was I went to

733
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:40,919
Holland

734
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,960
and I went to the growth stores

735
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:46,620
and they all had espresso makers there

736
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,659
and

737
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,579
I had this idea

738
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,720
okay because when I was working for

739
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,898
Slavic

740
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,419
she would always say to me gabby I want

741
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:01,019
them to buy and get out

742
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:02,700
and what I try to tell him is that the

743
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:04,558
longer they stayed

744
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,500
I got opportunities to sell them more

745
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,359
stuff yeah you know he would see he

746
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,519
would see it as I'm just talking to

747
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,979
these guys you know for 45 minutes about

748
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,418
growing you know and that you know he'd

749
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,120
rather maybe sweeping the floor or

750
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,679
something else yeah but in the end what

751
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,058
I was doing was building a repertoire

752
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,179
with the customers

753
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:26,599
you know that they would trust me and

754
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,500
they would shop exclusively at our store

755
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,898
you know

756
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,179
it would trust me so when I opened up my

757
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:36,000
own stores the garden spout

758
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,759
you know I put a coffee bar in

759
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,339
yeah and I had chairs there for the

760
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,379
customers to hang out

761
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,199
and that was pretty unheard of for a

762
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,360
growth store was to make a place like I

763
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,000
wanted it to be a cool place

764
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,798
where people want to hang out yeah you

765
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,359
know and of course some people abuse the

766
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,599
privilege and got annoying and we'd have

767
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,099
to ask him to leave of course but for

768
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,259
the most part like

769
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:03,359
it wasn't only me talking to people

770
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,879
other people would like hear what people

771
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,879
were saying and then they would like

772
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,960
interject and it became like almost a

773
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,360
gathering point

774
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,620
you know so as far as how I got involved

775
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:15,599
with the Coco

776
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:19,019
it's because that's what the Dutch were

777
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,058
doing okay and I met people while I was

778
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,579
in Holland

779
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:27,778
um at the Hawaii Fair which is like a

780
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:30,240
traditional AG show yeah and um

781
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:32,220
and then when I opened up my store they

782
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,000
had heard about it they came and visited

783
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,798
me

784
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,659
and you know so the first one we would

785
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,418
buy because Coco

786
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,980
and then Tana Coco and then you know I

787
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,320
started trying to Source some myself

788
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,599
from some of these reputable companies

789
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,700
but

790
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,259
like I said like those are the things

791
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,600
that I want to be proud of

792
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:54,720
you know to me that that's like

793
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,480
a much bigger

794
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,640
you know I think that's my minor Flex

795
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,500
you know I think it's a one thing I want

796
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,419
to say about the chem dog Flex go ahead

797
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,720
how much of an [ __ ] would I look like

798
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,460
if I did Flex about my part with the

799
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,440
chem dub

800
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,840
I mean I think I'd be in like I'd be

801
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,519
looked at like an [ __ ] like like

802
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:16,079
you're saying other people think others

803
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,418
are [ __ ] who are doing that Flex

804
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:23,158
yeah you know the only one who's got the

805
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:25,500
real Flex is Greg yeah you know and like

806
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,539
anyone else past that it's just kind of

807
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,460
like all right you have it what did you

808
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:32,398
do with it yeah and you know like

809
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,259
Francis said people did good [ __ ] I

810
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,339
think Jason made beautiful crosses with

811
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:37,980

yeah

827
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,000
yeah I mean

828
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,558
I love this yeah I think it goes back to

829
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:25,259
a different era

830
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:28,798
where the way you got Cuts generally

831
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:31,740
speaking back then was like you honestly

832
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,720
became good friends with someone and

833
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,880
then what was that like and then you

834
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,220
shared things and then you did things

835
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,039
together and you now people would call

836
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,558
it a collaboration but back in the day

837
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,740
it was more just like you know friends

838
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,898
doing cool little side projects together

839
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,880
you know like friends sharing Cuts so we

840
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:53,759
could help keep them alive because there

841
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,320
was fires and accidents and busts and

842
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,658
different things that could happen where

843
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,259
you could lose something and it was much

844
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,640
more informal so it was like you know

845
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:04,140
um you know sometimes people would be

846
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,059
like well how do you get cuts and it's

847
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,980
like I don't know you like become

848
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,539
friends with someone that has Cuts but

849
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,878
that's not the reason why you became

850
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:14,519
friends it's like you have an honest

851
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,098
relationship with someone and then that

852
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,079
leads to other things yeah

853
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:21,419
you know so it's almost like organic in

854
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,480
the way that it like it developed

855
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,799
you know uh and um

856
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,619
I don't know that's just kind of how I

857
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,240
see it but I think I think it's very one

858
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:33,059
thing that

859
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,658
it's not necessarily a flex but I think

860
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:39,539
it's very very uh special to be someone

861
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:42,838
who inspires someone else who does

862
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:45,418
something quite remarkable it changes a

863
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,820
culture whether it's sour whether it's

864
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:50,579
cam whether it's getting to the West

865
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,919
Coast but helping inspiring other

866
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,500
whether you're teaching growing any of

867
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,118
that to be able to to like know on your

868
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,679
deathbed that you've left something

869
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,960
behind that has inspired someone else

870
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,579
and made their life better then that's

871
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
that you know I mean like that should be

872
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:06,900
good enough right that's ultimate I

873
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,539
think so that's why I said like if you

874
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,300
called up and said hey Gabby

875
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:14,579
I was talking with not so dog and we

876
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,880
want to talk to you about the garden

877
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:20,039
spout and how you you know accomplish so

878
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,380
much and then it'd be like all right

879
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,659
yeah I mean like I'm proud of that and I

880
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,780
can actually like you know

881
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:29,519
you know but like this idea that I had

882
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,760
such an integral

883
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,380
part of it I mean I had a little part of

884
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,060
it I brought it out to the West Coast I

885
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,740
don't want to minimize it either like

886
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:39,900
because I know if I didn't bring it out

887
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:43,199
then it's not out here and maybe it's

888
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,900
lost but um products that we did I wish

889
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,519
the breeding projects that we did

890
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,220
produced more of like what I actually

891
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:53,519
wanted yeah you know like more of a chem

892
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:55,799
dog you know tramping profile because we

893
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,759
we did some great [ __ ] but it just

894
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,079
didn't turn out that dog-like and so if

895
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,720
I would have done that

896
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,220
then I could have been proud of that and

897
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,439
then I could have felt like I had more

898
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:10,739
of a part of the chem dog history

899
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:15,240
because I took it to the next step and

900
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:17,759
maybe that is a reason for Jason and Ben

901
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:20,519
to flex because that is what they're

902
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,920
doing right sure they're taking plants

903
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,079
that

904
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,539
pretty much it would be a mistake for

905
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,519
most people to grow it period

906
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:30,900
you know like unless you're looking to

907
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,759
use it for breeding

908
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,800
you know like growing this for the

909
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,660
flower

910
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,539
you know and having said that I want to

911
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:42,358
grow it for flower again because

912
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,159
I feel like I have knowledge and tools

913
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:45,480
available to me now that I didn't have

914
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,719
then

915
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,099
and maybe I could get it to show me

916
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,879
something

917
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,260
you know better than back in the day

918
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,000
absolutely you know

919
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,060
um the one thing I was mentioning in the

920
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,219
Discord is leaf tissue sampling yeah

921
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:03,900
yeah that blew my mind I hadn't even

922
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:05,459
thought of doing that with it

923
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,858
yeah so I've already done this at

924
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,480
facilities that I worked with worked at

925
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,980
and

926
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,139
so

927
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,659
I'm I don't know who to give credit to

928
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:18,598
but somebody mentioned to me that you

929
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:20,279
know we've been looking in books at this

930
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,619
is what this deficiency looks like this

931
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,260
one this efficiency looks like

932
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,000
but generally what that means is this is

933
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,700
what a plant looks like when it has zero

934
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,480
nitrogen or like it's not deficient it's

935
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:36,539
just absent yeah and all and also

936
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,260
or extreme deficiency right yeah and

937
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:43,199
then also those photos never show you

938
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:46,079
what does deficiency look like when it's

939
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,239
a number of elements yeah that's true

940
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,400
you know like because what it's going to

941
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,979
look like is going to look different

942
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,139
and you know for years

943
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,440
the standard thing was oh I had more

944
00:37:55,139 --> 00:38:00,719
calmag yeah yeah well what kind of

945
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,460
whatever it was just add more calmag it

946
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,259
always makes everything better yeah it

947
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,440
always makes it green

948
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,520
plants like calcium and when I did my

949
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,079
testing

950
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,619
the testing showed that I needed more

951
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,200
calcium okay but at least we're not just

952
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,960
guessing yeah you know the testing is

953
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:24,118
really inexpensive it's like 75 to 100

954
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,280
per sample okay okay and so it's very

955
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,579
inexpensive and it gives you a lot of

956
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,900
information and with the chem dog being

957
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:36,900
a plant that wants to consume itself

958
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,579
prior to harvest like you know two weeks

959
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,680
before you're supposed to cut it you'd

960
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:44,280
have not a single Green Leaf left on it

961
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:46,440
yeah no no it was so hard to keep this

962
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,400
plant yeah

963
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,440
um with a with the leaf analysis we can

964
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,680
learn how to feed it a little bit better

965
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,220
and maybe keep it Greener a little bit

966
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:02,239
longer and action you know actually get

967
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:02,239
a product that

968
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,160
is more like what we've been looking for

969
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,338
all this time

970
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:11,338
sure one of the one other thing I I

971
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:14,338
might mention if we're gonna like uh

972
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:16,619
Flex for Gabby here or whatever is

973
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:18,539
that's not what time this is is it I

974
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:20,460
know but but I know we did enough of

975
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,619
that you know I used to go I used to go

976
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,780
and do a bunch of different hydro stores

977
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:27,119
um for various reasons and I think Gabby

978
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,800
was the first person that I knew that

979
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,480
was really pumping

980
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,660
tissue culture

981
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,460
not like the meristem stuff but like the

982
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:37,920
prop like the cleanliness and the

983
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,659
propagation and all that and there was

984
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,539
this guy

985
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:46,019
um Bill Graham bill yeah still around

986
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:49,880
and she had these and he had these kits

987
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:52,739
uh and he Gabby used to have bill.com

988
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,780
for people didn't want to look for it he

989
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:57,419
used to come into the store and Gabby

990
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:01,260
would have him do demos

991
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:04,559
of how to sterilize like a tub how to

992
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:07,079
get clean how to like take clean cuts

993
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,078
and like bleach and sterilize the cuts

994
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,560
and then get them into solution and I

995
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,359
can tell you like as a as a grower it

996
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:18,838
looked like some Voodoo in the beginning

997
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:21,059
I bet you know like at the time nobody

998
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,099
was doing that nobody was even thinking

999
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:25,559
about it like nobody was nobody was

1000
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,240
applying that to cannabis by by any

1001
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,400
means yeah

1002
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:31,078
um and you know he had a whole shelf on

1003
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,760
his store and he would invite bill in

1004
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,560
and he would and they would do Demos in

1005
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,160
the shop and he would get people to try

1006
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,719
it wow and all that type of stuff and I

1007
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,000
mean that was literally in the early

1008
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,219
2000s

1009
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,900
uh long now it's become like a big the

1010
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:47,759
only reason that made me think of it is

1011
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,760
as you were talking Gabby about Leaf

1012
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,700
tissue like I kind of feel like because

1013
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,060
weed was so illegal for a while we were

1014
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:59,219
reduced to observational stuff and we

1015
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:01,019
didn't really have access to labs and we

1016
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:03,299
didn't really have access to some of the

1017
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:07,079
scientific stuff that regular AG did

1018
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,359
because we were too scared and the labs

1019
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,480
didn't want to deal with us so we had to

1020
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,940
like work off what we saw

1021
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,920
and talking amongst ourselves and now

1022
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,740
he's right in the sense that you can go

1023
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,280
get tissue analysis and you can get hard

1024
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:25,199
data that backs up your thoughts

1025
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,839
right yeah

1026
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,460
um but you know tissue culture was like

1027
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,619
some voodoo

1028
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,559
you know taking these tiny little

1029
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:36,300
plantlets it seemed very extreme at the

1030
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,799
time like why would you go through all

1031
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,599
that trouble when you just clogged it

1032
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,820
seemed extreme but now knowing more

1033
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,519
about diseases you know hopsilating

1034
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,079
viroid and stuff it's I wish everyone

1035
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,259
would have been using that method and

1036
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,000
you know Bill Bill would come in and and

1037
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,760
you know Gabby would tell a bunch of

1038
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,320
good customers and friends and stuff the

1039
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,480
dude's gonna come in and he's going to

1040
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,460
give a demo and he's going to teach you

1041
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,559
how to use this stuff because it was

1042
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,358
like especially to a bunch of Growers it

1043
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,119
was like some straight Voodoo it was

1044
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,098
Advanced so let me say something let me

1045
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,940
let me say something real fast

1046
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:14,400
so I sold a bunch of those kits

1047
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,679
yeah and I honestly believe almost no

1048
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,800
one took it out of the box I believe it

1049
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,259
because it was still it was still too

1050
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,420
like intimidating like the kid didn't

1051
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,460
cost [ __ ] I think it was like 135 bucks

1052
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,139
yeah yeah something like that you know

1053
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,880
it was really inexpensive but they had

1054
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:32,219
to go buy a pressure cooker and make the

1055
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,059
gel and like you know I was able to sell

1056
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,519
it

1057
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:37,679
but like most people were still a little

1058
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,980
bit intimidated to do it and I remember

1059
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,980
I was

1060
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,960
store and we do it

1061
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,960
and then every single day

1062
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,699
I was doing tissue culture in my store

1063
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,420
in front of people that were just

1064
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:57,419
walking in and

1065
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,139
you know

1066
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,300
even though they didn't do it

1067
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:05,400
they were still like inspired and it

1068
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,440
made them excited about something you

1069
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,338
know exactly so

1070
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,780
um

1071
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:13,759
but yeah a few people actually did it

1072
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,540
um

1073
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,599
I really thought I was gonna

1074
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:21,300
revolutionize things I like people

1075
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,519
adopting this and doing this

1076
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,700
and it was kind of like the seed thing

1077
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,039
they just weren't ready yet yeah I mean

1078
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:31,858
the same thing is interesting in that

1079
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,960
you know I I talk about this on the show

1080
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,940
quite often where it was like

1081
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,818
you know Gabby and I and some other

1082
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:42,300
close like we honestly were just trying

1083
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:44,039
to make better wheat and all the seeds

1084
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,200
we made all the projects that we did

1085
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,599
everything like that especially because

1086
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:50,578
of what like flower prices were back

1087
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,920
then it was a terrible financial

1088
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:56,039
decision because we could have just been

1089
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,740
blowing up rooms of flour and getting

1090
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,460
top dollar for it way back then you know

1091
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:03,838
so it was literally like a labor of love

1092
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,639
you know and it was it wasn't

1093
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,519
necessarily about like oh what do we

1094
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:11,759
think people will like it was like what

1095
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,380
do we like personally and can we make

1096
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,720
stuff that we like

1097
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,039
and you know Gabby I I was thinking

1098
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,858
about it because

1099
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,960
uh Matt and I have been blessed in a way

1100
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,818
to talk to some of like Neville's good

1101
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,619
friends that were close to him in the

1102
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:27,779
last years of his life

1103
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,760
and it's funny because one of the things

1104
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,560
Neville said is like I wish I didn't

1105
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,440
fail so much

1106
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,358
right I don't know if I did if I don't

1107
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,099
know if the best stuff that I got I

1108
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:40,858
improved on it at all

1109
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:43,079
I wish I knew now I wish I would have

1110
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:44,639
known then what I know now and I had a

1111
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,740
different shot at it

1112
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,139
and so I think that thing that you

1113
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:51,659
expressed is very common in breeding

1114
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:52,980
where people that breed are very

1115
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:55,739
self-critical

1116
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,300
and they tend to Discount what they did

1117
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:00,239
when they did it

1118
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,940
because they wanted it to be better

1119
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,459
and they had their own goals in it and

1120
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,579
then a lot of failure I mean there's a

1121
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,679
lot of things if you take it serious it

1122
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,960
has to be a lot of failure because you

1123
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:15,000
you'd just be hitting you know numbers

1124
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,980
all day and that's that's just not how

1125
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,719
it works that's not how I mean I I don't

1126
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,039
think it I don't think it's failure in

1127
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,899
the sense of

1128
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:25,739
do something beautiful

1129
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:28,740
it's a failure in the sense of you have

1130
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:31,199
an expectation of what you can produce

1131
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:34,078
and you have a lot less control of it

1132
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:37,318
than you know because that's just ego

1133
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,480
you know either that or it's really

1134
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,239
expert breeding

1135
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,740
all right really anal retentive people

1136
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,338
like I just

1137
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:46,338
I mean

1138
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,179
you would think like so when we did the

1139
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,838
F1 cross

1140
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:57,419
you know with Matt to the chem dog right

1141
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,519
and then we grew out so many thousands

1142
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,200
of these seeds

1143
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,800
you would have thought that some would

1144
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,179
have like really been dog-like yeah they

1145
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,339
just weren't

1146
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:09,899
you know so you would think like you

1147
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:12,599
know when you when you do that first

1148
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,240
cross you get the most diversity and now

1149
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:19,140
you just gotta do the hunt

1150
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,779
but the the skunk was so dominant

1151
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:22,980
that

1152
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,680
you know

1153
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,300
there was traces of it you know like

1154
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,500
yeah it felt like it doesn't

1155
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,318
yeah yeah of course

1156
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,059
[Music]

1157
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:35,699
dogweed

1158
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:37,078
you know the other thing the other thing

1159
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:40,078
I think we should mention because like

1160
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:43,079
the game is flipped now go ahead no go

1161
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,660
ahead uh is that when Gabby and I were

1162
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,000
doing all this all the feminized

1163
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:50,940
reversals and stuff like that were still

1164
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,059
years away we kind of thought that like

1165
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,980
at times that like hermaphrodism and

1166
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:59,338
like accidental pollinations we're gonna

1167
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,619
lead you down the wrong path all the

1168
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:04,019
stuff that we did was with regular males

1169
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:07,559
and so you had to create hybrids and

1170
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:10,679
then and back cross and all that and you

1171
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:13,739
know we had to grow out the seeds to see

1172
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:15,960
if what we did did what we wanted

1173
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:18,239
there was no idea that we could take two

1174
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,179
females and reverse one of them and add

1175
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,739
this it was all regular well we knew we

1176
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:25,919
could do it but it would never consider

1177
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:27,598
it exactly already selling seeds by that

1178
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,079
time feminized it's just we are

1179
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,940
delighted we thought that hermaphrodism

1180
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,859
and seeds from hermaphrodism were

1181
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,920
hermaphroditism

1182
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:41,759
because you were going to infect your

1183
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:44,579
line with more traits that were bad

1184
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,900
and you know and and that was just kind

1185
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:47,339
of like I don't know in the not late

1186
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,818
that in the early two thought like that

1187
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:52,460
was just the the Common Thread then

1188
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:55,019
um

1189
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:58,380
I was talking to Matthew about this the

1190
00:47:55,019 --> 00:48:00,059
other day like to me like

1191
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,059
it's

1192
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:05,239
you know it's weird it does it seems

1193
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:08,219
like it's very common

1194
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:10,199
I know it's common I know it's oh and I

1195
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,219
know it's commonly done but I still feel

1196
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:13,799
like

1197
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:16,259
doing this has to pose some type of risk

1198
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,760
no I mean it's common for people to feel

1199
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,680
like you do

1200
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,359
what do you think we're wrong

1201
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,559
yes I think I think you're totally wrong

1202
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,019
but but

1203
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,559
to an extent this is proven by genetics

1204
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,300
like by genetic mapping yeah yeah yeah I

1205
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,619
mean maybe it's just hard for males to

1206
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,160
accept it like we might become

1207
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,160
irrelevant

1208
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:39,239
I mean it's it's actually normal except

1209
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,280
that I would accept that more than the

1210
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:43,439
cannabis plant now it's it's like it's

1211
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,900
normal cannabis plant male is the most

1212
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,539
unappreciated plant on the planet I

1213
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:51,660
agree now we've gone now we've gone to a

1214
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:53,818
point where regular seeds are you know

1215
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:56,699
unicorns almost in the Cannabis world

1216
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:59,400
and almost everything is feminized

1217
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:01,559
reversals of some fashion yeah you know

1218
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,420
uh when Gabby and I were doing it like

1219
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,578
you know the only feminized seeds we

1220
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:09,300
knew of were

1221
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:12,140
um uh you know accidents

1222
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,140
essentially

1223
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,179
yeah I mean yes 100 I'd never heard of

1224
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,578
reversals I'd never heard the only

1225
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:23,159
reversals we had ever heard of then was

1226
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:25,099
like you stressed the hell out of the

1227
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:27,420
plant too

1228
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:29,519
hermaphrodite itself you put it in a

1229
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,579
small container you gave it drought you

1230
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,259
messed with the light sky cycle until it

1231
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:36,900
freaked out and did some weird stuff

1232
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,619
there was nothing there was no sprays we

1233
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:43,139
ever thought about trying to like induce

1234
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:46,019
anything it was like you basically like

1235
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:48,299
tortured the plant until it did what you

1236
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:50,639
wanted yeah that was the tech that we

1237
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:54,680
knew of back then I think

1238
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,679
and it just seemed like the wrong path

1239
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,679
yeah like I said it's very common for

1240
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,480
people from your era to still have that

1241
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:04,739
that mindset everybody we've talked to

1242
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:08,280
on here from your exact era all have

1243
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:13,019
that same opinion still to this day and

1244
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,019
it's like you know and I mean like

1245
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,940
say that you're old when you think you

1246
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:20,519
know everything

1247
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:23,338
and so I'm glad that like I'm not

1248
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:26,159
confident about this and that every day

1249
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:28,739
my opinion might be going more towards

1250
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,739
towards yours Matt

1251
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:33,118
um like in a conversation we had

1252
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:36,358
um

1253
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,940
I feel like selfing could be more

1254
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:42,598
problematic or it seems like it you know

1255
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:45,420
could have more potential for problems

1256
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:47,940
but um so one thing like we're talking

1257
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,280
about Colin from ethos

1258
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,760
like he said something and it seems so

1259
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,800
obvious it's like how can I go my whole

1260
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,280
life and not think of this

1261
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,619
but when you cross two females

1262
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,319
you have a so much better idea of what

1263
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:08,180
you're gonna get oh for sure and like

1264
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:12,480
trying to judge trying to judge what

1265
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:14,639
male was the right one to use

1266
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,240
it's like

1267
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,299
I don't you know you have to

1268
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:22,979
be very very Adept or very very

1269
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,720
repetitive yeah

1270
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,240
you have to do things over and over

1271
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,239
again you know and then do a lot of

1272
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,578
testing which is almost impossible to do

1273
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,338
yeah like how does one grow out

1274
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:38,099
thousands of seeds and preserve every

1275
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:41,219
single clone of every one trying smoking

1276
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:42,420
every female yeah yeah I mean we would

1277
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:44,459
do

1278
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,838
Gabby and I would do this thing where we

1279
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,300
settled kind of like when we were doing

1280
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:50,099
the super dog stuff is like I think we

1281
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,339
picked out like our seven or eight

1282
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:55,440
favorite males based on like looks and

1283
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:57,779
certain traits and then we put them all

1284
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,059
in the room not so usually like the ones

1285
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,160
with the cute butt cheeks yeah we put

1286
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,720
them all in the room and then you know

1287
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,000
they get to a certain point like you

1288
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,159
beat them with a with a you know a

1289
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,780
bamboo steak or something like that and

1290
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,399
all the fans are on and you just like

1291
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,140
the pollen would just spread everywhere

1292
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,700
and we were like well it's gonna make

1293
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:16,500
the hunt harder

1294
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:18,299
but since we don't know which male is

1295
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,780
doing the right I wanted to find was the

1296
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:24,119
one we wanted to just find the one and

1297
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,040
we wanted maximum diversity

1298
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,619
and that's how that's how you're going

1299
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:30,300
to get it trying to be so arrogant that

1300
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:33,900
like you can pick it

1301
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:38,300
that wasn't us you know so like having

1302
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,300
having three or four males in there

1303
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,880
it was a big yeah of yeah finding that

1304
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:47,159
needle needle in the haystack

1305
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,800
but the way we possessed it when we gave

1306
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:52,199
them to see they're all going to be good

1307
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,960
you know they're two phenomenal plants

1308
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:57,419
crossed together it's just like they're

1309
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,800
all gonna be good but you know

1310
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,940
you've got to grow a bunch of them and

1311
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,059
you're going to find

1312
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,280
you know a few that are super amazing

1313
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:08,220
yeah

1314
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,200
do you remember Gabby the one of the

1315
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:12,239
final one of the final breedings we did

1316
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,799
like I was trying to I was racking my

1317
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,299
brain for their names and their names

1318
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,000
really aren't important I guess but you

1319
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,880
had these buddies of yours and they gave

1320
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,079
us a version of the black domino and

1321
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,079
they gave us that Warlock

1322
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,919
um and that those two things because we

1323
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,619
did this we when we did the like the one

1324
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,300
of the final super dog greetings we

1325
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:35,280
basically put these like I don't know

1326
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,859
seven or eight different males that we

1327
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,380
had picked in there with all of the

1328
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:42,779
super dog females that we liked and then

1329
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,480
literally like every good cut that we

1330
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,099
could get access to so we had the dog

1331
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,699
and we had the super skunk and we had

1332
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:52,559
the and we had the you know the Mendo p

1333
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:55,439
and we had the Warlock and we had the

1334
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,540
black domino and we had I'm got I mean

1335
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,300
like literally every good female cut

1336
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:02,759
that him or I had we kind of gathered

1337
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,500
them all up and we put them in there

1338
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,359
so if you found the one you didn't care

1339
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,920
what made the one you just needed to

1340
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,739
find the one

1341
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,260
yeah knowing what it was knowing what it

1342
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:15,659
was would have been helpful to to try to

1343
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,400
do more things like that but like for

1344
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:18,899
instance I don't remember who gave me

1345
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,480
the black domino

1346
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,200
but I remember the reason why we bought

1347
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,539
it

1348
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:27,480
was and I think that was like from

1349
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:30,300
Scentsy seed or yeah we purchased seed

1350
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,300
from from some Seed Company the

1351
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:37,680
description said extremely spider mite

1352
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:39,780
resistant ah yeah you know so the weed

1353
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:42,358
is garbage it really wasn't that good

1354
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,579
but if we could make our weed more like

1355
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:47,279
you know we could cross it with a you

1356
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:49,740
know not so dog and get a plant that was

1357
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,680
good quality and Spiderman resistant

1358
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:54,539
yeah that was a good thing yeah you know

1359
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:56,159
so that's why that that's why that one

1360
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:58,380
was in there what was the other one that

1361
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,078
you mentioned the remember the Warlock

1362
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:03,420
they both came from the same people

1363
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,700
I can't remember who gave me that yeah

1364
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,858
but I remember the weave yeah they were

1365
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:10,558
they were your buddies neither no yeah

1366
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:12,480
neither was that good

1367
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,760
yeah if you're comparing to chem dog I'd

1368
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,338
imagine not I mean the funny thing is

1369
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,460
like there's things where I felt exactly

1370
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:22,619
how Gabby felt and then years later I

1371
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,960
was like man I was just like discounting

1372
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,640
too many things because they weren't

1373
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,800
like my favorite doesn't mean they

1374
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,379
weren't valuable it just means that like

1375
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,960
they weren't my top couple you know and

1376
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,079
as I got older I appreciated different

1377
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,760
qualities of weed you know where in the

1378
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,380
beginning it was kind of like

1379
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,359
I don't know you know you wanted that

1380
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,920
weed that tasted amazing and like hit

1381
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,799
you across the head with a two by four

1382
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,358
yeah in a way

1383
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,160
you know

1384
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:52,259
I wanted to cover sour a little bit more

1385
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:54,179
uh we talked a little bit about how you

1386
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,500
met klopp well what were some of your

1387
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:57,500
impressions of sour

1388
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,500
actually I didn't have

1389
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:07,019
many till much later on

1390
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:10,079
when was your first experience I mean

1391
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:11,639
and we used to grow a lot of it

1392
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,280
you know

1393
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:17,759
um I don't remember exactly what it was

1394
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:21,839
it was one of the deal with it was

1395
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,280
it was a highly productive strain of

1396
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:27,239
beautiful weed

1397
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,220
that we could sell easily yeah and

1398
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:32,399
you know

1399
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:35,338
I was I was on the Discord

1400
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,099
and somebody had to remind me or tell me

1401
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:41,639
that most of the people in the Discord

1402
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:45,480
are really small Growers like yeah they

1403
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:47,578
grow in a tent and it's for personal use

1404
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:51,000
and you know

1405
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:54,300
there's a big difference between that

1406
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,500
and even somebody that grows in his

1407
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,960
garage

1408
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:02,159
you know has a 10 lighter in his garage

1409
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:05,039
okay now you do need to make some money

1410
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,659
to pay for your expenses and the whole

1411
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,579
reason why you put up 10 lights in your

1412
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:10,920
garage was to make a little money in the

1413
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:12,780
first place exactly so

1414
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,980
you have to you have to do what's

1415
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,500
marketable

1416
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,940
and that's part of the reason why we

1417
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,858
gave up on the chem dog in the first

1418
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,780
place

1419
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:24,719
yeah well you know when you're getting

1420
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:27,720
such a terrible yield

1421
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,818
you know off of this plant like we

1422
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:32,699
couldn't justify like we'd have to sell

1423
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:33,599
it for 50 to 100 more than we would this

1424
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,639
hour

1425
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,960
you know we weren't getting that much

1426
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:40,078
more for it

1427
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,400
you know so like we would keep it and

1428
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,700
we'd grow a little bit for our head

1429
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,039
stash and like Francis said you know

1430
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:48,779
somebody was growing it and we would all

1431
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,699
you know share a little bit of it the

1432
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,220
[ __ ] would never get sold because we're

1433
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:56,098
growing such a small amount of it that

1434
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:57,419
you know it didn't make it to the to the

1435
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:00,500
marketplace

1436
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,500
so and

1437
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,760
you know

1438
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:08,219
I wanna I wanna publicly say this

1439
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,880
sure I love cannabis

1440
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:14,098
should I say that louder I love cannabis

1441
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,420
I want to make a living working in

1442
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,119
cannabis

1443
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,619
and to do that it's like a total

1444
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:23,338
different thing

1445
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:25,559
than when you're just trying to grow for

1446
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:28,199
yourself whether it's in your backyard

1447
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:31,800
or in your tents

1448
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:33,779
you know it is if if I was growing just

1449
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,119
for myself

1450
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,819
I would just grow oh Jeeves

1451
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,640
that's really what I like to smoke yeah

1452
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:44,880
you know whether it's the chem dog or

1453
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:47,519
you know other really nice ogs that's

1454
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,619
really the palette that I like

1455
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,400
yeah you know and actually I should say

1456
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:52,798
this

1457
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,500
police want to have a diversity

1458
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:58,500
but then there's that always the staple

1459
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,960
that I go to every morning but then I'll

1460
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,679
mix in some other stuff like I love

1461
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:08,039
sativa Terps I love Citrus turps you

1462
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:10,379
know you know I love to have a variety

1463
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:14,338
you know so I as I was telling you guys

1464
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:18,900
I smoke these um soft spots yeah and I

1465
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:22,139
have like 30 different types of terpenes

1466
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:24,780
some of them are so aggressive that it's

1467
00:59:22,139 --> 00:59:28,019
shocking like you smoke them it's almost

1468
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:32,339
offensive like it's too much I bet but

1469
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:35,280
it's still awesome you know and um so

1470
00:59:32,338 --> 00:59:39,900
but still I I still always lean towards

1471
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,298
the oh geez is what I like now right now

1472
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,760
in California in the commercial

1473
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:45,358
Marketplace

1474
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,760
um

1475
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,460
it's hard to sell a lot of OG

1476
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,099
wow you know and

1477
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,139
it's a first in the

1478
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:57,420
um

1479
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:59,039
that's been going on for a minute you

1480
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,079
know and I think you know you know like

1481
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:02,099
so in the Discord people are hating on

1482
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:05,039
gelato

1483
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:08,760
right oh yeah yeah but [ __ ] that's what

1484
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:10,259
that's what that's what big farms on a

1485
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,079
buy right now

1486
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,220
you know like they're missing the market

1487
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,599
lots of gelato

1488
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:18,419
yeah

1489
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,920
yeah but so let me tell you a mistake

1490
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,119
that I made

1491
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,480
okay

1492
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,000
having a new Nursery right and I have

1493
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,358
all these genetics that are super

1494
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,119
awesome but nobody knows anything about

1495
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:34,199
yeah and so you try to sell people on

1496
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,358
this stuff

1497
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,759
but with today's market they need to

1498
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:42,598
know that they're getting a home run

1499
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:45,240
yeah and so it's so hard to get them to

1500
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,760
try something new

1501
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:49,318
you know when right now they can sell

1502
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,799
all the Lemon Cherry gelato they can

1503
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:54,480
Grill exactly yeah so after so like when

1504
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,159
when I started this I didn't have the

1505
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,838
Lemon Cherry gelato I was like by the

1506
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:01,019
time I get this thing in mass production

1507
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:05,099
it's gonna be like the um

1508
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:06,599
ice cream cake or yeah yeah or you know

1509
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:07,318
like nobody's gonna want this weed

1510
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:10,380
anymore

1511
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:13,019
yeah you know and so but like it's

1512
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:16,619
managed to have lasting power as far as

1513
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:20,039
the demand for the flower and the Clones

1514
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:22,380
so if you're growing a pen lighter

1515
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,659
in your garage

1516
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:27,119
you're really better off you know

1517
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:28,920
growing something that people want

1518
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,780
you know and then maybe a small section

1519
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,780
of it for your own personal

1520
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,579
which is what Francis and I did yeah you

1521
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,859
know we we always do a little bit of a

1522
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:39,780
chem dog but like we had to go to a

1523
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:42,719
strain that was more productive

1524
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:44,700
and that people wanted to buy it

1525
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,019
you know the funny thing about the term

1526
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:47,098
the super skunk is the most beautiful

1527
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:49,440
weed

1528
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:51,240
like the chem dog was the best the super

1529
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,760
skunk

1530
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:55,259
like I think that weed is the most

1531
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,480
beautiful weed

1532
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,480
I love the way it looks too yeah

1533
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:05,940
yeah it was green and Frosty and it

1534
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,099
smelled like crazy and it was super

1535
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,858
pungent and it's a kind of Aroma that

1536
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:14,640
like is very universally recognized by

1537
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:18,000
Americans as like crazy smelling

1538
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:19,879
um you know and I also think too that

1539
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,199
like to the point that Gabby was making

1540
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:25,380
it's weird in that

1541
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:27,000
if certain strains don't leak and they

1542
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:30,119
don't get out to a certain amount of

1543
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,119
people then the demand for them can't

1544
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,460
grow which then makes selling it much

1545
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,338
harder because we would try to sell the

1546
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:40,798
chem dog and they would be like ah this

1547
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:42,659
is kind of like some like backseat OG or

1548
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,358
something like if how good could it be

1549
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:47,578
if I don't have access to it yeah and

1550
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,619
since there was only like a few garages

1551
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:52,140
or something like that in our Greenhouse

1552
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:56,280
or two that was trying to grow some it

1553
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:58,798
was like Brokers want to buy a home run

1554
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,019
and to them that wasn't a home run and

1555
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,818
it was before the Forum Fame and it was

1556
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:05,579
before it got like a really big name for

1557
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:07,019
itself in public and so people just

1558
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:09,480
wanted things that was going to be

1559
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:12,619
something easy for them to flip

1560
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,619
there's always a device

1561
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,639
I mean the I was just gonna say that a

1562
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,139
lot of especially in Mendo you know in

1563
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:22,679
Humboldt and stuff like that a lot of

1564
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:24,659
times what broker what Growers grew what

1565
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:26,298
was what they heard the Brokers wanted

1566
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:29,818
and was easy

1567
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:31,318
so there was a few years there like for

1568
01:03:29,818 --> 01:03:32,818
instance if we wanted to go back and

1569
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:36,058
talk about

1570
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:38,639
um like uh you know Gabby's store like

1571
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:40,680
every Big indoor grower in Mendocino

1572
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:43,500
County was growing some kind of purple

1573
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:46,440
Urkel or granddaddy purps or something

1574
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,838
like that right you remember how many

1575
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,480
Laytonville indoor gardeners Gabby were

1576
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:54,298
growing miracle and Urkel

1577
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:58,380
because it was easy and the BR and

1578
01:03:54,298 --> 01:04:00,539
Urkel yeah granddaddy perks you know all

1579
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,400
those type of things and and then the

1580
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,358
market shifted and it went to sour and

1581
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,338
Kush

1582
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,019
and all those Growers dropped the

1583
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:08,940
purples and went right into what the

1584
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:10,980
Brokers wanted

1585
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,780
and so there's a you know there's a lot

1586
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,420
there where it's like you might end up

1587
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,798
liking a strain but you end up growing a

1588
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,838
small amount of it for you and your

1589
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,159
friends and a lot of times you end up

1590
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:22,380
growing what

1591
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:25,078
the you know the majority of what you

1592
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:27,240
grow is what you think the Brokers or

1593
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:28,859
the market wants to absorb relatively

1594
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:32,699
easily

1595
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:34,380
so here's my new strategy

1596
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:38,298
I want to have

1597
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:41,539
30 percent of exclusive stuff

1598
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:44,579
that you know I'm bringing to the market

1599
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:46,259
you know one way or another I want to

1600
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:48,660
have 30 percent

1601
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:52,859
of you know

1602
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:55,440
up and coming from known people

1603
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:59,818
and then 30 percent well that only ends

1604
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:01,798
up to 90 so 33 of each 33 of stuff that

1605
01:04:59,818 --> 01:05:05,279
people want right now

1606
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:07,338
you know that way I can

1607
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,798
I can sell people what they want now

1608
01:05:07,338 --> 01:05:13,858
while creating a demand for products

1609
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,659
under my brand as well as Partnerships

1610
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:17,940
with existing brands

1611
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:21,118
you know but thinking I could do it all

1612
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:23,880
with like exclusive stuff that nobody

1613
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:26,579
knows anything about even though like

1614
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,380
it's Fireweed that won the emerald cup

1615
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:30,660
and it's like

1616
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:34,260
that that takes a little bit more today

1617
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:37,920
than it uses it takes a lot it takes a

1618
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,720
lot yeah and a lot of legal a lot of

1619
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,680
legal Farms they're sort of drowning

1620
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:46,259
under upfront fees and costs and taxes

1621
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,419
and operating expenses so they real

1622
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,680
their margins are a lot of times quite

1623
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,780
tight

1624
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,298
um so they really want home runs because

1625
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:56,880
they're worried about survival

1626
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:58,920
you know um it's not for at least

1627
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,559
especially for you know for most people

1628
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,720
it's not a particularly lucrative time

1629
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,819
in cannabis

1630
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:07,919
it's kind of more of like a stay afloat

1631
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:10,739
time

1632
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,480
and the the more it's like that the more

1633
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:15,179
people want certainty

1634
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:18,358
and so that leads to sameness because

1635
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:19,919
people want it hurts the quality it

1636
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:21,239
hurts quality and it hurts diversity

1637
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,000
because people are just trying to

1638
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:25,139
produce an already popular thing at a

1639
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,838
low cost

1640
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:30,239
and get somebody to buy it

1641
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:33,599
and it's risky like he was just saying

1642
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:35,279
to try to promote fire that you

1643
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,099
personally think is amazing

1644
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,859
but the market might not think that yet

1645
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:43,200
and so do you have the capacity to like

1646
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:44,219
convince them or are you just gonna sit

1647
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,858
on it

1648
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:49,078
it's different than when your Market was

1649
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:51,960
you were showing your friends your weed

1650
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:55,920
and smoking some with them and you know

1651
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:58,920
then it was easier now it's like selling

1652
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,139
it in bulk to whether it's a distributor

1653
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,519
or a broker

1654
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:04,199
you know

1655
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:07,259
everybody

1656
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:09,358
it's too far from the final person for

1657
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:13,200
people to be taking these risks

1658
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:16,619
and so they're just pumping the gelatos

1659
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:19,139
you know and realistically like

1660
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:22,140
today I think in California

1661
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:25,379
most commercial Farms they have some

1662
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:27,719
type of gelato in their rotation

1663
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:30,900
you know because

1664
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:34,078
the market is calling for it you know

1665
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:36,180
and the consumer the consumer

1666
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:38,460
I don't want to call them idiots but

1667
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:41,460
they're uneducated

1668
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,980
that's the best word for it well it's

1669
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:46,440
also to be fair to them Gabby it's also

1670
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:49,380
hard to make new decisions when you walk

1671
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,420
into a legal store and everything that

1672
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:54,660
you want to check out is in a sealed

1673
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:56,579
opaque mylar that they can't touch it

1674
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:58,858
smell it smoke it or get excited about

1675
01:07:56,579 --> 01:08:00,480
it they just have to like spend a bunch

1676
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:02,460
of money on it and then hope when they

1677
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,740
open it up it's something good

1678
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:06,900
and a lot of the way these mylars are

1679
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:08,759
designed you don't even see the Cannabis

1680
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,318
inside it until you've walked out of the

1681
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,140
store and purchased it

1682
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:15,420
they just look at what percentage THC it

1683
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:16,738
is whatever it has the most they take

1684
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,020
that

1685
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:21,358
that's what they've been told and then

1686
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:23,640
even if a farmer even if a farmer wants

1687
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:26,160
to take risks it's not just on the

1688
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,560
farmer the distro and the dispensary

1689
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:31,318
also has to be willing to promote that

1690
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,420
to the customer

1691
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:35,580
so the farmer often time doesn't even

1692
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,899
have control over whether or not the

1693
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:40,019
customer is going to get educated

1694
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:42,599
properly on why they think it's so good

1695
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:44,460
yeah I really really try our best to

1696
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:47,279
reach out to Bud tenders with this show

1697
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:50,279
as as crazy as it sounds like they're

1698
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,020
the the the last point before the

1699
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:54,779
customers and we want them to be at

1700
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:56,819
least be the most educated out of the

1701
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:59,580
whole ring because they're the ones who

1702
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:01,859
interact the most with the customers

1703
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:04,500
you know you know what I was I was

1704
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:07,920
remembering Gabby and uh I don't know

1705
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:10,560
this is a totally random story but

1706
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,420
Gabby and I did a project together where

1707
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,620
we built this greenhouse on a property

1708
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:15,838
he had

1709
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:17,880
and we we thought it was get we thought

1710
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,880
it was a huge Greenhouse at the time but

1711
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:23,640
now it's like laughably small

1712
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:26,279
um but do you remember when we grew uh

1713
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,140
the Maui dude and those buds were so big

1714
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:29,819
we took those pictures where your head

1715
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:31,859
was behind the cola and all you could

1716
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:33,420
see was your ponytail and like your ears

1717
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:35,900
sticking out because there was these

1718
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,899
giant

1719
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:42,059
the classic High Time submission photo

1720
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:44,159
yeah right yeah you know that that's

1721
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,020
what you know we've seen icons is like a

1722
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:48,539
butt in front of their face because you

1723
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:51,420
know we have these giant we you know we

1724
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:52,979
grew I I mean we had Urkel and Maui and

1725
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,480
Superdog and various things in there

1726
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:56,159
those things probably burned in your

1727
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:57,238
fire but at some point we had all these

1728
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,800
pictures

1729
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:01,259
and that's hard too because I was

1730
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,739
thinking about it and it's like before

1731
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:07,260
phones had cameras on them there was so

1732
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:09,359
many less pictures taken there was so

1733
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,820
many less you know

1734
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,759
um Gabby had some nice cameras and so we

1735
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:16,559
took some really cool photos of various

1736
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,900
things that we were doing

1737
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,580
um but all it took was a fire or a bust

1738
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:23,158
or an accident or something like that

1739
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:24,539
and all that history would be lost

1740
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:26,339
you know

1741
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:28,800
yeah we got yeah I always remember that

1742
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,840
I always remember that like of Gabby's

1743
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,219
head Behind These Maui Buds and all you

1744
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,199
could see was like he used to have this

1745
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,939
really long ponytail and you all you

1746
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:37,979
could see was a part of the ponytail and

1747
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:40,738
maybe the corner of one ear because the

1748
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:41,819
bud was like you know because it was a

1749
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:44,459
[ __ ] big

1750
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:46,319
yeah

1751
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,359
but I mean it was pretty risque I mean

1752
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:50,279
like you know I think like we started on

1753
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:53,219
it the greenhouse was going to be 20 by

1754
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:56,579
50. and Gabby thought that was enormous

1755
01:10:53,219 --> 01:11:00,899
so we shrank it to 20 by 30 and he was

1756
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:03,420
it still seemed like it was ballsy

1757
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:07,759
you know it was on the very top it was

1758
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,760
on the top of the hill in an open field

1759
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:12,238
and you know a few years later that kind

1760
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:14,939
of stuff was a little bit more the norm

1761
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:16,619
but at the time it was coming out of the

1762
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:18,119
tree lines and it was coming out of the

1763
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:21,599
indoors and it was coming out of these

1764
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:24,599
tiny little scenes and it seemed Giant

1765
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:27,000
it seemed giant oh yeah for sure

1766
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:30,060
you know in that regard

1767
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,500
and uh you know even the idea that you

1768
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,320
could put something like he just said in

1769
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,000
like an open field

1770
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:37,920
and you wouldn't get in trouble

1771
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,140
yeah you could actually get away with it

1772
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,000
that always blew my mind about up there

1773
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,440
in the Emerald Triangle that anybody

1774
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,719
could do that because like you could you

1775
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:46,559
cannot do that here still there's no way

1776
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:48,840
well

1777
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,400
it's it's it was always a game a cat and

1778
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,260
mouse

1779
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:55,979
huh

1780
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:59,340
like our thinking on it was so there was

1781
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:01,678
like a generally like well-known or

1782
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:03,960
maybe it was wrong but we always thought

1783
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:08,279
like as long as you have under a hundred

1784
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:09,480
plants then it becomes the like the feds

1785
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:12,179
aren't going to want to deal with this

1786
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:14,698
and the local cops they're dealing with

1787
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:16,980
much bigger people so

1788
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:19,139
with the greenhouse

1789
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:20,759
they could never actually and actually

1790
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,820
you're allowed to medically have 25

1791
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,739
plants at this time you know so with the

1792
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:27,380
greenhouse it was like you can't really

1793
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:30,119
see what's in there

1794
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,560
you know and so if you can't see what's

1795
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:33,179
in there

1796
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,760
then

1797
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:37,140
you know we felt a little safer maybe it

1798
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,260
was just you know we were kidding

1799
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,280
ourselves even though you could smell it

1800
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,840
yeah but you can't smell it from a

1801
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,859
helicopter and if you could you wouldn't

1802
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,779
know what you're smelling because

1803
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,179
everyone was growing up there I mean it

1804
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:50,939
was a remote the whole idea was just

1805
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:54,840
like Point keep it keep it kind of small

1806
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:56,639
and make it not worth the trouble of

1807
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,100
that now the issue that we never thought

1808
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,140
of is we had a perfect landing pad over

1809
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:04,020
there they could have like random 10

1810
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:06,119
helicopters up there oh no right so it

1811
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,580
wasn't like the Shady like a sketchy

1812
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:10,619
Mountainside terrain like they have no

1813
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:13,319
place to put it was not like they had

1814
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,779
like a flat mode off [ __ ] landing pad

1815
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:18,299
over there

1816
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:19,979
it would have been bad I mean yeah I'll

1817
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,179
bring this up just because I I just

1818
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,738
thought of it but like when we were

1819
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:24,539
growing the skunk

1820
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:25,919
you know like that spot we were just

1821
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:27,359
talking about was remote enough it

1822
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,158
really didn't have neighbors that you

1823
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,019
were too worried about but when we were

1824
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:33,719
growing the skunk inside it was kind of

1825
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:36,239
before the carbon filter era it was more

1826
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:39,060
like where you had like uh you know the

1827
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:41,639
uov Nair like the the ozone generators

1828
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,820
and stuff and you'd grow that skunk and

1829
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,560
like two weeks before it was done you'd

1830
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:49,619
pull up into your driveway with your

1831
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,679
windows down and you'd be like oh my God

1832
01:13:49,619 --> 01:13:54,359
it smells for 50 yards in every

1833
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:57,420
direction around my house like I'm

1834
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:58,319
slaughtering skunks like I'm gonna get

1835
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:02,100
in trouble

1836
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,779
oh my God it reeks and we used to do all

1837
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,340
these things like Caulking and like

1838
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:07,859
venting and trying to do all this

1839
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:11,039
different stuff and it just beat every

1840
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:12,839
effort we had to try to contain the

1841
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:15,479
smell it was uncontainable and so in

1842
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:19,739
some people would get rid of it because

1843
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:22,738
it was too fragrant it like caused panic

1844
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:22,738
like

1845
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:30,179
the skunk

1846
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:32,698
ah there you go so it was the skunk

1847
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:34,760
yeah correct Francis yeah this is what

1848
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:36,960
you're talking about reaped

1849
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,699
than anybody else

1850
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,439
he knows that he knows it might have

1851
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:42,539
been super skunk or skunk

1852
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:44,879
I mean the thing about it is for me is

1853
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:47,819
that I always thought Gabby that like

1854
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,619
you know that you know you get when I

1855
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:51,359
when I when you gave me clones it was

1856
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:53,460
like you gave me the dog and you gave me

1857
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,738
and you gave me skunk

1858
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,198
and just by your story I've been

1859
01:14:55,738 --> 01:15:01,559
thinking about this too

1860
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:03,839
okay and I you know and I know how

1861
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,940
important this is to so many people

1862
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,219
so I don't want to get it wrong

1863
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:11,759
right yeah but

1864
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:14,460
I explicitly remember getting the skunk

1865
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,960
from the dude in Virginia

1866
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:18,719
right

1867
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,840
and that that plant isn't the one that

1868
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:23,880
looks just like the uh

1869
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,179
the Scentsy Seed Catalog

1870
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:30,359
and we had gotten we had gotten the

1871
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:34,140
seeds from Scentsy and that's how we got

1872
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:36,420
our original cross that we were uh that

1873
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,460
you know then we got the mails from to

1874
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:41,100
to make everything else

1875
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:43,319
like super dog and that stuff so that so

1876
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:46,560
that so that's the way I remember it but

1877
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:48,119
as such an important part of History you

1878
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,380
know yeah I'm not signing in no but

1879
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:51,300
that's David's or anything like that

1880
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,980
yeah exactly but that's I mean that's

1881
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,900
all anyone wants you know what I mean

1882
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,119
like if you don't quite have an answer

1883
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:59,879
it's best guess

1884
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:02,099
that's the best guess that's that that's

1885
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,420
just that's more advanced than we were

1886
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:06,179
before

1887
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,739
yeah and I I mean you believe that I

1888
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:09,719
will repeat the same story the next time

1889
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:11,218
I speak to you like you said that

1890
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:12,359
somebody was telling the story and every

1891
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:14,460
time they told it it was a little bit

1892
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:17,158
different I don't think I'm gonna tell

1893
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:19,198
it differently no no no no no this is

1894
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:22,319
this is a lot different thing I'm also

1895
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:23,939
not swearing to accuracy you know no of

1896
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:27,380
course I smoke a lot I promise it's a

1897
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:27,379
it's a it's a long-ass time

1898
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:34,738
it's literally decades ago yeah

1899
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:38,879
so yeah let me ask yourself the question

1900
01:16:34,738 --> 01:16:41,819
Francis didn't we get the seeds in order

1901
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:45,179
to make the first cross

1902
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:46,799
yeah here's the thing is that when we

1903
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:50,940
were talking earlier you were like oh we

1904
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:53,219
just used the males right but we had

1905
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:55,979
that problem from the Census

1906
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:59,039
but we had that one female

1907
01:16:55,979 --> 01:17:02,039
right that you that like that you gave

1908
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:04,260
me so I don't know how that one female

1909
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:06,779
came to be because by the time that I

1910
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:12,140
came into it like you gave me the skunk

1911
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:12,139
you gave me skunk and dog the same day

1912
01:17:12,738 --> 01:17:19,319
you don't have it anymore correct

1913
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,820
I lost it when I got in trouble and you

1914
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:23,039
know whatever that was does anyone give

1915
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:26,219
a [ __ ] it's a gun

1916
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:28,979
because because one of them one of them

1917
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:32,100
is probably in sour and one of them is

1918
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:35,218
probably in chem dog D and Diesel and

1919
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:36,539
they're very important I think so I

1920
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:39,239
think that's true

1921
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:42,539
but I mean if we don't have it then like

1922
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:44,698
but we have the we have the last two and

1923
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:46,920
we would like to know

1924
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:49,319
kind of which one went where because

1925
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,000
people don't believe us on that on that

1926
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:53,099
little part of it like that's what I

1927
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,460
believed I don't know I don't so what

1928
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:58,560
part is not believed that uh like the

1929
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:01,679
chem dog D it would would have the same

1930
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:05,940
Super Skunk chem 91 connection

1931
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:07,679
okay they still think it's sisters

1932
01:18:05,939 --> 01:18:10,439
they don't believe us

1933
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,600
yes we disagree with them

1934
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:14,579
probably neither of us will ever be

1935
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,520
proven right or wrong

1936
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:20,579
and we can just enjoy this debate for

1937
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,860
the rest of our life yeah I mean I mean

1938
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:25,500
like you don't have I do Source we don't

1939
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:28,259
have the source material Beyond people's

1940
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:30,300
words that's true you know to do it

1941
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,159
right like we need to have all the

1942
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:35,539
genetics Maybe

1943
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:37,738
right if we had all the genetics and

1944
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:40,380
futuristic technology

1945
01:18:37,738 --> 01:18:43,099
right but we we already don't have all

1946
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:46,020
the possible genetics because it's lost

1947
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:48,960
who knows I could I could identify it

1948
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:52,260
from a photo of a bud if somebody was

1949
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:55,560
growing it like the weed is so unique

1950
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:57,659
and it looks just like the [ __ ]

1951
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:00,420
Scentsy Seed Catalog photo

1952
01:18:57,658 --> 01:19:01,799
like it's the only weed that I've ever

1953
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:04,199
grown

1954
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:06,360
that you could do that with yeah I'll

1955
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:09,059
send you I there there are people that

1956
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:10,679
think it's I mean this causes all kinds

1957
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:14,640
of debate because what happens now Gabby

1958
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:17,520
is that people people get get excited

1959
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,560
about old school famous strings and then

1960
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,580
there's opportunists that are like I

1961
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,380
found it

1962
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:23,640
now I'm gonna sell you clones for high

1963
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:25,140
dollar or I'm gonna make a bunch of

1964
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,719
hybrids with seed and you'll be able to

1965
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:29,460
get it in seed form and so there's a

1966
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:31,859
bunch of fakes that proliferate about

1967
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:34,859
various stuff there's all these there's

1968
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:37,859
all this Politics the buyer must be

1969
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:40,439
where they must be where and like and

1970
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:43,019
that's and that's why you buy seeds from

1971
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:45,500
a reliable source like Riot seed go

1972
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,500
right

1973
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:49,679
um because

1974
01:19:47,479 --> 01:19:52,139
if not

1975
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:54,000
it you know like you know the buyer must

1976
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,039
be aware and you know if you're only

1977
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,039
paying you know even a hundred dollars a

1978
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:02,460
pack 150 a pack you know you can roll

1979
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:04,439
the dice when you got situations like

1980
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,760
companies that should be remain unnamed

1981
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:07,738
that are selling packs for a thousand

1982
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,600
bucks or something like that then you

1983
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:12,299
really want to know you're getting

1984
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:15,120
something I I think genetics are worth

1985
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:16,560
that much yeah when you're actually

1986
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,500
getting

1987
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,420
what you're promised if if someone's

1988
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:23,698
saying this is what you're getting this

1989
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,100
is what you can expect this is what you

1990
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:28,379
know I think you know genetics can be

1991
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,000
worth thousands of dollars

1992
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:31,739
um but

1993
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,719
when you're dealing with unreputable

1994
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:34,859
people and the thing about unreputable

1995
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:37,800
people is

1996
01:20:34,859 --> 01:20:39,479
they get called out pretty quick

1997
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,420
you know like the other person we were

1998
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:43,979
talking about before well

1999
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:46,560
what happens you know what happens is

2000
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:49,379
Gabby is is that

2001
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,320
honestly because we don't have genetic

2002
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:54,840
testing and because we don't have the

2003
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:56,639
guaranteed what we have is we have

2004
01:20:54,840 --> 01:21:00,300
stories

2005
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:02,039
right and these stories get you know

2006
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,539
like there's people that are like they

2007
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:04,859
buy into the story and then there's

2008
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:08,279
people that are like that guy's a

2009
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:10,500
scumbag I don't buy his story at all

2010
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:13,079
but Francis if we answer if we answer

2011
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,520
these questions life would be extremely

2012
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:17,640
boring and some people would have no

2013
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:19,679
lives I get it dude that's true you know

2014
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,600
it's just like like what are these

2015
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:24,960
people gonna do when they stop arguing

2016
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,340
dog or or the skunk is right I mean

2017
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,539
there's funny things where like when I

2018
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,400
would tell when I would tell those

2019
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:30,719
stories on previous podcasts there would

2020
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:32,579
be people that would get all mad at me

2021
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,899
and would be like you don't know the

2022
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:35,158
dude that brought him West you were

2023
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:37,859
never really friends with that guy

2024
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:39,479
you're [ __ ] making it up and I'm like

2025
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:40,679

2026
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:42,439

2027
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:44,579

2028
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:45,779

2029
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:49,380
here

2030
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:52,198
you see that nine yeah it's here now

2031
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:54,319
you know I mean I was honestly like even

2032
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:56,460
with that I could help I would rather

2033
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:57,899
you say it again for people that are

2034
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:01,279
just stepping in

2035
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:05,519
what Francis said was pretty accurate

2036
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:07,439
the anything that was inaccurate or not

2037
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,040
completely accurate was maybe some

2038
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:13,919
timelines and Minor Details that really

2039
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:16,800
don't change the story much at all

2040
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,619
you know like the the basis of the story

2041
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:22,199
is the same yeah so

2042
01:22:19,619 --> 01:22:24,179
I mean honestly I think you did a better

2043
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:25,919
job than I would have been able to just

2044
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:27,960
because

2045
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,658
you know you've been thinking about it

2046
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,279
for longer and you know you've you've

2047
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:33,779
spelled it out in your mind and possibly

2048
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:36,420
on paper what you've thought about it

2049
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:39,000
yeah obsesses yeah we're having really

2050
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:41,039
all those stories just come from like a

2051
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,840
million times of like me and Gabby

2052
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,779
sitting on a couch somewhere stoned

2053
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,699
shooting the [ __ ] about wheat yeah

2054
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:50,519
that's where it all came from like it

2055
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:52,859
just friendships sharing stories about

2056
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:56,880
this or that or whatever and like that's

2057
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:58,559
honestly like why I believed Gabby so

2058
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,960
much more than some of the later stuff

2059
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,900
that came up was because he didn't have

2060
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,939
a reason to lie yeah it was way before

2061
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:08,879
the theme it was years and years before

2062
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:12,238
skunk the egg on the forums and anybody

2063
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,760
knew chemdog like the the public hadn't

2064
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,658
heard of it it was just stories amongst

2065
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,880
friends

2066
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:20,219
and he was able to it was always the

2067
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,239
same story no matter how big right you

2068
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:23,819
guys were

2069
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:26,819
yeah it was just us it was just friends

2070
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:29,599
sharing stuff you know and yeah and you

2071
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:32,819
know and Gabby and I had a very similar

2072
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,800
view on weed in the sense that like we

2073
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:37,979
both liked really good weed and we both

2074
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:40,619
wanted to make better weed if we could

2075
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:43,319
you know I almost did I almost didn't

2076
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:46,260
say it dude but like way back in the day

2077
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:47,759
I liked sativas and like Gabby hated

2078
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:50,640
them because he was like dude I'm so

2079

down

2081
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:55,198
he's like maybe you're so calm you can

2082
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:56,819
get like a little anxious or a little

2083
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,460
bit higher he's like I don't want to do

2084
01:23:56,819 --> 01:24:00,960
that dude I need to mellow out like

2085
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:04,579

2089
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:13,319
people were telling me to chill out too

2090
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:15,719
people like Gabby chill the [ __ ] out

2091

I'm gonna have to stop this in a minute

2093
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:19,579
but it's all right we're gonna continue

2094
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,619
again

2095
01:24:19,579 --> 01:24:24,840
is that you know I'll say this is that

2096
01:24:22,619 --> 01:24:27,179
California is a bunch of you know

2097
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:29,940
there's it's a lot Chiller you know

2098
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:33,179
Gabby coming from you know being a New

2099
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:35,279
York Jew coming West he was loud he

2100
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:37,619
talked fast people thought it was

2101
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,319
aggressive but it was like where he came

2102
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:42,300
from everybody talked like that yeah

2103
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:45,238

2104
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:47,340
it was just like you know I it wasn't

2105
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:49,379
anything weird it was just you know

2106
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,179
there's cultural differences you move

2107
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:54,560
from the East Coast or New York to

2108
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:58,079
California it's not culturally the same

2109
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:01,020
when I moved from Chicago to you know to

2110
