minute for him so we will be running the

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:01,600
show without mat um as a I don't know as

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,480
an aside I I I Can Only Imagine that he

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,879
he's not too disappointed to miss

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,840
growing round taes he he's he's

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,519
expressed his indifference before um but

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,240
it's always fun to have him obviously so

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,599
it's sad that we don't get him tonight

31
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:20,000
but that is okay we hope he is doing

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,000
okay um today we welcome back scone

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,359

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,599

00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,759
time we welcome

36
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:31,599
bumat so this show tonight is actually

37
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,920
going to be about organ oranic growing

38
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:38,559
and I wanted to State a qualifier here

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,280
which is that organic Growers maybe

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,079
somewhat ironically tend to be some of

41
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,239
the most tribal dogmatic scary people in

42
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,798
the

43
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:50,158
community we're not here to be you know

44
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,079
the people on this on this panel are not

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,399
here to be authorities they're just here

46
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,599
as Growers sharing their thoughts

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,560
sharing their experience so unclench

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,438
your fists put your knives away

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,799
take your hands off the keyboard and

50
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,158
just try to enjoy the show if your

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,360
opinions differ feel free to comment

52
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,640
later

53
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,160
on okay so maybe since bumat is new to

54
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,639
the show uh I want to invite him to

55
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,840
speak on a couple of things uh one thing

56
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,598
I'll get him to repeat because he told

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,439
us a bit about this before we hit record

58
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,518
is what his recent you know what his

59
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,919
current growing situation is like um and

60
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,719
secondarily uh why he wanted to do the

61
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,199
show in general um

62
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,639
bumat do you w to tell us about what

63
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,399
you've been growing you told us a bit

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,639
about your situation moving just before

65
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,640
tell us

66
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,199
again yeah so I um I just ended up

67
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,799
moving up to the Rockies around 9,000

68
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,719
feet but um the last two years I've been

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,599
growing in an apartment down in the

70
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,639
Denver area um I was growing in a

71
00:02:52,598 --> 00:03:00,280
2x4 uh which a 300 watt light just

72
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:02,598
really small um really confined space to

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,598
uh do my stuff but um now I have a

74
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,439
little bit more space up here but I did

75
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:11,798
just Harvest last May a round of Trinity

76
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,639
Bubba Kush um from twg and I had a five

77
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,280
potential Keepers that moved onto the

78
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,919
second round one of them didn't end up

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,039
cloning so it's down to four now um that

80
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,958
they're going to get moved on to the

81
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,318
second round but yeah and then as for

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,519
the second part uh I want to do this

83
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:31,679
show mainly because I feel like

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,400
it's a because you've said um and many

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,840
others will point out that organic

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,879
Growers are really tribal and it's

87
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,400
really hard to find a good discussion in

88
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,719
my opinion where people can actually be

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,480
fair and not be overly biased to one

90
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,158
side so I kind of wanted to have this

91
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,919
conversation more just on a grounds of

92
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,798
being able to actually talk about these

93
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,158
ideas and share these ideas with others

94
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,879
because I feel like gr organically is

95
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,598
kind of Pitfall and there's a lot of

96
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,399
hard like ways to find information and I

97
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,399
feel like we between the three of us can

98
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,400
really guide some people and help um

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,400
provide some information and helpful

100
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,519
tips yeah absolutely and um thank you so

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,879
much as well for you know initiating all

102
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,358
of this I think you spoke to me about

103
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:20,079
this like a year ago yeah it took us a

104
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,279
little bit to get to this but um I think

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,199
once

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,439
we I think once we knew we could get

107
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,759
screw and Kyle as well I kind of forgot

108
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,160
um that we we had more people I know

109
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,319
that we have more organic grow was by

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
the way it just took me a little bit to

111
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,439
kind of like think of who who might fit

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,919
so yeah appreciate all of you being here

113
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,639
again uh maybe bumat last question for

114
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,680
you is how long have you been growing

115
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,800
and how long have you been growing

116
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,519
organically

117
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,160
for um so I have a little bit of a mixed

118
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,560
career uh I started in Organics and I've

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
grown everything at home has been

120
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,720
Organics but the last two years I've um

121
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,240
almost two years it'll be two in

122
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,240
September but I've worked for um an MSO

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,120
here in

124
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,960
Colorado I'll keep the company name uh

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,038
for later for you guys um but uh yeah

126
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,198
I've actually really enjoyed it and um I

127
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,839
kind of call it's weird I call it um a

128
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,240
mom and pop MSO because the owner is

129
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,959
like an old Forum head who ended up

130
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,840
getting some funding from some friends

131
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,478
and it would he's a really good guy and

132
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,599
really loves and like has a passion for

133
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,120
genetics so it's a lot it's a lot of fun

134
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,879
for me to be able to like bounce ideas

135
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,079
off him and he's been growing for 30

136
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,319
something years but I personally have

137
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,599
been growing since 2019

138
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,560
I don't really like to count that first

139
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,319
year because it was so so horrible we

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,000
can get to that one later um but uh

141
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,000
everything that I've done which first

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,959
two years were outdoor and then I bought

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,399
a tent and really [ __ ] that first

144
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,959
round up as well and then as well and

145
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,560
then I've just kind of slowly learned

146
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,239
everything I could from resources from

147
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,439
build a soil YouTube channel to Jeff

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,840
lenell's teaming with series and um all

149
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,079
sorts of other podcasts uh that I can go

150
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,959
on and on about it later uh but yeah

151
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,519

152

155
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,758

156
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,719

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,680
do different kind kind of styles within

166
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,439
that so you know I just kind of do that

167
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,879
and I've kind of mix it around just

168
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,719
based on what's going on at the time um

169
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,598
since I'm going in the garage my uh

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,160
environment changes so I just kind of

171
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm always kind of doing different stuff

172
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,599
uh right now I have uh see I got some

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:04,879
Santa Cruz wreck uh some blue dream s1's

174
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:07,360
um see what else do I have in there uh I

175
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,120
think that's oh I got some this is a

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,000
black poison from the Rev growing in

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,199
there and that's pretty much it I'm try

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,319
doing uh some reversal stuff um just

179
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,840
kind of playing around doing a whole

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,319
bunch of different things actually

181
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,279
so yeah very nice that's really it not

182
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,240
too much from the last episode really

183
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,679
I'm just same same old same old I just

184
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,879
keep it chugging along

185
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,478
one question I had for you was um how

186
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,479
much how much experience you have with

187
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,680
synthetics uh well I only know from

188
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,598
seeing other grows and that's mostly

189
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,879
from my family uh in meno and they did

190
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,079
uh a lot of Depp and outdoor so mostly

191
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,199
it was mostly a Sanic type of thing they

192
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,478
basically would pick up whatever was at

193
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,319
the grow shop because they've been doing

194
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,800
it so long you know was type of The Grow

195
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,479
shops would hey we have this we have

196
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
that and they would throw it out there

197
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,598
and so basically I know from that and

198
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,399
they always grown really good stuff but

199
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,918
obviously I found out later on you know

200
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,318
when you do that outside it doesn't

201
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,959
really

202
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,439
affect stuff because the decomposition

203
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,478
of so it doesn't really matter what you

204
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,560
put because the decomposition uh it just

205
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,359
kind of gets rid of anything that's bad

206
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,158
because it's outside so the microbes and

207
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,759
stuff are eating away and it so it

208
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,519
doesn't really matter what you put

209
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,520
outside type of thing so it's not really

210
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:30,158
Sanic uh if you I it's kind of hard to

211
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,598
explain I guess um but uh yeah that's

212
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,360
the only thing I don't I've never did

213
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,759
seanic anything so yeah no that's cool

214
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,120
and I'm sure we can get into some of the

215
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,319
details that are on um scen tell us a

216
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,839
bit about what you've been growing

217
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,760
recently and your experience with

218
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:50,279
Organic your setup kind of

219
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:56,958
thing uh yeah um so I just recently

220
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:59,399
harvested a Skyline from H&amp;L and I

221
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,838
harvested a pea Berry and a bubble

222
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,639
bberry V2 from

223
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,480
Matt

224
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,759
um and in my other flowering space I

225
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,680
have garbage cloud from uh from pack

226
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,799
going right

227
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:22,519
now um my setup is I mean it's pretty

228
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:26,159
simple I have one uh 4x4 for my veg and

229
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:29,519
in that I have uh one of those Chrome

230
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:34,919
racks um so I have like three layers to

231
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:38,078
be able to move plants through it um and

232
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,639
then I have two 2x4s for flowering and

233
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:43,679
one 3x3 for

234
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,039
drying simple small space uh but I'm

235
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,439
still able to go through quite a bit of

236
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:51,199
numbers

237
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,200
just um by keeping things like

238
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,800
small yeah yeah and in terms of like the

239
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,000
synthetic organic thing you know in your

240
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,599
experience how much have you how much

241
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,320
time have spent with either

242
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,440
approach

243
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,839
uh so I when I first started trying to

244
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,160
grow I was doing just like you know soil

245
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,959
that I was stealing from around town and

246
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,480
[ __ ] um but like I never harvested

247
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:21,479
anything or you know like other than

248
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,440
some wispy bracks and stuff um and then

249
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,159
when I started like actually you know

250
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,839
buckling down uh when I got back uh back

251
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,759
home in 2011

252
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,279
I went to hydro uh just

253
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,679
because you know I I got a Ed Rosenthal

254
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,519
book and was like [ __ ] it I want to try

255
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,519
flood tables I guess and that's when

256
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,519
like I actually started

257
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,240
cropping um I did that for

258
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,839
till

259
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:58,200
2015 early 2016 and I had to take a

260
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,800
little bit of a break um for a couple

261
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,720
years and when I came back I I wanted to

262
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,958
I wanted to try out organic so I've been

263
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,839
doing doing the whole like quote unquote

264
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:14,159
living soil stuff um for the past four

265
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,160
years

266
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,000
now and yeah I don't know I mean I grow

267
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,000
I I want to preface all of this whole

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,480
episode by like I don't think that

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,078
anyone style has Supremacy in terms of

270
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:37,480
like smoke and all of that um it's more

271
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:40,359
so however you grow best yeah and I am

272
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,320
not a good hydr grower but I am a good

273
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,919
organic grower that's the only reason I

274
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,480
do it it's not because of some weird

275
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:50,159
dogm or anything like that yeah yeah

276
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,200
yeah many of us I think just grow

277
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,480
relative to I don't know AR arbitrary

278
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,000
constraints in our lives right like the

279
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,278
the space that you have the the products

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,720
you have access to at the time like you

281
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,078
know there are lots of

282
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,278
like arbitrary reasons why we grow the

283
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,879
way we do um and I think like I was

284
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,078
saying to you guys before we started

285
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,039
recording I think really the value in

286
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,879
hearing from different people is is

287
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,639
hearing about the different conditions

288
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,399
that they grow under and why things may

289
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,000
or may not work under those conditions

290
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,559
uh rather than just trying to State like

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
you know silver bullets uh like oh yeah

292
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,838
this is just good like an abstraction of

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,759
anything that's never true right with

294
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,320
growing we know that so I think this is

295
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,319
just a broad invitation to to all three

296
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,920
of you to you know think about your

297
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,079
experience think about why things may or

298
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,399
may not have worked and for what reason

299
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,319
um and I think talking

300
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,480
about uh tech tech and strategy in that

301
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,760
way is uh a little bit more um generous

302
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,480
right because we're not just saying oh

303
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,838
we just we do this because it's good or

304
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,759
we do this because it's the best because

305
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,800
that that's never that's never really

306
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:05,639
true in isolation of you know everything

307
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:09,719
else um with that qualifier I might

308
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:11,159
bring it back to bumat um well one thing

309
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,800
I I guess now we we're kind of getting

310
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,240
into the the the actual meat of the

311
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,719
conversation and there's a point here

312
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,839
about you know how one might try to

313
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,639
Define organic growing and there's

314
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,760
another phrase that you use bumat that

315
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,360
was kind of intrigued by which is uh the

316
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,838
Great Compromise so maybe do you want to

317
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
kick us off with some of that like what

318
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,800
are your your thoughts around you know

319
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,879
what what is organic growing and why do

320
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,719
you think of it as a great

321
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,198
compromise all right that let's get into

322
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,320
the meat of it this is going to be fun

323
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,359
so um first I'm going to kind of Define

324
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,399
at least from everything that I've read

325
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,039
and my an adonal experience the kind of

326
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,600
key differences between salt and organic

327
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,719
just on a very simple level there's a

328
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,800
lot more depth that we can go into this

329
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,399
later or another time but um salt is

330
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,000
essentially the most basic form of

331
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,039
mineral that a plant can absorb if it's

332
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,679
held in the right U suspension for it

333
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,838
and Organics is creating and utilizing

334
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:15,078
like a relationship a symbiotic

335
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,240
relationship with um fungal networks and

336
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:20,278
microbial networks within your actual

337
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,959
media um to facilitate an exchange of

338
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,838
sugars from the root Zone in the plant

339
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,679
uh with those microbes it'll exchange

340
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,800
those nutrients um

341
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,519
the Great Compromise is a

342
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,799
very growing organically indoors is kind

343
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,078
of ironic in a lot of ways um it's an

344
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:44,278
artificial light source uh you're using

345
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,319
uh more often than not a potting soil

346
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,759
that's coming out of a bag that's being

347
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,680
mixed by somebody at a facility and not

348
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,320
using traditional amended Earth although

349
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,239
that is a possibility if you have the

350
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,519
space and are willing to commit to it um

351
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,440
but the Great Compromise really centers

352
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,278
around what indoor grower has or indoor

353
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,079
organic grower has to

354
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:07,078
do when they're growing because you are

355
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:10,559
never going to actually follow nature

356
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:14,479
100% when you're adding in artificial

357
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:16,599
things so in my instance I was growing

358
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,399
in an apartment in a 2x4 for the last

359
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,240
two years and I I wanted to run through

360
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,919
plants I wanted to see as many different

361
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,600
fenos as of many different plaques that

362
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,198
I could see so I spent the last two

363
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,159
years just really going at it and never

364
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:36,439
grew the same plant twice um it really

365
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:38,919
taught me a lot and it forced me into

366
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,880
growing smaller sized plants in that

367
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:43,838
space and using one gallon pots which

368
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,919
ironically goes against a lot of living

369
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,240
soil kind of principles and ideas with

370
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,559
the small pots um I know I'm going to

371
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,959
get attacked for that one it's not

372
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:56,638
living soil

373
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:59,599
but I made it work it's very much

374
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,560
possible um if you just really pack you

375
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,000
know what if you know what you're using

376
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,719
and you understand the system

377
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,639
fundamentally you can appropriately size

378
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,839
your plants prior to flow with the right

379
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:15,120
amount of veg time and you can make the

380
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:18,560
system work um you can use things like

381
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,720
enzymes you can use uh all sorts of

382
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,318
ferments uh different things like that

383
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,600
to that can Aid and catalyze different

384
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:29,519
processes within your media to really

385
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,399
get the full use out of it um

386
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,399
but I've tried growing in 20 gallon pots

387
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,159
in a 2x4 and you can only fit two of

388
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,720
them in there and it gets really crowded

389
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:43,480
really fast so I was forced into a much

390
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,199
smaller compromise with smaller one

391
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,560
gallon pots in my space but

392
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,719
largely the compromise is an individual

393
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,758
compromise for every indoor organic

394
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,319
grower who's trying to find or trying to

395
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,839
follow a general PR the general organic

396
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:00,838
system of growing

397
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,119
cannabis so uh bum I have a

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,759
question yeah what's up so what what are

399
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,838
you doing uh for nutrition are you using

400
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,959
like fish

401
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:18,198
hydrate um to to feed them or you just

402
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,919
top dressing a bunch what what do you

403
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,360
because one one gallon is small so how

404
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,679
do you uh compensate for

405
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,839
that uh yeah I was using a lot of things

406
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,840
like fish hydrate and

407
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,798
uh

408
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:39,279
oh happened again all

409
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:41,759
righty okay so yeah I was using a lot of

410
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,079
things like fish hydraul aate and top

411
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,759
dressing a lot um I was also using

412
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,038
things like uh build of soil's big six

413
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,960
micros um I'm going to name drop a

414
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,319
handful of companies I am by no way

415
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,919
sponsored in any shape uh this podcast

416
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,879
is not sponsored in any shape we don't

417
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,679
not get paid for this we would love a

418
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,840
check though so come on on let's get it

419
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,320
but um yeah I was using a lot of things

420
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:10,480
like that in top dressing uh I'm a big

421
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:12,359
fan of uh Clackamus cot actually um I've

422
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,679
a lot of the build of soil ideology

423
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,199
which is a lot of things that taught me

424
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,000
like kind of the fundamental living soil

425
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,400
system principles um are derived

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,319
directly from a lot of the things that

427
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,000
he was talking about on the forums back

428
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,960
in the day so uh he's really big on

429
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
things like vermac compost which are

430
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,519
just essentially worm castings um and

431
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,919
and other things like um sprouted seed

432
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,679
teas I don't really Brew teas just

433
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
because it was really difficult and they

434
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,000
absolutely stink in

435
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,079
apartments um and that's kind of really

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,679
inconvenient for when you're actually

437
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,678
growing in a confined space where you're

438
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,440
not allowed to do that um but more or

439
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,919
less I was the way I was growing I was

440
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,798
doing like a weekl long veg I would go

441
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,320
straight from clone into a one gallon

442
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:01,200
pot of build of soil soil just any

443
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:03,480
runof-the-mill um um and essentially

444
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,679
when I would mix the actual pot and when

445
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,759
I was transplanting I would add probably

446
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,280
about

447
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,519
onethird of it as worm castings and then

448
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,000
I'd take some lava rock which are just

449
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,079
essentially really porous and AD Iration

450
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,919
and add about a third of those in and

451
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,558
then I would just grab about two pinches

452
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,960
worth just I'm more of a kind of just

453
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,960
dump and you'll see kind of cook at the

454
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,440
end but uh I don't really use a lot of

455
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,960
measurements we we'll get into this

456
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,840
later when we talk about pH that's going

457
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,240
to be a fun one too but um yeah I was

458
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,319
taking things like Kashi blind which is

459
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,640
a fermented grain product that is really

460
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,158
rich in things like nitrogen and I was

461
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,759
using other things like that to kind of

462
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:48,799
catalyze my process and allow I'm I kind

463
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,240
of followed a really intense dryback

464
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,720
push for the first couple weeks of

465
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,400
flower and that would really allow my

466
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,679
roots to get established within that

467
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,000
media and between depending on what I

468
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,798
was growing in the length of flowering

469
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,038
time I would top dress sometime between

470
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:05,200
day 14 and 28 um if things are going

471
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:08,440
like 10 11 plus weeks I the longest

472
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,759
thing anything I've grown is 13 weeks um

473
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,919
I would do something like closer to 28

474
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,480
days if I'm doing something shorter like

475
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,038
a eight to nine weer I'm going to do

476
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,319
something more along the lines of day 14

477
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,359
because I don't want a large amount of

478
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,879
nitrogen going into the later flowering

479
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,798
period i' would rather have the plant

480
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,840
try to pull as much of it possible um in

481
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,319
the beginning so when it's actually

482
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,439
using that in the earlier stages of

483
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,079
flower rather than getting an over

484
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,679
nitrogen um fed plant at towards the end

485
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:38,720
of flow but uh yeah I would kind of also

486
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:42,080
I remember KT talking about pulse

487
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,720
feedings being a thing from TLO I have

488
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,759
anodal experience of that working really

489
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,519
really well for me I would do something

490
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,158
like on day

491
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:54,319
21

492
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,480
um yeah about day 21 I would do a really

493
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:00,000
in high dose of like I want to say it's

494
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,360
two teaspoons per per gallon of of fish

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,400
hydrate and like a a dose and a half of

496
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,959
what's recommended for the um

497
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,038
micronutrients from the big six and I

498
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,360
would just really hit them hard for that

499
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:14,359
day and then that can would usually last

500
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:16,759
me about two days so it would be like

501
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,079
day 21 22 would get a really intense

502
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,319
feeding and then I would literally just

503
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:25,278
be water only with a handful of like

504
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:29,678
really small added um additives like uh

505
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,679
kuaha extract um or like a Horticultural

506
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,759
coconut

507
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,320
oil

508
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,879
um or a freeze-dried aloe vera powder um

509
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,759
anything like that that's rich in sapon

510
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,799
ISS that will help aid with like minor

511
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,798
turpine production and stuff like that

512
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:45,440
although that's kind of based on Theory

513
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:48,000
I've seen antidotal evidence in my own

514
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,000
grows of it

515
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,679
helping H nice

516
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:56,399
um how you you also grow in relatively

517
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,919
small containers right are were you

518
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,000
saying um what are your comments on this

519
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,919
uh yes I will I right now I'm doing one

520
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,720
gallons and I started out in twos and

521
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,159
threes but uh I wanted to look through

522
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,679
more plants and I've slowly adapted to

523
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,240
where um I'm able to do one gallons with

524
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,919
the with the TLO uh since everything's

525
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,919
pretty it runs pretty hot in t uh I'm

526
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,480
able to do the one gallons because

527
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,559
there's enough food in there to where

528
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,919
I've only done water before you're not

529
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,519
going to get yield but that's not what

530
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,360
my uh importance is I don't care about

531
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,400
yield I care about just good smoke for

532
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,038
myself

533
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,320
um uh yeah I don't there's not really a

534
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,440
whole lot I do I've done all kinds of

535
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,000
different stuff because like I said

536
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,960
within TLO there's different stuff you

537
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,919
can do uh there's a microp pond uh

538
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,240
strategy you can use um which is like uh

539
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,360
after watering you can add uh stuff on

540
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,480
top say like alfalfa meal you can add

541
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,839
that up until about you know the about

542
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,720
halfway through so say about day 28 you

543
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,119
know you could stop something like that

544
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,240
uh it's kind of weird for people because

545
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,959
I know they think that will cause a lot

546
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,159
of harms I know that's a big thing with

547
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,038
the trantel I believe that's how you say

548
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,080
it I'm not exactly sure uh because I

549
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,640
always have to read I I never hear

550
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,079
people read uh uh say words I always

551
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,240
have to read them myself so I'm not sure

552
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,599
what that is but I know that's a big

553
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,919
thing with Al falam uh people think um

554
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,599
and there's just other stuff I've done

555
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,880
top dressings and all that uh spikes

556
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,278
there's all different kinds of stuff you

557
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,000
can do uh and I just kind of utilize

558
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:30,798
depending on what's going to happen in

559
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,880
the future depending so if right now I'm

560
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,599
running really really super hot so I

561
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,919
wanted to make sure I have a lot of food

562
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,480
so this time I did spikes and I'm doing

563
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,640
um uh the churn it's a little bit of

564
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,038
microp pond uh just doing different kind

565
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,960
of stuff because uh everything's just

566
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,919
everything's messed up right now so

567
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,519
because there nothing's nothing's uh

568
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,960
going right you know I'm all every day

569
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,038
switching so especially in the

570
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,319
California

571
00:23:54,038 --> 00:24:00,679
heat yeah very nice thank you um bumat

572
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,480
did did you have any prompts for Kyle or

573
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,240
scrwen based on what you were saying any

574
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,240
questions for them in

575
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:11,558
turn um not off the top of my head I'll

576
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,600
let you know if I do

577
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:17,079
though uh what did you want to move on

578
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,079
to next all right I have a fun one uh

579
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:23,439
we're gonna go back to the first round

580
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:26,038
table of you spindle NN and local um

581
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,399
we're gonna touch on yeah we're gonna go

582
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:31,359
back uh we're gonna touch on the higher

583
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:34,678
floor and higher ceiling than salt um

584
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:37,119
topic I really yeah we're going back to

585
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,559
it I want to talk about this okay okay

586
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,079
do you want to St really clearly what

587
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,960
what was said uh what what was said in

588
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,918
the episode so the conversation that you

589
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,759
guys had really centered around the

590
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,960
concept of Organics in general having

591
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,398
essentially a higher ceiling and a

592
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,200
higher floor than salts um I really have

593
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,158
mixed feelings about that statement kind

594
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,360
of as a whole I feel it's a slight

595
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,679
misnomer um because I feel like the

596
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,879
level of Entry to find really good

597
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,600
knowledge can be quite difficult it for

598
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,640
a new person I would have sorry to

599
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,398
interrupt you but yeah I would have

600
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,440
thought it maybe higher ceiling lower

601
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,519
floor yeah I would risk that's

602
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,120
definitely what I would have said

603
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,158
because I've myself have grown some

604
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:21,000
absolutely horrendous

605
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,559
Organics um i' I've seen it myself like

606
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,200
I've been there so I I wanted to get

607
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:29,278
KT's and scr's opinion on this um but I

608
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,000
essentially for me I feel like once you

609
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,798
understand the basic concepts of like

610
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,720
how these systems work and how you're

611
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,639
kind of utilizing the general

612
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,880
relationships of microbes and and fungus

613
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,240
within that root system it's pretty easy

614
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,039
to manipulate but I feel like getting to

615
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,399
that point like takes a little bit of

616
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:49,398
more dedication and like actual time

617
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:51,479
like researching and understanding

618
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:55,319
general concepts within

619
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,159
Organics um but yeah I I wanted to get

620
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,000
the other two's opinion on that because

621
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,720
I feel personally

622
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,398
um a lot of organic Growers are so

623
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,000
tribal they will not they're not willing

624
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:06,879
to admit that you can grow bad weed

625
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,558
organically but I know from firsthand

626
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,278
experience it's very possible to

627
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:14,759
do okay yeah that that's a good one yeah

628
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:17,319
uh maybe you go back to scrwen uh before

629
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:19,359
Kyle and scren what's your experience in

630
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:22,038
terms of like the best and the worst you

631
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:25,719
know like uh how hard was it to get

632
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:28,000
going you know yeah uh so I definitely

633
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,440
agree with that you know you can grow

634
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,599
bad organic weed I promise you um it's

635
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,480
not very

636
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:41,918
hard

637
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:45,360
uh but the top end um that I'm a little

638
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:50,120
iffy on because I've had really really

639
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:54,319
good um like pure salt run

640
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:57,239
stuff um maybe like shelf life I I've

641
00:26:54,319 --> 00:27:00,879
definitely noticed that

642
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:05,759
um like even I you know my friend group

643
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:10,120
down here uh some of them do grow both

644
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:12,038
ways and there seems to be a a

645
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:16,000
longevity

646
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:18,440
um like bonus on their on their organic

647
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,200
stuff it just the quality seems to stay

648
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,640
a little bit longer with it and I don't

649
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,919
I don't know why um I don't know if it's

650
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,600
because it's just more

651
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,820
well-rounded

652
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:31,079
like while growing or what

653
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:33,720

00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:37,079
um but yeah there's a lot of really bad

655
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,079
information about Organics um and I

656
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,278
don't

657
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,839
it's I don't know it's hard enough as

658
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,798
someone new coming in even when you get

659
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,000
you know good information it's hard

660
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:50,519
enough to start kind of actually

661
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,759
applying it correctly and

662
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,319
stuff

663
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,359
um but there's like there's a lot of

664
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,319
real you know you could always just go

665
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,278
off of the bottles hey I'm going to get

666
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,639
a and b and this dude told me to get you

667
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,200
know a cow mag supplement and just go by

668
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,480
the the rates that it says on the

669
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,399
bottles and you're probably going to do

670
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,480
pretty all right you

671
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,599
know I think that's a really good

672
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,278
observation though and I think bumat did

673
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,439
I mean all of you have alluded to this

674
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,640
in in some degree or to some degree the

675
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,240
notion

676
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,519
that the resources that you have access

677
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,079
to and the information itself is kind of

678
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,240
like a not a it's a

679
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:33,558
I was going to say it's a problem but

680
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,839
like you can talk about technique but

681
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:38,038
like yeah if you if you can't even get

682
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:41,079
reliable information then you're not you

683
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:44,398
know how do you even start properly

684
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:46,439
um Kyle what's your experience of the

685
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,639
floor quote unquote and ceiling of

686
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,360
organic

687
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,919
growing oh yeah well uh I only grow

688
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,079
really great stuff obviously no no no no

689
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,159
obviously i' gr I've obviously grown

690
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,759
some bad stuff obviously you can I mean

691
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,679
that that that's that's kind of silly um

692
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,759
uh everybody has bad grows I I don't

693
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,759
care who you are I've seen it every

694
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,599
everybody has bad grows if everybody who

695
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,720
doesn't is I think they're they'd be

696
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,439
lying to you got a pretty bad going

697
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,919
right now yeah yeah I mean hey it

698
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
happens I mean yeah I Ally I always have

699
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,880
problems it's always I'm always trying

700
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
to fix something it happens you know

701
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,240
open your tent up and it's like oh great

702
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,159
here what what what I got to fix today

703
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,519
I'm thinking oh great just water no it

704
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,640
ends up into you know 45 minutes of

705
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,319
something you know trying to fix

706
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,000
something or you know what happened um

707
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,119
trying to figure out well hey why why

708
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,480
that H you know why is this color on the

709
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,158
leafes now why what you know type of

710
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,440
thing

711
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,159
um yeah and as far as resources uh what

712
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,120
I found was best to uh great organic um

713
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,480
resources are older stuff like rodale's

714
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:51,199
rodale's organic composting rodale's

715
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,519
organic um gardening those are really

716
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,720
great books because they're older and

717
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,159
they don't have a lot of that corporate

718
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,640
growing type of stuff in um thrown in

719
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,240
there type of thing so I always found

720
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,038
the older stuff is always better to go

721
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,640
back on especially the books but

722
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,440
rodelles are always found are pretty

723
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,519
good too for especially for organic

724
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,038
stuff going back for um for starting out

725
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,240
because it gives you uh not just it's

726
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,000
not just cannabis it's growing organic

727
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,798
all in general which is great because it

728
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,960
gives you the whole spectrum of all

729
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,839
plants and I found that was that really

730
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,600
helped me out understand uh before I

731
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,079
even started growing uh I help me

732
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:33,319
understand the basics of what was going

733
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,199
on and then eventually once you get uh

734
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:36,599
you got to be consistent with it and

735
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,759
then once you get consistent with you

736
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,240
kind of just fall into your own method

737
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,319
and that's like me like some of the

738
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,960
stuff I do I just kind of don't even

739
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,079
have to measure type of thing I just

740
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,558
kind of know oh this is what's happening

741
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,839
and then I fix it and then you know you

742
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,240
just kind of get into your own method

743
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:57,278
and then you just kind of know what's

744
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,278
going on so

745
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,039
um I should have said this earlier uh

746
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,240
when I introduced this whole episode but

747
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm not an organic grower uh so maybe

748
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,200
one thing I wanted to and it's probably

749
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,440
a bit of a tangent for now but uh one

750
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,399
thing I wanted to ask for any of you

751
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,080
really but maybe I can direct it bombcat

752
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,359
to begin with are you able to generalize

753
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:23,359
for me what the major differences

754
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:25,798
between the I guess m popular systems

755
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,398
are that you guys have have discussed

756
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:28,879
like you know you mentioned um what is

757
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:32,638
this like

758
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,039
T knf like living Soul like are there

759
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:37,119
you know are there broad distinctions

760
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:38,720
that you could draw that like might help

761
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,638
people understand what these different

762
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,639
approaches

763
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:45,439
are yeah so um these are all kind of

764
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:48,000
systems that have been founded by

765
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,519
different people in different areas for

766
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,679
different needs overall um living soil

767
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,720
no till there's a lot of academics that

768
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,880
are like very very highly educated on

769
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,159
soil science and soil biology and like

770
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,080
the makeup of soil and all of that and

771
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,000
they a lot of them are really pushing

772
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,839
the living soil noil type of systems for

773
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,839
larger scale a um like agriculture to

774
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,119
help preserve and feed more people

775
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,398
without essentially destroying the

776
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,119
environment through commercial

777
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,239
agriculture that's a whole argument in

778
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,599
of itself um T I am not the most

779
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,798
familiar with I'll probably definitely

780
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:31,199
defer to KT on that one but for knf and

781
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,000
jadam they are kind of offshoots of each

782
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,720
other I believe k&amp;f was the original

783
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,558
what k&amp;f stands for Korean natural

784
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,558
farming and it's largely centered around

785
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:44,079
being able to farm in a system that is

786
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:47,038
entirely closed Loops to anything

787
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,960
outside your local so you're not using

788
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,919
anything commercial whatsoever

789
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,480
everything that you're using is um

790
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,278
essentially fermented and then used

791
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,599
within dilution rates or varying

792
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,839
dilution rates for different things um

793
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,319
there's so many different types of

794
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,359
ferments that have offshoot out of that

795
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,798
um then there's jadam which I believe I

796
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,798
could be wrong on this one but I believe

797
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:17,599
jadam was written by the author of k&amp;f

798
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:18,398
son who um focused more on less a heavy

799
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,798
um

800
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,839
food within the ferments and more

801
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,398
focused on like microbial and bacterial

802
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,278
growth and uh using those fungal and

803
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:30,719
bacterial systems within your soil

804
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,839
um and then you have like smaller little

805
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,079
cannabis based offshoots from those

806
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:37,839
systems like I've heard people talk

807
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,319
about like Pacific Northwest Natural

808
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,319
farming um there's all sorts of

809
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,519
different kinds of thing but essentially

810
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,599
each one was founded by a different

811
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,038
group or

812
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:50,678
individual um that all kind of are

813
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,038
slightly off and different from each

814
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,278
other they're it's kind of like salt and

815
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:58,038
Organics Al like in the broader sense

816
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,599
like it's each system is a a little bit

817
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,278
more applicable and easier for certain

818
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,638
individuals like I have a couple buddies

819
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:06,440
who are absolutely phenomenal k&amp;f and

820
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:08,440
jadam Growers um everything they do is

821
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,079
focused around fermenting and harvesting

822
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,039
within their local using all sorts of

823
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,679
crazy stuff like horsetail nettle and

824
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:20,159
fermenting those in different types of

825
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,960
um sugar Solutions with water you can do

826
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,200
all sorts of different stuff like that

827
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,320
but they are all different systems

828
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,319
within the larger category of growing

829
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,240
organically with living soil kind of

830
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,119
being the most traditional amended Earth

831
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:36,479
style of organic

832
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,519
growing no thank you that you did really

833
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,440
well because like I I you know kind of

834
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:46,398
just fir it at you on the spot um thank

835
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:49,000
you very much for for that um we can you

836
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,878
know if we return to that like the floor

837
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,559
ceiling

838
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,519
conversation was there anything else you

839
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,078
wanted to add on that I saw that in the

840
00:34:54,519 --> 00:35:00,719
outline you had an analogy skiing snowb

841
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,599
is that is that yours yeah that's me so

842
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,000
um at least I don't I can't speak for

843
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,880
everybody on this but for me I've done

844
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,480
the little bit of both and I picked up

845
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,358
snowboarding really really easily and I

846
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,079
had a really hard time picking up skiing

847
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:20,039
um but once I picked up skiing I found

848
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,599
it a lot easier to actually do like ski

849
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,119
and do that instead of snowboard and I

850
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,200
found it much more difficult to get

851
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,280
better at snowboarding than I did at

852
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:31,199
skiing so for me it's it's like a really

853
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,960
clear reference that it's like for some

854
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,559
people U growing within Organics is

855
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,320
definitely going to be the better way

856
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,838
it's some for some people it just fits

857
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,200
their individual system of how they

858
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:45,559
understand to grow plants um and some

859
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,159
people have a really hard time with

860
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,679
Organics and some people have a really

861
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,920
good time with Organics the same way

862
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,879
with salt uh I wanted to reiterate a

863
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,119
point I believe that both KT and

864
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,280
Christen made earlier that there is no

865
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:01,960
individual way to grow everything

866
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,160
universally better it really comes down

867
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,720
to the individual and their preferences

868
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,318
and their understanding of the systems

869
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,719
that they're using and the time spent to

870
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:14,759
actually understand what's going on and

871
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,759
how those processes

872
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:24,358
work well said um any comments or

873
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:27,000
questions from Kyle L Kristen at this

874
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,559
point no not that I can think of that's

875
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,559
pretty good

876
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,920
nope

877
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,679
um I don't know when you were talking

878
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,599
about this uh skiing snowboarding thing

879
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,239
it kind of brought to mind like do you

880
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,960
think an implication here is also that

881
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,598
if

882
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,440
you if you can understand organic

883
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,559
growing

884
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,240
um how I put it do you think it

885
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,119
necessitates having a finer

886
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,799
understanding of the plant and its needs

887
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,838
and the the the ecosystem and all that

888
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,079
seems like that's kind of what you're

889
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:00,318
saying

890
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,760
I think it

891
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:05,559
definitely yeah I want to say Yes um

892
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,960
it's hard to say that with absolute

893
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,000
confidence but for me personally at

894
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:14,440
least from my observations it feels that

895
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,318
like I'm at least in my friend group I'm

896
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,240
a little bit more in tune with having to

897
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,960
deal with like individuals on an

898
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:25,759
individual level and kind of Aid to them

899
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,039
so I feel that yeah it kind of forces a

900
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,079
like a more Keen Eye and like a little

901
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,960
bit more centered focus on like each

902
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,440
individual as opposed to kind of being

903
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,280
able to run a system where in salt you

904
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,200
could it's a universal recipe that you

905
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,680
slowly adjust over time for those

906
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,159
individuals once you've actually

907
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:50,679
understood them um it kind of goes back

908
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:53,279
to the idea of like Organics the plant

909
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:55,719
feeds individually within an organic

910
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,240
system as it pleases pulling what

911
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:01,239
nutrients it desires out of it

912
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,639
soil within that facilitation of

913
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:07,439
exchange of nutrients for sugars in the

914
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:10,159
root zone so in Organics it's indiv the

915
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,039
plant actually is doing all the work for

916
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,480
you in the root Zone all you need to do

917
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,199
is give it little things here or there

918
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,199
to do like to like essentially as

919
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:23,598
additives but that's that's at least my

920
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:27,078
perspective on

921
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,200
it I've heard this go Kyle you go oh I

922
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,119
was going to say well I think it's more

923
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,480
of like a I guess uh I don't know

924
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,200
without without being offensive it's

925
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,519
like a trust thing so I mean I mean

926
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:39,159
you're basically an Organics you're

927
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,759
you're you're letting it's a more of a

928
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:44,960
like Teo is like basically all natural

929
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,440
it's it's as close to mimicking Mother

930
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,720
Nature as possible uh so you're you're

931
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,920
trusting that the plant knows what it

932
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:55,078
what it what it knows to do for tens of

933
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,880
thousands of years compared to say Sy

934
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,920
synthetic you're you have to feed it

935
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,440
every single day day uh and to me that

936
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,559
like you're not having trust in what the

937
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,079
plant does type of thing like you you

938
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,759
want to have control over everything

939
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,800
that you're feeding it and compared to

940
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,119
Organics you're just having trust that

941
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,240
what you put in there the plant's going

942
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,640
to know what it what it does type of

943
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,639
thing very well

944
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,839
said we talked about I don't know bumat

945
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:26,519
did you want to get into like you kind

946
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:29,199
of went towards mechanisms like uh

947
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,759
uptake and in the outline you have a

948
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,039
point that's like comparing nutrient

949
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,040
uptake between organic and salt I mean

950
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,279
is that what you you just highlighted

951
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,800
essentially yeah more or less um I can

952
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:45,400
kind of go I can refer back to my

953
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,400
outline real quick um but

954
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,040
essentially all right I want to phrase

955
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:53,400
this correctly um Organics is creating

956
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,639
and utilizing the relationship uh

957
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,519
symbiotic relationship with various

958
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:01,000
fungal and bacterial systems in your

959
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:04,318
media that facilitate that exchange of

960
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,079
sugars and um that's actually called the

961
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,639
ryop fagus it's a relatively newer

962
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,560
scientific discovery I want to say it

963
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:15,358
was first written about about 20 years

964
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:19,039
ago um uh you can look more into it but

965
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:21,039
that essentially is the

966
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,159
actual exchange where the actual

967
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:26,519
exchange happens with the

968
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:32,199
bacteria in when you're feeding chelated

969
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:32,199
nutrients to a plant the

970
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,358
actual I wna sorry I want to phrase this

971
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,000
correctly but the

972
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:41,880
actual um bacteria that are creating

973
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,358
that Exchange in the root Zone start to

974
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,200
die off similar to how muscles work this

975
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,880
is the uh the best way I've understood

976
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,358
it um when you don't use a muscle over

977
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,358
time it dies off and it atrophies that's

978
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:55,799
essentially what happens when you're

979
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,799
feeding chelated nutrients to a plant's

980
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,280
root Zone um when you're using an

981
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,640
organic system what's going on is

982
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,960
through that Riso fungus the plant is

983
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,000
forced to exchange sugars for that

984
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,720
nutrition otherwise the plant doesn't

985
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,480
have the ability to actually uptake the

986
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:14,399
nutrition it's within that actual

987
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,358
symbiotic relationship which is where

988
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,000
the exchange of nutrients occurs for the

989
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:25,119
plant to actually feed

990
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,039
itself so um yeah I believe that really

991
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:31,519
highlights the main one um second big

992
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,079
difference I've read and seen um is that

993
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,280
through these relationships with uh

994
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,880
fungi and

995
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,079
bacteria you can more easily access

996
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,599
second like secondary metabolites which

997
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,480
can Aid in producing a higher quality

998
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,680
product that is no guarantee that is

999
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,400
what's happening that is my

1000
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,679
understanding from my reading that I've

1001
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,559
done on this subject um it's a very

1002
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,159
nuanced and very complex subject with a

1003
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,559
lot of arguments and a lot of different

1004
00:41:54,159 --> 00:42:00,199
perspectives on this side um but from

1005
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,719
everything that I've read and gathered

1006
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:04,960
this is essentially what's happening in

1007
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,639
your root system I and I'm not saying

1008
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,199
that grow if you're growing in an

1009
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,719
organic system and you're applying that

1010
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:12,318
trust of the plant to act like do

1011
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,679
everything that it

1012
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,679
needs you

1013
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,400
are it's not there is I'm not saying

1014
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,239
Organics is better overall because of

1015
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,800
that exchange you can still grow

1016
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:29,519
absolutely phenomenal product just like

1017
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,079
scrwen said um with salt nutrition I do

1018
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:35,519
it at work pretty like every day it we

1019
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,200
grow great product it's easy to do um I

1020
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,318
believe that this is where the echelon

1021
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:42,719
of like the high the highest Echelon of

1022
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,000
highest quality cannabis can come from

1023
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,919
but it's not a guarantee in any fa like

1024
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,400
any way um it still requires all the

1025
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,639
effort and the individual attention of

1026
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,400
the grower to actually get that done

1027
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,879
within that system I just believe the

1028
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,838
system can help you more easily access

1029
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,160
it once you have a better understanding

1030
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:04,358
of it as a

1031
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,679
whole very nice yeah I'm I'm very

1032
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,159
impressed that you

1033
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,039
can I'm I'm trying I'm walking a fine

1034
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,399
line I know I'm gonna get some DMS about

1035
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:15,239
this but it's I'm everything I'm reading

1036
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm going off of it is stuff that I've

1037
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:21,358
read online more often than not coming

1038
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:24,000
from academic sources um I majored in

1039
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:27,799
English in college so I have no issue

1040
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,119
reading I will dive head first yeah I

1041
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,839
dive head first right into a 60-page

1042
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,599
paper if I need to understand something

1043
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,119
just so I can make my life a little bit

1044
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,760
easier in that actual understanding of

1045
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,358
the process totally and and I will say

1046
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,680
this as well kind of going back to my

1047
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:46,519
earlier qualifier like we're not here to

1048
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,519
um distribute Theory perfectly that's

1049
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,440
not really the point yeah we're here to

1050
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:53,400
to kind of talk about experience and and

1051
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,800
opinions on on these things so yeah we

1052
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,880
we may not get it perfect but I think

1053
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,839
people are going to get the idea at

1054
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,440
least

1055
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:05,480
um

1056
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:09,720
okay uh anything else on on this on the

1057
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,199
me on mechanisms uh bumat otherwise what

1058
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:15,719
would you like to talk about next um we

1059
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:17,960
can touch on like cat on Exchange if you

1060
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:21,118
want to get into that like with cocoa

1061
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,880
versus like a a traditional potting soil

1062
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:28,200
type of thing I have a rough

1063
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,800
little paragraph on it um maybe before

1064
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:33,439
yeah that sounds good I mean before we

1065
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,119
dump uh jump into that Kyle and scren um

1066
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,358
what different kinds of media have you

1067
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,358
guys

1068
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:44,639
used uh well I've only done the refo so

1069
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,078
right now I'm going I'm doing my

1070
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,920
recycled uh soil and it's been five

1071
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:52,440
years and so yeah I just been Recycling

1072
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,800
and re amending and in the beginning I

1073
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,400
did use coco as a pH buffer but uh well

1074
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,640
obviously so get out there but that's me

1075
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,079
then for irration uh but I don't use

1076
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:05,400
that anymore because uh but I could use

1077
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,599
coco because it does decompose So

1078
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,000
eventually you know uh that's Obviously

1079
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,160
good for you know what I in in my thing

1080
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,079
for the decomposition and it's a pH

1081
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:19,239
neutral so um yeah that's basically it

1082
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,559
I've only used the the revs remended

1083
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:24,558
soil

1084
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:29,400
so nice

1085
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:33,319
SC uh so I I mix soil up um just like

1086
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:38,358
your simple the quote unquote Coots mix

1087
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:42,318
which is just an augmented Cornell mix

1088
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:45,598
um and in one of my beds I used black

1089
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,838
leaf mold instead of Pete Moss and then

1090
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,680
in the in the other bed I used your

1091
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:54,639
traditional uh stagnum Pete Moss as the

1092
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:57,529
base they both work fine they both have

1093
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,759
been working fine for years now

1094
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,119
[Music]

1095
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:06,119
um and I just I just use a like a

1096
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:09,800
regular uh not out of preference but

1097
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:13,358
just because it's what's at my uh at my

1098
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:17,280
local hydro store I get uh the builda

1099
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:20,119
soil 3.0 for my veg stuff since that's

1100
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,119
actually moving

1101
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:29,078
through nice thank

1102
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:31,000
you yeah bumat uh we can talk about C

1103
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:33,800
exchange nutrient uptake soil versus

1104
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:39,440
Coco if you want to kick it off all

1105
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:43,240
right um so yes soil has a higher Caton

1106
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:46,000
cat ion exchange than a media like cocoa

1107
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:48,519
um but in my opinion that negates the

1108
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,280
whole concept of um the individual

1109
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:53,119
plants having a preferred rate of

1110
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,359
nutrition over the course of veg and

1111
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,480
flour um there's something to do with a

1112
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:01,519
media like cocoa that acts kind of more

1113
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,318
like a direct inject IV where everything

1114
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,838
that you're watering into the the media

1115
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,800
itself the plant is immedi if it's in

1116
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,639
the right suspension the plant is free

1117
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,880
to absorb all of it and there's nothing

1118
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:17,558
stopping it whereas in soil because you

1119
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,960
have that relationship with the microbes

1120
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:23,160
and fungus that the plant uses to eat um

1121
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,199
it allows the plant to actually dictate

1122
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:29,519
which nutrients are uptaken and which

1123
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:32,598
nutrients will not um the roots of a

1124
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,599
plant grown in a salt system lose that

1125
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,240
ability to pick and choose which

1126
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,079
nutrients are being absorbed if it's in

1127
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:45,439
the right suspension ultimately the

1128
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,440
plant is going to uptake it as a whole

1129
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,838
um I feel like a good kind of way to

1130
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,440
describe this is that uh salt gives the

1131
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:57,199
grower a lot more control to be able to

1132
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,480
choose what's available when for the

1133
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,558
plant to eat whereas in soil you're

1134
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,400
giving that trust in the plant the

1135
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:08,519
actual control to grow and choose what

1136
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:14,039
it wants when um I've watched firsthand

1137
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:15,920
at work um we use Athena 3.0 recipe we

1138
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,920
run that high EC we're we're a

1139
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,240
production facility um and I've watched

1140
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:25,838
firsthand at work that like plants will

1141
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:28,838
not be happy and will not react happily

1142
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:31,519
to a High feed if that's not what they

1143
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:34,078
want um a great example of this would be

1144
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,759
any Puck type genetics that I've seen or

1145
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,680
Puck hybrids for that matter that I've

1146
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,800
seen they are not particular fans

1147
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:45,078
whatsoever of any high nutrition um I

1148
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,519
did a little antidotal experiment for

1149
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,960
myself um my boss was kind enough to let

1150
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,119
me take one of those home that didn't

1151
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,760
make the cut and I was curious and I ran

1152
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,640
one of them just in the tent just to see

1153
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,920
like I wonder if this plant will grow a

1154
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:59,798
little bit better if it's just not

1155
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,400
getting pushed as hard by being forc fed

1156
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:05,400
things that it doesn't necessarily want

1157
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:08,400
at this time um the plant the plan at

1158
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,519
work was about 2 feet tall little like

1159
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,160
individual bra stacked right on top of

1160
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:16,239
each other and at home when a in a one

1161
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:19,960
gallon pot with a really heavy top dress

1162
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,439
on like I think it was day 17 um it

1163
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,039
turned out phenomenal and it grew to

1164
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,720
about a three and a half 4ot plant in a

1165
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:30,719
one gon pot um smoked great looked way

1166
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:33,199
better smell was way more pungent um

1167
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:36,318
this is just kind of more of my anodal

1168
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:39,199
experience of like actually seeing that

1169
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,920
plants don't always like being force-fed

1170
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:44,358
certain things at certain times um I

1171
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,358
know local prior in one of the round

1172
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:49,159
taes has kind of brought up that uh in

1173
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:51,639
like Jacks there's I believe it's um

1174
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:54,679
nitrogen is tied to calcium and so it

1175
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:56,679
has like he has he said he's voiced that

1176
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:58,358
before he's had a hard time with uh

1177
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:00,719
certain plants not just not wanting that

1178
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:04,039
much uh nitrogen but he they need a

1179
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,679
little bit more calcium at the time so

1180
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:09,920
those those two being tied kind of can

1181
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:11,598
cause some problems um but this is just

1182
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,400
from my general experience and things

1183
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,400
that I've been listening

1184
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:20,318
to yeah Kyle and scen any

1185
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:22,639
any any like anecdotes from your own

1186
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,318
experience on this

1187
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:28,358
topic uh well from my understanding when

1188
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:29,798
you feed uh well at least liquid sanics

1189
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,239
the way I understand it is but the

1190
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:33,679
preservatives and additives that get

1191
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:35,798
added that keep it for shelf life that

1192
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,838
is actually what fees the nutrients to

1193
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:41,798
the plant and it's all force fed that's

1194
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,078
my understanding of what I've read and

1195
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:44,759
stuff like that obviously that's not

1196
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,280
anecdotal you know because I've never

1197
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,200
done that but that's why I think Sanic

1198
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,440
works as it's overfeeding and the plant

1199
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:53,679
just takes what it can and that's

1200
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,838
actually from the preservatives of an

1201
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,000
additives it's not actually the

1202
00:50:54,838 --> 00:51:00,119
nutrients that's in it and I don't know

1203
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,079
about the nitrogen and calcium as far as

1204
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,000
I know calcium has to be delivered

1205
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,880
through the plant in the soil or through

1206
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,880
water because it's not mobile so I don't

1207
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,318
actually know about that

1208
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,480
part um I think that's pretty much it

1209
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,039
that's kind of what you know what I was

1210
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,119
thinking about while he was uh

1211
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:24,480
mentioning all that stuff yeah thank you

1212
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:29,000
scen any thoughts on that any

1213
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:33,559
comments uh so I don't think that I am

1214
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,838
um smart enough to have that type of a

1215
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:42,640
you know conversation but I will say

1216
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:44,558
that um in Hydro it felt like whatever

1217
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,358
whatever I ended up selecting was

1218
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:51,160
essentially whichever one you know ended

1219
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:54,798
up best which that's normal

1220
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:58,279
but in my soil runs while I'm you know

1221
00:51:54,798 --> 00:52:01,119
sifting through packs of seeds

1222
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:04,240
it's a lot easier for me to even if I

1223
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,838
can't nail it like nail a plant to

1224
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:11,798
really [ __ ] perform best I still get

1225
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:14,239
a much better Baseline that I'm able to

1226
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:17,759
end up with you know a product at the

1227
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:20,679
end to decide on hey this is you know is

1228
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:25,839
this worth keeping moving forward and

1229
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,838
trying to like get it to its best

1230
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:35,680
yeah absolutely that makes sense I mean

1231
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:37,239
I I was thinking right well bumat was

1232
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,679
kind of giving us a a really nice

1233
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:41,159
account of like the various mechanisms

1234
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:42,798
that I guess there are a couple

1235
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:46,719
different ways that some one could

1236
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:49,920
approach this you could you could I

1237
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,519
imagine uh make changes purely based on

1238
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,119
your observations right without really

1239
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,759
knowing the theory which is like a just

1240
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,280
a process of like trial and error heris

1241
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,119
stics like

1242
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,280
you're basically just watching the

1243
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,318
plant and trying different things and

1244
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,000
seeing what it does right which is a

1245
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,119
different way of looking at it it's more

1246
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,920
of a like blackbox kind of approach and

1247
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,160
maybe uh coming back to bump cat I'm

1248
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,760
curious like when you when you were

1249
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:17,879
getting into this like I imagine at

1250
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:20,880
times your experience and the theory you

1251
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,519
know wouldn't always be in Step um did

1252
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,440
you find that you had to do a lot of

1253
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:28,159
experimenting on your own um outside of

1254
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,679
the theory to actually like refine your

1255
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:33,358
approach yeah there was uh I'm still

1256
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,078
experimenting to be completely honest

1257
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:39,960
with you um every run I always learn

1258
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,359
something new um this plant never ceases

1259
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:46,679
to teach me something that I thought I

1260
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:49,039
understood um but yeah this

1261
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:50,598
my my growing career has been a lot of

1262
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:51,759
trial and error and just trying

1263
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:55,440
different things and seeing how they

1264
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:59,799
react um being forced into the 2x4 is

1265
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,960
really like kind of forced me into

1266
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:05,000
actually being able to understand and

1267
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,760
run through plants like the way that I

1268
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,798
wanted to I needed to understand what

1269
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,880
was happening with the actual mechanisms

1270
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:16,519
so I was forced into very much like

1271
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:19,000
reverting back to just the same books

1272
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:20,639
going rereading the same passages over

1273
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,519
and over again just to make sure that I

1274
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,598
fully understood the concept and that I

1275
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:26,798
didn't misread or misunderstand what

1276
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,280
they were actually trying to communicate

1277
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:32,639
um same thing with the build-a soil

1278
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:35,440
videos it's because Organics tends to be

1279
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,598
in larger pots it's been a constant okay

1280
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,760
what do I need to do to adjust for this

1281
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,680
is this I know that like for example

1282
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,640
diesel plants are really heavy eaters um

1283
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,558
I know that if I put a diesel in a one

1284
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,199
gallon pot that's over8 inches when I

1285
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,720
flip it to flour it's probably going to

1286
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:52,118
end up close to three and a half four

1287
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:55,078
feet and it's going to be really really

1288
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:57,519
hungry so I know I I need to feed a

1289
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:00,318
little bit more with in my top dress or

1290
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:03,039
maybe add in even a second shot of like

1291
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:05,480
fish hydrate early on in flour to kind

1292
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:09,400
of alleviate the pressure on the media

1293
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:11,400
doing all the work um but yeah it's it's

1294
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,119
been a constant run of trial and error

1295
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,880
little things here and there okay let's

1296
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,680
try feeding one plant the whole way

1297
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,680
through flower and see what happens with

1298
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,000
no flush uh let's do one where they're

1299
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:24,598
going to get just water only let's do

1300
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,838
one where I'm going to do a little bit

1301
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:29,400
of pulse feeding with a top dress

1302
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,798
um and it's it it really comes down to

1303
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:36,000
the individuals as well um certain

1304
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:39,318
plants don't like certain things like um

1305
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,318
I ran a Sensei star Puck a couple fenos

1306
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:46,440
of that and one of them did not like

1307
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:48,400
anything to do with a mustard meal that

1308
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,720
I used in my top dress which kind of

1309
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,280
catalyzes the microbial processes and um

1310
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,759
within the top dress to break down a

1311
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,079
little bit faster it made the soil a

1312
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,359
little hot and The Roots freaked out and

1313
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:06,119
the plant just died like and that was on

1314
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:10,199
day 23 um it's a constant trial and

1315
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:13,039
error of new ideas like okay what about

1316
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:15,239
this um let's try this here it's just

1317
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,160
it's constantly just let's do little

1318
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:20,038
adjustments one at a time to see what

1319
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,798
happens and how the plant

1320
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:24,640
reacts yeah and why I wanted to gesture

1321
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,280
towards this is because it I think it

1322
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,960
highlights really well that despite

1323
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,359
there being a lot of theory and a lot of

1324
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,280
theory that one could go and consume

1325
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:36,440
there's obviously going to be a limit um

1326
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,319
to how much that can apply to your

1327
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,880
specific situation your specific

1328
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:44,719
individual and so yeah there's there's a

1329
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,880
necessary limit to Theory and how much

1330
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:49,358
it can do for you and I just wanted to

1331
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,119
you know yeah point that out yeah you

1332
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:54,400
can absolutely you can absolutely drown

1333
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:56,280
in the Theory online um there's

1334
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,280
everybody has an opinion and everybody

1335
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,359
body thinks that their opinion is the

1336
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,920
most based in fact um my biggest

1337
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:06,679
recommendation would be to check them

1338
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,280
against other sources do the little bit

1339
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:09,879
of extra work do that half hour of

1340
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,359
reading it's really going to go a long

1341
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,240
way it's going to save you a lot of time

1342
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,440
and

1343
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:18,078
headache yeah and I I think about this

1344
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,000
uh in not just in organic growing but

1345
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,480
like in all facets of of of this plant

1346
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,440
which is that

1347
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,719
um you can't take theory for granted

1348
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,358
there is no

1349
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,838
there's not going to be any Theory

1350
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:32,318
that's comprehensive enough to tell you

1351
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:35,960
everything you need to know about your

1352
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:37,679
your plant like that's just not reality

1353
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,480
and so there's always going to be some

1354
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,960
experimentation and experience necessary

1355
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,719
for you to you know really get really

1356
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,440
get there Kyle did you want to say

1357
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,519
something about that I was gonna say

1358
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,519
Socratic heretic is like how I like to

1359
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:52,318
think of myself I know enough to know

1360
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:53,679
that I don't really know anything but

1361
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,279
I'm still going to kind of do my own

1362
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,639
thing so that's what I just that's how I

1363
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,079
look at

1364
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:02,239
stuff yeah I mean yeah exactly because

1365
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,000
when when SCU was talking before I mean

1366
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:04,399
I think he's being really

1367
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,880
self-deprecating by saying he wasn't

1368
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:12,160
smart enough but I for me I think the

1369
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,680
the theory is really intimidating um and

1370
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,838
so I can see why people would be like

1371
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:19,279
look I'm just gonna work with what I

1372
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:21,920
have see how it goes you know tweak it

1373
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,798
as as it goes and I'll keep an eye on

1374
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:29,039
the theory but it's not going to

1375
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:33,239
like yeah fully informed SL overwhelming

1376
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:35,640
um yeah just want to point that out in

1377
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,358
in my opinion honestly the theory is a

1378
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:41,118
really good general guide it's nothing

1379
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:43,759
that's going to work 100% of the time

1380
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,400
all the time it's yeah you're still

1381
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,240
going to be going back and checking

1382
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,000
Small Things doing small differences

1383
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:50,479
that are going to be better suited for

1384
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,639
your needs at the

1385
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,280
time yeah and there's something else you

1386
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,639
mentioned earlier as well which is if

1387
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,680
you have the

1388
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,960
patience and time and effort to go and

1389
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:03,318
look at as many different perspectives

1390
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,838
as possible that would be very valuable

1391
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:06,440
because then you can at least compare

1392
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:08,798
and you can see where they overlap and

1393
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,358
where they don't and I'm sure that would

1394
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:14,639
be a lot more constructive than just

1395
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:16,519
like borrowing into one buying into like

1396
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:20,038
one single Theory and like committing

1397
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:20,038
everything to that that single

1398
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:26,679
Theory yeah all right I got another

1399
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:29,880
topic for us um

1400
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:31,759
pot size I heard chren mention earlier

1401
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,640
that he does beds I had a couple

1402
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,520
questions for him what size beds are you

1403
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:40,318
running in the 2x4 and uh how often are

1404
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:40,318
you re amending

1405
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:49,358
those so I have been

1406
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:52,480
uh you know attacked about it before but

1407
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:57,318
I run two by4 beds in my 2x4s

1408
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,880
essentially the entire bottom is uh is

1409
00:59:57,318 --> 01:00:04,440
soil

1410
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:09,280
um and now I do take uh like my plastic

1411
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:12,920
Solo cups that I use for uh for pots for

1412
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:17,079
seedlings and clones and stuff um I have

1413
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:19,720
those pushed behind the bed so that it

1414
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:24,240
creates like a air gap there so air can

1415
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:24,239
still be drawn through

1416
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:33,558
um yeah uh I re amend

1417
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:37,279
them when I flip I usually add about a

1418
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:42,079
cubic foot of compost or castings

1419
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,400
depending on you know if my uh if I have

1420
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,160
enough for my worm bins or anything like

1421
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,358
that

1422
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:52,920
um when I don't I usually just use you

1423
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:55,199
know like Malibu or oie Mountain either

1424
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,519
of those two just CU they're pretty

1425
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:01,838
solid and

1426
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:05,239
consistent and I add some bat guano and

1427
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:07,759
some insect frass in that top

1428
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:09,919
dress and then about two weeks later I

1429
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,319
had

1430
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:16,280
uh what's it called Soft Rock

1431
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:18,838
phosphate um just to kind

1432
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:23,079
of essentially I'm G what I what I'm

1433
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:27,639
trying to do is give it just a base of

1434
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:30,280
of food to eat um and then depending on

1435
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:32,480
where I'm at in the cycle what I'm

1436
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:37,000
adding dry amendments to kind of steer

1437
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,000
it a little bit uh for down the

1438
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,599
