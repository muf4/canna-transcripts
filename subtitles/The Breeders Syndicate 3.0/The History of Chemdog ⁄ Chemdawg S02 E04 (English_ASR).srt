everything in it coil splitting

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,439
but a really thin thin thin neck which I

24
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,118

25
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,819

so yeah I'm gonna bring natto in and uh

27
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,899
it looks like there's already 90 people

28
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,719
in here so let's get this [ __ ] jumping

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,280
what's up Keith uh props to Keith too

30
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,078
because he's the one who really uh kind

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,320
of put this in my brain today to get

32
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:44,179
this going let's see where's where's

33
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,179
my buddy here there we go

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,420
yeah this is uh Bryn's paint not mine I

35
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:55,438
don't know much about paint what's up

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,219
dude Wasabi how you doing I'm good you

37
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,779
ready to to drop the verbal pipe bomb I

38
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,438
mean you know hopefully it'll be

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,978
educational yeah we'll try to keep

40
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,139
try to keep you know facts from uh

41
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,300
educated guesses separate perhaps yeah

42
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,859
yeah I think a lot of times yeah a lot

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,160
of times those two things got get

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,040
conflated yeah you know what people know

45
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,098
versus what people think you know yeah

46
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,439
so I think that's a good idea um

47
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,639
let's see first of course like you just

48
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,500
said we'll we'll start with the

49
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,419
disclaimer a lot of this is going to be

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,520
Theory and conjecture based on educated

51
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,859
guesses based on breeding

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,980
um based on talking to pretty much

53
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,920
everyone involved in the in the Kim

54
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,719
lineage and sour lineage from from back

55
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,119
in the day till now

56
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,400
um it's it's a lot of it was put

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,459
together by CSI Humboldt you know a lot

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,500
of what what what I've I've discovered

59
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,900
and he's discovered and not so's

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,939
discovered all combined into one grand

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,860
ultimate Theory however I don't want to

62
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,419
speak for him he can always speak on his

63
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,099
own I offered him to come on here but

64
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,479
he's always too busy so

65
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,219
um it's just going to be me and not so

66
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,018
and we're going to try to cover it as

67
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,318
best we can as accurate as we can and

68
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,539
and with the best intentions because uh

69
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,878
earlier someone wrote me and it was this

70
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,500
it was around it was this morning and um

71
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,139
he was just asking you know like is it

72
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,900
what is uh you know Kim D what is what

73
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,799
is Kim a what's all this stuff and and I

74
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,019
thought about I was like there really

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,879
isn't you know one place people can go

76
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,980
as a resource to really get a good idea

77
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,079
for what these lines are what's behind

78
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,518
them in the history it's a lot of

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,500
piecing together from different Forum

80
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,939
stuff and even then there's a lot of

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,158
stuff that's just not out there because

82
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,959
people are scared to step on toes and I

83
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,818
think it's been long enough that no toes

84
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,219
should be stepped on

85
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:46,199
yeah I mean it it's also true in a lot

86
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,799
of ways where

87
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,158
um

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,780
you know uh the truth the truth survives

89
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,000
a lot better when there's when there's

90
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,158
little fame or rap or money involved

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,019
yeah because there's no reason to alter

92
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,378
it and you know as soon as anything

93
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,239
becomes you know famous or you know

94
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,399
there's money involved or whatever else

95
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,620
then all of a sudden you know

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,080
uh sometimes there's battling amongst

97
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,379
people as far as like who did what and

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,819
when and how and everything like that so

99
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,060
yeah

100
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,459
um you know it's uh yeah and cam is you

101
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,379
know Kim's this this this topic has been

102
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,899
debated now for

103
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,060
uh when did The Forum talk start Matt

104
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,500
like oh six yeah somewhere around there

105
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,540
is when people started really jumping on

106
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,819
it yeah so probably like it's been it's

107
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,300
been publicly debated now in various

108
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:39,360
ways and various you know forms for 16

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,918
years or something like that yeah

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,840
um which is pretty incredible when it

111
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,000
comes to like a bunch you know a small

112
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,179
group of like hippie kids just partying

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,879
and then all of a sudden Fame happens

114
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,220
yeah you know exactly dude so let's

115
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,360
start with uh let's start with the

116
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,320
beginning

117
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,900
the chem 91 the the dog Bud bag seed as

118
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,120
it were all right so maybe maybe I'll

119
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,279
start at not the beginning but a

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,478
beginning right and then we'll go back

121
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,819
to the beginning so uh my my start in

122
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,399
the Cannabis story as far as chem dog

123
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:18,839
goes comes in the late 90s

124
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:21,599
um I had uh I just I recently found the

125
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,959
Mendo perps us and I'd grown a couple

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,820
crops of it and I had I had a friend uh

127
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,859
who will remain nameless uh simply

128
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:30,240
because he doesn't really like Fame but

129
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,960
I've previously referred to him as

130
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,620
Staten Island uh and you know as we

131
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,779
became friends uh he gave me the camp

132
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,600
what later be was called the dog at the

133
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:44,279
time the dog and the super skunk

134
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,320
right yep

135
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,599
um and we became like really really good

136
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,180
friends for a long time and so he used

137
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,600
to tell me a bunch of the stories about

138
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,639
the chem and how all that came to be and

139
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,100
this is you know this is

140
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,460
um late 90s early 2000s as all these

141
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:07,139
stories are getting told so uh that's

142
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:08,519
kind of my aspect into the camp yeah um

143
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,819
at the time

144
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,620
other than him uh and myself he had

145
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,959
given it a couple of years previous to

146
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,720
giving it to me he had given it to uh

147
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,978
the guy who's known on here as uh skunk

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,860
VA

149
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,360
uh you'll forgive me if I if I pause for

150
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,680
a second because I'm trying to like

151
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,960
instead of just saying all these

152
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,840
people's names I'm trying to use their

153
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,519
internet handle you know yeah which is a

154
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,079
little different because you know I you

155
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,240
don't ever call them by these things in

156
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,500
person right yeah

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,000
um but you know there was a few people

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,279
there was a couple literally probably

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,579
like four or five people in the state of

160
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,719
California that had it yeah right

161
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,359
um and then

162
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:53,220
you know you can fast forward to the

163
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,139
forums uh where uh skunk VA came out and

164
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,240
sort of the chemdog 101 which Matt

165
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,038
reference began to come out and all

166
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,699
kinds of people started debating various

167
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:06,300
aspects and but for a while say from the

168
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,038
time that it was created until it's Fame

169
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,800
as it were

170
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:13,379
um you know it was really only a small

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,660
group of people they kind of had it so

172
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,699
probably the the easiest way to that to

173
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,780
say it is

174
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:24,900
um in the summer of 1991 uh the chemdog

175
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,959
was seeing some Grateful Dead shows

176
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,818
and at Grateful Dead shows I've said

177
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,459
previously it was a really great place

178
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,319
to buy kind bud uh especially in the

179
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,359
early 90s it might have been one of the

180
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,660
only consistent places

181
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,000
to buy kind bud at the time right and so

182
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,220
he was I think he was 17 years old at

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,360
the time and he bought some kind bud

184
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,300
from a guy named uh Joe brand

185
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,620
and his and his kind of his sidekick uh

186
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,579
Peabody

187
00:07:52,620 --> 00:08:00,379
right uh the story diverges right after

188
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:04,318
that because he either found

189
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:08,339
supposedly 13 seeds in that kind bud

190
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,039
or he or he got uh Peabody and Joe to

191
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,918
send him one more batch of something of

192
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,360
something yeah and he found the seeds in

193
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,639
that bud

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,280
but needless to say the reason why

195
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,960
people call it Deer Creek for younger

196
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,478
people is Deer Creek is one of the

197
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,098
venues uh in

198
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,159
um

199
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:31,680
the I'm getting confused by questions

200
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,019
tell him that Jason Kim that Jason King

201
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,719
wrote about was my cam that was my weed

202
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:40,259
I grew it and I gave him I even wrote

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,020
him out a list of what to say and it did

204
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:45,720
not make an accurate transcription into

205
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,399
the book sadly uh he took some artistic

206
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,600
license

207
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,519
um but

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:56,339
anyway uh you know so

209
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,039
um so chem dog takes it home right and

210
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,920
he has these seeds and he Sprouts four

211
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,719
or five of them or one or you know no

212
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,399
he's probably so he Sprouts a few

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:11,700
because out of that comes the chem CIS

214
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,679
and the chem 91. okay and I will say

215
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,120
about the chem CIS that my buddy from

216
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,120
Staten Island remembers it

217
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,440
yeah so you know two of them survived

218
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,259
yes of the let's put it that way of the

219
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,860
first of the first batch of seeds popped

220
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:34,740
two became named okay and the other ones

221
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,659
probably ended up getting lost

222
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,639
um everyone that I first met everyone

223
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,399
called it the dog

224
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,100
uh most of the Growers that had it um my

225
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,559
buddy from Staten Island uh skunk VA Etc

226
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,080
they were all organic Growers so they

227
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,299
weren't super hyped back then on calling

228
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,278
anything they grew chem yeah of course

229
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,139
uh and you know Americans we like to

230
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,720
shorten [ __ ] or whatever so most of us

231
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:00,778
just called it the dog yeah it was the

232
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,339
dog right and um

233
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:07,980
so You Know It uh so

234
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:12,180
chem dog had the dog and he was growing

235
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,800
the dog for a number of years uh and it

236
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:16,979
became kind of popular in the east coast

237
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,439
in certain circles and he was really

238
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,000
militant about not giving it out

239
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,300
right

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
um because he didn't want to get cut off

241
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,579
right he had yeah he had sort of a trap

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,839
Market this and that now granted you

243
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,759
know as the case may be you have to

244
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,200
realize that like at this particular

245
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:40,500
time he's you know 17 18 19 years old at

246
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,440
best yeah right uh these are Grateful

247
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,639
Dead kids right so my buddy from Staten

248
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,579
Island

249
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,259
has been trying to get it from him and

250
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:50,578
chem dog wouldn't give it to anybody on

251
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:53,700
the East Coast

252
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:56,278
okay and um

253
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,959
my buddy moved out to Sonoma County in

254
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,139
Northern California just North of San

255
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,899
Francisco and he wanted to be closer

256
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:08,039
to the Grateful Dead Jerry Garcia Jerry

257
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:10,740
band the Bay Area hippies right so he

258
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,578
left New York and

259
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,278
um

260
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,620
chem dog because dude was on the west

261
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,320
coast and 3000 miles away agreed to give

262
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,240
it to him if as long as he promised to

263
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,579
never ever give it to anyone back on the

264
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,019
East Coast yeah he didn't want it to

265
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:26,458
spread anywhere in New York or

266
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,039
Massachusetts or anything like that yeah

267
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,000
at the same time

268
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,879
um

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,458
he had this he had this weed

270
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:39,360
um that uh he smoked with these other

271
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:41,518
hippies at uh some Jerry Garcia shows uh

272
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,399
and these guys flipped out over it they

273
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,860
adored it they wanted it really bad and

274
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,559
so they said if you come to Virginia

275
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,379
right we will give you this skunk cut

276
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,039
that we have

277
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,019
and

278
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,458
um you know in exchange for this this

279
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,799
cut that you have

280
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:01,799
so dude arranged it

281
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,500
um to go to Virginia and trade uh this

282
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,219
cut for the super skunk and then he

283
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,919
drove to Massachusetts and met chemdog

284
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,440
and chemdog gave him the dog and because

285
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,919
dude had a couple extra cuts of this

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,380
skunk he gave one to chemdog and then he

287
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,179
took the super skunk and the dog and

288
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,299
drove West yeah

289
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:27,778
right that was about 1993.

290
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:30,120
yes or so no yes so that's that's kind

291
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:33,600
of that's kind of where like the the

292
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,879
West Coast kind of comes into it is he

293
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,879
brought it out to the West Coast

294
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,679
um and then that was 1993. and he was

295
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,120
pretty much the only one growing it for

296
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,679
a few years

297
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,620
either one of them on the west coast

298
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,019
actually uh nobody else had it uh so it

299
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,820
was basically like one small garage

300
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,339
and you could get either one of those

301
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,260
strains if if you happen to go to like a

302
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,180
Jerry Garcia show at The Warfield or

303
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,278
anywhere in the bay or anywhere in

304
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:02,399
California he would likely be there with

305
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,500
ounces yeah slinging ounces for 400

306
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,360
bucks an ounce right

307
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,419
uh so you fast forward a couple years

308
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,740
and uh it's 1995 and Jerry has a heart

309
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,578
attack and dies

310
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,560
and uh uh skunk VA decides to come off

311
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:18,778
dead tour

312
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,338
um and wants to grow some wheat and so

313
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,759
initially my buddy gives him the super

314
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:26,459
skunk you which is

315
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,919
um dudes taking some Polaroids and uh

316
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:32,578
he's posted them up on his IG so there's

317
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:34,620
some I think some 95 96 Polaroids and

318
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:38,578
let's let's go ahead and delineate here

319
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,980
that between start start calling it the

320
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:42,239
VA Super Skunk the one just try to refer

321
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,959
to it as that because there might be

322
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,579
other super skunks yeah sure so

323
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,219
that's the other hard part too is that

324
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:52,620
all these other terms besides dog and

325
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,360
super skunk came about on the internet

326
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,039
when people were trying to figure out

327
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,480
what the hell we had

328
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:05,699
so uh VA skunk

329
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:08,579
um Massachusetts Super Skunk chem 91 uh

330
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,259
skunk VA cut I don't think any of those

331
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:12,838
things really even existed until the

332
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,939
mid-2000s yeah yeah in terms of in terms

333
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,480
of nomenclature in terms of names yeah

334
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,540
yeah right to us it was like the SS and

335
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,620
the dog yeah yeah super skunking dog and

336
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,299
the only reason why I'm really telling

337
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,339
the super skunk thing for for a minute

338
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:27,539
is just because it ties into how home

339
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,959
you got it

340
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,699
and brought it West yeah okay so what's

341
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,439
something what someone should know is

342
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,300
that um

343
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:43,560
and uh he wasn't part of the he uh skunk

344
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:46,500
VA wasn't part of the Dead uh no

345
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:49,919
um there was a bunch of us a few hundred

346
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,198
thousand people uh that either went you

347
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,000
know that traveled around with the Dead

348
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,059
uh while there was dead shows up until

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,039
1995 and he was one of those people yeah

350
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,419
he was one of those people uh Peabody

351
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,980
was another one of those people so it

352
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,039
was Joe brand there was a lot of people

353
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,379
that went to shows and hustled various

354
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,299
things to uh

355
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:13,559
um to make it to the next show

356
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:15,240
yeah you know uh and so you know

357
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,419
um

358
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,980
and uh don't get one of the questions

359
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,599
don't get caught up in questions don't

360
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,399
get caught up in questions yeah don't

361
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,820
worry about it yeah so we'll cover them

362
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,379
so he um so he got you know so basically

363
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,760
what it boiled down to is that there was

364
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,698
one guy

365
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,899
from 1993 on that had it on the West

366
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:38,639
Coast yes right and he promised he was

367
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,480
he's always been kind of Stingy about

368
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,480
Cuts uh you know he kind of saw what was

369
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,159
coming uh you know it might have been a

370
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,899
lot of years off at that point but he

371
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,399
saw that there was a bunch of uh

372
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,860
shenanigans that was going to happen and

373
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,339
so he was always pretty militant about

374
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,899
getting trading cuts and stuff like that

375
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,079
um I didn't really trade Cuts with him I

376
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,299
just kind of by sheer accident became

377
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,039
like a super close friend of his yeah

378
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,958
and that's pretty much why I got them

379
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,819
yeah you know we just traded everything

380
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,679
back and forth because we were so close

381
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,579
right

382
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,638
um

383
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:16,500
and so uh

384
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,839
that's kind of the start now here's an

385
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,778
interesting thing my buddy from Staten

386
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,480
Island smoked both the dog and the chem

387
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:26,759
CIS back then but he didn't bring the

388
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,480
chemistus West because he thought it was

389
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,759
far inferior okay he didn't want it so

390
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,300
we know for sure that the chemcis was

391
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,759
one of the earliest Cuts oh he yes he to

392
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:41,219
my knowledge the chemists and the chem

393
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,199
dog or the dog are the two cuts that

394
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,339
came out of the first popping of seats

395
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:50,819
okay and they existed and he remembers

396
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:54,060
smoking them in you know before he moved

397
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:57,000
West in 91 92

398
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,758
um you know he you know so he I have you

399
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,980
know independent confirmation yeah right

400
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,360
that those both those things existed

401
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,640
that's that's good to know because even

402
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
I I had no clue if Ken because it's

403
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,600
always been said that Kim sis was a part

404
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,240
of the cam a through depop and that's

405
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,219
where it gets confused no he he actually

406
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,380
he and he thought it was ugly and he

407
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,240
didn't like the high makes sense and so

408
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,579
he didn't he didn't bring it West he had

409
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,000
the opportunity to bring it West

410
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:25,798
he didn't want it okay right

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,480
um you know and so that doesn't mean it

412
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,119
wasn't good or whatever it just yeah but

413
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,039
it was one dude's opinion you know but

414
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,739
it was ugly

415
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,599
um you know and it wasn't as good and so

416
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,839
you know

417
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,839
um so anyway so you know the the story

418
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,899
of Kim is that uh you know what became

419
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:49,079
known as you know chem 91 and CIS came

420
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,000
out of that first 91 seat pop yeah

421
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,480
right

422
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,339
um and uh you know it it goes off it

423
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,900
goes off on tangents because it ties

424
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,659
into sour and all these different things

425
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,100
but we can keep it yeah you know I don't

426
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,600
know we can keep it pretty close I'm

427
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,579
doing my best to not look at questions

428
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,759
but I know it's just okay and it's

429
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:10,558
cracking me it's [ __ ] hard

430
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,160
so

431
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,019
um

432
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,660
so anyway those those were those were

433
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:18,179
the first two cuts I mostly have

434
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,298
I'll say this I know a lot about what

435
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,160
happened uh on the west coast simply

436
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:25,379
because I'm good friends with him and

437
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm good and I've known the other people

438
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,799
that had it for forever now you know

439
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:35,579
yeah uh and you know we also traded a

440
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,859
ton of stories about things before the

441
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:40,019
forums really existed

442
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:42,298
yeah and before it was ever talked about

443
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,460
or before we had any idea that like

444
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:47,700
anything of this [ __ ] was going to be

445
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,259
anything important yeah either right

446
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,419
because that's what happens with a lot

447
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,038
of famous weed is that nobody has any

448
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,160
idea what they're doing is going to be

449
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,319
important or people are going to care

450
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,980
right so it's not like everyone's taking

451
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:04,678
meticulous notes in case uh they get

452
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,319
famous later yeah these are we are

453
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,179
partying hippies yeah and take smoking

454
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,399
weed we're taking LSD we're trying to

455
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,038
chase chicks we're tripping around we're

456
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,000
doing our thing circle jerking all of it

457
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:20,879
yeah that was more like I think your uh

458
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
you know so to speak but I've seen I

459
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,500
don't know to each their own so

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,480
um you know but yeah that's that's kind

461
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,880
of what and you got to remember too for

462
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,798
chem dog I mean chem dog was literally

463
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,880
17 years old when he got these [ __ ]

464
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:34,500
seats yeah

465
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,419
I don't know if anyone I don't know how

466
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,519
old everyone who's listening is but like

467
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,919
when you're 17 18 19

468
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,019
you don't have very much together

469
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,059
no the fact that dude was able to throw

470
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,819
together some lights especially in the

471
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:50,099
early 90s when there was no forums there

472
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,038
was no information there was two or

473
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:55,019
three books you could buy yeah and some

474
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,440
friends you know I mean the tech was

475
00:19:55,019 --> 00:20:00,660
pretty basic yeah it was not easy to get

476
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,340
information back then it was not easy to

477
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,558
learn like most of the time you learned

478
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,538
you did whatever someone who knew who

479
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,119
was growing around you was doing if you

480
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:12,599
knew anyone yeah I didn't know anyone so

481
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,599
I I literally started from books

482
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,399
um so you know he uh

483
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,019
yeah and it was totally illegal there

484
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,620
was no medical or anything like that

485
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:24,298
obviously but uh you know that's how it

486
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,678
started it started with with some

487
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:29,099
teenagers

488
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,500
and bag seed from a dead show

489
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:35,038
so as a result of that

490
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,460
um you know uh the what it is exactly

491
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:41,460
will will kind of be an eternal mystery

492
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,460
yeah

493
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,919
um you know and at least at this point

494
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,940
it's it's at least at this point that

495
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,980
we're speaking about it's a complete

496
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,980
mystery on what it is yeah and you know

497
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,759
and I should also say too that

498
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,279
um

499
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,720
they

500
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,879
chemdog wasn't friends with peabut or

501
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,700
Joe brand or anything like that like he

502
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,919

they bought weed off of at a dead show

505
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:12,298
or something here and there right so

506
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,460
those guys had those guys had no idea

507
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:17,279
for years and years and years that

508
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,200
anything came out of that weed sale yeah

509
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,759
like at all

510
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,480
you know

511
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,038
um

512
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,319
and so

513

there's all kind there's all kinds of

517
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,960
rumors that have come out after the fact

518
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:39,720
right yeah but the bottom line is that

519
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,360
some older Partiers Who Sold weed for a

520
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,640
living okay who are constantly buying

521
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,779
and selling different types of weed on

522
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,659
dead tour

523
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,940
sold the sack of weed one day and then

524
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,840
15 years later found out something came

525
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:57,298
of it yeah so there was no like calls

526
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,000
back like hey that thing is really

527
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,918
special what what like there wasn't any

528
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,500
kind of information exchange like that

529
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,759
going and then and and to me this is

530
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,700
where kind of like

531
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,720
um well I guess maybe let's take it

532
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,120
year by year so let's get into the uh

533
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,038
the Kim a through D then I mean or can

534
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,959
be through D I guess if Kim's sister

535
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,819
because Kim's sister is considered Kim a

536
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,220
if I remember correctly same thing I

537
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:25,859
mean it you know I

538
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,319
so I mean you can say there's there's

539
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,359
rumors I

540
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,418
I was not

541
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,759
um you know I was not obviously on the

542
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,400
east coast and all this stuff happened

543
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,679
um but I mean I you know I was I knew

544
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,380
the various people involved

545
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,600
and that's what I was told yeah um what

546
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,120
we know for sure is that two keepers

547
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,418
came out of the first batch of seeds got

548
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,639
you yeah that's what we know for sure

549
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,200
um and then let's get to so we've gone

550
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,460
on about the 91 we haven't really said

551
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,380
about what we think it is or anything

552
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,919
we'll do that at the end

553
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:06,179
um let's do the the the D era

554
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:09,240
okay so fast forward nine years nine

555
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,500
years nine years okay right

556
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,779
um and maybe

557
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,400
God I should

558
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,798
I mean we have well I guess we'll just

559
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,780
Bounce Around in time fast forward nine

560
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,538
years and

561
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,099
um he's got some seeds and he decides to

562
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:24,839
pop some more seeds

563
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:27,359
okay

564
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,759
um any labels them whatever you know a b

565
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,038
c d e you know so on and so forth yeah

566
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,440
and it seems like the one true keeper

567
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:37,259
that came out of that was the D yeah

568
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,980
okay so

569
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,919
um

570
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,220
so there was the D right and at this

571
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,659
point the story has has been that he

572
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,120
found males and that he didn't find

573
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:50,159
males based on what post you refer to

574
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,658
and this yeah like a lot of things I've

575
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,600
said before I mean there's there's

576
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,400
issues with chem dog in the sense that

577
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,038
um not all of the things he has written

578
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,140
on the forums can all be true yeah yeah

579
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,599
you know I'm not saying he's a liar

580
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,820
because yeah I'm just saying that like

581
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,279
your recollection and this year versus

582
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:10,139
how you write it in that year and all

583
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,480
that type of stuff you know and what you

584
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,480
were doing and if you remember right

585
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,700
yeah um because you know I mean Matt you

586
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,220
know Matt we've we've uh We've chatted

587
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,080
with some very old school cats and some

588
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,819
of them have very poor memory on what

589
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,939
they were up to yeah that's for sure

590
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,859
that seems to be consistent among most

591
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,019
older heads yeah none of them knew it

592
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,538
was going to be famous or matter or need

593
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,879
to remember yeah or need to remember so

594
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:38,400
basically at this point we should say

595
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,100
that I'm not exactly sure when the sis

596
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,240
died yeah let's just say that there was

597
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:48,359
the the dog AKA chem 91 and then there

598
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:52,500
was the CIS yes and then there was the D

599
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:54,839
yeah so by 2000 there was

600
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,179
um there was three cuts

601
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,740
okay

602
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:01,620
and uh

603
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:05,220
um you know fast forward uh five or six

604
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:07,678
more years and skunk VA gets on the

605
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,058
forums Matt would probably remember was

606
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,740
it I see mag

607
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:13,500
I don't remember which one he popped up

608
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,740
on I think he popped up on the forums

609
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,240
talking [ __ ] about uh Cam and this and

610
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,120
that and everything else and that's kind

611
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,759
of where the skunk VA cut came from sure

612
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,759
the name because a lot of times back

613
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,798
then you attributed a cut to the name of

614
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,960
the poster who first talked about the

615
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,558
cut correct and it was super common

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,759
right yeah that was a very common

617
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:38,579
nomenclature way of talking about things

618
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,440
right yeah so

619
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,319
um

620
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,500
you know and then the I mean you know

621
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,939
there's uh so anyway so it gets it

622
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,000
starts to get famous

623
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,320
okay and other people realize it gets

624
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,619
famous

625
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,019
um and you know uh obviously skunk VA

626
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,899
kind of started the fame uh chem dog

627
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,819
gets back involved he realizes that

628
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,100
there's a bunch of stuff going on about

629
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,439
his stories I believe he started posting

630
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,339
some versions of his events right around

631
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,460
then

632
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,918
and somehow uh Peabody and Joe brand

633
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,360
find out it's going on and recently just

634
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,100
so so everybody knows like they're

635
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,538
talking about Joe brand I recently

636
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:20,879
talked to Joe brand and we're going to

637
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:23,700
do an interview but we've been having

638
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,059
um trouble like linking up the times to

639
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,819
do it so this is being told with his uh

640
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:31,619
input in it basically so when we get to

641
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,240
the one through four I'll start talking

642
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,859
more about from his point of view how it

643
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,740
went down as well so what I believe

644
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:40,558
happened is uh

645
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,019
um you know they uh these people started

646
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,298
talking back and forth and this was the

647
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,579
first indication to Peabody and Joe

648
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:50,278
brand that something had happened to

649
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,379
some weed that they sold 15 16 years

650
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,679
before yeah right

651
00:26:52,380 --> 00:27:00,240
so and this year's

652
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:03,900
2006 2006 right yeah and so

653
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,880
um Joe and chemdog start chatting or

654
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,440
dming or whatever the hell

655
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,260

656
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,259
chemdog decides to give them Force give

657
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,179
Joe brand four seats yes and they were

658
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,460
even they even named them the reunion

659
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,200
seats that's correct yeah because it was

660
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,319
The Reunion because it was the first

661
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,200
time these various characters had

662
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:28,439
started chatting again correct after 15

663
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,600
16 years of not talking yeah right and

664
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,820
so they were supposed to be four seats

665
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,619
from the original bad was how the story

666
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:37,019
went the story went there were four

667
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,538
seeds from the original band so they got

668
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:42,538
popped and they got creatively named one

669
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:44,220
through four since it was already a3d

670
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:46,558
let's do one thing yeah they were they

671
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,919
were named one through four yeah

672
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,960
um so you know uh The Forum era was a

673
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,580
little bit different era in the sense

674
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,240
that things were starting to get traded

675
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,319
around a little bit more

676
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,400
different grows and different things

677
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:04,619
like that and like I said my uh

678
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,679
um my buddy who brought the Clones out

679
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,719
here was real stingy about trading cuts

680
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,538
and especially

681
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,220
um especially that and so uh chem dog

682
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:17,158
had made him promise to not really give

683
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,700
it out beyond the tight Circle and so he

684
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,860
kind of held to that yeah right

685
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,080
um you know uh

686
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,000
so but then obviously there's a bunch of

687
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,579
desire for it

688
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,619
right yeah and so I don't know where we

689
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:34,439
want to go from here

690
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:36,058
um but uh

691
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,640
that's well I mean that's the rough

692
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:41,658
story as it was told that's the rough

693
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:47,038
story so as it was originally told now

694
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:51,179
aka dog ak-91 yeah right uh chem CIS

695
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:53,819
those are the 91 pop okay some things

696
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,740
were popped in 2000 of that the D

697
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:57,960
survived and became known and famous

698
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,200
yeah and then some more things one

699
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,058
through four were popped in 2006. yes

700
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,980
and those also became named and those

701
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:07,440
also those also started getting traded

702
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,079
and this is where the story kind of

703
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,460
where where we ended up with the story

704
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,240
when all of us started kind of

705
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,278
researching it pretty hard is is from

706
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,960
taking that story that we were told that

707
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,419
they were all from the same bag of seeds

708
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,819
and then growing them and over the years

709
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,278
you know whether me you Caleb everyone

710
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:28,019
started collecting these cuts and

711
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:31,140
growing them out and seeing how that

712
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:32,339
compared to the tail and that's where

713
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,580
everything kind of starts getting

714
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:37,798
figured out uh over the years um from

715
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,898
Joe Brown to what he had as the Kim one

716
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:41,819
through four what thought he really was

717
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:43,259
I'll answer this question even though

718
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,298
you're telling me to ignore it the Joe

719
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:48,599
brand cut

720
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:51,778
um came because uh

721
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:54,178
Joe Joe Brown was a is it was I don't

722
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:55,798
know if he is was a hard partier

723
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,899
right let's just let's just put it that

724
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:59,639
way he liked to get high he liked to

725
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:00,959
party he liked to party on a wide

726
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,960
variety of stuff

727
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,960
and he traded people

728
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,200
um after he got a hold of the chem 91 he

729
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:15,079
traded from IC Collective correct uh no

730
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:19,580
yes hold on no no no no

731
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:22,619
so it gets it gets confusing okay

732
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:25,019
from Joe's point of view but uh but I'll

733
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:27,418
but I'll I'll go back to that so what

734
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:31,139
became known as the as the Joe brand cut

735
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:34,740
is Joe ended up the JB cam he started

736
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,720
trading people okay the chem 91 for

737
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:41,640
various cuts

738
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,278
and lo and behold it wasn't the chem 91.

739
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,020
so he sent people

740
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:49,079
you know some people call it the Joe B

741
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:54,359
diesel some people call it the Joe B Kem

742
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:55,678
uh it was obviously maybe a a JB 91

743
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:57,778
um that's what I'm referring to though

744
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,940
he got the cut that he was trading from

745
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:02,579
Icy Collective that's how it's not

746
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,640
accordingly okay so so here here's where

747
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:07,259
we'll go so I also know I see Collective

748
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,960
um and he has a different version of

749
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:11,579
events yeah so let's tell both so that's

750
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,860
so why don't you why don't you tell

751
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,599
Joe's version okay so Joe's version is

752
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:19,678
that um when he tried to get back the

753
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:22,139
cuts he went to IC Collective and I see

754
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,019
collectives sent him back cam a version

755
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,520
of Cam 91 that he thought that he may or

756
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,200
may not have known was the real one and

757
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,898
Joe brand immediately started passing it

758
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,880
out and trading it out

759
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:37,319
so uh could be could be um his uh I see

760
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,360
Collective story is not that much

761
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,579
different than that okay so I see

762
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,158
Collective story is that

763
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,319
um he lived in Oakland at the time uh

764
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,640
and he'd been in Tahoe and stuff too but

765
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,778
he

766
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,240
um

767
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:52,220
he had Joe brand and Peabody come out to

768
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,798
his house

769
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,659
okay and that was the first time it was

770
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:00,658
an OS it was it was a little bit after

771
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,700
06 I think it was right around that era

772
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:04,860
um but that was the first time that

773
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,120
Peabody and Joe brand smoked the chem

774
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:09,359
91.

775
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:11,158
yeah was at his house then they had

776
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,219
never seen it they they made they

777
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,620
obviously had smoked or seen the dog bud

778
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,940
or whatever the seeds came out of but

779
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,759
that was the first time they ever saw

780
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,919
the famous cut yeah okay and they had

781
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,079
the one through four

782
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,759
um and uh

783
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,859
they have the one through four and they

784
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,919
wanted to trade him

785
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:34,979
um the D and the 91 for the one through

786
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,278
four yeah and he said no

787
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,380
and he gave them the D but he would not

788
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,140
give them the 91.

789
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,480
okay now this actually I actually kind

790
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,399
of believe his version of Events maybe

791
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,200
I'll maybe I'll rewind a little bit so

792
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,759
because someone just asked where did I

793
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,759
see Collective get it

794
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,679
we all got it huh you already said that

795
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,359
I mean we're not paying attention we all

796
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,278
got we all got it from the same we all

797
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,959
got it from Staten Island yeah he's the

798
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,099
one that brought it West

799
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,399
um uh skunk VA got it I would say in not

800
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:11,219
96-ish or something like that uh IC got

801
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,479
it in 97ish when he graduated from high

802
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,538
school

803
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,700
um I got it in 98-ish

804
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:19,440
um so you know and that was kind of

805
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,380
where it stopped

806
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,220
so there was four people by night late

807
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,880
90s that had it in California right

808
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,980
um

809
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,179
so

810
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,360
um had to get the chem 91 somewhere

811
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:40,380
so that so I so I know where he got it

812
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,418
okay so Piva and Joe brain were pissed

813
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:48,059
that I I see would not give it to him

814
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:50,100
okay okay so they go to our homie CSI

815
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:52,980
and that's they gave him the one through

816
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:54,719
the four okay because they were like The

817
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,000
Originators

818
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,179
of you know or part of the original

819
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,440
story yeah they got

820
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:05,580
our buddy to give them the 91.

821
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,700
then they would have had the original

822
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:11,579
91. they did have the original 91. they

823
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:15,378
got it from Caleb 100 and Caleb and

824
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:15,378
Caleb he's told me that himself

825
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,519
but you have to realize I know you're

826
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,800
you're just think okay now I'm gonna say

827
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,898
this like you know Joe used to struggle

828
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,599
I'm uh and I'm not judging him on this

829
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:30,838
but no no yeah he used to he at that

830
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:35,460
time uh he did a lot of opiates yeah

831
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:37,440
yeah okay so he got the 91. he somehow

832
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,460
lost the 91.

833
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:46,559
and started sending out mislabeled 91 in

834
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:49,440
traits so yeah so so he puts the onus on

835
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:52,320
on um IC Collective but reality may have

836
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,260
been just a mislabel

837
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,420
the reality the reality is is that from

838
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,859
what I see told me and I don't see any

839
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,200
reason to doubt him he said he

840
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:03,960
absolutely would not give him the cut

841
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,118
well yeah and then he definitely aside

842
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,659
and then CSI told me he absolutely did

843
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,700
give him the cut okay so I I kind of

844
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:14,519
think that's how they got the cut yeah I

845
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:18,118
don't make the most sense I don't know

846
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:21,179
uh I don't know how long

847
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,300
uh Joe brand had the real 91 before he

848
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:25,799
lost it but when he started trading

849
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,200
people and that was that was like my

850
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,060
buddy from Staten Island uh and other

851
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,618
people's worst fear is they didn't want

852
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:35,519
people to start trade baiting it all

853
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:38,760
over yeah which is exactly what Joe B

854
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:41,579
and t-bud started to do yes except for

855
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,099
everyone that got the dog from those

856
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,440
guys didn't get the dog and you know

857
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,440
what we didn't even realize how how off

858
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,659
that was until I think our first real

859
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,940
inkling of of what had happened there

860
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:55,440
was when Bodhi started making crosses

861
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,780
with

862
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,159
um the 88 G13 hash plant and then that's

863
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,740
when people were like wait what is this

864
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,960
cut what is this weird cut so you get

865
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:06,899
you get into this thing obviously where

866
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,300
you know okay so you have you have Joe

867
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,820
Brandon Peabody's version and then you

868
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,920
have IC Collective his his memory of it

869
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,740
and then you have Caleb's memory of it

870
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,480
right yeah but what we know for a fact

871
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:20,039
is that these Cuts started getting

872
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,820
traded around amongst this little group

873
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,019
that's how I see and Caleb got the one

874
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,720
through the four

875
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:29,280
yeah right whether it was from IC or

876
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,019
whether it was from Caleb or whether it

877
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,900
was

878
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:36,599
they had it for a brief time yeah he

879
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,180
lost it somehow

880
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,000
um but he either was scamming people or

881
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:44,219
just had a mislabeled mom and was and

882
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,260
had just gotten it and was trading it to

883
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,419
all kinds of people for whatever else he

884
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,859
wanted to get for his garden yeah so he

885
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,539
was blowing it out there so maybe some

886
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:53,400
people got the real dog

887
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:57,239
and then later on people started getting

888
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,680
what became known as the JB cut yeah you

889
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,479
know and then people are trying to

890
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:03,480
figure out what the hell the JB cut is

891
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,980
and it's like JB maybe new or maybe

892
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,039
didn't know that he was giving out a

893
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,139
fake cut yeah so that's where you know

894
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,338
so if you guys aren't paying attention

895
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:12,719
just go back and watch it we're not

896
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:14,039
answering questions right now don't even

897
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,618
look at him not so

898
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,980
so anyway

899
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:22,200
um you know according to uh you know and

900
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,699
yeah I mean that's you know the my

901
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,858
understanding of it some people call the

902
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:28,139
JB chem but

903
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:30,838
um I see Collective said it was a diesel

904
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,699
type and a shitty diesel type yeah it

905
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:36,179
wasn't as good as maybe it was a diesel

906
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:37,799
bag seat or something along those lines

907
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:39,059
um you know and so there's this thing

908
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,619
where

909
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,239
um you know this stuff ended friendships

910
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,519
in a way like there's there's people

911
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,159
that I've mentioned that don't talk to

912
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,500
one another because of ego around this

913
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,259
cut yes you know

914
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,019
um to this day uh you know our buddy CSI

915
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,820
he didn't give it out forever and I

916
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:58,980
think he waited even something like 10

917
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,880
years before he started publicly selling

918
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,119
seeds yeah after he got it and he still

919
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,940
gets gets Flack for it yeah or whatever

920
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,619
so it seems like

921
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,420
um what happened is so now you've got

922
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,858
just so everybody knows you've got the

923
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,159
chem 91

924
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:19,019
you've got the CIS you've got the D and

925
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,598
you've got the one through the four yeah

926
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:24,059
so you've got seven

927
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,000
actual chem cuts

928
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,338
Cuts okay I'm circling that family and

929
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,739
if you include the super skunk amazing

930
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:34,259
I'm just talking about like what

931
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:36,239
supposedly came from the 13 seats okay

932
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,980
we're just limiting to that we're not

933
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,819
getting into any of its children or any

934
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,420
[ __ ] like that right so

935
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,980
um

936
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,380
you know so there's so there's a

937
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,500
situation there where

938
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,960
um you know we uh and the how we got

939
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,960
maybe I should say this how we got the D

940
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,519
is that in o6 when all this stuff was

941
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,099
happening

942
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,019
um chem dog didn't know no longer have

943
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,900
the dog

944
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:06,179
and he hadn't had it for a long time

945
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,240
um but when it started getting famous

946
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:10,559
and skunk VA started getting rep for

947
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,679
having this cut

948
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,900
he wanted it back

949
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,338
right yeah he wanted to have the cut

950
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,920
that everybody was talking about again

951
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:22,799
he hadn't had it in a long time right so

952
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,358
scum VA flies out to back east

953
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,579
and

954
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,519
um gives it to chem dog gives the dog

955
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,880
back to chem dog and he gets the D in

956
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:35,219
exchange and he comes back to California

957
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:38,160
and that's how me and I see Collective

958
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:42,899
and some others all got it yeah was dude

959
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,858
brought the D back yeah okay so

960
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,260
um

961
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:48,480
yeah you know I mean and and so now

962
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,599
there's so those are I think those are

963
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,300
like the the the basic facts of it yes

964
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,220
you know well um that's the basic human

965
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,560
story of it that's the basic human story

966
00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:00,299
of it okay is that there was a couple

967
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,880
cuts from 91

968
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,420
uh that survived there was one cut from

969
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,220
2000 that survived and there was

970
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,000
um there's two cuts from o6 that

971
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:14,939
survived yes uh the one and the four are

972
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,480
still alive and verified the two and the

973
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,338
three seem to be gone they're dead yeah

974
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,960
um there's been some fake threes that

975
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:23,519
have popped up

976
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,559
um it's one of the issues with when

977
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,599
things that didn't get traded around so

978
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,578
much and they're only held by a few

979
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,980
people you know and some of those people

980
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:35,039
aren't the most responsible types

981
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:38,579
um accidents happen uh and so what we

982
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:41,219
have today as far as I know is the real

983
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:44,760
91 is alive yeah

984
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:47,159
the sis is dead dead and there are some

985
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,800
s1s that came from the CIS but the CIS

986
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:53,399
is dead uh that's what chem dog told me

987
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:57,599
and I no one seems to have it so yeah

988
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:00,358
um so of the of the 91 of the 91 pop the

989
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,000
91 is the only one that exists yeah of

990
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:06,480
the 2000 pop the D is the only thing

991
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,659
that exists yeah and of the 06 Pop

992
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,260
um the one and the four both exist yeah

993
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:14,759
right and out of that obviously there's

994
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,000
things we haven't talked about yet like

995
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,220
s1s and children of it and hybrids and

996
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,300
so on and so forth

997
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:23,879
um

998
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:28,019
you know uh

999
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,420
uh you know so I don't know I mean

1000
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,759
you know that's kind of that's kind of

1001
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,920
the as far as I know

1002
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,660
um there's you know

1003
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,260
there's four there's four living

1004
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:43,500
original Kim cuts okay so now let's go

1005
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,119
back to what we think they actually are

1006
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,559
because I mean I think this is what most

1007
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,300
people want to know

1008
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,000
um we all know the stories we've all

1009
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,440
heard that same rough same story uh

1010
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
maybe with a little additions between

1011
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,220
different people's points of view for a

1012
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,320
long time so now we've got to figure out

1013
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:01,199
what the [ __ ] are these things what was

1014
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,240
the dog bud what was uh what likely was

1015
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,819
it you know so let's talk about that

1016
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:08,759
some of some of what uh so that's the

1017
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,039
that's so the

1018
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,980
the aspect around someone's talking

1019
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,619
three CSI doesn't have three no he

1020
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,358
doesn't shut up you know Matt Matt and I

1021
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,800
are both really good friends with you he

1022
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:22,920
definitely does he definitely does not

1023
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,940
have it he had it at one point a long

1024
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,280
time ago

1025
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,260
um he had it at one point so you know

1026
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,320
what's what's the best of them uh that's

1027
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,599
preference based I suppose uh no

1028
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,400
questions yeah I will I will just I will

1029
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,039
just say my personal preference I think

1030
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,119
the dog and the D are two of my all-time

1031
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:45,119
favorite Cuts NATO likes the D and um

1032
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:48,420
you like to deal a lot I you know I do I

1033
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,338
do it's it's in it's in my talk it's in

1034
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,079
my top just the tip

1035
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:53,940
um you know and whenever I show people

1036
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,800
the D they're impressed by it are they

1037
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,079
impressed by it they are

1038
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,579
you know they are impressed by it you

1039
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,560
know so let's talk about let's talk

1040
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,440
about the 91 what what was your theories

1041
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,559
on 91 so

1042
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,559
um

1043
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:12,440
my theory on 91 is that we will never

1044
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,300
ever ever know

1045
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,460
what the hell it is

1046
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,260
um the only thing that possibly offers

1047
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,920
us an opportunity

1048
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:26,400
uh is some kind of genetic testing

1049
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,920
but it comes from so long ago that I

1050
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,800
wonder if you'd even be able to compare

1051
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,599
it to anything yeah I can't imagine that

1052
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,859
comparing it to you'd have to compare

1053
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,680
something and there's nothing to compare

1054
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:40,338
it to for about so so you just so let's

1055
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,379
put it this way right like I said before

1056
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:46,199
lots of people were on dead tour selling

1057
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,220
everything from burritos grilled cheese

1058
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:52,019
LSD corduroy pants clothes everything

1059
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:54,000
you could imagine to make money to stay

1060
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:56,940
on dead tour and to go see shows and to

1061
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,760
have a good time and to enjoy life right

1062
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:02,159
Joe brand and Peabody were some of the

1063
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,020
people that bought and sold weed on dead

1064
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:05,940
tour

1065
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:07,920
okay so they were constantly imagine

1066
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,858
you're on dead tour for several months

1067
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,200
right just and there was three tours a

1068
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:15,480
year you know spring summer fall right

1069
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,338
so you're on dead tour you're buying

1070
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,960
you're buying pounds of weed you're

1071
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:21,119
breaking them down into ounces and

1072
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,579
quarters and half ounces or whatever and

1073
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,380
you're slinging them yeah somewhere

1074
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,380
amongst the Sea of weed that these guys

1075
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,119
sold over the years one sack became

1076
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,858
famous

1077
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,858
they don't remember [ __ ]

1078
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,680
right like they never even knew that

1079
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:43,019
imagine imagine somebody came up to you

1080
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:45,358
when you were a teenager and was like

1081
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:46,920
Hey dude 15 years ago you sold me some

1082
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,659
weed

1083
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,519
and I got some really good [ __ ] out of

1084
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:53,279
it yeah

1085
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,539
right I mean maybe if you only sold one

1086
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,040
or two strains because that's what you

1087
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:58,199
grew you'd know but these guys weren't

1088
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:01,318
these guys weren't Growers they were

1089
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:03,480
Brokers yeah they bought weed and they

1090
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:05,639
took it on tour and they sold eights and

1091
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,559
quarters and a half ounces in Zips to

1092
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,139
pay their way and to eat and have fun

1093
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,139
and travel and whatnot right

1094
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:14,818
so anybody saying that like oh we think

1095
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:17,279
it comes from the Skelly or we think it

1096
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:19,380
comes from this or we think uh it comes

1097
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,720
from the puck or we think that's all

1098
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,358
super conjecture it's all super stupid

1099
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:26,699
in my opinion I know yes I've seen it

1100
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,159
too I'll say this

1101
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:32,159
um nothing that not the dog itself the

1102
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:35,699
chem itself and none of its progeny look

1103
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,838
like the puck it to me if people have a

1104
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,818
problem understanding that it's because

1105
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:40,199
they don't have a basic understanding of

1106
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:42,000
afghanis like there are so many

1107
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:44,279
different types of afghanis and it

1108
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,219
doesn't it doesn't ever throw Puck

1109
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,859
Thanos never a hash plant is so much

1110
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:53,759
different than 1091 and I've seen so

1111
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:56,460
lots and lots of phenos of ha of hash

1112
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,000
plant children yeah and none of them

1113
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:02,338
look like the dog yeah none none of them

1114
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,800
look like the dog so I I have so here we

1115
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,299
have you know I gave a basic outline of

1116
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,560
the story that there's a bunch of [ __ ]

1117
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,318
going on

1118
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,239
right and uh and now we get into the

1119
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,719
conjecture part right yeah the

1120
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:18,479
conjecture part is like is

1121
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:21,480
there's an aspect where you sometimes

1122
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,960
the plants tell you what's going on

1123
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,179
right uh and you know I've spent

1124
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,880
countless hours

1125
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:30,779
trying to figure out uh what's what's in

1126
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,338
the dog

1127
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,859
okay

1128
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:36,059
um and by breeding with it it gives you

1129
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:40,019
some Clues

1130
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:42,179
okay so uh CSI and I

1131
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:45,780
um both think that there's a good chance

1132
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:48,358
that it is literally an S1 or a bag seed

1133
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,700
yeah and the reason we think that is

1134
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:54,358
because when he s-1s it

1135
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:57,179
and he sells s1s it doesn't have a very

1136
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:59,639
wide genetic base

1137
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:01,559
right yeah it it throws a lot of

1138
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,818
different types of potency but it

1139
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:06,000
doesn't really throw a lot of different

1140
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:07,440
types of looks correct correct you know

1141
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,579
um the other thing too is that you know

1142
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:15,059
the puck is short and squat and uh very

1143
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:17,400
branchy uh the dog is very tall and

1144
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:18,900
lanky they are totally two different

1145
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,940
types of Bud structures completely

1146
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,818
completely different plant structure

1147
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,980
completely different budge structure uh

1148
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:27,960
totally different Leaf structure a

1149
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,639
little bit different terpenes

1150
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,159
um you know I think honestly it's like

1151
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:33,719
people are trying to shoehorn what it

1152
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:37,920
could be

1153
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:40,078
you know yeah um into what it is so one

1154
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,599
thing I've noticed about trying to

1155
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,579
figure out parentage over time the best

1156
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,680
way I've ever found to do it and it's

1157
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:49,260
not always it doesn't always work so

1158
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:52,078
this is just a general way of speaking

1159
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,560
but for chem 91 we're having no idea of

1160
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,539
the parentage it holds true is when you

1161
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:00,599
S1 it you're going to see those parental

1162
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:02,460
phenos you're gonna see them and it

1163
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,280
kicks fenos that have the same bud

1164
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:08,940
structure in some of its progeny in the

1165
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:12,240
s1s that look like sour and sour to me

1166
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,960
is a typical Superstar type structure so

1167
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,699
at some point in its history it's either

1168
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,639
a pure [ __ ] Afghan tea that ended up

1169
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:23,219
over here an Afghan T hybrid or a super

1170
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,838
skunk hybrid in my opinion

1171
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:27,899
um yeah so

1172
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:29,818
what I can say about the like let's

1173
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:33,660
start this this way what I can say about

1174
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:35,818
the the dog is that by modern standards

1175
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,460
it's not particularly pretty correct

1176
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:42,900
yeah it's not particularly Frosty

1177
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:45,659
it's kind of dark yep um and by looking

1178
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:49,500
at it you would think it looks way

1179
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:53,759
midsier than most modern wheat yes but

1180
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:56,579
it has super rare potency yeah so as far

1181
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,000
as effect it's an absolute champ

1182
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:02,519
you know it can taste good uh it can

1183
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,960
taste really good yeah um it can also

1184
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,420
taste just okay

1185
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,159
the potency is almost always there it's

1186
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,838
really really hard to mess up the

1187
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:10,500
potency

1188
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,139
um

1189
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,858
you know and so

1190
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:16,199
um

1191
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:18,000
you know we and and you know and so

1192
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,578
these name games happen right like I

1193
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,338
just mentioned some [ __ ] so the the the

1194
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:29,039
the the chem dog has gone from chem dog

1195
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:32,639
to dog to skunk VA cut to to chem to

1196
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:34,920
chem 91 yeah the super skunk cut my

1197
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,879
buddy got in Virginia has gone by Super

1198
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:41,220
Skunk it's gone by mass Super Skunk

1199
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,200
western Mass Super Skunk it's gone by

1200
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:45,358
Skunk six

1201
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,539
um and it may only be two of those

1202
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:51,059
things it may only be super skunk and

1203
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:52,619
skunk six and western Mass Superstar

1204
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:55,199
might have been Antonio I mean I can say

1205
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,358
that you know my buddy who picked it up

1206
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,179
uh the guy told him it was super skunk

1207
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:03,179
yeah it said super skunk on the label

1208
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:07,078
and later on we talked to the person who

1209
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:09,779
read it by our friend Johnny here and he

1210
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,599
said that it was a super skunk hybrid of

1211
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,280
sorts basically what it sounded like is

1212
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,338
he was another kind of rainbow hippie

1213
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:20,339
type dude and he had some various skunks

1214
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:20,940
that he had gotten from Neville uh you

1215
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:23,699
know

1216
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,858
um and maybe sssc and he was crossing

1217
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,598
them back and forth to each other and

1218
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:30,659
the final thing he did was he crossed

1219
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,519
that hybrid he had into Super Skunk yeah

1220
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:34,920
and that's what became known as the

1221
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:39,300
super skunk that is probably like uh

1222
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:42,180
ital said earlier probably in sour as a

1223
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,280
chem 91 hybrid I mean I I believe

1224
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:46,799
strongly that it is I believe it that's

1225
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,740
I believe I have and I I mean I have I

1226
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,720
have some I don't have exact evidence

1227
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:54,358
um I have some pretty strong evidence I

1228
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,818
think yeah but so

1229
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,139
so there you go I mean now we have now

1230
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:00,599
we have

1231
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:04,818
that's kind of the story

1232
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,818
um and You Know It uh

1233
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,200
you know there's conjecture what I will

1234
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:13,500
say is that

1235
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:18,539
I find it very hard to believe that the

1236
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:20,900
chemsis the chem 91 the D and the one

1237
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:23,400
and the four all came from the same

1238
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,920
hybrid yeah

1239
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,500
they're different enough that it's that

1240
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,260
there it seems to me uh this is where

1241
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:34,440
this is where it would be amazing to

1242
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,839
have actual like human style DNA

1243
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,119
analysis yeah where you you know that

1244
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:42,000
was the big hope of uh the company that

1245
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,280
won't be named uh his is that they would

1246
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,318
be able to you know take these

1247
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,480
long-running things and clear up these

1248
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,599
family relationships

1249
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,900
um so far that isn't the case

1250
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,818
um you know I believe that uh

1251
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,139
you know these things the thing is is

1252
00:51:56,818 --> 00:52:00,420
that people are talking about can we

1253
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:03,000
talk about some new stuff Chasing Ghosts

1254
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,119
these aren't ghosts uh these things are

1255
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,960
some of the backbones of modern cannabis

1256
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,358
of what we're going to be talking about

1257
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,380
from the beginning anyways like yeah you

1258
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,739
know

1259
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:17,700
um so you know they're and you know and

1260
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:19,500
and back in the 90s especially in 1991

1261
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:22,078
um there wasn't very many seed companies

1262
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:25,079
there wasn't as nearly as many places to

1263
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,640
get things so what it comes down to is

1264
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,019
you know

1265
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:29,519
um a lot of these things that came out

1266
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,559
in the 90s

1267
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,900
um became the backbone and even if you

1268
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:36,059
don't recognize them or have never had

1269
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,700
them you've probably had tons of things

1270
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,740
that they're in yeah

1271
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:41,699
and let me let me throw this in there

1272
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:45,479
too

1273
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:47,460
so what when I when I when I research

1274
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,099
stuff I break things down I try to use

1275
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,900
like a logic tree like from you know

1276
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:53,280
philosophy logic like you know you learn

1277
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,940
in college

1278
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,519
um

1279
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:59,639
and we're still all starting on this

1280
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:01,619
premise that this guy that we know that

1281
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,699
sells weed

1282
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:07,260
that was running low on weed went home

1283
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:08,399
kept some weed for a guy he had only met

1284
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,099
once

1285
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,500
and sent him the same exact weed that he

1286
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:15,780
smoked in Colorado or wherever it was it

1287
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,179
that he had smoked it it sent him back

1288
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,740
the last of that weed and the weed that

1289
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:22,618
he gave him the first time didn't have

1290
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:24,779
any seeds the bag of weed that he had at

1291
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:27,780
home didn't have any seeds but somehow

1292
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:30,300
that bad that Kim dog got had 13 seeds

1293
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,359
in it so there's a lot of a lot of room

1294
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,460
for human error in all of this you know

1295
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,500
um so we've got to start it is a faulty

1296
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,880
premise from the beginning and and if

1297
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,239
you try to break it down logically

1298
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,818
you're like oh yeah yeah Joe Brandon

1299
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:47,459
Peabody were dudes in their 20s selling

1300
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:49,980
weed to a teenager yeah

1301
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,539
you know yeah I mean that's kind of and

1302
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,000
then dude smoked the weed and they found

1303
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:56,039
some seeds you know

1304
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,559
um I uh

1305
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,779
so this is where we get together this is

1306
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,300
where we'll get to conjecture yeah right

1307
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,619
and we'll mix some conjecture with facts

1308
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,180
but this isn't I I said everything

1309
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,500
before and it was kind of basic because

1310
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:11,039
I just wanted to kind of give the

1311
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:14,219
timeline of of back of fact yeah that's

1312
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,259
generally accepted right so now we can

1313
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:19,318
kind of go into what we think

1314
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:22,559
is in this stuff yeah um

1315
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:27,900
so I tend to think

1316
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:29,880
um and CSI backs me up is um is that

1317
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:34,019
most of the stuff out there

1318
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:37,680
are hybrids of the dog or hybrids of

1319
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:39,480
chem 91 yes right

1320
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:44,179
um so

1321
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,179
you know uh when I

1322
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:48,960
people don't know this very well but and

1323
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,260
I don't this isn't an insult don't take

1324
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,039
this the wrong way but after

1325
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,900
um after my buddy had given chemdog the

1326
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:01,500
super skunk the super skunk was

1327
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,240
legendary for herming yeah okay so in

1328
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,960
1994

1329
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:06,838
um

1330
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:10,019
in 1994 uh

1331
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:13,078
the super skunk had hermed all over uh

1332
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:16,318
chem dog [ __ ] yeah and chem dog called

1333
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:18,660
up my buddy in California and was raving

1334
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:21,599
about these hybrids

1335
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:23,519
that he had found after the Super Skunk

1336
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,280
could accidentally pollinated the dog

1337
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,019
and and just to inject this here this is

1338
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:32,519
where I Think Jesus was born in this

1339
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:35,039
General and he so he he loved it so much

1340
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,780
and granted he's only you know 18 19 at

1341
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:39,300
the time or whatever yeah

1342
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,420
um he loved it so much he started

1343
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:47,220
growing these hybrids exclusively

1344
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:48,960
instead of the dog yeah in 1994. okay

1345
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,539
um and so

1346
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,980
this is the weed that he was selling and

1347
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:56,579
this is the weed that was getting passed

1348
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,559
out that dudes were collecting seeds

1349
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:01,440
from

1350
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,980
yeah okay that they later popped

1351
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,440
and that became diesel one and two yeah

1352
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,940
and then something in their room hermed

1353
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,099
again

1354
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,838
and of those seeds people found what

1355
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:14,640
became sour

1356
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:17,279
yeah

1357
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,719
right uh there's a there's a there's a

1358
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,160
bunch of there's a bunch of [ __ ]

1359
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,139
that goes along with that or whatever

1360
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:25,739
but that's

1361
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:28,019
um you know uh it's hard because you

1362
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:29,939
know people like you know klopp uh who's

1363
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:32,039
definitely involved in the sour and

1364
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,858
everything like that yeah at the time

1365
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:36,599
you know uh chem dog and my buddy from

1366
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:39,058
Staten Island swears that no one else on

1367
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:40,800
the East Coast had it yeah

1368
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:42,780
he wouldn't give it to anyone on the

1369
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,640
East Coast so you start to get different

1370
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:47,220
people involved that start to claim

1371
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,838
different things at different times

1372
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:53,098
um most of us obviously weren't there

1373
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:55,139
you know yeah so uh

1374
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:56,519
you know it what are you gonna say about

1375
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:58,078
those type of things

1376
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:59,759
right it's another one of those things

1377
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,160
where people start to create certainty

1378
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,839
on a series of accidents that happened

1379
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,118
when they were young and also partying

1380
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:09,719
yeah you know yeah and now they want to

1381
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:12,240
make it all intentional and uh you know

1382
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:15,000
and so as a result

1383
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:18,000
you know I can see in real Sour I can

1384
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,280
see the 91 and the super skunk yeah I

1385
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,440
personally believe that's the case like

1386
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,900
you know chem dog called my buddy and

1387
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,760
was raving about how much he liked

1388
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,039
growing the hybrids that it accidentally

1389
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,480
got made yeah and that he was filling up

1390
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,739
his rooms with him and that's all he was

1391
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,280
growing

1392
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:38,039
and he told him that in 1994. 1994 is

1393
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,500
the year that you know klopp you know

1394
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:42,539
that weasel and Bondo and these guys are

1395
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,679
getting this weed that they're finding

1396
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:46,019
the seeds in

1397
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,379
you know yeah um

1398
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:52,338
so uh there you go

1399
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:57,480
as far as that goes I actually believe

1400
00:57:52,338 --> 00:58:01,679
that the D is a chem 91 by Super Skunk

1401
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:04,619
hybrid yeah I believe it very strongly

1402
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,659
um that would make D either a sister to

1403
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:08,220
sour or if it depends on which Super

1404
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:11,399
Skunk was used because I know there were

1405
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:13,500
more than one in that group I mean I I

1406
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,358
because you know uh we did this project

1407
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,699
called the Superdog where we tried to

1408
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:21,299
take the density and the potency of the

1409
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:24,239
chem dog and blend it with the the look

1410
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,940
and the frost and the flavor of the

1411
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,919
super skunk and so I you know uh my

1412
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,720
buddies it's from Staten Island and I

1413
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:34,318
worked on it for a number of years so

1414
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:37,139
I've seen a [ __ ] ton of chem Super Skunk

1415
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:40,139
hybrids yeah like a [ __ ] ton I've known

1416
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:43,379
a lot of them and so to me like I can

1417
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:45,779
just see both parents in the chemd yeah

1418
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:49,380
you know can I prove it until we have

1419
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,780
perfect genetic testing no

1420
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,280
it's just we can never have perfect

1421
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,339
genetic testing unless we have the

1422
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,619
baselines which we don't I mean it's you

1423
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:01,318
know it should be possible it's it's not

1424
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:04,140
possible it could be possible like you

1425
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:06,358
know like human DNA they could tell that

1426
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:08,159
um you're not a sister you're a daughter

1427
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:09,598
yeah we could do we could see some

1428
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,298
relations like that but we could never

1429
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,099
go back and say you know like what I'm

1430
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,559
just saying like from from the from the

1431
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:18,720
91 eventually you should be able to tell

1432
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,780
her these sisters or children yeah from

1433
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:25,318
the 91 for sure you know because we at

1434
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:27,000
least have that yeah right and so

1435
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,219
um you know the and the reason why I

1436
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,380
think that is because sometimes the D

1437
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:33,959
smells like super skunk when you crack

1438
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,900
the jar yeah I think that dead rotten

1439
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,858
body nastiness that everybody always

1440
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,500
halitosis that they always talk about

1441
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:44,219
that's kind of a rank skunk kind of

1442
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:47,099
thing yeah uh the D Herms sometimes like

1443
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:49,618
crazy in week three and four which the

1444
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:51,900
super skunk was famous for doing yeah in

1445
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:54,838
the D's case it's sterile pollen and the

1446
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:57,059
super skunks case it was super live yeah

1447
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:59,338
um but I I grew you know I still have

1448
00:59:57,059 --> 01:00:01,680
the the chem the chem dog I've grown it

1449
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:04,380
for I don't know 24 years now or

1450
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:08,098
something I grew the the super skunk for

1451
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:10,740
10. um I think that they you know I

1452
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:13,680
think that the sour the base of sour is

1453
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:15,358
chem super skunk and I think that it's

1454
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,639
very likely that

1455
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:21,179
um that D is pure

1456
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:22,858
uh dog and super skunk and and the one

1457
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:25,679
that can that nobody ever mentions and

1458
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:27,659
I've been fighting to get people to give

1459
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,419
it its uh space in the family tree is

1460
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:32,759
Jesus which I think is the pure Super

1461
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:36,420
Skunk just an asthma yeah I mean the the

1462
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:38,940
you know the the diesel is um

1463
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,099
you know like I said the the super skunk

1464
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,099
through live pollen both early and late

1465
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:45,780
yeah

1466
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:48,720
when you don't make seeds

1467
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:51,900
um after you have a pollination of uh

1468
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:54,480
you know of of [ __ ] it takes a good four

1469
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:57,000
to six weeks for that seed to become

1470
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,298
ripe oh yeah yeah right so

1471
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,460
if you've got some late harm

1472
01:01:00,298 --> 01:01:04,920
unless you let that thing ride and ride

1473
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:08,539
and ride and ride

1474
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,539
you're gonna have immature seats

1475
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:12,719
I don't think diesel looks more like

1476
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,818
anything at all like d and even in the

1477
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,159
s1s there's no D anything in it someone

1478
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:19,318
had mentioned that so I mean I guess

1479
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:21,118
what I'm saying is is that the point I

1480
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:23,099
was trying to make is that for for

1481
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,858
chemdog and these guys to be pulling out

1482
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:29,160
tiger stripe seeds at eight nine ten

1483
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:31,558
weeks uh a lot of times the SS was was

1484
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:34,920
pollinating them through Herms two three

1485
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:37,380
weeks into bloom yeah and that we why by

1486
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,019
week eight nine ten they were ready yeah

1487
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:42,539
right so it's very possible that jesel

1488
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:47,099
is an S1 of the straight Super Skunk

1489
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:48,058
yeah and doesn't have any chem in it

1490
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:49,880
um

1491
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:53,220
oh my gosh

1492
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:56,099
well no there's some good questions come

1493
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:58,078
on so we need to finish with with what

1494
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:01,200
the one through four are all that stuff

1495
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:03,240
first though so so yeah so so to me

1496
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,039
um the uh

1497
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:06,419
that's what I think the D is I can't

1498
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,219
prove it

1499
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,500
um I would bet money though

1500
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:12,959
that money and how it breeds and how it

1501
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:16,798
smells and how it looks I think it's a

1502
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,539
straight dog SS hybrid yeah uh I saw

1503
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:19,798
some people mention the one through the

1504
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:21,838
four

1505
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:22,559
um do you think it has some nl5 Haze in

1506
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:25,259
it

1507
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,140
I think that's very likely uh after

1508
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:32,099
after seeing the one I think I think it

1509
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:34,379
is the quintessential example of a nl5

1510
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:36,780
haze dominant Fino

1511
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,818
in the chem one through four line like

1512
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:43,019
it's more it's very little Kim to me

1513
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:44,699
it's very nl5 hazy yeah and so you know

1514
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:46,559
there's there's an aspect to it where

1515
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:48,239
it's like I just like to say this

1516
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,519
because

1517
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:52,798
once you get on the forums and once you

1518
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:55,139
start writing stuff and once you start

1519
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,599
chatting about things you're sort of

1520
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:59,098
locked into whatever you wrote yeah and

1521
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,298
I think that's been a problem for chem

1522
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:01,859
dog yeah

1523
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:03,298
um because people asked him what he

1524
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:06,318
thought and he gave what he remembered

1525
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:09,239
and then people wanted like deep deep

1526
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:11,880
thoughts yeah on how it all went down

1527
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:14,039
and I don't I think he kind of spouted

1528
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,599
off as best he remembered and then

1529
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:18,659
people wanted a lot of information he

1530
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:21,180
didn't have yeah right it's indisputable

1531
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:23,639
uh they're two of my favorite cuts that

1532
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:25,500
these Cuts came from dude

1533
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:27,480
yeah you know however they were formed

1534
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,338
they exit that's the important part they

1535
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,440
exist they're in the community they've

1536
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:33,659
made amazing hybrids they're pretty

1537
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,400
awesome they're super potent they're

1538
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:37,679
nice

1539
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,318
um you know the the interesting part

1540
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:43,019
about the one and the four the one is

1541
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,699
crazy it takes like 12 or 13 weeks yeah

1542
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:47,338
okay

1543
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:49,558
um the four takes 12-ish weeks usually

1544
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:52,558
we have a buddy pip

1545
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:55,619
um that you know he takes it 84 90 days

1546
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,200
every time yeah okay it grows long

1547
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:59,460
running Spears

1548
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:02,098
um and so it's really interesting

1549
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,760
because the D is a very short squat

1550
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:09,240
Afghan line green Super Skunk looking

1551
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:13,559
thing you know uh the dog is a very

1552
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:16,919
weird looking non-frosty Afghan uh the

1553
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:20,519
four is a super Frosty Long Spears like

1554
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,619
your arm 12 weaker so how do you get a

1555
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:25,500
nine weeker and a 10-weeker and a

1556
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:27,180
13-weeker and a 12-weeker and stuff that

1557
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,460
wants to be two feet tall and stuff that

1558
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:31,440
wants to be six feet tall

1559
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:34,260
um I mean it's possible and the one's

1560
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,500
all mercy and dominant like no Cami

1561
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:40,200
dialect type stuff at all you know it

1562
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:43,139
doesn't you know and so what I what I

1563
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:45,358
think is that um

1564
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:50,519
the D and the dog are different the dog

1565
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:52,679
is the chem 91 and the D is the chemd so

1566
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:56,099
um so basically what we have is we have

1567
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:58,139
these these various plants and to

1568
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:00,660
breeders

1569
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:03,000
um they don't look the same

1570
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:04,980
uh and they don't

1571
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,920
um they don't breathe the same

1572
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:11,338
and their s1s don't come out the same so

1573
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:14,099
you would expect if you did a bunch of

1574
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:18,058
s1s of the chem dog that you would start

1575
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:19,380
to see D finals or four phenos yeah or

1576
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,720
this or that if they're if they're

1577
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,980
sisters and it's all in there yeah you

1578
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:24,358
would expect to see those things you

1579
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:27,838
would see those females you don't see

1580
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:30,420
Jack that looks like any of those no you

1581
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:32,639
really don't and CSI has run out

1582
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:35,338
hundreds of them yeah and other people

1583
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:38,818
have run out probably thousands of csis

1584
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:42,000
s1s too you know and so you know I I

1585
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:44,699
think that you know I think that a lot

1586
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:50,280
of them are from that

1587
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:52,379
you know that dog SS combo yeah you know

1588
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,940
um and so

1589
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,700
you know I mean the good part about it

1590
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,200
is is that the one is not is alive but

1591
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:59,578
it's not really well circulated because

1592
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:03,239
it doesn't look pretty enough and it

1593
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:05,940
takes it takes 13 weeks but the four and

1594
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:08,939
the dog and the D are pretty well passed

1595
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:11,700
out and so lots of people have had them

1596
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:13,679
um there's not really fake so before

1597
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,779
yeah I've never really seen people pass

1598
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,699
things yeah there's you know there's

1599
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,260
been one or two fakes of the of the

1600
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,960
actual dog but it's not particularly

1601
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:25,380
common the D

1602
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,818
there's a lot of fakes yeah tons there's

1603
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:28,559
a lot of fakes

1604
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:31,558
um and so

1605
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,579
there's some chaos behind all that

1606
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,099
um I don't know if we want to get into

1607
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:38,039
all into all that but

1608
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:39,480
um You Know It uh

1609
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:42,119
and what I think

1610
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,159
and this is not knocking Greg or

1611
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,960
anything or chemdog excuse me by

1612
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:49,078
anything like that

1613
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:52,099
um is that uh I think the the fakes of

1614
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:52,099
the D are all sisters

1615
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:58,679
personally I think he had a bag of dog

1616
01:06:55,798 --> 01:07:01,139
Super Skunk hybrids

1617
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:03,480
right yeah and when he lost the D he

1618
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:05,699
went back in that same little bag

1619
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,760
and pop stuff

1620
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:11,879
and I think those and because because

1621
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:14,700
the thing is that's weird is that like

1622
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:17,818
three of the so-called fakes

1623
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:19,980
um came people swear come directly from

1624
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:21,900
chemdog yeah

1625
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,280
then that's probably the case I mean the

1626
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,440
people that I know that got it from him

1627
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,000
there's been a few people I'm pretty

1628
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,380
sure I can trust that got things from

1629
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
him labeled as D that were totally

1630
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,559
different they were they were I mean

1631
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,199
they all swear they got it directly from

1632
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:37,740
dude yeah and it ends up not being the

1633
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:40,798
not being the original d yeah it looks

1634
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:42,479
like the D smells like the D doesn't a

1635
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,038
lot most of them don't grow like the D

1636
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,679
if you know how the D grows and they

1637
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:49,740
just relax structure they typically lack

1638
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:52,679
the the the distinct flavor and the and

1639
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:55,379
the potency yeah but they look extremely

1640
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:58,679
close especially in a bag or in a jar is

1641
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:02,099
dried weed yeah you know

1642
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:05,578
um and so you know there's

1643
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:08,760
there's at least three maybe four fake

1644
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:10,980
D's yeah there's a lot there's a there's

1645
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,680
quite a bit and I think those D's that

1646
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:16,319
got passed out later or bought from

1647
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:18,479
bought from chem dog or whatever

1648
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,759
those things got trade baited all over

1649
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,379
the place yeah they got exploded

1650
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:23,159
everywhere everyone wanted to trade the

1651
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:26,520
Deep

1652
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:28,439
you know and so the real D kind of got

1653
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:32,100
buried

1654
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:34,858
um the least circulated of the D's yeah

1655
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,660
it's the least circulated because and I

1656
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:38,460
mean this is this is this is starting

1657
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:40,079
this is going to get kind of political

1658
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:43,140
or whatever but like

1659
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,939
I mean we can just say it that

1660
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:47,039
um most of there was a time where most

1661
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:49,439
of the people in Colorado

1662
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:52,619
uh that our chemfam didn't have the real

1663
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,838
D no it was the uh Kim CSS one mostly

1664
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:57,358
they went they went through two fake D's

1665
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:59,519
yeah and they didn't even realize that

1666
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,620
they had fake d

1667
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,540
no you'd have to know to know they

1668
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:06,838
didn't they didn't know and so they bred

1669
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:08,519
with it and they traded it and they grew

1670
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,619
it and sold it and all this different

1671
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,460
stuff and it wasn't

1672
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:15,479
um

1673
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:19,259
it wasn't uh it wasn't it yeah you know

1674
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:22,500
I mean in fact I uh I went to an emerald

1675
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:24,779
cup once and I had a fresh jar of real d

1676
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,859
ude okay and there's all these people I

1677
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:27,000
don't need to name them there's all

1678
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,319
these people that are like [ __ ]

1679
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,479
patting me on the back and they're being

1680
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,580
like dude you did the most amazing job

1681
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,798
with this wheat yeah this is

1682
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:36,778
unbelievable the flavor and the potency

1683
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:39,719
you got out of this weed is just what

1684
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:42,120
the [ __ ] did you do yeah right and it

1685
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:43,679
turns out uh even though I was kind of

1686
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:44,698
proud of myself for a minute it turns

1687
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,619
out that

1688
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:48,539
the reason why they were so blown away

1689
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:50,159
by the flavor and the potency was that I

1690
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:52,319
had the right cut

1691
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:53,939
and they did not have the right cut they

1692
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,039
had a difference and people were trading

1693
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:58,979
all these different bags of wheat around

1694
01:09:56,039 --> 01:10:00,600
that weren't the right cut and they were

1695
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:04,198
amazed when they smoked the real one

1696
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:06,360
yeah you know and that and so and this

1697
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,279
and this cut uh and you know it caused

1698
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:10,259
some embarrassment

1699
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:13,198
because some of these people are you

1700
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:15,480
know chem fam or whatever yeah are tied

1701
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,359
in or yeah or whatever the case may be

1702
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:19,619
you know and so you know you're on

1703
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:21,719
you're on Instagram and you're

1704
01:10:19,619 --> 01:10:24,479
pontificating or whatever about like how

1705
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:25,739
you know everything yeah and then all of

1706
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:27,359
a sudden you don't have the real D and

1707
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:29,939
you try and you're using any crosses

1708
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:32,880
yeah and you get the real D and then it

1709
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:37,139
turns out no that's not real either yeah

1710
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:40,199
right and so those fakes just got traded

1711
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:44,039
so much that they drowned out the real D

1712
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:46,559
they also look similar in pictures and

1713
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,779
they look similar as dried weed they're

1714
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,280
much easier to tell when you're growing

1715
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:52,139
them side by side

1716
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:54,719
and they're much easier to tell if you

1717
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:57,840
actually have a jar of real D to smoke

1718
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,179
next to them and there's also the the

1719
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,300
um little bit that the the fake D or the

1720
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:06,239
chem CSS one kicks live pollen whereas

1721
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:08,100
the the KMD doesn't kick life you know I

1722
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:09,359
mean I've had I've had the chemd since

1723
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,579
06.

1724
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:14,880
I mean maybe it produced a seed in that

1725
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:17,219
amount of time but yeah um so I'll

1726
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,520
answer that when my cut is super healthy

1727
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:23,279
uh it almost never variegates

1728
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,860
if you can't get your D to not variegate

1729
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:28,079
it's not the real D yeah there you go

1730
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:30,299
there's like they're they're people some

1731
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:32,819
call some of them dirty D certainly when

1732
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:37,320
it gets hungry I'll I'll make people

1733
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:40,019
laugh and uh it likes calmag yeah it

1734
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:42,539
does it's the the chems are the chems

1735
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,980
are strong eaters and so sometimes if

1736
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:46,079
you're growing organically or whatever

1737
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:48,839
else and you know you have some

1738
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,340
unavailability going on it can you know

1739
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,679
it can variegate

1740
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:54,239
um I have pictures of it variegating uh

1741
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:55,980
there's one on my page but when it's

1742
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,619
when it's Tip-Top shape and totally

1743
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:00,599
healthy you can really look really close

1744
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:02,579
and you can see slight variegation on a

1745
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,699
leaf here and there but other than that

1746
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:07,859
you really can't see it how how prone to

1747
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:09,178
um Fox tailing is your cut

1748
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:11,460
not

1749
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:13,739
yeah see that's the other the main trait

1750
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:16,380
of the the campus ss1 if you're if your

1751
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:18,000
shit's real fluffy and fox tailing it's

1752
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:21,239
most likely not going to be the one that

1753
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,158
people use yeah the original and so

1754
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:24,839
there's a you know there's I mean

1755
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:26,460
there's I don't know it's what's what's

1756
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,319
hard about it is you want to tell the

1757
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:30,600
truth

1758
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:32,819
um uh the the finest chemd i've smoked

1759
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,460
it it's a nice cut it tests super high

1760
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:36,840
it's not the real D at all and and also

1761
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,698
also take into account that it's been

1762
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,400
tissue cultured it has different

1763
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:43,198
hormones in it it's it's it

1764
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,698
the expression is going to totally be

1765
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:47,579
different so it would be hard to tell

1766
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:50,158
I'm not I I you know are you more

1767
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:52,439
skeptical on it I it's not the D okay

1768
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:54,238
that's not it's not doesn't mean it's

1769
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:55,979
bad I haven't seen it so it doesn't mean

1770
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:57,779
it's bad I mean I I've had friends that

1771
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:59,579
have grown it that have bought it from

1772
01:12:57,779 --> 01:13:01,500
finest and run it in licensed Gardens

1773
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:03,479
and stuff like that here in Mendo yeah

1774
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:07,619
it's a nice cut it gets you super baked

1775
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:11,519
it's not the real G yeah you know

1776
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:13,079
um so you know there's and

1777
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,820
man I don't know I mean this is the

1778
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:17,158
point where it's like you want to tell

1779
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:19,439
stories and then you're like okay well

1780
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:21,359
what toes do I step on yeah yeah and

1781
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:23,639
whose toes do I step on and this is why

1782
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:26,099
the the chem story up until this date

1783
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:29,219
has only been told certain ways because

1784
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:31,620
like you tell this story like a hundred

1785
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:33,179
percent as you as you can best tell it

1786
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:35,640
with all the info that we have available

1787
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:37,260
it does step on toes regardless even if

1788
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:39,060
you don't want to it just happens yeah

1789
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:41,100
you know like Joe Brandon people they

1790
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,280
might get mad at me for saying that the

1791
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:46,380
first time they smoked real dog was in

1792
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:47,579
2006 yeah

1793
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,140
you know

1794
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:51,179
but it's for a better story the other

1795
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,500
way but it's true they did you know like

1796
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:53,640
people are asking them about all this

1797
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,738
and that and everything they sold a bag

1798
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,480
they're very important to the story

1799
01:13:55,738 --> 01:13:59,399
yeah you know in the sense that like

1800
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:01,019
they kind of got it going but then they

1801
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:02,099
don't tie in again for another 15 years

1802
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,840
or something

1803
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,940
you know so it's like people gonna get

1804
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:09,060
mad and send me some DMS about whatever

1805
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:10,678
you know because you know and and you

1806
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,940
know there's an aspect to it too where

1807
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,619
it's like

1808
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:15,479
you know then there's people that are

1809
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:17,340
you know approaching chem dog and

1810
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:18,839
approaching others they want to breed

1811
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:22,020
with the Deep they want to breed with

1812
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:24,539
the chem Cuts they want uh you know they

1813
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,940
want uh they don't want to get [ __ ] on

1814
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:29,640
for it they want to be chem fam approved

1815
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:33,178
right yeah and some people are like you

1816
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:34,560
know uh and some you know and so they

1817
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:35,699
Grease the wheels with money and they

1818
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,520
make it happen

1819
01:14:35,698 --> 01:14:40,619
yeah and I'm not blaming dude for that

1820
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,260
or anything like that like I I'm not

1821
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:46,439
trying to you know it's hard to make it

1822
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:49,199
you know somebody Out Here for a Pimp

1823
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:50,698
well you know I mean there's there's you

1824
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,738
know obviously there's certain lines you

1825
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:54,839
shouldn't cross

1826
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,519
but how you monetize things and how you

1827
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,020
do certain things like that like I don't

1828
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,880
really think anything dude has done has

1829
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,679
crossed any lines

1830
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,659
um

1831
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:05,399
so you know yeah the CSI chems are

1832
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:07,198
totally worth hunting through yeah we

1833
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:09,000
said that like 90 times in this thing

1834
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,339
very very very much so the one thing

1835
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,260
that the chem the chem 91 does more than

1836
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:15,900
almost any other strain

1837
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:18,360
it throws potency in all of its

1838
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:20,879
Offspring yeah it does whether it's

1839
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:23,039
outcrosses whether it's the s1s there's

1840
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,980
some s ones that are as potent or even

1841
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:27,600
more potent than the mother cut yeah

1842
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:29,519
you know

1843
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,140
um and so yeah they're absolutely worth

1844
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,420
hunting they're they're worth hunting

1845
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:35,460
from CSI they're worth hunting from

1846
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:37,380
skunk VA

1847
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,300
um you know it if you have the real cut

1848
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:42,060
you can make some really nice really

1849
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:44,159
nice things you know exactly um you know

1850
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:46,320
and then there's preferences too you

1851
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:47,939
know like as as well like I tend to

1852
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,460
think that the 91 is one of my favorite

1853
01:15:47,939 --> 01:15:52,919
cuts of all time I have and I made a

1854
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:55,079
nice one yeah and you know and and I I

1855
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,640
have some good friends like Matt that

1856
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:58,679
aren't into it you know they they give

1857
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,960
it respect for its potency and its power

1858
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:02,219
and it's and its place but it's not

1859
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,560
something they would be choosing to

1860
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:08,640
smoke every day yeah no it [ __ ] me up

1861
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:10,320
in a different way yeah you know and so

1862
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,940
um I mean maybe we'll maybe we'll maybe

1863
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:14,158
we'll say some [ __ ] about the D just

1864
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:16,738
because it it I mean maybe it should be

1865
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:19,519
said right yeah so

1866
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:22,319
you know and I actually I think it's

1867
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,000
killing me I don't I'm not you're

1868
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,880
telling me not to look and I'm trying I

1869
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,420
know I'm sorry that was too good anyway

1870
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,239
um

1871
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:33,600
and I think at times you know uh chem

1872
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:35,399
dog hasn't been super trustworthy uh uh

1873
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,020
not himself but like with some of the

1874
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:38,279
people he was making deals with and

1875
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,900
they're

1876
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:42,179
um you know there's aspects where I

1877
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:45,119
think maybe he gave out things

1878
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:47,640
you know he like you know so

1879
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:50,698
I mean uh you know uh when uh you know

1880
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,719
people don't know this because uh

1881
01:16:50,698 --> 01:16:54,599
um

1882
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:58,439
yeah you know uh as far as I know uh

1883
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:00,300
skunk VA uh has the real D yeah um as

1884
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:02,639
far as I know skunk PA is a really cool

1885
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:04,199
dude and he's been married for a long

1886
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,179
time I don't have anything but good

1887
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:08,579
things to say about him

1888
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:11,219
um Lucky Dog Seed Co I think you'll find

1889
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:13,800
good stuff in his work he uses nice cuts

1890
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:15,960
yeah in most of his stuff you know so

1891
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,600
he's been super transparent with me he's

1892
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:20,399
any question I've ever had he's been one

1893
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,440
of the most forthcoming out of all those

1894
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,359
dudes

1895
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:25,738
I think some of his some some of his

1896
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:28,439
interviews and stuff have been quite

1897
01:17:25,738 --> 01:17:30,178
honest from his perspective yeah um so I

1898
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:31,500
got nothing but good no nothing but good

1899
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:34,679
things to say about

1900
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:37,198
um about that you know I I will say you

1901
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:38,100
know mentioning the Colorado thing that

1902
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:40,019
um

1903
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,579
almost all of those guys out there had

1904
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,380
fake d

1905
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:45,960
right and they were convinced it was

1906
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:47,579
real D because they'd never had real D

1907
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,260
and they got it from Greg they got it

1908
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:50,640
and they'll still argue until they're

1909
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,800
blue in the face that they had the real

1910
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:56,520
D that it never was the fake one

1911
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:59,880
yeah they get pissed yeah yeah

1912
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:01,500
um you know but I mean you know I I

1913
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,420
mean that's the thing too is it's like

1914
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:05,880
and then because it got famous all these

1915
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:07,920
people want to jump in and you know they

1916
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,420
and sometimes like you know you get paid

1917
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,679
or you make some deal with someone and

1918
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,840
then it goes bad and you don't want to

1919
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:15,960
be embarrassed and so there's a lot of

1920
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:20,640
shenanigans that have gone on around it

1921
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:23,100
um you know and uh you know real chemd

1922
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,960
is much better than the finest cut I

1923
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:27,780
mean that's all all life but that's my

1924
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,698
speculation I I would put I would put

1925
01:18:27,779 --> 01:18:31,800
the real D in my probably top five

1926
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:34,079
all-time strains that I like a lot for

1927
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,239
me because it's everything though is is

1928
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,219
so subjective like we could never say

1929
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:39,539
that like everyone's gonna think this

1930
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:41,760
one's better than the other it's just

1931
01:18:39,539 --> 01:18:44,158
kidding it's a can't do that with weed

1932
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,539
no but I mean I will say we talked about

1933
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:49,019
Matt and I talked about it a little bit

1934
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:52,140
on our last live uh you know I I brought

1935
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:53,460
some real d a few times to our uh to our

1936
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,860
some of our Gatherings that we would

1937
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:58,319
have during the emerald cup outside

1938
01:18:55,859 --> 01:19:00,599
and it you know it it put a bunch of

1939
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:03,599
experienced smokers on the ground yeah

1940
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,620
why did people out you know it really I

1941
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,480
mean there were some people that were

1942
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:08,158
staring at the ceiling on the couch for

1943
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:10,198
a number of hours off a couple of bong

1944
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:13,259
hits some people thought about going to

1945
01:19:10,198 --> 01:19:15,479
bed early uh you know it was it was

1946
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:17,820
unusually strong doesn't mean the finest

1947
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:19,139
cut is bad I'm not saying that you know

1948
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,698
a lot of times people have this idea

1949
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:23,340
that if it's not real it can't be good

1950
01:19:20,698 --> 01:19:25,678
yeah and that's a different subject yeah

1951
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,719
you know so it can be it can be not real

1952
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,279
and good

1953
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:31,020
absolutely

1954
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,639
so

1955
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,719
um there's an aspect to it where you

1956
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,760
know I don't know maybe we'll throw some

1957
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:39,420
shade or whatever but

1958
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,159
um you know uh in Colorado

1959
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:42,899
um you know a lot of people don't know

1960
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:45,599
this and they think that that he goes

1961
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:47,460
back [ __ ] forever in chem fam or

1962
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,560
whatever but you know

1963
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:51,600
um you know Duke Diamond paid chem dog a

1964
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:55,500
bunch of money for the right to grow

1965
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:58,920
strengths yeah and he got

1966
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:02,279
um he got the D and the doll and the

1967
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,960
chem dog uh and whatnot from chemdog and

1968
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:05,039
he paid I don't know like 30 grand or

1969
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,260
something like that that's how the story

1970
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:09,179
goes that's how the story he paid a

1971
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,100
cheap paid a chunk of money a chunk of

1972
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:12,719
money for the right to have the cuts and

1973
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,239
the right to breed with the cuts without

1974
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,060
a bunch of [ __ ] yeah you know

1975
01:20:15,238 --> 01:20:20,279
basically paid for vouching yeah pay to

1976
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,960
pay for vouching right yeah and so a lot

1977
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:23,939
of people think that he's he's has some

1978
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,739
deep tires been involved with the chems

1979
01:20:23,939 --> 01:20:27,899
for a long time

1980
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,579
um he never came into contact with them

1981
01:20:27,899 --> 01:20:30,960
I don't think until he came out to

1982
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:33,420
Colorado and worked with your buddy

1983
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,279
Maddie Lee right yeah correct he he

1984
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:37,020
never I don't think he'd ever maybe he'd

1985
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,119
smoked them before but he never had them

1986
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:40,500
he never had access to them and when he

1987
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,420
wanted them he couldn't get them from

1988
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,520
anyone out there that had him so he

1989
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:46,920
bought them the only one I know he had

1990
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,900
early was snow dog that's it no dog yeah

1991
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,560
so

1992
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:51,960
um

1993
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,080
you know so then you know he ends up he

1994
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:56,698
ends up breeding uh those cuts into

1995
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:58,198
everything because it's kind of one of

1996
01:20:56,698 --> 01:21:00,539
the things when he started his own seed

1997
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:03,658
company that was like he was rocking the

1998
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:08,100
headbands and the chems super hard okay

1999
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:10,979
so my buddy uh uh IC Collective he had

2000
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:13,140
lost the D and he had just been out

2001
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:14,819
visiting Colorado and he was like well

2002
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,739
why don't you send it to me

2003
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:19,799
yeah like sure so they send it to him

2004
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:22,379
and he grows it out and he calls him up

2005
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,300
and says you don't have real d

2006
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:28,380
this is the this is what we call the

2007
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:32,699
Bundy sis S1 yeah not real d

2008
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:35,340
not even close yeah okay so for two

2009
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:37,619
years uh three years something like that

2010
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:39,840
uh those guys had spent all this time

2011
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:41,219
breeding the the D into everything they

2012
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,319
had

2013
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:46,380
and then they quietly had to change it

2014
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:49,019
to chem sis yeah they never intended on

2015
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:51,179
on breeding with chemsis and I'll give

2016
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:53,820
him credit for that he did actually he

2017
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:55,500
did change it that's I that's all credit

2018
01:21:53,819 --> 01:21:58,198
because he most people wouldn't even do

2019
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:00,300
that he did he did change it

2020
01:21:58,198 --> 01:22:02,879
um you know and then but it turned out

2021
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,560
that Peabody and Duke diamond and and

2022
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,640
these other dudes out there they all had

2023
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,480
fake d

2024
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:11,699
yeah it was it was Bundy S1 right and

2025
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:13,738
chem says Bundy it was S1 of the real

2026
01:22:11,698 --> 01:22:16,319
chemsis they called the Bundy cut

2027
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:17,579
because Bundy was one of chemdog's

2028
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:19,500
growing partners

2029
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:22,019
uh and one of the people that a lot of

2030
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,760
the growing was actually done by him

2031
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,219
um he's passed away now

2032
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,320
um but it was kind of named for him yeah

2033
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:30,840
he's he's one of the other silent people

2034
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,460
in the whole history of Kim dog that

2035
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,739
doesn't get talked about a lot but I

2036
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:37,198
think he had more to do with the the

2037
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:38,639
genetics aspect and the crossing and any

2038
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,319
intentional Crossing that would have

2039
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,360
been done would probably have been done

2040
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:44,759
by him he had he had a bunch to do about

2041
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:46,439
it but he was like a lot of people you

2042
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,199
know there's uh there's the there's the

2043
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:50,579
forward guy that gets the fame and then

2044
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:52,678
there's some people behind them that are

2045
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:55,380
doing a bunch of the work too that don't

2046
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:57,840
get as famous for whatever reason

2047
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:59,460
um and so one of the good things about

2048
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,020
that is that

2049
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:05,760
that schmuck joint breath uh tricked I

2050
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,260
mean I think I can safely say oh yes

2051
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,140
Mark he's got to be one of the rudest

2052
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:12,960
[ __ ] on IG yeah uh he's a total

2053
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:15,300
[ __ ] bag but he bought he he tricked pea

2054
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:19,140
bud out of the dog and the chemd with

2055
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:20,940
Promises of breeding and Seed sales and

2056
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,320
collaboration and all that and then he

2057
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:24,839
turned around and just started selling

2058
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:26,880
Cuts as fast as he could mother them and

2059
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,739
never gave Peabody damn thing and never

2060
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,960
gave peabot a damn thing and told him to

2061
01:23:28,738 --> 01:23:33,839
[ __ ] off and die basically

2062
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,760
um and he bled some friendships everyone

2063
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:39,600
that he got everyone that got the D from

2064
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,219
that dude was fake yep he was selling

2065
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,239
three to five hundred dollar cuts of

2066
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:47,698
fake D yeah and that's how [ __ ] goes

2067
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:49,439
um and the the interesting part and this

2068
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:51,539
is the reason why I believe that all the

2069
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:53,879
fake D's are sisters to the D

2070
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:55,920
is that at least three of them that were

2071
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:58,440
absolutely positive came from chemdog

2072
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,199
himself yeah and they're all very

2073
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:03,658
similar to the D

2074
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:06,960
right so yeah

2075
01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:09,119
um you know to to chem dog he's never

2076
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,698
been the type to be so militant about

2077
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:14,460
what strain it is when you were buying

2078
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:17,099
chem dog weed it was chem dog weed

2079
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:20,340
because it was from chemdog

2080
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:22,440
he used to call the D chem dog

2081
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:24,179
you know you're buying chemdot weed this

2082
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:26,519
is the chem dog weed I have here's chem

2083
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:28,140
dog wheat yeah you know so for people

2084
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,960
that are like sticklers about things

2085
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,739
that's not your guy you know

2086
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,399
um

2087
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:39,178
and so uh he was both the pre and the

2088
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:40,920
Kentucky skunk guy uh he was a lying

2089
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:44,819
you know he had the big tattoo on his

2090
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:47,760
neck uh he was super rude to people he

2091
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:50,340
was dishonest he lied he stole he

2092
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,560
cheated uh he was very unpleasant human

2093
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:56,000
being yeah he's in Oklahoma I think

2094
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,000
somewhere likely failing

2095
01:24:56,658 --> 01:25:01,619
yeah I mean whatever he was he was one

2096
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:05,640
of the rudest and shittiest people that

2097
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:07,979
I encountered on IG yeah for those that

2098
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,679
don't know you it is very hard to get

2099
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:12,899
not so to see anything about anyone that

2100
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:14,399
isn't a nice like the the only nice

2101
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:17,399
thing you could say about them I have

2102
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:19,139
rarely ever seen him yeah I mean yeah he

2103
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:21,599
just is just I don't know just his

2104
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:22,980
General human being but you know so so

2105
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,960
that's the thing is that there was a

2106
01:25:22,979 --> 01:25:27,959
number of people that got a hold of Kim

2107
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,819
and there's some chem people uh like my

2108
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,399
buddy from Staten Island he's retired

2109
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:35,819
now but who really wanted to keep it

2110
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:37,738
very close yeah and you know and it got

2111
01:25:35,819 --> 01:25:40,019
out and it caused a bunch of Guff that

2112
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:41,158
it got out like a lot of other strains

2113
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:43,860
and

2114
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:46,619
you know so the chemist as far as I know

2115
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:49,439
and I talked to chem dog about this has

2116
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:52,819
been dead for a long time yeah there are

2117
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:55,259
several s1s of it supposedly that exists

2118
01:25:52,819 --> 01:25:58,139
the real D is alive

2119
01:25:55,260 --> 01:26:00,300
and at least three or four fakes

2120
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:02,880
yep you know if you have What's called

2121
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,679
the Dirty D and you like I said before

2122
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,500
if you can't get the variegation to go

2123
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:09,719
away it's fake

2124
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,158
and they look very similar no one is

2125
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:14,279
going to be able to tell you that you

2126
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:17,399
have the the real d by pictures

2127
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:19,259
yeah it's very difficult

2128
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:20,698
um it's you know when you smoke it you

2129
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:23,219
know

2130
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:25,500
you know yeah I've grown some of them

2131
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:28,439
side by side with the real D and you can

2132
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:30,779
see significant growth differences

2133
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:32,879
as long as you have a control group like

2134
01:26:30,779 --> 01:26:34,079
the real one to compare it to

2135
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,800
yeah

2136
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:36,800
you know

2137
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:44,039
um absolutely uh I believe that

2138
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:47,399
um it's 91 SS and it was all accidental

2139
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:49,500
Herms yeah the sour story and the chem

2140
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:52,559
story is All accidental hermaphrodism

2141
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:55,619
there is no intentional anything in it

2142
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,199
yeah it's all accidents

2143
01:26:55,619 --> 01:27:00,300
you know yeah I mean uh I never heard

2144
01:26:58,198 --> 01:27:01,799
Bodhi say a bad word about anyone I

2145
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:03,480
don't really say a bad word about anyone

2146
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,920
I just literally think that like joint

2147
01:27:03,479 --> 01:27:07,619
breath is one of the three worst people

2148
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:09,359
I've met on IG yeah

2149
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:11,639
um he's terrible and if you read his

2150
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:13,139
comments and how he talks to people and

2151
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:14,100
how he breaks his word and various

2152
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:16,319
things I don't even want to talk about

2153
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,820
it well he just openly racist and he

2154
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:19,679
just is he just has all kinds of

2155
01:27:17,819 --> 01:27:21,119
terrible qualities

2156
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,679
um and so I figured I'd mention that

2157
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:25,198
because he literally turned around and

2158
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:28,139
started a clone business selling uh

2159
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,698
chemdog and D Cuts yeah as soon as he

2160
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:32,900
got the moms big enough that was likely

2161
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:32,899
his intention the whole time

2162
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,840
um you know it's not a stupid question

2163
01:27:34,979 --> 01:27:38,638
someone just asked are the sour and D

2164
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:40,199
sisters yeah no I think it's a great

2165
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:43,859
question I think it's a great question I

2166
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:44,579
don't think so but only because

2167
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:46,859
um

2168
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:50,460
we know we know from the story of the

2169
01:27:46,859 --> 01:27:53,099
sour that they got beans out of the

2170
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:55,020
they got beans out of this weed from

2171
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:58,020
from chem dog and it was it was very

2172
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:00,900
likely it was 91 SS yeah so at that

2173
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:02,400
point it's already a hybrid

2174
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:04,619
right

2175
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:07,920
um it wouldn't be it wouldn't be the SS

2176
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:10,260
and the dog making seeds yeah and then

2177
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,000
they grew up those seeds and which

2178
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:15,119
called the diesel one and the diesel two

2179
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,719
and then those things hermed

2180
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:21,238
and out of that Herm comes the sour yeah

2181
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:23,279
so do I think they're straight sisters

2182
01:28:21,238 --> 01:28:26,459
no do I think they're very closely

2183
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:28,619
related yes I do so there's one little

2184
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:31,079
part we hadn't gotten into because it's

2185
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:33,840
kind of part of the story but not and

2186
01:28:31,079 --> 01:28:35,698
it's more of a recent type thing it

2187
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,980
sounds like and this is this is putting

2188
01:28:35,698 --> 01:28:39,960
together stuff from skunkier from his

2189
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:42,238
mentor me

2190
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:45,119
Caleb not to all of us really and

2191
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:47,939
everyone in our our can Illuminati group

2192
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:50,460
um it sounds like at some point what was

2193
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:53,399
given out and taken pictures of and

2194
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:55,500
hybridized as mass Super Skunk might not

2195
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:58,019
be the same original Super Skunk that

2196
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:00,060
came from vam was traded so there is

2197
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:02,639
that little Nuance so we should we

2198
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:04,620
should say this too so there's an aspect

2199
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:06,359
to it where like people don't like to

2200
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:09,539
admit that they've that they've lost

2201
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:11,460
things yeah and so you can go look on

2202
01:29:09,539 --> 01:29:13,560
after this show or whatever you could go

2203
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:16,920
look and see those famous pics that

2204
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:21,000
skunk VA posted of the super skunk yeah

2205
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:24,119
uh from 95 96 all that type of stuff and

2206
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,319
it looks very sour like very long Spears

2207
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:29,939
tall lanky stretchy those type of buds

2208
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:32,399
uh the super skunk that got passed

2209
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:34,919
around Massachusetts and the stuff that

2210
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:37,439
was in the High Times is a much wider

2211
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:40,560
much thicker much shorter Afghani type

2212
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:42,178
yeah and so I think I can't say for

2213
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,340
certain like I said it's conjecture but

2214
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:46,800
I think that you know

2215
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:48,659
the super skunk itself and its children

2216
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,320
and its hybrids produced a variety of

2217
01:29:48,658 --> 01:29:53,879
seeds and chem dog probably had a bag of

2218
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:55,198
this seed and a bag of that seed and a

2219
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,179
bag of some of this

2220
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:59,879
and people have tried to recreate it

2221
01:29:57,179 --> 01:30:02,100
yeah there was also some busts involved

2222
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:04,619
you know there was some other issues

2223
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:09,060
there was various things

2224
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:11,279
um you know and uh you know it um

2225
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:14,520
you know I felt I tell are you from that

2226
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:16,559
from that um crew with Camillo in them

2227
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:18,000
sorry one second

2228
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,199
because that that is one question I've

2229
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,359
always had whether the one that's in

2230
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:23,099
diesel is the one that's in sour there

2231
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:25,920
was a couple there was supposedly a six

2232
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:28,139
and an eight yeah you know

2233
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,179
um we got I guess what we you would

2234
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:32,880
classify as the six I suppose although

2235
01:30:30,179 --> 01:30:33,500
we didn't find that out until much later

2236
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,239
um

2237
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:38,279
but uh but that was the one that got

2238
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:39,839
that got passed it out I'm not going to

2239
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:41,340
answer which sour is better and which

2240
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,760
one is the real deal we could do an

2241
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:47,119
entire sour episode talking about it

2242
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:49,860
um oh okay yeah

2243
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:51,840
well that guy is super I mean yeah the

2244
01:30:49,859 --> 01:30:54,238
hard part about in there the hard part

2245
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,739
about the sour crew is that you know is

2246
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:59,759
that people have different memories of

2247
01:30:55,738 --> 01:31:01,379
things you know and weasel and vondo and

2248
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,579
man some of these guys they don't all

2249
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:04,800
agree on everything

2250
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:07,559
weasel can't tell the same story I love

2251
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:09,119
the dude he's super cool super nice I

2252
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,739
love his listening to him talk about

2253
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:12,179
history and stuff but he's had a very

2254
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:14,039
hard time being consistent in his

2255
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:16,020
stories from one day to the next

2256
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:17,880
literally like there was a podcast maybe

2257
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:20,159
a week in between the two where he told

2258
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:23,159
completely different stories about the

2259
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:24,658
history of sour so when when I going

2260
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:26,819
through history and stuff when I see

2261
01:31:24,658 --> 01:31:28,799
that I usually toss it all out because

2262
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:31,019
if it's an unreliable narrator as far as

2263
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:34,199
being able to remember the story well

2264
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:36,060
you know consistently I toss it I will

2265
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:39,000
say this

2266
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:41,940
um about this the sour thing is that

2267
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:45,060
because the sour came out of a bunch of

2268
01:31:41,939 --> 01:31:48,539
hermaphroditic weed yeah okay I believe

2269
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:51,360
there was a couple cuts even early on

2270
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:52,738
right and then Bondo who was one of the

2271
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,420
guys that actually lived in the

2272
01:31:52,738 --> 01:31:57,779
apartment where the accident happened

2273
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:59,520
right yeah when he moved West he took

2274
01:31:57,779 --> 01:32:01,920
some seeds with him from that initial

2275
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,239
thing West and sprouted and sprouted

2276
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,219
some and kept a cut in Southern

2277
01:32:03,238 --> 01:32:08,339
California yeah

2278
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:10,319
um according to him so I think you know

2279
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:12,239
I don't think that there was just one I

2280
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:15,059
think there was two or three

2281
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:17,638
um and then uh

2282
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:19,679
You Know It uh

2283
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:21,480
it became the most popular weed in

2284
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,579
America for 10 years

2285
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:25,859
and then [ __ ] res named a strainer

2286
01:32:23,579 --> 01:32:29,939
and named his named his personal strain

2287
01:32:25,859 --> 01:32:32,759
after it sadly so who had the real one

2288
01:32:29,939 --> 01:32:34,859
who had the right one everybody thinks

2289
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:38,460
the real Sour Diesel is the whatever one

2290
01:32:34,859 --> 01:32:41,099
they saw first yeah generally speaking

2291
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,719
you know no it's true yeah I can say I

2292
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:45,239
can say this about the sour I got the

2293
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,819
sour in 2000.

2294
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:50,099
and I've never lost it

2295
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:52,259
I don't know which one it is yeah but

2296
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,060
I've had it for 22 years now

2297
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:56,760
so

2298
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:58,679
um you know is it the first is it one of

2299
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,199
the couple you know

2300
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:02,579
um luckily for us most of the diesel

2301
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:03,599
cuts are nice

2302
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:05,219
yeah

2303
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,199
you know when people talk about real

2304
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:09,359
when people talk oh I can take trace it

2305
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:10,619
back to 95 I can this I can that and you

2306
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:12,299
should buy it for five thousand dollars

2307
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:14,340
a pound because it's

2308
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:15,719
you know that's a lot of marketing yeah

2309
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:18,480
to me

2310
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:20,639
but the sour story is confusing

2311
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:22,859
you know and again it's more confusing

2312
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:24,900
every day when people when newer people

2313
01:33:22,859 --> 01:33:27,658
enter the scene and claim old Heritage

2314
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:29,460
on their sour cut and you know a lot of

2315
01:33:27,658 --> 01:33:30,839
people are still the past five six years

2316
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:33,060
and they don't know these people are new

2317
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,500
it just conflates it more and over the

2318
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:36,719
years ago it's gotten even [ __ ]

2319
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,399
crazier yeah and and so there's a thing

2320
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:41,039
too where it's like there's a lot of

2321
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:43,079
people that had sour back in the day

2322
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,539
and they got rid of sour

2323
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:47,880
yeah and then they got it back

2324
01:33:45,539 --> 01:33:49,979
and it wasn't the same one

2325
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:52,800
so it's very difficult the vast majority

2326
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:54,119
of people I mean I I see uh you know I

2327
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,100
see people chatting about this or

2328
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:57,658
whatever I mean you know if people

2329
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,880
remember I'm not even calling dude out

2330
01:33:57,658 --> 01:34:01,559
but if people remember you know J plant

2331
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,840
speaker went through a two or three year

2332
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:06,300
period where he thought that like seeds

2333
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,760
you know only growing from seed was the

2334
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:10,139
way and the Clones were bunk you know it

2335
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,280
was very you had probably had he's

2336
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:13,440
deleted them all now but he's had

2337
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:16,738
hundreds posts about it he was super

2338
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:19,198
into seeds the market changed on him and

2339
01:34:16,738 --> 01:34:21,479
you know in 2017 or something he got

2340
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:24,238
that sour back

2341
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:26,879
you know and so he he's had the sound

2342
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:28,799
he's had the sour about four years yeah

2343
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,840
does that mean that he didn't he had it

2344
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,360
in the past at some point you know sure

2345
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:35,880
but most people had to get it back

2346
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:37,439
because they moved on to other [ __ ] yeah

2347
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,239
and that's how a lot of things get lost

2348
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:40,979
is people are like oh I don't need that

2349
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:42,000
right now homies got it I'll just get it

2350
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:43,559
back whenever

2351
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,800
and then they keep getting back the

2352
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:49,860
thing that they don't remember yeah

2353
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:51,659
you know so I mean

2354
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:53,939
I have this thing and it's expensive and

2355
01:34:51,658 --> 01:34:55,619
it kind of sucks at times but I like to

2356
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:57,178
keep weed that I like

2357
01:34:55,619 --> 01:34:59,340
yeah

2358
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:01,560
you know and so some of these things

2359
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:03,779
I've just kept for a long time like if I

2360
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:06,239
lost my sour I would never

2361
01:35:03,779 --> 01:35:09,238
be able I I all the ones I've gathered

2362
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:12,658
aren't the one that I have yeah

2363
01:35:09,238 --> 01:35:14,158
you know um if I lost the real D

2364
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:16,138
um I mean I know a couple people thank

2365
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:17,638
God but like if I was trying to find it

2366
01:35:16,139 --> 01:35:19,319
like one of you guys out there in the

2367
01:35:17,639 --> 01:35:21,659
community it would be really [ __ ]

2368
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:23,759
hard yeah because there's more fakes

2369
01:35:21,658 --> 01:35:27,420
than not

2370
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:30,300
um you know and so you know AJ doesn't

2371
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:32,819
even the this the cut that AJ grows and

2372
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:36,779
and moves Now isn't the cut that people

2373
01:35:32,819 --> 01:35:39,420
got as AJ's 20 years ago yeah no I I can

2374
01:35:36,779 --> 01:35:42,059
speak to that personally at the um first

2375
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:44,158
Adam Dunn cup when he brought out his AJ

2376
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:45,179
sour we were all standing around just

2377
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:46,319
expecting because it was one of the

2378
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:49,260
first times he'd come out in quite a

2379
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:51,359
while and he was there with uh JJ and he

2380
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:52,619
brought out this jar and said this is my

2381
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:54,839
sour so we're all kind of hanging around

2382
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:57,179
it let's see what his [ __ ] what AJ's

2383
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:58,800

01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:05,100
away

2386
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:07,560
it was it was not it was not sour as we

2387
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:09,900
know it it was very very different yeah

2388
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:11,940
I mean it's been a really bad cure it

2389
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:13,679
may have been any number of things but

2390

2419
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,800
aspects and they kept asking me which

2420
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:26,340
sour is it

2421
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:29,340
is it the choco is it the res cut is it

2422
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:32,100
the AJ is it the the East Coast Sour

2423
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:34,139
Diesel is it the shroomy cut it Amish is

2424
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:36,239
it yeah there's so many yeah and I was

2425
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:37,199
like I don't [ __ ] know I have no idea

2426
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:38,099
I have no idea what you're talking about

2427
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:41,178
what are you what are you talking about

2428
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:44,159
because I never got any of those because

2429
01:37:41,179 --> 01:37:45,960
I got this hour long ago and never lost

2430
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:47,399
it so I thought I had this hour so why

2431
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,679
the [ __ ] would I trade someone else for

2432
01:37:47,399 --> 01:37:51,238
it yeah exactly right so I start

2433
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,800
collecting these things and I get the

2434
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:54,959
New York City Diesel and I get the East

2435
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,820
Coast Sour Diesel and I get the the

2436
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,139
Amish and this and this and this and

2437
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:01,380
this and I'm like okay I'm gonna figure

2438
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:04,319
out which one mine is yeah and I grow

2439
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:06,020
them all out and none of them are mine

2440
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:08,759
so I was like oh

2441
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:11,460
you know it seems like the East Coast

2442
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,500
sour diesel or what some people call the

2443
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,539
East Coast Sour Diesel and the choco are

2444
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:17,219
the same yeah I was the one who named it

2445
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:19,260
choco cut and it was only because when

2446
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:21,600
people had asked me like hey what which

2447
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:23,400
cut is yours choco had the best

2448
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,320
representation and grow and so they

2449
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:27,299
called for that matter and it was the

2450
01:38:25,319 --> 01:38:31,019
best representation to grow that's the

2451
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:33,000
same cut that is the um that that uh uh

2452
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:34,500
the devil's Harvest crew Scott reach and

2453
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,319
all those guys it's the same cut that

2454
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:39,719
they run as sour and it's the same most

2455
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:42,000
likely the same cut that CSI uses itself

2456
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:44,579
as well Amish and shroomy are the same

2457
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,939
cut right I have no clue those are two

2458
01:38:44,579 --> 01:38:49,859
I've never wrote so I mean I you know I

2459
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:51,658
I tend to like you know this might sound

2460
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:53,939
self-serving or whatever I like the one

2461
01:38:51,658 --> 01:38:56,879
that I have the best yeah and I like the

2462
01:38:53,939 --> 01:38:58,379
one I had best you know I I like that

2463
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,600
one the best I do think that the one

2464
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:04,859
that my our buddy pip gave me that was

2465
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:06,360
ecsd yeah it was the mother of the Death

2466
01:39:04,859 --> 01:39:08,579
Star yeah

2467
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:10,619
um that one I didn't like as much but

2468
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:12,960
yeah I uh

2469
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:15,420
um I like that one a whole bunch yeah

2470
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,719
that's the people say S1 you're sour the

2471
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:22,260
reason why sour is notorious

2472
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:25,439
for not throwing pollen yeah you know

2473
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:27,000
it's horrible you can cross things to it

2474
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:29,759
right

2475
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,979
um and uh Amish is the Pennsylvania one

2476
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,179
yeah and it got called Amish because of

2477
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:35,879
that

2478
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:38,520
um so there's you know we've had friends

2479
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:41,699
that have reversed the sour and gotten

2480
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:43,440
like 15 seats yeah if that if we've had

2481
01:39:41,698 --> 01:39:46,198
friends reverse the sour multiple times

2482
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:48,359
and completely [ __ ] fail and people

2483
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:50,879
that are pretty proficient at reversing

2484
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:53,460
not just me but others yeah and yeah

2485
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,960
it's just not and CSI various other

2486
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:57,480
friends

2487
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,219
um a pip you know reverse some and

2488
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:01,738
literally got like a personal amount

2489
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:03,300
yeah and reversing stuff and having it

2490
01:40:01,738 --> 01:40:06,599
fail is expensive

2491
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:09,539
so you know it's very difficult to so

2492
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:12,960
there's and and you know and sour is a

2493
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:15,359
wide ver is you know it's like everyone

2494
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:17,520
how do I put this the right way everyone

2495
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:19,559
claims to like diversity

2496
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,860
but they still want to find the fire in

2497
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:24,780
every pack yeah so you start selling

2498
01:40:22,859 --> 01:40:27,000
some Sour hybrids and start throwing a

2499
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:29,340
bunch of a bunch of junk

2500
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,260
amongst the gold and people are pissed

2501
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,659
yes because they don't want to buy a

2502
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:34,679
hundred seeds to find a couple that are

2503
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:37,019
fire

2504
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:40,440
yeah you know so sour has been a

2505
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:43,080
difficult breeder and it doesn't S1 it

2506
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:46,079
doesn't seem any of the cuts S1 well

2507
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:49,380
yeah which is why you rarely ever see

2508
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:51,179
sour s1s for sale yeah if you do you

2509
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:53,639
should probably know [ __ ] side eye in

2510
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:55,679
that [ __ ] and most often the the sour

2511
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:57,960
cuts that are sold are high that are

2512
01:40:55,679 --> 01:41:01,260
that are reversed or something was

2513
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:04,079
reversed onto them yeah it takes pollen

2514
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:06,420
fine yeah and no mix you know I make

2515
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:09,420
seeds it makes hella seed with that blue

2516
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:12,658
bonnet process I did it makes it yeah

2517
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:16,859
but you know making seed of itself not

2518
01:41:12,658 --> 01:41:19,920
so not not so simple not so not so

2519
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:22,500
simple as far as that though

2520
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,060
um I you know honestly dude uh there's

2521
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:28,920
there's another question

2522
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:31,739

2549
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:38,460
there's a there's a bunch of people

2550
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:40,380
um and I I don't wanna I don't want to

2551
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:42,600
judge people right but there's a bunch

2552
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:46,260
of people that monetize their access to

2553
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:48,719
Cuts yeah and sell cuts to whoever to

2554
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:49,800
make money I've never sold cuts to make

2555
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:53,039
money

2556
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:55,320
uh I give cuts to my personal friends

2557
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:56,880
so people would be like oh you're a

2558
01:42:55,319 --> 01:42:58,198
[ __ ] you don't give your headband out

2559
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:01,139
and I'll be like what do you mean like

2560
01:42:58,198 --> 01:43:03,658
half my crew lived off the headband for

2561
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:05,159
years yeah you know like if you're my

2562
01:43:03,658 --> 01:43:07,738
personal friend and we're good buddies

2563
01:43:05,158 --> 01:43:08,579
and or you know whatever like I tend to

2564
01:43:07,738 --> 01:43:10,379
share

2565
01:43:08,579 --> 01:43:12,118
if we're not like and you're like hey

2566
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:14,460
can I just buy this thing off you I've

2567
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:16,559
just I've just never monetized Cuts I've

2568
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:19,500
given and I'm not even judging I'm just

2569
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:21,239
saying that like I typically give I

2570
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:23,819
typically trade with people that I think

2571
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:26,519
are like have have a good heart and you

2572
01:43:23,819 --> 01:43:28,319
read the same way that I do

2573
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:31,320
you know

2574
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:33,658
um and so you know that's it's I don't

2575
01:43:31,319 --> 01:43:35,039
really sell Cuts I'm not I'm not hyping

2576
01:43:33,658 --> 01:43:37,859
that's the other part of it right is

2577
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:41,819
that I don't I don't like I'm not hyping

2578
01:43:37,859 --> 01:43:43,319
it for you to buy anything from me yeah

2579
01:43:41,819 --> 01:43:45,779
you know

2580
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:48,539
um original D is a tough one to find

2581
01:43:45,779 --> 01:43:51,118
info on because uh I did a live feed

2582
01:43:48,539 --> 01:43:52,500
just trying to show how to to find info

2583
01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:56,279
on something and use that as an example

2584
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:57,779
I can't trace the the uh day record I

2585
01:43:56,279 --> 01:43:59,219
can't trace it I can't trace it back

2586
01:43:57,779 --> 01:44:00,359
past a certain point and it's it's

2587
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:02,639
frustrating because it's one of my

2588
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:05,219
favorite Gods so I'll say this too the

2589
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:07,679
sour has a super confusing story

2590
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:11,100
because the people involved don't all

2591
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:11,779
agree exactly what happened yeah

2592
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,500
um

2593
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:15,539
and

2594
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:18,600
um well Duke also someone's saying what

2595
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:20,399
headband is Duke using uh Duke is in a

2596
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,139
federal halfway house getting out of the

2597
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:23,698
clink he's not using anything he doesn't

2598
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:26,460
have any plants he's not breeding

2599
01:44:23,698 --> 01:44:30,719
anything the cut he had before is what

2600
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:32,698
we call the the 56th day it's an OG type

2601
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,198
um he never had the LA he never had the

2602
01:44:32,698 --> 01:44:36,359
day record he never had anything like

2603
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:37,500
that yeah um he doesn't have anything

2604
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:39,059
right now

2605
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:40,500
um but he uh

2606
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,219
so

2607
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:43,679
um

2608
01:44:41,219 --> 01:44:45,719
so there's an aspect where before I lose

2609
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:47,579
my train of thought the sour story is

2610
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:49,800
tough because everybody back in the day

2611
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:52,738
got their sour cut helpfully labeled

2612
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:55,079
sourdie yeah all these other names came

2613
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:58,319
about when the forums happened

2614
01:44:55,079 --> 01:45:01,380
so much later than that right yeah and

2615
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:04,319
resdog [ __ ] made a made a line of

2616
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:06,239
seed called sour d and sour was super

2617
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:07,738
popular but we know quite a bit about

2618
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:09,238
the story we just can't figure

2619
01:45:07,738 --> 01:45:12,539
everything out because people don't

2620
01:45:09,238 --> 01:45:15,979
agree yeah the headband story

2621
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:18,960
is basically a total [ __ ] mystery

2622
01:45:15,979 --> 01:45:21,599
people there

2623
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:24,359
and people pop up here and there and say

2624
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:26,219
oh I know but who did it who named it

2625
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:29,339
how they do it

2626
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:33,060
I can I can say this I got my headband

2627
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:37,260
cut in in very early 2000s and I've

2628
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:39,420
never lost it okay it's a diesel type

2629
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:42,960
okay

2630
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:46,380
the what people call the 56 day

2631
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:48,840
is a renamed OG Kush yes there was

2632
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:51,359
violence in the Kush family down in

2633
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:53,039
Southern California a guy fled to the

2634
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:55,559
Bay with that cut

2635
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,479
he wanted to grow and sell that cut he

2636
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:59,219
didn't want the stress of whatever was

2637
01:45:57,479 --> 01:46:01,799
happening in Southern California to

2638
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:03,719
follow him they decided they were going

2639
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:06,000
to rename the cut

2640
01:46:03,719 --> 01:46:10,859
they decided on the name headband

2641
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,819
yep and a dude in the bay uh a dude in

2642
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:13,019
the bay

2643
01:46:11,819 --> 01:46:18,420
um

2644
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:22,440
uh what gave out a mislabeled tray

2645
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:26,300
of that headband yeah and that's how

2646
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:29,579
um Bob hemp Hill IC Collective myself

2647
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:32,279
right around 0.506 or something like

2648
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:35,880
that we all got it yeah Lumpa headband

2649
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:37,618
is also likely a renamed OG yeah and

2650
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,900
he'll get super pissed at me for saying

2651
01:46:37,618 --> 01:46:42,179
this but it didn't pop up until about 08

2652
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:44,099
or 09. yeah you can get pissed off he

2653
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:46,500
wants but that's I mean it's just that's

2654
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:48,480
even from him back when we were close he

2655
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:51,000
would say it's just a [ __ ] OG you

2656
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:52,319
know it's it's a it's likely an OG S1

2657
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,439
yeah

2658
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:57,238
um you know it uh it popped up by the

2659
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:59,219
time that he was talking on the forums

2660
01:46:57,238 --> 01:47:02,759
about having it I'd had my my headband

2661
01:46:59,219 --> 01:47:04,020
for eight years yeah something like that

2662
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,179
um I've been trying to look for

2663
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:09,840
information on exactly what my headband

2664
01:47:06,179 --> 01:47:12,300
is for 20 some years yeah not easy

2665
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:14,460
yeah it's not easy there's just certain

2666
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:16,440
things that the headband is a very

2667
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:19,079
mysterious story

2668
01:47:16,439 --> 01:47:21,839
um the 707 Headband is the child it was

2669
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:23,760
made by mandelbrot it's the child of uh

2670
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,739
my headband cut

2671
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,840
um and my headband cut was actually

2672
01:47:25,738 --> 01:47:29,879
passed out quite a bit in Humboldt Mendo

2673
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,159
but it's really finicky and a pain in

2674
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:34,020
the ass and people got rid of it because

2675
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:36,238
sour was easier to grow

2676
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:38,639
yeah

2677
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:42,299
so that's that's the deal with the 707

2678
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:45,239
the 707 mandelbrot took the LA the the

2679
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:47,039
LA cut which we call it the headband cut

2680
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:50,039
and crossed into an Afghan and sold it

2681
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:52,859
as the 707 he made it in Humboldt that's

2682
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:55,380
the area code up here in Humboldt Mendo

2683
01:47:52,859 --> 01:47:58,079
so that's why he called it the 707. and

2684
01:47:55,380 --> 01:48:01,500
so after post swerve releasing his Sour

2685
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:02,698
OG almost every single cut that was

2686
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:05,060
found from that was called something

2687
01:48:02,698 --> 01:48:08,158
headband so at that point

2688
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:10,560
I've actually wondered if my headband

2689
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:13,738
cut is

2690
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:16,619
um from the sour seeds that vondo popped

2691
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:18,359
in LA could be yeah he told me he popped

2692
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:20,279
seeds and he got a really nice pheno of

2693
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:22,439
it I don't know that's complete

2694
01:48:20,279 --> 01:48:25,319
conjecture

2695
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:29,158
um but you know I it's very closely

2696
01:48:25,319 --> 01:48:30,539
related yeah but actual information it's

2697
01:48:29,158 --> 01:48:33,059
kind of like when we talked on the live

2698
01:48:30,539 --> 01:48:36,060
actual information about Urkel the who

2699
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:38,280
the what the where and the how no yeah

2700
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:40,020
people don't know nothing definitive

2701
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:41,880
nothing definitive people have a [ __ ]

2702
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:43,800
ton of names that they apply to way too

2703
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:46,859
many Cuts day Wrecker

2704
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:51,119
you know uh original oh boy original

2705
01:48:46,859 --> 01:48:52,979
right yeah Loompa this that whatever

2706
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:55,618
um underdog

2707
01:48:52,979 --> 01:48:58,259
the underdog OG I don't know Underdog

2708
01:48:55,618 --> 01:49:00,479
Goji is just lupus headband renamed it's

2709
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:03,900
all the same [ __ ] all of it's the same

2710
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:05,939
[ __ ] uh candy cut the firebomb Indica

2711
01:49:03,899 --> 01:49:09,539
Hawaiian headband it's had so many

2712
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:12,059
things actually I'll say this Lumpa uh

2713
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:15,060
you know Lumpa was very open with his

2714
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:17,400
friends that he renamed the Lumpa

2715
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:19,400
headband whatever he wanted to to Market

2716
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:22,759
it at the time yeah

2717
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:25,198
he said he gave it Fusion causes sales

2718
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:27,480
yeah he he gave it four or five

2719
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:29,960
different names yeah it's a great it's

2720
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:32,638
it's very it's a shitty breeder

2721
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:34,319
uh none of my friends it's very

2722
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:37,440
inconsistent yeah let's put it that way

2723
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:39,539
it's very inconsistent and um but it's a

2724
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:42,779
nice cut yeah definitely gets you high

2725
01:49:39,539 --> 01:49:44,100
definitely works that was I expected a

2726
01:49:42,779 --> 01:49:45,960
lot more diversity with the Bonnet but

2727
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:47,400
it made some fire [ __ ] with the Bonnet

2728
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:50,158
but I've had other lupus headband

2729
01:49:47,399 --> 01:49:52,138
crosses that would just [ __ ] bombs and

2730
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:54,000
it's just it's inconsistent so all the

2731
01:49:52,139 --> 01:49:56,279
stuff with all the stuff with sour and

2732
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,219
headband and the diesel family there's

2733
01:49:56,279 --> 01:50:00,658
some fact and there's some conjecture

2734
01:49:58,219 --> 01:50:01,800
and I doubt

2735
01:50:00,658 --> 01:50:04,319
um

2736
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:06,539
you know I I doubt that it'll ever be

2737
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,819
completely cleared up yeah uh even the

2738
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:10,979
guys involved don't all agree and as

2739
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:12,238
Matt mentioned before uh weasel or

2740
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:14,279
whatever

2741
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:17,399
um you know he's talked and written

2742
01:50:14,279 --> 01:50:19,039
multiple different stories yeah there

2743
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:21,179
was a guy that was wanted to ask about

2744
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:23,340
Origins TK

2745
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:25,260
or whatever uh that's another one where

2746
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:27,360
the same gentleman has written three

2747
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:29,159
completely different stories different

2748
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:31,559
strains different years slightly

2749
01:50:29,158 --> 01:50:32,579
different versions and so even if you

2750
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:34,980
want to believe that one of those

2751
01:50:32,579 --> 01:50:37,260
versions is true they can all be true

2752
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:39,299
yeah they can all be true and in his

2753
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:41,760
he's just seems to be more

2754
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:43,619
more sure about what it was than he was

2755
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,020
in the past I think that's the best way

2756
01:50:43,618 --> 01:50:49,079
I'd put it in in the in the beginning he

2757
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:51,239
said in 1994 he got hired by the guys

2758
01:50:49,079 --> 01:50:53,698
that he was he was being paid for to

2759
01:50:51,238 --> 01:50:55,618
grow to go to Amsterdam and mule some

2760
01:50:53,698 --> 01:50:58,138
seeds back and they bought half a dozen

2761
01:50:55,618 --> 01:51:00,899
different seed packs and they grew it

2762
01:50:58,139 --> 01:51:02,639
all in this 12 lighter and it hurt and

2763
01:51:00,899 --> 01:51:06,658
one of them they missed a male or it

2764
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:08,460
hermed on this triangle that they called

2765
01:51:06,658 --> 01:51:09,899
the triangle because it was from the

2766
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:12,420
triangle area

2767
01:51:09,899 --> 01:51:14,339
and then he told us he was on our

2768
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:16,980
Discord a few years ago and he told us

2769
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:18,659
that he went there in 91. yeah you know

2770
01:51:16,979 --> 01:51:20,819
his current story was he went there in

2771
01:51:18,658 --> 01:51:23,099
89. yeah

2772
01:51:20,819 --> 01:51:25,198
um you know so he's he's written three

2773
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:27,119
completely different stories with

2774
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,279
different times different plants

2775
01:51:27,118 --> 01:51:31,738
different strains listed

2776
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:33,599
so I mean what do you do with that yeah

2777
01:51:31,738 --> 01:51:37,500
what are you doing the same dude has

2778
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:41,340
three versions of events you know

2779
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:43,979
um you know I uh my favorite OG

2780
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:45,900
I think a lot of the ogs are good

2781
01:51:43,979 --> 01:51:48,718
I don't think they're a lot different

2782
01:51:45,899 --> 01:51:50,759
than each other I never understood LA's

2783
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:53,939
fascination with 40 different cuts of OG

2784
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:57,539
and having [ __ ] dispensaries filled

2785
01:51:53,939 --> 01:52:00,059
with 27 different types of the same

2786
01:51:57,539 --> 01:52:03,300
[ __ ] thing yeah I tend to think the

2787
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:04,500
oldest ones are good uh the TK I like a

2788
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:07,980
lot

2789
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:09,899
um certainly like the TKS ones from CSI

2790
01:52:07,979 --> 01:52:11,759
are amazing

2791
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:14,579
um I like the Flowrider which I got

2792
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:17,100
early so

2793
01:52:14,579 --> 01:52:19,500
you know I um

2794
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:21,840
you know there's uh there's a lot of

2795
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:23,880
stuff that goes on with that that

2796
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:26,940
Famous Cuts that's what happens with

2797
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:29,159
Famous Cuts people rename them people

2798
01:52:26,939 --> 01:52:32,158
get bad bad seeds and put their own name

2799
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:33,539
on them right uh people call them

2800
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:35,759
different names to sell them to

2801
01:52:33,539 --> 01:52:38,579
different groups of people yeah who you

2802
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:41,460
get it from it bases what name you call

2803
01:52:38,579 --> 01:52:43,500
it because that's who they called it

2804
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:44,600
um the ghost OG

2805
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:47,939
um

2806
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:50,520
today isn't the Ghost OG that was traded

2807
01:52:47,939 --> 01:52:52,559
long ago yeah not the same cut at all

2808
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,020
the ghost that goes around us ghost

2809
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:56,639
isn't even the same ghost the ghost that

2810
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:58,199
goes around is Ghost Now isn't the

2811
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:00,000
original ghost that was getting passed

2812
01:52:58,198 --> 01:53:01,799
out and that original ghost was getting

2813
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,600
sold to people for thirty to fifty

2814
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:05,400
thousand dollars a cut I'm talking about

2815
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:07,560
the guy that goes around his ghost isn't

2816
01:53:05,399 --> 01:53:09,359
even the same yeah the guy the guy who

2817
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:11,219
go throw isn't even the re isn't even

2818
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:12,839
the original ghost that actually traded

2819
01:53:11,219 --> 01:53:14,880
it in the very beginning yeah that's not

2820
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:17,039
the person that cut was named after chem

2821
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:19,319
91 is is

2822
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:23,100
I mean you could call it very Bland I

2823
01:53:19,319 --> 01:53:25,738
suppose I will say I said it before that

2824
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:26,940
not always does the flavor pop on chem

2825
01:53:25,738 --> 01:53:29,158
91.

2826
01:53:26,939 --> 01:53:31,678
the potency and the effect for me is

2827
01:53:29,158 --> 01:53:33,359
almost always there the flavor that I

2828
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:34,319
like comes out about once every three

2829
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:36,719
rips

2830
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:38,639
so I and I've talked about my favorite

2831
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:41,158
chem 91 version

2832
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:43,139
um was a chem 91 hybrid from Elite

2833
01:53:41,158 --> 01:53:44,819
cannabis and the reason I liked it so

2834
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:48,659
much was because it was true to the chem

2835
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:50,939
91 looks smell was more more terpy and

2836
01:53:48,658 --> 01:53:51,899
the flavor was so [ __ ] insane so if

2837
01:53:50,939 --> 01:53:53,759
any of you guys can get a hold of

2838
01:53:51,899 --> 01:53:56,460
Resurrection it's a great chem 91 seed

2839
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,800
line you know chem 91 is like chem 91 is

2840
01:53:56,460 --> 01:54:01,439
actually quite a bit like sour uh sour

2841
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,719
can be pretty [ __ ] hard to nail yeah

2842
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:08,359
yeah you get it to reach its genetic

2843
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:08,359
potential it is absolutely bomb yeah

2844
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:16,019
yeah I mean there was uh I I believe I

2845
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:18,779
I'll answer I'll answer dude because

2846
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:21,719
he's tied into homie but yeah um I see

2847
01:54:18,779 --> 01:54:25,019
Collective I believe he got the dog the

2848
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:28,679
91 in 1997 right after he graduated high

2849
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:32,159
school he moved in with skunk VA yeah

2850
01:54:28,679 --> 01:54:34,380
and they lived together uh he skunk VA

2851
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:38,460
was growing and that was the first place

2852
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:40,859
that I see Collective lived outside of

2853
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:43,380
um outside of his parents house you know

2854
01:54:40,859 --> 01:54:45,599
and so yeah he got it he got it right

2855
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:48,539
around 1997 and that was multiple years

2856
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:50,520
before any of us saw OG yeah I mean even

2857
01:54:48,539 --> 01:54:53,158
if you listen to like um

2858
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:54,840
uh Bubba kush's story and those guys I

2859
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:56,638
don't think they even moved West until

2860
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:59,400
1996.

2861
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:01,679
okay I got a question for you not so How

2862
01:54:59,399 --> 01:55:03,479
likely do you think it is that Northern

2863
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:06,139
Lights is responsible in any way for

2864
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:06,138
Camden anyone

2865
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:11,039
I think that it's a reasonably good

2866
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:13,259
chance

2867
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:16,139
interesting there you go

2868
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:17,940
um I can't post it here but

2869
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:24,539
um I was talking before about our buddy

2870
01:55:17,939 --> 01:55:27,539
pip yeah and pip had a uh 88-day chem 4.

2871
01:55:24,539 --> 01:55:30,060
yeah okay that he had

2872
01:55:27,539 --> 01:55:34,500
um put on that he had just gotten done

2873
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:36,420
and I had him open an 89 catalog of the

2874
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:39,600
seed bank Neville's Neville seed bank

2875
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:41,100
and put it right next to a bud of nl5

2876
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:43,679
haze

2877
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:45,600
and it was like it was really close okay

2878
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:47,460
so you're referring to chem for being

2879
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,600
you probably have it but how about chem

2880
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:51,000
91

2881
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:55,560
I think it's a reasonable chance I mean

2882
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:58,139
uh CSI isn't it I I mean which Which nut

2883
01:55:55,560 --> 01:56:03,360
NL I mean look

2884
01:55:58,139 --> 01:56:05,400
um in 19 in in 1990 1991 NL was one of

2885
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:08,219
the most common things you could buy

2886
01:56:05,399 --> 01:56:11,339
yeah there was nl1 there was nl2 there

2887
01:56:08,219 --> 01:56:12,658
was nl5 there was multiple hybrids of

2888
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:14,219
each

2889
01:56:12,658 --> 01:56:16,679
so

2890
01:56:14,219 --> 01:56:19,618
um do I think that uh do I think that it

2891
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:24,179
could be in there yes I do

2892
01:56:19,618 --> 01:56:27,359
um I think it I think NL and skunk and

2893
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:30,239
Hayes are likely in most things yeah at

2894
01:56:27,359 --> 01:56:33,059
least one of the three and sometimes I

2895
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:35,939
tend to disagree on on nl5 being in

2896
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:38,760
camera 91 only because it's so it's so

2897
01:56:35,939 --> 01:56:42,000
uniform and stable you didn't say nl5 I

2898
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:43,500
think NL is in it appear okay but I I

2899
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,020
still think it's more likely going to be

2900
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:48,000
an Afghan T descendant it could be it

2901
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,440
could be entirely possible you know if

2902
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,420
we move it out of the NL range

2903
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:53,519
personally yeah but but that but that's

2904
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:56,100
what I'm saying is that you know we're

2905
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:58,679
we're going on 31 years now since the

2906
01:56:56,100 --> 01:57:01,199
seed has popped yeah um it's all this

2907
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:03,060
part is all Theory you could sit there

2908
01:57:01,198 --> 01:57:05,339
we don't know that it came from dog Bud

2909
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:08,699
we don't know if it came from the dog

2910
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:10,679
Bud that was sold on the lot to chemdog

2911
01:57:08,698 --> 01:57:14,039
we don't know if it came from weed later

2912
01:57:10,679 --> 01:57:17,340
we don't know [ __ ] yeah we know some

2913
01:57:14,039 --> 01:57:20,819
weed sold on dead tour led to the chem

2914
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:22,739
91. yes that's what we know yeah and it

2915
01:57:20,819 --> 01:57:25,738
was given it was the weed was sold to a

2916
01:57:22,738 --> 01:57:28,319
17 year old yeah buy some early

2917
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:31,198
20-something weed hustlers

2918
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:32,399
in a parking lot yeah out of out of the

2919
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:34,678
car

2920
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:39,000
at a dead show

2921
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:41,760
so not exactly you know yeah the closest

2922
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,560
thing that I've ever seen to 91 in just

2923
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,739
growing General Afghani different types

2924
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:49,920
there was an old Bazaar uh land race

2925
01:57:46,738 --> 01:57:51,500
that Soma was selling and I think DNA

2926
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:54,779
sold it as

2927
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:56,399
Afghan some kind of Afghan uh for a

2928
01:57:54,779 --> 01:57:58,500
while they were relabeling it but it was

2929
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:00,359
an old Mazar and it was very harm thrown

2930
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:03,539
and it grew very much like chem 91

2931
01:58:00,359 --> 01:58:06,118
endless white pistols uh had a little

2932
01:58:03,539 --> 01:58:07,800
bit of the leaf cannibalization stuff

2933
01:58:06,118 --> 01:58:10,319
um just the general structure resin

2934
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:12,239
production and then The Afghani one has

2935
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:13,799
a lot of similar traits which for a long

2936
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:16,198
time I thought it's got to be an Afghani

2937
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:17,579
one for sure so tell the Afghan T stuff

2938
01:58:16,198 --> 01:58:19,500
kind of came up I'll I'll throw

2939
01:58:17,579 --> 01:58:21,899
something that throw through me for a

2940
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:24,599
loop um at one of our little Canon

2941
01:58:21,899 --> 01:58:27,779
Illuminati Cana Illuminati parties that

2942
01:58:24,599 --> 01:58:29,219
we threw during the emerald cup CSI came

2943
01:58:27,779 --> 01:58:31,559
down and was hanging out with us that

2944
01:58:29,219 --> 01:58:34,560
weekend and him and I had a long chat

2945
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:38,219
about whether or not chem 91 could be an

2946
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,719
S1 from nl5 Haze yeah and it kind of

2947
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:42,300
blew my mind because I'd never really

2948
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:45,960
considered it but it does have rare

2949
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:49,380
potency it is tall it does take a long

2950
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:51,300
time for an Afghan yeah we do start

2951
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:52,800
these lives late uh we're Cali I can't

2952
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,480
and help it

2953
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:57,420
um I'm sorry it's late

2954
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:59,759
and uh but that's the way it goes

2955
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:03,779
uh Elite cannabis from Colorado is legit

2956
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:06,119
yes very much so and so so you know kale

2957
01:59:03,779 --> 01:59:10,079
uh Caleb wondered you know could it have

2958
01:59:06,118 --> 01:59:12,420
been an S1 from nl5 Haze and it just

2959
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:14,340
leaned toward the NL side

2960
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:16,079
and that and you know and he thinks it's

2961
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:18,960
an S1 of something

2962
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:21,719
not a full hybrid just because of the

2963
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:24,118
narrow range of Finos it throws yeah

2964
01:59:21,719 --> 01:59:26,579
like it kind of throws itself

2965
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:29,339
yep and so from a breeding perspective

2966
01:59:26,579 --> 01:59:30,960
that's a really good hint that

2967
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:33,079
um it's

2968
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:37,500
um self

2969
01:59:33,079 --> 01:59:40,559
yeah yep that's a really good hit but I

2970
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:43,079
do not believe ever

2971
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:44,340
um I think the only path to any kind of

2972
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:47,819
certainty

2973
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:50,819
is eventually DNA testing that is as

2974
01:59:47,819 --> 01:59:53,099
accurate as human DNA testing yeah and I

2975
01:59:50,819 --> 01:59:55,799
have no idea when that is going to pop

2976
01:59:53,099 --> 01:59:58,500
up sure wasn't philos we are not going

2977
01:59:55,800 --> 02:00:03,360
to get any amazing new information from

2978
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:06,359
Joe brand or P bud or chemdog or anyone

2979
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:08,639
that clarifies it yeah

2980
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:11,098
we're just not

2981
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,599
you know so

2982
02:00:11,099 --> 02:00:15,119
um and that's not a diss on them it's

2983
02:00:12,599 --> 02:00:17,579
just you know a bag of weed was sold

2984
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:19,079
that you know I mean you know everyone

2985
02:00:17,579 --> 02:00:20,639
wishes that like some of the most

2986
02:00:19,079 --> 02:00:22,019
important things you ever do you'd

2987
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:24,779
realize it was one of the most important

2988
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:27,179
things you'd ever do yeah but sometimes

2989
02:00:24,779 --> 02:00:29,219
it's just Friday night yeah sometimes

2990
02:00:27,179 --> 02:00:30,840
that ain't how it is

2991
02:00:29,219 --> 02:00:32,460
you know

2992
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,659
um well we still have people in here I'm

2993
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:36,840
gonna say I'm gonna throw up some

2994
02:00:33,658 --> 02:00:39,658
options at the very end on my website uh

2995
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:41,699
luckily the website's back up running we

2996
02:00:39,658 --> 02:00:43,259
got credit card acceptance the sprays up

2997
02:00:41,698 --> 02:00:45,178
there to get you can we have cash for

2998
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:46,560
money order ready to rock

2999
02:00:45,179 --> 02:00:48,060
um I'll throw some options up there for

3000
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:50,400
something I'm not sure what but it'll

3001
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:52,980
probably be breeders packs of stuff uh I

3002
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:55,198
might do the the Blue Sour breeders

3003
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:57,118
packs because it's a very it's very true

3004
02:00:55,198 --> 02:00:59,399
breeding to the sour side as opposed to

3005
02:00:57,118 --> 02:01:03,719
Berry doesn't come through so much and I

3006
02:00:59,399 --> 02:01:05,279
might do maybe a pack of the um sour dub

3007
02:01:03,719 --> 02:01:07,500
cross to diesel something like that

3008
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:09,479
where it's very super strong

3009
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:12,060
um super stock dominance so I wanted to

3010
02:01:09,479 --> 02:01:13,859
plug that in there right tico.com and uh

3011
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:16,139
go check out Speak Easy seed bank they

3012
02:01:13,859 --> 02:01:18,179
also have some other stuff up there

3013
02:01:16,139 --> 02:01:20,520
um yeah so now they got that done if you

3014
02:01:18,179 --> 02:01:21,658
want options go there after this back to

3015
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,800
the story

3016
02:01:21,658 --> 02:01:25,019
um people are talking about can you just

3017
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:26,940
get a grow license and and do it all

3018
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:28,800
legally the problem with getting a grow

3019
02:01:26,939 --> 02:01:31,379
license and doing it all legally is that

3020
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:33,239
then it creating right now and incurs so

3021
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:35,099
much expenses to go legal in just about

3022
02:01:33,238 --> 02:01:36,839
any state that it makes it really

3023
02:01:35,099 --> 02:01:38,520
difficult for people to just wildly

3024
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:41,279
experiment with no Financial benefit

3025
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:43,800
yeah it would be amazing if that was the

3026
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:45,960
case and legality I was hoping for a

3027
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:48,659
while would really open things up but

3028
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:51,118
it's kind of limited things in a way

3029
02:01:48,658 --> 02:01:53,399
um you know because it's got It's So

3030
02:01:51,118 --> 02:01:55,639
financially expensive you really have to

3031
02:01:53,399 --> 02:01:55,638
win

3032
02:01:56,840 --> 02:02:03,539
it's going to be less and less coming up

3033
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:05,399
because with more with more uh laws

3034
02:02:03,539 --> 02:02:07,439
going down about space how many plants

3035
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:09,719
you can grow all that there's going to

3036
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:11,339
be a lot less playing time you know I

3037
02:02:09,719 --> 02:02:13,260
mean people say just said Oklahoma even

3038
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:15,060
in Oklahoma most of the people that are

3039
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:17,280
out in Oklahoma that that are doing it

3040
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:19,619
cheap they're blowing it up right now to

3041
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:21,779
make a bunch of money most people out in

3042
02:02:19,618 --> 02:02:24,059
Oklahoma went there and lost that's

3043
02:02:21,779 --> 02:02:26,519
that's why I mean that's the thing that

3044
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:28,500
people want to know like is that all the

3045
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:31,320
all the breeding that I did for a long

3046
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:34,979
time was financially very stupid

3047
02:02:31,319 --> 02:02:37,319
yeah because I could have taken this I

3048
02:02:34,979 --> 02:02:39,238
could have taken that same space and

3049
02:02:37,319 --> 02:02:43,139
pumped out weed that sold for way more

3050
02:02:39,238 --> 02:02:45,779
yeah you know uh way more you know and

3051
02:02:43,139 --> 02:02:48,420
so that's why that's honestly why I like

3052
02:02:45,779 --> 02:02:50,819
so much stuff comes from like a

3053
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:52,679
relatively small group of people yeah

3054
02:02:50,819 --> 02:02:54,359
because most people if they're given the

3055
02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:56,219
opportunity to grow weed

3056
02:02:54,359 --> 02:02:57,299
they just try to grow as much wheat as

3057
02:02:56,219 --> 02:02:59,219
they can of something that makes them

3058
02:02:57,300 --> 02:03:01,320
the most money yeah

3059
02:02:59,219 --> 02:03:03,539
and especially 20 years ago when I was

3060
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:05,759
doing a lot of my breeding

3061
02:03:03,539 --> 02:03:07,260
um before before you could monetize like

3062
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,940
with IG and all these different things

3063
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:12,179
and you could be a little personal

3064
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:15,000
American breeder yeah like breeding was

3065
02:03:12,179 --> 02:03:16,859
like a labor of love

3066
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,158
you know my buddy from Staten Island

3067
02:03:16,859 --> 02:03:22,319
talked about you know how how many seeds

3068
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:24,658
you could make in a in an eight lighter

3069
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:26,039
versus how many pounds yeah and he was

3070
02:03:24,658 --> 02:03:28,618
like man if we could just sell these

3071
02:03:26,039 --> 02:03:30,658
even for a dollar or two we could wait

3072
02:03:28,618 --> 02:03:33,059
way more money than that eight Miner

3073
02:03:30,658 --> 02:03:34,859
could make yeah but we didn't have the

3074
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:36,539
infrastructure or the internet or the

3075
02:03:34,859 --> 02:03:38,639
this or that or whatever in order to

3076
02:03:36,539 --> 02:03:40,319
like actually like you know and then

3077
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:41,760
even when we did get the internet I was

3078
02:03:40,319 --> 02:03:43,319
on the forums

3079
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:45,840
they're in the Cannabis world and

3080
02:03:43,319 --> 02:03:48,238
overgrow era and then they busted

3081
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:50,279
Heaven's get Heaven Stairway

3082
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:51,899
and they shut all that [ __ ] down and a

3083
02:03:50,279 --> 02:03:55,139
bunch of people got in trouble

3084
02:03:51,899 --> 02:03:59,158
and I kind of hid on the forums until IG

3085
02:03:55,139 --> 02:04:01,380
yeah because I wasn't a computer expert

3086
02:03:59,158 --> 02:04:04,259
and I I wasn't good I wasn't going to be

3087
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:06,179
like masking my IP address and masking

3088
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:08,159
this and hiding like I wasn't computer

3089
02:04:06,179 --> 02:04:09,960
savvy enough you're not you're still not

3090
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:11,759
computer savvy no but I just mean in the

3091
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:13,500
sense of like trying to get away with

3092
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,420
like selling a bunch of illegal [ __ ] to

3093
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:18,238
people I met on the internet

3094
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:20,158
it didn't seem it didn't seem uh it

3095
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:21,839
didn't seem wise even when I got into it

3096
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:24,779
I was one of the first people to sell

3097
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,400
worldwide from the US and everybody

3098
02:04:24,779 --> 02:04:28,198
thought I was a [ __ ] idiot for doing

3099
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:29,638
it and I probably was you know like it

3100
02:04:28,198 --> 02:04:30,960
was more risk than I should have taken

3101
02:04:29,639 --> 02:04:32,880
at the time but

3102
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,980
um yeah that even the idea of that just

3103
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,900
wasn't happening even when I came into

3104
02:04:34,979 --> 02:04:38,939
it which is much later than you

3105
02:04:36,899 --> 02:04:42,539
and it's hard I mean I'll say this too

3106
02:04:38,939 --> 02:04:44,638
like I you know I don't want to say like

3107
02:04:42,539 --> 02:04:46,380
you know some people might interpret

3108
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:48,539
when you talk about truth or you talk

3109
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:49,920
about your opinion uh there's a there's

3110
02:04:48,539 --> 02:04:52,380
a real common thing right now where

3111
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:54,420
people talk about oh you're a hater or

3112
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:56,400
oh you're dissing me or something like

3113
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:58,920
yeah I'm not really trying to do that to

3114
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:00,960
most people when it comes down to it but

3115
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:02,520
you know people have their version of

3116
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,698
events and people have their version of

3117
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:08,099
Truth and most of the time people only

3118
02:05:05,698 --> 02:05:11,039
tell you the truth in cannabis if it

3119
02:05:08,099 --> 02:05:12,960
financially benefits them yeah there's a

3120
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:15,479
lot of things that are sort of like

3121
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:19,739
commonly known amongst the tight circles

3122
02:05:15,479 --> 02:05:21,000
that don't get put out to the common I

3123
02:05:19,738 --> 02:05:23,039
don't want to say Commons the wrong word

3124
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,779
but to the masses because they don't

3125
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:27,118
want the blowback

3126
02:05:24,779 --> 02:05:29,340
yeah you know they don't want they don't

3127
02:05:27,118 --> 02:05:31,380
want the attacks they don't want the you

3128
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:32,880
know you're calling me a liar oh you're

3129
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:36,539
saying that like something I said once

3130
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:39,000
was inconsistent I thought we were Bros

3131
02:05:36,539 --> 02:05:40,618
you're supposed to back me up yeah and

3132
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,899
that's how a lot of stuff stays secret

3133
02:05:40,618 --> 02:05:44,519
and that's why it took this long for a

3134
02:05:42,899 --> 02:05:47,039
lot of this to even come out would I

3135
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:50,340
collab with Bodhi sure

3136
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:53,219
um uh Bodhi is again he's a he's a

3137
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:55,079
[ __ ] Lobo Bodie is a good friend of

3138
02:05:53,219 --> 02:05:58,020
both of ours

3139
02:05:55,079 --> 02:05:58,679
um you know I uh yeah you know

3140
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:02,099
um

3141
02:05:58,679 --> 02:06:05,399
most of the time honestly I uh you know

3142
02:06:02,099 --> 02:06:07,500
I I I I use flour to survive and seeds

3143
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:09,359
were the passion yeah for some people

3144
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:11,099
it's reversed and seeds are the way to

3145
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:14,158
survive and flower is the passion you

3146
02:06:11,099 --> 02:06:17,219
know I I grew I grew flower to survive

3147
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:19,259
so seeds were I mean I gave I haven't

3148
02:06:17,219 --> 02:06:20,698
really sold seeds but I gave thousands

3149
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:22,860
and thousands of them away

3150
02:06:20,698 --> 02:06:25,019
yeah and entire seed companies were

3151
02:06:22,859 --> 02:06:27,719
created off of it

3152
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:31,679
um because back then the goal to be

3153
02:06:27,719 --> 02:06:33,840
frank wasn't uh wasn't rapper money it

3154
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:35,639
was trying to make better weed

3155
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,840
we didn't think there was any money in

3156
02:06:35,639 --> 02:06:39,380
seeds

3157
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:39,380
yeah

3158
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:43,500
you know do we think the dankety Dank is

3159
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:46,619
going to disappear it could

3160
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:48,118
yeah it's under real risk because the

3161
02:06:46,618 --> 02:06:51,359
powers that bee don't really care about

3162
02:06:48,118 --> 02:06:52,979
as you put it dankity dank yeah um a lot

3163
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:54,179
of money that spends dollars with

3164
02:06:52,979 --> 02:06:56,579
companies

3165
02:06:54,179 --> 02:06:58,920
you're you're using your dollars like

3166
02:06:56,579 --> 02:07:01,139
votes granted it's not a political

3167
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:03,118
process but it kind of is and if you

3168
02:07:01,139 --> 02:07:05,819
keep supporting companies that keep

3169
02:07:03,118 --> 02:07:08,098
doing these like non-stop gelato hybrids

3170
02:07:05,819 --> 02:07:10,738
cookies oh my God let me enter let me

3171
02:07:08,099 --> 02:07:13,679
interject sure since he does get a bad

3172
02:07:10,738 --> 02:07:16,618
rap these days and it's well deserved

3173
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:19,618
yeah because Sensei outsourced all of

3174
02:07:16,618 --> 02:07:22,380
their work to Spain yeah they are they

3175
02:07:19,618 --> 02:07:25,319
are not the Legends they were in the 90s

3176
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:27,179
correct they I don't know what what else

3177
02:07:25,319 --> 02:07:29,639
they have I don't know how much they

3178
02:07:27,179 --> 02:07:32,819
have that's real I know they got busted

3179
02:07:29,639 --> 02:07:36,300
in 1999 2000 and they move their

3180
02:07:32,819 --> 02:07:38,698
operation out of Holland into Spain and

3181
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:40,679
they get third parties to make their

3182
02:07:38,698 --> 02:07:42,419
seats

3183
02:07:40,679 --> 02:07:44,279
um could they have one or two strains

3184
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:46,500
among there that they sent to those

3185
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:48,599
people and they have and it's semi what

3186
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:52,439
it was I suppose

3187
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:54,360
but they sell everything that they used

3188
02:07:52,439 --> 02:07:56,759
to sell they even use the same [ __ ]

3189
02:07:54,359 --> 02:07:58,799
pictures that Neville had in his Seed

3190
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:00,380
Catalog from the 80s

3191
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:04,739

02:08:39,118 --> 02:08:45,899
financially expensive to them

even like when we went off on sour and

3216
02:09:00,118 --> 02:09:04,319
headband and stuff I consider that chem

3217
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:06,719
family yeah it's still all very relevant

3218
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:08,399
um you know and so

3219
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:13,079
um but yeah I mean basically what it

3220
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:14,939
boils down to is that uh chemdog

3221
02:09:13,079 --> 02:09:17,479
um through a series of accidents and

3222
02:09:14,939 --> 02:09:19,979
sheer luck uh

3223
02:09:17,479 --> 02:09:21,738
got some really really incredible

3224
02:09:19,979 --> 02:09:24,718
strains came out of his little circle

3225
02:09:21,738 --> 02:09:27,238
yeah and I think honestly he's more of a

3226
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:28,439
glass blower than he is a breeder nerd I

3227
02:09:27,238 --> 02:09:30,718
don't say that I don't mean that in a

3228
02:09:28,439 --> 02:09:32,819
bad way people like no no people have

3229
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:35,279
different interests he's a very talented

3230
02:09:32,819 --> 02:09:37,319
glassblower for sure yeah him him being

3231
02:09:35,279 --> 02:09:39,960
able to share some of this stuff with my

3232
02:09:37,319 --> 02:09:41,519
buddy from Staten Island and share it

3233
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:43,380
with other people and have some Herm

3234
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:46,920
accidents happen kind of change the face

3235
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:49,139
of cannabis it did and so he deserves a

3236
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:51,359
lot of credit for that because he as a

3237
02:09:49,139 --> 02:09:54,300
teenager was growing weed in a totally

3238
02:09:51,359 --> 02:09:57,000
illegal State and an undergoing risk

3239
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:58,619
yeah and so if I've said some things

3240
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,118
that counter counter dicks his Like

3241
02:09:58,618 --> 02:10:01,559
official word or whatever I'm not

3242
02:10:00,118 --> 02:10:03,719
dissing him

3243
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:06,960
you know on any level

3244
02:10:03,719 --> 02:10:08,698
um he contributed a lot yeah you know

3245
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:11,099
um people want you know imagine if

3246
02:10:08,698 --> 02:10:14,158
someone asked you to remember 10 or 15

3247
02:10:11,099 --> 02:10:15,779
or 20 years ago exactly what happened

3248
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:17,039
and imagine you had three friends in the

3249
02:10:15,779 --> 02:10:18,599
room and they put you all in separate

3250
02:10:17,039 --> 02:10:21,179
rooms and they ask you to remember the

3251
02:10:18,599 --> 02:10:23,099
exact story yeah there's going to be

3252
02:10:21,179 --> 02:10:26,639
differences yeah

3253
02:10:23,099 --> 02:10:28,440
for sure and people's memories change

3254
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:29,880
you know yeah and there's a lot of

3255
02:10:28,439 --> 02:10:31,319
people who tried to change the story for

3256
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:32,819
their own good later on they weren't

3257
02:10:31,319 --> 02:10:36,238
even a part of the original curve so

3258
02:10:32,819 --> 02:10:37,559
yeah I think we covered it all yeah I

3259
02:10:36,238 --> 02:10:39,959
mean so now you have a lot of things

3260
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:42,020
where you know chem family gets thrown

3261
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:44,579
around and this gets thrown around and

3262
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:47,460
you know it's like the people that are

3263
02:10:44,579 --> 02:10:49,319
that are most involved

3264
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:52,560
um you know like my buddy from Staten

3265
02:10:49,319 --> 02:10:54,899
Island or even IC Collective or

3266
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:56,820
um you know uh I you know for a long

3267
02:10:54,899 --> 02:10:58,500
time skunk VA but I guess he did a

3268
02:10:56,819 --> 02:11:01,139
podcast or two and kind of enlightened

3269
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:03,539
things the the vocal ones were the ones

3270
02:11:01,139 --> 02:11:05,699
that were the least involved yeah

3271
02:11:03,539 --> 02:11:07,920
and The Quiet Ones happen to be the ones

3272
02:11:05,698 --> 02:11:09,779
that had the most to do with it

3273
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:11,940
um I didn't I wasn't involved for [ __ ]

3274
02:11:09,779 --> 02:11:15,420
except where I got them super early and

3275
02:11:11,939 --> 02:11:18,899
I kept helped keep them alive yeah

3276
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:21,840
you know so

3277
02:11:18,899 --> 02:11:23,759
um you know it uh and everyone's version

3278
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,199
everyone's version of events you can

3279
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:27,780
weave into the rest of the people's

3280
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:30,178
events yeah and in some cases you have a

3281
02:11:27,779 --> 02:11:32,340
situation where you just have to pick

3282
02:11:30,179 --> 02:11:34,260
who you believe

3283
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:39,360
that's sometimes what it boils down to

3284
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:41,400
you know I mean uh you know I mean we we

3285
02:11:39,359 --> 02:11:43,079
have we have debates all the time and

3286
02:11:41,399 --> 02:11:44,759
and they'll be like I can't believe you

3287
02:11:43,079 --> 02:11:45,960
you believe that [ __ ] and I'm like

3288
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:47,239
well the [ __ ] that you believe I

3289
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:49,679
don't believe either

3290
02:11:47,238 --> 02:11:51,598
you know and as you can tell like me and

3291
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:54,480
not so don't even necessarily agree on

3292
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:55,800
what the what it could be what it's you

3293
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:57,779
know the beginnings there's still stuff

3294
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:59,760
that we don't necessarily agree on and

3295
02:11:57,779 --> 02:12:01,198
that we will debate like head to head

3296
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:03,960
all the time because we're [ __ ] nerds

3297
02:12:01,198 --> 02:12:05,158
like that but yeah same with CSI same

3298
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:06,480
same with any number of different

3299
02:12:05,158 --> 02:12:09,059
friends people have their different

3300
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:11,819
ideas and you know like I said there's

3301
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:12,780
there's fact and there's conjecture you

3302
02:12:11,819 --> 02:12:14,399
know

3303
02:12:12,779 --> 02:12:17,340
um and I try to be clear when you

3304
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:19,319
venture from one to the other

3305
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:20,639
um you know so

3306
02:12:19,319 --> 02:12:23,158
um but I do think that getting the

3307
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:25,020
information out there matters because as

3308
02:12:23,158 --> 02:12:28,319
things legalize and things go there's a

3309
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:31,199
lot of cool stories in cannabis that'll

3310
02:12:28,319 --> 02:12:32,939
just be lost yeah

3311
02:12:31,198 --> 02:12:35,039
so we're going to try to keep

3312
02:12:32,939 --> 02:12:36,719
documenting them as best we can

3313
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:40,079
um hopefully this was enlightening for

3314
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:42,779
all of you uh or or some people you know

3315
02:12:40,079 --> 02:12:45,059
I hope you uh I hope you enjoyed it and

3316
02:12:42,779 --> 02:12:47,039
and of course we we talk all the time in

3317
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:49,800
the breeder Syndicate Discord

3318
02:12:47,039 --> 02:12:51,300
um you can find that going to Google and

3319
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:53,039
you can type in breeders Syndicate

3320
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:54,420
patreon you could join through there

3321
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:56,460
it's five dollars a month and we all

3322
02:12:54,420 --> 02:13:00,840
hang out shoot the [ __ ] in there watch

3323
02:12:56,460 --> 02:13:03,179
fights and talk a lot about weed history

3324
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:05,300
um the current political goings-on in

3325
02:13:03,179 --> 02:13:08,639
weed be that different breeders

3326
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:10,760
different strains what have you uh

3327
02:13:08,639 --> 02:13:12,900
nachos in there too yeah

3328
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:14,460
he's a hard person to access on

3329
02:13:12,899 --> 02:13:17,158
Instagram because I mean he's probably

3330
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:18,599
got a million [ __ ] cue of waiting

3331
02:13:17,158 --> 02:13:21,299
people to approve and he doesn't really

3332
02:13:18,599 --> 02:13:23,520
memorize Who's Who and people like to

3333
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:25,500
report accounts so it's it's a you know

3334
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,900
it's it's an easy way to catch him is in

3335
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:30,238
the Discord that isn't it it's it's more

3336
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:33,238
communicative uh IG used to be better

3337
02:13:30,238 --> 02:13:35,519
when it was when it was time based

3338
02:13:33,238 --> 02:13:37,559
and before Shadow Banning and all that

3339
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:39,960
type of stuff it's not it's not what it

3340
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:42,599
used to be that's right in terms of a

3341
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:44,460
communication tool at least yeah

3342
02:13:42,599 --> 02:13:46,199
um and so you know and you know you got

3343
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:47,399
kids and lives and things and this and

3344
02:13:46,198 --> 02:13:48,899
that but

3345
02:13:47,399 --> 02:13:52,439
um I do think it's important to come out

3346
02:13:48,899 --> 02:13:54,779
and like say and have community

3347
02:13:52,439 --> 02:13:58,500
um and a lot of a lot of a lot of

3348
02:13:54,779 --> 02:14:01,019
unfortunately a lot of podcasts and a

3349
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:03,000
lot of things are sort of like like an

3350
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:05,280
infomercial about the person or their

3351
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,719
own personal company yeah there's not a

3352
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:08,639
lot going on where people just want to

3353
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:11,099
talk about history or people just want

3354
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:12,840
to talk about various aspects that don't

3355
02:14:11,099 --> 02:14:15,480
benefit them or don't burnish their

3356
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:17,699
Legend you know and so I think we need

3357
02:14:15,479 --> 02:14:18,959
some more of that just in general yeah

3358
02:14:17,698 --> 02:14:20,869
and to finish this off don't forget

3359
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:24,039
about Reddit seedco.com

3360
02:14:20,869 --> 02:14:24,039
[Music]

3361
02:14:25,578 --> 02:14:29,698
it is true because if you don't support

3362
02:14:28,198 --> 02:14:33,059
the real ones then it makes it much

3363
02:14:29,698 --> 02:14:35,339
harder for real ones to exist

3364
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:37,380
all right well thanks for coming on not

3365
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:38,940
so it's always a pleasure maybe we can

3366
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:40,380
do Friday night is a good night to do

3367
02:14:38,939 --> 02:14:42,118

3368
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:44,340
try to make this a regular thing so

3369
