1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,319
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,839
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,059
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,859
cannabis strain history old smuggling

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,019
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,519
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,439
subculture

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,160
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,259
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,719
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,460
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,140
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,340
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,159
just weren't there

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,300
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,299
to the underground

18
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,479
we joined this conversation already in

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,120
progress and it kind of ends abruptly

20
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,058
too so uh yeah

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,698
let's get to it

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,259
tend to be on like meth head hours which

23
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:59,939
sucks because like you don't want to

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,738
have that in common with them but at the

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,119
same time it's like realistically light

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,518
hours are cheaper if you're an indoor

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,259
grower at night so like a lot of us live

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,240
on vampire hours and that's just how it

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,640
goes and if you're keeping moms yeah

30
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,919
neighbors traveling after 10 p.m yeah

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,060
after 10 pm neighbors don't stop by

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,640
randomly

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,799
yeah exactly it's safe to go get in your

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,759
grow room and smell like weed and yeah

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,799
exactly dude yeah yeah uh you mean it's

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,299
it's funny because you know I would

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,799
imagine from the outside and I've always

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,618
kind of looked at it like I wonder what

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,920
my neighbors think because like they see

40
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:37,140
this this young man who like barely ever

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,900
leaves the house never leaves on trips

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,700
never you know and is up at all these

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,840
odd hours like they must think of a

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,180
tweaker and that's just the only

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,740
conclusion you know well now nowadays

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,979
you can say you work online and that's

47
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:52,019
normal but back in the day 20 years ago

48
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:55,019
it's uh that you know we couldn't use

49
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:58,379
that excuse but yeah yeah that's hell

50
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,840
assessed 20 years ago right

51
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:03,839
yeah for sure

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,118
so I'm here with Jay from Next

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,560
Generation seeds formerly of federation

54
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,560
seeds and and who is with you

55
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,339
uh my friend Casey um he's been growing

56
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,259
uh other than growing his own uh death

57
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,780
Bubba for years he's been working with

58
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:21,120
different LPS uh big companies in Canada

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,459
doing a lot of the paperwork and doing

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,420
the extractions uh for quite a few

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,420
different LPS up here

62
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,699
oh nice I I love me some good bubble

63
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,439
gotta go over some bubble Tech because

64
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,439
that's one thing we have not covered at

65
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:41,098
all on this show is is yeah hash bubble

66
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,439
hashtag yeah and that's that's the [Â __Â ]

67
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:46,378
yeah I've been uh that's one thing with

68
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,139
growing uh seeds you always have lots of

69
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:51,299
uh samples of different hashes I've uh

70
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,799
yeah it's insane the number the

71
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,800
different grades and actually I have a

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,719
box right here

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,120
random uh

74
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,280
toad just just every different strain

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,379
you could think of uh different sounds

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,519
let's go through them let's go let's go

77
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,318
through and hear what kind of strains

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,939
that that are you you have over there in

79
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,439
hash form because it gives us a good

80
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,878
idea of what's going on over in your

81
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,098
territory as far as the strains

82
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,098
currently that you're into yeah well uh

83
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,699
different types of hash

84
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:22,738
um some are really good for uh for

85
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,018
pressing Verizon and some just like dump

86
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,420
the resin or just sticky right away and

87
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,920
then some no matter how good it is

88
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,559
um it just it won't press it'll still

89
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,238
always look kind of uh golden but it

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,219
won't actually get slippery

91
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,620
um so yeah it'll get like classy all

92
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,719
every all the way through yeah but uh

93
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,959
I'm really happy with one of the strains

94
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,419
I've done uh lately my red truffles okay

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,560
what's in this so it's uh it's uh the

96
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,919
Truffle strain crossed with the

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,959
Colombian red oh yeah and uh when you

98
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,079
put that in your hand and just it just

99
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,939
goes like a slick plastic with it within

100
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,519
seconds

101
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:00,900
it's an amazing amazing strain and I've

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,980
actually got a lot more of it going on

103
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,180
on the next round here so

104
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:09,780
yeah we're gonna do some fresh Frozen as

105
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,420
well but when we can

106
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,759
um yeah but 90 of my crop is usually

107
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,620
done for seeds so it's usually dry and

108
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,418
awful dry soup but even the dry soup

109
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,298
just you know some strains are pretty

110
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,879
powdery um the Greek god even though

111
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,539
it's one of the sweetest ones it just it

112
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:30,500
doesn't get slick and slippery

113
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,500
is that one more Sandy

114
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,599
yeah it is yeah

115
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,918
yeah it uh it's not like uh actually the

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,500
old Sweet Tooth was the same thing no

117
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,299
matter how great Sweet Tooth was and

118
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,339
being white and pure and it just

119
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,220
wouldn't stick together

120
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:52,379
um whereas the BC Kush would just melt

121
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,199
in your hands um

122
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:58,219
but the Sweet Tooth was a lot nicer

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,220
tasting but uh

124
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:05,459
it is wild how differently certain

125
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,400
strains will wash versus impress versus

126
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,138
others like you know um for example

127
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,179
there's the cookies and cream and stuff

128
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,800
like that has that same Sandy type resin

129
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,819
when I think of purples like purple

130
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,978
punch

131
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,659
um they have that same Sandy type resin

132
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:19,800
you know so when you said Grape God I

133
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,380
was thinking you know that that that

134
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,699
super purpley type resin I work with

135
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,759
that similar to the purple punch which

136
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,100
is super Sandy one okay yeah

137
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,259
yeah and a larger resin heads I I

138
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,039
recently got a new camera for doing

139
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:37,860
macro shots oh nice it was neat to see

140
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,439
uh all the different strains in the the

141
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,538
size of the different heads and and just

142
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,879
you know before we had these good

143
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,159
cameras uh we just never never got to

144
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,639
see that um no and it's kind of cool to

145
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,639
be able to understand

146
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,440
the head ratio and what you're

147
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,000
harvesting it makes a huge difference

148
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,100
right

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,199
so I was talking with one of my buddies

150
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,939
and this is kind of a random tangent but

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,620
it just it just sort of hit me and he

152
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,899
was over in

153
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,180
um where was it he was in it's either

154
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,579
Thailand or India and they were talking

155
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,360
about the land races out there how they

156
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:17,399
don't have as much it says they the the

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,860
farmers were saying that they look more

158
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,879
resinous but they don't have as much

159
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,520
heads per square centimeter square meter

160
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,379
square millimeter whatever it is and for

161
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,240
that reason the quality has gone down

162
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,879
that was that was their explanation for

163
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,860
why the quality's gone down so far in it

164
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,600
was in Milana so

165
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,240
um I was wondering is there any does

166
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,220
that even make sense I I don't know as a

167
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,538
non-hash guy or non-hashmaker is that

168
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,919
something yeah I'm not a big hash guy

169
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:46,500
too but I can tell you what I see from

170
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,079
my own strains um like yeah some of them

171
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,720
have uh much larger heads

172
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,459
um and uh smaller stocks but there's

173
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,220
some strange that they're almost all

174
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,939
stocks uh on the on the trichomes and

175
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,940
just tiny little heads

176
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:03,779
Casey's the professional on that um

177
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,418
that's it you're looking for those big

178
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,399
heads and like fire in fire out you know

179
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,620
like yeah the better the quality you're

180
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,138
putting in when you're harvesting that

181
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,120
low quality plant matter you're gonna

182
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,699
get other that automatically comes along

183
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,079
with that and if you only have a little

184
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,538
bit of this and a little bit of this

185
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,258
you're what you get at the end is isn't

186
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:24,259
the quality rate

187
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,740
and clean a little bit over this right

188
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,139
it's funny because like people people

189
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,418
are sad about breeding like you know uh

190
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,560
are Femme seeds better than red seeds

191
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,719
all right do you find that they're more

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,459
potent uh is this hash better and it's

193
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,500
just like literally you can break it

194
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,839
down to [Â __Â ] and [Â __Â ] out you put in

195
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,120
[Â __Â ] you get [Â __Â ] you put in good

196
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,098
quality and that is it whether it's

197
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,899
Femme seeds whether it's anything when

198
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:50,939
it comes to cannabis good quality gets

199
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,560
you good quality and that's it yeah I

200
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,839
I've never noticed a difference between

201
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,819
quality between the regulars and femmes

202
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,698
you know obviously I do vibrating with

203
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,280
the regulars um yeah Femmes are just to

204
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,780
grow out for people to grow but uh you

205
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,619
know but there is some breeders out

206
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,198
there who I don't know if they just

207
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,598
don't know any better or or they don't

208
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,580
care there is actually that actually

209
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,439
breed with feminized seeds

210
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,719
um and

211
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,300
I'm I'm still I maybe it's Bro Science

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,520
or I don't know but uh I just don't

213
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,960
breed with uh feminized seeds uh

214
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,598
everything's got to be selected all my

215
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,579
moms are selected from regulars most of

216
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,378
the um the Clone only is in today's

217
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:31,620
California Market or not even

218
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,019
California's the the U.S market all the

219
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,299
Clone only is in fact were found by a

220
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,240
feminized or bag seeds or you know like

221
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,519
accidents whether it's Sour OG any of

222
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,620
the cookie stuff anything modern at all

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,939
all came from it so it's just one of

224
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,320
those things that over time I think that

225
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,000
was definitely a way that people thought

226
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,260
at the beginning was like yeah use rags

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
to breed because at least you know you

228
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,899
get that extra chromosome and you know

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,639
you're not breeding out the female

230
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,379
chromosome whatever but over time we

231
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,539
realized oh it's just it's just that

232
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:00,059
chromosome is there and it's it's a

233
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,259
different it's autosomes taking course

234
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,838
over

235
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,879
um sexual chromosomes and that's just

236
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,800
kind of why it's fit so it's it yeah

237
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,539
there's not really any

238
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,099
it's the same kind of thing [Â __Â ] in [Â __Â ]

239
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,559
out so if it's a plant that naturally

240
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,060
harms a lot and will constantly kick

241
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,319
Herms of itself it's probably going to

242
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,479
breed a lot of Herms into it and

243
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,800
intersects into its future right but if

244
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,839
it's something that happens just very

245
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,639
rarely an errant one you know then it's

246
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,160
a lot easier to breathe with that

247
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,139
okay yeah well I tend to anything that

248
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,639
uh shows any herbs I tend to just toss

249
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,360
right away yeah

250
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,399
um

251
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,259
um but there is a few strains here and

252
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,059
there that maybe spit out a little

253
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:39,179
banana at the end

254
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,919
um but that you keep but I I really

255
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,778
don't have any except for I have one

256
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,659
different Fino of a purple Pine Berry

257
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:48,539
that I I don't really sell but uh

258
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,980
but yeah it got the last week or so it

259
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,379
puts a little banana but they're always

260
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,778
sterile but the bugs are so beautiful

261
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,860
and big uh it's hard for me to toss that

262
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:57,778
mom

263
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,879
um see is it is it seed maker it's hard

264
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:02,039
right because like we see all these

265
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,299
other qualities that are in Plants

266
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,919
um that have nothing to do with their

267
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,539
sex traits sexual traits like they could

268
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,278
have the most amazing resin production

269
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,500
we want to we want to carry that trade

270
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,480
on right like we want to use that but we

271
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,980
know that if people buy those seeds and

272
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,740
they find that intersex trait they may

273
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,899
not have that same like compassion for

274
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,459
intersex traits that we have so we just

275
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,399
can't work with it we just cannot have

276
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,778
it in our rooms yeah and uh as a seed

277
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,299
company you can't be selling people

278
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,799
things that uh go Herman

279
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,139
yeah because there's a lot there's a lot

280
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,399
of newbies out there and uh and they

281
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,000
usually [Â __Â ] up on a few different

282
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,620
things here and there um so uh that's

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,839
what something I really haven't had much

284
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,480
of a problem with uh yeah as far as

285
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,740
hermaphrodites or mutants um uh even

286
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,620
with I make my feminized with STS

287
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,860
and uh yeah and I had no problems like

288
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,620
people say like with the uh with the

289
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,019
other methods of making seeds sometimes

290
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,039
there's a few Hermes or they're not 100

291
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:04,620
female yeah with my formula on of the

292
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:07,078
STS I've had I've had no basically no

293
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,120
issues for about 10 years now

294
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,519
um you're starting with a lot of really

295
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,200
really stable stock as far as like

296
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,480
uniformity because they're lines you've

297
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,120
worked when I noticed a lot of the

298
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,100
intersex issues pop up is when it's

299
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,278
newer lines that are unworked like you

300
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,339
know doing a a hybrid between two brand

301
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,338
new crazy poly hybrids like animal mints

302
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,040
for us to I don't know Cherry truffle

303
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,839
butthole you know like you could you

304
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,879
cross those two then there's like all

305
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,920
this parentage below so all these

306
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,720
possibilities of plasticity come out and

307
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,740
intersex traits are abound you know like

308
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,480
that's the way I look at it and if

309
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,100
you're if you if you've booked lines

310
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,778
already worked out those intersex traits

311
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,680
and you're feminizing yourself then

312
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:48,299
they're going to be pretty freaking

313
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,799
stable but then they're going to have a

314
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,299
lot less Vinos popping up it's going to

315
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,519
be more true to what people want from

316
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:56,399
that product you know yeah what they

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,620
expect yeah when they go to your site

318
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,360
well a lot of my strains are uh I've

319
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,039
been working with for 25 years and I

320
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,379
haven't read them out to anything else

321
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,539
but obviously here and there I bring in

322
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,980
new like like the red truffles I brought

323
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,838
in because it was just so impressive

324
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,399
sure um

325
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,700
um but yeah I bring in new stuff here

326
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:18,480
and there but it has to pass uh a few

327
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,459
tests to get into the uh yeah into my my

328
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,680
mother room so look at it what kind of

329
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:25,799
tests are there like talk about some of

330
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,879
your um qualifications for bringing well

331
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,000
um

332
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,820
basically it's got a well as I we said

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,500
last time on the show um uh flavors and

334
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,019
the number one thing for me um the

335
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,480
Caribbean levels It's gotta taste really

336
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,560
really good from start to finish on that

337
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,778
joint

338
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,819
um that's number one for me before plant

339
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:47,159
structure before anything it's the

340
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,240
terpenes and the flavor

341
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,458
um

342
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,980
yeah that's right now actually one of

343
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,018
the ones uh I've been really pleased

344
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,399
with is our blue Dynamite

345
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,639
um yeah and I brought I brought that

346
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,578
back way back in 2007 it was all over

347
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,778
High Times and uh I wanted a few Awards

348
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,659
with it

349
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:09,899
um but uh I just recently brought it

350
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:11,338
back and uh we grew out a big batch of

351
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,159
it and uh

352
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:18,000
I selected five different females that

353
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,919
that I I wanted to uh rejuvenate yeah

354
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,720
and match the cones are out but after I

355
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,879
grow out the seedlings

356
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,220
um I picked my favorites rejuvenate them

357
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,559
and then try them as a clone before I

358
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,839
make my final selection and or try the

359
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,759
samples of each one set them in for some

360
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,860
tests um

361
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,659
back in the day we weren't able to send

362
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,839
them in for tests they no just didn't

363
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,338
exist but now nowadays uh nowadays we

364
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,579
get to do that

365
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,180
but before the numbers comes to flavor

366
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,919
um

367
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,979
I you know sometimes I don't care if

368
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,939
it's only 20 and not 24. yeah if it

369
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,839
tastes better

370
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,240
um

371
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,980
yeah you usually don't always agree with

372
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,919
you

373
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,180
um and uh

374
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,860
yeah if the terpenes are high you don't

375
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,778
notice those lower numbers as much

376
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,919
that's true

377
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,860
and

378
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,319
yeah well people uh people drink wine

379
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,419
and and not uh Everclear for a reason

380
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,778
it's not always about how what the

381
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:18,719
number is um it's about how you enjoy it

382
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:20,879
um exactly and for me like when it comes

383
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
to smoking taking the edge off is like

384
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,958
99 of the time that's all I want to do

385
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,480
is take the edge off not yeah yeah

386
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,179
inhibit I don't want to be uh cross-eyed

387
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,100
and confused and walk exactly

388
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,599
yeah I have to be able to function

389
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,639
sometimes

390
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,920
yeah there are times when that's very

391
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,419
appropriate you know yeah and other

392
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,099
times most of the time I have to run a

393
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,399
company and stuff and it's like yeah

394
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,399
yeah

395
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,440
actually I have some of that dude

396
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
um

397
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,778
tell on the camera but man this the

398
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:56,639
latest batch the cross I have now it's a

399
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:58,620
really good outdoor strain but purple I

400
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,220
don't know if you can tell that oh yeah

401
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,078
no you can't quite see it yeah okay you

402
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,778
know we just had um we had a big

403
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,120
breeders meet up about I think two

404
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,860
months ago now and one of the strains

405
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,740
that came in was blue Dynamite someone

406
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,720
actually threw a big like really nice

407
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,778
outdoor batch of blue Dynamite it was

408
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,120
really good I was it was very grapefruit

409
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,778
dominant super sweet pink grapefruit

410
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,879
super yeah um yeah exactly

411
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:28,919
original grapefruit so yeah that makes

412
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,600
sense and I was like well you know it's

413
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,000
great for maybe I won't get too baked

414
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,278
but I mean I was baked it did a damn

415
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,778
good job even I mean like I I don't

416
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,220
smoke a lot of outdoor because I've

417
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:40,379
always been an indoor grower and there's

418
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,120
not a big outdoor scene where we're at

419
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,399
in Bakersfield because it's so hot

420
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,560
nobody grows outdoor that much

421
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,940
um so I don't get to try outdoor often

422
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,500
and I wasn't I wasn't expecting to be

423
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,019
floored but it was really good there's

424
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,299
decent stuff that's good yeah yeah a lot

425
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,578
of our strange people uh people tend to

426
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,379
really like our strains for outdoors um

427
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:59,939
because uh because a lot of the

428
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,578
hardiness we have from uh the mold

429
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,279
resistance on the west coast

430
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:08,039
um Vancouver Island it's raining all the

431
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,980
time so in the first 10 12 years of my

432
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,659
my breeding career was all on the island

433
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,360
where it's everything's just the

434
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:17,458
humidity is through the roof so uh yeah

435
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,500
mold resistance is something I always

436
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:22,138
you know sometimes by accident but it's

437
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,940
something you select for yeah the Mendo

438
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,159
Growers love it and I know a lot of East

439
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,600
Coast Growers lately that hit me up the

440
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,059
one thing I've been telling them is just

441
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,159
like dude you like everybody everybody

442
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:36,359
that I know in Mendo that is in like

443
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:39,360
more humid situations they all grow they

444
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,740
grow next-gen seeds like they all do so

445
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,180
I've been I've been recommending that

446
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,060
for East Coast cars they're like man my

447
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,500
Situation's so humid I guess well you

448
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,359
know this is a great solution people

449
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,179
that have bred in this kind of climate

450
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,800
uh great strains good quality strains

451
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,138
for this climate this is what people

452
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,819
need to be thinking about not I wish

453
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,039
people would think more about that as

454
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,019
opposed to what's hype what will work

455
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,519
good for me in my area I think that

456
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,078
would solve a lot for a lot of people

457
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,900
and their issues

458
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,399
yeah well I've noticed that too we've

459
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,699
got a lot of feedback in the last few

460
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,259
years here um uh for outdoor Growers uh

461
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,640
even with our Auto flowers but also with

462
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:17,879
our some of our other outdoor varieties

463
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,579
like the Avalon blue Dynamite Time Warp

464
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,679
um streets are we're right on the on the

465
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:26,099
west coast uh

466
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,959
uh tend to be way way better for mold

467
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:31,740
resistance uh yeah you can finish them

468
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,779
in those Hills yeah yeah a colleague of

469
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,579
mine uh Ron Harrington with uh Golden

470
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,339
Hat seeds he's originally from Oregon

471
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,439
State and it's very rainy and humid

472
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:43,139
there just like it is in Canada on the

473
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,120
west coast uh and he uh he breeds a few

474
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,700
autoflowers as well

475
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,619
um and last year on his farm he did a

476
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,419
bunch of uh his own varieties obviously

477
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:55,199
uh and my grapefruit Haze and my

478
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,580
Dynamite yeah um alongside ethos seeds a

479
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,100
few autoflowers from them and a few

480
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:01,798
other American companies that aren't

481
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:04,859
from a human climate and yeah all of the

482
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:08,038
all the American strains molded yeah

483
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:09,240
right yeah and mine mine were my

484
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,038
grapefruit Haze was sitting in the

485
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,220
middle of a bunch of moldy Buds and all

486
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,099
of mine not a drop of but try this um

487
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,919
that's awesome so it's yeah and it was a

488
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,480
pretty wet year last uh last year so

489
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,880
but yeah that's what one thing that

490
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,400
people don't realize if you're on the

491
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,500
if you're going Outdoors on East Coast a

492
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,538
lot especially uh they'd really like the

493
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,980
uh the more molders because they get

494
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:33,839
more rain than you guys do down in

495
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,339
California oh yeah

496
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,079

499
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,079

truffles what what are some of your

501
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,379
directions you're wanting to take the

502
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,720
company yeah well I've got my Avalon

503
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,080
strain which is the tough hearty outdoor

504
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,019
strain um we've got some CBD in it now

505
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,819
we've crossed it out to a Spanish uh CBD

506
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,160
strain that I crossed it with and I did

507
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:03,058
a few back crosses now so we have a good

508
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,620
Avalon CBDs about 20 THC and about four

509
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,480
percent CBD

510
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,279
is Avalon um one of the more

511
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,360
grapefruiting ones

512
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,798
I can't remember which one it's

513
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,178
originally it was the very first strain

514
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:17,038
I ever bred back in uh was it

515
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:20,100
1996 I believe

516
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,940
um and uh it's a it's an Afghani hash

517
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:25,859
plant crossed with a blueberry

518
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,960
blueberry that's right yeah so but years

519
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:29,579
and years of selective uh breeding

520
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,038
outdoors I did all my selections

521
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,619
Outdoors on the west coast

522
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,900
um so it became really really Hardy uh

523
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,879
finishes about the end of September

524
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,759
um and you can put up with a lot of wind

525
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,100
and a lot of rain and yeah just down

526
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,200
like some straight uh we got a big news

527
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,359
terminals playing over but the Avalon's

528
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,660
standing up straight you can put up with

529
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,740
that so I bet it's that hearty breathing

530
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,019
dude

531
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,519
yeah yeah so

532
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:58,079
um and the other one uh while we're

533
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,839
actually working on uh our first Contact

534
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,599
strain we've got a doing a big pheno

535
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:07,079
hunt on that um it's a one the mother is

536
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,839
a one-to-one uh CBD THC strain

537
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:13,740
um but I've outcrossed that now to uh my

538
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,639
Romulan oh wow so we're testing that out

539
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,759
right now

540
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,759
um

541
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,480
yeah yeah but

542
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,900
what's that one called

543
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,519
uh first Contact first Contact okay yeah

544
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,980
yeah I kind of recommend that to

545
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,599
beginner smokers because it's lower a

546
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,298
little bit lower THC but this and the

547
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,980
CBD is really high but the terpene

548
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,240
levels on that strain are are through

549
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,579
the roof

550
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,819
um that's awesome really really stinky

551
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:43,500
and branchy it branches out like crazy

552
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,480
it's always a give and take a little bit

553
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,880
when it comes to to Quality and in

554
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,140
terpenes right like it's it's almost a

555
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,700
little bit of give and take it's very

556
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,520
rare that you see something in the high

557
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:56,340
high testing range with high high high

558
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,759
terpene percent it's very rare it can

559
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,899
happen actually yeah it's a yeah you're

560
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,640
right about that

561
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,620
um I noticed that with my grapefruit

562
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,020
diesel uh strain which is the highest

563
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,479
terpene levels I've ever recorded

564
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,240
um yeah just over five percent

565
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,620
um

566
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,660
that's extremely high

567
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:19,739
um yeah but the THC level is only like

568
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,120
16 or 17. yeah on but it's it's still my

569
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,819
favorite to smoke one of my favorites

570
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,379
yeah and everybody smokes it just loves

571
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:28,200
it because you know you're tasting that

572
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,780
flavor right down to the roach yeah and

573
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,340
so and everything I cross it with tends

574
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,200
to have about two and a half three

575
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,839
percent uh tripping level

576
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,000
that's nice

577
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,399
quite a bit yeah what kind of Terps is

578
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,298
it coming out with mostly

579
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,400
um

580
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:47,279
you know what I can't honestly I can't

581
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,320
really say honestly um yeah I don't I

582
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,119
don't remember in a while it's a new new

583
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,579
selection for a new mother so I haven't

584
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,859
sent that one in for testing yet yeah

585
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,899
I I rarely get to do testing just

586
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,959
because I'm so cheap that I just don't

587
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,820
but but I get customers that aren't as

588
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,220
cheap as me and every once in a while

589
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,918
you get those those cool customers yeah

590
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,600
we get a lot of feedback yeah we get a

591
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,340
lot of feedback too because uh over the

592
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,918
the last few years we've been selling a

593
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:17,639
lot of uh seeds to some of the big LPS

594
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,780
here um and they need they do do their

595
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,960
tests on it and they give us the

596
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:23,460
feedback so that's awesome that's that's

597
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,519
amazing to be able to get that much

598
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,500
feedback back you know and yeah it's

599
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,179
always it's always neat I listen to all

600
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,339
the customers getting back to us after

601
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:34,200
they grow in a crop and you know the

602
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,119
good reports the bad reports you know

603
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,279
it's we got to hear it all

604
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,619
um yeah but you know generally they're

605
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,980
pretty good

606
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:45,479
I I I hear a lot about LPS in Canada

607
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,819
um we've had a few guests on in the past

608
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,200
like our last guest Pete has talked

609
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,658
about LPS

610
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,880
can you kind of explain for us Americans

611
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:56,520
what an LP even is is it just a company

612
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,960
a cannabis company or yeah well in

613
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,819
Canada we have several different types

614
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,140
of licenses uh that are highly

615
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,899
controlled by the government there's the

616
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,900
lp it's a licensed producer so that's

617
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,179
right and then there's the micro Growers

618
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,600
for the people who are smaller like they

619
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:14,519
have a small medium-sized Warehouse yeah

620
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,899
and then there's a nursery license where

621
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,879
you're only allowed to sell seeds or

622
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,220
clones gotcha

623
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,799
but they're all highly highly regulated

624
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,380
by the government uh he in case you can

625
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,058
tell you more about that but uh the LPS

626
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,520
are allowed it basically covers the

627
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:32,279
whole gamut of being able to package it

628
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,558
you know a micro grower or a nursery has

629
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,599
to go to go to another company to

630
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,460
package it for you um they're just

631
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,619
fixing all that now like when I when it

632
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,940
first started you had as a micro you had

633
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,219
to go

634
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,019
to an LP or you had to get a processing

635
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,759
license and now you can get a sales

636
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,220
license so you have your own path to

637
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,980
sales but originally you'd have to go

638
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,779
through an LP which would have all the

639
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,779
licenses to be able to get you to Market

640
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,919
the one thing that blew my mind that I

641
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:03,658
found out about Canadian

642
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,720
um maybe this is just territorial I'm

643
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,280
not sure but was that the people who

644
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,579
were in charge of buying for the

645
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:14,099
government are like just randoms like

646
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:16,918
they're not weed people at all like and

647
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,658
every every Province or state as you

648
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,880
guys call it uh is different and

649
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,280
different regulations in every Province

650
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,020
um so yeah if I was that's one reason I

651
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,200
we still haven't gone for our full

652
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,879
license here in Canada is uh if we went

653
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,700
for our full Nursery license to sell

654
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,000
seeds and clones on the legal Market we

655
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,100
would be prevented from uh selling on

656
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,599
our website yeah we wouldn't be we

657
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,158
wouldn't be allowed to sell overseas

658
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,139
which is the majority of our Market is

659
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,679
overseas

660
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,500
um so for us the so right now I'm going

661
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,059
for a medical uh a few patients um so

662
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,859
that allows me to do my selecting and

663
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:55,500
breeding and then provide the medicine

664
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,579
for the patients but uh but the full

665
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,419
legal

666
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:03,178
market for us isn't really it's not not

667
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,759
the way to go so we're looking for

668
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,320
perhaps eventually here getting uh

669
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,740
moving out of Canada

670
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,720
yeah so uh yeah I've already got a a

671
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,000
location down in South America

672
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,360
yeah I started reading at

673
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,558
um but we've even considered uh working

674
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,339
in the states

675
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,240
um

676
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:26,099
so but you guys have the same thing too

677
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,679
every state is different yeah yeah

678
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:31,079
California's a nightmare man like they

679
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,179
the way the way that I think that it's

680
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:35,099
gonna wrap up is to where there's not

681
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,538
going to be any path for anyone to breed

682
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:38,639
because there's not going to be any kind

683
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:40,919
of plant count that allows you to breed

684
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,919
you know not nothing realistic like 12

685
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,620
you may get 12. but for a seed company

686
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,500
it's what we piss on 12. you know like

687
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:51,719
then we need 12 for one mom to stay

688
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,339
alive we need 12. you know like that's

689
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,558
not realistic

690
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:59,399
yeah exactly yeah we have uh two

691
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,798
licenses here for it's uh 317 plants two

692
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,679
licensed so we're just about well 635

693
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,538
plants we can do so that's nice that's

694
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,419
just that's just enough for me to work

695
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:12,679
with I wish I had more yeah I know never

696
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,679
enough right never enough

697
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,640
we're looking at a license in Argentina

698
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,700
where they when you get a license uh

699
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,100
they just allow you a flat uh two acres

700
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,038
uh do whatever you want on two acres

701
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:30,778
whether it's indoor outdoor Greenhouse

702
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,000
it doesn't matter

703
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:34,319
um it's simplified but uh but there's

704
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,640
other there's other steps they have

705
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,339
there too that are that are quite

706
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,080
difficult do they do they have like a

707
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,759
good power grid to where no matter where

708
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,439
you're at no matter where you live in

709
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,259
Argentina you can just hook up like a

710
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,200
[Â __Â ] big old indoor and blow it up

711
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:51,839
um yeah it's pretty good actually so

712
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,220
that's the uh well set up uh the

713
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,000
electricity cost is about the same as

714
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,740
Canada

715
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,759
probably a little more expensive than

716
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,659
the US

717
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,140
um

718
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:05,100
but uh you know there's no snow there

719
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:07,860
um yeah so uh as Canadians we like uh we

720
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:10,079
like not having snow oh you guys sick of

721
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:13,819
snow up in Canada no it smells good ice

722
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:16,678
fishing uh he's uh he's ice fisherman so

723
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:19,259
it lives in the woods but uh for for me

724
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,880
I absolutely hate the snow so yeah here

725
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:24,538
it gets up to like 120 degrees

726
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Fahrenheit here so like I hate the sun I

727
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:28,200
hate the sun I I could deal with the

728
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,259
snow because I can put on clothes but I

729
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,960
can't get more naked so I hate it yeah

730
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:36,419
100 yeah yeah [Â __Â ] that

731
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,100
well I'd rather be in uh shorts and

732
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,140
shirtless yeah yeah

733
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:46,019
cooking cooking I'm not a good Canadian

734
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,778
I guess I look at a Canadian or you

735
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:49,980
you've got a lot of snow and hockey come

736
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,240
on

737
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,038
so

738
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,140
let's talk a little bit about the lp

739
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,298
structures and stuff because I I that is

740
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,038
something we've never really covered

741
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:01,319
um

742
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,480
let's say you want to run a big Seed

743
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,879
Company up there what kind of license

744
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,099
would you need just hypothetically

745
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,900
though you know what I mean well I need

746
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:11,459
a nursery license like like the

747
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,380
warehouse that we're in I'm in right now

748
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,900
and working in uh we're about 90 percent

749
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:20,159
of the way having it built for a nursery

750
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:23,519
license and we we put a stop to that a

751
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,340
few months ago when we realized that uh

752
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,900
the market isn't here in Canada

753
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,538
um for us

754
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,278
um it just didn't doesn't make sense so

755
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:34,500
we're probably gonna that something

756
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,359
changes in the next few months we're

757
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,079
probably gonna wind down uh operations

758
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:42,178
here in Canada and uh move overseas uh

759
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,259
just the regulations are just way way

760
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,200
too tough

761
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:49,019
um yeah and uh like if the government

762
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,159
uh employee who selects the products to

763
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,740
sell in the stores

764
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,320
says uh nobody buys seeds so we don't

765
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,778
want your seeds yeah I can't sell them I

766
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,000
can't so that's no point to me that's

767
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:02,038
insane to me like oh this person do who

768
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,339
has no tap on the market at all says

769
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:07,319
today we don't want XYZ and that's your

770
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:09,178
main strain you're like what what what's

771
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,339
your input what's your context for this

772
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,380
they have yeah

773
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:15,959
in the province we're in here now in

774
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,059
Alberta I believe it's uh

775
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,360
a few years ago they took a bunch of

776
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:22,678
seeds in from some micro Growers and LPS

777
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,898
and they didn't sell very well in the

778
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,940
strain because basically everybody had

779
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:29,099
like one or two Strays it was all white

780
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,940
widow or a big butt or something like

781
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:34,859
that oh no and then they the government

782
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,899
said well these aren't selling very well

783
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:38,898
so we're not going to buy seeds anymore

784
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:48,418
is saturated too so so do you think um

785
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,340
so just from my perspective as an

786
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,140
American I noticed right at the

787
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:54,058
beginning of covid

788
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,399
um was when

789
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,259
the the drop happened as far as the

790
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,298
market in the U.S like that's when the

791
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:02,339
weed Market just bottomed out and it may

792
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,319
not have been it might be like it might

793
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,579
have just been a correlation causation

794
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,859
type thing where it happened at the same

795
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:10,139
time but whatever happened happened here

796
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:11,759
at that time like that was a very good

797
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,038
Mark to know when the weed Market

798
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,658
completely bottomed out yeah and it

799
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:17,700
affected

800
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,919
it affected the seed Market maybe six

801
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,380
months after that did it hit around the

802
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,600
same time there yeah yeah pretty similar

803
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,520
for the weed Market we are really legal

804
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,139
Recreation kept doing kind of its thing

805
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,519
I think it might have picked up a little

806
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,840
bit but I would say like on the flower

807
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,259
side

808
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,720
on the gray it would be down sales for

809
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,359
sure I don't know about seeds yeah well

810
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,120
and on the black market here uh prices

811
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,459
on the street dropped from about twelve

812
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,699
fourteen hundred dollars a pound down to

813
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,700
about

814
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,538
um and for five or six hundred dollars

815
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:55,259
that barely pays your electricity bill

816
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:57,778
exactly um it's not solid but a lot of

817
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:58,980
the a lot of the uh there was a lot of

818
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:01,259
stuff going on with the back doors of

819
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,778
the LPS sure

820
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,919
and the micros like how it always is but

821
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,898
uh

822
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,460
but now these days the customer the

823
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,199
customers in Canada have slowly just

824
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,720
moved they're lazy they go to the store

825
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,179
there's a store on every corner yeah um

826
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,980
and only the the good Growers and the

827
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,019
guys that are really weed Geeks they're

828
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,480
the ones still buying seeds but yeah

829
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,339
there's not as many of uh guys that are

830
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,919
just kind of doing it for fun

831
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,980
to make a little extra money on the side

832
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,980
um

833
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:34,679
I got two pallets of Lights here that I

834
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,278
can't even give away

835
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,159
no way 1000 watt HPS is I got about 45

836
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,778
oh I bet I can't even give them away

837
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,000
so

838
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,519
so yeah it's crazy right how quickly

839
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,019
it's lit how it was just like on its

840
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,298
head and then flipped all of a sudden

841
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:53,038
and yeah seeds the seed Market bottomed

842
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:55,200
out as far as I can tell yeah the seed

843
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,720
Market too yeah the seed Market for us

844
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,058
is it's mostly been maybe in the last

845
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,278
six months to a year is where we really

846
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:04,079
noticed a big change because we have our

847
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,880
whole we sell a lot of wholesale seeds

848
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,579
so what people want to buy whether it's

849
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,278
100 seeds or a thousand or ten thousand

850
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:12,658
uh our wholesale prices have just

851
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,359
dropped

852
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,919
um they're yeah it's crazy how much is

853
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,719
dropped um

854
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,580
so

855
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,220
anyone who hasn't dropped their price

856
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,778
per packs during this is is silly

857
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,480
because they're they're probably cutting

858
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:29,038
themselves off because it's it's the way

859
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,798
I looked at it was like

860
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,419
um seeds are a

861
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,819
they're not a

862
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:37,799
then you don't not everybody needs seeds

863
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:39,720
that are Growers it's a it's something

864
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,759
that they do extra when they have extra

865
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,860
space to select you know I want to find

866
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,019
something new but they can go get clones

867
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:48,000
down at the grow store for you know can

868
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,278
a pop so why would they need seeds it's

869
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,500
not something they necessarily need to

870
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,898
select new stuff every time they can go

871
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,179
get what's hot what's hip from clones

872
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:59,759
and that seems to be what happened when

873
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,440
everybody's money kind of vanished you

874
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,179
know in the US with covid and everything

875
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,058
else going on and the weed Market body

876
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:07,320
going out but seeds weren't so necessary

877
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:09,359
anymore

878
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,639
yeah well you guys down in California I

879
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:15,418
believe you can uh sell and buy and sell

880
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,740
uh cones in stores yeah yeah we we can't

881
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:19,200
do that in Canada

882
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,778
you know I I take that back because for

883
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,440
a while yeah yeah they're starting we

884
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:26,700
were able to I don't know when 64 hit I

885
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,038
don't know it kind of screwed everything

886
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,960
up and the last I I saw here locally

887
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,940
they were not allowed to sell clones

888
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,360
anymore but a lot of places do so I

889
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,399
don't know yeah it's one of those things

890
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,778
yeah they're starting to now like I've

891
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,319
seen there's some stores that have

892
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:45,898
setups to actually house clones

893
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,898
um to be able to move them and then I

894
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:50,099
think through the medical Market as well

895
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:51,599
companies can sell clones to medical

896
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:53,939
patients

897
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,379
but there's the logistics side of it

898
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,058
right depending on where you are it's

899
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,640
top break like to send clones through

900
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:01,558
the mail and exactly depending on

901
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,538
what you're getting right

902
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:04,678
yep and and who you're getting it from

903
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:06,778
because you just don't even know if it's

904
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,700
going to be what you expect and like I

905
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,619
mean if government regulations all up in

906
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:12,539
the middle of it that really [Â __Â ] it up

907
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,619
like super yeah because they really

908
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,199
don't know what the [Â __Â ] they're doing

909
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:18,960
they have no place in it like really

910
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,878
yeah I'm random what the [Â __Â ] does that

911
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,918
have to do with anything yeah the people

912
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,139
that made the regulations were not they

913
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,199
were not pot smokers or Growers

914
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,760
um just a bunch of bureaucrats it seems

915
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,219
uh yeah they're trying to figure out the

916
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,260
commodity yeah like they wanted to treat

917
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,000
it like Oscar Meyer ham and or what you

918
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,000
know anything else like that that's just

919
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,519
not how it works yeah yeah they didn't

920
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,898
really understand uh lead customers like

921
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,300
we customers

922
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,398
it's not like uh somebody who who drinks

923
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,039
beer every day and they go Budweiser

924
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:50,819
Budweiser Budweiser exactly and they get

925
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,460
a brand

926
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,619
weed smokers want to try something new

927
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,019
um all the time you know sometimes they

928
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,720
have their their reliable go-to strains

929
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:03,599
but uh yeah they want to try new flavors

930
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,279
it's not uh yeah it's not like that I

931
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,680
like the alcohol business and that's how

932
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,240
it was really viewed up here for a lot

933
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,098
of The Regulators they just seen it as

934
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:13,078
like like alcohol

935
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,640
yeah that's the way they viewed it and

936
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,380
that's not how it is

937
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,299
and that's how they try to treat it here

938
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,800
too and I think that's that's one of the

939
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,800
the big issues that they've run into

940
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,680
with like you know even driving trying

941
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,359
to you know figure out how to screw

942
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,618
people over and give them bwis for

943
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,659
smoking like they're having problems

944
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,000
with that how do you figure that out you

945
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:34,618
know yeah I've got some buddies like him

946
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,838
that I wouldn't trust them if they

947
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,720
weren't smoking and driving yeah right

948
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,279
yeah

949
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,379
it makes me a lot cooler like I don't

950
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,560
get all worked up about you know other

951
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,838
drivers a little less road rage eh yeah

952
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,820
I don't I don't I learned to chill out I

953
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,139
used to like as a young man what I

954
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,920
didn't used to smoke and drive a bunch

955
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:57,659
like I I get all Rowdy about like how

956
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,039
fast I was getting places and like ah

957
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:01,199
get out of my way and now it's just like

958
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,000
just chill you know with other people

959
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,098
that have them when I get there yeah

960
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,420
it's like what are you so worked up

961
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,619
about

962
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,900
yeah it helps

963
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:14,160
right on yeah [Â __Â ] yeah I don't I don't

964
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,680
smoke as much as I used to when I was

965
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:19,259
young but uh yeah a long road trip

966
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,239
always needs a few few puffs

967
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,980
so um

968
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,078
what's something that you smoked

969
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,699
recently that like not not necessarily

970
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,740
out of your own stuff but that you've

971
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,779
tried recently that really was like wow

972
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:34,459
that's different like that's a unique

973
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,460
strain has there been anything

974
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,760
um I I live in a bit of a closet here uh

975
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:44,039
a big closet with lots of plants but

976
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,660
so here in Canada I'm smoking most of my

977
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,940
own strains always

978
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,679
um yeah but in South America I tried

979
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,940
some really interesting streams down

980
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,259
there

981
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,000
um but what kind of strange did you try

982
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,220
down there

983
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,500
um yeah actually I quite I met a really

984
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:59,819
good grower in Chile uh what kind of

985
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,019
worker he's growing out a bunch of my

986
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,680
stuff right now but he had a lot of

987
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:06,480
different Jamaican strains oh wow and I

988
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:10,019
really really like a few different Blue

989
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,460
Mountain uh sativas and also he had a it

990
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,559
was interesting because he also has a

991
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,358
Colombian red down there uh oh

992
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,980
interesting and and I and I grow

993
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,139
Colombian right up here I've been in the

994
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,940
past and I'm breeding with her now but

995
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:23,578
it was it was nice to see that his was

996
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,039
very very similar to to mine oh that's

997
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:29,099
rad yeah it's on the other side of the

998
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:30,539
planet but uh it was yeah a bit of a

999
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,859
confirmation that I'm getting a bit of

1000
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,420
the real deal here

1001
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,440
um how long flowering is that Colombian

1002
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,480
red

1003
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,480
that's got to be about 12-ish

1004
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,820
yeah that's the one uh well we have a

1005
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,800
cross with it now it's the Colombian red

1006
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,559
crashed with that Mexican sativa that

1007
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,640
I'm calling uh Latina sativa

1008
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:55,320
um and that went about 13 14 weeks yeah

1009
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,960
and it probably could have went more of

1010
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,640
it yeah it could have kept going if it

1011
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,320
wasn't like done done like the rest of

1012
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,719
the room the rest of the room because I

1013
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,039
I when I was down in Argentina my Casey

1014
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,439
here was watching the crowd for me

1015
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,699
taking care of yeah some of the strains

1016
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,679
he's like Jay I can't keep these alive

1017
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:13,259
what's going wrong I said well it's 13

1018
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,299
14 weeks old and yeah that's why you

1019
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,520
attack you can't keep me because when I

1020
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,700
grow seeds

1021
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:22,920
I grow that plant so long until until it

1022
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:25,078
almost dies on the stick yeah get the

1023
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,059
best quality seeds and I fertilize to

1024
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,500
the end and he thought he was doing

1025
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,980
something wrong here for a while like

1026
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:34,460
yeah no no look at the date I put those

1027
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,659
in the room oh okay then figure it out

1028
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,300
that's funny yeah some of those

1029
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,338
Colombians go

1030
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,920
26 weeks every bit of it like there's

1031
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:46,739
there's some jungly Colombians out there

1032
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,599
yeah I I I'm a big fan of the sativas

1033
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:51,118
you know some some guys like the kushes

1034
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,720
and the indicators but I'm a sativa guy

1035
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,160
um

1036
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:56,159
I yeah I Can't Get Enough dude

1037
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,119
um yeah yeah I like the sativas myself I

1038
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,220
like ties and and very clear-headed type

1039
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,660
Highs but you know it's just a different

1040
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,578
different smoke for different occasion

1041
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:10,920

1056
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,400
can't wait to try out that was such a

1057
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,200
nice very unique strain man I haven't

1058
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,160
seen anything like it with those long

1059
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:52,980
long fingers yeah yeah it was just it

1060
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:56,118
was actually uh uh a buddy a mutual

1061
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,880
friend a breeder Steve and uh red uh

1062
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:01,680
burnt down people back in Vancouver who

1063
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,900
will know who burnt down is

1064
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,338
um okay he he had it sitting in the

1065
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,920
corner of his living room for like two

1066
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:10,320
or three years as a house plant yeah and

1067
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,220
he always like oh no he kind of ignored

1068
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,619
it

1069
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:15,059
um and it was just it stayed in veg just

1070
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,579
sitting in the corner of the living room

1071
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:20,039
and we took some cuts of it brought it

1072
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,200
back and he had never even grown it out

1073
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,179
I think reader Steve uh had had given

1074
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,059
him this cut and it's kind of just sat

1075
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:29,219
there for a few years

1076
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:30,539
and uh and it the story is it's from

1077
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,578
Ecuador

1078
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:34,139
um yeah but whatever you did with it it

1079
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:36,720
was hard to get it to flip into flower

1080
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:39,900
it would sit there and Edge forever and

1081
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,659
I believe that took about 12 13 weeks to

1082
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,280
flower as well but the high from that I

1083
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:48,059
remember the high from that it's kind of

1084
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,220
like a really a soapy spicy perfumey

1085
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:53,099
strain not not fruity or Piney at all

1086
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:54,539
yeah yeah and uh and it made it was kind

1087
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,460
of like some of my Jamaican strains I

1088
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,719
grew up it left me out I was kind of

1089
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,400
confused feeling

1090
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:04,618
yeah it's one of those trains that you

1091
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:06,300
don't dare do math yeah right yeah

1092
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,920
um yeah some of that stuff you have to

1093
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,660
like put your light hours down to eight

1094
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,700
or nine hours to get it to trigger into

1095
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:13,139
flower and initiate and just leave it at

1096
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:15,480
eight or nine hours so if you're growing

1097
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:17,578
anything else that like wants you know

1098
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,019
normal light hours it's just screwed

1099
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,960
because it's got a god flour with

1100
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:24,659
whatever that that one wants but though

1101
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,059
some of those have the most quality wild

1102
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:29,460
special highs and that's what makes them

1103
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:32,279
worth it that little weird chance you

1104
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,679
know yeah

1105
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,839
people don't grow enough sativas up here

1106
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,919
I agree

1107
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,380
there should be a lot more of them going

1108
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,480
around but

1109
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,700
that's not cool in the yard too and you

1110
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,760
get the great big sativas there's giant

1111
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:50,279
a few friends that grow them and they're

1112
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,140
but up here in Canada Outdoors we can't

1113
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,660
really finish them properly other than a

1114
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:56,519
few of the uh early sativas and a few of

1115
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:59,578
the strains from uh

1116
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:02,219
um a great white North and yeah Canadian

1117
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,900
bread seeds uh they did the uh yeah they

1118
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:07,078
did some early sativo it's basically a

1119
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,460
Durban Yeah Yeah from Manitoba and stuff

1120
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,079
like that um

1121
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,760
yeah there's a lot of good breed

1122
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,800
actually this brings me to the point uh

1123
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,880
when you had uh a peek there on the

1124
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,680
other day yeah yeah let's talk about

1125
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,099
something he was bringing up a few

1126
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,679
things about how uh about BC bud and how

1127
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,900
all the big players in BC back in the

1128
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:27,899
day or maybe even now but back in the

1129
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,960
day anyway they weren't from BC yeah um

1130
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,760
we all migrated from out east uh we

1131
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,519
always heard about okay you can grow

1132
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,359
weed in BC and not go to jail for too

1133
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,280
long

1134
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:39,960
so we all kind of migrate and the

1135
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,359
weather was better so we all kind of

1136
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,720
migrated when I was 20 years old the

1137
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,679
first thing I did me and my wife

1138
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,799
moved to the coast

1139
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:48,799
um

1140
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:55,139
but but most of Canada a lot of the

1141
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,420
biggest breeders and players in the game

1142
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,420
were not from BC

1143
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:04,220
um yeah

1144
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,220
legal uh climate and uh

1145
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,078
they're all a bunch of Alberta boys

1146
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,358
um Mark Emery is from Ontario a whole

1147
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,519
bunch of really top top grade breeders

1148
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,199
from Ontario from Manitoba which nobody

1149
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:18,719
talks about there because you could go

1150
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,098
to jail for 20 years for growing plants

1151
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,318
so there's a bunch of the big breeders

1152
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,838
from that rural Manitoba

1153
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:30,318
um man either at Bubble Man uh Richard

1154
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:33,239
uh what's his name uh Mark uh markerson

1155
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:36,900
yeah yes yeah Mark yeah yeah he's from

1156
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:39,659
Manitoba as well and uh yeah we're in

1157
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,240
the is the kootenase really big too

1158
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:43,440
yes yeah so yeah a lot of the Kootenays

1159
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,118
where they'll have a generational

1160
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,920
Growers that have been

1161
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,099
yeah their parents grew and their

1162
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,940
granddad grew um like our humble yeah

1163
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:53,760
yeah

1164
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,059
kind of and Vancouver Island is is

1165
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,680
similar to that yeah yeah where I like

1166
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:00,539
the mighty might boys there they're like

1167
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,299
their parents their grandparents they're

1168
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,259
all grew uh they were uh I think Vietnam

1169
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,579
War

1170
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,640
wow

1171
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:10,140
draft Dodgers yeah they leave uh the

1172
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,779
states when they got drafted so they all

1173
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:15,598
came up to Canada and so it's generation

1174
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,819
after generation of Growers um but yeah

1175
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,019
that's mostly the island and uh the

1176
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:20,818
Kootenays

1177
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:23,759
um yeah

1178
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:25,858
so yeah um yeah a lot of a lot of good

1179
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,560
strains but uh like when I moved out

1180
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:31,318
there I to BC uh

1181
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,719
I uh I did I didn't realize that a lot

1182
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,639
of my friends were lazy hippies and uh

1183
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:37,259
they didn't keep they didn't keep other

1184
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,539
plants around because they could just go

1185
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,579
to talk to somebody else and buy a tray

1186
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:43,679
of cones for the next Grill and and for

1187
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,800
me being from the the prairies where it

1188
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,318
was all rare I was just a rabid

1189
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,660
collector and I just got everything I

1190
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:53,159
could get my hands on my bedrooms were

1191
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:57,139
bigger than my flower rooms half the

1192
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,139
time oh same same always yeah

1193
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,460
they grew up with it was always there so

1194
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,440
they kind of didn't take it seriously so

1195
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,579
that's why I think a lot of uh us

1196
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,039
easterners

1197
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,880
um kind of came in and took over the

1198
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,639
market

1199
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,619
um yeah and even even when the Prairie

1200
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:15,659
boys or the East Coast guys uh had weed

1201
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,119
to sell to the states

1202
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:20,460
they just called it BC bud or beasters

1203
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,900
yeah um because you would never tell

1204
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,280
anybody that you're actually growing it

1205
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,920
it's like oh yeah I bought it from a guy

1206
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,060
in BC it's like that makes sense you

1207
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,619
would even tell your best friend that

1208
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:31,318
you were growing in your basement

1209
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:34,380
um yeah yeah that's how secretive it was

1210
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:36,420
back in the 90s so yeah yeah it's still

1211
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,880
that way here where I'm at like you just

1212
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,200
I'm all even all my friends know like oh

1213
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,880
we don't know where Matt lives that's

1214
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,500
what it is it's just you know they just

1215
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,500
know that's part of the drill you know

1216
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,940
yeah it's it's an old school mentality

1217
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,579
and I don't think it's probably not even

1218
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,800
necessary as much anymore but like that

1219
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:54,660
idea back then it was that you didn't

1220
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,599
want to end up on any one short list

1221
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:59,279
when someone's girl got robbed you

1222
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,599
didn't want to do that so it was like

1223
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,980
you didn't even want to ask someone

1224
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,838
where they lived if you knew they were a

1225
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,800
grower and if you're a grower you didn't

1226
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,838
want to talk about it because you didn't

1227
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,780
want to get ripped or robbed or yeah

1228
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:13,259
need to know only only need to know

1229
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,880
yeah and anybody who is going uh a buddy

1230
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,960
who is going through a divorce or split

1231
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,720
up with a girlfriend

1232
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,579
you was like okay bud no offense but I'm

1233
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,919
not going to talk to you for a year uh

1234
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:25,619
yeah because one of the most dangerous

1235
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,680
things was uh was when somebody split up

1236
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:31,140
um yeah and vindictive uh ex-girlfriend

1237
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,118
would just [Â __Â ] rack you out um my

1238
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:35,159
chick my chick has been mind blown like

1239
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,079

1241
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,039
of us that all met up around the country

1242
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:43,920
and she was the one story she heard in

1243
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,900
common was that we all have exes that

1244
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,700

1245

00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,838
over to Spain um

1259
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:24,959

welcome aboard living

1262
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:32,759
in Spain I was able to uh live openly

1263
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:34,739
and free I didn't have like Vancouver

1264
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,859
Island we had one couple friends that

1265
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:40,379
actually knew where we lived and nobody

1266
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,578
else really knew where I lived even

1267
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,720
though even though they were close

1268
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:44,220
friends

1269
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,980
um sure but

1270
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:49,618
in Spain nobody gave a [Â __Â ] like

1271
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,179
everybody was growing you'd never have

1272
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,920
to hide it I mean like I said the first

1273
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:55,019
tray of clones I sold in Spain was to

1274
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,358
the local police officer

1275
00:47:55,019 --> 00:48:01,318
um that is so crazy it was it was it was

1276
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:04,559
a non-issue what year was to your crop

1277
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:11,338
yeah hey what year were you in pain

1278
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:13,920
I believe I went there in 2008 okay the

1279
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:16,679
week that Mark Emery got busted he went

1280
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,079
there during the Glory Days for Spain

1281
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:22,279
yes exactly that's why I know a bunch of

1282
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,280
the big players in Spain yeah

1283
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:31,819
FM Royal Queen and all those guys yeah

1284
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:35,940
yep uh so yeah I was there 2008 until

1285
00:48:31,818 --> 00:48:38,338
2016 I believe oh [Â __Â ] 16 or 17. so yeah

1286
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,380
nine nine years living there so let's

1287
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:42,480
let's break into something I've I know

1288
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,579
I've mentioned it on the show before but

1289
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,440
it's something that is very often not

1290
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,359
talked about it's one of those golden

1291
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,338
rules to see things that like the guys

1292
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:54,420
involved don't want people talking about

1293
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:57,059
it but it's a reality

1294
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,680
can you talk about some of the big

1295
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,119
players in Spain who are making the

1296
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:01,618
majority of the seeds for the seed

1297
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,838
industry is that something you're open

1298
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:06,960
to talk about

1299
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:09,239
um yeah it's uh it's an Open Secret um

1300
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,880
anybody that's yeah close to it was um

1301
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:14,578
there's probably only a couple dozen big

1302
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,900
farmers that provide seeds for all the

1303
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:18,480
big companies because most of the

1304
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,338
Spanish companies well originally

1305
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,740
the Dutch were the big companies yeah

1306
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:25,440
and then they started farming out seed

1307
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:28,259
making to Spanish Growers because

1308
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,179
everything was cheaper in Spain and it

1309
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,880
became more illegal in Amsterdam they

1310
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,960
cracked down on it oh yeah and yeah the

1311
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,280
Dutch guys we're getting older too

1312
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,440
they've been doing it for 20 years and

1313
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,420
they want to retire it yeah getting

1314
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,920
older so they bring their clones down to

1315
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,480
a Spanish farmer and give you the Clone

1316
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,720
say hey can you make these seeds I'll

1317
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,159
give you 50 cents a seed and uh I was I

1318
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:49,019
was a proposition by a few different

1319
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:51,659
Growers too from Paradise and then

1320
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:53,460
serious to make seeds for them um

1321
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,460
I never did it maybe I should have but

1322
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:59,099
uh but yeah I know after the first one

1323
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:02,460
after the first five or six years or ten

1324
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:04,559
years of uh the Spanish guys uh farming

1325
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,420
the seeds they're like well

1326
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,420
forget these Dutch guys and the Spanish

1327
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:12,059
slowly took over the market uh and they

1328
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,500
stepped up to so but a lot of the

1329
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:14,338
companies down there there's a few that

1330
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,920
are

1331
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:18,900
that are breeding their own things and

1332
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,700
yeah aren't just retailers uh but the

1333
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,700
majority of the Spanish companies they

1334
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:25,139
buy it off a farmer and you know three

1335
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,239
or four different seed companies will

1336
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:30,960
have the exact same bag of seeds but

1337
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:32,818
I'll have a name that's similar yeah and

1338
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,039
what I noticed

1339
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:36,960
what I noticed was a lot of it started

1340
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,579
with like okay the the Dutch would bring

1341
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,800
like the drunkers would bring their

1342
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:42,599
clones down there they'd sell you know

1343
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,519
the seed lines would be true to what

1344
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,440
they were selling at the time but then

1345
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:48,119
like over time I noticed like Greenhouse

1346
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,559
like you'd never consistently get the

1347
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:51,358
same seeds in the same pack because they

1348
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,460
were just like give us something like

1349
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,139
Jack Herer like and well you know is

1350
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,780
there lemony a little bit Lemon Haze all

1351
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:58,858
right it's

1352
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,559
and they started to get a lot more like

1353
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:03,598
that and and I think it's probably one

1354
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,420
of the most open Secrets behind the

1355
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,760
scenes but on the front side most people

1356
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,039
don't know that they're buying from like

1357
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,380
12 breeders in Spain when they're buying

1358
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,818
these large large companies like the

1359
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,500
major yeah I don't even need to name

1360
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,759
them but yeah the large company yeah we

1361
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,559
don't need to name them because it's

1362
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,359
obvious if you look at the catalogs

1363
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,660
everybody's got a critical Cross or a

1364
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,519
silver haze or uh

1365
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:28,440
Amnesia something yeah yeah they're all

1366
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:29,639
they all come from the same bag half the

1367
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,200
time yeah

1368
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:33,539
but yeah yeah and a lot of the

1369
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,879
autoflowers too they uh the Spanish are

1370
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:37,739
really big on the Autos um they did some

1371
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,838
great breeding on Autos there really

1372
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:42,659
good breeding like they they made the

1373
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,219
Autos uh a good thing because yeah when

1374
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:47,159
autoflowers first came onto the scene

1375
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:49,919
they were [Â __Â ] yes they were tiny little

1376
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:52,379
runts um it was kind of a novelty uh at

1377
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,358
the beginning yeah um and that actually

1378
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,980
that a lot of the first breeders of the

1379
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:58,980
autoflowers actually were from Canada as

1380
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:01,740
well out in Toronto uh region I don't

1381
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,699
know know them myself personally

1382
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:04,439
um

1383
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:06,358
but I think a lot of the first Auto

1384
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,519
flowers that were marketed

1385
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:11,098
um like the low rider yeah yeah yeah

1386
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:12,780
doctors that was uh that was in Ontario

1387
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:15,359
uh guy

1388
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,240
um man I'd love to talk to that dude

1389
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:21,179
yeah yeah I have no idea what happened

1390
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:23,279
to him but uh I don't either

1391
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,899
yeah the Spanish guys brought it up a

1392
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,119
level and they they got better and

1393
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,400
better with their Auto flowers and uh

1394
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,400
and I started doing Autos probably about

1395
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,500
eight or nine years ago because the

1396
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,480
market demanded it um yeah yeah

1397
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,980
and all my all my friends I know a few

1398
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,380
of the big farmers that made seeds for

1399
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:44,159
like Royal Queen Dino fam sweet seeds

1400
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:46,858
pyramid seeds all the Spanish so I I

1401
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,239
ended up my first uh big run of the

1402
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:51,779
Autos was uh

1403
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:54,000
a big button uh Northern Lights yeah

1404
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:57,059
yeah and that's what I used as my first

1405
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
breeding material to to breed into my uh

1406
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:02,640
my strains was that Buddha seeds

1407
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,280
the Northern Lights

1408
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,400
no it's my buddy Louie's neighbor

1409
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,400
um

1410
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,980
so he sells to like three or four

1411
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:15,980
different companies that's awesome

1412
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,858
yeah yeah he yeah a lot of the farmers

1413
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,779
there will sell it to three or four

1414
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:24,960
different seed companies and

1415
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:27,839
and uh yeah that's the way it works a

1416
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,519
couple guys will get really good at

1417
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:32,039
growing a few of the strains that they

1418
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,960
like and they dial it in like I'm not

1419
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,300
I'm not gonna [Â __Â ] talk the Spanish guys

1420
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,420
they don't know I think they do great I

1421
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,900
think they gotta do good work um but

1422
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,880
but a lot of the deceived companies are

1423
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,760
different than the seed breeders and

1424
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,160
Growers um absolutely companies I would

1425
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,900
say 80 90 of them are just they're

1426
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:53,399
resellers and yes you're good at

1427
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,500
marketing but they're they don't

1428
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,599
actually make their own yeah I call them

1429
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,460
I call them seed sellers versus breeders

1430
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,440
like they're seed makers who don't

1431
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,599
really breed there's breeders who breed

1432
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,000
and make seeds and then there's seed

1433
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,740
sellers who are just resellers don't

1434
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,358
really have much of an interest in the

1435
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:11,058
breeding aspect they're they're uh

1436
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:13,259
they're

1437
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:14,220
yeah it's a business they run the

1438
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,160
website

1439
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:20,159
I often find it amazing how into seed

1440
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:22,679
making people get and how little they

1441
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,920
actually understand what's going on just

1442
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:28,078
behind the curtain you know uh in that

1443
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,659
regard like I mean it seems like when

1444
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,720
you talk like if I remember correctly I

1445
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:37,199
think it was 99 or 2000 the Dutch closed

1446
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:39,779
their law that made seed making legal

1447
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,460
yeah they had a loophole and then there

1448
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,099
was a bunch of busts and that seemed

1449
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:46,679
like it it shifted a bunch of people's

1450
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:49,260
work to either Switzerland or Spain

1451
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:51,480
but it's kind of been like a little bit

1452
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,220
that way the whole time like the whole

1453
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,740
reason most of that work even went out

1454
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:59,159
to Amsterdam in the first place was it

1455
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:01,318
was more permissive than the 80s and the

1456
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:04,259
Reagan drug war and all that and so it's

1457
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:06,480
almost like the the movement like looks

1458
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,619
for where it's liberal and they can get

1459
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,719
away with it

1460
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:11,220
get away with it just enough just enough

1461
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:12,719
just enough and then you know like you

1462
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:14,699
were just saying like you know various

1463
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,379
companies we won't name it it happens in

1464
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:18,719
America right now too where it's like

1465
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,119
people have a brand and they have

1466
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,818
packaging and they have a following

1467
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,338
right and so all they need to do is put

1468
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:28,739
seeds into that packaging and into that

1469
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:30,539
brand and into that following and people

1470
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,239
think that they did it from beginning to

1471
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:35,519
end yes when in reality they farmed it

1472
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:38,279
out you know and they're just buying

1473
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,780
from a menu because they have all that

1474
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,040
packaging and that brand and they're

1475
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,599
going to do a drop and they're going to

1476
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,599
do a collab and people don't understand

1477
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,640
people think that all these individually

1478
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,559
weed famous people most of them are

1479
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:52,440
making their own stuff and keeping their

1480
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:54,720
own mothers and like in-house working it

1481
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,800
yeah and it's like it's such an Open

1482
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:01,618
Secret but it's also like so like poorly

1483
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,780
understood by like 90 of the rest of the

1484
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:05,818
group out there and I I don't want to

1485
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,079
act like I'm [Â __Â ] on any and I know

1486
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:08,279
you guys aren't either like I don't want

1487
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,559
to make it sound like I'm [Â __Â ] on

1488
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,079
any of the um steps in this process

1489
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,180
because like each those steps of those

1490
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,980
process do their own thing and like

1491
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:18,719
they're making their own success like

1492
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,880
obviously some of these major companies

1493
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,439
that have people that don't make any

1494
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,300
scenes that have never touched a seed

1495
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,420
other than to resell them are the most

1496
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,980
successful companies so like yeah you're

1497
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,480
pretty funny because yeah a lot of the

1498
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,940
companies that sell a lot of the seeds

1499
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,480
they've probably never grown hardly 10

1500
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,760
plants exactly and even myself like we

1501
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,619
sell a lot of wholesale seeds uh for

1502
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,599
other companies they want to buy a bulk

1503
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:44,880
batch of seeds and they they package it

1504
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,700
themselves they're better at marketing

1505
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,338
than I am yeah sure there's a lot of

1506
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:52,379
people like that like reading so

1507
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:54,420
and most breeders are like that like

1508
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,519
just we're into the plant side like I

1509
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,099
I've had to force myself to get into

1510
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:01,139
like the podcasting side and the

1511
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:03,240
marketing aspect like none of the stuff

1512
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:05,179
I'm comfortable with at all I mean to

1513
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:07,379
some degree dude for a long time

1514
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:08,639
regardless of what country you're in or

1515
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,740
whatever

1516
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:11,818
um people that were deep weed people the

1517
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:13,979
best thing they could do was stay

1518
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:16,259
invisible and keep their head down

1519
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,300
yeah and so it's a very different skill

1520
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,460
set to be like oh get out there promote

1521
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:23,519
yourself promote your brand promote your

1522
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,980
company be the face of it so in a lot of

1523
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,780
ways like you know

1524
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,880
um it's it's just not it's just all

1525
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,380
different uh yeah if you want to survive

1526
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,720
in this business you got to change and

1527
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,300
uh I've been realizing that as well I

1528
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:38,759
have to be more proactive uh with social

1529
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,900
media or people don't know who who you

1530
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,020
are

1531
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:46,500
um yeah yeah I had yeah a few uh weeks

1532
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:49,259
ago I got on a stupid uh argument like

1533
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:52,679
you shouldn't do on Facebook and some

1534
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:54,300
some guy was uh telling me like oh I I'm

1535
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:57,779
the biggest player around here I move

1536
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,400
packs and I supply stores and I've been

1537
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,800
into this from the old days I've been

1538
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,660
around for like eight or nine years and

1539
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,940
I've never heard of you who are you I'm

1540
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:08,699
like you've been around since eight or

1541
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:10,500
nine years old yeah so

1542
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:13,618
you kind of engage with those people

1543
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,838
it's you gotta just ignore it and it's

1544
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:17,640
very hard though sometimes it's so hard

1545
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:19,920
and you just wanna because our culture

1546
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:21,358
we were raised different like it was a

1547
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,980
lot of us were raised with like an

1548
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:24,480
apprentice type culture where like you

1549
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,460
[Â __Â ] get your [Â __Â ] smack stop

1550
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,559
don't embarrass the people around you

1551
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:31,380
don't embarrass your culture well it was

1552
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,240
it was hard to get I mean I don't I I

1553
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,800
try to explain to people a lot and I

1554
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:36,239
don't I don't think it sinks in very

1555
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,760
much because we live in such an

1556
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:41,759
information dominated Society

1557
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,799
but when most of us started how

1558
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,700
difficult it was even to figure out the

1559
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:45,900
basics

1560
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:48,679
yeah

1561
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,680
yeah you know

1562
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:53,099
yeah you know there wasn't forums there

1563
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,139
wasn't the internet there wasn't the

1564
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:58,260
exchange of ideas yet or anything like

1565
00:58:55,139 --> 00:59:01,259
that and because it was so risky getting

1566
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:05,299
into a trusted Circle was hard and

1567
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,299
almost by accident more than intention

1568
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:13,559
we kept our Circle small because it was

1569
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,480
just too risky to uh have a big circle

1570
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:18,780
yeah

1571
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,400
yeah but uh yeah but I you know I I I'm

1572
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,740
not and I just want to make everybody

1573
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,559
clear like I'm not dissing anybody in

1574
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:27,000
Spain it it's mostly you know like

1575
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:28,440
because probably some of those Spanish

1576
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,239
breeders and some of those Spanish

1577
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,760
farmers are really good at what they do

1578
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,919
yeah I know if you're really Kick-Ass

1579
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,720
Growers and breeders in Spain um you

1580
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,000
know so it's not to disparage them it's

1581
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,679
just more like like you know you've got

1582
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,358
these these Brands we don't need to

1583
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:44,639
mention them but you got some big brands

1584
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:46,858
that like kind of ruled the 90s from

1585
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,719
Holland yeah and then they start getting

1586
00:59:46,858 --> 00:59:50,519
busted and they're getting older like

1587
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,679
you said and they like they kind of lost

1588
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:55,259
their Verve for it but they have this

1589
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:57,838
brand and they can sell a lot of seed

1590
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,640
and so you know you talk to a lot of the

1591
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:03,199
Dutch and they'll never claim that they

1592
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:05,879
lost a single thing sure yeah

1593
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,919
okay yeah the original parents

1594
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,039
everything I mean why admit that you

1595
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,659
lost anything 40 years in running I mean

1596
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,338
what's funny is you know I mean I guess

1597
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:17,039
I'll discense you for a second or

1598
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:19,619
whatever but like no they still if you

1599
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,599
go on their web page today they still

1600
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:24,358
use the same pictures that Neville had

1601
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,880
in his seed bank catalog in 89 and 90.

1602
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:30,798
yeah yeah they haven't updated their

1603
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,798
Super Skunk picture in 35 years

1604
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,598
some of the bigger ones I know

1605
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:39,298
Greenhouse my my uh my business partner

1606
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,039
is uh he's a friend with uh Ari and he

1607
01:00:39,298 --> 01:00:42,659
ran time seat back for the day and he

1608
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,940
used to move a lot of their the seeds

1609
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:47,519
for Ferrari and and he's been in their

1610
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:50,039
mother room he said there is these trees

1611
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:52,858
and Aryans uh main mother room that are

1612
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:54,058
they're trees they've been going for

1613
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:56,598
years and years and there's a few

1614
01:00:54,059 --> 01:01:00,660
companies that have the original cuts um

1615
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:03,298
but most probably don't and I know we

1616
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:06,058
all we all know we all lost strains that

1617
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:09,119
we uh that we produce but let's be

1618
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:09,900
realistic like Greenhouse are the ones

1619
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,838
that

1620
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:15,119
are probably the most notorious for

1621
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:16,980
doing the white labeling of seeds I have

1622
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,380
never understood why Ariane would heat

1623
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,059
moms of anything for that long when he

1624
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,500
doesn't even sell seeds of the [Â __Â ] that

1625
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,059
he's keeping these moms because he

1626
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,940
probably does it all dude

1627
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:28,740
I mean yeah maybe he does but it doesn't

1628
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,780
make sense in my head like I see them

1629
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:32,098
doing the The Strain Hunters and I don't

1630
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,740
I don't want to diss the dude because

1631
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:36,240
he's done a lot I guess you know but um

1632
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:37,739
I see Strain Hunters I see them

1633
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,779
collecting all these land race strains

1634
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:41,279
but I've never seen like these big

1635
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,780
massive reproductions of all these

1636
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,579
streams I've seen them vaulted is what

1637
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,220
I've said that that dude is I couldn't

1638
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:50,099
say for sure but he probably is the most

1639
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:51,899
as far as the public people go he's

1640
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:55,880
probably the most successful business

1641
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,880
person in cannabis sure

1642
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,280
Franco had a heart for weed he uh he

1643
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:10,920
really he was a weed geek I never met

1644
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,960
him jars and samples in front of him and

1645
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,700
he was just passionate about it and he

1646
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,639
could smell everything and he would go

1647
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:20,098
on about it Aryan barely maybe spoke the

1648
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,980
odd joint in the evening

1649
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:25,619
um he's the businessman you know the the

1650
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:29,519
great face behind it but but uh Franco

1651
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:31,200
he was the real deal I saw it yeah but

1652
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,818
uh like just like nowadays I actually

1653
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,679
talked to Aryan when I was down in South

1654
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:38,219
America at the trade show it was down

1655
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:41,058
there and him he a lot of the seeds now

1656
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:41,058
are made in Colombia

1657
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:48,539
when I told him I had oh I got a couple

1658
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:50,279
hundred thousand autoflowers you're

1659
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:51,960
ready to move blah blah blah and he

1660
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:56,700
looked at me and laughed he goes I got a

1661
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,679
barrel full yeah he's like okay well

1662
01:02:56,699 --> 01:03:00,558
okay

1663
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:03,419
yeah

1664
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,280
a farmer you can you can look at that

1665
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,740
and it's like that's always I actually

1666
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,960
look at Holland and Amsterdam I look at

1667
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:11,939
all the eras as like teaching moments in

1668
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,159
a way because it doesn't really change

1669
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,318
that much and even like living in

1670
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:18,318
California and having like legalizations

1671
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:20,818
sort of start to sweep through America

1672
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:22,858
all the same stuff that was happening in

1673
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:24,960
the 90s and Holland is happening here

1674
01:03:22,858 --> 01:03:27,420
now yeah you've got your like

1675
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,099
underground weed nerds that just want to

1676
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,260
like have a good living and work with

1677
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:33,780
plants and they have to bond with like

1678
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:36,180
sort of straight business people that

1679
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:38,280
don't care nearly as much but have that

1680
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:41,399
aspect or have sides of like they have

1681
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:44,760
access to Capital or money or the things

1682
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,980
that you don't and from you know yeah

1683
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,500
that's one reason why like about five

1684
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,780
six years ago I moved back to Canada uh

1685
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,059
a few of the big uh companies here the

1686
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,680
big LPS were kind of courting me and

1687
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:57,780
trying to get me to come grow for them

1688
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:59,818
uh but I would have had to sell out all

1689
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:02,280
my genetics

1690
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:03,420
um and give them my my strains and I

1691
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,819
would have just started making a wage

1692
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,680
maybe a percentage of a big company I'd

1693
01:04:05,818 --> 01:04:10,139
maybe make five percent shares from the

1694
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,818
company or something sure and uh and I

1695
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:13,920
kind of uh

1696
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:17,039
after a few of them came to me I that's

1697
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,318
why my partner now uh Taylor uh

1698
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:22,079
I chose him as a partner because he ran

1699
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:25,380
kind seed really really well yeah he's

1700
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:27,539
old school he knows how he knows how to

1701
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,280
he's anybody who talks to him on the

1702
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:32,599
phone when they call our website

1703
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,519
uh Taylor's the most friendly guy Taylor

1704
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:36,539
yeah yeah when you talk to him man on

1705
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,179
the phone

1706
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:41,338
your best friend after 10 minutes on the

1707
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:42,838
phone and he's a bit of a big soft teddy

1708
01:04:41,338 --> 01:04:44,279
bear here and he'll he'll always give

1709
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:45,900
you free stuff

1710
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,720
um yeah which is fine and but he's

1711
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:50,099
somebody who I know will uh can deal

1712
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,719
with her customers so I teamed up with

1713
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:53,640
him even though he didn't have

1714
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:55,919
the funds and it was a bit of a slower

1715
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:58,379
rise to get back into the game over here

1716
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,760
in Canada but when he has when he's on

1717
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,140
the phone with a customer it's one of

1718
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,940
our rules

1719
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:05,338
um like when I teamed up with him years

1720
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:07,318
ago he's like there's no [Â __Â ] um

1721
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:09,599
like the cus customer asks something

1722
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:11,880
about a strain if you don't know just

1723
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,440
tell them you don't know

1724
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,818
um and he even said that to me yesterday

1725
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,980
I told him we were going on the podcast

1726
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:18,539
he goes Jay just don't say anything

1727
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,460
that's not true if you don't know

1728
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:22,079
something don't worry and it's the

1729
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:24,240
advice I gave him and he gave that yeah

1730
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:27,180
like it's just something beautiful isn't

1731
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:29,578
it to be in this business for this long

1732
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:31,980
people see that [Â __Â ]

1733
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:34,318
um they do and there's no shame in

1734
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:36,900
admitting you don't know what where that

1735
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:39,539
strain came from or what crosses what

1736
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:43,139
exactly you tell people what you know

1737
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:45,358
and and that's it so one thing that

1738
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:48,480
that's held true on our podcast since

1739
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,460
day one is that our it's been at least

1740
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,920
the people who are serious weed nerds

1741
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,780
and that appreciate our show is that

1742
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,338
they always sense when someone's being

1743
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,780
transparent and just being like yeah I

1744
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:59,338
don't know you know like I just tell it

1745
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:01,680
the way it was and you can always see it

1746
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:03,960
in the comments everybody always is like

1747
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,759
yep yep this guy's not a bullshiter

1748
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,619
appreciate it you know all the time yeah

1749
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,900
that's what I think that's right yeah

1750
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:11,880
last night when I was watching uh uh

1751
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:14,099
Pete there on there yeah yeah it was 20

1752
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,039
minutes 20 minutes into the podcast like

1753
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,240
oh this guy's not a bullshiter nope he's

1754
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,818
a real deal

1755
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,219
um yeah no [Â __Â ] defeat

1756
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:24,900
yeah yeah yeah I I actually like that

1757
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:26,939
it'd be interesting to have a little

1758
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:29,280
podcast with me and him chatting because

1759
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:32,280
he knows a lot about the Ontario scene I

1760
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,180
know that BC scene better and uh we

1761
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,700
could probably

1762
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:37,078
say that together we have all the mutual

1763
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:39,058
friends

1764
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:40,798
um but yeah it'd be pretty interesting

1765
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:43,019
to actually to chat with him sometime

1766
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,019
yeah that'd be great I'm sure he'd enjoy

1767
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:47,639
it too he loves it

1768
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:49,798
yeah he's an old dork like yeah I only

1769
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:50,940
watched uh one podcast of his but I

1770
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:54,599
think you guys have about two or three

1771
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:57,358
yeah I think we did Total yeah

1772
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:58,920
yeah with him it's just he's got so much

1773
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:00,779
information in there it's just about

1774
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,280
keeping him on point you know because

1775
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,140
he's like he'll start talking about

1776
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,819
something and then he'll get a thought

1777
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:08,098
in his head and all of a sudden you're

1778
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:09,599
like 45 degree angle you're off on a

1779
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:11,059
tangent about something totally else

1780
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:15,720
yeah

1781
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:17,640
don't we yeah you know and he yeah I

1782
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:20,038
like that he gives unvarnished opinions

1783
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:22,679
of what he thinks about people you know

1784
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:24,180
yes that's my favorite you know because

1785
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,399
it's like a lot of times one of the

1786
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:28,558
hardest things about like doing a show

1787
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,740
like this is like you're trying to get

1788
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,480
information across right and people come

1789
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:34,919
on for different reasons or whatever you

1790
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,980
know but it's like it's very difficult

1791
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:40,139
to be like just real and and what I mean

1792
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:41,880
by that is to not just like make it's

1793
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:44,759
really tempting to make yourself look

1794
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,500
better than you are yeah you know

1795
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,440
there's no need for that there's no need

1796
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:51,000
for that it hurts you in the long run as

1797
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,460
any of us know it's like a lot of

1798
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,159
breeding is accidents a lot of breeding

1799
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:58,139
is failure you know a lot of breeding is

1800
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,899
like you wish you had the things you had

1801
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:02,519
back then now because you do a better

1802
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,500
job with them now than you would have

1803
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:06,179
done 15 years ago when you were still

1804
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:09,420
just figuring it out

1805
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:12,058
and you know it it uh I actually think

1806
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:14,220
it's amazing how much cool stuff has

1807
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:16,319
come out of cannabis

1808
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:18,778
um despite like most of it coming out of

1809
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,819
garages or little warehouses or little

1810
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:22,380
Greenies

1811
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:24,179
yeah I mean when I was first going when

1812
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:26,219
I was first going to Holland I just had

1813
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:29,100
no idea that like every five or six

1814
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:30,420
years weed would reinvent itself

1815
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,100
and

1816
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,100
I mean and this and what I mean by that

1817
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,480
is that like if you don't get seeds when

1818
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,759
they're available

1819
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,500
you have no idea if those seeds with

1820
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:42,600
those parents will ever be around again

1821
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,698
well I mean that changed over time

1822
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,380
though it accelerated the the process of

1823
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:49,500
how quick strains turned over

1824
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:51,838
accelerated I mean OG Kush lasted 20

1825
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,579
freaking years like white widow lasted

1826
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:56,399
you know 20 freaking years but now it's

1827
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:58,798
like cookies and then runs then you know

1828
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,019
this and that it's going way faster the

1829
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:03,238
fads are going faster I think yeah I

1830
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:07,259
think that's modern marketing yeah yeah

1831
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:11,159
it's just marketing for newbies um yeah

1832
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:13,679
yeah but but yeah like uh actually to go

1833
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:16,198
back to uh what Pete said about uh

1834
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,359
I'm gonna add the tangent here as well

1835
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:20,278
but uh what Pete said about Mark Emery

1836
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:21,960
and back in the day

1837
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:24,359
um you made some really good points and

1838
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,698
uh like to clarify like last the last

1839
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:28,380
podcast we were chatting and uh I was a

1840
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:31,198
little bit vague about some of our my

1841
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:34,319
history back in the day uh working with

1842
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:36,178
Emery but uh I don't have to be that big

1843
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,279
but uh yeah for about a year or so like

1844
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:39,539
the Federation when I split from

1845
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:42,719
Federation

1846
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:46,198
um it was a big uh argument I had with

1847
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,939
with Mark and with Mike from Federation

1848
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:51,059
um because uh we I was out of the city

1849
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:53,879
uh for for about a month or so and I

1850
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:56,340
came back and my partner at Federation

1851
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,760
had a bunch of strains on Mark Emery's

1852
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:02,159
catalog that I know did not exist oh

1853
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,260
that sucks dude you just renamed him and

1854
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:07,019
I uh yeah and that was the last straw

1855
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,060
and I went in I I went in I told Mark

1856
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,100
hey Mark I'm done with Federation me and

1857
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,679
Mike are split I'm starting my own seed

1858
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,480
company and by the way all those crosses

1859
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,579
that you have there in the catalog they

1860
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:20,339
don't actually exist

1861
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:22,920
um they're just renamed seeds because

1862
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:25,020
Mike wanted to make some money and Mark

1863
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,760
did not care he goes oh well no of

1864
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,800
course

1865
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,300
yeah and uh and I was like and then and

1866
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,760
that's where I start I stopped selling

1867
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:35,820
uh seats to mark that was that that same

1868
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:38,219
day I was done uh so I went over to kind

1869
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:42,198
seed I started selling the kind seeds uh

1870
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:45,480
Amsterdam Seed company or Amsterdam Cafe

1871
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:47,939
and a few a few companies online in

1872
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:51,479
Ontario but I I stopped selling to Mark

1873
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:54,238
Emery that that very same day and that's

1874
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:55,799
awesome it was only about probably about

1875
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:58,379
five or six years later when I don't

1876
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:02,460
know if you guys know uh Michelle Rainey

1877
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:04,679
no she came up she anyway she came to uh

1878
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:07,198
uh Vancouver and she took over the

1879
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:09,960
business end of Markham recedes in uh

1880
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:12,419
okay probably the mid-2000s

1881
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,640
and now okay and she she ran it straight

1882
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:17,039
and because Mark was too busy doing his

1883
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,380
political [Â __Â ] oh yeah yeah I was

1884
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:22,019
getting into trouble and blowing money

1885
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:23,819
um so when Michelle took over she ran it

1886
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,980
straight and she was honest about it so

1887
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:28,738
that's that's why I went back into the

1888
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:31,259
Emory catalog but before that from about

1889
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:34,738
1999

1890
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,840
Joe 2005 I never sold to mark because I

1891
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:40,459
I knew what was up you know what I got

1892
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,460
to ask don't you yeah

1893
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:44,939
what what strains were on the list what

1894
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:48,540
strains are on the list

1895
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:50,399
oh dude I can't you know what

1896
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:53,158
it was about four or five of them that

1897
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:56,519
he had I I can't really remember

1898
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:59,279
um had to though had to try I'd have to

1899
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,900
[Â __Â ] I I actually I do have some of my

1900
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:02,399
the old Emory catalogs here I could

1901
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:05,639
probably figure it out by looking at the

1902
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,698
old catalogs but uh off the top of my

1903
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,840
head

1904
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:11,279
yeah of course like they weren't they

1905
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,920
weren't your Creations so why the [Â __Â ]

1906
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,479
would you care to me that's always been

1907
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,100
the risk of like when you're buying

1908
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:20,039
especially from different countries and

1909
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,780
stuff and like an order comes in for you

1910
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:24,479
know eight packs of this and they don't

1911
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:25,679
have it but they have other seeds and so

1912
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:27,479
they're like well I'll just take the

1913
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,300
money and I'll fill this order with this

1914
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:32,698
is close enough and off it goes and

1915
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:35,039
and you know that's a slippery slope

1916
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:37,198
indeed

1917
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:40,260
I always tell people unless it's a

1918
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:43,319
really big established company if if a

1919
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,219
company online always has a strain in

1920
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:46,979
stock

1921
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:49,020
chances are they're bullshitting

1922
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:51,178
um like as a breeder myself too like

1923
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,460
sometimes you run out of seeds and I I

1924
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:56,158
don't have room in my group you make

1925
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:57,179
that strain for another six months so

1926
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:59,339
yeah

1927
01:12:57,179 --> 01:13:01,500
you can't always have every strain in

1928
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:03,900
stock unless you have an insanely well

1929
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,100
organized large operation

1930
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:07,939
um that's the one thing I tell people

1931
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,940
when they ask me

1932
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:14,340
yep when when people ask me what's one

1933
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,880
thing I can look for to know if a seed

1934
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:19,380
company has uh is reputable and I'd say

1935
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,359
well look how long they've been around

1936
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,140
and has any other stuff ever gone out of

1937
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:23,698
stock

1938
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,900
that'll that'll give you your answer

1939
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:26,759
yeah

1940
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:29,158
I mean I mean it's not always true

1941
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:32,039
because there are amazing people who can

1942
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:33,779
keep their stuff in stock and much

1943
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:36,000
better than I ever could obviously but

1944
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:37,500
yeah for the most part if they're doing

1945
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,899
it legit they're gonna run out of stock

1946
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,460
and stuff every now and then

1947
01:13:39,899 --> 01:13:43,379
and you know sometimes you're doing

1948
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:45,719
regular if if you're doing regular

1949
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:48,000
breeding sometimes you get like a

1950
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,800
prolific amount of seeds as he was just

1951
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,479
talking about and you you might have a

1952
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:55,739
55 gallon drum

1953
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:57,419
like he was saying like full of whatever

1954
01:13:55,738 --> 01:14:00,238
um and then you're not gonna run out you

1955
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:02,279
know so yeah it's just unpopular yeah

1956
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:04,319
you know right but you but you can't

1957
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,539
really sell them after three years or so

1958
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:09,658
the germination rate goes down if you're

1959
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:11,219
not starting them right sure yeah every

1960
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:14,158
here's when you start seeing the dip in

1961
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:16,340
the germination rate um

1962
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,719
that's what I found I mean

1963
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:21,360
yeah yeah

1964
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:23,399
yeah if they're not fridge stored people

1965
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,319
don't understand like how quickly like

1966
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:28,019
because they can go from being real nice

1967
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:30,059
to just but all of a sudden a month

1968
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:31,560
later nothing's popping I saw it happen

1969
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,820
with a lot of my old strawberry stuff

1970
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,840
for whatever reason all at the same time

1971
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:36,539
it just

1972
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,520
take a [Â __Â ] and that was that can't sell

1973
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:40,198
anymore

1974
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,580
one of the things I think is interesting

1975
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:43,198
about three things too it's about

1976
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:44,880
stability

1977
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:47,219
yeah

1978
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,420
I just I was just saying that like one

1979
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:50,939
of the big shifts at least that's

1980
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:53,279
happened in America is like a lot of the

1981
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:55,198
old school people have what I call you

1982
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,698
know they have lines right and like you

1983
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:58,919
were saying you have lines and You

1984
01:14:56,698 --> 01:15:01,619
remake those lines at different times

1985
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,359
for new seed a lot of the smaller

1986
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:07,079
breeders these days everything is a

1987
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:09,359
one-off yeah everything is made once and

1988
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:11,158
it exists until it's gone and the

1989
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,679
likelihood they ever make it again is

1990
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:16,500
very small yeah you know because they're

1991
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,539
not really naked

1992
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,158
yeah and when they do remake it it's a

1993
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:23,399
different phenotype

1994
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:25,139
yeah exactly so it's become very flash

1995
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:28,139
in the pan in that way where people

1996
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:30,119
advertise a drop and if you want that

1997
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,579
hybrid you better get it then because

1998
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:34,559
you know it's not like the old Seed

1999
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:35,698
Company days in America at least for a

2000
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,380
lot of people where it's like I have

2001
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:40,079
these age drinks

2002
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,340
here are the lines I offer yeah yeah you

2003
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:44,158
know and I've been working on these

2004
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:46,679
lines for quite a while

2005
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:49,019
um and so you know but but strangely

2006
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:51,420
people want worked lines but they also

2007
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:53,760
want new stuff every single drop yeah

2008
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:55,980
yes that's what I ran into and that's

2009
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,020
why I said with the with the blue bonnet

2010
01:15:55,979 --> 01:15:59,759
[Â __Â ] I was like I'm done I'm done I'm

2011
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,560
not changing anymore I'm just staying

2012
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,659
because either way I'm not winning so

2013
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,179
I'm just gonna stay here see how it

2014
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:08,099
holds yeah stick him a gun and I wish I

2015
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:10,380
had some of the same Cuts I had back in

2016
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:12,900
the 90s and I would have stayed there

2017
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:14,819
with a few of those strands because you

2018
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:17,519
can't get any better you only knew it

2019
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:20,639
yeah if you only knew right right like

2020
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:23,040
some of those older lines from Neville

2021
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,900
I mean Matt and I were talking to

2022
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:26,819
someone that was uh you know very close

2023
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:28,139
to Neville the last you know decade or

2024
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:31,738
so of his life

2025
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:33,719
and even he bitched about he wished he

2026
01:16:31,738 --> 01:16:37,500
had a lot of the stuff he had in the 80s

2027
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:39,779
and early 90s now yeah because you got

2028
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:42,420
you know 30 years of reading in and man

2029
01:16:39,779 --> 01:16:44,158
what could I do with them in my 60s yeah

2030
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,480
I was in it you know I mean I think part

2031
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,299
of life is

2032
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:51,119
I wish I had now what I had back when I

2033
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,400
was an idiot kid yeah and I think that

2034
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:56,099
keeps happening the older you get you're

2035
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:57,960
like man I wish you know because you

2036
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,579
just you gain experience if you're if

2037
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,980
you're good at what you do and you care

2038
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:03,840
you know is that a man thing like does

2039
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:07,339
anybody know any women that have that

2040
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,340
same drive or something like that

2041
01:17:08,899 --> 01:17:12,420
I don't know any women that are like

2042
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,239
that about their like oh I wish I had

2043
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:17,520
that old strain from back in 62 like I

2044
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:19,738
never would say that ever I and I I

2045
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,719
don't know maybe it's like a man's drive

2046
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:22,979
to I don't know there's a few but not

2047
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:24,779
very many

2048
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:27,000
yeah I would I don't think there's very

2049
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:30,559
many yeah

2050
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,560
I just think there's some Industries

2051
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,279
that are that are male dominated yeah

2052
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,020
that's true

2053
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,658
um and I think cannabis or some

2054
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:41,940
combination of it

2055
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:43,500
yeah actually yeah we're here in Canada

2056
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:45,359
there's quite a few women that are big

2057
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,539
players in the game yeah especially in

2058
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:51,679
the legal Recreation because well women

2059
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:53,880
are facing like they're better at doing

2060
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,158
and going through the legal system than

2061
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,420
we are and creative too like I know some

2062
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:58,679
really creative women in the

2063
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,060
recreational Market that are doing

2064
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:01,679
really well with their branding and

2065
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,560
stuff like that just because of it you

2066
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,899
know what I mean there's a huge gap up

2067
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,820
here between the old school guys that

2068
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:12,119
have been doing it forever and

2069
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:13,380
and businessmen and trust and throw the

2070
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:15,059
government into it's just miserable

2071
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:18,300
right yeah a few times some of my best

2072
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,980
Partners were that ran my websites

2073
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,060
um and they are we Geeks and can out

2074
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:23,879
smoking

2075
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,260
um so in South America I encountered

2076
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,840
that as well

2077
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:30,119
Argentina women are running the show

2078
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,380
down there um they're running they're I

2079
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:32,819
bet they're doing the seals they're

2080
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:36,000
running the shops

2081
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:36,960
uh it's it's more so than Canada in that

2082
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,060
way um

2083
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,579
I didn't really expect that because it's

2084
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:45,300
more of a machismo uh male dominated

2085
01:18:41,579 --> 01:18:48,359
culture but uh yeah down there uh

2086
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:50,039
yeah the women are they're hardcore

2087
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:52,198
that's awesome

2088
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:54,238
that's awesome you know a lot of the

2089
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:55,859
women Growers that I know that actually

2090
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:58,139
interact with the plant

2091
01:18:55,859 --> 01:18:59,939
tend to be much better Growers than men

2092
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,800
too for whatever reason they have that

2093
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:03,599
connection plan yeah you don't want to

2094
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,800
admit it but yeah that's true at the end

2095
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,239
of the day you're taking care of a

2096
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,400
living thing right

01:19:20,698 --> 01:19:24,359
Vancouver yeah the women would be in

there taking care of the plants and the

2105

dealing with the gangsters gambling yeah

2107
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:33,599
[Music]

2108
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:35,159
do you know much about that culture like

2109
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,780
that's not a culture that that's ever

2110
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:39,658
really been talked about like the the

2111
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:43,319
Asian culture uh the Asian black market

2112
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:47,759
culture in cannabis or in in Vancouver

2113
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:52,619
uh we have uh very very large Asian uh

2114
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:54,900
uh population there um yeah so uh like

2115
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:56,460
one city I lived in right next to

2116
01:19:54,899 --> 01:20:00,238
Vancouver called Richmond it's probably

2117
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:02,880
80 uh our Asian descent

2118
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:04,678
um wow and they they were they'd rent

2119
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:08,699
these big giant mansions and they would

2120
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:11,880
pump out the pounds that's awesome no

2121
01:20:08,698 --> 01:20:15,059
pots no nothing dirt on the yeah bird on

2122
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:16,800
the floor yeah white lights yeah you'd

2123
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,719
walk into these places there'd be mold

2124
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,659
halfway up the walls like wherever the

2125
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,158
poly started up was fine and down was

2126
01:20:21,658 --> 01:20:25,339
black mold

2127
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:27,719
and they just run these giant hot houses

2128
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:31,260
burn them and turn them and on to the

2129
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:33,539
next place like it was a while yeah when

2130
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:34,679
they when they got big in the the late

2131
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:37,380
90s

2132
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:41,420
it's their fault that uh that the rental

2133
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:43,739
uh societies uh told the police told

2134
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:47,179
landlords that you have to inspect your

2135
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:49,919
your rental house every two months

2136
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:51,960
and that's all because of the uh big

2137
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,539
Asian gangsters who would go in and

2138
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:56,340
destroy a house

2139
01:20:53,539 --> 01:20:58,140
three four crops and then they move on

2140
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:01,199
to the next house it kind of wrecked the

2141
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:02,159
uh rental uh uh scene uh in British

2142
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,759
Columbia

2143
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:09,238
wow I didn't even know that was a law

2144
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:11,100
that would yeah British Columbia only in

2145
01:21:09,238 --> 01:21:12,539
British Columbia because one out of

2146
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:16,440
three rental homes were a grow up

2147
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:17,819
commercial drop not not a small one it

2148
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:20,460
was a

2149
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:23,579
it's actually not I mean I think that's

2150
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,980
just the story to some degree like of

2151
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:28,140
how like a lot of times like like

2152
01:21:25,979 --> 01:21:30,559
immigrant populations work

2153
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:33,300
you know in the sense

2154
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,340
well yeah they not only that but they

2155
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:38,039
have like tighter family units the

2156
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:39,420
people are willing to live on less

2157
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:41,698
um you know they're willing to bond

2158
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:43,560
together to raise themselves up it

2159
01:21:41,698 --> 01:21:45,899
whatever they're doing is far better

2160
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:49,440
than where they came from to begin with

2161
01:21:45,899 --> 01:21:51,719
they stick together uh you know ratting

2162
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:53,759
on the group is Unthinkable because it's

2163
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,980
your entire family and everyone you know

2164
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,440
and all of your connections and all that

2165
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:59,459
and so it's actually a pretty effective

2166
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:02,279
method

2167
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:04,679
and it goes on in America too

2168
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:06,779
um in all kinds of different ways I used

2169
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:09,179
to I didn't know very much about it but

2170
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:11,340
I used to have some friends

2171
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:13,800
um in the Canadian scene you know 20

2172
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:16,199
something plus years ago and they were

2173
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,480
independent and they said the hardest

2174
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:20,158
thing to be independent was like you

2175
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:21,959
basically had to be invisible to the

2176
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:23,879
Asians and the bikers

2177
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,219
because those were the two those were

2178
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,199
the two big groups they kind of wanted

2179
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:29,819
to dominate everything and so he you

2180
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:32,879
know he was always like I always have to

2181
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:34,738
Bob and weave and not irritate either of

2182
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,600
either of those groups

2183
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:38,639
you know yeah

2184
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,739
um yeah and yeah

2185
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,960
and Vancouver and British Columbia back

2186
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:45,658
in the day was exactly the same yeah

2187
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,520
um Edmonton too everywhere across Canada

2188
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:51,119
it was the same uh you know if you got

2189
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:53,640
up to a certain size you kind of

2190
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:56,640
to not get taxed um you kind of had to

2191
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:58,199
know someone or yeah but I was lucky I

2192
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,600
was in the seed business

2193
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:02,579
um so they kind of seen us as a novelty

2194
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,199
they didn't take us too seriously we

2195
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:05,640
weren't competition to them so and I

2196
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:08,879
would some of the boys I would give

2197
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:11,100
clones to and uh they were off often buy

2198
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,179
their personal bag off of me and they

2199
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,340
wouldn't even smoke their own stuff

2200
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:16,560
because they fertilize it right up to

2201
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:18,779
the end and they they sell it to the

2202
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,039
states and call it beasters and but they

2203
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:22,319
wouldn't even smoke with their own stuff

2204
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:24,779
so the boys would come to me and buy

2205
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:27,179
their personal stash so I I was always

2206
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:30,359
kind of left alone to do whatever I

2207
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:31,859
wanted but uh but yeah it is once you

2208
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,539
get to a certain size you kind of have

2209
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:35,158
to have the the blessing

2210
01:23:33,539 --> 01:23:37,560
I wonder if they were trying to tax

2211
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:39,599
Emery at all

2212
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,620
no I mean it was pretty big and Flash I

2213
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,780
don't think so

2214
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:44,640
yeah he was too flashy I think they

2215
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:47,039
didn't want to be Associated and get

2216
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:49,020
busted that they kind of took the heat

2217
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:51,179
away from them he took the heat away and

2218
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:53,340
he was he was out there advertising BC

2219
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:55,859
Bud to the world he's a BC Vibe it's so

2220
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:57,779
great so he brought everybody to the

2221
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:59,819
market he brought people to British

2222
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:03,539
Columbia to buy their weed so they let

2223
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:05,698
Mark be he was a useful [Â __Â ] idiot is

2224
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,500
what he was a useless in the

2225
01:24:05,698 --> 01:24:09,059
neighborhood you'd come because that's

2226
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,859
where his store was and then you'd find

2227
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:13,320
the 10 other stores that were hidden

2228
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:15,000
around the market right yeah honestly if

2229
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:17,039
you're even in America too if you're in

2230
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,079
the Flop the flower market and the seed

2231
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,658
Market don't really intersect very much

2232
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:23,158
that's right that's true they just don't

2233
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:24,960
like and they don't affect each other

2234
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:27,420
all that much if you're pumping out

2235
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,000
specific clones for production

2236
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:31,859
you know like somebody with 30 different

2237
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,079
strains trying to make money in that way

2238
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:35,939
he's not affecting your clientele or

2239
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:38,279
what you're doing or your life at all

2240
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:40,379
it's just not even the same world yeah

2241
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:42,238
it's really not the same world yeah

2242
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,800
since I moved back to Canada about five

2243
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:47,039
six years ago

2244
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:48,659
um I I I make seeds um if I had a couple

2245
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:49,800
pounds of weed I wouldn't even know

2246
01:24:48,658 --> 01:24:51,179
where to sell it

2247
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,179
same

2248
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:55,859
it's bizarre um same like yeah when

2249
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:57,779
you're in the seats for that long like I

2250
01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:59,339
tell people this a lot too that that are

2251
01:24:57,779 --> 01:25:01,019
interested in getting into the seed game

2252
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:02,279
I always tell them if you're ever get

2253
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:04,260
gonna get serious about it you're gonna

2254
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:06,479
have to make that choice one day to

2255
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:08,039
permanently turn to seeds and when you

2256
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:09,899
do flour it's only going to be your

2257
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:11,279
testers but you're not going to be in

2258
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:12,719
flower production anymore you're going

2259
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:13,920
to lose those contacts eventually

2260
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,420
because you're just not going to need

2261
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,880
them you're going to devote your life to

2262
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:19,079
seed so you know yeah you're eventually

2263
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,219
going to have realizing one or the other

2264
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:23,399
yeah

2265
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:24,960
yeah exactly and I've always uh my

2266
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:26,819
buddies back in Vancouver back in the

2267
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,859
day they they look at me like I'm an

2268
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:31,380
idiot sometimes because I'd be growing

2269
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:33,719
these big rooms of uh Congolese and

2270
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:36,239
Mexican sativas that take 16 weeks to

2271
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:38,460
flower I like yeah like Jay you could

2272
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,579
have flipped two crops by now and made

2273
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:45,000
all this money and and you know maybe

2274
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:48,119
they were right but uh my

2275
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,760
I'm a weed geek though so I um so yeah

2276
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:52,380
it was all about selecting for me I was

2277
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,960
looking at the long game because I know

2278
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,619
even if I exit the industry I can come

2279
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,619
back as long as I have my genetics and

2280
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:03,599
stay true to my what they are and don't

2281
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:04,800
[Â __Â ] I can always re-enter the

2282
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,400
industry

2283
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,079
um

2284
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:08,519
but it's just going bud and just

2285
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:09,300
flipping pounds

2286
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,420
um

2287
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:14,340
you're you're a nobody and there is no

2288
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:15,179
brand you're just a guy with a bag of

2289
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,880
wheat

2290
01:26:15,179 --> 01:26:19,739
yeah so

2291
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,300
I think there's multiple ways to do that

2292
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:23,819
I mean where I live there's a bunch of

2293
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:25,199
people that sold flower to support their

2294
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:27,479
lifestyle

2295
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:29,460
and then did a bunch of breeding for

2296
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:31,678
themselves and their friends because

2297
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:33,600
that's what interested them

2298
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:35,399
you know so it's almost like they had a

2299
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,440
commercial side of it but then that

2300
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:40,198
funded their interests

2301
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:42,479
yeah you grow up one commercial room to

2302
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:44,279
pay the mortgage and pay the bills and

2303
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:45,899
then you play in the other room tough

2304
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:47,158
not to be interested that's for sure

2305
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:49,379
yeah

2306
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:51,119
yeah because for my experience has been

2307
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:54,119
and I don't know about you guys but like

2308
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:55,500
the older you get in the weed scene in

2309
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:58,559
order to stay

2310
01:26:55,500 --> 01:27:00,000
excited and like you know pumped to get

2311
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,159
into your room

2312
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,560
um I'm in my mid-40s or whatever most of

2313
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:06,658
my friends if you tell them I want you

2314
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,659
to Mono crop this

2315
01:27:06,658 --> 01:27:11,698
they could Pro they could do a good job

2316
01:27:08,658 --> 01:27:13,500
but they'd probably want to like just

2317
01:27:11,698 --> 01:27:16,319
shoot themselves after a while because

2318
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:19,139
they'd be so bored you know like

2319
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:21,840
literally like like you know my buddy

2320
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:23,520
you know you lose your passion yeah yeah

2321
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,500
you're like okay I grow these two

2322
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,500
strains I've dialed it in I figured out

2323
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:30,179
all the when to raise and lower the EC I

2324
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,939
figured out exactly how it likes to be

2325
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:35,520
grown and now I'm just making minor

2326
01:27:32,939 --> 01:27:37,559
adjustments and steering the ship and I

2327
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,540
feel like I'm a factory worker yeah

2328
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,800
we're like seeds and all this other

2329
01:27:39,539 --> 01:27:43,679
stuff

2330
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,139
it brings Joy yeah exactly but we need

2331
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:49,380
those people uh to produce uh weed for

2332
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:52,079
the for the public but uh that's not me

2333
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:53,699
um yeah definitely I have to grow I'm

2334
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:55,260
growing out seedlings it's like

2335
01:27:53,698 --> 01:27:57,539
Christmas time when you when you start a

2336
01:27:55,260 --> 01:28:00,480
new batch of seeds to see what's going

2337
01:27:57,539 --> 01:28:01,859
to come up uh I'm like a little kid at

2338
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:02,879
Christmas wondering what's under the

2339
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,099
tree

2340
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,679
um yeah for sure you can dial it in yeah

2341
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:09,900
like yeah he's more of a pick a few

2342
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,300
strains and dial it in so we all need

2343
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:14,460
each other in the industry but uh

2344
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:17,340
but that's not my game

2345
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:19,920
I mean what what I find hard about like

2346
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:22,500
being a breeder or seed popping or

2347
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:25,079
anything like that is that it's pretty

2348
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:28,979
small about a size seed pop you can do

2349
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:31,619
where you can honestly judge like what

2350
01:28:28,979 --> 01:28:33,359
just happened because if you do a big

2351
01:28:31,619 --> 01:28:34,979
seed pop and you want to save it and you

2352
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:36,658
want to have backups and then you want

2353
01:28:34,979 --> 01:28:39,959
to get all your friends that you trust

2354
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:42,479
to help you smoke and test it like you

2355
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:44,460
can do a big seed run but eventually how

2356
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:45,419
are you going to judge those hundreds of

2357
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:48,000
plants

2358
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:50,579
yes right and you can and the problem is

2359
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,319
for me is that all the stuff that you

2360
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:54,119
can visually see like you can be like oh

2361
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:56,698
that one has the structure I like that

2362
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:59,039
one has the the leaf ratio this one has

2363
01:28:56,698 --> 01:29:01,379
the resin but the part that really will

2364
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:02,698
make a strain lasting or not to me is

2365
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:04,380
invisible

2366
01:29:02,698 --> 01:29:06,658
like you don't know how it's going to

2367
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,760
affect you or taste until you try it

2368
01:29:06,658 --> 01:29:10,259
yeah you can't look at the you can't

2369
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,179
look at it behind you and be like oh

2370
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:14,699
that's going to be the one

2371
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:17,100
yeah in fact also like what I like to do

2372
01:29:14,698 --> 01:29:20,099
as well is uh after I've did my

2373
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:22,380
selections out of a female hunt

2374
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:25,020
um you have to grow the clone of the

2375
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:27,900
variety too not just the seedling after

2376
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:29,340
you oh yeah you see the structures and

2377
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:31,379
different characteristics and you gotta

2378
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:33,440
yeah put it through some scratch you

2379
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:36,000
only get it to see that one way one time

2380
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:38,638
I and I talked about that a whole bunch

2381
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,579
where I got to a point where I never

2382
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:44,639
flowered like when I was testing seeds

2383
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:48,960
inside I never floured the seed plant

2384
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:50,940
yeah clones and root all the clones and

2385
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,739
flower the Clone because I would see the

2386
01:29:50,939 --> 01:29:54,719
seed plant once and it would never be

2387
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:56,819
that way again and I was always

2388
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,300
interested well what is the Clone gonna

2389
01:29:56,819 --> 01:29:59,299
do yeah

2390
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:05,519
you know you don't have that you don't

2391
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:07,739
have that Tap Root you don't have that

2392
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,380
seed plant Vigor you don't have the same

2393
01:30:07,738 --> 01:30:12,479
stretchiness it's just different

2394
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:14,940
well even now even though I'm switching

2395
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:16,799
most of my rooms over to LEDs uh when I

2396
01:30:14,939 --> 01:30:19,678
do my seed selection because I've been

2397
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:22,500
growing under uh HBS for for decades

2398
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:25,560
when I do my selecting in my tester room

2399
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:27,539
I do it under the HPS and I yeah trim

2400
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,699
nothing off the bottom I leave all those

2401
01:30:27,539 --> 01:30:31,619
Shaggy bits at the bottom to see how and

2402
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:33,719
I don't pinch it just to see how it

2403
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:36,479
grows naturally sure and that's what

2404
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:38,039
I've been doing for for 25 years uh so I

2405
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:41,158
want to see what it does all on its own

2406
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:43,679
without any manipulation and then I make

2407
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:45,599
my selections

2408
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:48,719
the way I've been doing it for that's

2409
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,460
that's my way of doing it because

2410
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:52,800
and then after that with the Clone then

2411
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:55,679
I start playing see if it ties down good

2412
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,000
how it reacts when you're pinch it I

2413
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,859
mean because sometimes unless you see

2414
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,719
what it does

2415
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:04,079
you won't know what kind of manipulation

2416
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:06,060
to apply to get what you want out of it

2417
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:07,679
you know if something if you don't pinch

2418
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:10,020
it and something makes some incredible

2419
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:12,000
two and a half foot long Cola

2420
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:14,460
you might not want to pinch it and go

2421
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,960
for all those side buds yeah yeah you

2422
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:18,119
might wanna you might want to leave it

2423
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,399
that way you know sometimes you might

2424
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:22,920
grow something and all those bottom nugs

2425
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:25,079
end up nice and solid

2426
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,359
you know sometimes they end up all leafy

2427
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:29,279
in a mess and so if it's leafy in a mess

2428
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:32,039
you're like oh I have to strip all that

2429
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:34,500
off to concentrate it up top

2430
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:36,600
but sometimes it'll make nice nug all

2431
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:38,158
the way down to the base without any

2432
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,900
effort

2433
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:41,899
and you know sometimes you have to watch

2434
01:31:42,779 --> 01:31:48,238
exactly yeah

2435
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:49,679
I remember we have it the first big I've

2436
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:51,599
seen that I was impressed with was

2437
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,500
actually breeder Steve's uh shishka

2438
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,800
Berry

2439
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:58,920
yeah oh my God like it was like three

2440
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:01,800
feet tall just one big giant Cola and

2441
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:05,219
just stuff you hardly seen any uh red

2442
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:07,560
hairs on it it was just big green and

2443
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:11,480
crystally uh with almost no red hairs

2444
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,480
and what did it smell like

2445
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,520
um I always wondered with shis could

2446
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:19,139
Berry because I've never had like just

2447
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:21,239
cuts up there

2448
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:22,159
a little bit on the fruity side I would

2449
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:25,979
say

2450
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:28,138
it was there was almost too much resin

2451
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:31,039
that it cut out all the terpenes there

2452
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:31,039
wasn't no it wasn't okay

2453
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:37,139
you [Â __Â ] up and it was huge and my

2454
01:32:34,439 --> 01:32:39,539
lime green huge lime green buds I gotta

2455
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:44,100
I gotta have Steve that one man he he

2456
01:32:39,539 --> 01:32:47,639
nailed that one that's why and it was a

2457
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:50,039
yeah it was a it was a quality name

2458
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:51,539
yeah yeah I mean people we can talk

2459
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:53,219
about

2460
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:55,979
some you know sometimes what's funny

2461
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:58,219
about it is like a cool name goes a long

2462
01:32:55,979 --> 01:32:58,218
way

2463
01:32:59,238 --> 01:33:04,138
for sure and even even shishka Berry

2464
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:06,119
like it's got a cool nickname you can

2465
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:08,760
just call it the Shish you know like

2466
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:10,859
things that like that matters

2467
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,780
you know yeah there's so many strains

2468
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:14,639
that I know that are just just kick ass

2469
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:17,460
but they have a shitty name and nobody

2470
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:20,880
buys them yeah

2471
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:24,000
it's sad but you know what what's that

2472
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,219
if you could think of one strain uh each

2473
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,380
one of you one strain that you think

2474
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:30,359
should get more recognition than it

2475
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:32,699
currently does what what what's this

2476
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:35,039
first strain that comes to your minds

2477
01:33:32,698 --> 01:33:36,779
so from Vancouver Island Seed Company

2478
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:37,979
Jiffy pot huh

2479
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:41,340
okay

2480
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:43,319
um and from my own stuff probably my

2481
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:44,639
first Contact

2482
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:48,238
um the first Contact

2483
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:51,000
yeah because it it's high CBD and super

2484
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:52,319
chirpy but I I don't really sell I got a

2485
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,899
big bag of it but I don't really sell

2486
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,639
many seeds and it's and people don't

2487
01:33:54,899 --> 01:34:00,000
know what they're missing on that one um

2488
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,619
yeah it's just super super chirpy you

2489
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,779
can just rub your hand up against the

2490
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:07,439
leaves and you know you're sticking to

2491
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:10,439
it um and it's a nice Buzz um

2492
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:12,839
really nice Buzz it's not super Stony

2493
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:14,939
but it's one of those

2494
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:17,100
quality when my son's when my son

2495
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:19,559
started smoking weed I that's the strain

2496
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:22,739
I gave him because I wanted to hire CBD

2497
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:24,239
and lower THC because yeah yeah I'm

2498
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:25,919
still 18 years old you got to get your

2499
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:26,638
head together a little bit and get to

2500
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,319
work

2501
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,619
um so I told hey if you want to smoke

2502
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:34,399
weed do my first Contact so uh but no

2503
01:34:31,619 --> 01:34:37,500
it's one of my one of my best strains

2504
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:39,119
that I people don't buy a lot of and and

2505
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,560
they should because it's it's one of my

2506
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:42,960
best ones

2507
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:45,960
um but yeah other than that strain of

2508
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:50,239
mine and Jiffy pot from uh

2509
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:50,239
from Vancouver Island Seed Company

2510
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:53,519
those are they had a two up right off

2511
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:56,460
the top of my head those are the two I

2512
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:59,340
can think of what do you got Casey

2513
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:01,500
I'm all about the death Baba I think uh

2514
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:04,319
we up here we got it's the pre-98 death

2515
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:08,219
bubba cut it's called and it's just like

2516
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:11,158
the obnoxious Kush gas candy like it's

2517
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:13,560
just amazing in the the like the medical

2518
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:15,119
benefits that come along with I don't

2519
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:18,000
know if it's the mixture of terpenes or

2520
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:20,760
what but uh it's phenomenal like even

2521
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,800
for myself for nausea like it's just

2522
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:24,840
been like it's one of those strains that

2523
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,820
I could never if I had to pick one for

2524
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:29,039
the rest of my life that would be it

2525
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:31,439
you know what's in it

2526
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:33,658
uh uh if you give me a couple minutes

2527
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,819
I'll figure it out because I've got test

2528
01:35:33,658 --> 01:35:37,799
results here I just gotta dig them up I

2529
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:39,960
want to um I want to say a long time ago

2530
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,079
somebody gave me seeds of it it was like

2531
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,399
a black domino Bubba maybe but I I think

2532
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:45,899
that there's been a few over the years

2533
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:47,579
that have had that name so I always

2534
01:35:45,899 --> 01:35:50,638
wonder like when people talk about the

2535
01:35:47,579 --> 01:35:52,260
death we just call it the pre-98 cut

2536
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,840
it's been a cut that's been around for

2537
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:57,780
years and years and years similar spell

2538
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:00,679
to the OG kush yeah it's like super

2539
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:03,719
super gassy soup I wonder if it's just

2540
01:36:00,679 --> 01:36:06,359
Kush what if it's just our Bubba down

2541
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:08,880
here the p98 Bubba

2542
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:12,000
or if it's a hybrid of the 398 Bubba

2543
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:15,420
yeah I have no idea I uh I have the OG

2544
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,760
Kush and I'm not a big fish guy but uh

2545
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:19,440
everybody has it I stick with my own

2546
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,900
strains but uh

2547
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,819
I like the high Emoji Kush I like the

2548
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:26,819
the high of older Jeep coaches to me is

2549
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:28,679
what always it like it no matter what

2550
01:36:26,819 --> 01:36:30,599
any cup I've ever gone to where it's

2551
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:32,760
like a real legit cup if someone brings

2552
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:35,280
a really good cut of OG Kush it's very

2553
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:36,960
hard for anybody to not pick that one as

2554
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:39,119
the winner like it just seems to always

2555
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,679
be the winner in the room uh for the

2556
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:43,198
high

2557
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:45,359
but there's a few similarities as well

2558
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:46,859
with the cheese I know people have

2559
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:50,519
noticed that the cheese is a little more

2560
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:52,859
uh rank smelling but uh there is some

2561
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:55,380
similarities uh when it's over dried you

2562
01:36:52,859 --> 01:36:56,579
can really see the uh uh similarities

2563
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:59,639
with the cheese

2564
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:04,439
um so in this death Bubba it's dominant

2565
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:07,159
as beta caraphylene and then fenchal

2566
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:10,519
uh Alpha Himalayan

2567
01:37:07,158 --> 01:37:12,658
isobarom meal

2568
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:16,320
uh lemonade

2569
01:37:12,658 --> 01:37:18,359
beta nursing pinene Alpha and beta

2570
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,698
pinene

2571
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:22,500
complex I think that just I think that

2572
01:37:20,698 --> 01:37:24,960
just means it gets you [Â __Â ] up yeah

2573
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:26,399
yeah it's very complex is what it is

2574
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,520
yeah

2575
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:30,319
yeah like I've uh oh salmon fishing on

2576
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:34,139
the ocean

2577
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:36,479

2580
01:37:38,698 --> 01:37:44,039
the hospital they knock you out for it

2581
01:37:40,619 --> 01:37:46,679
yeah and uh woke up dry heaving puking

2582
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:49,019
tried the gravel no no good

2583
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:50,399

2584
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:52,380
right out like

2585
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:54,119
pain management and stuff like that like

2586
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:55,920
on the medical side of things like I

2587
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:57,840
think it should it should be everywhere

2588
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,760
there's a company finally I think

2589
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,020
bringing it out in Canada here pistol in

2590
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,159
Paris

2591
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:04,920
um they're going to be launching it into

2592
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:06,179
the legal recreational market and like I

2593
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,219
think it should be in the medical side

2594
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:12,000
of things for sure like if they should

2595
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:13,619
do studies on it right yeah I'm going to

2596
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,380
be Crossing it with my Romulan here on

2597
01:38:13,619 --> 01:38:18,420
the next round as well so uh give it a

2598
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:21,600
try he keeps raving about it for a few

2599
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:23,060
years and I've smoked it it kicks my ass

2600
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,440
yeah

2601
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:26,880
I'm gonna I'm gonna have to try it like

2602
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:29,519
for nausea stuff that sounds awesome

2603
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:32,279
that sounds killer yeah oh yeah if you

2604
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,080
can find it it's uh it's something else

2605
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:35,719
yeah

2606
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:38,519
not so what about you

2607
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:40,380
yeah I'll take them

2608
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:43,920
what's a strain that you think has a

2609
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:46,800
like has a crappy name maybe or whatever

2610
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:48,060
and doesn't sell as or get the shine

2611
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,000
that it should

2612
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:54,300
uh I mean there's a bunch of them but uh

2613
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,479
I'll get like the uh dog [Â __Â ]

2614
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:58,920
yeah yeah you know there's there's this

2615
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:00,599
strain it used to be called in

2616
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:03,300
Minneapolis it had a way cooler name it

2617
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,159
was called Electric Boogaloo and it's a

2618
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:07,380
little mysterious what it is but I think

2619
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:09,599
it it might be like silver Pearl by

2620
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:12,539
Hayes or it might it's it's some kind of

2621
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,340
hazy hybrid from the early 90s yeah and

2622
01:39:12,539 --> 01:39:15,960
it's one of those ones where like you

2623
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:17,520
know Matt and I you know we have some

2624
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:19,679
get-togethers with a bunch of friends

2625
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,840
you know and people gather from all over

2626
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:23,579
and breeders come and stuff and it

2627
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,039
always ends up being one of those ones

2628
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:28,619
that like everybody isn't it's in their

2629
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:30,238
top two or three that they tried and

2630
01:39:28,619 --> 01:39:32,819
they always can't figure out why it's

2631
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:35,459
not more popular yeah it's definitely

2632
01:39:32,819 --> 01:39:36,359
one of those ones that I I you know I

2633
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:38,158
was talking about it the other night

2634
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:39,658
with someone I was like I think when it

2635
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:42,179
comes to Elites they're like everybody

2636
01:39:39,658 --> 01:39:43,920
seems to love Bubba everybody seems to

2637
01:39:42,179 --> 01:39:44,819
universally for the most part like OG

2638
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,158
Kush

2639
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:48,719
and Everyone likes Electric Boogaloo and

2640
01:39:47,158 --> 01:39:50,279
I can't think of anything else that like

2641
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:52,139
some people like blueberry some people

2642
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:54,719
don't some people you know that like

2643
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:56,940
those three I could think of I I mean I

2644
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:59,340
I tend to think too that we're in such a

2645
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:00,960
commercial industry in a way that people

2646
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:02,159
only want to grow what's currently

2647
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,439
popular

2648
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:07,379
yeah and so when you get old like we are

2649
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:09,178
now or older there's been all these

2650
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:11,159
great strains that have gone through

2651
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:13,199
your hands that deserve their moment in

2652
01:40:11,158 --> 01:40:14,759
the Sun but they just don't get enough

2653
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:16,799
play because they're not currently

2654
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:19,079
popular they're not being cropped for

2655
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,840
production people aren't getting to try

2656
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:23,100
them that much and so as a result of

2657
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,560
that it has nothing to do with the

2658
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,420
quality of the plant itself it basically

2659
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:31,340
has to do with this weird hype and

2660
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:31,340
people's access or not to it

2661
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:37,559
right now and that's and that and then

2662
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,619
it ends up just getting saved by heads

2663
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,179
and passed around and grown for personal

2664
01:40:39,619 --> 01:40:44,880
and passed around to friends and stuff

2665
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:47,760
like that and everybody can't believe

2666
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,739
um what uh you know and names are a huge

2667
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,659
thing I'll tell a story

2668
01:40:49,738 --> 01:40:53,279
um there was this strain in Mendo that

2669
01:40:51,658 --> 01:40:55,259
was made by a friend and it was called

2670
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:58,319
it was made by everybody shot it was

2671
01:40:55,260 --> 01:41:00,239
called Big Wreck it was Big Bud by train

2672
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:02,039
wreck okay

2673
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:04,379
and it was Frosty and it was beautiful

2674
01:41:02,039 --> 01:41:06,899
and it finished at the end of September

2675
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:09,300
it was really pretty but nobody wanted

2676
01:41:06,899 --> 01:41:11,879
big wreck nobody was interested in Big

2677
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:14,279
Bud train wreck right yeah and so one of

2678
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:16,139
my friends changed the name to Barry

2679
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:18,899
White

2680
01:41:16,139 --> 01:41:21,300
and as soon as the name changed to Barry

2681
01:41:18,899 --> 01:41:25,279
White not only could they move endless

2682
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:25,279
packs of it but they got a premium

2683
01:41:25,698 --> 01:41:29,698
you know they got a couple hundred bucks

2684
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:32,279
more than they should for other things

2685
01:41:29,698 --> 01:41:36,238
and it was all about the name change

2686
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:38,399
nobody wanted big wreck but Barry White

2687
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:40,559
I want some of that that happened with

2688
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:41,879
that that happened with us as well a few

2689
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,679
years ago when I started working with

2690
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:46,079
the OG Kush

2691
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:48,840
um uh we just had it named as a cross

2692
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:51,000
and never sold and then we our OG Kush

2693
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:54,360
crossed with the Romulan of wearing

2694
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,579
renamed it Ogopogo uh and he started

2695
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:58,259
flying off the shelves

2696
01:41:56,579 --> 01:42:01,800
I don't know if you know what Olga Pogo

2697
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:02,940
is yeah yeah it's out like our uh senior

2698
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,600
Loch Ness Monster

2699
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:08,939
yeah yeah exactly and but great stranger

2700
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:12,300
names

2701
01:42:08,939 --> 01:42:14,819
make a big difference you know I I tend

2702
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:17,159
to think jesel is is one that I've

2703
01:42:14,819 --> 01:42:19,079
noticed that like it's it's one of the

2704
01:42:17,158 --> 01:42:20,819
original canvas but for some reason it's

2705
01:42:19,079 --> 01:42:22,800
no one's ever hunted it and everybody

2706
01:42:20,819 --> 01:42:24,779
that had it dropped it for whatever

2707
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,940
reason because the name just never

2708
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:28,679
caught on it was a dumb name

2709
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:30,539
I mean it's it's and that's what I was

2710
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:32,579
saying before too about how like a lot

2711
01:42:30,539 --> 01:42:34,618
of weed access is kind of flash in the

2712
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:36,840
pan where it's like if you weren't there

2713
01:42:34,618 --> 01:42:39,960
for those few years you might had on how

2714
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:42,779
to have access to it at all and so most

2715
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:45,719
of the currently popular strains aren't

2716
01:42:42,779 --> 01:42:47,579
nearly as good as the collection of old

2717
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:50,158
school classics that some people have

2718
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:51,840
access to there's just not a proper way

2719
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:54,899
to Market them and get them out there

2720
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:57,360
and people often want to do what's easy

2721
01:42:54,899 --> 01:42:59,279
yeah you know and they want to do with

2722
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:01,559
the Brokers and the buyers and the

2723
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:04,380
market is asking for and so whatever

2724
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,340
that shift is they'll just go with that

2725
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:07,560
flow

2726
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:09,779
and you know you can end up having

2727
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:12,420
people hundreds of people hundreds of

2728
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:14,099
Growers having some popular cut and then

2729
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:16,618
the market shifts and 10 years later

2730
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:18,840
four Dudes held onto it

2731
01:43:16,618 --> 01:43:20,339
yeah yeah and that's like the most

2732
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,039
common thing

2733
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:26,219
well thanks I'm thankful for those four

2734
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:28,560
Dudes yeah is that right I've gotten a

2735
01:43:26,219 --> 01:43:31,500
lot of strains back uh from uh some old

2736
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,780
friends uh that I thought stories that I

2737
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:35,698
thought were gone years ago and

2738
01:43:33,779 --> 01:43:38,880
people come out of the closet and say

2739
01:43:35,698 --> 01:43:41,039
hey I still got a cut yeah what what's

2740
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,279
really important actually is is people

2741
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:46,198
in like I don't know about Canada

2742
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:48,539
specifically but like in America people

2743
01:43:46,198 --> 01:43:51,599
that like you know live in areas that

2744
01:43:48,539 --> 01:43:53,158
like don't change all that much right so

2745
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,780
they can they can grow their two or

2746
01:43:53,158 --> 01:43:56,219
three little strains and they can sell

2747
01:43:54,779 --> 01:43:58,139
them to their friends and their friends

2748
01:43:56,219 --> 01:44:00,719
are just stoked on getting really high

2749
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:01,500
quality weed and the fads don't affect

2750
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,020
them

2751
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:06,840
yeah that's a lot of times who you find

2752
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:09,000
Oh I thought this thing was lost and

2753
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,980
they're like no I have it you know I

2754
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,020
never was forced to change

2755
01:44:10,979 --> 01:44:15,419
and we still love it

2756
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:16,139
that's how I got my uh Hawaiian sativa

2757
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:20,279
back

2758
01:44:16,139 --> 01:44:22,980
yeah a good old boy from rural Manitoba

2759
01:44:20,279 --> 01:44:26,579
said hey I still have it I bought it in

2760
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:28,319
1999 and he has beautiful cut and uh

2761
01:44:26,579 --> 01:44:30,779
thank God for him

2762
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:34,198
yeah that's a great line

2763
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:36,300
classic classic coins TV line one of our

2764
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:38,879
buddies is I I just gave all my seeds of

2765
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:40,560
it to uh my buddy brains and he just did

2766
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,618
a big pop of it so he could be running a

2767
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,420
bunch of those and reproducing those too

2768
01:44:43,618 --> 01:44:48,118
just to see if we can find in them but

2769
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:49,980
that's my favorite I mean I never had a

2770
01:44:48,118 --> 01:44:52,738
traditional Hawaiian line because it's

2771
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:55,138
before my era but out of all the lines

2772
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:57,238
I've ever had called Hawaiian that was

2773
01:44:55,139 --> 01:45:00,000
the one I thought was the nicest it was

2774
01:44:57,238 --> 01:45:02,099
a nice like sativa sweet just had a

2775
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
really nice quality High though really

2776
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:05,039
nice

2777
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,560
yeah anything that I usually see now

2778
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:10,139
that's called Hawaiian is not like it

2779
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:12,239
was back in the day oh yeah a lot of the

2780
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:14,480
Hawaiian from the 90s I remember a real

2781
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:18,479
what they call a menthol

2782
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:20,879
Menthol flavor uh sativas uh and that's

2783
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:23,939
how I remember the Hawaiian interesting

2784
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,520
but nowadays no not you don't get that

2785
01:45:23,939 --> 01:45:29,460
Menthol flavor very much anymore it was

2786
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:31,739
intense intensely uh menthol

2787
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:33,960
and that was during the 90s from Hawaii

2788
01:45:31,738 --> 01:45:37,379
up there in in Canada

2789
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:39,658
yeah yeah I got with Federation Seed

2790
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:42,118
Company we got those those uh genetics

2791
01:45:39,658 --> 01:45:44,519
from uh from Vancouver Island Seed

2792
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:45,238
Company from from G-Man there

2793
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:47,100
um

2794
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:49,319
yeah he had a few different versions of

2795
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:51,300
it a few different crosses it was

2796
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:52,618
amazing it's uh but he got it straight

2797
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:54,360
from Hawaii

2798
01:45:52,618 --> 01:45:55,920
I know we've touched on him briefly

2799
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:58,079
before but

2800
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:00,960
it seems like he had like a major major

2801
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:02,819
influence on your career at least and a

2802
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,739
few others around you and the strains in

2803
01:46:02,819 --> 01:46:06,359
in Canada in general not just in

2804
01:46:04,738 --> 01:46:08,519
Vancouver Island

2805
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:10,319
yeah he was a big influence for me uh

2806
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:12,900
and a few other breeders on the island

2807
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:14,698
and a lot of the source genetics came

2808
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:19,138
from him he was he was growing since the

2809
01:46:14,698 --> 01:46:22,198
mid 70s and uh you know I I was a

2810
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:24,239
Youngster on the scene coming in mid 90s

2811
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:25,379
so

2812
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:27,238
yeah

2813
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:29,100
I'd love to talk to him about when he

2814
01:46:27,238 --> 01:46:30,539
saw the first indicas and stuff like

2815
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:32,280
that since he was around during that

2816
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:33,899
time and what his experience was with

2817
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:35,939
them has he ever told you about anything

2818
01:46:33,899 --> 01:46:38,879
like that

2819
01:46:35,939 --> 01:46:42,419
um oh yeah yeah we we were we grew side

2820
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,579
by side for years uh back in the day but

2821
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:46,920
uh he's kind of dropped off the planet

2822
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:48,658
here and I actually mentioned or I

2823
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:53,000
messaged him about two or three months

2824
01:46:48,658 --> 01:46:53,000
ago and yeah he hasn't gotten back to me

2825
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:57,300
so yeah hopefully he'll turn up because

2826
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,000
he sounds like an interesting guy to

2827
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:01,560
interview me yeah but you probably won't

2828
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,500
ever see his face

2829
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:06,300
oh that's funny old old school old old

2830
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,520
school yeah

2831
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:11,400
yeah

2832
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:13,440
all right it's hard it's hard for some

2833
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:14,579
people to turn off that Decades of

2834
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:16,799
programming

2835
01:47:14,579 --> 01:47:19,260
that's true I don't want you to see my

2836
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,300
face I don't want you to see my name I

2837
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:22,619
don't want you to have any association I

2838
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,420
mean we even have friends of ours

2839
01:47:22,618 --> 01:47:26,219
that'll come on the show and you know

2840
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:28,859
they want to wear a mask or they want to

2841
01:47:26,219 --> 01:47:30,658
be in a dark room or you know they live

2842
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:33,359
in a state that's not that permissive

2843
01:47:30,658 --> 01:47:36,000
yet and they worry about it getting out

2844
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:37,759
you know or even friends or family or

2845
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,079
you know in some cases

2846
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:42,179
you know something like that knowing

2847
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:43,738
yeah so everyone has a different

2848
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:47,880
perspective on like what their own

2849
01:47:43,738 --> 01:47:51,299
safety is or perception of it

2850
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:55,618
a different era yeah for me even like

2851
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:58,079
for been selling since mid 90s and like

2852
01:47:55,618 --> 01:48:00,059
didn't tell anybody anything like if you

2853
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:03,000
didn't buy off me you didn't know

2854
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:05,520
and uh now to see all the brands that

2855
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,340
are popping up just because they didn't

2856
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:11,280
care or they would advertise or whatever

2857
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:13,739
now they've got established Brands years

2858
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:16,559
later words myself like I didn't say

2859
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:18,718
[Â __Â ] with a mouthful to anybody and we

2860
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,699
started starting from scratch right a

2861
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:23,279
whole lot more knowledge but on the

2862
01:48:20,698 --> 01:48:25,678
ground sure that's right

2863
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:26,639
I mean when I when I was young in

2864
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,380
Chicago

2865
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,118
like there was only two or three people

2866
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:33,840
that knew I grew

2867
01:48:30,118 --> 01:48:36,359
and sometimes I would be at a party and

2868
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:38,520
Alpha one of those people I would buy a

2869
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:41,579
full price eighth or quarter

2870
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:45,139
yeah so that way when friends saw me

2871
01:48:41,579 --> 01:48:47,340
with the weed they knew where I got it

2872
01:48:45,139 --> 01:48:49,440
yeah they wouldn't they wouldn't think

2873
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:51,659
that I I why you know he can't be the

2874
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:55,698
grower I saw him buy it off a homie for

2875
01:48:51,658 --> 01:48:55,698
a hundred bucks a quarter yes yes

2876
01:48:56,658 --> 01:49:01,019
you know it's it's one of those things

2877
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:03,179
where it was like I mean we used to I

2878
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:04,980
used to I had a good friend of mine I

2879
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:06,000
would pay him to drive me to the Growth

2880
01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:08,939
Store

2881
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,560
because he was straight as can be and if

2882
01:49:08,939 --> 01:49:12,479
they ran his license plate and they

2883
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,340
raided them he literally had nothing

2884
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:16,198
that was going to get him in trouble

2885
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:19,079
yeah that doesn't get him on anything

2886
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:20,399
you know and so we wouldn't even go we

2887
01:49:19,079 --> 01:49:23,460
wouldn't even go to the Growth Store

2888
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:27,238
with a car that was tied to any of the

2889
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:29,658
sites yeah you know yeah you parked 23

2890
01:49:27,238 --> 01:49:32,879
blocks away yeah I didn't understand

2891
01:49:29,658 --> 01:49:34,559
computers and so when overgrow and

2892
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,159
cannabis world and some of those first

2893
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:39,600
forums came out I was terrified to post

2894
01:49:37,158 --> 01:49:41,399
yeah because I didn't know if a

2895
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:43,679
government agent could just like call me

2896
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:45,299
up and figure out like exactly where I

2897
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:48,239
was posting from and where the computer

2898
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:50,159
was and I had so many good jokes I could

2899
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:53,519
pull right now and I'm just not going to

2900
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:55,679
even my medical licenses even medical

2901
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,940
license is Canada like I thought that

2902
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:58,859
was a joke like they were just like

2903
01:49:56,939 --> 01:50:01,738
people were signing up to get raided

2904
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:03,179
right yeah yeah for sure when they could

2905
01:50:01,738 --> 01:50:05,819
have went out and got a license and been

2906
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:08,239
legal I just shut up and kept doing what

2907
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:08,238
I was doing

2908
01:50:08,658 --> 01:50:12,658
I did not want to be on that I I thought

2909
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:13,859
everybody was just eventually going to

2910
01:50:12,658 --> 01:50:14,960
get pulled I thought it was the biggest

2911
01:50:13,859 --> 01:50:17,339
yeah

2912
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:20,480
you guys are ridiculous like you don't

2913
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:23,100
see what's going on here yeah

2914
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:25,019
but you know it

2915
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:27,000
that's interesting too because when I

2916
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:29,280
first ended up in Mendo I actually ended

2917
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:32,158
up on a legal medical program because my

2918
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:33,719
ex had cancer right and it was through

2919
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:36,059
the Sheriff's department and it was

2920
01:50:33,719 --> 01:50:37,679
through the the Health Service of uh of

2921
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:40,980
our County and all that

2922
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:43,380
and literally like the sheriff was so

2923
01:50:40,979 --> 01:50:44,819
cool back then he burnt like the feds

2924
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:46,440
threatened to come in and take all of

2925
01:50:44,819 --> 01:50:47,880
his records because they wanted to know

2926
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:50,279
who was who

2927
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:51,779
and he burned them all yeah that's

2928
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:53,399
pretty cool he literally he shut the

2929
01:50:51,779 --> 01:50:54,658
program down and he burned all the files

2930
01:50:53,399 --> 01:50:56,359
because he was like you're not going to

2931
01:50:54,658 --> 01:50:58,618
come in and rate a bunch of sick people

2932
01:50:56,359 --> 01:51:01,439
nope I don't know who it is you don't

2933
01:50:58,618 --> 01:51:03,839
know who it is oops Yeah right yeah and

2934
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:06,178
so sometimes there were cool people yeah

2935
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,699
a cool cop that's never heard of that

2936
01:51:06,179 --> 01:51:12,300
before that's crazy

2937
01:51:08,698 --> 01:51:15,960
I mean for a Time

2938
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:17,579
they exist in theory yeah they do exist

2939
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:19,439
I mean they're humans like anybody else

2940
01:51:17,579 --> 01:51:20,760
they might be a preponderance to one

2941
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:22,019
side or another

2942
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:23,760
but I mean weren't you mentioning

2943
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:25,920
earlier on the show that like you know

2944
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,539
you were in Spain you were selling

2945
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:31,679
clones to Cops

2946
01:51:27,539 --> 01:51:34,560
the cops yeah I never feared the cops

2947
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:36,060
when I lived in Spain um in Canada it's

2948
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,860
a whole different story when you run

2949
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:40,080
into a cop you kind of

2950
01:51:37,859 --> 01:51:41,880
look all straight and proper and pretend

2951
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,639
nothing's going on but still see until

2952
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:46,679
proven innocence and in Spain yeah no

2953
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:49,260
fear of the cops you could be you can

2954
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:53,100
walk up to smoke and enjoy and uh report

2955
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:54,780
you know something legit I just didn't

2956
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:57,539
fear cops there

2957
01:51:54,779 --> 01:52:00,238
um that would be nice it's a whole

2958
01:51:57,539 --> 01:52:01,380
different in their ears yeah that's a

2959
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:03,118
different culture that's that's the

2960
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:05,460
thing yeah as an American I often forget

2961
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:07,380
like and not even just an American like

2962
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:11,158
where I'm from specifically is very

2963
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:12,779
top-heavy and and conservative so if he

2964
01:52:11,158 --> 01:52:15,539
lives in the worst place in California

2965
01:52:12,779 --> 01:52:16,979
the worst like the worst we have TV

2966
01:52:15,539 --> 01:52:20,279
shows about our police force being

2967
01:52:16,979 --> 01:52:22,259
jackasses you know yeah it's not good so

2968
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:24,719
like my perspective is a little skewed

2969
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:26,520
on police that I I never really have any

2970
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:29,520
positive outlook but I forget like yeah

2971
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:32,060
other places they are your peers like

2972
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:34,739
it's not that same adversarial thing

2973
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:37,080
yeah when I was growing up on on the

2974
01:52:34,738 --> 01:52:40,379
Prairies here in Canada my uh parents

2975
01:52:37,079 --> 01:52:42,179
they worked uh for the police they like

2976
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:44,699
janitors and they did some guarding at

2977
01:52:42,179 --> 01:52:46,319
the prison and my dad told me after

2978
01:52:44,698 --> 01:52:49,138
years of working with him he said one

2979
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:50,399
out of five he's a good guy he's there

2980
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:52,560
for the right reason

2981
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:55,379
the other four

2982
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,300
they're just people who want revenge on

2983
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:59,460
society the one out of five is a good

2984
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:01,320
person there for the right reason so

2985
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:02,939
just hope you get one of those one of

2986
01:53:01,319 --> 01:53:05,039
those one out of five

2987
01:53:02,939 --> 01:53:07,559
yeah I mean if you if you get off having

2988
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:10,019
an unreasonable amount of power off off

2989
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:13,940
of people in most situations that's not

2990
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:13,940
a bad career for you yeah

2991
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:20,880
it draws people with that bent you know

2992
01:53:17,819 --> 01:53:23,399
yeah exactly

2993
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,739
it does I mean Spain has always been

2994
01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:28,679
interesting to me because it's almost

2995
01:53:25,738 --> 01:53:31,500
like the only place in in like Western

2996
01:53:28,679 --> 01:53:34,800
Europe that has a climate that's like

2997
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:37,500
that's close to where I live to some

2998
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:40,020
degree you know uh when you look at the

2999
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:42,300
map of how much sun Europe gets versus

3000
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:43,800
how much sun America gets it's

3001
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:46,739
unbelievable

3002
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:50,039
uh how much sunnier large parts of

3003
01:53:46,738 --> 01:53:52,138
America are compared to Canada or you

3004
01:53:50,039 --> 01:53:53,519
know or compared to Europe

3005
01:53:52,139 --> 01:53:56,219
you know

3006
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:59,060
um and so you know did you get to grow

3007
01:53:56,219 --> 01:54:01,380
any any city did you get to was was

3008
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:02,699
Spain did you get to do some outdoor

3009
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:06,139
there did you get to do something yeah

3010
01:54:02,698 --> 01:54:06,138
did you get to try yeah

3011
01:54:07,219 --> 01:54:11,219
all the strings that I couldn't grow

3012
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:14,039
outdoors here in Canada I was able to

3013
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:16,439
grow in Spain and oh wow up here we're

3014
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:18,179
around the 50th parallel here and when I

3015
01:54:16,439 --> 01:54:20,638
lived in Spain we're around the 35th

3016
01:54:18,179 --> 01:54:22,139
pretty much the same latitude as uh

3017
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:25,380
Northern California like San Francisco

3018
01:54:22,139 --> 01:54:28,139
yeah where I lived in Spain and I was

3019
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:30,000
able to grow all my shaquillas the first

3020
01:54:28,139 --> 01:54:31,980
that's the first thing I did on my

3021
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,380
Island sweet skunk my grapefruit hazes

3022
01:54:31,979 --> 01:54:36,899
my Hawaiians first thing I did was

3023
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:38,880
planted those sativas and I a few big

3024
01:54:36,899 --> 01:54:41,519
properties there where I grow a bunch

3025
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:44,039
and then a few few patches in the

3026
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:46,380
mountains and then like I have some

3027
01:54:44,039 --> 01:54:47,760
questions on that because that's one of

3028
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:50,039
the that's the reason I brought it up

3029
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:51,539
was that I've done a bunch inside and I

3030
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:53,399
you know I obviously live in an area

3031
01:54:51,539 --> 01:54:54,899
where I get to do a bunch of sun grown

3032
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:57,059
too

3033
01:54:54,899 --> 01:54:59,339
um you were I would imagine you were

3034
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:03,179
primarily indoor in Canada for a long

3035
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:05,159
time right so then you go over to Spain

3036
01:55:03,179 --> 01:55:07,139
well you were just talking about let's

3037
01:55:05,158 --> 01:55:09,599
let's just focus on the stuff that you

3038
01:55:07,139 --> 01:55:12,600
couldn't grow outside in Canada yeah but

3039
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:14,280
you grew it inside in where in in Canada

3040
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:15,420
because that's where that's where it

3041
01:55:14,279 --> 01:55:17,279
could finish

3042
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:18,960
where there are strains of yours that

3043
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:20,399
did things you didn't expect were there

3044
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,679
things that when you've got to grow them

3045
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:24,479
in the sunlight you found some

3046
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:26,579
differences or you found some things

3047
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:27,779
that really surprised you

3048
01:55:26,579 --> 01:55:29,219
you know

3049
01:55:27,779 --> 01:55:31,559
because

3050
01:55:29,219 --> 01:55:32,460
not too much actually

3051
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,380
um

3052
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:36,719
maybe a little bit but I had already

3053
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:39,900
been growing for about 12 13 years

3054
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:41,520
before I moved to Spain so I kind of had

3055
01:55:39,899 --> 01:55:44,399
a good feel for

3056
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:47,219
how my varieties performed in different

3057
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:50,158
situations sure sometimes they wouldn't

3058
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:53,340
uh grow outdoors on the island but I

3059
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:56,879
would always had greenhouses so I had a

3060
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:58,980
good idea so of what what kind of what's

3061
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,800
going to express itself in the in this

3062
01:55:58,979 --> 01:56:04,319
election but uh

3063
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:05,940
yeah and you see anything like notably

3064
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:06,779
different over there like is that what

3065
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:09,238
we're trying to get at like the

3066
01:56:06,779 --> 01:56:11,158
expressions like from yeah like even

3067
01:56:09,238 --> 01:56:13,379
I'll give you a couple examples so like

3068
01:56:11,158 --> 01:56:14,879
the chem family that I run and some

3069
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:17,279
different stuff like that if you grow it

3070
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:20,100
inside it grows a certain way

3071
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:22,259
if you grow It Outdoors you'll get hot

3072
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:25,199
pink to magenta hairs on it quite a bit

3073
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:26,639
that I'll never ever see inside but then

3074
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:30,359
sometimes if you grow out in the full

3075
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:32,400
sun you'll get a leafy Afghan mess where

3076
01:56:30,359 --> 01:56:34,920
if I grow it like say under like woven

3077
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:36,719
poly that takes out some of the UV and I

3078
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:41,060
grow it smaller like in a greenhouse

3079
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:41,060
I'll get like a more indoor expression

3080
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:52,020
uh outdoors in Spain um

3081
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:54,179
a lot of the red hairs would come out on

3082
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:57,239
the wrong one that I never seen indoors

3083
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:59,639
or even in the greenhouse in Canada

3084
01:56:57,238 --> 01:57:01,738
um sure that the red hairs in Spain just

3085
01:56:59,639 --> 01:57:04,859
were popping out it was it was beautiful

3086
01:57:01,738 --> 01:57:06,178
beautiful looking plant uh

3087
01:57:04,859 --> 01:57:08,460
yeah

3088
01:57:06,179 --> 01:57:11,779
other than that not not a big difference

3089
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:14,579
uh in most strains

3090
01:57:11,779 --> 01:57:16,259
interesting because I feel like indoor

3091
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:17,340
you can have you have control over

3092
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:20,099
everything

3093
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:21,840
but the light the you know there's not a

3094
01:57:20,099 --> 01:57:23,940
better light that I've experienced than

3095
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,920
the sun I've tried all kinds of

3096
01:57:23,939 --> 01:57:28,259
different combinations and mixed light

3097
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:31,319
inside and you can kind of approximate

3098
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:33,840
it but like it's weird like I would

3099
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:35,698
bring a lot of my strains

3100
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,560
um and like some old euros and stuff

3101
01:57:35,698 --> 01:57:39,419
like that like Neville and Shanti and

3102
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,920
some old guys actually told me this

3103
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:44,039
where they were like if you want to keep

3104
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:47,599
old moms healthy try to give them three

3105
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:47,599
or four months a year of sunlight

3106
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:53,639
yeah that makes sense yeah and I would

3107
01:57:51,479 --> 01:57:55,259
take my plants in February or March and

3108
01:57:53,639 --> 01:57:56,639
I would put them into a greenhouse and I

3109
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:58,800
would think they looked pretty healthy

3110
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:00,719
and then after about a month of being

3111
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:01,920
outside I'd be like man these things are

3112
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:04,500
banging

3113
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,599
these things are really happy these

3114
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:08,219
plants are really growing well and so

3115
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:09,539
there's something about like just that

3116
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:13,139
full spectrum

3117
01:58:09,539 --> 01:58:15,599
where it has all the spectrums in spades

3118
01:58:13,139 --> 01:58:17,520
I will say indoor

3119
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:19,739
I indoor I can kind of do the same kind

3120
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:22,739
of trick though with the revenge like a

3121
01:58:19,738 --> 01:58:24,359
Sim not maybe not as as vigorous because

3122
01:58:22,738 --> 01:58:26,459
it's not the sunlight and obviously

3123
01:58:24,359 --> 01:58:28,380
plants prefer the sunlight because of

3124
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:30,779
the spectrum but you can get like that

3125
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:33,480
little bit of a a vigorous re-jump on

3126
01:58:30,779 --> 01:58:36,179
plants with the Revenge uh

3127
01:58:33,479 --> 01:58:38,218
at least I found like especially for

3128
01:58:36,179 --> 01:58:42,500
breeding and stuff Old Stock

3129
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:42,500
um old mom stop arrive Edge does wonders

3130
01:58:42,539 --> 01:58:47,779
yeah uh yeah there's nothing nothing

3131
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:47,779
better than this on so

3132
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:51,658
outdoor guys

3133
01:58:50,039 --> 01:58:53,519
I mean it's just it's one of those

3134
01:58:51,658 --> 01:58:55,198
things where you know the only reason

3135
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,300
why I asked is because if you're stuck

3136
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,279
up there not stuck but if you're in

3137
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:01,800
Northern like you know there's certain

3138
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:04,738
sativas there's certain things that like

3139
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:06,900
even for my area like it doesn't stay

3140
01:59:04,738 --> 01:59:10,019
nice into December

3141
01:59:06,899 --> 01:59:11,759
I can't I can't in my environment you

3142
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:14,699
know like I can't grow certain

3143
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,679
equatorial stuff and get away with it it

3144
01:59:14,698 --> 01:59:18,299
just doesn't finish and so then there's

3145
01:59:16,679 --> 01:59:19,618
these there's these things where it's

3146
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,940
like the only thing I've ever

3147
01:59:19,618 --> 01:59:24,359
experienced with them is growing them

3148
01:59:20,939 --> 01:59:26,279
inside yeah because I can't take a 16 20

3149
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:28,920
weaker and see what it does in a

3150
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:30,719
greenhouse yeah unless I've got added

3151
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:32,158
light and mad heat and all these

3152
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:33,779
different things that we typically don't

3153
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:35,460
around

3154
01:59:33,779 --> 01:59:36,840
you know so I was just curious if you

3155
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:38,698
like when he went there did he get to

3156
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:40,319
see different things from strains that

3157
01:59:38,698 --> 01:59:41,879
like especially when you were talking

3158
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:43,500
about some of these like 16 week

3159
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:45,480
Mexicans and different things that

3160
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:47,158
you're Crossing if you got to play

3161
01:59:45,479 --> 01:59:49,319
around with those more because the

3162
01:59:47,158 --> 01:59:51,658
weather was just nicer

3163
01:59:49,319 --> 01:59:53,460
well I I uh I really like playing with

3164
01:59:51,658 --> 01:59:56,279
my grapefruit Haze and my Island sweets

3165
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:59,099
Come Those are the two strains that I

3166
01:59:56,279 --> 02:00:01,859
can never finish properly in Canada and

3167
01:59:59,099 --> 02:00:04,319
down there I was growing monster monster

3168
02:00:01,859 --> 02:00:07,198
plants uh like four or five pounds of

3169
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:09,920
plant and just that that

3170
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:13,259
lemony hazy flavor

3171
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:16,380
that was just and just branches and

3172
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:18,360
branches of wake

3173
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:20,039
um it just can't and they did actually

3174
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:21,359
grow a lot a bit of a different

3175
02:00:20,039 --> 02:00:24,658
structure than indoors they're a lot

3176
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:26,579
branchier uh both of those terrains

3177
02:00:24,658 --> 02:00:28,799
um indoors maybe it's because I have a

3178
02:00:26,579 --> 02:00:31,279
growing technique indoors okay keep the

3179
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:31,279
plants close

3180
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:36,238
so much different when you're outside

3181
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:38,039
for the most part too right you're not

3182
02:00:36,238 --> 02:00:39,658
just growing in feet yeah well actually

3183
02:00:38,039 --> 02:00:42,899
I didn't do most of my plants were

3184
02:00:39,658 --> 02:00:45,238
growing in containers so uh yeah so yeah

3185
02:00:42,899 --> 02:00:47,698
the soil was pretty similar um

3186
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:49,559
but yeah other than that yeah

3187
02:00:47,698 --> 02:00:50,519
what was the island Street skunk again

3188
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:52,920
real quick

3189
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:55,500
what's that the island sweets Gunk what

3190
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:57,300
was that one again

3191
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:00,920
um that was selected from uh breeder

3192
02:00:57,300 --> 02:01:03,739
Steve's uh sweet skunk

3193
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:07,319
do we remember or did we not know um

3194
02:01:03,738 --> 02:01:10,919
nobody really knows I think

3195
02:01:07,319 --> 02:01:12,960
um you have to ask uh red or Steve about

3196
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:14,819
that red would probably be the best uh

3197
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:17,340
source of info I may have I don't

3198
02:01:14,819 --> 02:01:20,658
remember he thought it was in Northern

3199
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:20,659
Lights 1005 Hayes

3200
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:27,300
grape rude what I think it was

3201
02:01:25,219 --> 02:01:30,980
it was

3202
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:33,779
I'm pretty sure that's what it is

3203
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:35,399
man another one I'm not remembering it

3204
02:01:33,779 --> 02:01:37,979
wrong but if I remember correctly that's

3205
02:01:35,399 --> 02:01:39,598
what red thought it was some NLP rays

3206
02:01:37,979 --> 02:01:41,819
and it maybe at some point was added

3207
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:44,340
into Rick got grapefruit or something

3208
02:01:41,819 --> 02:01:46,198
like that added to it

3209
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:47,819
um and then and then he was saying that

3210
02:01:46,198 --> 02:01:50,039
there was a difference

3211
02:01:47,819 --> 02:01:51,719
talking about Mark Emery again there was

3212
02:01:50,039 --> 02:01:52,800
a difference between the original sweet

3213
02:01:51,719 --> 02:01:56,399
skunk

3214
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:59,340
and then people gave seeds to mark

3215
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:02,098
and he was and he he added the island

3216
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:06,840
and he and he sold some different Weird

3217
02:02:02,099 --> 02:02:06,840
Hybrids of it and stuff like that yeah

3218
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:15,900
when Mike and I started Federation

3219
02:02:14,158 --> 02:02:17,399
um we had a clone of the island sweet

3220
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:18,598
scum or the sweet skunk that was going

3221
02:02:17,399 --> 02:02:21,598
around the city

3222
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:24,239
we got a cut we made our own cross with

3223
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:25,260
it and it is Island sweet skunk instead

3224
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:26,519
of sweets

3225
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:28,800
yeah

3226
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:30,119
but you kind of had to because Steve did

3227
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,360
not want you using his [Â __Â ] name

3228
02:02:30,118 --> 02:02:36,000
right like Steve was like oh no no he

3229
02:02:33,359 --> 02:02:37,319
didn't like that very much yeah but but

3230
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,800
I I was trying to give him give him

3231
02:02:37,319 --> 02:02:43,500
credit for it he didn't like that sure

3232
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:44,880
yeah back in the day I I get it in the

3233
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:47,039
beginning I was that way too and people

3234
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:48,719
would knock off my string and just

3235
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:50,519
rename it

3236
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,739
kind of bugged me a bit in the first

3237
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:55,500
years but nowadays

3238
02:02:52,738 --> 02:02:56,539
like yeah everybody this far in

3239
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:59,279
um

3240
02:02:56,539 --> 02:03:02,279
you're going with good genetics somebody

3241
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:04,579
exactly copying you it's a it's a

3242
02:03:02,279 --> 02:03:07,679
compliment it's not a ripple yes

3243
02:03:04,579 --> 02:03:10,319
so I always felt like a compliment with

3244
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:13,020
somebody would take your strain and grow

3245
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:14,759
it themselves I almost thought a bigger

3246
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:17,520
compliment with somebody would take your

3247
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:19,020
strain grow it themselves rename it as

3248
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:23,060
something else so they would get the

3249
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:23,060
credit for it if it was good enough

3250
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:29,099
you know because every single person

3251
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:31,260
that's if you never want anyone to grow

3252
02:03:29,099 --> 02:03:33,300
your strains then you can't have a seed

3253
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:34,920
company you can't let them out you can't

3254
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:37,380
have friends do it because that's the

3255
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:38,399
most classic thing in weed is people are

3256
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:40,739
going to take it and they're going to do

3257
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:43,679
what they want with it always

3258
02:03:40,738 --> 02:03:47,279
they're gonna buy somebody else's work

3259
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:50,279
before me yeah yeah it's just the most I

3260
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:52,679
mean you know I uh you know Neville you

3261
02:03:50,279 --> 02:03:55,679
know Neville got hella bitter because he

3262
02:03:52,679 --> 02:03:57,840
thought 90 of the Amsterdam scene was

3263
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:59,880
people just buying and biting his seed

3264
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:01,260
work yeah he did

3265
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:04,500
and then you know and then you don't get

3266
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:06,300
loot for it yeah but that's the that and

3267
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:09,060
that I think honestly that's also what

3268
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:11,279
led to a bunch of seed companies like

3269
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:12,840
never wanting to reveal what was in

3270
02:04:11,279 --> 02:04:15,479
their actual mix

3271
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:17,760
because they got tired of competing seed

3272
02:04:15,479 --> 02:04:20,519
companies using the exact same verbiage

3273
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:22,380
on their advertisements and the exact

3274
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:24,179
same lineage

3275
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:25,920
you know so people started getting all

3276
02:04:24,179 --> 02:04:27,359
secretive about their about their mix

3277
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,760
and what was in it and what the sauce

3278
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:33,118
was and what they used

3279
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:35,460
because they didn't want people to know

3280
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:37,380
yes that's the way she goes that's the

3281
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:38,819
way it works did you have anything else

3282
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:41,219
on your list that you wanted to get in

3283
02:04:38,819 --> 02:04:42,719
because we were about two hours in I

3284
02:04:41,219 --> 02:04:44,219
mean if there's anything else you had

3285
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:46,500
