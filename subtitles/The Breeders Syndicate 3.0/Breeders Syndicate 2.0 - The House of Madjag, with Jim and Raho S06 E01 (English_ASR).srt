and Rico so uh this is one of the

17
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,920
episodes I've probably been looking

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,079
forward to the most since we've started

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
um and and I'll I'll leave it up to

20
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,859
Magic to kind of start his tale because

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,359
I this is one I couldn't possibly begin

22
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,459
to start

23
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,280
um so magic when you started getting

24
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,438
into growing what was the impetus what

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,879
was the start

26
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,599
hmm

27
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,759
well the start was a friend of mine who

28
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,339
was a dealer in Tempe

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,438
um weed dealer

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,299
he saw all kinds of loads coming through

31
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,819
over the years

32
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,100
um from the late 60s to uh

33
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:47,339
let's say 73 74 and he would high grade

34
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,239
the seeds these were all seeded loads at

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,880
first

36
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,759
um so if you had guerreran or if he had

37
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,239
oaxacan he would if he found that it was

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,700
a great strain he would keep the seeds

39
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,759
and over time he started collecting all

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,640
these seeds and then one day around 1975

41
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,680
he said why don't we just gross our own

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,818
with these seeds instead of having to

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
deal with

44
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,299
um the supporting this stuff so

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,760
so we

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,239
um decided to test that theory and

47
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:22,199
that's the very first grow in 1976 I did

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,959
with um him and I went up and found the

49
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,839
spot that we would potentially use in a

50
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,900
remote Canyon along the Mogan rim

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,020
ogan Rim is spelled like mogulon but

52
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,360
it's pronounced maggion or mogion and

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,879
it's the southernmost edge of the

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,340
Colorado Plateau so it stretches from

55
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,039
roughly from Williams Arizona all the

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,439
way to Mogan New Mexico 200 miles wide

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,120
this edge of the plateau and along the

58
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,280
edge are all these

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,259
cracks let's call them and they're

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,060
they're Canyons with streams year-round

61
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,340
streams there's probably

62
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,620
I'd say 20 Canyons with year-round

63
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,039
streams in that 200 miles

64
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,560
and we chose one of them

65
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:07,139
and and when you decided to choose that

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,878
was it because there you knew for a fact

67
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,098
there was no like real human interaction

68
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,780
there is it just so remote that nobody

69
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,539
was going down there

70
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,360
that's that's pretty much it

71
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:21,199
uh Hunters stay up on top of the plateau

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,260
edges and stuff or they're way way down

73
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:29,280
in areas that are easier to ex

74
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:32,280
more accessible sure to hike down 1600

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,098
feet into a canyon down a boulder stream

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,878
wash through bushes and stuff

77
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,039
um

78
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,419
Hunters wouldn't do it because if they

79
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,259
shoot anything they'd have to carry it

80
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:46,500
out and yeah it's just way too remote

81
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:48,120
and the criteria was we wanted it had to

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,919
have a year-round stream

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,379
so we had to make sure that it was

84
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
flowing in the heart of the summer

85
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,818
and

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,039
um a Jeep Trail dirt road that led close

87
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:02,339
to it so we wouldn't have to hike more

88
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,179
than maybe two hours one way yeah and

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,400
then

90
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,560
um we began testing it in different ways

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,260
I I'd have my friend who was the dealer

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,938
from Tempe walk around down below while

93
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,639
I was up on the rim and we had

94
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:17,040
walkie-talkies back then this is pretty

95
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,339
cell phone so

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,019
um you just you know I I just go oh I

97
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,060
can see you you're wearing a white

98
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,478
T-shirt

99
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:30,300
so that was that had to change and then

100
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,279
he had a straw hat that had to change

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,319
um just can't be doing those things if

102
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,099
you're in the bottom of a canyon and

103
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:41,879
yeah Cowboys ranchers still use these

104
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,280
areas back in the early 70s they were uh

105
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,339
they were grazing cows there even though

106
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,399
it was National Forest the forest would

107
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:53,039
was allowing them I think their their

108
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,219
permits go back to the 1920s or 30s or

109
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,520
40s and they just allowed them to uh

110
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,120
continue on and they got Tighter and

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,918
Tighter and then eventually by oh let's

112
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,060
see

113
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,659
late

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,639
late 70s they stopped all the grazing in

115
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,660
these areas in this particular area

116
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,660
which was great yeah

117
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,579
a canyon away

118
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,300
um some guys from Jerome were growing

119
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:26,099
and they parked there every week week

120
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,379
after week after week at the end of a

121
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,879
Jeep Trail and finally the ranch are

122
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,978
using that area called the forest

123
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,959
service and they came out and ran the

124
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,000
plates and found oh wow they're from

125
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,659
Jerome the hippie capital of Northern

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,720
Arizona so that didn't their scene

127
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,280
yet and they didn't wait for them they

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,919
just they didn't want to go down inside

129
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,198
in case you know it would become a

130
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,939
shootout or something so they waited

131
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,400
till they harvested it and took it all

132
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,160
back to Jerome and then they busted on a

133
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,198
Jerome it was like a hundred pounds

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,939
oh no and they didn't have any effect on

135
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,120
you guys

136
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:06,240
no it it bothered us because they were

137
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,600
within five miles by air of where we

138
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,060
were but it's so remote and so difficult

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,340
they chose a canyon that was a lot

140
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,899
better known and people were known for

141
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,959
hiking through it and swimming through

142
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,579
it because it was very long had sections

143
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,620
of wall-to-wall water you had to swim

144
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:28,198
our Cannon was unknown and you couldn't

145
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,939
hike down from the top because there was

146
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,079
a spot we called

147
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,519
um

148
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:37,079
oh what land not Lands End the Hall of

149
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,839
the Mountain King is what we called it

150
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,120
it was a hundred foot waterfall drop off

151
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,219
and you can't you couldn't you couldn't

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,259
go down it so we never had to worry

153
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,780
about anyone hiking Downstream from

154
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,100
where it started as a watch five miles

155
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,918
away

156
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,939
so how did you guys again did you guys

157
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,620
go in a certain way that that made it

158
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,478
accessible enough obviously for you guys

159
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,538
but other people didn't know

160
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:07,199
yep we drove Five Mile Jeep Trail

161
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:09,060
the first well this first time with my

162
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,538
friend from Tempe it was about a three

163
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,519
mile Jeep Trail and then maybe a

164
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:18,599
thousand foot drop off down into the

165
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:21,060
canyon and it it was a canyon that at

166
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,120
the top was heavily used by swimmers and

167
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,339
and people who were into

168
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,220
um Crystal Clear Pools and things like

169
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,500
that but the lower part where we were

170
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,319
um there was no one we never left

171
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,019
Footprints either we these beautiful

172
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,300
sand bars that are long creeks and edges

173
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,219
we would just avoid them because we knew

174
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,598
that if anyone did hike through that's

175
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,060
the first place they would walk because

176
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,620
it was easier so we could always check

177
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,839
for footprints

178
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,180
and our primary Canyon magic Canyon

179
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,638
which came the next year

180
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,319
um in five years we only saw one set of

181
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,120
footprints wow ironically my partner

182
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,098
picked up a hitchhiker on the way back

183
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,740
through the nearest town and he was the

184
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:07,199
guy who had hiked through there so we we

185
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,439
found out he he was all excited because

186
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,720
he had hiked this 12 Mile Canyon and saw

187
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,978
nobody and he had hiked right by our

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,740
Gardens and never knew it you know

189
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:22,818
yeah so that was good karma

190
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,800
meeting the guy

191
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,539
what I what I find so interesting when I

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,240
was when I was reading a little bit

193
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:32,098
about your your history and stuff is how

194
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,538
similar

195
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,278
um although although a little bit

196
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,019
different just due to geography like

197
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,120
when I first moved to Mendocino County

198
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:42,360
and we were doing gorilla before the

199
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,219
medical era really started uh was how

200
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,139
similar the criteria was

201
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,360
and that you were looking for somewhere

202
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,699
very remote

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,980
inaccessible uh normal people hikers

204
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,379
Hunters various people would never go

205
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,139
there but you needed water

206
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:00,539
uh and you couldn't really take a

207
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,039
vehicle up there or even like dirt bikes

208
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,360
or anything because you never wanted to

209
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,919
leave a trail that would have been

210
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,919
visible from the air

211
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,419
so you would only get so so close and

212
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,879
then the rest of it was sort of hoofing

213
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,500
it in and even hoofing it in from like

214
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,958
different angles so that you wouldn't

215
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,879
create a path in summer

216
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,338
that would be visible

217
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,620
was that can I uh let me interject a

218
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:26,700
question were they flying looking for

219
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,299
weed then or was that too early for that

220
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,160
um it was too early they there were

221
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,500
there were people who talked about that

222
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,259
that going on but we never saw that

223
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,958
happen we did have a helicopter land in

224
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,240
our Canyon in the only spot that was

225
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,179
wide enough this is another weird one

226
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,600
and their tracks went about the tracks

227
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:51,179
from the helicopter went about 400 yards

228
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,800
down the canyon stopped and then went

229
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,379
back and

230
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,479
we thought we were dreaming because we

231
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,458
didn't see the helicopter we just saw

232
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,800
these tracks and we followed them to

233
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,018
this little opening but when we got down

234
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,500
on our knees and looked carefully

235
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:10,919
little frag little pieces of paint had

236
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,899
had chipped off the helicopters

237
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,659
um I forget whether those the skids

238
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,519
let's call them yeah and left on the

239
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:19,819
Rocks because this volcanic rock so it's

240
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,320
very sharp so we knew we were

241
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,360
hallucinating and a helicopter had

242
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,040
landed there and later we found out it

243
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,360
was Eagle stud ears

244
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:32,219
oh from the University in in we're not

245
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,959
sure which university but they were

246
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,300
checking out all the Canyons up there

247
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,039
and and getting out and Hiking if they

248
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:43,019
saw eagles and trying to get some

249
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:46,139
numbers for their studies so we we felt

250
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,820
okay but the the actual looking for

251
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,360
plants

252
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:54,778
um you know if you were to open if you

253
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,639
were to like clear a huge wide area and

254
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:57,778
leave it open and then just start

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,639
growing

256
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:01,740
such that you could stand on the edge of

257
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,879
a canyon and look down in and go hey

258
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,000
what's that

259
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,860
um that would be bad yeah so you have to

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,879
go in and out between the bushes make

261
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,639
little

262
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,899
patties that flowed from one to the next

263
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,480
level and

264
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,320
work it out and then later we even found

265
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,778
out

266
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,720
it made sense because we were up on the

267
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:25,259
rim looking down after

268
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,720
watering and the reflection on the mud

269
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,419
was very obvious that this was an area

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,060
that had gotten water so every time we

271
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:35,159
watered which was once a week we spread

272
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,899
oak leaves and whatever leaves were

273
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,719
there we started piling them up in

274
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:43,100
advance and just threw them on top and

275
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,060
totally stopped the reflection

276
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,879
a lot of things

277
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,699
we painted all of our hose connections

278
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:53,220
with brown spray flat

279
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,940
sure spray paint so it wouldn't reflect

280
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,600
uh we never wore white t-shirts or hats

281
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,000
um

282
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,700
we we had this photo that you have up

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,159
right now that's my first my second part

284
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,160
he's my first partner in Magic because

285
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:11,399
the guy I started with who's the dealer

286
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,919
we um went separate ways kind of because

287
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,958
he didn't he lived in Tempe and it

288
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,838
wasn't just wasn't feasible for him to

289
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,059
come up and do this every week so I

290
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,600
lived in the Verde Valley which I was

291
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,000
still over an hour away but it made more

292
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,278
sense and this fellow that you see here

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,899
was my first partner he lived in flag

294
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,299
and

295
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,240
this is what the creek looked like

296
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,979
year-round water this Pond right here is

297
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,680
what we pumped out of

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,139
and our first Garden was 90 feet

299
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,319
above the the creek level

300
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:48,180
so we used a Briggs and Stratton four

301
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,660
horsepower

302
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:55,138
um two inch fire hose

303
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,539
and if it was it wouldn't pump up 90

304
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:02,459
feet so yeah you had to drop down to a

305
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:06,958
garden hose adapter that it forced it up

306
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:07,619
to 90 feet we just appreciated yeah

307
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,479
um

308
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,159
there's different pumps we could have

309
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,560
gotten for more money like six

310
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:17,039
horsepower that weighed 150 pounds or

311
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,199
something and uh yeah but we we it

312
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,539
worked so it took two hours that first

313
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,300
Garden to just move the hose around we

314
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:26,819
only had one hose and we'd just move it

315
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:29,759
in subsequent years we created um

316
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,800
systems of hoses so you just you know

317
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,799
they all just watered

318
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,860
those filled up little patties and then

319
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,899
those

320
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,539
pour it over onto the next level and to

321
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,458
the next level because the the train was

322
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,679
relatively flat on these alluvial

323
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:50,278
plateaus but you know maybe a foot or

324
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:53,759
two of of differences plus we we raked

325
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:56,100
it and leveled it and used rocks to to

326
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,338
outline little patties so that maybe

327
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,019
there'd be two or three plants yeah on a

328
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,760
Patty and then the next one would be

329
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,120
next to it it would drop off

330
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,879
we have free hoses though too uh that

331
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,100
were on Siamese shutoffs and we could

332
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,320
open them up and then you know spot hit

333
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,480
other plants and yeah it worked pretty

334
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,940
well we spent a lot of time developing

335
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,259
our hose Network on subsequent years

336
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,680
sounds like after that first

337
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:26,159
[Music]

338
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,539
you know Matt magic this is rajo so just

339
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,179
I want to jump in there you know you're

340
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:31,019
talking about all these gorilla

341
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:32,399
um

342
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,620
tactics

343
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,778
and you know this is back in the 70s

344
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,519
you're talking about could when you were

345
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,278
when you were doing all this stuff was

346
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,078
any of this kind of inspired by the war

347
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,019
that we had just finished fighting in

348
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,879
Vietnam and you know the everything that

349
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,078
we used to hear on the news all the time

350
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,480
about

351
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,059
the Guerrilla Fighters over there and

352
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,860
how they concealed what they did I know

353
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,299
that when I was doing my gorilla stuff

354
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,459
it was

355
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:02,039
you know I'm listening to your stories

356
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:04,799
and it's exactly like what I did except

357
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,899
my stuff was all green and not not rock

358
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,299
you know

359
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,720
but uh where where was your inspiration

360
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,719
for

361
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,259
the whole catalog

362
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,000
the written word has always been my

363
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,198
guide and

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,399
um

365
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:24,179
this is

366
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,440
um

367
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:31,679
domestic Growers Supply catalog from

368
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,779
1981 1980 and

369
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:38,099
I read about this in the whole earth

370
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:39,958
catalog and I I wrote in a way for it

371
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,060
look at these waterbed

372
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,379
classical tanks to fit in the back of

373
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,539
your truck so you can pull up to the

374
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,778
edge of a canyon and I knew people who

375
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:51,539
use this method then all

376
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:53,820
gravity feed downhill for 600 feet to

377
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:57,059
their spot and

378
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,480
um this this is a small little thing

379
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:03,479
small little catalog it has but it does

380
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,139
have a very nice section on

381
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,680
on pumps and

382
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:13,100
these guys I don't know once we started

383
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:17,338
making their second catalog in color

384
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,680
1982 and they were based out of I think

385
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:23,699
Oregon let's see where this is

386
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:27,539
um but they have all kinds of

387
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:29,639
guzzler pumps hand operated

388
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:30,599
um where you just that wouldn't work for

389
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,539
us but

390
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,259
yeah we've had a few times where

391
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:39,539
things broke and we had to Water by hand

392
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:43,699
using five gallon jugs dipping them in

393
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:47,219
the watering them well it takes

394
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:49,620
but but you you can't neglect it because

395
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,720
you're there to water in oh it was good

396
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,419
the way we did it

397
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,300
we were fortunate because one week

398
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:59,399
we would flood irrigate we estimated in

399
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,958
subsequent years that we were putting 20

400
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,939
000 gallons on

401
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,859
on our little gardens so that was it in

402
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,959
this soft dirt that we used it would

403
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:13,198
sink nice and deep and then the roots

404
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,360
would follow it oh yeah it's but you

405
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,179
couldn't go two weeks if you went like

406
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,279
even 10 days which we tried to do a few

407
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,140
times you'd come back and all the plants

408
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,000
were wilted and drooping and heard

409
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,939
freaked out because we thought we had

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,439
messed up and we went ahead and watered

411
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,860
the next morning everything was standing

412
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,900
up perfect and looking beautiful

413
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:37,199
they're amazing plants how they can

414
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,140
be almost shriveled and then one water

415
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,960
resistant or just yeah did you ever use

416
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:46,559
any like uh any water retention crystals

417
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,298
or anything like that to extend

418
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,639
um because that was that was some that

419
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:52,079
was some technique that it you know like

420
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,759
by the time that I got to Mendocino

421
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,639
County and started doing stuff like that

422
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,960
there was our already a lot of like I

423
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,240
don't know if you want to call it Hill

424
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,880
Tech or older people that were passing

425
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,919
down how to get away with things

426
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,320
um infrequent watering was always well

427
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,759
how do you retain the water how do you

428
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,619
how do you keep it how do you keep

429
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,980
things wet when you're only checking on

430
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:18,538
things every so often

431
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,960
so our Canyon was 12 miles long and we

432
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:24,179
we hiked it up and down to find the two

433
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,700
spots that we this was the first spot

434
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,620
that's on the camera right now but the

435
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,600
other two spots we found were up Canyon

436
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:33,599
and

437
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,119
we you just don't come across alluvial

438
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,538
plateaus at water level they're up at

439
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,699
least 20 feet above and we had to

440
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:43,500
scramble up and look and scramble up and

441
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,940
we'd be up in the room and look down and

442
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,558
say hey that looks like a good spot and

443
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,038
then go back the next week and check it

444
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:53,279
but when we finally found our two spots

445
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:57,179
um this soil is wind deposited over

446
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:59,700
centuries and decades multitudes and it

447
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:02,700
was so nice there was rocks in there big

448
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,819
boulders as you can see here but in this

449
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,860
our very first place down below here is

450
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,058
where that photo was taken

451
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,178
and

452
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:15,178
this is at almost at Harvest you can see

453
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,960
the size of the coal is beautiful and

454
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,840
um

455
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,900
we um the soil was just this beautiful

456
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:25,199
Rich volcanic soil although when Robert

457
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,798
Clark came down in the second year of

458
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,440
our new location not this one he said he

459
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,179
couldn't believe we were growing in dirt

460
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,880
and I said what do you mean the dirt and

461
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,059
he said well in Mendocino and up in

462
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,120
North it's not dirt like this it's soil

463
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:45,538
like black rich soil and ours was brown

464
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:48,239
and gray and just dirt but yeah it was

465
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:50,099
easy to shovel so that meant that the

466
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,339
water penetrated it and so did Roots

467
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:56,579
very easily we turned the soil down 18

468
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:59,459
inches I think and the only amendment we

469
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:02,579
ever added were bone meal and blood meal

470
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,400
oh wow that was it we didn't have to do

471
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:08,038
a folio story and the foliar spray saved

472
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,679
us from this twisting Leaf thing that we

473
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:13,500
it was a micronutrient that was missing

474
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,440
we think it was molybdenum but we uh

475
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,900
sprayed the plants and it saved our

476
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,000
butts because they all untwisted

477
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,640
no that's nice but that's it

478
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,579
just so when you were when you were let

479
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,160
me ask a question in terms of

480
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,960
um when did the growing season like when

481
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,660
were you when was it nice enough outside

482
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,319
that you were able to plant and how much

483
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,900
work did you do to prep in the winter

484
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,579
spring off Seasons like you said you

485
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,919
turned the soil and you had to run all

486
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:46,558
these hoses and prep all this different

487
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,660
stuff how much pregame went into like

488
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,700
preparing the areas you were thinking

489
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,640
about using

490
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,080
we had November and December and January

491
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,640
off and then we were back out in

492
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,240
February

493
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,640
um we you know preparing

494
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,099
we we started small like this Garden

495
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,220
here you're looking at in this boat is

496
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:10,798
probably 100 feet by 50 feet with

497
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,500
Boulders and trees and stuff in it it

498
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,379
it's it Blended in pretty well even from

499
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,220
the Italian did really well yeah

500
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:23,880
however the next Garden we used was

501
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,558
three times the size of this and if we

502
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,059
plant it in between bushes and trees

503
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,038
which you'll I'm sure you've seen in

504
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:31,918
some of the photos and

505
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,558
but when there were no plants those

506
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,900
between the bushes and trees were the

507
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,058
patties were I'm just calling them that

508
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,100
we had to build up with rocks and have

509
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:42,779
it spill over to the next Garden in the

510
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,359
next or in the next Patty and the next

511
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:48,720
one but we had free hoses too to be able

512
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,579
to walk around and in water with

513
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,579
it took

514
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,798
I don't know months of perhaps the very

515
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:00,000
first time because we had to bring down

516
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:02,639
so much stuff and then the third year we

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,319
grew we did two gardens that was The Big

518
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,559
Year and that's the year that Rob Clark

519
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:11,519
came down to see he he only came down to

520
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:14,279
see the one easiest to reach garden and

521
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:18,179
in this this photo is kind of an early

522
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,899
photo of that first Garden yeah these

523
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:23,220
are little tiny pipes in here in these

524
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,159
let's see if we can get actually that

525
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,919
that first Garden was so was that

526
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,020
primarily uh different different types

527
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,600
of Mexican that your dealer friend had

528
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:36,918
collected was that was that the primary

529
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,918
seed stock for the first season

530
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,580
I mean you were saying stuff about

531
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:45,240
oaxacan I believe and some other things

532
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:47,879
yeah is there any Colombian and stuff

533
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,579
yeah but the first year we just grew the

534
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,580
Mexican strains and it was in this other

535
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:56,699
Canyon that people actually went to the

536
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:59,038
top of it and would swim there but

537
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,340
our Canyon

538
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:05,179
we didn't start till my partner that you

539
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:07,500
saw down there next to the water

540
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,360
that I'll hold it right here if you

541
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,298
could hold that one but which one the

542
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,339
last one or this one yeah the last photo

543
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:15,960
okay

544
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:19,019
I was trying to jump through this one

545
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,240
that one this one you can see how they

546
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,000
stand out

547
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,880
yeah definitely the canvas

548
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,599
The Evergreens here were giant Pines and

549
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,460
small shrub oak trees and bushes

550
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:36,000
but from the rim

551
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,279
it didn't look too too blocky you know

552
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,019
they were scattered out if you really

553
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,178
knew what you were looking for yeah you

554
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,940
would have spotted this from 1600 feet

555
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:47,280
above but no one really went to those

556
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,779
edges in those Canyons this was not and

557
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,879
especially when it's 100 degrees out

558
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:55,440
yeah

559
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,860
it it was difficult so this is just I'd

560
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,259
say this is one half of this Garden it

561
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:03,899
extends over here and over here and this

562
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,058
was only 30 feet above above the creek

563
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,740
but it was in the spot that you would

564
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:11,158
never expect it and we hiked up there

565
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,380
when holy cow this is perfect so we were

566
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,320
able to pump two inches of water in a

567
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,299
two inch fire hose up to this flat and

568
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,639
that's why we put about 20 000 gallons

569
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:23,879
on here every week

570
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,679
and so wild do you mind the stories how

571
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,280
old you were

572
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:32,519
I was 28. 28.

573
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,158
yep 28 and 29 and 30. when we were doing

574
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,558
these three can these three Gardens that

575
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,780
you're seeing here yeah I

576
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:43,259
my partner was the same age we were all

577
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:45,599
just you know late 20s or in right

578
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:50,579
around 30 when we started doing this in

579
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:52,798
76 though I was only 25. mm-hmm

580
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:55,980
are you are you still in contact with

581
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,440

582
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,700

that's awesome that's freaking awesome

584
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,220
yeah the the relatively speaking the

585
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,880
dealer from Tempe has

586
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,240
um

587
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,059
what's that disease he's now in a

588
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,440

591
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,480
another partner who was the very last

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,860
one I worked with he was a friend we all

593

knew each other

594
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,839
independently I mean it was great

595
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:35,159
because we're all originally friends

596
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:39,599

memory but he can't drive a car he yeah

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,460
my that'll be great my my pilot friend

623
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,120
who

624
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,940
he's in the chronicle I wrote called

625
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,759
um I know the guy who knows the guy yeah

626
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,620
he I just talked to him a few days ago

627
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,500
he called me because he just fell and

628
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:11,819
broke his hip

629
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,798
I was going to invite him to be on this

630
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:16,019
show but

631
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,460
um he's in the hospital in Anchorage

632
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:20,038
Alaska now

633
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,679
I know bizarre so the universe didn't

634
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,740
want that to happen and I had kind of

635
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:29,580
thought he wouldn't want to he

636
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,859
he makes Mr Nice look small I I can

637
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:34,259
we'll go into his story later if you

638
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:37,379
don't mind yeah I'd love to the last

639
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,579
time I saw him physically in 1985 until

640
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,400
last year

641
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:45,538
they were just working on 60 tons of

642
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,880
hashish from Pakistan and this is the

643
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:51,900
level he worked at and

644
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,140
he retired never was busted it's

645
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:58,919
incredible you know he I know it's it's

646
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:01,559
amazing but if you knew him this is why

647
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,080
I I was so intent on getting this show

648
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,839
because I think you know we talk about a

649
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,339
lot of the people who who we I yeah

650
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:10,558
who've been put on a pedestal in our

651
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:13,319
scene um I mean of course Sam the skunk

652
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,058
man Rob Clark amazing people obviously

653
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,859
deserve their accolades I mean the big

654
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:19,379
heroes in the scene

655
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:23,099
um but there's some guys who did some

656
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:26,520
really big bold stuff that don't quite

657
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,839
get seen for many reasons a lot of it

658
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:29,639
has to do with the fact that it was

659
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,619
clandestine and illegal and it's in some

660
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,299
folks don't even still want to talk

661
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:34,859

664
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,759

to bring with you um raho I wanted to

666

get into a little bit with you raho can

667
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:47,819

collecting and getting into growing yeah

669
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:50,399

670
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,558

671
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,440
it's uh

672
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,740
man it seems like so long ago you know I

673
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,720
was just a kid uh 78 was the first time

674
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,640
I smoked weed and

675
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,100
back then you had to smoke you know

676
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,679
three four five times before you ever

677
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:11,099
actually felt the effect I don't know if

678
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,500
it was because the concentration of THC

679
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:16,319
wasn't so you know as high as it is

680
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,898
today or maybe

681
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,658
um the stuff that kids could buy on the

682
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:24,898
street back then wasn't so great but uh

683
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:28,080
you know by the time by the time

684
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:31,259
I got high that very first time you know

685
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,240
I was 15 years old uh after school at a

686
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,798
buddy's house and

687
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,038
um

688
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,319
you know we it took a while to kick in

689
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:43,019
and

690
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:45,359
after I was I was actually riding my

691
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:48,418
bike home thinking oh you know another

692
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:51,119
time that it didn't work when it started

693
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:54,419
to hit me right and it was a beautiful

694
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,819
spring day the sun was out you know the

695
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,820
air was just it was one of those days

696
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:02,398
where the air was crisp and it was the

697
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:04,619
temperature was perfect you know I'm

698
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,719
cranking away on this 10-speed bike and

699
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,639
the wind is blowing in my face and all

700
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,278
of a sudden I kind of noticed that the

701
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,860
the air and the light and everything is

702
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,380
just kind of alive and the the feeling

703
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,959
of the the wind and the air circulating

704
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,240
around me and in my face and everything

705
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,038
just became

706
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,440
um you know it was like it was like I

707
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,319
was connected with everything around me

708
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,038
and it was a just a wonderful experience

709
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:34,859
and you know I get I get home

710
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,778
and I put on uh I put on some music

711
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,759
because I'm really cranking at this

712
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:42,960

727
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,798
own Bicycle Day

728
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,840
uh because that's what happened to

729
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,158
Albert Hoffman when he first took lsds

730
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,439
he didn't know it was gonna work yeah

731
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,299
and he got on a bike and started going

732
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,278
around and all of a sudden colors and

733
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,740
wind and he's like what's going on I'm

734
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:37,579
starting to feel something unusual

735
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,579
and yeah

736
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:43,159
wow I had no idea man that's uh that was

737
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:45,240
awesome

738
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,419
celebrated today they call it bicycle

739
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,038
day uh because he took acid accidentally

740
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,720
and then he hopped in his bike and he

741
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,859
and he started drop you know riding

742
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,360
around and all of a sudden things

743
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:56,398
started altering on him and he really

744
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,359
wasn't sure what was happening he

745
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,579
thought it was the most beautiful

746
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,898
experience he'd ever had and wanted to

747
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:02,278
give it to everyone it was kind of

748
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:04,259
similar to what you just said it was

749
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,898
that's what made me think of the colors

750
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:09,240
and the wind and you were very in tune

751
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:10,859
with nature and like you're riding your

752
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,220
bike it just kind of triggered that for

753
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:16,079
me of uh yes of your your headspace

754
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,819
changed and all of a sudden the world

755
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:24,359
was born anew it was yeah that's amazing

756
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:27,240
um what I mean to share that experience

757
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:30,479
or or similar right with uh

758
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,038
with such a famous man pretty cool it's

759
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,778
a great story dude

760
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:37,558
um so you know I mean that was that was

761
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:40,019
the first time getting high and um as

762
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:42,298
soon as I came down you know and Mom and

763
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:44,759
Dad came home from work and I'm like God

764
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:46,379
can they tell you know of course yeah

765
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,599
and dinner's prepared and everything

766
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,760
it's you know and it's starting to

767
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,798
reflect on what's

768
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,079
you know what's what's happened to me

769
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,980
and I realized that you know the last

770
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:01,740
seven years of my life that I've been

771
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,919
told these things in school about drugs

772
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,839
are bad you know they're they're evil

773
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,000
and they'll make you want to jump off of

774
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,879
a building because you think you can fly

775
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,058
or you'll be violent or you know you'll

776
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,940
immediately be addicted and fiending for

777
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:19,859
more and you know I mean it was just all

778
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,679
of a sudden I just started questioning

779
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:25,740
everything I'd ever been told by the by

780
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,620
the authorities you know

781
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,558
um because they lied about this and if

782
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:33,778
they lied about that what else did they

783
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:34,500
lie about you know

784
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:37,440
um

785
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:41,159
so you know almost as every every bag of

786
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,899
weed that that I got after that and

787
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,960
there were many right because that was

788
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:48,418
the beginning and and uh of course and

789
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,000
you know I've never never been the same

790
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:53,538
but every bag came with seeds back then

791
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,538
yeah

792
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,480
that's right you know two fingers

793
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:59,480
yeah yeah

794
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:07,140
two fingers for a quarter one finger for

795
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,720
a dime bag you know half ounces it's

796
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,519
just you know simple math but there were

797
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,039
plenty of seeds in it and you know where

798
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,800
I lived um you know in the Southeast it

799
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:20,279
was mostly Colombian that we saw I know

800
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,260
I know magic you know they got lots of

801
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,139
Mexican out there and he was very close

802
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:29,040
to to where it came from and everything

803
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:31,139
but for us you know buying kids buying

804
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,940
weed on the street it was it was

805
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,220
commercial Colombian most of the time

806
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,019
and you know it was just loaded with

807
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:42,239
seeds so

808
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:45,838
um the the very next year in uh 79 I I

809
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:48,000
tried to grow my first garden and uh

810
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,858
you know I had a tray full of sprouts

811
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,838
I've been gardening with my mom ever

812
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:53,239
since I was a little kid you know in the

813
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:57,358
vegetable garden

814
00:34:53,239 --> 00:35:00,118
tomatoes and cucumbers and watermelons

815
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,639
and you name it right but growing uh

816
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,740
growing weed was just another Garden

817
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,920
thing for me and

818
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:10,019
um so I got them to sprout I think I

819
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,300
might even use the paper towel method

820
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:14,579
you know I mean

821
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,019
um because after I started smoking and I

822
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,440
immediately discovered High Times

823
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:21,059
magazine and it became a monthly ritual

824
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,579
of going down to the bookstore and

825
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,460
picking it up and that was at the the

826
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:29,519
beginning of High Times yeah

827
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:32,159
76 77 75 uh yeah so it had been around

828
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,300
for a few years I mean except for the

829
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,059
first year

830
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,400
there you go yeah

831
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,500
um and uh but you know I took those

832
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,019
sprouts and I put them out in the in the

833
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,880
bright full sunlight you know that I

834
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,980
started them indoors under a little

835
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,019
fluorescent light and I and I put them

836
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,699
with no hardening at all under the sun

837
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,400
and I went out the next day and they

838
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:56,719
were all dead and that was the end of

839
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,519
you know year one

840
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,259
total failure you know

841
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,139
um the next year I came back and I hit

842
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,880
it pretty hard and uh me and me and a

843
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:07,379
couple of friends of mine how are your

844
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,838
parents with this

845
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,500
you know that's a great question

846
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,099
um just amazingly open-minded about it

847
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,880
um

848
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,880
you know

849
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:24,000
um it's at one point maybe it was 81 I

850
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,300
think I started I started breeding I had

851
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,599
picked up uh Rob Clark's

852
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,820
um marijuana botany marijuana botany and

853
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,220
it was just so inspiring you know I mean

854
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:39,720
it it really everything just clicked as

855
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:41,939
far as the science of breeding and and

856
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:45,480
um the way that he described you know

857
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,240
genetics and and selection and creating

858
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,400
hybrids and everything it all it was all

859
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,858
so intuitive to me it all just made a

860
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,260
complete and total sense so I

861
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,400
immediately wanted to make my own seeds

862
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,099
and

863
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,180
start breeding and uh you know that

864
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,119
meant

865
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:05,460
of course you know we we wanted smoke

866
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,440
too so I we needed to segregate the

867
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:15,059
males and I wound up bringing these male

868
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:17,400
uh Indica plants into my parents house

869
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,460
um you know I mean I had these things in

870
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,380
the dining room in the window

871
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,900
um just stinking you know I don't know

872
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,559
how I don't know how they put up with it

873
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,380
so my my mom's gone now so I can't I

874
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,019
can't again after that yeah I I have a

875
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,599
question for you so it sounds like

876
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,980
um you know obviously he's you know he's

877
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,260
messing with oaxacan and different

878
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,659
things from Mexico

879
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,760
you know Arizona and New Mexico and that

880
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:46,618
are not that much different climate but

881
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,119
if you're in the southeast of the United

882
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,700
States and you're getting mostly

883
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,619
Colombian when you that second year

884
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:54,960
where you didn't kill your seedlings and

885
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,820
you got a lot farther down the path did

886
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,039
you hit a point where you were like are

887
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,859
these ever gonna finish

888
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:05,880
that's a great question so um you know

889
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:08,699
that second year uh we had a neighbor

890
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,880
across the street had pulled in a

891
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:13,980
harvest in 79

892
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,760
um one of one of the one of his friends

893
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:22,260
had gone to Maui for Christmas

894
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:26,339
and had come back with seeds of what I

895
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:30,420
know now was Maui Wowie in 79.

896
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:33,659
um and he grew they grew a big patch of

897
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,820
that stuff uh and it was it was wide

898
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:39,179
Leaf it was you know I know today that

899
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,000
it was uh it was Mexican and and some

900
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:44,279
sort of Indica hybrid

901
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,880
um you know it finished early it had

902
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,280
amazing taste and um being a poor kid

903
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,800
that cut lawns for money

904
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,380
um luckily half of their crop was seeded

905
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,980
and they sold me the seeded stuff for

906
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:02,160
cheap because nobody wanted it yeah so

907
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,619
back then nobody wanted seeded weed well

908
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,838
you know I mean everything was seated

909
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:09,480
you know sure when you when half your

910
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:12,000
crop is is seedless and they made

911
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,280
t-shirts you know that said sins and

912
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,139
they were they were so you know yeah

913
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,060
yeah yeah they were I'd love to see some

914
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:20,578
of those today I I you know I'm such a

915
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:22,440
nerd for all the old vintage [ __ ] if

916
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,060
you've ever seen one let me know you

917
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,460
know it's it's amazing you know kids

918
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:28,679
immediately turn into you know these

919
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,800
instant entrepreneurs when they wind up

920
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:34,019
with with you know a bedroom full of

921
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,780
weed hanging from the ceiling that's for

922
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:39,119
sure you know it's just all of a sudden

923
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,220
you know it turns into well all my

924
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,160
friends are gonna want this so how much

925
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:46,618
am I going to charge for it yep and uh

926
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,659
you know you got lucky in the sense that

927
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,640
you got a hybrid that would actually

928
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:54,239
finish in your area

929
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:57,179
yeah because yeah I always had this idea

930
00:39:54,239 --> 00:40:01,559
and I'm I'm obviously like in 19 when

931
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:03,899
you guys are speaking of 1975 77 78 uh I

932
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,779
was still happily in diapers uh so

933
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,519
that's definitely not my my part but I

934
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,859
always thought that like maybe the first

935
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,380
American breeding was you're getting

936
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:15,239
this import from Thailand and Colombia

937
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,220
and Panama and all that and you're like

938
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,039
well how the hell do I get this to

939
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,659
finish where I'm at

940
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,639
take this Mexican and I can shorten it

941
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:26,578
up some because this Mexican seems to be

942
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,618
quicker but yeah exactly right yeah this

943
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:30,599
tie in this Colombian is taking a

944
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,160
million years and it's getting cold and

945
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,800
it's getting rainy and my stuff doesn't

946
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:38,399
even look like it's done yeah so I mean

947
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,619
that that Maui was was only part of the

948
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,740
crop that we did that year you know it

949
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:47,160
was um we we also had a Mexican and we

950
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:51,000
had we had a couple of Colombians

951
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:54,239
um you know it was and all my friends

952
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,119
were growing at that point right so you

953
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,919
know uh everybody had a couple of plants

954
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,079
out in the woods and we'd go to a party

955
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,059
on Friday night somebody's parents were

956
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,099
out of town and sometimes they'd walk

957
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:06,779
you out behind the house and you know

958
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,780
into the woods behind their house and

959
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,599
there'd be a little six foot Colombian

960
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,640
um Christmas tree in a in an opening in

961
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,980
in the woods behind their house you know

962
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,799
just a just a little hole in the canopy

963
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,900
where the sun came in and

964
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,579
um yeah so those Colombians you know

965
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,920
they would they would

966
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,140
we didn't we never really finished them

967
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,720
as as we know you know what you know

968
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,699
resin glands and yeah proper finish

969
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,679
probably they weren't they were never

970
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,618
really properly finished but they were

971
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:40,440
finished well enough that you know um we

972
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:42,480
we could get into the end of November

973
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,579
and sometimes even just you know first

974
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,000
couple weeks of December where I lived

975
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:50,700
uh before before the frost would that's

976
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,280
very helpful yeah and the hardest part

977
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:55,439
is actually you know not picking it

978
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,200
early kids didn't know any better and we

979
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,000
just wanted to smoke the stuff so

980
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,699
um you know I mean we were just going

981
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,380
off of the the weather reports and the

982
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:07,199
newspaper and

983
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,900
sure you know Farmers Almanac [ __ ]

984
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,460
so maybe maybe I could ask a question of

985
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,019
both of you

986
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,480
um these first couple of years that you

987
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:17,820
guys are both describing what were the

988
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,440
what were the the Aromas what were the

989
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,359
scents what were the terpenes you know

990
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,039
no one's no one used terpenes back then

991
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,078
but like what were the what did the

992
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,880
weeds smell like to you

993
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,680
you know that it just smell like we did

994
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,599
you did you get Citrus did you get any

995
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,879
kind of skunk did you get did you smell

996
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,338
like weed you know if you can remember

997
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,460
what Aromas were you getting off these

998
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:40,460
original Mexicans and and Colombians and

999
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,079
these and these or even uh

1000
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,820
1979 skunk one what would that smell

1001
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,980
like well yeah we were gonna get there

1002
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,900
but I was just curious as like what what

1003
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,300
did oaxacan smell like

1004
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,579
you know like did it because you know we

1005
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,260
know we know these lines from like way

1006
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:57,420
later when they've been worked by people

1007
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,099
extensively and bred in different

1008
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,318
directions and it sounds like you guys

1009
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:04,440
were getting it basically from the

1010
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:06,480
farmer the source and this yeah from

1011
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,639
unadulterated from the farmer and the

1012
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,639
source actual like what we would call

1013
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:15,659
land race today I suppose right do you

1014
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:17,879
want to go first uh magic or

1015
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,639
um sure well

1016
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,940
the very first

1017
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,920
I'll just I have a little start up here

1018
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,500
the first two joints I bought were in

1019
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,539
1966 from the only hippie in my high

1020
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,420
school and

1021
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:34,980
um I I wasn't quite ready to smoke them

1022
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,358
so I put them in a bottle and buried

1023
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,818
them in my yard

1024
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:41,639
and two years later when I dug them up

1025
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:45,179
and thought I'll try them they were just

1026
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:46,858
mold pure mold so that didn't work but

1027
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,739
they had

1028
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:52,199
you know your really earliest weed that

1029
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:54,419
I remember smelling from my friend in

1030
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,039
well when I went to

1031
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,180
yeah

1032
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:02,900
um

1033
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:07,919
pine pine terpenes really stood out in

1034
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:09,780
1975 or 76 some Growers weed from Santa

1035
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,720
Barbara was showing up in the Verde

1036
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,599
Valley in Sedona Cottonwood Jerome area

1037
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,939
and probably coming through Phoenix and

1038
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,640
it smelled just like fresh pine I've

1039
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,099
never smelled weed like it again since

1040
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,078
then it if you close your eyes and just

1041
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,838
held it up you would think you were you

1042
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,300
had Pine salt in your in front of you

1043
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:33,318
and like a Christmas tree style or pine

1044
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,318
salt what'd you say

1045
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:39,239
um more of a Christmas tree style yeah

1046
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,760
natural Pine yeah yeah and it was it was

1047
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,759
beautiful stuff it was sensimilla it it

1048
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,819
was strong and it was very inspiring

1049
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,619
because when we smelled that tide wheat

1050
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:52,679
though Thai stick had a total different

1051
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,400
scent it was heavy and earthy

1052
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,960
um

1053
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,920
I remember seeing early Thai sticks in

1054
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,960
1970s 71 that were

1055
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,079
supposedly dipped in the Opium too or

1056
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,720
opium yeah the pasta water yeah they had

1057
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,760
white on the outside

1058
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:14,459
we sat down with some black hash ones

1059
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,339
that was opiated supposedly but little

1060
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:20,579
black white specks to it and we cut out

1061
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:23,338
with the razor blades every white Speck

1062
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,859
so we could have been mold huh

1063
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:28,619
so we could have enough to take a hit

1064
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:31,019
and it wasn't opium I don't know what it

1065
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:33,480
was it didn't get us any higher but it

1066
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:36,000
made the costs go up when people were

1067
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,119
buying it they paid more for it I've

1068
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,380
I've looked a lot into that situation uh

1069
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,480
especially when researching chocolate

1070
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,920
Thai because a lot of that theory behind

1071
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,719
chocolate Thai was that it was dipped in

1072
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,960
something called Pasha water or pasta

1073
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:51,000
water which was the the water that was

1074
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,679
left over from producing heroin it had

1075
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,599
the alkaloids the morphine alkaloids and

1076
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:56,159
stuff in it and supposedly the story was

1077
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,318
that they would dip it in that but

1078
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,879
there's not really any proof of any of

1079
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,679
this ever existing anywhere but that was

1080
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,180
the theory behind it and where we're

1081
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,500
kind of all stemmed from it may have

1082
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,419
happened once or twice but I don't know

1083
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,219
if it ever really got out there but I've

1084
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,079
heard about people being charged massive

1085
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:11,219
amounts of prices for these Thai sticks

1086
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,359
that were supposedly dipped in this

1087
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:15,539
water

1088
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:18,900
yeah there's been long long debates

1089
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:20,759
about that online but yeah you know it's

1090
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,559
uh I think it's been pretty much

1091
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,599
debunked mostly because the people

1092
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,838
growing the two different crops weren't

1093
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,160
really the same people and and a lot of

1094
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,940
them weren't producing heroin they were

1095
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:35,699
just Farmers right like not like before

1096
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,980
we lose track what was the smells that

1097
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:39,358
you were getting off uh off your uh

1098
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,219
Hawaiian hybrids that you were

1099
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,098
successful with that second year

1100
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:46,379
right so I mean you know the the Mexican

1101
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:49,380
versus Colombian

1102
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,000
um you know pretty pretty distinctive I

1103
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,380
usually associate

1104
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,880
uh Cedar tastes and kind of a kind of a

1105
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,358
citrus

1106
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,880
um Citrus Pioneer cedery taste with with

1107
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:05,818
Mexican and I grew some beautiful

1108
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,740
walking a couple of times that you know

1109
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:11,099
it flowered so much faster than the

1110
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:14,459
Colombian that I actually let it go too

1111
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:17,338
long to the point where it was it was

1112
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,260
actually over mature and I I it had lost

1113
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:22,639
some of its potency

1114
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:25,260
um but but that was contrasted with the

1115
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,239
Colombians which were

1116
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,160
um you know usually we'd get a lot of

1117
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:31,019
purple

1118
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:33,659
because we they'd be coming in so late

1119
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:35,460
that just the temperature change would

1120
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,920
would bring out a lot of Purple colors

1121
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,380
and then you know once something turns

1122
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,079
purple that um

1123
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,119
what's that what's that uh it's not

1124
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,640
chlorophyll what's the other signings

1125
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,680
yeah the anthocyanins really seem to

1126
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:51,838
affect the taste and oh yeah you always

1127
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,838
do affects the taste and smell but that

1128
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:58,440
yeah and uh and personally I like it

1129
00:47:54,838 --> 00:48:01,380
right I do too purple fiend yeah but um

1130
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:04,139
you know like like magic said the uh you

1131
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,180
know the pine was was there in in the

1132
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:08,519
Colombian and

1133
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:10,618
um there's a you know difference between

1134
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,940
the smell and The Taste when you smoke

1135
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,660
it

1136
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,639
um there's um

1137
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:20,578
yep there is there's some of it has kind

1138
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:22,259
of a chocolatey I I mean you know I

1139
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:25,800
don't want to completely Sidetrack

1140
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,680
things into a haze talk but you know my

1141
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,318
my belief is when I when I started

1142
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:34,139
growing oh Haze

1143
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,779
um you know a few years ago I found that

1144
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:38,699
the effects one day I just realized that

1145
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,240
the effects that I got from smoking oh

1146
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:45,960
Haze and even the tastes were exactly

1147
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:49,199
the same as what I felt that first time

1148
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:53,338
I got high riding that bicycle home

1149
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:56,399
you know yeah the Colombian and you know

1150
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:58,619
that you know it really kind of messed

1151
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,780
with my head a little bit because for so

1152
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,059
long people talked about Haze as the

1153
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:07,500
mixture of you know four different kinds

1154
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:10,199
of of sativity Mexican Colombian Thai

1155
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:13,800
and and Indian right yeah yeah

1156
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:16,578
um and you know trying to figure out how

1157
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:20,099
this what what is obviously a you know

1158
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:23,640
Sam's the ohaze as it's been released to

1159
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:24,740
the world since since uh Sam brought it

1160
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:28,858
to

1161
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:32,098
Amsterdam yeah um you know is not

1162
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:34,858
everything that they that they made when

1163
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:37,380
the poster was made right and the

1164
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:39,420
pedigree was described it's that's what

1165
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,000
Sam brought with him that's what Sam

1166
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:45,838
preserved that's what Sam shared a

1167
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,300
three-way Colombian hybrid right not the

1168
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:49,920
Indian not the Thai not not the Mexican

1169
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,359
and

1170
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,420
um the tastes are there you know there's

1171
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,400
kind of a chocolatey taste to it

1172
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,980
um you know earthy you could call it

1173
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,960
there's Piney

1174
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,059
um you can find some sweetness in there

1175
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,039
some Citrus there's different phenos in

1176
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:07,019
there but it's all coming from Colombia

1177
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,119
as far as I'm concerned and you know we

1178
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:10,559
can have a debate and I'll I'll let

1179
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,960
anybody believe what they want to

1180
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,719
believe but I I genuinely think like

1181
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,720
right now uh there is a man with a

1182
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:20,338
letter D for a name that is just smiling

1183
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,019
ear to ear when it when enables old

1184
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:24,420
partners and it's been talking to me in

1185
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:27,000
not so a bunch specifically about Sam's

1186
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:30,180
oh hey days being so Colombian dominant

1187
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,880
being so Colombian dominant and the the

1188
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:35,219
69 Hayes was it that Neville had gotten

1189
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,019
the first time was very much more like

1190
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:38,279
Southeast Asian dominant and that was

1191
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:41,579
the main difference between the Hayes

1192
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,260
Neville was using and why Neville cities

1193
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:45,180
became so popular and why a lot of the

1194
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,940
ohays supposedly that's one of the

1195
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:50,639
theories why ohays didn't come as as

1196
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,280
much as it had promised yeah it reminded

1197
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,779
me of something actually because uh it

1198
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,240
had been mentioned

1199
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,400
um earlier on on the thing is that when

1200
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:02,459
you know Thai and stuff like that was a

1201
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:06,420
little bit broader leafed right

1202
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,858
um and you know he made a point that you

1203
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,780
know Sam and those guys you know they

1204
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:10,858
kept reading towards the thin Leaf

1205
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,180
because they thought that was more

1206
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:13,920
sativa

1207
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:16,440
um but that was actually more Colombian

1208
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,599
sativa and that some of the Southeast

1209
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,280
Asian stuff and some of the ties it's

1210
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,400
not like they were fat weaved but they

1211
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,500
were broader leafed than

1212
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,079
um pure Colombian ones

1213
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:31,260
yeah I've got a picture of a tie I grew

1214
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:34,380
in 81 it was it was uh Thai stick from

1215
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,579
1980 that A friend brought home from

1216
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,920
college

1217
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:41,220
um older brother of one of my partners

1218
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:45,000
brought home from college and and uh in

1219
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:46,618
Colorado and it's very thin leaf and I I

1220
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,639
know that you know people talk about

1221
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:54,900
with Ty the alligator tail leaves right

1222
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:58,078
Broad Leaf extreme serrations

1223
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,420
um and it's you know it's uh it has a

1224
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,119
reputation for that but that was you

1225
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,980
know it's a it's a big country and um

1226
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,680
you know we all know from growing that

1227
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,838
man you can't even pack uh pop a 10 pack

1228
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,639
of seeds without seeing you know a

1229
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,380
couple of narrow Leafs in there with the

1230
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:15,118
wide leaves so why should we think that

1231
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,920
an entire country is going to produce

1232
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,160
nothing but the same thing of course

1233
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:22,318
micro climates everywhere yeah yeah for

1234
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,058
um for like Matt and myself

1235
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,440
um you know when I was first started

1236
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:28,200
smoking the only real two kinds of

1237
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,700
import I ever saw was brown Mexican and

1238
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:32,879
green Mexican

1239
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:35,338
I came up a little later the Thai the

1240
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,140
Colombian the you know the Panamanian

1241
00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:39,599
all some of these different Regional

1242
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:41,338
things you know the the shift towards

1243
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,980
all those groups mostly importing

1244
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:46,139
cocaine had already happened so a lot of

1245
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:49,019
the diversity and imports had changed

1246
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:51,058
and there was still a bunch of Mexican

1247
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:54,239
um but that's kind of all it was for us

1248
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:56,460
yeah same experience for me even a

1249
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,439
decade coming in a decade I think after

1250
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,440
Naza where I was starting it was the

1251
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,480
same we had Mexican was it

1252
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,579
you know talking about these Mexicans

1253
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,559
I'm thinking about mad Jag's experience

1254
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,119
with that stuff and and I I don't want

1255
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,559
to can we just stick a pin in that I

1256
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,160
want to make one more point about the

1257
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,740
haze and the co the Colombian um the the

1258
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,118
Colombian roots of it as we know it

1259
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:21,358
today for

1260
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:23,880
um that you know Colombia just like

1261
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,558
we're just discussing Thailand is is you

1262
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,619
know obviously going to have a diverse

1263
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,720
range of different uh different

1264
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:33,900
chemotype phenotypes whatever

1265
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:37,980
um but but you know in Colombia you had

1266
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:43,079
Reds and and Golds and and green and and

1267
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:46,019
you know black black yeah I mean so many

1268
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,480
different types and and uh they all had

1269
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:51,420
such distinctive flavors and tastes and

1270
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,460
effects um you know I was lucky you know

1271
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:57,180
when I started doing this stuff it was

1272
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,579
it was the end of the Gory days of those

1273
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:03,058
Elite

1274
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:07,380
um those Elite types of of weed I got to

1275
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:10,920
smoke the Panama Colombian red

1276
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:15,358
um I I got to smoke real Santa Mara gold

1277
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:18,119
and um you know they all have things in

1278
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:20,400
common but but they were some unique

1279
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,220
characteristics about them that just you

1280
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,280
know Vive La difference you know just uh

1281
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:28,679
yeah big big big fan of uh are The

1282
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,380
Connoisseur and High Times magazine and

1283
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:34,199
he uh he inspired me to become a

1284
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,539
connoisseur of life and and appreciate

1285
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:39,118
all the differences between things and

1286
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:41,880
Savor them and I want to point this out

1287
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,800
just because I I just even a recent

1288
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,380
episode I I made a statement that I

1289
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,880
thought R was Robert Clark because

1290
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,039
that's kind of what people have been

1291
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,559
saying forever or it's assumed but I

1292
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:55,380
think that might be wrong Maybe

1293
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,819
totally wrong totally wrong so yeah

1294
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,380
that's that's an important note to make

1295
00:54:56,818 --> 00:55:00,000
because I have always Associated

1296
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,920
everything Robert Clark's ever written

1297
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,300
with Arthur connoisseur and I love

1298
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,740
Arthur connoisseur and I love Robert

1299
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,900
Clark too but I've always Associated

1300
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:11,459
them as the same person and and they're

1301
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,900
not no I asked Rob himself because yeah

1302
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,619
long ago

1303
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,500
um

1304
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:20,039
I wondered the same question and he said

1305
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,900
no and I I've actually heard r's real

1306
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:25,920
name and I can't remember it right now

1307
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:28,800
but someone I know from Manhattan knows

1308
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,539
him and and said oh no that's a

1309
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,500
different guy I wonder if he's still

1310
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:34,619
with us

1311
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,358
I don't know ah man you'd be a great one

1312
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,800
to interview one thing I'm curious about

1313
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:39,420
and I don't want to there's so many

1314
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,000
threads that happen in these kind of

1315
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,559
convos you could lose it at but

1316
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,719
um when you were describing how

1317
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:47,400
difficult it was to get to your Canyon

1318
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,919
grows

1319
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,420
um having done some gorilla myself and

1320
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,338
and hidden

1321
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,260
um obviously like growing it is one

1322
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:56,519
thing but then harvesting it and drying

1323
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,559
it and getting it out of there is

1324
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,199
another thing could you talk for a

1325
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,940
minute about what that was like if

1326
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,098
you're going down some Goat Trail

1327
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:08,039
through the rocks and all of a sudden

1328
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:09,960
you have several hundred pounds that

1329
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,358
would be Dr you know that I mean more

1330
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,519
like a thousand pounds when it's wet you

1331
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:17,098
know did you try to dry it there in the

1332
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,539
bushes did you hike it all out one by

1333
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,338
one

1334
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:24,300
um how much effort went into that

1335
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:26,039
because I that's a real struggle

1336
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:29,280
we

1337
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:33,779
once we started growing in our own

1338
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,880
Canyon in Magic Canyon we did everything

1339
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,040
um except for that first year where you

1340
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,019
had the photo of my friend down next to

1341
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:42,599
the water but the subsequent two years

1342
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:46,259
with my partner from the UK

1343
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,940
and we had a Swiss helper too who I'm

1344
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,540
still good friends with I saw him three

1345
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:54,300
years ago in Zurich he we did everything

1346
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:56,940
down there we manicured it we dried it

1347
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,519
manicured it boxed it we we bought

1348
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:02,579
knocked down boxes from A supplier in

1349
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:04,639
Phoenix that were roughly I'd say about

1350
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:07,920
well

1351
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:11,759
for 12 inches by eight inches by six

1352
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,280
inches and that held a pound

1353
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,700
so that's perfect what we did we we

1354
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:20,400
brought Kelty pack frames that were just

1355
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:24,058
bare frames without the uh Associated

1356
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,700
baggage on them and bungee cords and we

1357
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:28,880
could stack five of these boxes on one

1358
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:32,279
Kelty so you could carry out five pounds

1359
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:35,579
oh wow every every bit was hiked out

1360
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:38,819
that way up this 1600 foot wash of

1361
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:40,920
Boulders and strewn and we had pruned a

1362
00:57:38,818 --> 00:57:43,500
few branches here and there where you

1363
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,139
just had to have clearance to get under

1364
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,420
a pine tree or something

1365
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:52,199
and we were very fortunate because

1366
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,940
are one of the people in my life who's

1367
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,279
still around he was one of the two

1368
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,880
principles of peyote that I've written

1369
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,500
about he also is a huge weed dealer and

1370
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,019
he would meet us at the edge of our

1371
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:07,199
Canyon after sunset

1372
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:09,719
and we would just hike up hanum however

1373
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:12,539
many boxes we brought up and he'd hand

1374
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,399
us a paper bag full of cash and we

1375
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:16,039
didn't have to even drive to Phoenix or

1376
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,440
take them with

1377
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:21,599
trying to take it back home because that

1378
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,000
was actually the thought of working that

1379
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,760
hard for a year and then losing it all

1380
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,358
because you got a traffic stop that was

1381
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,640
really influenced us so

1382
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:35,699
we got a hundred dollars an ounce

1383
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:38,699
sixteen hundred a pound and

1384
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:41,159
that was the standard price and yeah he

1385
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:44,098
sold it all by grams

1386
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:46,318
smart man he's so he sold it for ten

1387
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:49,140
dollars a gram to college students at

1388
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:52,380
ASU he lived two blocks away from from

1389
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:55,618
ASU in Tennessee he just would buy

1390
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:58,559
everything we had and just slowly sell

1391
00:58:55,619 --> 00:59:01,140
it over a year or two and triple his

1392
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,119
money so you had a you had a you had a

1393
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:04,318
uh you had one or two friends that were

1394
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,318
helping you

1395
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:09,179
right so when it comes to hiking it out

1396
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:11,639
if you could bring about five pounds at

1397
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:15,058
a time that means each trip you're

1398
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:19,078
probably at a maximum of 10 or 15 pounds

1399
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:21,240
yep um yeah so at Harvard we brought in

1400
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,980
six more people at Harvest Time okay

1401
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:24,659
that makes more sense yeah I was gonna

1402
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:27,480
say I was like man you were really fit

1403
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:30,058
uh yeah your your legs your hiking

1404
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,318
ability was intense because it's a lot

1405
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:35,700
of back and forth

1406
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:38,880
yeah well that part I mean I've

1407
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:42,000
I've hiked down gasoline you know five

1408
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:45,358
gallons of gas is like 35 pounds and

1409
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,519
yeah garbage bags and it would still

1410
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:48,960
stink it was amazing because shaking it

1411
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,539
and moving down

1412
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,358
it was so difficult to keep it not from

1413
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:57,779
saturating everything but at Harvest

1414
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:59,460
Time boyfriends and girlfriends of ours

1415
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,220
and others

1416
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:03,318
um at most we had eight people down

1417
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:05,159
there

1418
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:06,599
manicuring

1419
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:09,779
um we

1420
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:12,720
we set up a 10 by 10 foot Coleman

1421
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,000
classic tents that were spray painted

1422
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,039
so they were a light brown color but we

1423
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,500
sprayed them with a little darkness and

1424
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:23,159
green and they Blended in very nicely

1425
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:25,858
and we limbed the plants

1426
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:27,779
we we cut

1427
01:00:25,858 --> 01:00:29,880
we cut a whole plan if we could if it

1428
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,640
wasn't too big we'd hang it

1429
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:36,298
for a day or two and then we'd cut the

1430
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,879
branches off lemon and stacked them like

1431
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:41,099
like that all the way up inside these

1432
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,980
tents so in case it did rain we weren't

1433
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:45,920
going to get caught in you know there

1434
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,798
yeah you know

1435
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:52,798
did you do a lot of sun drying

1436
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:56,099
no it was all and I know

1437
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:58,199
we hung Roots between trees and just

1438
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:01,200
hung them in there and it was still in

1439
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:03,659
the 90s or 80s in the day at night it

1440
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:06,960
would drop up where we were growing we

1441
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:08,639
were growing at about 4 500 feet so it

1442
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,980
at night it would cool down but in the

1443
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:14,519
day this you know it was really nice

1444
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:16,920
plus we were growing in our main Garden

1445
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:19,739
was in an east west

1446
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,619
situation so that the sun when it came

1447
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:25,919
up it hit very early and it went almost

1448
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:29,460
to the end of of the night because it

1449
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,960
did drop below the uh Canyon Edge at

1450
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,940
each end but

1451
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,338
one of our Gardens was in the north

1452
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,798
south section and it only got seven

1453
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:40,920
hours or eight hours of direct sunlight

1454
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:43,259
at Max yeah and still the plants grew

1455
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,579
perfectly and beautifully it didn't make

1456
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,099
a difference

1457
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:51,420
um but the east west

1458
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:54,920
Gardens you know they got 10 11 hours of

1459
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:58,380
direct sunlight were awesome yeah they

1460
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:01,380
grew much bigger plants much taller

1461
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:03,539
for what uh when did when did the

1462
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,000
Mexicans naturally finish like when was

1463
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:07,739
your Harvest Time when when were they

1464
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,239
ripe those first few years for you

1465
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:13,679
October

1466
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:16,558
October yeah the Colombian you passed a

1467
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,480
photo by their earlier

1468
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,680
that was the

1469
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,900
it was

1470
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:26,639
um it was snowing on the rim above us on

1471
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:30,139
Thanksgiving

1472
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,460
and that's our tent one of them yeah

1473
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:34,500
there it is

1474
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,838
right in there

1475
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,940
well hidden that was a that was the

1476
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:40,139
north south Garden we called the Anasazi

1477
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,798
there's the Hall of the Mountain King

1478
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:46,980
you cannot you know that kept hikers out

1479
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:49,259
yeah anyway the Colombian the Colombian

1480
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,119
we didn't know about these things about

1481
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,960
finishing and how long they would take

1482
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:57,240
and it was crazy because it was they

1483
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,220
were the size of my little fingertip you

1484
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:02,279
know the buds and yeah it was

1485
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:04,679
Thanksgiving and snowing above us

1486
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,760
so we didn't grow any more Colombian

1487
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:07,759
after that first year

1488
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:16,200
I think was it by R anyway there's this

1489
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,900
famous there's this famous

1490
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:20,818
um list of seeds that's been attributed

1491
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,858
to Sam or it's been attributed to others

1492
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:24,659
or whatever and it had a bunch of you

1493
01:03:22,858 --> 01:03:25,798
know hazes and skunks and different

1494
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:27,298
things like that but what was

1495
01:03:25,798 --> 01:03:30,539
interesting about it

1496
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:31,440
is it was organized by month that it

1497
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:33,298
finished

1498
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,280
and there was only three or four things

1499
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:37,019
that finished in October there was

1500
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,240
probably 10 things that finished in

1501
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:41,759
November and then there was like 25

1502
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:45,058
things that were December or January

1503
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:48,059
which is like a polar opposite of today

1504
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:49,559
um yeah well Rob was growing in Ben

1505
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:52,019
Lomond

1506
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:55,079
um just above Santa Cruz in the Redwoods

1507
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:58,318
there and he you know the the

1508
01:03:55,079 --> 01:04:01,640
temperatures were very Mediterraneans in

1509
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:01,639
a sense you know yeah

1510
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:07,098
um back I wanted to jump forward to a

1511
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:10,500
question when you were talking about

1512
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:12,119
Mendocino and up north did you ever do

1513
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:15,119
you know where Redway is

1514
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:15,119
yes

1515
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:24,298
because I met my Colombian friend in in

1516
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:27,599
future partner in many escapades at the

1517
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:31,440
country Tavern there in 1972.

1518
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:32,880
oh wow a guy a guy from Scottsdale owned

1519
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,119
the country Tavern

1520
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,039
and he also had his own chemist and he

1521
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:39,740
produced millions and millions of hits

1522
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:42,900
of acid

1523
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:45,000
that's amazing good when we went into

1524
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:47,940
that Tavern the first time

1525
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,059
half the people were tripping and it was

1526
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:53,760
just wow it was like clean scene but my

1527
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:55,440
Colombian friend who I just met there he

1528
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,720
took me on a hike down towards Shelter

1529
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,059
Cove Shelter Cove was was just five

1530
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:02,399
houses then that were abandoned because

1531
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:05,760
it was a someone tried to do a

1532
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,980
subdivision there and it didn't work so

1533
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,660
as we hiked down we went off into the

1534
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,420
woods because he knew about a few plants

1535
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:15,480
and I saw my first plants over there

1536
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,519
that were growing they were individual

1537
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,858
holes in between the Redwoods like where

1538
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,900
there was a spot of sun shooting down in

1539
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:24,358
and it was just this beautiful black

1540
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,639
rich soil and their plants were you know

1541
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:28,500
probably six or seven feet tall so I was

1542
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,500
like wow that's cool

1543
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:34,019
but yeah that's my part of the country

1544
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:36,239
I've I moved to Mendocino County in 1998

1545
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:38,400
and I've lived there since so Southern

1546
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,618
humble Humboldt in general Mendocino

1547
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,780
Lake all those areas that's kind of like

1548
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:46,200
my stomping grounds

1549
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,760
um and uh yeah and you know like like

1550
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:49,199
you were saying with LSD or whatever

1551
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,140
else

1552
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:55,259
um you know there was back then it was

1553
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:56,759
remote uh it was mountainous you could

1554
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,280
get you know there wasn't very many

1555
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,980
people uh your worries up there were

1556
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,079
hunters and loggers

1557
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,699
um right but lots of people went up

1558
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,440
there to kind of get away from things

1559
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:09,779
some people grew weeds some people did

1560
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,940
other things but it was that isolation

1561
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,319
and that and that being kind of out in

1562
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,740
the middle of nowhere

1563
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:18,298
Ville that was kind of no idea

1564
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:21,118
I have no idea how this guy from

1565
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:23,519
Scottsdale found Redway but that he

1566
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:26,579
bought the cut the tavern there and he

1567
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:29,699
was living nearby and his chemist was

1568
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:33,180
somewhere nearby out in the woods and

1569
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:35,699
um yeah if it was a interesting place

1570
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:37,379
and that's where my Colombian friend was

1571
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:38,759
Gerardo

1572
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,920
so

1573
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:45,180
he was on a student visa but he

1574
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,500
overstayed an extra eight years

1575
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,460
so

1576
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:51,780
um yeah he he spoke he learned English

1577
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:54,599
simultaneously with Spanish in Colombia

1578
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:57,839
and Cali since he was five years old so

1579
01:06:54,599 --> 01:07:00,480
he spoke such perfect English that

1580
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,920
later in life when we were

1581
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,199
our big

1582
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,720
big bust happen

1583
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:08,960
um he was interviewed by FBI agents he

1584
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:12,480
corrected their spelling twice

1585
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,880
oh wow because they didn't know how to

1586
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,519
spell the words that they were using so

1587
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,260
it was pretty funny yeah and you know

1588
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,719
another thought I had you met you

1589
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:24,240
mentioned uh you know Howard marks's

1590
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:26,098
book Mr Nice and how your friend kind of

1591
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:27,838
blew him out of the water

1592
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:30,599
um I remember a long time ago when I

1593
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:32,699
read his autobiography that he said that

1594
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:34,440
basically his autobiography was full of

1595
01:07:32,699 --> 01:07:36,419
people that had been busted

1596
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,880
and that some of the coolest and biggest

1597
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:40,619
people that he interacted with had never

1598
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,240
got in trouble so therefore you weren't

1599
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:42,960
going to hear anything about them in his

1600
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:45,779
book

1601
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,400
because they had skated through and

1602
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:50,280
nobody knew about them and he wasn't

1603
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,900
about to give any tips or ideas so he

1604
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,819
said his book was essentially a

1605
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,900
collection of people that had gotten in

1606
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:57,480
trouble

1607
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:59,519
and that there was many who didn't and

1608
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,900
they were invisible

1609
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:06,960
well I I can dig it my friend who who

1610
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:10,380
broke his hip and was my our pilot

1611
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,740
friend he um never got busted and he

1612
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:15,720
gave my UK partner the go-ahead that he

1613
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:20,039
would be willing to let him write a book

1614
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:22,198
about him and interview him so

1615
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:23,159
he's excited about that but I said to

1616
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,719
him

1617
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:26,219
um you're gonna have to follow this guy

1618
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,899
because he's all over the world still

1619
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:30,719
you know now he's in the hospital in

1620
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:33,838
Anchorage so you could probably get some

1621
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:37,219
weeks of talk with him but you know he

1622
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:40,439
goes he still goes to Hong Kong and

1623
01:08:37,219 --> 01:08:43,259
Portugal and I mean the guy is

1624
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:46,139
um he's 75 and

1625
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:49,560
he got his pilot's license when he was

1626
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:52,440
15 before he could drive a car and we

1627
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:55,259
figured it out once he stopped keeping a

1628
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:57,960
log book at 10 000 hours and he said

1629
01:08:55,259 --> 01:09:00,960
that most TWA Pilots never hit 10 000

1630
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,000
hours yeah but he literally lives in his

1631
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:06,239
his plane and then when he went to

1632
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,100
Alaska and bought a a gold mine the only

1633
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:11,459
way to get to it was to fly in and out

1634
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,920
so and as you know in Alaska everyone

1635
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:16,198
uses planes like cars you know if they

1636
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:20,039
live way out in the woods

1637
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:23,460
so he he owned the airport once in a

1638
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:25,798
town that I lived in and he's just a

1639
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:28,739
legend but you're right no one really

1640
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:30,479
knew about him just like Mr nice's

1641
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:31,919
Howard Mark's friends

1642
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,858
um because

1643
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:38,039
he got into Afghanistan in the late 60s

1644
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:41,640
he was importing lapis the deep blue

1645
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:44,159
stone yeah highly valued in Europe and

1646
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,739
that led to hashish

1647
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:49,798
and he was just sending home a few

1648
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:51,838
pounds rolled up in Afghani rugs he

1649
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:53,039
would just ship them and they would get

1650
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:55,800
through back then they weren't even

1651
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:59,039
using dogs really to check stuff in the

1652
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:02,219
late 60s or 1970.

1653
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:05,159
then his friends slowly

1654
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:07,020
you know move to Freighters and they

1655
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,819
were sending Freighters but when the

1656
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,640
Soviets took over he couldn't go to

1657
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:14,939
Afghanistan any longer so he moved over

1658
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,940
to Peshawar in Pakistan into Star Wars

1659
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:19,919
now is known as the terrorist capital I

1660
01:10:17,939 --> 01:10:22,019
mean that's where all that for sure oh

1661
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:27,140
the terrorists hang up that [ __ ] before

1662
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:29,280
but he would um he was active over there

1663
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,980
gosh I don't know

1664
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:35,039
I like I said last time I met him in 85

1665
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:38,579
in in um

1666
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:40,079
he had a houseboat in Sausalito and I

1667
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:43,319
met him there and

1668
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:45,960
he was visibly shaking because he was so

1669
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:47,698
excited about the 60-ton barge that they

1670
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,819
were going to pull across the the

1671
01:10:47,698 --> 01:10:55,039
universe which they did more than that's

1672
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:57,539
awesome that is so awesome wow yep

1673
01:10:55,039 --> 01:11:01,140
and they would go to Canada

1674
01:10:57,539 --> 01:11:02,819
Canada had he said they had only like a

1675
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,900
thousand not even a thousand a few

1676
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:10,859
hundred agents in involved in drugs so

1677
01:11:06,899 --> 01:11:13,738
all those West Coast places above Juneau

1678
01:11:10,859 --> 01:11:18,658
in Alaska and that were perfect I mean

1679
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:18,658
in Canada along the coastline yeah

1680
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:24,299
so Canada has much more of a hashish

1681
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:26,579
culture than America did because of that

1682
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:28,560
importing and you know I think not only

1683
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:31,140
that but it was like the penalties if

1684
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:34,679
you got caught in Canada were far less

1685
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:37,860
than the American ones right right now

1686
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:40,980
and once it reached there it would get

1687
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:42,179
him exported over to the U.S

1688
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:43,678
um yeah and

1689
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:45,840
this guy

1690
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,119
he he had a

1691
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:52,199
a passport you pay ten thousand dollars

1692
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:54,059
for from the UK in like 1969 or

1693
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:55,559
something and it was a real passport

1694
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,320
that

1695
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,360
um he was able to have it fixed with his

1696
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:02,698
name on it that's awesome and his photo

1697
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:04,079
and he would he would walk across the

1698
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:06,059
border to Canada

1699
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,579
and then fly from Canada around the

1700
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,679
world as a British citizen

1701
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:12,899
when he was going to Afghanistan and

1702
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:15,480
Pakistan he wasn't an American he was

1703
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:16,979
British so and then he'd fly back to

1704
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:19,559
Canada and walk across the border into

1705
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:22,559
Washington and be and then go back to

1706
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:25,860
his normal life over here man after my

1707
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,960
own heart yeah he also had one of the

1708
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:29,460
first phone scramblers I've ever seen he

1709
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,219
bought it from a company in Amsterdam

1710
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,560
and you held it up to the phone and the

1711
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:36,060
little rubber cups went over each end

1712
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,699
and then you talked to the back of it

1713
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:43,080
and yeah it was used and stuff like that

1714
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:44,879
you know by 1970 1971 very security

1715
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:46,800
conscience fella

1716
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,480
very smart

1717
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:53,940
yep wow that's fascinating so so

1718
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:55,439
I was gonna say I we've we've kind of

1719
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:57,719
wandered off the Mad Jag part but

1720
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:59,158
there's one part that like totally

1721
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:03,359
totally enthralled me with the whole

1722
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:05,399
story and it was about not just about

1723
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:07,380
the wizard robes or any of that because

1724
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:08,698
I find that so amazing like the pictures

1725
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,140
of you guys with wearing the wizard

1726
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:12,238
robes and being very you know serious

1727
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,980
about all this but how well you treated

1728
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,079
the land and how you respected the land

1729
01:13:13,979 --> 01:13:17,579
and the culture that came before in a

1730
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,340
lot of your writings you talk about even

1731
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:22,198
finding ancient like the ancient

1732
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:24,420
petroglyphs but also some items and

1733
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:25,738
stuff that you guys would not take you'd

1734
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,319
leave it there because that's where it

1735
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:30,299
was and and all and leaving nothing not

1736
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,198
even Footprints behind so I was

1737
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,699
wondering if you could talk a little bit

1738
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,299
about the spiritual aspect of magic

1739
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:35,299
Canyon

1740
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:42,479
um well when we first started exploring

1741
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,198
it I started from the bottom up where it

1742
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:49,439
flowed into another Canyon which flowed

1743
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:52,678
into another Canyon and

1744
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:54,719
that's where I first met a mountain lion

1745
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:57,658
I'm pretty sure it was it wasn't a

1746
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:59,698
Jaguar but we came up with the term you

1747
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:01,859
know mad Jag that I had come upon

1748
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:04,379
because it was screeching at me in the

1749
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:06,719
dark when I was trying to go to sleep oh

1750
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:08,819
my God that Canyon oh my god when we got

1751
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,100
further up the canyon and found these

1752
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:12,840
spots we started finding Boulders just

1753
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:17,039
covered with pictograph I mean

1754
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:19,319
petroglyphs and in 15 minutes that rock

1755
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:21,960
that you had a photo of let's see I'm

1756
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:23,639
gonna try to find this yeah we hadn't we

1757
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,859
had a projectile point and all these

1758
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,300
pieces of pottery and we just left them

1759
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:31,679
there like a little

1760
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:34,980
little Shrine or altar yeah we also

1761
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,719
found a cave across from our garden the

1762
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:38,039
first year where I was working with that

1763
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:42,359
tall guy

1764
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:45,300
um and in this cave was a uh those are

1765
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:47,099
Colombians there this is the Colombian

1766
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:49,199
right here yeah those are all the ones

1767
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:52,500
that's as big as they got this is close

1768
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:55,619
to Thanksgiving this photo that's wild

1769
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:58,979
they they grew huge but they they just

1770
01:14:55,619 --> 01:15:00,119
they needed to get into December in the

1771
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:03,000
tropical

1772
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:06,479
see where's the petrolys here

1773
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,600
there we go there's some beautiful

1774
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:11,459
and we we did these costumes and things

1775
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,320
thinking that someday we would do a

1776
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,840
movie you know and that's why we were

1777
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:18,179
doing this and here's the I still have

1778
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,940
this little Arrowhead here but we left

1779
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:22,859
all the pottery behind and

1780
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:26,939
and

1781
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:29,158
we've found a cave across from near our

1782
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:33,419
first Garden that had an arrow shaft in

1783
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:34,639
it it had a a single Yucca fiber

1784
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:37,679
um

1785
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:40,260
moccasin that the ancient people you

1786
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:43,319
know the made out of Yucca fiber and

1787
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:45,659
they were like about half inch thick and

1788
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:48,599
they had been chewed up a lot by a rat

1789
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:49,920
but you know they were obviously in this

1790
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,020
this cave

1791
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,920
um so we just left them there as a

1792
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,500
little

1793
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,800
Museum we we put them all on a rock

1794
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,800
together

1795
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:03,780
I'd love to go back to it

1796
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:07,979
but we um

1797
01:16:03,779 --> 01:16:11,279
the one thing we didn't do which I

1798
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:14,698
regret but it could still happen was

1799
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:17,279
take all of our old um hoses out of the

1800
01:16:14,698 --> 01:16:20,698
canyon and the pump they're still there

1801
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:23,219
yeah oh my God still there oh yeah

1802
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:25,738
they're tucked under the tree we went

1803
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:27,840
back in the 90s and the bear had pulled

1804
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:29,759
a bunch of them out so we could

1805
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,900
re-buried them and pushed them back

1806
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,060
under

1807
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:35,399
um and the pump got hiked out ultimately

1808
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,900
by someone who wanted to use it and

1809
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:38,879
that's funny

1810
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:41,158
this guy was a young

1811
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,920
stallion man he's just strapped that

1812
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:46,079
sucker on a single

1813
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,658
pack for him and hiked it out himself

1814
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:51,300
and we had taken it in two of us on a

1815
01:16:48,658 --> 01:16:53,779
pole you know between us but he just

1816
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:56,219
hiked it out yeah so

1817
01:16:53,779 --> 01:16:58,439
if you can get it out you can have it

1818
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:59,939
what year did that happen and he knew

1819
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:01,859
you guys before and you guys told him

1820
01:16:59,939 --> 01:17:04,319
about the pump existing

1821
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:09,359
he was this tall guy's mother-in-law

1822
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:11,399
okay that makes sense yeah so um he he

1823
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:14,339
went in and

1824
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:18,539
he worked he came down I think at

1825
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:21,600
Harvest Time and helped us a bit

1826
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:23,340
he since left the planet though he was

1827
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,600
much younger than all of us but he he

1828
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:29,279
lived a

1829
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:33,600
Rough and Tumble life you know and yeah

1830
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:34,439
yep he uh didn't make it but it's

1831
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,320
it's

1832
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:39,719
um the spiritual aspect

1833
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:42,539
I've slept right where he's sitting here

1834
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:44,640
a few times next to the creek and

1835
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:47,039
listened to it flowing by at night it

1836
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,719
was the most fabulous thing in the in

1837
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:52,560
talking about Dark Skies

1838
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:56,158
in 19 you know late 70s the dark skies

1839
01:17:52,560 --> 01:18:00,620
in northern Arizona were extensive

1840
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:00,619
um yeah Flagstaff was the nearest place

1841
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:07,020
um I spent 400 Days out of my life in

1842
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:10,979
the bottom of this Canyon and

1843
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:14,159
over a year of my life and it's it's

1844
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:17,399
just you know it became like my second

1845
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:19,379
home in a way I can imagine five years

1846
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:20,519
ago we grew for five years in this

1847
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:22,500
Canyon

1848
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:25,920
and

1849
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:27,479
um since then it's been just quiet I we

1850
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,658
every once in a while I'll go back and

1851
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:31,319
go out on the rim and look down in and

1852
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:33,779
um

1853
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:36,299
more people are driving in four-wheel

1854
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:38,880
drives and razors and little four by

1855
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,679
side by side Vehicles you know they're

1856
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,179
going out on all these Jeep trails and

1857
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:44,279
that but they don't know what's down

1858
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:46,800
below because they're not going to get

1859
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:48,119
out and hike down 1600 feet

1860
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,179
um

1861
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:53,158
just on a hunch and get down there and

1862
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:55,219
they wouldn't find these alluvial

1863
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:59,359
plateaus they're just too

1864
01:18:55,219 --> 01:19:03,239
buried you know that's so wild

1865
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:05,880
yeah 90 90 feet above the creek

1866
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:10,799
um you wouldn't there's no trail that

1867
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:13,260
would even remotely bump into it so yeah

1868
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,380
yeah it was a special place still is um

1869
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:19,199
I went back there four years ago looking

1870
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,460
for this trail that a Rancher had made

1871
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:23,279
years ago

1872
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:25,859
that came down not far from this

1873
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:28,319
original garden and I couldn't find the

1874
01:19:25,859 --> 01:19:30,238
trailhead again it had grown over so

1875
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:31,738
much in 10 years that when I was there

1876
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,139
to last

1877
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:36,779
hunted all over man for hours and hours

1878
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:39,119
and I know where it goes down but I just

1879
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:41,639
couldn't find the trailhead so

1880
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:44,279
I'm going to go back it's strange it was

1881
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,260
it's in a forest fire area that has

1882
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:49,679
still not been reopened

1883
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:51,960
and after uh a fire that was over a year

1884
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,279
and a half ago and I'm gonna go talk to

1885
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,939
the Forester because I want to find out

1886
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:58,920
why I have a feeling why is that

1887
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:01,559
it's not about landslides or people

1888
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:04,859
getting hurt it's exposed so many

1889
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:07,739
architecture archaeological spots from

1890
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:09,539
the trees burning and there's all this

1891
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:11,759
that they're I think they're afraid of

1892
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:15,960
people going out there and plundering

1893
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,560
yeah spots that's very human

1894
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,560
yeah

1895
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:23,819
that was more used and where the guys

1896
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:27,420
from Jerome were using it

1897
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:29,158
um I've seen skulls

1898
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:32,640
just laying on the surface where people

1899
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:35,460
had dug to burial sites you know ancient

1900
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:39,239
burial sites It's just sad but uh wild

1901
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:42,060
it goes on yeah Raiders of the Lost Art

1902
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:44,158
they did an article in Tempe in the

1903
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:47,219
early 80s about guys who would go out

1904
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:50,579
and just look for burial sites and dig

1905
01:20:47,219 --> 01:20:52,859
them up oh wow there's plundered one of

1906
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:54,658
them I knew and he got busted got five

1907
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:58,579
years in prison

1908
01:20:54,658 --> 01:21:01,439
um because of you know ancient

1909
01:20:58,579 --> 01:21:02,880
that's what happens I mean ancient grave

1910
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,099
robbing is something that's been going

1911
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,260
on for a long long time and they get

1912
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:10,199
they get sold on the private Market to

1913
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:12,179
collectors and you know the origin of

1914
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,979
you know all that it's it's definitely a

1915
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:15,779
I mean it's a shame that it happens but

1916
01:21:13,979 --> 01:21:18,839
it it seems like it goes on anywhere

1917
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:20,399
there's ancient Humanity that existed

1918
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:24,900
oh yeah

1919
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:26,879
Egypt yeah Egypt Egypt would be the one

1920
01:21:24,899 --> 01:21:29,339
of the primary sources sure

1921
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,279
yeah yeah

1922
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:34,860
so I don't know I don't I mean we could

1923
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:37,079
this conversation could likely go in a

1924
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:37,979
million different directions yeah I

1925
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:40,380
think they're feeling this is going to

1926
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:42,299
be like a nine-parter it could be it

1927
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:44,400
would probably be more than just this

1928
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,500
one part because we can't touch on

1929
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:49,679
everything but one of the things I do

1930
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:51,960
want to touch on is that one one thing

1931
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,940
that's like really interesting demands

1932
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,460
ourselves is that

1933
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:58,738
um you know some of these you know we

1934
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,239
got a little off topic on Haze and you

1935
01:21:58,738 --> 01:22:01,979
know and but some of this stuff with

1936
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,279
Haze and skunk one and some of these

1937
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:08,459
American strains a lot of uh us younger

1938
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:10,738
folk our first like legitimate history

1939
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,300
on them that we know of comes from when

1940
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:14,939
they made their way over to Holland

1941
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,560
right and that's when they kind of

1942
01:22:14,939 --> 01:22:18,658
became famous and started getting bread

1943
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,640
with and started getting sold where

1944
01:22:18,658 --> 01:22:22,979
people could hear about them and then

1945
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,860
you have people like Rob and and Sam and

1946
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:28,379
stuff like that who tell their story but

1947
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:31,259
it's very you know with historians or

1948
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,420
whatever it's always cool to get a

1949
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,520
different perspective from someone you

1950
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:38,640
know an alternate Source from the same

1951
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:41,580
era right and you were talking before

1952
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:44,039
about how for a minute there or for a

1953
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:45,960
year or two you were Sam and Rob's

1954
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:48,000
biggest customer

1955
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,619
right yep in the sense that you bought

1956
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
you bought something like if I remember

1957
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:55,460
correctly off the top of my head

1958
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,460
something like 3 000 skunk one seeds

1959
01:22:56,179 --> 01:23:03,359
was that 1978 or 1979 something like

1960
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,859
that you said 79.80 and and on the back

1961
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,380
of this if you look at it up close it

1962
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:11,519
says that these were bred for the 1980

1963
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:12,679
in 1980 for the 1981 season do you still

1964
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,960
have it

1965
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:17,039
yeah so you still have that

1966
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,920
yeah

1967
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:22,439
oh yeah and oh my I was telling Rahul

1968
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,000
yesterday some of the loads we got from

1969
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:28,019
from the uh

1970
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,520
cartel in Mexico at a certain point in

1971
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,620
1980

1972
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,780
for roughly

1973
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:37,198
82 to 84.

1974
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:38,639
um we would get we moved our first load

1975
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,919
so quickly that they sent us another

1976
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:43,340
load that was wasn't meant for us it had

1977
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,420
labels in it from some one in California

1978
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:46,860
and I've got two or three of these

1979
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:50,039
labels I know you'd like to have them

1980
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:53,519
and I'd be glad this time I

1981
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:55,319
um Sam wanted them too Sam collects yeah

1982
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,260
yes

1983
01:23:55,319 --> 01:24:02,939
this one this one was

1984
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:05,219
it was a a Santa Claus in a uh in a uh

1985
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:07,619
wagon pulled by horses and it was in a

1986
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:09,960
black it's a black and white label and

1987
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:12,238
then we got another one a different time

1988
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,980
there was someone else's load but

1989
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:16,919
because we were moving them faster they

1990
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:19,139
just sent it to us and it was a raccoon

1991
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,899
on the label and it was from Northern

1992
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:25,400
California and um yeah it was it was

1993
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:25,399
funny but these

1994
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:28,619
yeah

1995
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,659
these are precious

1996
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:32,399
um little mementos

1997
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:36,179
and

1998
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:38,399
I I went to Amsterdam in 1969 right out

1999
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:40,560
of high school I went on seven weeks to

2000
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:42,960
Europe with a friend and that's the

2001
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,620
first place I tried to get high I was at

2002
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,239
the club Paradisio and I couldn't I

2003
01:24:46,619 --> 01:24:51,300
didn't smoke cigarettes so I took a big

2004
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:53,579
hit of of something and I coughed my

2005
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:56,039
lungs I couldn't even get it in deep

2006
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:59,100
enough to get it but to give you an idea

2007
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:02,179
this guy was selling a pound of of

2008
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:05,820
Turkish weed for fifteen dollars

2009
01:25:02,179 --> 01:25:09,719
it was in a shoe box a shoebox full was

2010
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:12,599
15 bucks and I have no idea

2011
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:15,840
huh do you think it was like

2012
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:18,239
yeah it was probably you know like

2013
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,460
bagweed from Turkey yeah that's dark

2014
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,559
brown it didn't look good

2015
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:25,079
um but I bought my first chunk of hash

2016
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,780
and I actually smuggled it back in 1969

2017
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:28,380
I was nervous as heck yeah okay

2018
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:29,698
um

2019
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:33,659
I didn't

2020
01:25:29,698 --> 01:25:36,238
actually get high until later in 69 when

2021
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:37,859
I went to college that was the the first

2022
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,939
time and I don't know if I had that hash

2023
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:43,799
still then or not but Denver in 1969 had

2024
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:47,879
everything you know

2025
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:48,539
Panama Red Colombian Mexican

2026
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,940
um

2027
01:25:48,539 --> 01:25:53,399
every sort of acid you could possibly

2028
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,799
want was being sold at On The Hill in

2029
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:58,559
Boulder so yeah all you have to do is

2030
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:02,400
drive over to Boulder and hang out

2031
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,659
yeah was it called back then it was just

2032
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,299
called the hill

2033
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:08,819
it's called the hill and Boulder yeah it

2034
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:11,579
was in the next is near the university

2035
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:15,119
but it was this stretch

2036
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:18,119
and it still really works yeah there's a

2037
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:19,859
bookstore at the top where

2038
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:21,119
um I actually saw Ellen Ginsburg reading

2039
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:25,039
the book

2040
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:28,500
um it was called brilliant works and

2041
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:30,420
tulagi on the hill is still there it's a

2042
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:32,880
place where they have live music it's a

2043
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:35,219
bar with live music I saw lightning

2044
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,840
Hopkins there and a few other amazing

2045
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:38,340
people

2046
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:41,520
um so wild

2047
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:43,679
yeah and it opened and I think I have a

2048
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:47,159
photo of it like in my

2049
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:51,060
um Chronicles I think in 64 it opened

2050
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:52,500
yeah I mean I was really a kid then but

2051
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:54,120
yeah um

2052
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:57,960
so

2053
01:26:54,119 --> 01:27:00,000
the uh what what channel are we on now

2054
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,439
oh well yeah I mean that's funny so so

2055
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,859
when I went when I was going to Boulder

2056
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:06,419
in the 90s it that hill was still a

2057
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:08,880
place that you could go and buy weed and

2058
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:11,279
acid it had transformed and it was

2059
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:13,739
called it was called hippie Hill

2060
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:15,359
nice right then

2061
01:27:13,738 --> 01:27:17,279
um and it was still a spot that you

2062
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:19,559
could go and yeah you could get um

2063
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:22,259
obviously the the you know the type of

2064
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:25,260
weed had changed but the ability to go

2065
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:28,260
there and and meet someone and score a

2066
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:30,840
bag of weed uh and you know the cops

2067
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:32,520
sort of tolerated it and tolerated a

2068
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,139
little bit of trade going on there or

2069
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,060
whatever so

2070
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:38,219
um it's a I didn't realize how early

2071
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:39,659
that had started

2072
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:42,000
um because at that point by the time

2073
01:27:39,658 --> 01:27:44,158
that I had been going uh which was the

2074
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,340
mid 90s late 90s it would have been

2075
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:49,920
ongoing that then for 30 some years

2076
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:52,739
right um but what the the thread we were

2077
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:56,579
on is I would love to know and I'm sure

2078
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:58,859
Matt would too what Rob or Sam told you

2079
01:27:56,579 --> 01:28:00,479
about their skunk one lines

2080
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:02,158
like you know aside from the

2081
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:03,779
descriptions and stuff like that like

2082
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,658
what they told you about what was in

2083
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:08,819
them or why they were excited about them

2084
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:10,859
what got you excited about them to buy

2085
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:12,899
so many and then what your experience

2086
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:14,639
was like actually growing them in terms

2087
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:17,939
of like what they grew like what they

2088
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,859
smelled like were they superior to the

2089
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:23,039
Mexicans you were growing anything like

2090
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:24,559
that would be probably wonderful to chat

2091
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,779
about

2092
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:31,860
well I met Rob through High Times he was

2093
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:33,960
he wrote articles a few and yeah at the

2094
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:36,839
end of the article he always put

2095
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,880
something like if you want to

2096
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,920
um if you're interested in any of the

2097
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,900
things I wrote about or these seeds

2098
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:47,039
you can contact me through the magazine

2099
01:28:42,899 --> 01:28:49,019
so I wrote a letter to High Times to Rob

2100
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,119
and I put my phone number in there and

2101
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:53,280
he called me up and that's how we hooked

2102
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,738
up because the

2103
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:58,259
the first year I grew skunk I had

2104
01:28:55,738 --> 01:28:59,879
already had two years actually three

2105
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:02,280
years of growing before that but the

2106
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:06,539
year before I made enough money that I

2107
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:08,880
could afford I when I saw and heard his

2108
01:29:06,539 --> 01:29:11,460
description and other people's of skunk

2109
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,020
number one I just went this is what I

2110
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:15,179
want to grow something that has a

2111
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:16,860
reputation and and these guys are

2112
01:29:15,179 --> 01:29:19,800
breeders he's written a book on botany

2113
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:23,460
for Craig's sake so

2114
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:25,320
um he um I said yeah I want to get 3 000

2115
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:28,198
seats they were two bucks a piece and he

2116
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:29,939
he knocked it down to 175. and he flew

2117
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:31,500
to Phoenix delivered them to me because

2118
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:35,219
you're not going to put that in the mail

2119
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:38,760
back then yeah and yeah 500 in the mail

2120
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:40,319

2121
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,360
Sky Harbor

2122
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:45,658
drove him up to Cottonwood where I lived

2123
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:46,619
he stayed a few days and

2124
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:50,219
um

2125
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:54,359
again 5500 in cash and he was super

2126
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:56,039
happy when he came up he had this little

2127
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:59,219
um zip case that he pulled out of his

2128
01:29:56,039 --> 01:30:03,000
jacket and he had he had pre-rolled

2129
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:05,880
joints of Thai of Colombian of oaxacan

2130
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,158
of skunk number one and hit and he was

2131
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,500
standing there and he gave me one hit of

2132
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,179
something out in my living room and I

2133
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,560
was laying on the floor after that and

2134
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:15,658
he was just standing there talking away

2135
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:17,159
smoke and the rest of the whole joint

2136
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:21,539
and he said oh but you got to try this

2137
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:24,000
ties this time strain and I've never I

2138
01:30:21,539 --> 01:30:26,639
my friend in Scottsdale who was I mean

2139
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,439
in Tempe who was the dealer he can smoke

2140
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:31,079
like that my Colombian friend for sure

2141
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:34,859
he started smoking when he was seven in

2142
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:37,920
the Cali Colombia but my friend in Tempe

2143
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:40,799
he would roll 10 hash joints

2144
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,859
pin joints yeah just crumbled up hash

2145
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:47,219
and smoked them in a day's time in 100

2146
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:49,979
degree driving a tractor that was his

2147
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:54,179
motivation just chain smoke hash joints

2148
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:56,579
Jesus Rob was pretty much like that so I

2149
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:58,859
I don't remember him describing to me

2150
01:30:56,579 --> 01:31:02,579
what skunk was like it was what I read

2151
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:03,719
in high times that it just this skunky

2152
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:07,859
smell and

2153
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:09,859
it was going to be also have some exotic

2154
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:13,198
strains in it

2155
01:31:09,859 --> 01:31:16,619
the original skunk number one didn't

2156
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:18,779
have Indian you know the Kerala India in

2157
01:31:16,619 --> 01:31:21,539
it at all it was just

2158
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:23,880
three countries I think right

2159
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:27,899
um Colombian Mexican Afghan

2160
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:30,000
yep it was just those three and

2161
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:32,579
I had smoked each of those individually

2162
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,639
but the fact that this was a hybrid that

2163
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:37,439
was so potent and everything I don't

2164
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:39,539
know what I had read I have all those

2165
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,759
old High Times magazines I have the

2166
01:31:39,539 --> 01:31:43,979
first High Times I have the first Black

2167
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,980
Belt Magazine I collect all kinds of

2168
01:31:43,979 --> 01:31:50,399
weird [ __ ] I love that too

2169
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:52,259
yeah and memorabilia we'll get into that

2170
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:53,759
I'll I'll send you some things

2171
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:54,600
um through a collection you just let me

2172
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,800
know

2173
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,699
but

2174
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,520
um

2175
01:31:56,698 --> 01:32:02,519
The Afghani number one

2176
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:05,280
I did get a few from him as a gift I

2177
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:07,500
think from buying all the skunk and it's

2178
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:10,859
funny because this says Afghani Hindu

2179
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:13,020
Kush hashish seeds I noticed his label

2180
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:15,299
and yet on the back he says this is

2181
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:18,000
skunk number one and I have one of these

2182
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:19,679
envelopes with Afghani number one

2183
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,279
um yeah so

2184
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:25,139
is kind of you know and he also has in

2185
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:27,479
letters here extra early

2186
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:30,000
so yeah I I was reading it it actually

2187
01:32:27,479 --> 01:32:31,678
is a description for a pure Afghani is

2188
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,539
what it is like the whole thing is a

2189
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,100
description for a pure unadulterated

2190
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:36,300
Afghani but then it says skunk one right

2191
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,560
there

2192
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:42,960
these envelopes had two giant horse caps

2193
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,860
um with 50 seeds in each one so there

2194
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:49,920
were 100 seeds in two big joke I mean

2195
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:52,319
cellulose caps yeah he'd get 50 cents in

2196
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,539
each one and

2197
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:56,939
I don't know what happened to the many

2198
01:32:54,539 --> 01:32:58,439
many of these very different people over

2199
01:32:56,939 --> 01:33:00,899
the years wanted one and I gave him one

2200
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:03,799
and my sure I think my my UK partner

2201
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:03,799
still has several

2202
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:06,840
um

2203
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:10,019
I don't know

2204
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:12,659
how else to Rob came down to our garden

2205
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:14,040
once and that's when he said he was

2206
01:33:12,658 --> 01:33:15,779
amazed that we could grow out of dirt

2207
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:18,479
yeah

2208
01:33:15,779 --> 01:33:22,139
you've never seen Arizona plants I don't

2209
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:26,039
think before and we averaged 6.8 ounces

2210
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:27,840
across our entire Garden per plant which

2211
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:30,658
roughly almost a half a pound per plant

2212
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:33,060
which growing in the dirt yeah he said

2213
01:33:30,658 --> 01:33:35,219
he was used to two three four pound

2214
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:39,679
plants in Northern California you know

2215
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:42,719
up in that black soil but um

2216
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:45,779
well there's a there's a there's a

2217
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:47,399
volume you know thing too and like plant

2218
01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:49,380
numbers

2219
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:51,179
um and so in in Northern California I

2220
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:53,279
mean some people went crazy but a lot of

2221
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:55,679
times people tried to

2222
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:57,059
um maximize how much they could get per

2223
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,100
plant

2224
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:00,960
to not get you know so if they did get

2225
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:03,000
in trouble in Northern California it

2226
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,880
would be for Less plants

2227
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,738
that was a big thing so it's way way

2228
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:10,020
easier and I think you get better weed

2229
01:34:07,738 --> 01:34:12,059
growing up six or seven or eight ounce

2230
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:13,500
plant versus a four or five or six pound

2231
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:15,659
plant

2232
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:17,880
um but numbers did play a role at least

2233
01:34:15,658 --> 01:34:20,879
in Northern California where I'm from

2234
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,880
country

2235
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:25,198
did they what what were the type Aromas

2236
01:34:23,579 --> 01:34:27,238
that you got off the skunk one that

2237
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:31,198
first year you grew them

2238
01:34:27,238 --> 01:34:33,539
it it was very it was very skunky note

2239
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,939
you know the smell of a skunk when you

2240
01:34:33,539 --> 01:34:40,139
drive over it on the highway it was that

2241
01:34:35,939 --> 01:34:42,178
exact no it we were we were stupefied by

2242
01:34:40,139 --> 01:34:44,520
it actually we were when this is

2243
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:47,579
incredible and it didn't smell like that

2244
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:51,300
growing so much but when you when it was

2245
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:53,698
harvested the flowers dried and you

2246
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,659
crush you know a flower and it was skunk

2247
01:34:53,698 --> 01:34:57,719
smell

2248
01:34:54,658 --> 01:34:59,519
and it was pretty damn potent we rolled

2249
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:01,619
a joint once and went to this topless

2250
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,679
club called the highlighter that we

2251
01:35:01,619 --> 01:35:07,079
liked in Phoenix and

2252
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:09,239
one of the two of the dancers we went in

2253
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:12,238
the ladies bathroom with two of the

2254
01:35:09,238 --> 01:35:13,979
dancers and we each had one puff that's

2255
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:15,658
all before we got busted by another

2256
01:35:13,979 --> 01:35:17,399
dancer who came in and was in charge

2257
01:35:15,658 --> 01:35:19,738
that night and said you guys have to get

2258
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:22,138
out of here and so we went and sat down

2259
01:35:19,738 --> 01:35:25,079
the ladies I think they had one puff

2260
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:27,300
each more it was they were these were

2261
01:35:25,079 --> 01:35:29,760
New York needles we called them or pin

2262
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:32,159
joints where you had to really

2263
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,300
you know just to get a hit and we were

2264
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:36,479
sitting there and they came out of the

2265
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:38,699
bathroom they walked around the bar

2266
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:41,279
they were laughing and they smiled at us

2267
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:43,319
and then they walked right into a table

2268
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,019
knocked it over all the drinks went over

2269
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:48,119
they fell in the ground themselves and

2270
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:49,920
we were just sitting there laughing they

2271
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:52,920
were they had never been that high in

2272
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,500
their life and we found out later that

2273
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:57,179
they were um scared almost

2274
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:02,219
I bet

2275
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:04,800
but you know in 1980 or 81

2276
01:36:02,219 --> 01:36:06,719
there was you know we had already smoked

2277
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,600
this sensimilla from Santa Barbara that

2278
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:11,579
was very Piney and I've and there was

2279
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:14,460
Thai weed around and other things but

2280
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:17,519
for some reason this thing packed a

2281
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:19,679
punch really quite a punch and

2282
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:22,739
I I don't know how people would rate it

2283
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,960
today compared to all these you know

2284
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:28,279
chem dogs and and all the other

2285
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:31,800
varieties that people have bred up to 35

2286
01:36:28,279 --> 01:36:33,840
THC or whatever they're at now

2287
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,239
um but as you know the Entourage effect

2288
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,760
is what counts the total package you

2289
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:41,339
know the terpenes the bioflavonoids

2290
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:44,280
everything everything someone said that

2291
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:46,619
the test on an original Afghani I mean

2292
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:51,059
uh skunk number one was it was only like

2293
01:36:46,619 --> 01:36:54,359
14 or 15 THC yeah most of the stuff I

2294
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:57,539
like Falls in between 8 to 18.

2295
01:36:54,359 --> 01:37:01,079
yeah so all the other ingredients the

2296
01:36:57,539 --> 01:37:01,738
terpenes perhaps that skunky terpene

2297
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:03,238
um

2298
01:37:01,738 --> 01:37:06,658
profile

2299
01:37:03,238 --> 01:37:08,399
and other things really added up

2300
01:37:06,658 --> 01:37:12,000
it's really nice to have another account

2301
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:14,579
that isn't from Rob or Sam about skunk

2302
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,960
one having that same smell even back

2303
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:17,579
then because it's it's been heavily

2304
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:19,859
debated for a long time whether that was

2305
01:37:17,579 --> 01:37:22,319
true that skunk one had that smell or if

2306
01:37:19,859 --> 01:37:24,359
it never happened yeah

2307
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:27,059
yeah because

2308
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:29,399
the stuff that got sold in Europe

2309
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:31,800
um it sounds like Rob and and Sam or

2310
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:34,859
maybe Sam only kept breeding away from

2311
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:39,119
that Aroma and So eventually it became

2312
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:41,880
very floral very Citrus uh maybe a

2313
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:43,859
little cheese maybe some grapes

2314
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:47,039
um but people have been hunting for that

2315
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:50,099
skunky smell in skunk and seeds yeah

2316
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:53,219
ever since and yet it seems like it

2317
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:56,039
existed in the 70s and the early 80s and

2318
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:58,260
then it kind of went away

2319
01:37:56,039 --> 01:38:00,359
um and he maybe they successfully bred

2320
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:02,460
it out of the line entirely because

2321
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:05,039
people have really hunted through skunk

2322
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:08,520
one trying to find recessives that are a

2323
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:10,679
throwback to what you just described

2324
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:15,360
hey uh

2325
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:20,520
so I uh I moved out to NorCal to grow

2326
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:25,259
for a season and uh it was 1985 and when

2327
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:27,659
I first arrived in Ukiah I had taken a a

2328
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:30,000
Greyhound bus and my instructions were

2329
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:33,059
to meet my new partners

2330
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,979
at the laundromat which was near the

2331
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:36,659
airport and the bus station I guess I'm

2332
01:38:34,979 --> 01:38:39,178
not sure that's that part's a little

2333
01:38:36,658 --> 01:38:42,079
fuzzy but I'll never forget you know

2334
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:46,139
arriving in Ukiah getting off the bus

2335
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:48,238
and as I'm walking towards the

2336
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:51,060
laundromat you know following the

2337
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:55,819
instructions I'd been given the entire

2338
01:38:51,060 --> 01:39:00,840
town smelled like skunk

2339
01:38:55,819 --> 01:39:02,939
the entire town I mean wow everywhere I

2340
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:05,100
walked and I I had to wait for a couple

2341
01:39:02,939 --> 01:39:07,079
hours so after a while I got bored of

2342
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:10,079
standing around waiting for my buddy to

2343
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:12,779
drive down off the mountain and and you

2344
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:13,738
know pick me up so I I walked around a

2345
01:39:12,779 --> 01:39:17,099
little bit

2346
01:39:13,738 --> 01:39:19,379
the whole town smelled just like you

2347
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:23,159
know a roadkill you know people confuse

2348
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:25,260
the Rotting Flesh roadkill part with a

2349
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:26,460
look when I when a skunk gets hit on the

2350
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:29,039
side of the road you don't smell

2351
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:32,039
anything but the skunk right

2352
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:35,460
it's not about rotting anything yes no

2353
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:39,119
yeah it's just that sulfurous uh you

2354
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:41,639
know that's been smashed yeah yeah I I

2355
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:44,599
live about 15 minutes for I can be in

2356
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:48,300
Ukiah in about 15 minutes from my house

2357
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:50,340
beautiful so you said 1885 that's the

2358
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:52,440
what part of where did you get that

2359
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:54,179
first year do you remember what part of

2360
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:57,719
of Mendocino you grew in do you remember

2361
01:39:54,179 --> 01:40:00,779
where you were now 1985 was the influx

2362
01:39:57,719 --> 01:40:03,539
like the major major influx of indicas

2363
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:04,800
into that region I mean there of course

2364
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:07,019
there were some you know making their

2365
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,300
way bits and pieces throughout the 70s

2366
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:11,219
and whatnot the 85 was like the smash

2367
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:13,020
year for indicas right out in that area

2368
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:14,520
so it makes sense a shitload of skunk

2369
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:17,280
would be in that town

2370
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:19,760
you know the indicus that I grew in um

2371
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:24,539
in 81 and 82

2372
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:28,380
uh were from NorCal from Ukiah and and

2373
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:30,300
you know the the towns around there and

2374
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:32,400
they were picked up by a friend of mine

2375
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:35,100
who was hitchhiking around there for for

2376
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:37,738
like two years and every time he'd he'd

2377
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:40,560
you know get picked up he would offer to

2378
01:40:37,738 --> 01:40:43,019
to you know would you like hey I've got

2379
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:45,179
some weed do you want to smoke one and

2380
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,440
everybody always said yes but they said

2381
01:40:45,179 --> 01:40:48,480
you know

2382
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:51,238
um let's not smoke yours here go in the

2383
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:52,619
glove compartment and let's let's smoke

2384
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:55,198
some of mine

2385
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:57,479
and he'd pull out the bag and here you

2386
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:59,219
you roll it and we'll smoke it and as he

2387
01:40:57,479 --> 01:41:00,779
rolled there were always a few seeds in

2388
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:06,480
there and he'd ask him if he could keep

2389
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:09,779
him yeah so my guy yeah I mean my my um

2390
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:13,259
my first interaction with Indica was you

2391
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:17,340
know Christmas 81. he came back from

2392
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:19,699
California to to visit and he had a

2393
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:23,760
collection of like six different

2394
01:41:19,698 --> 01:41:25,919
afghanis wow um and a story to go with

2395
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:29,940
each one like there was one that he

2396
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:32,699
called Ranger weed and he had he had

2397
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:36,960
smoked this weed with a forest ranger

2398
01:41:32,698 --> 01:41:39,658
like a and this guy had and it was I

2399
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:42,239
swear it was it was what I think where

2400
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:45,479
Afghani number one came from it was a

2401
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:48,359
very coarse you know Afghani with kind

2402
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:49,019
of a candelabra style

2403
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:50,579
um

2404
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:53,159
you know

2405
01:41:50,579 --> 01:41:56,639
uh attack there was another one he

2406
01:41:53,158 --> 01:42:00,719
called plain weed and uh this was on his

2407
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:03,300
on his way home he he at SFO

2408
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:05,760
he was walking through the parking lot

2409
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:07,800
and there's a guy sitting in a Corvette

2410
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:10,500
convertible

2411
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:13,320
um smoking weed right and he walked up

2412
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:14,760
and he gives him the look you know and I

2413
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:17,399
don't know if he you know held up his

2414
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:20,340
finger like hey can we smoke and the guy

2415
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:23,279
invited him to join him in the car

2416
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:25,920
and um you know he got a couple of seeds

2417
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:30,679
out of that encounter also that turned

2418
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:34,859
out to be an an F1 Thai Afghani hybrid

2419
01:42:30,679 --> 01:42:36,840
which was just amazing and I knew what

2420
01:42:34,859 --> 01:42:40,259
exactly what it was because I had grown

2421
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:42,960
pure Thai the year before yeah right so

2422
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:46,560
I had these pure afghanis and I had this

2423
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:49,139
I had pure tie the year before

2424
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:51,960
and this stuff was just right in the

2425
01:42:49,139 --> 01:42:54,179
middle it was a 50 50 cross and you know

2426
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:56,639
I used to sit there and make notes about

2427
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:59,399
you know I'd sit and smoke it and write

2428
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:02,880
down the the effects and The Taste and

2429
01:42:59,399 --> 01:43:05,238
compare it with other stuff and

2430
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:08,100
um just amazing notebooks right yeah

2431
01:43:05,238 --> 01:43:09,299
that's amazing I do yeah that when you

2432
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,980
first told me that you've kept these

2433
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:12,600
notebooks like on sense and stuff I was

2434
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:14,698
like man this guy's gonna be my best

2435
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,920
friend I'm telling you this is amazing

2436
01:43:14,698 --> 01:43:19,198
like it's just it's it's only a certain

2437
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:20,880
type of people that really get this far

2438
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:23,158
into weed I think

2439
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,000
um and and a lot of us think it has

2440
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:26,519
something to do with being on the

2441
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,779
Spectrum you know because we we get so

2442
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:29,280
far into something so many people are

2443
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:31,800
just like it's just we didn't smoke it

2444
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,300
and we're like I mean so much more one

2445
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:35,639
of one of the one of the cool Parts

2446
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:38,460
about doing this uh these chats that

2447
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:40,920
Matt and I do is like the realization

2448
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:42,840
that like the vast majority of our

2449
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:45,779
history is oral

2450
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,699
right it's very little of it is very

2451
01:43:45,779 --> 01:43:50,579
little of it is written down you know

2452
01:43:47,698 --> 01:43:53,039
right and as people age evidence right

2453
01:43:50,579 --> 01:43:54,658
yeah yeah it was evidence and then so

2454
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:56,100
there's all these cool stories out there

2455
01:43:54,658 --> 01:43:58,500
and there's all these bits and pieces

2456
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:01,739
like Matt had mentioned there was great

2457
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:03,738
debate like was Sam and and Rob lying

2458
01:44:01,738 --> 01:44:06,118
about how skunky it was in the beginning

2459
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:07,979
and you know because by the time they

2460
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:11,158
took skunk one to Amsterdam it was

2461
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:14,039
fruity and citrusy and floral and all

2462
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:16,079
that and so you know these these stories

2463
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:17,760
and stuff from from the region and what

2464
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:20,340
things were like

2465
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:23,460
um is a big deal

2466
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:25,260
um because now people look at me and you

2467
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:27,600
know I'm only in my mid-40s you know but

2468
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:29,280
people think I'm old as [ __ ] and like

2469
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,280
they want to hear like my stories from

2470
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:34,439
the 90s but your guys's stories from the

2471
01:44:32,279 --> 01:44:37,679
70s and 80s are like a full generation

2472
01:44:34,439 --> 01:44:38,759
beat before that are these old mad Jag

2473
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,118
notebooks

2474
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:43,980
yep oh my God that's amazing and your

2475
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:46,099
handwriting is so much better than mine

2476
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:49,979
it's just around

2477
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:51,719
my friends everything yep they made it

2478
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:53,399
through the busts like the but like when

2479
01:44:51,719 --> 01:44:55,859
you guys did get busted they didn't go

2480
01:44:53,399 --> 01:45:00,238
after the notebooks and stuff not so

2481
01:44:55,859 --> 01:45:05,059
those a fees came in in like 1980 81 not

2482
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:09,779
85 and I grew I grew mine in 81 and 82

2483
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:13,260
and I was the only one in practice you

2484
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:16,618
know that anybody in I knew that had

2485
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:18,719
this stuff right yeah that year the very

2486
01:45:16,618 --> 01:45:21,658
next year

2487
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,698
all of my friends had their own Affy

2488
01:45:21,658 --> 01:45:27,920
right that they'd gotten from different

2489
01:45:23,698 --> 01:45:30,719
sources from wherever you know I mean 83

2490
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,219
everybody had it it was making its way

2491
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,260
around the country probably through

2492
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:36,359
deadhead you know Dead shows and stuff

2493
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:38,219
like that let me ask you a question

2494
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:41,158
about that then

2495
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:42,359
um a lot of the old heads have said that

2496
01:45:41,158 --> 01:45:44,219
you know

2497
01:45:42,359 --> 01:45:46,139
um have told me that like basically like

2498
01:45:44,219 --> 01:45:47,760
Mendocino and Humboldt was almost pure

2499
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:50,279
sativa

2500
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:52,380
um and people really like the buzz and

2501
01:45:50,279 --> 01:45:54,000
the flavor and the effect and they said

2502
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:56,760
one of the big things that drove

2503
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,560
indica's popularity was when in 81 when

2504
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:00,659
they started flying helicopters in my

2505
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,400
neck of the woods right getting

2506
01:46:00,658 --> 01:46:04,738
something that would finish in September

2507
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,118
or early October was a lot safer than

2508
01:46:04,738 --> 01:46:09,359
something that took till Thanksgiving

2509
01:46:06,118 --> 01:46:11,039
and was this giant thing right yeah

2510
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:13,319
um and so that started spreading it

2511
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:14,819
because police pressure and hiding it

2512
01:46:13,319 --> 01:46:17,880
and all that became more important

2513
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:19,198
indicas were shorter and squatter but a

2514
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:21,840
lot of people told me that that they

2515
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:23,519
didn't like the buzz as much maybe you

2516
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,279
could could you talk for a minute about

2517
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,139
your experiences versus the the Mexicans

2518
01:46:26,279 --> 01:46:30,359
and the ties and the Colombians and all

2519
01:46:28,139 --> 01:46:32,400
those you were growing versus like

2520
01:46:30,359 --> 01:46:33,599
smoking indicas at first and like what

2521
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:34,920
the differences were and what your

2522
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,920
preferences were

2523
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:40,739
yeah you know I mean and today what

2524
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:43,199
people think of is Indica usually is

2525
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:45,718
some sort of hybrid

2526
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:49,738
um because there were pure indicas back

2527
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:54,480
then that had a very sedative effect

2528
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:58,559
without making your brain fuzzy

2529
01:46:54,479 --> 01:47:01,738
right I mean it was cold

2530
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:04,260
yeah yeah calming and peaceful and kind

2531
01:47:01,738 --> 01:47:07,198
of dreamy but it didn't give you that ER

2532
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:09,900
you know that that that just you know

2533
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:12,439
the cow what we you know couch lock

2534
01:47:09,899 --> 01:47:16,138
is not just a body effect it's it's a

2535
01:47:12,439 --> 01:47:19,079
stunned mental effect right where your

2536
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:21,300
brain just kind of seizes up you know

2537
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:23,880
it's like distortion on a on a guitar

2538
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:25,920
exactly

2539
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,260
um so you don't have to have that to

2540
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,359
have that body effect and most of what

2541
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:32,760
we experienced today

2542
01:47:30,359 --> 01:47:35,698
um but with that Distortion with that

2543
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:38,280
with that fuzz comes

2544
01:47:35,698 --> 01:47:41,879
um you know it's usually got a lot of

2545
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:43,738
power to it right so some of these pure

2546
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:48,300
a fees would have would have actually

2547
01:47:43,738 --> 01:47:49,259
been just kind of this just whoo slows

2548
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,940
it down

2549
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,880
right

2550
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:56,299
um peaceful very high amazing taste

2551
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:59,520
right just like just like pure hash

2552
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:01,800
tasted exactly like hash

2553
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:04,020
um you know and

2554
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:06,719
at its best right

2555
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:08,820
um but without that that that inability

2556
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:11,039
to think you might be slowed down but

2557
01:48:08,819 --> 01:48:14,039
you could still you know follow a train

2558
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:16,979
of thought uh and and eventually get

2559
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:19,800
there but with and I think that you know

2560
01:48:16,979 --> 01:48:24,238
skunk as it originally existed before

2561
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:26,940
Sam got it and and hybridized it and

2562
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:29,759
used the name for the new thing that he

2563
01:48:26,939 --> 01:48:32,638
created which was no longer what it what

2564
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:36,260
it was named after yeah

2565
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:38,159
um if anybody can follow that right

2566
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,960
blueberries the same to me it's the

2567
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:41,698
exact same thing I want to let you

2568
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:43,859
finish your thought but I'm gonna I'm

2569
01:48:41,698 --> 01:48:45,479
gonna come back to that to a part of

2570
01:48:43,859 --> 01:48:47,759
what you just said in a moment but but

2571
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:50,039
please finish your thoughts so I mean

2572
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:53,340
you know skunk was very

2573
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:56,760
um was very Afghani dominant back when

2574
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:57,719
it first came out and it was it hits you

2575
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,480
like

2576
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:03,239
like a like a sledgehammer you know

2577
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:05,399
mentally it just stunned you

2578
01:49:03,238 --> 01:49:08,339
um you couldn't think you you were just

2579
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:10,019
you were just seized up and I think that

2580
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:12,779
you know what we

2581
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:15,960
um think about as afghanis these days a

2582
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:18,779
fees indicas whatever you know the chem

2583
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:21,179
line is definitely you know got

2584
01:49:18,779 --> 01:49:22,859
hybridization going there with some kind

2585
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:25,380
of skunk

2586
01:49:22,859 --> 01:49:28,559
um which gives it you know a combination

2587
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:32,340
and that the extra power and the the

2588
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:34,739
mental kind of Sledgehammer that you

2589
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,520
know a lot of people like

2590
01:49:34,738 --> 01:49:38,638
um

2591
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,440
so contrasting you know you you went

2592
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:42,480
into this with talking about what people

2593
01:49:40,439 --> 01:49:44,638
used to grow up there in the mountains

2594
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:46,939
and as you're as you were just talking

2595
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,560
about it I was picturing Jim

2596
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:50,759
Richardson's book uh you know since

2597
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:52,820
Amelia

2598
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:56,219
uh flowers

2599
01:49:52,819 --> 01:49:57,899
right and the garden that he

2600
01:49:56,219 --> 01:50:00,300
photographed in there and took it

2601
01:49:57,899 --> 01:50:04,079
through the the phases of fluorescence

2602
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:06,840
and documented it just so beautifully

2603
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:10,019
um you know I I first saw that book in I

2604
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:12,779
guess 82 or 83 it

2605
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:16,139
um my my buddy had brought it back for

2606
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:19,039
me and said that it was on every coffee

2607
01:50:16,139 --> 01:50:22,020
table in Northern California

2608
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:23,579
it had the Big Sir hola weed and Dolores

2609
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:25,020
and all kinds of special plants in there

2610
01:50:23,579 --> 01:50:26,579
that weren't labeled and a lot of people

2611
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:28,679
don't know that that that's the original

2612
01:50:26,579 --> 01:50:30,380
Big Sur holy weed and the tripweed and

2613
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:33,239
yeah

2614
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:37,020
NorCal had had spent years you know

2615
01:50:33,238 --> 01:50:38,939
refining these imported sativa lines to

2616
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:40,739
turn them into things it would finish in

2617
01:50:38,939 --> 01:50:43,439
the season that they had there and and

2618
01:50:40,738 --> 01:50:46,259
you know selective breeding for quality

2619
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:48,299
and yield and and

2620
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:50,280
um and finish time you know things that

2621
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:52,920
would work in the in the environment you

2622
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:55,618
had there and it was you know you had

2623
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:58,440
you had created something just as just

2624
01:50:55,618 --> 01:51:01,259
as special as anything from Hawaii right

2625
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:03,658
as unique and special and uh those those

2626
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:05,400
lines I think the last thing that we you

2627
01:51:03,658 --> 01:51:07,439
know on the market today if somebody

2628
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:09,238
would go out and look for seeds that

2629
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:11,339
they could grow that would be similar to

2630
01:51:09,238 --> 01:51:14,459
that or would at least give them you

2631
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:17,239
know a hint of what it used to be would

2632
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:19,158
be if they could find a good early Pearl

2633
01:51:17,238 --> 01:51:22,738
yeah

2634
01:51:19,158 --> 01:51:25,379
right because you can still taste the

2635
01:51:22,738 --> 01:51:27,658
Mexican in there and the effects still

2636
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:29,579
have that it's still there yes there's

2637
01:51:27,658 --> 01:51:31,859
an Affy thrown in there and a half year

2638
01:51:29,579 --> 01:51:34,260
two in the mix sure of you know

2639
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:38,519
different sativas but but the sweet

2640
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:42,360
Neville called it the awaken zing

2641
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:45,780
right and uh it's it's a you know when

2642
01:51:42,359 --> 01:51:48,238
grown as Cincinnati by a gardener who

2643
01:51:45,779 --> 01:51:50,579
loves what he's doing you know small

2644
01:51:48,238 --> 01:51:54,238
numbers and and pampered and cared for

2645
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:55,979
it's it's so tasty and delicious that

2646
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:58,319
there's hardly anything that can come

2647
01:51:55,979 --> 01:52:01,559
close yeah I'm a sucker for the silver

2648
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:03,359
Pearl still but um I you know I really

2649
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,400
want early girl because that's one that

2650
01:52:03,359 --> 01:52:08,519
I've never ran but early Pearl was a big

2651
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:11,879
favorite in San Diego too amazing stuff

2652
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:14,520
yeah so those you know early girl when

2653
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:17,760
Pollyanna were you know from that that

2654
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,380
era and from that region and uh they

2655
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,719
were some of the some of those early

2656
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:24,060
hybrids when when the first athies

2657
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:25,920
showed up and they said well wow this is

2658
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:27,659
the greatest thing ever you know can you

2659
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,520
imagine growing a couple of these things

2660
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:32,158
in your garden and never seeing anything

2661
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,840
like it and falling in love with the

2662
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:35,399
hash and the first thing you're gonna do

2663
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,199
is you're gonna say I'm going to take

2664
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:40,079
this new thing which is the best thing

2665
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:42,118
ever and cross it with the best thing

2666
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:45,059
that that I've spent the last 10 years

2667
01:52:42,118 --> 01:52:48,079
making yeah right that's exactly the

2668
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:51,000
first thing you're gonna do right yep

2669
01:52:48,079 --> 01:52:53,219
in Mendo you kind of have till Halloween

2670
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,500
or maybe the first week of November if

2671
01:52:53,219 --> 01:52:58,439
you get lucky

2672
01:52:55,500 --> 01:53:00,960
um of of a good chance of reasonably

2673
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:02,399
good weather and not too much rain and

2674
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:04,739
then the cold and the rain and the

2675
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:07,618
weather starts to turn so breeding

2676
01:53:04,738 --> 01:53:09,539
breeding and Mendo and Humboldt

2677
01:53:07,618 --> 01:53:11,939
um you know you kind of have to have

2678
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:13,800
some Halloween weed at the latest maybe

2679
01:53:11,939 --> 01:53:15,539
some early November

2680
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:17,100
um but you really can't like trying to

2681
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:20,698

uh pictures and stuff like that and art

2707

of people's weed

2709

um and just uh so yeah there's a million

2713
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:31,500
directions we could go but as Matt said

2714

um made the F1 and it's

2730
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:15,000
it's gotten good reviews what's the name

2731
01:55:13,618 --> 01:55:17,880
for it

2732
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,460
what do you call it Jim oh

2733
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:23,639

2734
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:26,579
that I trust that smoke all day long

2735
01:55:23,639 --> 01:55:29,579
that live in Sedona and I said well what

2736
01:55:26,579 --> 01:55:32,219
is it on a scale of 10 and they said 9.3

2737
01:55:29,579 --> 01:55:34,519
I said well it's good we'll call it 9.3

2738
01:55:32,219 --> 01:55:39,060
that's perfect

2739
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:41,639
yeah so instead of some fancy you know

2740
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:43,920
airplane cookies or whatever

2741
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:45,420
