scene researching everything from

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,640

written by corporations and others who

35
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,879

for here yeah I can tell and like from

66
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:31,439
the type of political activities you've

67
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,259
gotten yourself into and and the The

68
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,719
Works you do for social change it's it's

69
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,399
very very humbling to watch from from a

70
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,340
person you know way over here it's what

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,140
I'd love to be doing so mad props tell

72
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,759
me a little bit about zomia tell me tell

73
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,839
me what zomia is in the first place

74
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,359
a collective

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,759
um it's uh it's a project that's working

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,819
on long-term land race conservation in

77
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,259
Southeast Asia but fundamentally it's

78
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,639
much more than that it's a social

79
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,799
movement

80
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,139
um it's a concept in political

81
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,000
philosophy and anthropology

82
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,098
um that's sort of grounded in an

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,759
understanding of the indigenous people

84
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:14,399
of the Hill tracks of Southeast Asia

85
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:17,399
it's a sort of non-jurisdictional entity

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,480
which comprises about a hundred million

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,459
people

88
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,060
um speaking you know so many different

89
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,060
languages all of whom are united in a

90
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,180
sort of a refusal to partake in the

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,939
state in paying taxes and you know being

92
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,739
conscripted and instead uh you know live

93
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,979
in the in the Hills away from everybody

94
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,280
else one of the things that unites the

95
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,259
region is the choice of crops namely

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,120
cannabis and so

97
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,098
um with a foundation in political

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,620
activism which we can get it into if you

99
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:55,500
want a sort of nucleus of of

100
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,439
cannabis breeders Growers

101
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,139
Village elders and tribal communities

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,439
formed into yeah or Collective with this

103
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,419
purpose of preservation the land race uh

104
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,239
cannabis in Southeast Asia perhaps even

105
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,378
Beyond that's amazing um can you tell me

106
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,860
what kind of pushed you in this

107
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:16,019
direction uh where did you grow up what

108
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,759
got you into the southeast Asia climate

109
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,180
stuff like that

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,879
sure uh personally I'm I'm back I'm from

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,459
The Basque country but I grew up in

112
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,500
Scotland and that was kind of where me

113
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,478
and Matthew were talking uh kind of a

114
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,478
little bit the the sort of Trainspotting

115
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,639
uh style of things you know we were

116
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,060
buying cannabis from pretty sketchy

117
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,220
places from a pretty young age and

118
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,560
I mean for those who know you you know

119
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,020
what the scene's all about and

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,639
when you catch that bug and especially

121
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,859
for us we were really lucky to get stuff

122
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,860
like gold stamped Mazar

123
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,419
um you know Goldfield like black Afghan

124
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,060
um despite being you know in a really

125
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,579
Northern remote location we did benefit

126
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,280
from some of the sort of uh the the the

127
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,500
small scale Smugglers before the the war

128
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,138
on terror and the changes in the

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,978
airports you know sort of killed that

130
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,418
and from then it was you know at 16 I

131
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,079
came out to

132
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:19,139
to to India and then to Southeast Asia

133
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:20,219
and ended up never never leaving

134
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,259
um you know a lot of my formative

135
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,240
experiences were there

136
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,520
um I fell into the into the wine

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,220
industry strangely enough as a sort of

138
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,079
you know francophone in Southeast Asia

139
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,500
right

140
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:36,899
um but you know there's this kind of

141
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,839
there's this I guess this racism I

142
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,219
suppose where where the or internalized

143
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,258
racism I don't know what how you want to

144
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,620
describe it but there's the need for

145
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,660
like a token french guy to sell wine

146
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,280
um in the fancy restaurants and it

147
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,560
doesn't matter whether he's Basque or

148
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,279
actually French or not you know close

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,379
enough you know yeah right and so I as a

150
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,659
lover of you know good taste and you

151
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,100
know and everything else I always had a

152
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,860
bit of chip on my shoulder about good

153
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,080
food sort of being so expensive and you

154
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,419
know this was my way to to be able to

155
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,579
taste what I wanted to Taste and to talk

156
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,918
with chefs and that kind of stuff and it

157
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,659
was great but I also it was great it was

158
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,639
also terrible and I got very

159
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,180
disillusioned and so when the

160
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:24,600
opportunity to sort of bring the

161
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,120
the structure of uh somelier in

162
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,580
particular to the Cannabis world came

163
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,759
about I jumped on it because it was you

164
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,019
know the the culmination and honestly 16

165
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,560
year old they wouldn't have believed it

166
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:40,198
you know it's just a dream country right

167
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,019
yeah absolutely and so

168
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,080
um basically lucky enough to be working

169
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,639
in in restaurants with a budget high

170
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,839
enough to pay for traveling in terms of

171
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,600
r d and pre-covered a lot of traveling

172
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,060
you know looking for indigenous or

173
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,220
traditional fermented beverages for for

174
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,100
food pairings

175
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,900
um let us let me in my team

176
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,639
um to be in contact with a lot of

177
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,459
communities who are also growing

178
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,840
cannabis and in the course of you know

179
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,638
spending time in these communities

180
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,579
learning how they ferment different

181
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,400
grains and cereals pulses Etc into into

182
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,859
alcohol and drinks the opportunity came

183
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,138
about to to to sort of learn more about

184
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,120
the land race cannabis and it was very

185
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,098
nicely timed

186
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,939
um a few years before the legalization

187
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:33,300
in Thailand which gave a little bit more

188
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:35,579
confidence to us and to others to be

189
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,500
able to sort of open up because as I'm

190
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,079
sure a lot of you are aware the panels

191
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,639
disease for you know engaging in

192
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,439
anything kind of isolated in Thailand

193
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,800
before legalization where we're very

194
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,560
very severe yeah and so it was yeah it

195
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,280
was really about it was about timing and

196
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,098
about passion I guess and a lot of a lot

197
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,739
of like-minded individuals with you know

198
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,959
a singular Target I guess

199
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,120
um and that Target again being the

200
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,620
conservation of of land races and I

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,418
think it's a subject which it's pretty

202
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,399
easy to be passionate about you know so

203
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,038
it's a certain substance there's stories

204
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,620
there's there's so much to it yeah

205
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,879
there's a lot to it um you're talking

206
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,060
about like going into the communities

207
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,159
and looking up fermented uh different

208
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,259
fermented drinks that's fascinating man

209
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,660
like what yeah well can you give us an

210
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,720
example like bang is that like do they

211
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,520
make fermented bang and stuff like that

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,919
um well you know I've actually never

213
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,240
seen uh fermented bangs

214
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,120
um it's not definitely not out of the

215
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,278
bounds of the imagination no you know we

216
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,560
we're looking at doing in this

217
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:44,879
particular context sort of pre-colonial

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,518
Indian and Thai recipes and wandering at

219
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,899
our intellectual dishonesty at charging

220
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,639
really high prices for French wine

221
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,580
pairings with that you know yeah yeah of

222
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,860
course and so it was a matter of yeah

223
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,300
trying to find you know different sort

224
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,980
of unique things which we could bring

225
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,899
that value element to the to the

226
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,600
customer to the person consuming the

227
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,820
beverage of yours a complex drink with a

228
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,139
good taste and a story there's quite a

229
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,720
lot of them around but unfortunately we

230
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,838
don't really find them so much in the

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,300
big sort of urban city context where

232
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,160
Bank might be consumed you know and bang

233
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,199
is a regulated good so it's sold in the

234
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,139
government shops you can find it outside

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,399
of course but uh primarily it at least I

236
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,620
associate it with a bit more of an urban

237
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,860
context whereas the drinks we were more

238
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,778
in tatiskar and jharkhand in orisa in

239
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,100
the tribal regions

240
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:36,480
um you know mostly grains rice

241
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,759
one of my favorites in Thailand is

242
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,580
called Sato there's different forms but

243
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,100
essentially it's a glutenous rice with a

244
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,320
little yeast cake called lupang which is

245
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,440
made from a bunch of different local

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,860
herbs and essentially you get a little

247
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,380
clay pot and you add your your rice and

248
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,580
then your your lupang and your water you

249
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:58,139
fill it up with a little bit of water

250
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,899
and then you seal it off the top of the

251
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,939
jar is sealed off with clay and that'll

252
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,580
be left for a few days and you can just

253
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,200
burst there's like a bamboo straw you

254
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,940
burst the clay seal and you just pop it

255
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,720
straight in and drink right out of it

256
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,080
and

257
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,259
got the most wonderful like sour uh

258
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,940
funky fermentation Aroma frankly

259
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,799
um and you know that provided a really

260
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,839
solid base which experiment with

261
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,759
infusing different you know flavors into

262
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,019
it making it sparkling that kind of

263
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,679
thing

264
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,899
um you know I mean the the equivalent of

265
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,458
you know a really expensive wine if it's

266
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,740
something going to be like you know

267
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,319
traditional there's a lot of racism in

268
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,000
the world of food and you know Thai food

269
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,360
Indian food is very often looked down

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,039
upon and so for it to sort of be valued

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,839
as an equivalent by something like a

272
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,319
Michelin inspector it needs to really be

273
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:53,399
sort of yeah yeah I bet

274
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,360
so as a sommelier did you guys uh did a

275
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,740
lot of the experience with like

276
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,000
chirpings and stuff cross over into

277
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,940
cannabis

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,078
yeah at the end in my last job that was

279
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,079
something that we were playing with

280
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:06,479
quite a lot the last two jobs actually

281
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,699
um I was uh I was the beverage director

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,500
for a group which included some cocktail

283
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,660
bars and a couple of restaurants in

284
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,120
Bangkok and they were very sort of

285
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:18,179
progressive and open-minded one of the

286
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,879
owners smoked a lot of weight

287
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,099
um and so it was a little bit easier to

288
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,720
sort of Swing those things however we

289
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,339
weren't able to actually roll it out in

290
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,920
the dining room because it was before

291
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,720
the legalization yeah and despite you

292
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,639
know terpenes not having any cannabis

293
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
it's not the sort of attention that any

294
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,980
sort of restaurant was looking for at

295
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,778
that time

296
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,360
um but we were playing with it because

297
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,320
you know apart from the fermented

298
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,120
beverages they're talking about they

299
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
have alcohol in them and there's a lot

300
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,940
of people who don't consume alcohol in

301
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,799
Asia and so

302
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,680
um we were looking yeah much more at

303
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,479
doing stuff with tea uh Botanicals of

304
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,578
which you know terpenes

305
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,778
um key component in almost any that you

306
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,879
look at

307
00:11:54,778 --> 00:12:00,120
um so as a stoner I'm always interested

308
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,399
in sort of you know finding some OG Kush

309
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,500
taste and some mad tea from somewhere or

310
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,078
something like that you know yeah of

311
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,639
course as you got into the Asian

312
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,278
political sphere and you started making

313
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,220
these connections and inroads what got

314
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,379
you then to move from maybe

315
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,540
um as much of a preservation of Thailand

316
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,000
races which was really you know the main

317
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,620
starting goal into working with the

318
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,839
farmers and making sure the farmers are

319
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,700
absolutely taken care of

320
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,260
I see those two things as absolutely

321
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,259
synonymous that's beautiful

322
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,939
um yeah I mean I I can go in more into

323
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,639
detail if you'd like but please do well

324
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,860
there's a lot of conservation

325
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,740
um I see people tagging their indoor

326
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,180
grows as preservation runs

327
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:50,820
um you know and the thing with zoos is

328
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,099
that they're pretty big entities that

329
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,220
require a lot of coordination and moving

330
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,259
parts and until the Advent of pretty

331
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,139
strict regulations

332
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,720
um and even despite that they can be

333
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,360
pretty dark places

334
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,379
and so

335
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,500
when I think of exit to conservation I

336
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:15,419
think of yeah little amateur zoos

337
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,320
um it's a noble effort but ultimately

338
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,338
the only people who can grow

339
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,680
significant populations of open

340
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,480
pollinated cannabis

341
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,759
um from Land race genetics

342
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,980
is people in the traditional land race

343
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,259
growing regions I mean they don't have

344
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,778
to contend or at least for now with all

345
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,419
of the licenses that's needed in in the

346
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:38,879
west or in North America and Europe

347
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:40,319
um they don't need to contend at least

348
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,778
until recently they didn't need to

349
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,180
contend with hemp Farms or contamination

350
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:47,759
those kinds of things and so

351
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,319
I'm hesitant to say that no preservation

352
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,078
can be done outside because I think it's

353
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,740
pretty obvious that it can but at this

354
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,359
point the focus seems to be so much on

355
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,700
um getting seeds out of the traditional

356
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,639
growing regions and into cryogenic

357
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,920
storage or into long-term you know

358
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,740
growing facilities and there's not much

359
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,659
thought going into actually just helping

360
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,579
out the farmers who are growing land

361
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:13,620
races in the traditional growing region

362
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:15,838
and keeping them growing these

363
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,600
traditional yeah like yeah they're

364
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,220
already doing it like and the problem so

365
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm playing a lot of places including in

366
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,259
Thailand

367
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,060
um people are coming all over and

368
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,559
they're like oh well listen like we need

369
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,059
to teach these guys how to be more

370
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,859
profitable so they can sort of keep up

371
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,539
with the modern industry blah blah blah

372
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,419
blah this is not the solution answer

373
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:36,299
sorry this is not a solution either yeah

374
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,458
um by modernizing and changing either

375
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,519
the target of their growth for example

376
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:43,739
to move away from tariffs to trisift and

377
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,019
bubble hashes and Parvati and other

378
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,820
places this changes the way that the

379
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,440
selections are made and despite being

380
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,240
maybe quite subtle

381
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,459
um they have long lasting consequences

382
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,919
you know and so ultimately we'd be

383
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:59,638
looking at providing essentially a

384
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,740
subsidy for Growers that are growing a

385
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,259
product which unfortunately is not

386
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,240
profitable in the modern Marketplace but

387
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,720
has significant value for the community

388
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,299
and Industry as a whole yeah um and you

389
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,980
know giving them that incentive to make

390
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,740
the choice to grow these land races

391
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,639
despite the disadvantages that are you

392
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,500
know created by legislation policy Etc

393
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,419
um you know because ultimately everybody

394
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,240
has families to take care of and you

395
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,458
know wants to eat and so when faced with

396
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,259
a choice of or not necessarily the

397
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:34,039
choice when faced with having a

398
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:37,078
long-standing land race grow

399
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:39,179
no more customers and knowing that all

400
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,099
it would take is to switch to a modern

401
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,019
cultivar for your Market to suddenly

402
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,820
open up you know that's that's a choice

403
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,259
which almost every land race farmer is

404
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,278
facing today and we need to give them a

405
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,259
reason to

406
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,179
if you like hybrids let's you know keep

407
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,799
doing what we're doing

408
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,179
um yeah it kind of reminds me a little

409
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,539
bit of The multi-state Operators

410
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,379
dropping the prices you know below

411
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,740
um

412
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,360
a sustainable uh you know price yeah for

413
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,539
producing yeah because they can afford

414
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,100
to sustain that and take that loss

415
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,759
yeah exactly so it kind of feels like

416
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,019
the same

417
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,639
land race farm

418
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,259
everybody sort of recognizes

419
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,659
it is what they have but nobody's really

420
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:17,698
willing to actually hook them up or even

421
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:19,259
able really to buy their products and so

422
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,059
it's just kind of going to disappear in

423
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,838
the meantime and that's what we hope

424
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:27,000
hope to address and to to redress and so

425
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,519
what we do essentially is we approach

426
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,799
the it depends who we're approaching and

427
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,778
when but if we can we're approaching the

428
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,399
the community as a whole

429
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:38,220
um the the village elder or Village

430
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,539
Chief or whatever the equivalent is and

431
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,540
you know coming up with some sort of

432
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:45,000
agreement for them to continue growing

433
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,399
land races and for us to to make an

434
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,078
attempt at you know offering their

435
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,059
germplasm

436
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:55,620
um and seeds to to the International

437
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:58,319
Community with for which to breed with

438
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,480
um the idea is that you know people back

439
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,000
home don't need to be concerned with

440
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,400
conservation if we actually let the pros

441
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,019
take care of it in a way and then they

442
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,900
can have fun creating all the crazy

443
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:12,418
hybrids from the final hunt which can be

444
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,160
done each year in such a of you know

445
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,380
genetically diverse population right

446
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,199
yeah

447
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,520
yeah so that's the way we see it that's

448
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,620
amazing man

449
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,418
um the the whole the whole way that you

450
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,399
approach it is very I don't know just

451
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,959
socially conscious to me and I and it's

452
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,160
something that's been lacking a lot in

453
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,600
cannabis

454
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,080
um I think a lot of people that I've

455
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,000
I've seen over the years tend to maybe I

456
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,558
don't want to say exploit the farmers

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,179
but it's hard to say anything other than

458
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,160
that because they they try to get the

459
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,259
cheapest absolute price so that they can

460
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,580
then take a cut off the seeds over the

461
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,038
top and that's how they make their money

462
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:49,139
you know but back it all goes back to

463
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,879
what is the incentive for the farmers to

464
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,580
keep growing these when people come to

465
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,340
them like uh without using any names

466
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:58,319
like a big Seed Company you know from

467
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,240
Amsterdam that says hey we'd rather you

468
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,798
have you you know you give us your land

469
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,298
races we'll store these in German flag

470
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,460
you can grow some of these feminized

471
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:08,819
seeds in the meantime you know like this

472
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,579
is how this is how things disappear for

473
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:13,558
good and uh I appreciate your work on it

474
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,859
hey look I mean I I don't think that

475
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,960
we're going to be able to to prevent is

476
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,119
going extinct unfortunately but we'll

477
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,500
definitely do what we can with you know

478
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,079
the communities that are willing to work

479
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,538
with us to to try and keep what we can

480
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,699
for as long as we can but ultimately

481
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:32,160
it's going to require a concerted effort

482
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,620
on behalf of the entire Community

483
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,700
um ultimately there needs to be a demand

484
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,798
for tejuana driven products and a clear

485
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,558
understanding of what theof driven

486
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,179
products are ultimately I think a lot of

487
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,418
people they want to have that experience

488
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:50,640
of the Colombian gold or the Thai stick

489
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,559
that they had back in the day and you

490
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,020
know that was all imported cannabis and

491
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,000
so if we want to return to experiences

492
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,639
like that we need to consider a

493
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,038
normalization of trade since that's so

494
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,020
so far away it seems to make sense to

495
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,839
support the the land race growers in the

496
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:10,019
meantime by breeding with their genetics

497
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,519
so let's define land race as you see it

498
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,160
as you understand it because that's

499
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,160
super important

500
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:19,080
you know I I I hate to do that actually

501
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,820
because

502
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,899
um but I don't hate to do it but I just

503
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,659
think that

504
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,480
um there's a lot of uh opinions and a

505
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,700
lot of oh sure words out there

506
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,160
um I don't see why we need to reinvent

507
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,900
the wheel every time you know like it's

508
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,500
my take

509
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,559
um is not as as interesting or I think

510
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,940
um as accurate as the numerous studies

511
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,319
which have been published over the last

512
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,240
few decades

513
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,839
um you know dealing with land races and

514
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,679
also specifically defining land races so

515
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,959
um

516
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,759
I would say that um I can actually

517
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,919
remember the name of the authors of the

518
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,700
paper right now there's a paper called

519
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,140
towards an evolved concept of land races

520
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,019
which

521
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,700
um basically

522
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:08,519
it's looking at the history of the

523
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,919
definition of the term and making a

524
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:14,400
proposal that land races should be

525
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,740
considered as basically in Dynamic

526
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,900
populations

527
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,058
which can be subjected to introgression

528
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,460
while still retaining their designation

529
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:25,619
as land races interesting and that's

530
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,679
important because the earliest

531
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:33,178
definitions of land race on grunker for

532
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:36,179
example but even you know until seven

533
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:39,360
which I think was 1998

534
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:43,880
um were much more about static

535
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:46,500
um you know the land races uh monolithic

536
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,080
never-changing thing right yeah and if

537
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,058
it becomes polluted it's gone and if

538
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,279
that's the case then they're destined

539
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:54,480
for the museum and they'll never you

540
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,980
know that's not my that's a quote from

541
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,298
the paper you know they'll yeah they'll

542
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,798
never get out

543
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,660
so

544
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,400
in one sense that makes a lot of sense

545
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,640
on one side that makes a lot of sense to

546
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,820
me on the other I think that the

547
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,460
implication of this sort of evolved

548
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:13,139
understanding of land races

549
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,779
um is

550
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,520
is underlined by a world view or sorry

551
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,759
maybe sort of a structured by a

552
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,918
worldview which cannot consider a future

553
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,460
where indigenous people might be sort of

554
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,860
left in peace to grow alone you know

555
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,900
like the paper can't even consider that

556
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,038
which bothers me fundamentally because

557
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,559
as

558
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,658
a naive dreamer I suppose I'd like to

559
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,538
imagine a future where you know

560
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:41,340
everybody could be left alone yeah

561
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:44,158
I suppose that is somewhat unrealistic

562
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:46,259
so you know given the context the

563
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,740
capitalism will continue to expand into

564
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:52,079
every single possible Market that it can

565
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,759
land race cannabis in traditional

566
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:57,899
growing regions far away from the

567
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,519
nearest road to City no exception

568
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,440
um you know if that's the case then then

569
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,700
I think that that paper does make a lot

570
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,400
of sense

571
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,558
um if we if we are going to integrate

572
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,559
these communities into the global

573
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,099
economy and their crops into the global

574
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:16,678
economy as Commodities then certainly

575
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:21,719
there needs to be some sort of uh

576
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:24,120
new look at how we Define land races

577
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,339
yeah I would basically say yeah go go

578
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,279
read the studies don't listen to me like

579
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,079
I've got nothing fresh to say on the

580
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,940
definition of land races you know I'm a

581
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,220
bit boring on that I'm happy to defer to

582
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,080
the to the scientists but that's a great

583
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,720
answer because you know some people will

584
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:41,158
insert their their opinions as facts

585
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,679
state it very confidently and that's

586
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,360
that you know and and the real answer is

587
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,620
man just gotta do let's check out the

588
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,959
research and stay up to date with the

589
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,359
research right yeah yeah because it's

590
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,840
changing you know and it has changed

591
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:57,058
um and the way we interpret the study

592
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,980
ourselves you know the I read it you

593
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:00,418
read it and somehow we come up with two

594
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,120
slightly different conclusions you know

595
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,799
so I would rather instead of um because

596
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,639
I see that something that's happening a

597
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,139
lot

598
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,360
um I'm constantly having these

599
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,919
conversations and I feel like instead of

600
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,839
constantly Reinventing the wheel and

601
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,980
giving our opinions as to what the

602
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,538
definitions of these things are we

603
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,519
should maybe be doing more reading as a

604
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,919
community and and seeing what you know

605
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,298
the biologists have to say about land

606
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,640
races because there's a lot of work done

607
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:26,038
for foreign land races for weeds Etc

608
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,400
yeah and despite the fact that there's

609
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,900
very few cannabis specific studies

610
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,259
there's a lot of studies on similar

611
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:37,140
organisms hops Etc we can learn a lot

612
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:39,720
from yeah so people that are watching

613
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,159
this probably one of the reasons they're

614
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,740
going to come to watch a show about

615
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,500
Thailand races and and we talked about

616
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,240
this yesterday what is the chocolate tie

617
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,359
it's always the first question I get

618
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,579
I've worked with a line called chocolate

619
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,019
type from a dude named Dro who

620
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:57,298
supposedly sourced it from the people

621
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,400
that DNA down in there and sourced it

622
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:02,000
from to make chocolate back in the day

623
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:06,600
there's of course all these fantastic

624
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,859
Legends and fables of Pasa dipped you

625
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:13,079
know heroin infused cannabis there's all

626
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,879
these Tales of what chocolate Thai is in

627
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,599
your experience what do you learn about

628
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,600
chocolate pie

629
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:23,158
um very very little and I think that's

630
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,280
the the message here is that

631
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:29,159
um in Thailand the area which produced

632
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,079
cannabis the largest area isan

633
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,500
um was incredibly like really really

634
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,658
poor until quite recently and the idea

635
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,298
that farmers were sort of walking around

636
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,820
eating Nestle chocolate and naming

637
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:43,319
things I mean not saying that no one had

638
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:47,579
ever heard of chocolate in Nissan in the

639
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:49,619
70s but it's an English word and it's in

640
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:52,500
my opinion a pretty sort of pretty

641
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,678
clearly it's foreigners who you know had

642
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,679
some accession or selection

643
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:00,179
or bags of weed with some seeds in it

644
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,940
you know

645
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,380
um and they had you know a chocolate I

646
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,419
really because I really can't speak on

647
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,820
DNA or anything like that at all I can

648
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:11,100
think of is you know having gone through

649
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,619
the motions myself asking pretty much

650
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:15,658
everybody that I can you know deal with

651
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,418
chocolate Thai and you know being met

652
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,919
with the same thing one issue is that

653
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,220
um a lot of the traditional knowledge

654
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,500
here in Thailand has sort of slowly been

655
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,538
sort of dissipating and becoming

656
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,460
unstructured and a lot of the youngins

657
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:31,379
are learning from the same sources that

658
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,200
we are and so you'll meet some

659
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,900
especially ethnic pie like they'll be

660
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,120
maybe aware of chocolate Thai and maybe

661
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,038
if you rocked up to Thailand and a few

662
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,239
years ago and you asked for it you would

663
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,379
have got something and they would have

664
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,179
told you it was chocolate pie I don't

665
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,500
know

666
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,419
um I can't speak for anything like that

667
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,940
but what I can say is that as far as

668
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,320
large open pollinated populations of

669
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,600
cannabis that we could describe as land

670
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,819
race that the farmers are sort of

671
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,980
engaging with and in their head

672
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:01,319
conceiving of as chocolate Thai that

673
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,179
doesn't exist as far as unaware of

674
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:06,918
um what I can say though

675
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,919
um to give people some some hope

676
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,960
yeah exactly exactly is that

677
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,259
um the

678
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,700
the aroma of chocolate also that of

679
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:23,519
coffee dark earthy musty Aromas are very

680
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,440
typical of narrow Leaf drug type land

681
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,019
race when it's been subjected to

682
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,919
compression curing which I think a lot

683
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:35,099
of you will know is Thai sticks and so

684
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,500
um I guess when you have this sort of

685
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:41,459
um this mechanical pressure plus

686
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:44,759
temperature plus time we see significant

687
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,940
impact on the terpene profiles when we

688
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:50,158
can add anaerobic conditions on occasion

689
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,759
aging underground or these days in

690
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,559
vacuum seals we do see some pretty funky

691
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,259
Aromas coming out of it but one thing

692
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:01,200
that's quite consistent is a sort of

693
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,058
earthy chocolatey character

694
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,120
um that's something that I've I've had a

695
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:08,339
lot in my time in Southeast Asia in Laos

696
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:11,158
in Cambodia and Myanmar and elsewhere

697
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,678
with the older you know six month plus

698
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,419
Europe staff and so

699
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,860
I don't want to speculate too much but I

700
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,778
think it would be interesting if it

701
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,038
turned out to be some sort of uh you

702
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,079
know terpene

703
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,179
um which which was sort of maybe about

704
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,699
synthesized

705
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:28,620
um during this aging process

706
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,960
um and you know who's leading to that it

707
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:32,579
could also be a combination of different

708
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,558
compounds which are leading to this

709
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:36,480
smell but uh yeah there's definitely

710
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,278
something to to research there and I

711
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,620
think for those interested in the

712
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:44,038
chocolate pie your best bet is the final

713
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,839
hunt the the Lao isanjinpu and so for

714
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:49,379
that you can approach squirrel tail

715
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,178
Tiger Tail Thai mango snake teeth

716
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,679
um a bunch of other stuff

717
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,120
um and you know you'll find pretty

718
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,559
consistently you know applying these

719
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,359
compassion curing techniques that you'll

720
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,678
have these chocolate Aromas they're

721
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,240
delicious by the way

722
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,480
um if you nail it you're looking at a

723
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,859
slow degradation of the chlorophyll

724
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,038
leaving almost everything else intact

725
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:10,019
and so you've got a very smooth smoke

726
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,940
which doesn't have this sort of Full

727
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,038
Green character which chlorophyll brings

728
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,200
which is so ubiquitous the smoking

729
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:17,278
cannabis flower and I'll say as a note

730
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,400
that

731
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,960
um you know just as sort of curiosity a

732
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,538
couple times we've had some some

733
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,100
professional similes coming into our our

734
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,798
we're partnered with a dispensary in

735
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:31,619
Bangkok and they have a total of 64

736
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,538
trains in the in the in the shop front

737
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:35,158
now and we let all the summer there

738
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:37,440
smell them and they're like yeah next

739
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,600
next next next next they get to the

740
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,659
compression cured Lao gold land race and

741
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,980
they're like oh what's this because it's

742
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,080
the only one that doesn't smell green

743
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,298
yeah and doesn't have that chlorophyll

744
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,220
and then wine green is an aroma that's

745
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:54,298
very sort of uh we

746
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:57,240
yeah it's viewed as a flaw almost yeah

747
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:58,619
almost universally and so yeah I think

748
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,058
that there's there's something to be

749
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,819
explored there and I think that there's

750
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:05,639
a reason why so many people are in love

751
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,558
with this chocolate pie with the myth of

752
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,759
it with the story because there is

753
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,278
something there that's you know

754
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,859
rewarding delicious

755
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,859
um I just don't think it's a strain a

756
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:18,479
strain it's a proper yeah yeah yeah I

757
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:22,439
know what's interesting is growing up

758
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,620
here and in in the 90s earlier that 90s

759
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,798
uh getting a lot of Mexican compressed

760
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:30,479
Rick constant and in that Mexican

761
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,519
compressed brick I've always said it

762
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,399
smelled like minty chocolate but

763
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,440
definitely a cocoa type smell and I

764
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,500
would I mean it was compression

765
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,940
cured and sat forever so it it kind of

766
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,058
you know speaks to what you're talking

767
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,340
about very very very interesting

768
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:51,418
um you mentioned of course the the

769
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:53,038
infamous Tiger Tail squirrel tail can we

770
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,679
start talking about some of these

771
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,658
different uh what you would call like

772
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,340
maybe an expression of these different

773
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:03,539
land races or yeah yeah sure so

774
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,538
um

775
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:08,220
it's gone really confusing and that's

776
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:11,158
the picture that I'm trying to paint

777
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,720
yeah um the way I'm explaining it it's

778
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,399
probably going to be a bit confused and

779
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,159
what I'm explaining is very confusing

780
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:20,219
yeah um essentially

781
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,740
the first attestation to the word

782
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,980
squirrel tail in allow script

783
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,099
um that we saw was in reference to

784
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,798
um traditional tip weaving which is a

785
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:34,019
style or a better squirrel tail is a

786
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:36,960
pattern found in traditional kit weaving

787
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,418
which today is practiced in silk and I

788
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,079
think one day I'd like to find if I can

789
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:45,000
a traditional Thai fist or you know a

790
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,980
weaving historian if that exists oh

791
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,740
right did they did they make it with

792
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,440
hemp because that would be my interest

793
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,419
to be a hunch yeah I mean squirrel tail

794
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,820
the Tiger Tail

795
00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:02,759
um these are many things

796
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:04,918
um it's all down to the the Lao isan we

797
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:08,278
can call it so on both sides of the

798
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:11,580
Mekong in Thailand and Laos live

799
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:13,440
speakers in the Thai side it's referred

800
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,599
to as a region as isan or the Korat

801
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,480
plateau and

802
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,519
essentially

803
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:24,360
the words that are used to describe

804
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:27,058
cannabis of a certain archetype

805
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:29,158
um or squirrel tail tiger Tails Tetris

806
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:31,980
so squirrel tail describes like a big

807
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,200
like cheerleader like Pom-Pom style but

808
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,380
you know like really like

809
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:41,580
yeah not to leave very puffy and then

810
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,559
the Tiger Tail is the it's more like the

811
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:44,819
the creeper I've heard it referred to in

812
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:47,940
English as a Creeper stuff that makes

813
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:50,278
sense like Robert describe creepers

814
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,038
I think so yes you have a lot of lateral

815
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:55,259
branching low to the ground with these

816
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:59,220
these branches sometimes forming new

817
00:31:55,259 --> 00:32:02,099
roots and then big swoopy main colas and

818
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,200
strangely the English translation

819
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:07,199
um for Tiger Tail is sometimes rendered

820
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,240
as Rudder and I'm not sure who got

821
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,759
confused the English speakers of the

822
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,980
Thai but some of the ties have also been

823
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,819
telling me that no this is Rudder as in

824
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,819
like

825
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:20,759
boat Roger uh yeah something they'd be

826
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:23,038
most used to seeing I don't know but in

827
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,919
that sense I was thinking just like a

828
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,240
long upright rigid object but you know

829
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,340
because if you look at some of the Tiger

830
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,038
Tail they really do like they have this

831
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:33,558
huge main top caller and then the the

832
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:35,879
branching's already low to the side

833
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:36,839
there's quite as with a lot of these

834
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,480
things there's a lot of different

835
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,058
stories but so far you know the we were

836
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,819
able to differentiate between the the

837
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:47,339
the the structure on these two

838
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,139
um and then also the structure for the

839
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:51,058
type for the snake teeth

840
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,640
um which is the

841
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:55,558
the vine like growth kind of like Dr

842
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,720
grinspoon where you have a running

843
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,319
cowlick structure

844
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,298
um and then the mango or would be the

845
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,099
you know the mercy enrich

846
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,558
um accessions

847
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:10,019
um but it's also pretty common to find

848
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:14,099
mango Aromas in Squirrel tail tiger

849
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:16,980
tails and the snake teeth so ultimately

850
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:20,278
I think that originally it would have

851
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:23,220
been a singular gene pool which during

852
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:27,000
its dissemination and the cross-cultural

853
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,278
contact between the thighs the Lao and

854
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,619
other groups in the region

855
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:35,640
um seeds were exchanged planets were

856
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:37,739
exchanged and we ended up with both

857
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,659
autoctonus

858
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,538
um you know land race populations big

859
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,820
open pollinated populations

860
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,379
um sorry optometrist and allotones in

861
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:49,500
different regions

862
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,760
um a bunch of inbred lines some single

863
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,319
plants

864
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,359
um

865
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:56,759
reproductions from Single Seeds you know

866
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:59,699
multiply it into millions and then

867
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,158
disseminated and then it's a mess and a

868
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,399
lot of them carry the same names

869
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,260
um so I think it's best understood you

870
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,118
know as

871
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:11,699
archetypes within the gene pool but have

872
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,480
since become established as their own

873
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:19,858
land races and in some cases more like

874
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,740
modern strains as in ibls yeah yeah and

875
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:25,139
all of them coexisting uh temporally and

876
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,598
geographically in some cases pollinating

877
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,059
each other yeah it's just like really

878
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,659
really complicated

879
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:36,898
um we basically have done our best to

880
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:40,320
I ignore everything that we sort of hear

881
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:42,659
and focus on what we see yeah and look

882
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,879
for large open pollinated populations

883
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,519
that breed true

884
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:50,460
um they seem to have you know

885
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,739
um seemed to express what we consider to

886
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,378
look more like a primordial character

887
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,479
but ultimately as long as the population

888
00:34:55,378 --> 00:35:00,179
size is big enough and it's grown in

889
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,880
open pollination then you know that fits

890
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:05,759
the the base criteria and so we're

891
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,220
looking to collapse from everything but

892
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,099
what we're sort of getting involved in

893
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:13,139
heavily is is what we can determine to

894
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:15,480
be the more I don't want to use the word

895
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:17,358
pure because it's not accurate but the

896
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,639
the stuff which is grown properly

897
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,259
managed properly and not just you know

898
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,420
every single little thing that we can

899
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,900
find because honestly it's a rabbit hole

900
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,180
there's at this point since legalization

901
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,400
every single Uncle you know whoever had

902
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:34,319
a single plant in his back Garden making

903
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,940
seeds and selling them

904
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,820
um giving them away you know people are

905
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,039
selling clothes for about 30 cents a

906
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,660
clone on the side of the street in in

907
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,000
Bangkok out a little trucks and stuff

908
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:48,059
and so I believe there's this really

909
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,460
intense sort of mixing and hybridization

910
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:52,019
of everything going on at the moment but

911
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,099
that's just sort of the culmination of

912
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:55,159
the last

913
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,780
um 40 50 years and so as far as the

914
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:59,759
laoisan gene pool is concerned

915
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,380
um we've been looking at plants that you

916
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,380
know look like a squirrel tail look like

917
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,539
a Tiger Tail and our captain big open

918
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,519
pollinated growth in Fairly remote

919
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,619
regions where we can and basically

920
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,820
that's taken us out of isan for the most

921
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,160
part

922
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,680
um and into the into the more hilly

923
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,779
regions where you can find that

924
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:22,078
you know we can get that distance that's

925
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,079
required to you know to totally prevent

926
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,859
the the cross-contamination

927
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,660
so you've done you've done a lot of work

928
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:33,239
in Thailand to you know try to pick

929
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,039
apart a lot of these stories and over

930
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,779
time it seems like zomi is kind of

931
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,519
spread out a little bit are there any

932
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,320
other areas that you you've been really

933
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,119
excited about that you've been looking

934
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,099
into I mean you talk about you know

935
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,800
around Thailand there's you know

936
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,599
Cambodia Laos Myanmar are there other

937
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,640
places in there that you're excited

938
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,859
about or elsewhere

939
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,379
yeah absolutely

940
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:57,179
um Cambodia is you know the place that I

941
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,000
spent the most time personally so I have

942
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,219
a really soft spot for for Cambodia and

943
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,199
a lot of my best friends or or Cambodian

944
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:06,480
people that you know they were little

945
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,879
rascals and now they're big Rascals and

946
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,760
we're looking forward to being able to

947
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,440
to return there probably this year and

948
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
look at what we can do to expand our

949
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,380
collection

950
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,539
um try and see if we can recruit some

951
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,400
some different communities into into the

952
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,619
collective and bring out some new seeds

953
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,139
otherwise Laos you know that's always

954
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,640
one of the most interesting regions

955
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:28,379
um if you're you know the Thai

956
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,960
nationalism prevents them from admitting

957
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,960
how good the Laos and weed is and the

958
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,579
laoshin reverse with the tie they're

959
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,619
both excellent

960
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:41,000
um there's a lot of synergy there

961
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:43,680
um and you know Laos has a few iconic

962
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
areas producing you know land race

963
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,118
cannabis that we're really looking

964
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,699
forward to to go to uh in particular the

965
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,160
the C pandon the the four thousand

966
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:56,338
Islands which is

967
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,899
basically an area of the Mekong where

968
00:37:56,338 --> 00:38:00,480
there's cataracts on the border with

969
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,200
Cambodia and Laos and Mekong spreads out

970
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,300
into these loads of islands and it's a

971
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,919
pretty well known tourist destination a

972
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,380
place where a lot of people have you

973
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,079
know fond memories of kicking back and

974
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,260
fishing and smoking great pot from the

975
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,420
60s onwards and it has you know

976
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,240
there's not a lot of places left on the

977
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,338
Mekong the islands which grow this

978
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:25,500
beautiful golden weed which all the

979
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:27,059
old-timers are looking for and so that's

980
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,800
probably going to be one of the the

981
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,420
priorities in terms of where we're going

982
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,119
to be going around it's not necessarily

983
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,980
grown within the main areas but you know

984
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,720
along the cataracts there's there's a

985
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,740
lot of people growing here and there and

986
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,838
we're looking forward to getting some

987
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:41,399
seeds so yeah golden meekong wheat

988
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,480
blouse that's going to be I think that's

989
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,700
going to be a big hit with the

990
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,139
old-timers but there's a lot of stuff in

991
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:48,419
the north of the Street near the border

992
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:50,219
with unan and then of course the the

993
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,320
Bola Haven Plateau

994
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:55,739
um that's beautiful coffee growing

995
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,480
region with a significant amount of uh

996
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,879
local population belonging to the Lavin

997
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,619
ethnic group who's a very talented

998
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,420
cannabis Growers

999
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,338
um there's so much in Laos that we can

1000
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,079
explore it's really a very very diverse

1001
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:09,900
country very small but with a lot of

1002
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,119
diversity in cannabis and in the people

1003
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,619
the Landscapes and everything Myanmar

1004
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,320
unfortunately is

1005
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,579
um this you know I mean it feels a bit

1006
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,019
silly saying unfortunately in the

1007
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,640
context of seeds because that's not

1008
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,920
really what makes it sad obviously but

1009
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:26,338
me and Mars undergoing you know uh

1010
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,380
severe political upheaval Civil War

1011
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:31,500
um if anybody um

1012
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,420
you know wants to wants to help out

1013
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,539
they're taking Volunteers in Chiang Mai

1014
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,880
right now you can go and uh sign up to

1015
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:40,980
go fight for the for the militias that

1016
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,900
are fighting against the government it's

1017
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,659
it's absolute chaos out there it's been

1018
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,599
getting really really really bad and you

1019
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:49,980
know we we're not doing anything in

1020
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,760
Myanmar right now

1021
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,380
um

1022
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,140
yeah it doesn't make any sense it

1023
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,280
doesn't sound so safe right now or or I

1024
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,858
mean people's priorities are different

1025
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,780
right now yeah that's it people's

1026
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:01,980
priorities are different and and we

1027
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,839
don't feel like

1028
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,940
um we've spoken to you know to our

1029
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,159
contacts out there and we theoretically

1030
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,960
could get seeds out but it just again it

1031
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,179
doesn't seem like a priority

1032
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,519
um I think the priority probably seems

1033
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,858
to be for us now to to continue focusing

1034
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,960
on our work in Cambodia Laos

1035
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:22,078
um and in the northeast of India in you

1036
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,199
know mizoram tripura nagaland Etc

1037
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,000
but we're also very very excited to to

1038
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,578
be bringing out some some Colombian

1039
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,800
genetics hopefully soon oh wow

1040
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,780
yeah well we're all very excited about

1041
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,339
that and this is a lot of similarities

1042
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,920
with the tie it seems between you know

1043
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:39,000
the Caribbean and Latin American Gene

1044
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,320
pools

1045
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,260
um we're looking forward to having

1046
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,760
closer collaboration with us and you

1047
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,400
know Growers members of our collective

1048
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,960
in that group and together try to build

1049
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,700
a better picture of you know what's

1050
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,400
going on with the land races between the

1051
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,659
two regions a lot of similarities in the

1052
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,119
in the the sort of setting up

1053
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:58,618
semi-outdoor uh curing styles with

1054
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,160
golden weed as a result that kind of

1055
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:02,820
thing and so

1056
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:06,118
our

1057
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,039
um yeah our boys are based in kalka but

1058
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,200
they're mobile so we're looking forward

1059
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,779
to Bringing out some some genetics from

1060
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,879
there pretty pretty soon

1061
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,640
um pretty sure the next dropped or the

1062
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,059
the current drop is I just we just came

1063
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:23,219
back from from Himachal Pradesh but uh I

1064
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,219
think next is going to be yeah in that

1065
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:28,078
order Thailand Cambodia Laos followed by

1066
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:30,179
followed by India again

1067
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,280
can we talk about some of the current

1068
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:33,779
recent accessions that you got

1069
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,339
um that are on your site right now let's

1070
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,380
talk about some of those so people have

1071
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:39,420
a uh an understanding from you other

1072
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,099
than what you write which is uh like

1073
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,000
that's kind of what initially drew me to

1074
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,320
you you know a good friend of Neville's

1075
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,420
um send me to your son said you've got

1076
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,420
to check these guys out man like this is

1077
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,880
legit and I did and it's not just it's

1078
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,099
not just descriptions like lulling you

1079
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,640
in with you know words and marketing

1080
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,619
it's how you collected it it's how you

1081
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,179
listed the accessions it's done very

1082
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,400
well like in my opinion very

1083
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:07,019
scientifically and all the details that

1084
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,700
people need to know

1085
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,320
um a lot of people will of course Be

1086
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:12,659
Wondering like what is this taste and

1087
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,059
smell like what's a THC content you know

1088
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:17,279
like what's the high yeah and and and

1089
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:18,480
not not understanding that like they're

1090
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,040
thinking of it from a very modern

1091
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,920
mindset of what's this going to be like

1092
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:24,838
in my room indoors and we just it's not

1093
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,599
something you can really tell them you

1094
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,719
know how this plant that grows outdoors

1095
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,039
in in this Expresses in this environment

1096
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,838
now it's going to be indoors in your

1097
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,659
environment where it's never been you

1098
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,578
know so yeah please talk about some of

1099
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:40,799
your your more recent accessions and and

1100
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:44,280
what people can expect

1101
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,200
sure so yeah like uh like you said we

1102
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,140
don't really we don't really put you

1103
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,000
know like expected yields or you know we

1104
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,159
do we do go into terpene profiles a

1105
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,858
little bit but you know not massively

1106
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,539
and certainly not THC percentages or

1107
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:59,279
anything exactly I'd like to know that

1108
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,800
you know we've found some accessions in

1109
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,019
Cambodia which have very few trichome

1110
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,720
heads on them however they absolutely

1111
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:08,940
laugh and so I'm just gonna go ahead and

1112
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,618
go on a limb and say that maybe there's

1113
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,519
even some other kind of annoy to play

1114
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:14,700
there

1115
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,980
um and so you know measuring you know

1116
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:19,679
that strange quality or that accessions

1117
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,858
quality based on its THC percentage just

1118
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,078
seems like an absurdity yeah um there's

1119
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:27,179
so many missing cannabinoids out there

1120
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,460
like that we that aren't tested for we

1121
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:32,159
have no clue what is causing some of

1122
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,420
these highs right right so for as far as

1123
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,598
the most recent exceptions we were in

1124
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,420
Parvati Valley which um is you know one

1125
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,000
of the the true hot spots of land races

1126
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,338
in the world in in India

1127
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,559
um it's maybe not as much of a priority

1128
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:49,440
as far as conservation goes the farmers

1129
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,940
there are pretty pretty well off and

1130
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,980
doing pretty well in fact they don't

1131
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,619
really need our help in the same way

1132
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,838
that farmers in Southeast Asia do but

1133
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:59,700
it's important to us because Parvati is

1134
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,578
one of the most visible one of the most

1135
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:04,500
famous of the growing regions in in the

1136
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,960
whole world and so you know without

1137
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,659
having you know a few pictures and some

1138
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,139
accessions from Milana it's really hard

1139
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:14,879
to have that clout as a you know a land

1140
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:17,759
race Collective you know is that where

1141
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,420
Milana is in Parvati Valley or is it

1142
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,339
called it is yeah yeah it is so is in

1143
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,440
the state of Himachal Pradesh which

1144
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:28,078
basically means like the you know the

1145
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,500
the Himachal Province and machale is

1146
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,560
like a Heavenly Mountain I believe in

1147
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:38,460
and it's the it's you know the the place

1148
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,900
outside of Kathmandu so basically a lot

1149
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,599
of um

1150
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:46,559
Parvati Valley is in is in Himachal

1151
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:49,260
Pradesh which is in the north of India

1152
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,139
near the near the border with with China

1153
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:54,420
and not so far away from Pakistan

1154
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:56,639
kashmirs in between it's in the the

1155
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:00,119
northwest of the of the country

1156
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:03,239
and it's basically a hub for cannabis

1157
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,940
growing since the since the 1960s as one

1158
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,559
of the sort of the tail ends uh of the

1159
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,460
of the hippie Trail you know other than

1160
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,619
do in Nepal and starting I'm not exactly

1161
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:17,159
sure when but you know I would say maybe

1162
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:19,619
late 70s early 80s a lot of Italians I'm

1163
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:21,960
coming to Parvati

1164
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:24,720
um La Paz and Malana villages in

1165
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,579
particular and

1166
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,500
um and getting involved with Charis

1167
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:30,720
production there and so it's had a big

1168
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,639
International reputation

1169
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,239
um and in Europe

1170
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,199
um avati hash is not necessarily the

1171
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,799
most common

1172
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:43,739
but in a lot of places in Italy um in

1173
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,240
the Scandinavian countries is one of the

1174
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:48,118
prestige

1175
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:51,959
um hash that is is available on offer

1176
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:54,900
and so for us it it's it seems like you

1177
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,119
know a very a priority let's say

1178
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,800
basically because you know when

1179
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,539
foreigners are learning and educating

1180
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,339
themselves about land races one of the

1181
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:04,219
first places that they learn about is

1182
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,719
generally

1183
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:09,118
you know Tosh this kind of thing and so

1184
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:12,118
yeah we we felt like in order to bring

1185
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,338
attention to smaller villages in other

1186
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,358
parts of India and in other countries in

1187
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,980
Thailand

1188
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,838
um that it was in the best interest of

1189
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,480
approaching and working with the farmers

1190
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,920
there and so but the farmers there

1191
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,900
they're not the

1192
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,720
conservation is needed everywhere but

1193
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,519
Milana and liminal but Parvati Valley as

1194
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,838
a whole is sort of one of the more

1195
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,239
stable

1196
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,338
um one of the larger land race producing

1197
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,219
regions the people there are holding on

1198
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:40,679
to their Traditions pretty hard

1199
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:42,659
and so it's not necessarily an area

1200
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,699
where we can engage in necessarily the

1201
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:47,219
the same type of conservation work that

1202
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:50,338
we can in tribal regions in the

1203
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,259
northeast of India or elsewhere

1204
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,599
um but it's somewhere where we you know

1205
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,540
could Source some very high quality

1206
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:01,559
seeds from very very famous gardens

1207
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:04,259
maybe you know do our part in helping to

1208
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:05,759
build up the body of knowledge for what

1209
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,520
could eventually be an appellation

1210
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,440
system in the region

1211
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,940
um and you know that that in particular

1212
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,179
is something with it on a personal level

1213
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,280
I'd love to to see happen and you know

1214
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:19,500
it'd be a privilege to be involved in

1215
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,119
anything even remote to that

1216
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,338
um I think Parvati is one of the the

1217
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,460
Grand Cru so to speak of the the

1218
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:30,059
Cannabis world there's a lot of it's a

1219
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,159
storied place with a big diversity of in

1220
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:35,159
French we call them reliodi and Klima

1221
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:38,179
they refer to the smallest Geographic

1222
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:41,039
designation basically individual plots

1223
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:44,219
sometimes having multiple within one

1224
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:48,480
Vineyard and so you know in Parvati we

1225
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:50,399
see a similar system with very small

1226
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,920
individual plots making up a

1227
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,139
constellation that forms a larger sort

1228
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,000
of system that spread throughout the

1229
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:59,818
whole valley and so that provides us

1230
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,159
with a lot of different Expressions

1231
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:04,500
um you know of that gene pool from the

1232
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,078
various sort of terroir of the area

1233
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,179
whether they be the the dark side of the

1234
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:12,480
valley with a lot of humidity a lot of

1235
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:15,299
rain or you know the the best most sunny

1236
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,800
spots at High Altitude above Milano

1237
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,300
Village right and everything in between

1238
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:23,039
and so in total we made 74 accessions

1239
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,560
um which I

1240
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,679
I maybe it's I don't need to but I just

1241
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:31,400
want to point out like how much tracking

1242
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:31,399
was involved

1243
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:39,358
you know Gardens that are uh you know

1244
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:40,019
between let's say 2 100 to 3

1245
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,259
000

1246
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:46,380
4 000 meters basically at the highest so

1247
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,660
um between well like six thousand to to

1248
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,940
almost 12 000 feet

1249
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,858
um and a lot of The Villages for example

1250
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,780
uh Tosh

1251
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:56,039
um maybe I don't actually know the exact

1252
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,060
outside

1253
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:02,400
um the result is 2600 or so

1254
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:05,338
um and the provide Ram Fields above it

1255
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,519
are hitting 3 000 right and so yeah you

1256
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:11,099
need to get up to Russell and then up to

1257
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,659
the fields Beyond so similarly to in

1258
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,579
Southeast Asia we're next to the rice

1259
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,899
fields there's these little Huts where

1260
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,220
they dry out

1261
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,119
um a lot of the products and where they

1262
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,980
rest

1263
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,140
during the hot parts of the day there's

1264
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,960
rubbing houses in a lot of the higher

1265
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:27,179
fields in Parvati and so a lot of the

1266
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,280
time we were hanging out with the boys

1267
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:30,299
there and asking them you know like you

1268
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,339
know what's the name of this Garden

1269
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,140
what's the name of that Garden you know

1270
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:36,239
can you make sure you separate plants

1271
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:39,420
from those two next time you rub we'll

1272
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,379
we'll give you more money yeah honestly

1273
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,400
they do

1274
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,660
they think they're like why would the

1275
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Foreigner pay more

1276
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:47,818
for knowing that it comes from one

1277
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,619
garden and not the other remember let's

1278
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:53,279
put some [ __ ] stamps on the Charis

1279
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:55,380
and uh yeah right that's very Western

1280
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,760
mentality and

1281
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,619
um I think but I think it's it's

1282
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,880
rewarding and it helps it helps the

1283
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,800
farmers differentiate their product

1284
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,760
without having any change on the product

1285
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,039
itself and you know it helps us again to

1286
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,900
to bring a better clearer picture of

1287
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,960
what is going on in the gene pool in

1288
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,740
that area and to represent that visually

1289
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,900
a text and with our seats

1290
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:20,578
I'm really excited about that um you

1291
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,318
were telling a story yesterday about

1292
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:24,119
hand rubbing that I thought was

1293
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,079
fascinating and like the one thing that

1294
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:29,640
like

1295
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:32,280
as as a person you might have a few ocds

1296
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:34,980
um like the idea of hand rubbing like to

1297
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,380
me is is skin cells and stuff like that

1298
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,380
like that drives me nuts but I

1299
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:43,440
understand the tradition and the quality

1300
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,420
that goes along with this and you had an

1301
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,039
interesting story about like how bad it

1302
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,539
can screw up your hands

1303
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,099
um can you tell me a little bit about

1304
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:52,199
that so people can understand what goes

1305
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,059
into this yeah

1306
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:56,639
um I'm actually what I didn't mean to

1307
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:58,680
emphasize that honestly like the I think

1308
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,279
the eyelashes are more of a concern than

1309
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:04,199
this really yeah yeah because you like

1310
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,359
you'll never even really see the skin

1311
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,759
cell you'll just notice that your hands

1312
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,078
feel a bit papery and thin right and

1313
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,819
then you know if you let them dry out

1314
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,680
afterwards they'll get all ragged but

1315
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:16,139
yeah you'll often notice little

1316
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,960
eyelashes because they're always hunched

1317
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,460
over when they're oh yeah yeah or when

1318
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,740
they're rubbing so

1319
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,480
um basically you know everybody all the

1320
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,039
foreigners they come up to Parvati for

1321
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,659
the first time and they have it in their

1322
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:29,219
head that they're gonna you know run

1323
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:31,829
naked through the field of weed maybe

1324
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:34,919
yeah something like that right yeah

1325
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:34,920
[Music]

1326
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,960
and then I also want to say before I

1327
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:41,699
before we say anything else you know

1328
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,500
because a lot of these conversations in

1329
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:45,719
the past have led to people going to

1330
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,880
where we've talked about on the back of

1331
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,739
me explaining where the grows are if you

1332
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,680
go to Milano Valley and you touch any

1333
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:54,539
plants expect to pay about a 500 fine

1334
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,118
for every plant that you touch every

1335
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:59,219
time you touch one they are not so keen

1336
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,019
on foreigners coming in and but in other

1337
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,699
places in the job you can yeah probably

1338
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:06,539
run naked through the fields as you

1339
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:08,519
imagine you could it could and um you

1340
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:10,380
know the the first thing is like okay

1341
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:12,599
well I'm not gonna buy hash while I'm

1342
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,039
here because I'm a cannabis nerd and I

1343
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,400
know how it's made so I'm gonna rub it

1344
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:19,440
myself yeah early and you go up and you

1345
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,960
rub and you rub and you'll notice that

1346
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,760
unless you're doing this regularly it

1347
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,400
takes a big toll on your hands the

1348
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,380
terpenes are somewhat caustic and you're

1349
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,119
applying a lot of pressure onto your

1350
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,579
palms and specifically when you're

1351
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,400
collecting the matter at the end you're

1352
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:37,440
pressing your thumb not only is it

1353
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,139
pretty bad on your our joints pretty

1354
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,639
quickly but you'll notice blisters on

1355
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:42,838
your thumb if your Technique isn't on

1356
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,879
point

1357
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:46,739
um so I think that yeah for people who

1358
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,960
have these kind of like uh you know

1359
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:50,279
whether it's OCD or just you know being

1360
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,338
concerned about hygiene which is

1361
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,900
reasonable you know I get yeah yeah

1362
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:56,940
I can't even see the skin cells but like

1363
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,280
even when I when I'm like doing that at

1364
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,099
home like going through picking seeds

1365
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,019
and I've got like caked caked or resin

1366
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,940
on my hands I'm thinking but if I smoke

1367
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:07,318
this

1368
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:10,800
it's not really going to be perfect you

1369
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:13,619
know but yeah also also

1370
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:17,579
knowing about melodic cream that is like

1371
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:20,280
in my mind like supposed to be what the

1372
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:22,980
ultimate hash what I understand melonic

1373
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,839
cream so that's like there's no way any

1374
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,719
skin cell would make me pass up some

1375
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,400
melanocrine to try you know the top

1376
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:31,199
level cream will have very few skin

1377
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,119
cells in it because the whole point of

1378
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:36,960
cream is for it to be very delicately

1379
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:39,358
rubbed yes um and so when you do rub it

1380
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,699
delicately there's you know and also

1381
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,739
we're talking about you know for for

1382
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:45,179
someone with soft hands who doesn't rub

1383
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:46,439
every year then yeah it's going to be

1384
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,019
filled with skin that's a good point

1385
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,838
whatever your calloused hand not so much

1386
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:53,759
yeah yeah

1387
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,799
um I will say though that during the

1388
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,339
season you'll find the whole village is

1389
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:02,280
empties and you know

1390
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:04,139
in a way you could child exploitation or

1391
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,579
whatever but I mean I mean it's not

1392
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:07,078
really like they have such thing as

1393
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,059
child care up in the hills either

1394
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,680
exactly they'll leave the kids at home

1395
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:15,000
yeah they come with and the whole family

1396
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:18,239
rubs and you better believe that the dad

1397
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,858
is gonna tell you later like yo this is

1398
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,239
my 16 year old daughter who rubbed this

1399
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:23,519
her hands are really soft you can pay

1400
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,139
more for this you know oh I bet yeah you

1401
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:26,818
do that they're always like no no this

1402
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:28,980
is the youngest you know the this is my

1403
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:32,219
wife or it's always the wife daughter

1404
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:35,159
who's gets the highest prices that's

1405
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:37,739
funny very typical though yeah yeah yeah

1406
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:41,399
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1407
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:43,558
so is there like you mentioned Colombia

1408
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,720
is there any other like pie in the sky

1409
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,579
like ideas you want to pull off with

1410
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:49,019
omia that you haven't yet

1411
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:51,740
yeah

1412
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:55,079
um we'd like to I mean

1413
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:57,479
a lot of things we'd love to to get more

1414
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:01,680
into the production uh and aging and

1415
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,940
then selling of Thai stick and Charis

1416
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:04,618
um those are what we're passionate about

1417
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,300
traditional compression curing and

1418
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:09,300
traditional hand rubbing you know the

1419
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,079
the artisanal craft which don't involve

1420
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,339
the mediation of many tools or Machinery

1421
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,839
in the elaboration of traditional

1422
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:16,920
cannabis products that's always going to

1423
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,019
be something that we want to get

1424
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,460
involved in so I just maybe if you'll

1425
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:21,719
allow me want to go back a little bit to

1426
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,039
Milana

1427
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,078
um oh man

1428
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,219
yeah no I think I think that there's a

1429
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,180
bit more Nuance that needs to be

1430
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:29,179
explained here sure

1431
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,859
the cream the Charis is rubbed from

1432
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:36,960
domesticate plants

1433
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:39,179
um which over the course of the last 25

1434
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,920
years in particular every single farmer

1435
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:43,618
who has been around long enough to see

1436
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,440
it talks about a decline in THC levels

1437
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:48,780
and in in tricome density and so it went

1438
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,420
from being a lesser amount of plants

1439
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,819
needed to rub 10 grams to a much higher

1440
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,500
amount of time

1441
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:58,380
um 10 grams and so

1442
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,119
my personal experiences in India were

1443
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,079
not in Parvati Valley actually the first

1444
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,260
ones

1445
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:06,300
um they were in mostly in kinar in spiti

1446
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,339
um in the more remote regions of

1447
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,559
Himachal Pradesh where there's much less

1448
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:13,858
of a tourist drug trade and much more of

1449
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,740
a local traditional consumption and

1450
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:19,980
there the Charis is referred to as

1451
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:21,959
jungli jungli being the word which gave

1452
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:25,440
us the word in English for Jungle it

1453
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,599
means forest in Hindi and his Forest

1454
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,480
hash in that regards can be thought of

1455
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:32,640
as hash rubbed from feral plants yes now

1456
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,699
the hash rub from feral plants in my

1457
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,338
opinion that is the Pinnacle of the

1458
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:40,799
world of Charis because not only have

1459
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:42,420
the domesticate plants been losing

1460
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,019
um I can't really explain much more

1461
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:48,059
about why but the the the testimony of

1462
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:50,759
the farmers that they're losing

1463
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:53,460
um THC content over time

1464
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,440
um whereas the feral plants are becoming

1465
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,260
irrelevant with very few people outside

1466
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,358
side of like for example in Kulu which

1467
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,280
is at the bottom of the valley

1468
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:04,799
um it's a much bigger city it's outside

1469
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,540
of property you'll find drug addicts

1470
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,760
like you know going and rubbing

1471
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:10,079
handsworth from the feral plants on you

1472
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,260
know Dusty ice plants on the side of the

1473
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,539
road that happens but more and more in

1474
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:18,359
the main sort of producing Villages like

1475
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,739
rasal Malana there are far less feral

1476
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:21,960
plants now than there were before

1477
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:24,179
because the feral plants are often the

1478
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,579
first to be targeted in in eradication

1479
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:28,618
campaigns you know the cops will come

1480
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:30,119
and put a little bit of pressure and the

1481
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,260
cops themselves probably won't be

1482
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,318
clearing the fields but they'll be

1483
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,480
telling the villagers

1484
00:57:33,318 --> 00:57:38,818
and they'll clear the federal plants

1485
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,940
below the village that are in plain view

1486
00:57:38,818 --> 00:57:43,800
of the path yeah what's up which you

1487
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,179
know and that doesn't satisfy the Cubs

1488
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,280
then maybe they'll cut down a few

1489
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:49,078
domestic Fields so I think that really

1490
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,720
the sort of the Pinnacle the Holy Grail

1491
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:54,660
whatever you want to call it is the the

1492
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,299
jungli is the and not all jungle is

1493
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:59,879
equal it needs to be

1494
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:01,680
who can rub very well and can rub a good

1495
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,019
quality cream slowly without much

1496
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,659
contaminant but if he rubs from feral

1497
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:09,719
plants you can expect a bigger diversity

1498
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:12,719
of cannabinoids and terpenes which you

1499
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,699
know when consumed fresh or aged leads

1500
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,279
to much more pronounced and distinct

1501
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:20,699
experience and I think that's where the

1502
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,880
magic of of Parvati and Charis in

1503
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:26,039
general is is is live resin made from

1504
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,619
you know live plants

1505
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:29,818
um funnily enough all the all the Gora

1506
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:31,559
you know all the foreigners they're

1507
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:33,019
pretty excited about consuming it fresh

1508
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,298
because that's when it's really terpy

1509
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:38,579
but also quite caustic on the throat all

1510
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:40,920
local swear by smoking it after a year

1511
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:43,019
when it's lost a lot of its taste but

1512
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,119
it's much smoother and provides a more

1513
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:48,139
competitive narcotic kind of effect

1514
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,298
that's really interesting

1515
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:53,098
uh I think so too man I love going out

1516
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:55,858
there and trying all this stuff you know

1517
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:57,539
the locals are like yo like because it's

1518
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:59,159
they don't have some they produce a lot

1519
00:58:57,539 --> 00:59:00,838
but they don't produce a lot of the best

1520
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:03,719
grades you normally need to commission

1521
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:05,338
that so if you wanted say a few kilos of

1522
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:07,379
super cream or something you'd need to

1523
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:09,239
come in advance and say I want you to

1524
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,579
make and you need to trust and stuff and

1525
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,139
so when you're sort of going there on

1526
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:14,940
the spot and asking them give me your

1527
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:16,858
best stuff they're kind of like don't

1528
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,220
smoke it too quick and I'm like here I'm

1529
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:21,420
on a mission try everything

1530
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:24,719
as fast as possible so you better

1531
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:28,079
believe you know yeah dude

1532
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:30,239
yeah man I you know usually my I have my

1533
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,220
co-host NASA with me and right now I

1534
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:35,039
would be making a joke about sending him

1535
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:36,838
over to suitcase some a lot of cream and

1536
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,298
bring it back you know what I mean the

1537
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:42,058
the old traditional suitcase if you get

1538
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:44,460
my drift yeah

1539
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:46,798
come on yeah human wallet

1540
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:49,858
I remember back in uh I was in Denmark

1541
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,719
for a little brief period of time

1542
00:59:49,858 --> 00:59:53,759
I'm at a Danish chick and they're pretty

1543
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:55,879
famous for bringing bringing the dudes

1544
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,079
back to Denmark and anyway

1545
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,818
they got this little hippie commune

1546
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,720
there that sort of or anarchists call me

1547
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:02,099
in the

1548
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:03,598
um let's change a lot but basically

1549
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,880
there's kind of this Marketplace and

1550
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,859
it's all it's changed a lot a lot a lot

1551
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,880
so but back in the day I remember there

1552
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:13,318
was always

1553
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:17,460
um ass hash or briefcase hash uh well

1554
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:20,519
like eggs or super flat or big bricks of

1555
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:22,679
kashmiri that came God knows

1556
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:24,239
but you know it was always like the the

1557
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:26,639
briefcase hash yeah man that was yeah

1558
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:27,618
yeah how often did you choose the ass

1559
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,058
hash

1560
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:33,000
honestly I don't like it you know like

1561
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,920
you know what like uh there's a study

1562
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,059
with Madrid where they found that like

1563
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:41,039
every sample of uh of hash that they

1564
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:43,740
they found was contaminated with fecal

1565
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:47,099
matter oh wow do you ever heard of that

1566
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:48,419
yeah yeah brutal look I think you know

1567
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:50,579
I'm not that's definitely not something

1568
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,920
I'm looking to consume yeah

1569
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:55,559
but you know in order to maybe sort of

1570
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,940
contextualize this and

1571
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,440
um everything else that might seem a

1572
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,760
little bit odd about hygiene that we're

1573
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,980
talking about

1574
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,680
um I I think I'd like to sort of

1575
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:06,298
um explain a little bit about how

1576
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:09,480
um you know an analogy in winemaking

1577
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:12,119
would maybe be the most uh illustrative

1578
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,699
um and it's that when you have an Old

1579
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:16,559
Winery with you know very porous walls

1580
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:19,259
from an old traditional building you

1581
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,599
know one that wasn't built you know up

1582
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,160
to code or according to what some

1583
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,900
bureaucrats wanted just traditional

1584
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,399
building you know people knocked it up

1585
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:29,280
because they needed it

1586
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,260
um those walls will accumulate yeast and

1587
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,780
all these things over long long periods

1588
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,339
of time but when you're talking about a

1589
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,260
country which has you know heavy

1590
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:38,699
bureaucracy especially when it comes to

1591
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:41,579
things like food products you know the

1592
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:43,379
US does not allow like I mean maybe this

1593
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:45,480
has changed but I remember like it was a

1594
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,519
big deal that if you guys didn't allow

1595
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,780
like raw cow's milk cheese which is like

1596
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:50,780
the best cheese yeah

1597
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:56,699
live you know lactic bacteria culture

1598
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:57,980
leads to much more complexity of taste

1599
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:00,598
and flavor

1600
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,460
but there are a huge big hygiene you

1601
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:04,798
know concerns in the U.S which

1602
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,599
confuses me because I also get told on

1603
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,818
the other side that standards are lacks

1604
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:10,559
compared to the EU and so I think

1605
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:12,179
without being a chauvinist or without

1606
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,680
trying to

1607
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:16,618
um I'd like to I don't know I guess

1608
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:19,798
praise the the the the Europeans for

1609
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:22,318
having that sort of uh ability to be

1610
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:25,019
very hygienic when they think that it

1611
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,759
matters yeah during the harvesting of

1612
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:28,798
the grapes and everything else but

1613
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,960
allowing certain contaminants during

1614
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:33,239
other parts of the process because

1615
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,760
they're either a part of the traditional

1616
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:37,919
method or they have some sort of an

1617
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:41,280
impact on the taste or something sure

1618
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,559
yeah in that regards I I kind of place

1619
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,660
the skin cells in that regards if you're

1620
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,940
a Craft Beer Drinker you'll probably

1621
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:49,199
seen the Brett beer that's came about in

1622
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:52,679
the last sort of

1623
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,179
10 years or so and you know we describe

1624
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:58,019
it as like barnyard

1625
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:59,940
Aromas and smells right and taste we

1626
01:02:58,019 --> 01:03:02,099
find it very typically in well it's

1627
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,659
caused by bacterial infection which you

1628
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:06,359
can get rid of through proper hygiene

1629
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:08,578
yeah I find it a lot in French wines and

1630
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:10,318
you know Americans you know they they're

1631
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:11,940
pasting panels when the supermarkets are

1632
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,818
going to buy like onto the side of

1633
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:17,940
leaders and stuff and they're like no

1634
01:03:13,818 --> 01:03:20,279
hell no and it took you know decades and

1635
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:22,619
for the craft beer and hipsters to come

1636
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,298
out and be like no these bacterias are

1637
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:26,039
actually okay and we're gonna

1638
01:03:24,298 --> 01:03:27,780
incorporate them you know voluntarily

1639
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:29,338
into the beer and then that's still

1640
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,839
changing the mind but there is a big

1641
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:33,599
difference sort of

1642
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:36,298
um there's a big difference in

1643
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,000
um the the way the traditional lot

1644
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:41,219
driven products are conceived of and the

1645
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,900
requirements you know a lot of people

1646
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:43,679
um where I come from might say that if

1647
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,079
you

1648
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:49,199
create a formula and you sanitize

1649
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,660
everything then it can't express the the

1650
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:54,480
soil and the culture and the life you

1651
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:56,039
know yeah so so bear that in mind if you

1652
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,798
feel a little bit disgusted by finger

1653
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:00,420
hash yeah yeah you know it's it's one of

1654
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,338
those things where it's like hey I can't

1655
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,579
see it but in my in the back of my mind

1656
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:08,639
it's always there you know

1657
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:09,780
someone's proteins yeah you know I will

1658
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:11,699
I'll tell you what what you really

1659
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,380
should worry about and this is this is a

1660
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:14,818
significant concern actually is is

1661
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,140
adulterance

1662
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:19,079
um adulterance

1663
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:21,779
um caused by the I mean the size of the

1664
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:24,059
of the fields in place like Parvati or

1665
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:27,900
in uttarakhand they've increased

1666
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:29,339
passively you know 10-fold 100 fold or

1667
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,139
in you know different places over the

1668
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:34,199
course of the last few decades and they

1669
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:37,199
still can't quite meet um demand and so

1670
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:39,659
you know there's always sort of a lack

1671
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:43,259
of product and for example in Parvati

1672
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:45,239
the backstop is made up by Nepalese who

1673
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,940
themselves make up the the laboring

1674
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:51,419
class in Himachal Pradesh and they also

1675
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:53,579
often rub hash on contract for himachali

1676
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,260
landowners and if they can't meet their

1677
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:57,780
quotas they'll incorporate a little bit

1678
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,980
of Nepali hash into into the Milan at

1679
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,319
the bulk it out so they can get a better

1680
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,298
price per gram from their landlord

1681
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,519
um and then down in the in the valley

1682
01:05:03,298 --> 01:05:07,440
it's definitely being contaminated or

1683
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:11,039
adulterated with all sorts of things

1684
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,440
like dupe like incense sticks henna

1685
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,699
um just mud

1686
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,619
random crap

1687
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:18,298
um just in order to to you know bulk it

1688
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:19,798
up and I mean I don't know explain why

1689
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:21,960
they do everybody knows why they do it

1690
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:23,400
yeah but the other thing when you're

1691
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,920
getting only the top quality and you

1692
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,240
know it's not adult rated well then you

1693
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,200
need to make sure you know you're

1694
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:29,939
probably going to want to rub it

1695
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:31,798
yourself if you're worried about hygiene

1696
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:34,079
is that they do stuff like when they're

1697
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:36,298
first starting they'll rub their

1698
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:39,000
eyebrows in order to get some oil on

1699
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:40,798
their fingers and that will provide the

1700
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
the first

1701
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:43,019
um you know because what you're trying

1702
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,059
to do is you're trying to lift the

1703
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:46,619
trichomes off of the off of the plant

1704
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:49,319
yeah so

1705
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:52,260
in they need you need good weather

1706
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:54,599
conditions and you need your hands to be

1707
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,040
the basically the perfect humidity and

1708
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,559
smooth if they're too dry or something

1709
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,900
it's not a real problem if your hands do

1710
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,480
need to be conditioned somehow the

1711
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:05,880
easiest way is to spit on them or to rub

1712
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,980
your hair to rub behind your ears to rub

1713
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,480
your eyebrows and they do that and the

1714
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:12,298
most oil that part of your face yeah

1715
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:14,099
yeah yeah they got the same and so yeah

1716
01:06:12,298 --> 01:06:16,159
honestly I probably shouldn't be saying

1717
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,900
the stuff on

1718
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:21,539
but it's the truth you know it's part of

1719
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:24,960
the culture and how exactly and frankly

1720
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:27,358
when you're combusting it

1721
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,460
yeah you're burning the [ __ ] out of it

1722
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:32,880
right but but I understand the icky part

1723
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:34,440
of it yeah I mean yeah it's it's just

1724
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,140
one of those things as an OCD person

1725
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,460
like that it just yeah but I I can get

1726
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:40,440
over it pretty easily when it comes to

1727
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,420
weed or I mean I just think back to the

1728
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,059
[ __ ] that was in like

1729
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:48,059
hard drugs that I did and it's like it's

1730
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:49,740
finger like worrying about skin compared

1731
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:53,579
to some of the cut that was in hard

1732
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:55,919
drugs like it just it seems uh silly but

1733
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:57,599
yeah there we are

1734
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,920
so a lot of people that are going to be

1735
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:04,760
going to your site after watching the

1736
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:08,220
show which is um zumia cannabisco.com

1737
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:10,619
so we do start by consensus and the

1738
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:12,798
consensus was a an unwieldy and

1739
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:15,900
cumbersome website name and

1740
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:20,059
advantages of being uh you know a

1741
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:22,740
collective led by consensus but yeah

1742
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:23,760
cannabisco.com so one of the first

1743
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:25,379
questions that people are going to be

1744
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,299
asking and I know and you're probably

1745
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,700
going to get 100 emails about this after

1746
01:07:27,298 --> 01:07:31,920
so I figured maybe let's just try to

1747
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:34,439
curb some of the emails what's what's

1748
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,559
one of the lines you would recommend for

1749
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,858
a California indoor garden from your

1750
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:44,180
indoor garden indoor light Garden from

1751
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:47,699
your uh selections and exceptions

1752
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:49,259
so I think that there's like um it's

1753
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,759
kind of like the Chinese restaurants in

1754
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,859
the UK or the US you know people feel

1755
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,440
more comfortable with kind of like an

1756
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:57,719
intermediary or familiarity of some sort

1757
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,420
yeah Fleet in diversion perhaps a little

1758
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:02,338
bit less feisty and so in that regards I

1759
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,619
think some of the land race ibls can be

1760
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:07,078
quite appropriate for Growers who lack

1761
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:09,838
the confidence to approach you know a

1762
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:12,780
long flowering varietal in that regards

1763
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:15,000
the the the classic sort of uh lowland

1764
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:17,579
Thai stick accession from us would be

1765
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,279
the Dai Deng which is the

1766
01:08:17,579 --> 01:08:22,920
transliteration for Red Thread

1767
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:24,960
um that's the the legendary Red Thread

1768
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,719
Thai sticks from from Eastern from back

1769
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,000
in the day we're working with a clan

1770
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:32,159
from Macomb who you know have been

1771
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,520
working with old seed stock reproducing

1772
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:36,420
in a in a pretty large population now

1773
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,640
since quite a few years before

1774
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,980
legalization

1775
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,440
um yeah and so that would be a little

1776
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:45,899
bit you know shorter flowering

1777
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:47,278
um a little bit you know more it's still

1778
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:48,778
going to have a lot of vigor but it's

1779
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,120
going to be a bit more uniform in its

1780
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:52,620
canopy and its growth patterns and so as

1781
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,659
far as the the sort of the very

1782
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:56,579
equatorial lines I think that would be a

1783
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:59,099
really approachable line for beginners

1784
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:01,679
saying that the picture I think that's

1785
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:06,298
on the background here of the of the

1786
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:09,960
post of the issue and that's a scar

1787
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:11,640
Karen genetics from the King kachan

1788
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,338
National Park area on the border with

1789
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,640
Myanmar in Thailand yeah I can see it's

1790
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:20,640
huge plant grows really vigorously you

1791
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,079
know it's resistant to everything you

1792
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,480
don't need to walk too much don't need

1793
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:27,000
to feed it much it just grows like hell

1794
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:29,278
and so if space isn't your concern you

1795
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,198
know then you know you can consider

1796
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:33,600
going for something like that

1797
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:36,659
um but ultimately if you're working with

1798
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,400
really stretchy long flowering varietals

1799
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:40,079
like this there are quite a few tricks

1800
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,420
that you can take

1801
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:44,460
um to both shorten the flowering and to

1802
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,838
manage the canopy more evenly maybe we

1803
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,759
can get a little bit yeah please do

1804
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:48,719
people are going to be wanting those

1805
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,060
jobs

1806
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,439
well so I would say that if you have the

1807
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,000
ability if you're not a commercial

1808
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:56,819
grower even if you are and you have the

1809
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,219
ability to sacrifice a space for a cycle

1810
01:09:56,819 --> 01:10:00,899
in order to do final hunts I think

1811
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:03,539
that's the way to do it

1812
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:05,219
um the idea of you know stabilizing

1813
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:07,140
Pinos and also you're going to be

1814
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:09,119
dealing with the intersex traits that

1815
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:12,060
are common in the Landry's Gene pools of

1816
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,019
Asia yeah and so you know breeding with

1817
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,780
those can be a bit of a challenge

1818
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:18,360
however doing Mass selections you know

1819
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:21,119
hunts based on big amounts then putting

1820
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:24,420
your your cuttings from select mothers

1821
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:27,119
directly into flower in small pots with

1822
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:29,640
a high planting density you can turn

1823
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,439
pretty pretty fast cycles and you can

1824
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,060
get really good yields and so I would

1825
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:36,419
say if you have the ability to do so

1826
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:38,100
please attempt to follow this uh this

1827
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:42,000
path as it's probably the most

1828
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,980
commercially viable otherwise

1829
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,800
um the Indian Land races from the

1830
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:49,439
Himalayas they're going to be somewhat

1831
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:52,860
shorter than the ties

1832
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:56,698
um the difference would be 24 to 20

1833
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:58,859
weeks or 20 to six weeks not huge but

1834
01:10:56,698 --> 01:11:00,719
still if you're if you're somebody who

1835
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:03,658
struggles to maintain the plant's health

1836
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:05,520
during long flowering periods then maybe

1837
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:07,619
you're looking you know to shorten that

1838
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,480
down a little bit you'll find that in

1839
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:11,760
the in the cultivars from higher

1840
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:14,759
altitude and from more northernly

1841
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:17,159
locations in general your your Thai

1842
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,719
varietals your cambodians your laotians

1843
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:21,359
are going to be

1844
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:24,840
depending on you know you and your

1845
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:27,359
growth we've seen seven meter plants in

1846
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,819
the village in sagang and Myanmar so

1847
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,380
that's that's your upper limit

1848
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:35,099
um

1849
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:37,500
so generally speaking LST a lot of

1850
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:39,000
pruning a lot of cutting back topping

1851
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,679
Etc I think the techniques that can

1852
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,140
benefit you

1853
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:45,658
um if you have the ability to let the

1854
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:47,940
plants grow without any sort of topping

1855
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:50,158
they do respond better to this yeah

1856
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:52,919
these plants are not used to being

1857
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:55,079
individually cuddled their land race

1858
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,719
plants coming from huge Fields the

1859
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:59,219
farmers do not pay attention to single

1860
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,380
plants yeah

1861
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:03,420
fields are too far away too high up too

1862
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,739
remote Etc and so

1863
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:07,260
um you know they a lot of them will

1864
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:09,299
never ever have been talked before you

1865
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,159
know and we've seen that given the

1866
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,679
intersex traits being a little bit of an

1867
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:15,899
issue for some people

1868
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:18,480
if you have the ability to to not stress

1869
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:19,738
them out then you know don't stress them

1870
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,019
out

1871
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:24,238
um but at the same time you know we

1872
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:26,159
we're saying that in order to earn on

1873
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:29,039
the side of caution yeah my personal

1874
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:31,619
experience has been incredibly resistant

1875
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,000
hearty vigorous tolerant plants that

1876
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:35,279
basically take whatever you throw at

1877
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,960
them and I find it funny to contrast

1878
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,000
that with the image that a lot of people

1879
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,460
have as these really sort of finicky and

1880
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,439
difficult to grow plants like no not at

1881
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,658
all the opposite they're difficult to

1882
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,000
make them stop growing like you're

1883
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,500
you're trying to you're trying to manage

1884
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,179
them and that's that's that's a whole

1885
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,219
different new different set of problems

1886
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:55,679
basically I think a lot of that is for

1887
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:58,140
people trying to bring in stuff that's

1888
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,000
been acclimated to Thailand Outdoors to

1889
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:02,520
indoors and they just don't get it like

1890
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,738
they're trying to feed it you know GH

1891
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,300
nutrients like just

1892
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:07,439
stuffing it full of nutrients and stuff

1893
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,600
and that's not what a lot of these land

1894
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:10,979
races want they don't they don't respond

1895
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,260
well to that of course it'll make them

1896
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:14,519
finicky yeah yeah you know I think one

1897
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,460
place where the Cannabis industry is

1898
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,620
really far behind in regards to

1899
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,380
um in regards to the wine industry or

1900
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:26,099
other teeth is in terms of understanding

1901
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:29,760
soil compositions and minerals Etc

1902
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:32,520
um the you know clearly fertile loamy

1903
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,980
soils lots of water that is strong

1904
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,900
vegetative growth that is not what we're

1905
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:38,279
seeking to necessarily do especially

1906
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:39,899
with plants that have such a long

1907
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:41,939
flowering period and we're trying to

1908
01:13:39,899 --> 01:13:44,279
reduce the overall cycle

1909
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:46,738
um in the wine industry for example we

1910
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:49,319
apply such techniques as partial root

1911
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:51,238
dehydration which would be which will

1912
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:53,840
serve to stress the plant in very

1913
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:56,339
tactical ways in order to induce

1914
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,199
specific physiological changes that we

1915
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,199
want to see in the plant's phytochemical

1916
01:13:58,198 --> 01:14:03,299
makeup right yeah chemical makeup

1917
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,979
um and so as far as that goes with these

1918
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,199
land races you'll find that they're not

1919
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:09,959
growing in sort of like these beautiful

1920
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,759
pristine soils like you know like we're

1921
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,960
talking about like if we're in Cambodia

1922
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,600
a lot of the time this is going to be

1923
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,219
maybe a bit sad to hear these days

1924
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,400
um The Growers are no longer next to the

1925
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:23,340
Mekong floodplain areas they're they're

1926
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:26,639
in freshly deforested rainforest which

1927
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:28,319
is often been deforested for Timber or

1928
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,320
sometimes specifically for growing

1929
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:34,340
cannabis and so in that regards the

1930
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:37,559
jungle soils are often very very poor

1931
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:41,480
in Parvati Valley we see totally

1932
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:45,420
degraded soils from overuse of urea

1933
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:47,158
and very very very acidic soils on the

1934
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:49,260
bottom of slopes where everything's sort

1935
01:14:47,158 --> 01:14:52,139
of draining down and accumulating and

1936
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:55,199
the plants are still thriving

1937
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:56,699
um relatively um yeah we've got

1938
01:14:55,198 --> 01:15:00,178
different criteria here too when you're

1939
01:14:56,698 --> 01:15:01,678
growing 25 acres on a hillside it

1940
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,719
doesn't really matter if you have one or

1941
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,560
two plants that are a little bit raggedy

1942
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:05,819
looking

1943
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,440
um

1944
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:09,658
no one's ever going to see the flower

1945
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:11,039
it's going to get robbed anyway so yeah

1946
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:13,799
it's a little bit of a different

1947
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:15,300
concerns in that regard

1948
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,820
that makes sense

1949
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,400
um yeah the way we treat plants in the

1950
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:22,859
U.S compared to these big massive Fields

1951
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:24,599
is night and day different uh we're just

1952
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:26,539
modeling them it's cute you know yeah

1953
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,699
all right

1954
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:31,019
taking care of your babies and for

1955
01:15:29,698 --> 01:15:32,698
people that are worried about intersex

1956
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:34,260
traits and stuff just remember like

1957
01:15:32,698 --> 01:15:35,579
anything if you're watching this

1958
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,219
anything

1959
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:40,079
intersex like any other trait in

1960
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:44,039
cannabis whether it's purple whether

1961
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,719
it's a scent it can be bred out or bred

1962
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,279
in you know I mean this is something

1963
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:49,198
that can be selected for or selected

1964
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,539
again so you're a little scared of

1965
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:55,579
things like that it's it's very easy to

1966
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:55,579
work out yeah well yes yeah

1967
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:02,219
[Music]

1968
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:05,219
I drew are patterns of cultivation

1969
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:07,920
um including periods of time where many

1970
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:10,198
males are being called before reverting

1971
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,119
to Total open pollination for a few

1972
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,738
decades for example

1973
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:15,059
um that'll be enough to bring out

1974
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:16,259
interest X traits in your population

1975
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,420
sure

1976
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:20,039
um and if you're talking about you know

1977
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,140
hypothetical land race which has been

1978
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,600
growing on a hillside or maybe that's a

1979
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:26,460
bad example on a flood plain for a long

1980
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,380
time there will be maybe a little

1981
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:30,779
portion of the field that's

1982
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:34,140
raised above the water the water level

1983
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:35,579
and so you know every again this is

1984
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:38,219
totally hypothetical scenario I'm just

1985
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:40,019
making up sure here every you know maybe

1986
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:44,158
60 years you've got some catastrophic

1987
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:46,800
plots and once every cycle of floods

1988
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:49,319
they happen to kill all the males yeah

1989
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,600
literally every single one if the plant

1990
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:54,179
or the population did not have the

1991
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,640
intersex trades within it then that

1992
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:58,800
population would just disappear

1993
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:01,140
um with the flood correct and so it's a

1994
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,600
survival mechanism that's found in large

1995
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,880
cannabis populations and so it just goes

1996
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,219
hand in hand with land races but

1997
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,199
especially with land races that have

1998
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:11,819
gone through periods of intense

1999
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:14,579
cultivation

2000
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:17,519
um or which are being grown according to

2001
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:20,340
the the modern sort of reading practices

2002
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,800
of separating males and

2003
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,119
it makes sense that's some good context

2004
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,400
to add to it

2005
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:28,319
so is there any other strains you want

2006
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,179
to talk about or get into

2007
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,439
um before we wrap it up like because I

2008
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,239
want I want to be able to point people

2009
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:34,439
to some specific stuff they could check

2010
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:37,079
out on your site is there something

2011
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:38,399
other than what we've mentioned sure

2012
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:40,198
well we talked about the sort of the

2013
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:41,698
easier to approach ones

2014
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:43,439
um which again I don't think that

2015
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:45,059
there's you know maybe necessarily a

2016
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,399
huge difference in the in the skill

2017
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,900
curve acquired sure but I will say that

2018
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:53,039
kronkravio

2019
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:55,019
um cronkravia is the reputed to be you

2020
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:57,779
know the most potent the strongest of

2021
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,760
all the the land race has grown in in

2022
01:17:57,779 --> 01:18:02,219
territory of Thailand

2023
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,320
um and it's it's a wonderful it's a

2024
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:06,840
wonderful kind of a succession

2025
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:09,000
um we we see phenotypes that are really

2026
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:12,480
really resonance with a sort of

2027
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:15,060
fermented sticky Sweet Lemon character

2028
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:18,359
which I very personally fond of it

2029
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:20,280
reminds me of my experiences with

2030
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:23,519
um cannabis from Amsterdam in the late

2031
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:26,279
90s with amnesia hazes which have this

2032
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,860
sort of it incense incensey kind of

2033
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:31,559
lemon character the best friend kravia

2034
01:18:28,859 --> 01:18:35,158
expresses itself along those lines and

2035
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:38,400
it's very very potent it grows with a

2036
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:41,519
pretty unique uh bud structure which I

2037
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:44,099
think will take a lot of You by surprise

2038
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,360
um it's it might if you look at it if

2039
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,159
you look at it from far away it looks

2040
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:49,079
like a totally normal Canada flag you

2041
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:51,059
look at it close up looks a little bit

2042
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:53,519
more like a mutant the the butt

2043
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:56,219
structure very loose and open and that

2044
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,040
allows for the UVS to penetrate you know

2045
01:18:56,219 --> 01:19:00,658
deep inside and so it

2046
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:03,420
it's

2047
01:19:00,658 --> 01:19:06,539
it's rare to find sedative narcotic

2048
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:08,119
cannabis due in in Southeast Asia due to

2049
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:10,319
the long growing period

2050
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:12,359
where the trichomes are taking a long

2051
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:15,179
time to ripen but we found it on the

2052
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:17,039
cronkravia there's there's you know such

2053
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:18,480
penetration all the way in that we're

2054
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:21,600
seeing quite a high amount of photo

2055
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:23,759
oxidation and so if you cut it at the

2056
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,100
right time it's got this clear bright

2057
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,960
racy cerebral high but if you let it go

2058
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,940
all the way which can be as long as 28

2059
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,859
weeks you'll definitely see a lot of

2060
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:33,779
really dark colored trichomes in a much

2061
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:35,399
more narcotic sedative effect and

2062
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:37,619
personally I've really enjoyed both

2063
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:40,619
expressions of the of the krunkravia in

2064
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:42,960
that regards otherwise the Thai mango is

2065
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:44,880
like you know everybody loves mango it's

2066
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,980
such a Delicious Fruit

2067
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,980
um and you know the mango expressions in

2068
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:52,979
in Asia whether that's you know mysuru

2069
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:55,678
or high or Cambodian mango or whatever

2070
01:19:52,979 --> 01:20:00,479
else they range from the sort of the

2071
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:03,899
green mentholated camphor mango blue to

2072
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:06,419
the or ripe red juicy mangoes and people

2073
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:08,579
price different things generally if it's

2074
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:11,158
called mamuwan which is mango and Thai

2075
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:13,140
it's going more for the ripe mango

2076
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:14,519
Spectrum as the green light blue is

2077
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:17,520
something that's more commonly found

2078
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,800
across the board in Southeast Asia in

2079
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,140
we've seen a lot basically

2080
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:25,800
it's a red mango that sort of really

2081
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:28,140
valued and prized as far as that goes

2082
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,659
um lowland areas where mango

2083
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:33,060
traditionally was grown and selected are

2084
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:34,500
pretty much overrun and so we our

2085
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:37,020
accessions in the north of the country

2086
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:39,300
around Chiang Mai with some smaller

2087
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:42,659
Growers doing open pollinations in in

2088
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:45,300
the sticks um like 80 to 100 150

2089
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:46,920
kilometers outside the city and one of

2090
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:50,039
them one of the groups is a Hmong group

2091
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:53,819
in DOI in tanon the tallest Mount Chiang

2092
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:55,979
Mai and not only is it one of the most

2093
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:57,658
stunningly beautiful places that if you

2094
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:59,579
just if you could picture yourself

2095
01:20:57,658 --> 01:21:01,819
smoking weed from that place in that

2096
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:05,359
place it's really just have an honor

2097
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:07,380
but the Thai mango from this

2098
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:09,539
due to the altitude in the cold

2099
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:11,640
temperatures which is not that cold in

2100
01:21:09,539 --> 01:21:13,738
Thailand but in 2000 meters two thousand

2101
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:17,219
feet gets a bit nippy comes across

2102
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:19,919
really purple and so we we used to back

2103
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:23,340
in the day sell that as the the Thai

2104
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,679
purple mango and selling out like that

2105
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:27,060
every single time so we actually just

2106
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,859
took the purple about the name because

2107
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:32,280
we wanted people to try other stuff you

2108
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:34,559
know yeah but yeah you you probably

2109
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:35,698
should check out the time angle if uh if

2110
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,219
that's your thing if you like purple

2111
01:21:35,698 --> 01:21:41,039
colors otherwise we made some selections

2112
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:44,279
from Individual black plants in Parvati

2113
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:47,100
Valley namely in nirang

2114
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:49,679
um also in Tosh I think Tash is really

2115
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:52,560
the two to look out for the shoran and

2116
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:56,219
[ __ ] Fields they're really high altitude

2117
01:21:52,560 --> 01:22:00,719
Fields above the Tosh kutla and you know

2118
01:21:56,219 --> 01:22:03,960
there we we saw maybe like one plant in

2119
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:07,260
10 showing any coloration one plant 100

2120
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,719
showing significant and then one in a

2121
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:12,000
thousand being like pure black or dark

2122
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:14,760
maroon red kind of purple and so those

2123
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,500
plants we made selections from and we

2124
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,060
separated those out so if you're looking

2125
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,560
to Fino hunt

2126
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,360
um you know those are going to provide

2127
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,300
you you know a slightly better chance

2128
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:25,920
than the general population

2129
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,100
um which is which which one specifically

2130
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,100
is that

2131
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:30,839
um well maybe I'll just explain to you

2132
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,640
how we split up so we got the general

2133
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,440
populations which are from you know

2134
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,900
we've asked the farmers to basically

2135
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:39,059
basically mix all this that's actually

2136
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:40,198
what they do by standard they rub plants

2137
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,760
from all the fields and they sit in

2138
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:43,259
their house and a little pile of seed

2139
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,420
accumulates below them and we ask them

2140
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:48,780
just to sort through it to clean it out

2141
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:50,880
Etc sure the selections is either us or

2142
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:52,920
like members of our team or the Farmers

2143
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,900
making selections so it's like a village

2144
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,819
selection then that that's just when

2145
01:22:54,899 --> 01:22:57,839
we've gone there for two three days for

2146
01:22:56,819 --> 01:22:59,579
example

2147
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,319
um we're going and looking for all the

2148
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:03,420
best plants that we can

2149
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:05,219
um and putting the side the seeds aside

2150
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,440
for those apart from the general

2151
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:09,239
population and then there's the single

2152
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:12,000
plant selections which you'll see or

2153
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:13,439
sorry the the Leo D we need to figure

2154
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,880
out an English word for this I don't

2155
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,579
know what it should be man but in French

2156
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:21,300
it's Beauty it's like the climate it's

2157
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:22,920
like the plot the plot is such a clumsy

2158
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,039
word it's not very romantic you know

2159
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,060
yeah right so I don't know we need to

2160
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:29,939
come up with the word for that but yeah

2161
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:32,699
so the the plot selections are obviously

2162
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:33,960
selections made from Individual plots

2163
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:35,819
um you know as I said before we're

2164
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,460
encouraging the farmers to rub from

2165
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:39,840
Individual fields and to tell their

2166
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,399
customers the name of the fields that

2167
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,619
they're rubbing from as a way to

2168
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:45,479
increase the value of the product

2169
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:47,099
um and so we're making selections from

2170
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:50,879
those two and then the individual plants

2171
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:52,560
and so for example it'll be like um the

2172
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,560
Tosh goodla which is the name of the

2173
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,980
village and then shorang the name of the

2174
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:01,739
of the of the garden and then the black

2175
01:23:58,979 --> 01:24:03,718
selection and so you know that's your

2176
01:24:01,738 --> 01:24:06,079
your single plant selection from from

2177
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:06,079
the guy

2178
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,659
that's awesome to make all of them

2179
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:11,539
available so people actually have a

2180
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:14,059
choice you know

2181
01:24:11,539 --> 01:24:16,619
well well well well well well

2182
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:18,900
subscribers and patreons get first dibs

2183
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:20,219
so let's talk about this real quick um

2184
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:22,979
because I didn't even know this was a

2185
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:24,899
thing and I'm gonna join myself I went

2186
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:26,819
and bought seeds from you before we ever

2187
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:28,439
spoke because I was so stoked about this

2188
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:30,000
and like the purchases from the site go

2189
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:35,339
to the farmers which is super important

2190
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:36,960
to me and and Noble as can be and and I

2191
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:39,480
commend you for it

2192
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,100
um but the patreon thing I want to join

2193
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:44,039
so let's talk about some of that

2194
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,480
so yeah well basically the we talked a

2195
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:47,698
lot about incentivizing the communities

2196
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:49,979
the way to do that is to you know as we

2197
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:51,899
said to sell their seats and to get them

2198
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:53,519
paid for it and so yeah

2199
01:24:51,899 --> 01:24:56,039
um you know given that a lot of what we

2200
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,960
do is touching on social issues ones

2201
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:59,939
that you know deal a lot heavily with

2202
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,920
with class with race with with

2203
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:03,719
colonialism Etc

2204
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,640
um and given that there was a need for

2205
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:07,619
for me as a foreigner and for a couple

2206
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,560
of other foreigners to do administrative

2207
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:12,899
slash communication roles

2208
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,699
um we felt that it wasn't right to you

2209
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:17,579
know take us take a cut out of the seed

2210
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:19,379
sales and so instead what we set up was

2211
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:21,658
um a patreon program and a subscription

2212
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:24,239
program on the website and you know

2213
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:26,639
during the course of our work

2214
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:28,859
um we you know myself personally when

2215
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,179
I'm traveling all you know for example

2216
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:33,238
if I'm accessing the general population

2217
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:35,039
I'm going to go go see some go see the

2218
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:36,779
village and go pick up a restock on on

2219
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:38,340
the general Pub a few others there's

2220
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:40,679
going to be like maybe along the way

2221
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:43,679
some Uncle who's like yo

2222
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,539
here and there and that stuff that we

2223
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,859
can't it's not we because we're not in

2224
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:49,019
the business of doing reproductions

2225
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:50,219
right like yeah yeah we don't get seeds

2226
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:52,380
from the hill tribes or whatever and

2227
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:55,198
then grow them out in Bangkok no no it's

2228
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:58,139
directly so we almost you know I mean I

2229
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:59,579
have my own grow but I have so many

2230
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:01,380
things because we're like okay so we're

2231
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:03,658
gonna get these these small quantities

2232
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:04,980
the rarest stuff and that's gonna be for

2233
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,479
for the Nerds you know for the people

2234
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:09,539
who are really passionate and who want

2235
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,759
basically you know hand selected

2236
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:14,639
um seeds from from people who are

2237
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,960
currently and actively sourcing in the

2238
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:18,060
traditional growing regions you know

2239
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:21,119
hand selected point of origin seeds and

2240
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:23,699
so yeah that allows us to to draw an

2241
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:26,819
income which allows us to do the

2242
01:26:23,698 --> 01:26:28,799
recruiting work to bring new you know

2243
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:30,238
groups or communities into the

2244
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,100
collective

2245
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,539
um and so it's it's working with a lot

2246
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,679
of synergy

2247
01:26:33,539 --> 01:26:37,439
um

2248
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:39,119
yeah maybe we're not the best at keeping

2249
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,039
all the social media up to date which is

2250
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:42,960
probably why a lot of you guys might not

2251
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:45,479
have heard of us until now

2252
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,819
um but we definitely you know we we hold

2253
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:49,439
it down with the seeds and you know I

2254
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:51,059
feel like everybody involved is

2255
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,319
satisfied with the amount of genetics

2256
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:54,719
that we're that they're getting from us

2257
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:57,059
we're we're doing our best to stand by

2258
01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:00,600
our people you know ultimately doing

2259
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,820
solid by the traditional indigenous land

2260
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,079
race Community growing communities in

2261
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:06,479
some ways

2262
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:07,738
um takes bread out of people's mouth in

2263
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,079
the west

2264
01:27:07,738 --> 01:27:13,979
um and so we you know we want to be sort

2265
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:16,139
of as as as honest and as helpful

2266
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:19,259
um with people in the west you know to

2267
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:21,119
give them you know as much of a room at

2268
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:22,980
the table as as we can you know because

2269
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:26,099
at the end of the day

2270
01:27:22,979 --> 01:27:28,619
we see this as as a

2271
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:31,380
a way to form new connections and new

2272
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:32,760
Bridges between the communities in

2273
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,380
different countries you know we're so

2274
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,000
disconnected right now

2275
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:38,579
um and with integration I think we would

2276
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,260
all benefit right yeah I I would think

2277
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:42,420
so I mean that's what this is all about

2278
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:45,600
in the end for for us and it's why we

2279
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:47,279
started The Syndicate and yeah I mean

2280
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,380
it's you guys are doing your thing on

2281
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:53,219
the other side and hopefully you know we

2282
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:54,840
were talking even uh more recently about

2283
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:56,698
um The Strain database we're building

2284
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,260
and stuff so hopefully even we can

2285
01:27:56,698 --> 01:27:59,939
continue to collaborate on stuff like

2286
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:03,060
that like I've asked you to help with

2287
01:27:59,939 --> 01:28:04,799
the uh land race portion of our strain

2288
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:06,659
database that we're building that I'm

2289
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:09,480
really super stoked about to have

2290
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:11,759
something accurate and uh yeah there's

2291
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:14,399
all kinds of fun collaborations that we

2292
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,840
can do and reach out and some of it to

2293
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:18,000
some people seems like pie in the sky

2294
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:22,260
stuff but I think we can accomplish a

2295
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,880
lot I agree it's time for for a little

2296
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,199
bit of time to come out of the Shadows a

2297
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,300
little bit

2298
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:29,460
um you know particular countries like

2299
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:32,100
Indonesia with a rich tradition of

2300
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,439
cannabis are very very very oppressive

2301
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,940
and so it's not for lack of want you

2302
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:37,919
know we you know people have always

2303
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:40,439
wanted to reform these legs and

2304
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:43,859
collaborate but now the time feels right

2305
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:47,339
and you know and so if if we can you

2306
01:28:43,859 --> 01:28:49,319
know help some someone make a name for

2307
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:50,699
themselves by breeding the next kind of

2308
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:52,920
this Cup winner

2309
01:28:50,698 --> 01:28:54,839
um from Fino hunting some land race gene

2310
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,100
pool they access through us you know

2311
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,380

person's agreement that you click the
