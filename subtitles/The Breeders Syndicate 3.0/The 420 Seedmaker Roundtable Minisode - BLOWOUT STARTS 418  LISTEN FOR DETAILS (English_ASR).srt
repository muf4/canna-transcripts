00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,319
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,839
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,059
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,859
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,019
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,519
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,379
subculture

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,939
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,099
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,198
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,660
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,079
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,399
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,159
just weren't there

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,299
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,299
to the underground

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,759
all right one of the first things I

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,480
think since since we have you here

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,099
Shawnee like you know one of the things

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,259
that we're often talking about like

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,700
we're in Discord and stuff is hype

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,479
strains

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,879
um

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,979
people admiration different things

26
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,259
people experience as like as they're

27
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,358
just getting back in Divine seeds and

28
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,118
and getting into the scene or in your

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,799
case getting back into it from um you

30
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,219
know being into it real heavy at one

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,900
point and one of the biggest things that

32
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,938
people come to you with is why you hate

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,580
root beer so much what's your problem

34
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:20,279
with Gene what what is this root beer

35
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,780
hate you have and you know I I've always

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,519
seen it from your angle but I would like

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,019
you to explain it from your angle for

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,000
everyone to hear because because when I

39
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,200
hear it I don't hear what they're

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,900
hearing

41
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,719
yeah well I I don't hear what they're he

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,159
I I can kind of uh imagine what they're

43
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,560
hearing but I don't know what they're

44
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,900
hearing either but it's something kind

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,700
of went like viral in our server and it

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,859
just kind of blew up and

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,040
I think because there was a lot of uh

48
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:49,280
arguments around it as well yeah but

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,280
like

50
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:55,560
so yeah so like

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,898
I entered the I the the computer world

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,460
with IG and all this stuff and like you

53
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,140
don't know when you don't know people

54
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,059
you don't know all these like Brands and

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,799
you don't know all this stuff you really

56
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,039
don't have any idea what you're looking

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,080
at but like I I started to like well

58
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,839
hanging out with you guys it's like

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,700
question when I'm buying trying to

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,280
understand on a deeper level all this

61
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,199
sort of stuff so like when there's

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,180
certain things that are like super super

63
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,159
big and I'm like why are they big why

64
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,560
why is this like why does everybody want

65
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,719
this but when I ask those questions to

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
other people it's like I don't get an

67
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,699
answer either yeah

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,080
um and root beer was like the one I

69
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,719
don't know why that was the one that

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,280
stuck but like everybody wanted root

71
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,800
beer but I don't I didn't really

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,360
understand why and I don't think anybody

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,459
else really did either

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,459
I mean I think it was because like it

75
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,439
was just how you asked but why root beer

76
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,000
and I think someone took that as an

77
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,919
offense like it was so offensive that

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,360
you would even ask well but why what do

79
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,039
you mean why there's 30 of us talking

80
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,800
about how much we want it what do you

81
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,419
mean why yeah and Gene's cool and all

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,099
this stuff and like everything verified

83
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,139
and it's like you know what's the

84
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,780
problem but I mean

85
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,059
it's nobody really experienced it like

86
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,180
very few people ever experienced it and

87
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,598
nobody really has any idea it isn't

88
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,980
really proven on any level that we know

89
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,079
but it just kind of like blew up because

90
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,259
of the memes right and all the joking

91
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,260
and and I like there was that podcast

92
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,658
episode where Gene was talking about it

93
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,519
and he seemed really open about it and

94
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:31,739
he that he didn't want to release it

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
because he didn't think it would live up

96
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,939
to the expectation that it had already

97
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,039
built up sure and that you know he

98
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,158
mentioned like her M issues if people

99
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:44,098
were running it indoor and all kinds of

100
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,620
stuff and people still wanted it like

101
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:49,259
crazy you know it's like I don't think

102
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,360
people even listen to him in that

103
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,798
section because what I heard was you

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,319
know maybe it's not as good as everyone

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,700
thinks right yeah sure I think he was

106
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,219
just being realistic yeah giving people

107
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,079
realistic expectations and um and that's

108
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,219
fair I mean like I like I've tried to

109
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,659
tell people when they were arguing with

110
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,519
you and I don't think it is even

111
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:07,439
necessarily about root beer and it

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,060
certainly isn't about just Jean you know

113
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,239
like don't even have a problem with Jean

114
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,719
it means a nice dude but it's more about

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,540
the idea of why why is there height

116
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,858
behind this and and why are we feeling

117
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,600
that it's like sheep what's it what's

118
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,519
what's the cult the phenomenon of it

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,800
right yeah it's a phenomenon

120
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,039
because it just like it's this hive mind

121
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,439
mentality where you know certain things

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
get mentioned enough that everyone's

123
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,139
like damn I want to try that you know

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,780
but like what I want more people to be

125
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,600
doing is is to like understand what they

126
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,478
like what they what they want and if

127
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,040
it's something that they want you know

128
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,099
um

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,460
like I I haven't run any of Gene's stuff

130
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,240
but mainly because he from my

131
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,819
understanding he breeds outdoors in a

132
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,800
region that is far from me and I grow

133
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,800
indoors and it doesn't it doesn't make

134
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,000
sense for me to run his seed sure I like

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,340
I don't know I kind of like there's

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,259
other things I would rather do not not

137
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,659
because of anything against him or

138
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,419
anything like that but like

139
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,820
I've sort of ruled certain certain

140
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:19,560
things out due to things like I just

141
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,899
mentioned right like it's outdoor seed

142
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,660
yeah I mean I think that's something I

143
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,579
wish I not even just you or has and

144
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,759
again not even in relation to Gene

145
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,038
anyone should be taking that into into

146
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,500
what they're doing like okay I'm growing

147
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,959
indoor I need to have seeds and bread

148
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,399
indoor are these breeders breeding my

149
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,418
seeds indoor because if they're bringing

150
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,159
them outdoor and you're trying to bring

151
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,500
them indoor a lot of stuff that does

152
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,539
really well outdoor will have intersex

153
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,279
traits indoor it's common it's very

154
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:48,719
common so that's something people should

155
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,239
be asking but I don't even think anybody

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
even asks that like I don't you think

157
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,879
that was that's not even a part of the

158
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,719
equation when people think about buying

159
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,519
seeds like oh it's a breeders

160
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,820
it often isn't and like that like from

161
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,258
my experience like the average person

162
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,240
they're really looking at all the wrong

163
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,340
things usually you know they're looking

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,379
at like a name that sticks out that

165
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,319
either they have attachment to or what

166
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,360
whatever the reason or a certain like

167
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,879
term profile that it's supposed to be

168
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,160
promising you

169
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,500
or you know like very surface level

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,220
things yeah

171
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,139
um

172
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,240
and I find it interesting actually too

173
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,060
like in our server watching a lot of

174
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,860
people pop some things

175
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,720
that you know are probably going to be

176
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,538
like a high potency and then they're

177
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,160
like whoa this is a little much you know

178
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:40,318
like

179
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,759
maybe they got hit with that for the

180
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,979
first time and they're just like yeah

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
it's it's definitely potent but it might

182
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:49,019
not be what I want to smoke every day

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,180
you know exactly yeah so like I think

184
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,399
that's really great growth for for

185
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,620
people and not like I love that's what I

186
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,138
love about popping seed and trying new

187
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,180
things is like you know it's all about

188
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,918
what you like and experiencing that and

189
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,280
then trying to search for the things

190
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,620
that you know do it for you yeah

191
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,559
that's perfect welcome pack

192
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,959
okay guys laptop pack and we also have

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,300
local botanist here with this so we kind

194
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,459
of just Joy jumped into the conversation

195
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,280
um it's we're recording it a little late

196
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,258
on Friday and uh we're just gonna have a

197
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,698
small round table talk about some

198
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,439
different things

199
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,240
um and of course we're going to talk a

200
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,098
little bit and and that kind of leads

201
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,598
into a little bit of what I was going to

202
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:35,579
get into about like putting people on

203
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:38,339
pedestals like yeah I think that is a

204
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,439
another factor I mean we see it and it

205
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,179
happens here you know like just being

206
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,360
totally transparent I see it happen here

207
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,340
with me with natto we try to keep it as

208
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,699
as real as possible and remind people

209
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:52,978
we're just [ __ ] like low rent Farmers

210
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,780
like I I grow a few types of plants but

211
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,939
I'm I'm not even

212
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,978
capable of being called a real farmer

213
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,240
let alone needing a pedestal you know

214
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,098
and other people don't necessarily

215
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,780
deserve that either but

216
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:05,879
um in the world of marketing and hype

217
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,679
you know dudes flashing Rolexes or fake

218
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,019
Rolexes that doesn't matter if it flips

219
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,879
by real fast you know uh pedestals

220
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,818
happen a lot and

221
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,560
and one thing I've noticed is what

222
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,960
happens when people have their their

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,459
Paradigm shifted on a breeder like let's

224
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,899
say that this is their hero breeder and

225
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,478
they find out something very devastating

226
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,978
it almost it almost breaks people

227
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,659
sometimes

228
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:30,538
as you guys have seen it like people

229
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,199
flip the [ __ ] out sometimes yeah they do

230
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:33,198
yeah

231
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,599
um it's kind of

232
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,019
it's really weird with like grown adult

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,640
men you know yeah it is that they're so

234
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,338
passionate

235
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,319
to that level it's like I'm not a sports

236
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,320
fan but I also get that Vibe when people

237
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,879
are like super into like sports dudes

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,360
yeah yeah you know it's like you're a

239
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,220
grown-up you know yeah it's a dream man

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,740
yeah

241
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,139
it's a trip uh uh the the

242
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,899
um attachment people get to other grown

243
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,278
men like that yeah and admiration that

244
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,019
they hold and I get I get it like

245
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,659
because I had that like it's it's not

246
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,580
like something I don't understand when I

247
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,519
got into the scene like I I remember

248
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,899
looking up to um Adam Dunn like he was

249
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,620
one of the Americans that went over

250
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,299
there to Amsterdam you know and like

251
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,919
I've done Aaron we're over there too but

252
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,599
they were kind of like Hollywood knobs

253
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,360
so I didn't have I didn't like have any

254
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,220
kind of anything Vibe with them you know

255
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,379
but Adam seemed to be smart like he

256
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,080
would talk about his strains and sort of

257
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:39,000
seeing these these uh old California and

258
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,399
and American Colonial strain so I was

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,778
real into him and then over time when

260
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,399
you get to meet people and have

261
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,838
relationships with them and they become

262
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,700
much more human

263
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,019
you realize how much you did have them

264
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,879
on a pedestal at a time when people

265
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,679
because and very often you're

266
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,139
disappointed and sometimes you're not

267
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,819
sometimes people are as special as you

268
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,679
kind of always hoped they would be but

269
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,200
that's that's a rare occurrence local

270
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,519
when you first got into seeds what were

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,899
some of the dudes that you were hearing

272
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,480
about that

273
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,278
um maybe maybe it got you excited at

274
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,560
first and later you you found like maybe

275
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,559
maybe I'm not so into it

276
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,458
yeah um so seats were really weird for

277
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,518
me

278
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:20,039
um you know like I bought like from

279
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,139
Nirvana here and there like

280
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,958
um Dutch Passion was another one but

281
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:29,159
like this was already like you know like

282
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:31,259
I don't know 2015 2016 so it's like

283
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,860
by then it's like nobody was really

284
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:37,139
looking into that yeah um and then I had

285
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,940
a friend who was generous enough just to

286
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,740
give me like a bunch of different seeds

287
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,459
you know

288
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,399
um

289
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:46,619
I think one of them was like uh

290
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,679
something called Blackberry cheesecake

291
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,720
uh like a heavy duty fruity cross you

292
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,879
know things like that

293
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,620
um I grew them and you know for the time

294
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,778
for me I thought they were good because

295
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,299
like they smelled different like it

296
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:02,220
wasn't just like a cheap ass bag on the

297
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,399
street you know yeah

298
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,920
um and then you know after that I I kind

299
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,278
of just started like thinking about

300
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,620
um you know like how do people claim

301
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,360
that they are making these crosses that

302
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,100
you know like for example like blue

303
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,459
dream you have 20 different [ __ ] blue

304
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,920
Dreams yeah and like you know a little

305
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,899
bit about me like my background is in

306
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,578
like genetics and botany and all that

307
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,100
and

308
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,778
um you know more so population genetics

309
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,778
and it's you're going to college for

310
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:36,778
this your University yeah I went yeah I

311
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:40,078
got my degree uh two years ago and that

312
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:41,700
um and so you know like instinctually I

313
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,519
kind of just thought okay like these

314
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,680
people say they have like you know this

315
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,980
blue dream or whatever

316
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,299
um it's like you know what's to say that

317
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,980
they're all gonna be the same you know

318
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,199
you have different pollen donors you

319
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,440
have different like you know uh pollen

320
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,180
receivers and all that so it's like

321
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,980
who's to see what's what and I I think

322
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,379
that's kind of like what struck like the

323
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,200
whole like provenance type of like you

324
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:10,200
know understanding it like knowing that

325
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,500
like not anyone is just gonna give you

326
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,899
what they say it is you know because it

327
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,759
the sad truth of it is is like it's a

328
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,379
it's a sketchy scene you know there are

329
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,039
sketchy people

330
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:23,639
um

331
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:25,559
but yeah and you know as a little time

332
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,899
went on like I began to get a little

333
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,518
interested in history and that's kind of

334
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,019
like when I stumbled upon this podcast

335
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,759
yeah

336
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,039
um I listened to the first episode and

337
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,338
like I believe you gave crybaby a shout

338
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,078
out yeah um that's right like just a

339
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,920
little after that I joined breeder

340
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,239
Syndicate and like yeah I mean it kind

341
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,958
of went from there

342
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,959
um

343
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,958
right

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,299
um luckily I was like

345
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,159
um

346
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,679
adopted into like a good Community

347
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,899
relatively early on

348
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,699
um so like I didn't have to go through

349
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,620
like any [ __ ] or anything or like

350
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,100
get my [ __ ] hopes and dreams Crush

351
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,339
like some of these other people do and

352
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,440
yeah at the end of it like

353
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,800
I mean you see these dogs they're almost

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,800
in the days when they hear about like

355
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,019
Our Heroes being Tweakers snitches and

356
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,479
stuff yeah crazy and yeah the crazy

357
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,278
thing is it's like it's you know we're

358
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,379
all humans and it's like I feel like we

359
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,899
should all be true to ourselves and it's

360
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,059
like you know by claiming all these

361
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,039
things you're like lying to yourself and

362
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,859
and what good is that you know a lot of

363
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,039
delusion uh yeah exactly and it's kind

364
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,659
of sad I guess

365
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:45,120
what's cool about the server here is

366
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:48,179
like like I remember when I I was early

367
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,399
on in there but like everybody has

368
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,679
bought [ __ ] you know everybody's been

369
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,059
taken and like it's not like there's

370
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,039
people in there that are very

371
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,899
experienced that are like never had that

372
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:00,059
happen everyone's had that hell yeah you

373
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,980
know and that's where it's like

374
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,899
some people take it super personally

375
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,879
some people are super invested

376
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,059
financially and emotionally

377
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,220
but I mean when the when open

378
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,679
conversations happen and it's like look

379
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,379
like this is kind of what we know

380
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,179
and it's not the greatest thing to hear

381
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,278
like

382
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,078
I mean it's I don't understand when

383
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,179
people just don't want to hear it they

384
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,638
don't want to accept it or they're they

385
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,620
start fights over it or

386
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,860
you know

387
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,139
I I was not like that I don't like being

388
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,720
wrong to help me be right like that's

389
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,278
get me there well understanding is the

390
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,959
most important part right it's not about

391
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,698
who good and who's bad and who's this

392
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,159
and who you know it's just understanding

393
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,299
situations and like you said humanizing

394
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,600
people like

395
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,799
like nobody's perfect you know there's

396
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,540
in the person in the world that's

397
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,419
perfect there's another person in the

398
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:58,319
world that hasn't done a stupid thing or

399
00:14:54,419 --> 00:15:00,479
misstep or whatever but like

400
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,579
people that are actively like learning

401
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
and trying to move forward it's like

402
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,299
they're moving forward you know yeah

403
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,219
always

404
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,198
yeah you know one of the biggest

405
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,759
problems that I found since local you're

406
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,519
like a

407
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,879
um a university type dude was like I'm

408
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,698
still having trouble communicating with

409
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,100
University people on on the level of

410
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:25,139
like their geneticists their botanists

411
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,778
they understand breeding it in these

412
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:30,480
deep levels but trying to communicate to

413
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:33,000
them the history of cannabis

414
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,000
how we came to to the conclusions that

415
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,919
we have why we're there and why it

416
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,720
matters to what they're doing and why

417
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,519
they need to know this stuff before they

418
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,139
start like doing these tests on these

419
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,820
strains and comparing The Strain To The

420
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,919
Strain and why they need to know all

421
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,500
this stuff like how do we how do you

422
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,599
tell people that are obviously much more

423
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,458
educated and smart you know in their own

424
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,500
mind than we are

425
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,838
um how do you how do you explain that to

426
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,820
them what would you do from Europe

427
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,720
it's kind of a hard question but I mean

428
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:06,240
yeah it is a complex question I mean you

429
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,519
know I I after all like I just got my

430
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,740
undergrad like I'm now a PhD or like

431
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,320
like any means but like there's

432
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,139
definitely intentions for that yeah

433
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,019
um but like I don't know I I think it's

434
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,139
really hard for them to kind of accept

435
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,519
us somewhat and maybe it's because you

436
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,740
know we're just a bunch of Deeds that

437
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,539
like smoke weed and nerd out about you

438
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,060
know [ __ ] that doesn't really matter to

439
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:31,860
the world even though it does yeah

440
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,719
um and that's like one thing I kind of

441
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,759
joked about like with people like when

442
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,620
they ask like oh hey what do you do as a

443
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,778
botanist and I was like oh yeah like I

444
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,120
study this you know it you know it

445
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:43,799
doesn't matter in the grand scheme of

446
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,320
things but to me it's really interesting

447
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,758
so yeah I'm gonna say [ __ ] it and do it

448
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,100
you know

449
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,959
um but I think like one way to maybe get

450
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,300
like attention of some scientists is

451
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:57,299
maybe trying to like integrate some of

452
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:59,879
like maybe the hypotheses that like we

453
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:02,338
have maybe a about certain families of

454
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,519
plants you know or groups of plants you

455
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,620
know like how can we integrate this into

456
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,259
like how they're studying like what

457
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,239
they're studying so like for example the

458
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,619
professor that I was studying under at

459
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,720
my school

460
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,759
um she was interested in plant breeding

461
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,959
systems so like you know how like wheat

462
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,338
is is a [ __ ] dialysis right you know

463
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,459
you have your your male and your female

464
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:29,700
plants well you know she was studying

465
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,558
plants that were uh gyno dioces which

466
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,419
are female and like you know

467
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,819
hermaphroditic plants even their true

468
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,860
males so it's like you know I think

469
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:40,558
there are ways to kind of integrate like

470
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,699
studies between like the two topics so

471
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,660
it's like I think it's more about

472
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:48,960
relating it to their topic of study than

473
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,820
you know trying to achieve this goal you

474
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,160
know maybe just sequencing DNA or

475
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,359
whatever to see if it's related to me

476
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,340
like it's like

477
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,139
I look at them at what they're doing and

478
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,418
I'm like how can you even waste your

479
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,280
time sequencing the DNA of this blue

480
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:06,059
dream cut that you went to Source from a

481
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:07,619
collective that you say 95 of the cuts

482
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:09,240
are similar to this one but it's

483
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,798
probably not even [ __ ] blue dream why

484
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,538
are you wasting your time because that's

485
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,980
not even having anything to do that

486
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:15,660
everybody in history is talking about

487
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,579
and that you're going to be comparing

488
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,580
this data to you know

489
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,099
we have to also consider that we need to

490
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,660
have information on what the parents

491
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:29,459
actually were it's not like you can just

492
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,380
take what what was it like a [ __ ]

493
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,419
Super Silver Haze and a blueberry like

494
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,860
you can't do sequences too separately

495
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:39,960
and expect it exactly to be related to

496
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:41,119
the blue dream that they sequence so

497
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,140
it's

498
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,879
obviously they're there they don't even

499
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,860
understand that part like they don't

500
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,539
know for sure and it seems to me it's so

501
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,619
scientifically obvious like if you're

502
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:51,240
going to start at a place you're gonna

503
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,979
[ __ ] crawl back up to the parent line

504
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,900
maybe you should figure this [ __ ] up out

505
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,900
along the way but like their their ideas

506
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,860
were like basically we don't think or

507
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,140
what

508
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,819
the most common sentiment I'm getting

509
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,679
from them I shouldn't say all of them

510
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:08,038
the most common sentiment I've gotten

511
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,419
from multiple people in that field is

512
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,419
how do you know you're right

513
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,980
that so that's that's I guess the beauty

514
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,419
of science you know like yeah and that's

515
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,279
what I've been trying to work on like

516
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,400
interpreting like or not interpreting

517
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,220
using the Bayes theorem to bring in to

518
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,620
to actually working that into how we

519
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,960
approach history and how we prove past

520
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:33,538
historical events

521
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,980
um within reason and within science and

522
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,279
I think like that's something that I've

523
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,058
been looking at as it's used in other

524
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,099
um

525
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,480
like in ancient religions and stuff to

526
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,399
prove what happened in ancient religions

527
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,558
even though all we have is texts you

528
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,720
know yeah and that's really the key

529
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,399
honestly like you know people who

530
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,140
witness certain events you know like

531
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,480
primary sources and all that you know

532
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,100
like uh primary sources are I mean

533
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,200
sometimes going to be some of the most

534
00:19:56,099 --> 00:20:00,480
valuable sources but you know obviously

535
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,519
those may be biased defending yeah for

536
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,440
sure you know as you've seen dude like

537
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,480
we've seen firsthand like the best

538
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,538
primary sources and then it gets kind of

539
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,720
screwy yeah I know yeah yeah yeah

540
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:14,099
um but yeah like I mean I I feel I feel

541
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,660
awesome knowing that there's actually

542
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,819
like this theorem that people have

543
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,759
figured out that helps prove history

544
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:23,279
when it's based on written evidence in

545
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,500
the past it's pretty cool

546
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,899
uh for reference it was Dr Richard

547
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,819
carrier in

548
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,340
um one second I want to make sure I give

549
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:36,720
him credit for this because it is a

550
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:39,298
pretty uh uh it was proving history and

551
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,160
on the proving history

552
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:43,200
yeah I think that's what it is Richard

553
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,019
carrier proving history

554
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,058
yeah and the Science World is like the

555
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,918
type of world that like if it's not on

556
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:51,660
paper it's

557
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,820
you know exactly probably not going to

558
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,860
be real so you know that's another thing

559
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:59,460
to take into consideration you know when

560
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,899
you close my mind why do these tests if

561
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,798
none of that matters why even do the

562
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,620
tests

563
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,660
like it's you know it at that point it's

564
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,339
[ __ ] with ethics and it's like if

565
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,100
this is really something that they

566
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,779
wanted to per se uh integrate into like

567
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:15,298
Pharmaceuticals and stuff it's like

568
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:17,519
you're also [ __ ] with that yeah yeah

569
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:19,259
if if you want to make it medicine then

570
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,000
you need the data that people use but

571
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,319
you need to go access that data that

572
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,700
people had you need to know what they

573
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,759
were smoking at the time not what you

574
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,860
think yeah yeah and that but it just I

575
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,900
don't know it's it's been a long long

576
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,399
drawn out process trying to have these

577
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,000
conversations with these University

578
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,220
professors and phds and then it's still

579
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,220
gotten to me I feel like it's gotten not

580
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,360
very far yeah and you'd hope things

581
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,419
would get better with Federal

582
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:47,339
legalization but I just feel like it's

583
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,120
still gonna be rather tricky to conduct

584
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,480
any

585
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,459
kind of like a ecological based studies

586
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,380
like I feel like it's gonna take I feel

587
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,298
like it's going to take someone at that

588
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,820
just happens to get into the head of one

589
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:02,839
of these programs to end up being a

590
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,839
massive C nerd

591
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,599
actually gain interest in history and

592
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,100
really dive in and that's like a dice

593
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,980
roll because look at how few of us there

594
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:16,980
are in cannabis let alone this is a tiny

595
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,679
Community it really is yeah

596
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:24,538
what's your thoughts on it pack

597
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,280
oh um uh you caught me off guard here we

598
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,500
were just talking about the the trying

599
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,619
to talk to the university people about

600
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,140
why why they need to take

601
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:36,178
the history of strange seriously before

602
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,820
they start trying to [ __ ] with

603
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,519
sequencing and doing all that

604
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:43,079
um sure chasing it I I just have a real

605
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,599
hard time communicating with them on it

606
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:47,759
and if you know

607
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,918
I'm not sure if it's the Lost in

608
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,019
Translation possibly you know not having

609
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,780
the the same kind of reference point to

610
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,918
be able to speak their language uh you

611
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,839
know maybe it's something along those

612
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,080
lines but I I would imagine anybody

613
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:03,359
who's truly you know stepping up to the

614
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,339
plate from a scientific practitioner

615
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,418
level they're going to want to consider

616
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:11,220
you know all variables right and

617
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,320
you know

618
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,019
just the fact that it's been taboo to

619
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,178
research you know I wonder

620
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,918
you know people have kind of become my

621
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,840
optic or sort of conditioned into their

622
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,179
own as much as scientists are up and

623
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,399
they're also you know not looking along

624
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:29,340
their own agenda for things and so how

625
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,140
you how you kind of introduce uh another

626
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:34,319
lens to look there is a good question

627
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:38,179
some of these people even smoke which is

628
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:41,399
like okay so you've been smoking forever

629
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,600
I don't know I don't know it's just one

630
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,038
of those Stone thoughts they're not

631
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,158
they're not smoking the right [ __ ] it's

632
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,779
a problem exactly so one of the things I

633
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,640
also wanted to get into was one of the

634
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:53,158
number one questions we get asked and we

635
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,860
have you know we have me and pack on

636
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,500
here and we have Shawnee and local was

637
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:00,859
males people have questions about males

638
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,538
all the time Shawnee

639
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:04,678
load up some mail questions like that

640
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:08,579
you think people would want to know

641
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,679
about local users load them up

642
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,359
well like

643
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,298
um

644
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,979
like number one right like like if

645
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,440
you're looking for a male and you like

646
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,538
to use a male

647
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,340
the only way you know is if you grow The

648
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:26,038
Offspring and observe the females

649
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:27,899
correct correct yeah

650
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,538
so I mean like

651
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,820
this I read this article and like me and

652
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:34,740
crybaby had a little conversation

653
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:37,798
about it

654
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,359
um but like what the first question that

655
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:42,240
popped into my head was like how many

656
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,339
how many Elite males exist today like

657
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,019
how many people are holding males that

658
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:48,178
they breed with that they've been like

659
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:51,000
held on to for a significant amount of

660
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:54,659
time yeah and uh the answer was pretty

661
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,058
low right yeah very very low

662
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:01,080
very low I don't think that there's a

663
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:03,000
lot of um revisiting with certain males

664
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,439
um I think people when they do it they

665
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,779
tend to select another male from the

666
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,340
seed line it's very hard to do I know

667
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:12,000
when we were keeping Mel's alive over

668
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:14,819
the years before uh the moon situation

669
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,558
um it would it's just constant repotting

670
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:19,139
making sure the pot's big enough making

671
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,019
sure your mail isn't flowering uh my

672
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,140
bedroom is constantly 24 7. like just 24

673
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:27,058
on there's never any kind of darkness in

674
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,919
my bedroom because of males constantly

675
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,178
trying to keep males around second they

676
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,679
hit the bottom of the pot they'd always

677
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,360
start flowering in there and if it's in

678
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,919
the same location as a female room that

679
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,178
could be a serious problem like if

680
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,220
you're trying to take meals alive while

681
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,320
also making seeds of something else with

682
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,659
another meal that's not really that good

683
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,178
it's not it's not beneficial so you

684
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,620
always have to learn on the fly over

685
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,980
time when it comes to stuff like that

686
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:51,719
using special dance really isolating

687
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,000
um still not advised to keep them in the

688
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,740
same room but yeah it's why you don't

689
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,579
see it very often there's like the haze

690
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,620
Haze AC mil that were real famous

691
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:03,178
um we kept the blue bonnet went alive

692
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:06,058
for a long time and it was over at Radio

693
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,759
Ridge until we got hplv and now it's no

694
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:10,200
longer with us but we tried we tried to

695
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,759
keep it alive to pass out for other

696
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,640
people to do blueberry work that was the

697
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,440
intent yeah it's not that common and um

698
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,580
I think the first question I get the

699
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,620
most is

700
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:22,918
what do you look for When selecting a

701
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:25,699
male uh the number one

702
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,700
well like

703
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:29,759
they're pretty much all myths though

704
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,240
right or not myths but like they're not

705
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:36,538
all like 100 confirmed sort of I mean it

706
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,900
just like if you okay like back in the

707
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:42,480
day I remember when I started I was told

708
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:45,000
by by the Hunts breath guy

709
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,259
if you want to find a male you want to

710
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,298
look for the one that looks most like

711
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,158
the female and grows most like a female

712
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:51,839
and the one you think is least like a

713
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,059
male in the end

714
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,379
like it looks like a female and at the

715
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:56,639
very last minute you realize oh it's a

716
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,640
male and that's a one so for a long time

717
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,020
I just did that you know and then as I I

718
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,538
started going I was like I'm not really

719
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,099
getting anything anywhere by doing that

720
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,778
like it's not doing anything special for

721
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,519
me like I I didn't know if I was trying

722
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:09,659
to just make sure there was no Herms at

723
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,740
the beginning is that what I'm trying to

724
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,000
do because that seems to be what people

725
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,359
complain about the most you just don't

726
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,380
want herbs you know yeah and as you're

727
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,178
doing this stuff you're seeing different

728
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,980
traits pop out right and then you see

729
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,419
certain things from from the mail land

730
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,460
certain Leaf shapes certain certain

731
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,400
serrations like oh wait that's a trade I

732
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,259
can identify you know and slowly you

733
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,559
kind of realize

734
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:34,079
there's not just one male one trait one

735
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,178
one it's like trying to constantly fit a

736
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,099
square peg in a circle you know like if

737
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,659
you if you're looking for the same trait

738
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:42,058
in every male you're trying to fit a

739
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,740
square peg in a circle like if when it

740
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,418
came to the blue bonnet stuff it was

741
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,099
like I wanted blueberry versions of

742
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:51,120
everything if I want that I'm not going

743
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,740
to go to a to I don't know Apple mates

744
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,959
or whatever and and try to make that

745
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,778
Mail work you know and just until it

746
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,940
works it's just not how it works so um

747
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:00,659
yeah I mean when you're selecting for a

748
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,640
mail

749
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,860
you've got to start somewhere

750
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,960
sometimes it's as easy as one two three

751
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,879
roll a dice pick one if you don't know

752
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,519
anything about the line

753
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,559
um it's a lot easier to know a line grow

754
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,940
the line out know the females and that

755
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,619
way when you start seeing these males

756
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,298
pop out you can see their counterparts

757
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:20,339
in the female slowly but surely with

758
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:22,679
what traits line up with both of them

759
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:24,240
and uh yeah that's the best advice know

760
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,340
your line before you work it know your

761
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,778
line know your line before you choose a

762
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,359
male and and it'll tell you everything

763
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,159
you don't have to have any questions I

764
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,538
think I think your intentions you know

765
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,720
say a lot to you I mean if you're

766
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:39,480
somebody who's really trying to go deep

767
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,880
and uh you know you got the means uh

768
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,519
space wise time wise and what have you

769
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,159
to to go that way then sure you know but

770
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,720
if let's say you just grab a bag of

771
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,120
seeds right and you pop it you got a

772
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,740
couple nails and you know you're not a

773
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,538
lifer necessarily but you want to mess

774
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,400
around

775
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:58,619
um or even like open pollination

776
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,419
situations right sure

777
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,219
um you can open Parliament with more

778
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:06,000
than one male you don't have to have

779
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:08,038
12 males in there if you have a 4x4 sure

780
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,240
there's like all kinds of consideration

781
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,859
in terms of what you're trying to get

782
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,538
into as well yeah it's what you're

783
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,459
trying to achieve are you trying to make

784
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:16,140
seeds for sale are you trying to make it

785
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,579
just to learn the line I mean there's

786
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,620
all kinds of different reasons and

787
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:21,418
appropriate uses of things like that

788
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:23,579
sure yeah you may not have an

789
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,380
opportunity to go through five males and

790
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,480
and grow out all their Prodigy and

791
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,820
continue to select and figure out how to

792
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,819
you know dial it in the way you want so

793
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:37,319
that makes a lot of sense what about you

794
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,460
local you have any questions on males

795
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:45,839
yeah right yes yeah the question is like

796
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:48,600
how is one maybe able to distinguish

797
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,418
um one to let's say pull a mail from it

798
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,639
you know the original F1 versus maybe

799
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:56,399
pulling a male for breeding later down

800
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,080
in the generation like are are there

801
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,178
instances like where people actually

802
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,480
like you know move a line forward to

803
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,519
select a mail or like

804
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,798
it just seems really odd yeah

805
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,379
when I I can't think of a situation

806
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,898
unless I was like doing

807
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,299
like parallel breeding where I'm working

808
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:17,339
two two different expressions from the

809
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:19,440
same line then I would choose a male at

810
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:20,759
like F5 to cross to a male like F5 up

811
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,019
here that's it that's a good case you're

812
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,278
doing something like that like going

813
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,898
down she's in the mail up here as

814
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,859
opposed to down here

815
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,500
um

816
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:31,319
mm-hmm I I can't really think of any

817
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,079
situation where I would purposely choose

818
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:36,240
like an F3 male over an F1 mail for any

819
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,038
situation

820
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,558
I'm sure there are occasions where that

821
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:42,839
comes up but I can't think of one

822
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,639
um I mean yeah I guess maybe the only

823
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,678
instance I could think of is maybe

824
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,559
pulling like a male from an F2 because

825
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,059
it is your you know largest window for

826
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,460
selection

827
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:55,740
you know and maybe you to just bring

828
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,558
diverse more diversity yeah maybe yeah

829
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,179
but

830
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:01,139
but yeah I don't know usually yeah the

831
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,179
thing is usually if I'm working

832
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,620
something in my mind if I'm working

833
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,440
something forward I'm only going forward

834
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:09,778
for uniformity yeah of a trait never for

835
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,278
diversity but I'm sure like if someone

836
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,140
had like

837
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,200
10 seeds of a line that might actually

838
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,220
be a decent thing to do you know like

839
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,500
and with me when it comes to open

840
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,798
pollinations like I'm I'm All or Nothing

841
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,359
with open pollinations it's like yeah I

842
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,700
have to leave all the males in there

843
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,199
with all the females or one male one

844
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,740
female

845
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,140
um or or one male all females

846
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,558
um and that's only because like I feel

847
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,299
like if you're doing any kind of pulling

848
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:40,859
out based on like oh this thing's

849
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:42,778
harming that let's all remove that one

850
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:44,519
I'm artificially selecting just one

851
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:46,140
little thing away from that pool it's

852
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,940
only one little thing but I'm taking

853
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,020
away a trait you know I think it's not a

854
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,159
great trait but I'm taking it away but

855
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:51,960
it might be a link trait to something

856
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,419
very special in that line and you might

857
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,798
have just pulled it so so that's the

858
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,419
only time I would say like it's more

859
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,398
beneficial to have all the males versus

860
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,720
just choosing a few but if it's a space

861
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,000
consideration like pack was talking

862
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,620
about that's an excellent time when it's

863
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,419
like you know like you're not probably

864
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:07,500
not even making seeds to sell at that

865
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,820
point but you're trying to go through

866
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,819
the line that's a perfect time to you

867
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:13,558
know use what works for you you know

868
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,538
whatever's going to help you get through

869
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,619
that line more to understand it more

870
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:18,619
perfect case for it

871
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,220
I mean you know most people nowadays

872
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:26,460
dude are in it for themselves right um

873
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,740
yeah and this idea of like it being

874
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,058
you know a lifestyle versus like a

875
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,319
window of opportunity you have to jump

876
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:32,819
through

877
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,619
you know what I'm saying that kind of

878
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,740
separates the men from the boys I guess

879
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,979
like the ones

880
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,359
it always has yeah

881
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,240
like when somebody gets the opportunity

882
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,879
to [ __ ] [ __ ] you over to try and make

883
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,019
the situation better it happened all the

884
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,580
time

885
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,579
like you know

886
00:32:53,538 --> 00:33:01,019
it ruins friendships man

887
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:02,398
Yeah well yeah yeah yeah what's the

888
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,139
difference between the long timers and

889
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,000
the short term timers in cannabis you

890
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,520
know like being in being in the seed

891
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,798
scene for over 15 years now I've watched

892
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,200
a revolving door of characters some of

893
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,058
them the most popular dudes you couldn't

894
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,860
imagine the biggest top of the scene

895
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:19,859
totally gone no one even remembers them

896
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:22,558
anymore you know um yeah it flashes in

897
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,298
the pan like that happen all the time

898
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,778
there's a high turnover rate in cannabis

899
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:29,879
at very few are people that have been in

900
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,440
it longer than 10 years in the seed

901
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,720
scene that have lasted that long and

902
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,278
that are still going through researching

903
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,860
trying to find the truth doing all that

904
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,079
