00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,299
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,039
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,839
cannabis strain history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,058
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,358
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,140
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,118
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,640
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,379
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,060
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,379
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,280
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,280
to the underground

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,878
hey everyone welcome to reader Syndicate

19
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:46,619
I'm Matthew here with my co-host

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,000
thousandfold and today we're going to

21
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,659
unlock and unfold some of the

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,719
nomenclature with some examples and

23
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,939
hypotheticals on different strains to

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,760
try to give people a better idea past

25
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:03,358
just the the term F1 and F2 and all that

26
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:06,539
and just brief ideas of what it means

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,060
yeah yeah because last week we you know

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,700
we did a fairly textbook overview of

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,799
various Concepts in breeding Theory and

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,060
Science and so this week we're

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,659
definitely getting

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,519
um

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,580
more concrete we're definitely getting

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,140
into some of the actual real life

35
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,359
examples

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,640
um of breeding and different real life

37
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,579
scenarios

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,618
and yeah I thought I think one way we

39
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:37,438
can begin is we did talk briefly about

40
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,819
uh for example last week how

41
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,879
we don't

42
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,219
it's rare to find a true F1 hybrid in

43
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,078
cannabis for example and we talked about

44
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,679
how

45
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,938
um that mendelian model of uh true F1

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,618
hybrids

47
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:57,599
and then F2 gen with uh

48
00:01:54,618 --> 00:02:01,500
genotypic segregation

49
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,000
doesn't happen really in cannabis so I

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,239
think Matt wanted to address some of

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,560
that and we can start with the F1 Matt

52
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,120
yeah you know

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,800
um what are examples of f1s in our world

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,140
and how to actually make them

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,680
so I'll start really with what they

56
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:22,979
should be and how they would be made in

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,780
terms of uh actual agricultural breeding

58
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,119
versus cannabis

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,000
so the definition of an F1 we went over

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,520
that last week it's it's Crossing two

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,318
distinctly different genotypes

62
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,379
um together essentially right like

63
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:41,159
you're Crossing two stabilized genotypes

64
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:43,318
together is the idea but um yeah two

65
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,419
distinctly different specifically that's

66
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,299
very very key because in cannabis it's

67
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,939
used differently so in this idea you

68
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,360
would want to take a Thailand race

69
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:57,419
um something very very long flowering

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,459
tie for example or Burmese or any of

71
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,939
that kind of stuff and cross it to

72
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:08,400
something traditionally more Afghani

73
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:10,800
that's interbred or um in this example

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,379
let's say any Afghani will do any

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,700
Afghani will do from like uh a land race

76
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:21,000
region so that would be a real F1 hybrid

77
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:23,219
and by Crossing those two inbred lines

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,259
that's where you would get hybrid Vigor

79
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,139
and that's why people when people talk

80
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,939
about hypervigor and cannabis and it

81
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,919
doesn't really necessarily apply because

82
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,719
cannabis is naturally vigorous anyways

83
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,018
and most of the things that we see in

84
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,719
cannabis are poly hybrids so what we see

85
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,120
in cannabis when we see f1s typically

86
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,098
and even I use this this way because

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,900
it's it's how it's commonly understood

88
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,459
in trying to

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,140
make it anything different even by

90
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,939
calling it a polyhybrid F1 it would

91
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,619
totally confuse everyone and it does

92
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,840
when you do it

93
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,180
um as people understand it is that it is

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,000
just two different strains crossed to

95
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,599
each other in cannabis simply put two

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,699
different unrelated strains uh and in

97
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,919
some cases even related

98
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,079
yeah yeah and technically though that is

99
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,958
correct to still call those f1s

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,219
um we're just distinguishing that from

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,418
the

102
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:20,699
uh true F1 hybrids type F1 right correct

103
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,139
I mean it's it's a commonly accepted I

104
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,460
don't know if it's correct I don't know

105
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,100
if it's even correct to call it correct

106
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,959
but it's accepted I think it is yeah I

107
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,580
think it is I I think I did look that up

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,120
to be like

109
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,120
for police

110
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,320
for like yeah heterozygous or polyhybrid

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,720
crosses I think they're still

112
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,579
technically f1s but uh okay we'll just

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,680
say that we're not entirely sure but

114
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,899
yeah yeah I mean it's just it's just

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,519
because f1s have to be two distinct

116
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,638
genotypes I don't know how they just

117
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,159
scrub that for heterozy I guess

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,220
because it's a major question

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,439
I think that F1 still designates the

120
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,320
filial Generation generation regardless

121
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,000
distinct from yeah yeah exactly okay so

122
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,860
then it is we if if that's the case then

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,339
it's being used correcting cannabis if

124
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,840
that's the case and um yeah so in this

125
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,478
example

126
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:16,079
um most people would say like

127
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,000
uh OG Kush cross to purple Urkel

128
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,800
whatever if they're seed lines you know

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,100
male female seed lines you would call

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,879
that an F1 in cannabis

131
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,639
um a great example of a real F1 in

132
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,620
cannabis is I see it would be something

133
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,500
that CSI is currently working on which

134
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,259
is his uh land race Burmese that was

135
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,199
from preservation dude and Crossing that

136
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:43,979
to the Christmas tree Bud

137
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,020
um IBL line which is it is to the point

138
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:47,699
of where if you if you pop seedlings

139
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,918
from it and you run clothes of those

140
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,720
seedlings of each different seedling at

141
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,639
the clonal level they all look pretty

142
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,620
uniform you know it's it's different

143
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,360
when they're seedlings and seedlings as

144
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,459
most people know seedlings like as they

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,819
grow up and mature and you take clones

146
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,799
of them they change they like the Clone

147
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,259
is not usually the same exact plant that

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,538
this evening is it's very rare and in

149
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,280
clonal form they all seem to line up

150
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,319
pretty well looking like clones of each

151
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,379
other so it is it is a

152
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,360
I think IBL by definition for cannabis

153
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,300
so that would be a good example of a

154
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,180
true F1 hybrid in cannabis

155
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,699
yeah yeah and just to clarify I think

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,379
what we're trying to point out is that

157
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,478
when F1 is

158
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,579
when the term F1 is used there are

159
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,418
actually two possible

160
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:39,478
interpretations or uh meanings

161
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:41,159
one of that is the true F1 hybrid in the

162
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,579
mendelian sense that Matt's trying to

163
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,400
get at and then there is F1 in in in

164
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:50,698
designating the filial generation

165
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,859
and nothing beyond that so in cannabis

166
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,978
most of the time it is the latter

167
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,199
uh but yeah they are exceptions like the

168
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,060
one that just gave yes there's always

169
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,460
exceptions to every rule on that and

170
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,199
cannabis it always finds a way to have

171
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,279
an exception

172
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,900
yep

173
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,879
okay

174
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,299
um how about an F2

175
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,478
so F2 essentially is taking uh the the

176
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,879
progeny the resulting seeds or progeny

177
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:21,478
um of that F1 hybrid popping those seeds

178
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,519
selecting a male and a female or

179
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,860
essentially a male and a female

180
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,918
um to keep it simple a male and a female

181
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,098
and Crossing them together

182
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:31,098
foreign

183
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,038
the second filial generation and and as

184
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,478
it goes on to F3 F4 F5 it's just that

185
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,399
same process each Next Generation

186
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,478
selected male or female but the next

187
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,638
generation and hopefully you're

188
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,439
selecting for traits if you're working

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,300
them Generations

190
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,418
um that usually helps take it a

191
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,419
Direction

192
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,918
yeah

193
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,560
um is there are there good examples of

194
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,198
f2s or like F2 is being used for you

195
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,098
know particular

196
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:07,860
reasons okay so um uh an example of an

197
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:11,038
F2 would be like with the blue bonnet I

198
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,680
got so few seeds of the F1 to pop that I

199
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,779
wanted to immediately do f2s of it

200
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,780
um and that was to open it up and see

201
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:21,659
what what's actually in the blue bonnet

202
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,878
um yeah that that's that that's the

203
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,800
perfect example of why you would take

204
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,020
something to an F2

205
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,020
um and I didn't necessarily want to open

206
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,639
up the whole thing per se like by doing

207
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,259
an open pollination because I already

208
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,699
knew the direction I wanted to go and

209
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,158
they were already showing those traits

210
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,599
so

211
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,120
hopefully that helps make sense with

212
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,158
that yeah and and then if twos like

213
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,620
we've mentioned before that's where

214
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,379
you're likely to see a greater

215
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,620
proportion of recessives

216
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:56,220
um and greater uh

217
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,399
a greater kind of uh variation in the

218
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,080
permutations of of genes right like

219
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,059
anxieties

220
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,259
yeah yep

221
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,759
cool

222
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,338
all right I think the next one we want

223
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,080
to move on to was the S1

224
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,140
S1 and I think there are many many

225
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,000
examples of this yeah so that would be

226
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,039
specifically self and a lot of people

227
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,320
get this confused they think all femini

228
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,519
seeds are s ones

229
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:27,360
whereas all s1s are feminized

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,339
it's true vice vice versa is not

231
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,839
um so an S1 means self it's when you

232
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,500
take a

233
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:37,080
essentially take a clone of another of a

234
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,139
single plant you take two clones you

235
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,240
reverse one using any number of methods

236
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,699
to to cause it to show male flowers you

237
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,500
pollinate another clone of itself and

238
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,560
harvest the resulting seeds that would

239
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,360
be a self-generation good examples of a

240
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,838
self-generation would be like the the

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,000
chem 91 s1s from CSI

242
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,260
um the heirloom Afghani s ones that I

243
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,620
did

244
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:04,500
um and essentially it you do get to see

245
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,080
the recessives despite it being

246
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,458
self so a lot of people like to compare

247
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,220
the S1 generation to the F2 Generation

248
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:16,379
because you're seeing the recessives

249
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,480
however you're still narrowing stuff

250
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,419
down while seeing the recessives in an

251
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,639
S2 whereas in an F2 that's not

252
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,319
necessarily what's happening all the

253
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,500
time you might miss one right nice too

254
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,140
yeah yeah yeah

255
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,940
God I'm gonna suck it's gonna get these

256
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,039
yeah well I was going to say as well

257
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,640
while you are also likely to find

258
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,919
recesses in US ones you also have a

259
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,620
chance of finding things very much like

260
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:46,139
the plan you're reversing

261
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,820
you have a chance to find things very

262
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,039
similar

263
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,320
um a lot of people understand it to mean

264
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,360
that you're going to find exact copies

265
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
of and that's that's definitely not the

266
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,759
case

267
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,920
um but you'll find things very similar

268
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,000
and some may look identical you know but

269
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,278
it doesn't necessarily mean it's an

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,159
exact genetic con I mean it's worth

271
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,078
saying this right like any any seeds

272
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,778
that you make regardless of how you make

273
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,578
them you will never ever get genetically

274
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:14,338
identical

275
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,919
progeny yeah I mean and it's like this

276
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,079
with humans when I impregnate myself the

277
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,360
resulting babies don't look like me I've

278
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,419
tried this and it doesn't work very well

279
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,339
I I struggle to imagine what they would

280
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,578
look like beautiful though they're

281
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,579
beautiful

282
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,139
okay

283
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,019
all right um and also you know uh worth

284
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,879
mentioning we have obviously addressed

285
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:43,620
reversals uh and not just reversals

286
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,958
we've addressed self in quite a bit so

287
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,519
yep if you want to hear more about it

288
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,099
definitely reference the last two

289
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,339
episodes we we talk about selfing in

290
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,459
both of them and the next set of

291
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,079
examples the S2s

292
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,979
twos

293
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,739
um

294
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,139
trying to think you know actually I as I

295
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,240
gave an example for S1 for the chem91 S

296
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,799
ones more than likely those are actually

297
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,259
S2s

298
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,019
yes I want you to point that out too so

299
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,700
I I think while it is a great example of

300
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,919
like

301
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,259
a release of an S1 I probably should

302
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,240
have referenced something like

303
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,919
Jesus not even I was thinking geez the

304
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,539
last ones but that's probably an S2 too

305
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,899
so it's like there's a lot of things out

306
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:30,360
there from clones that we buy as s1s

307
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,419
that might be S2s but because

308
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,360
uh history hasn't quite proven out bad

309
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,458
out to be fleshed out like for sure

310
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,379
they're labeled as what we know them to

311
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,899
be which would be the first true

312
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,338
self-generation that we can prove right

313
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,740
so that's in that case they would be

314
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,740
referred to as s1s but in theory some of

315
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,079
that stuff is S2s and as a good example

316
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,899
probably Ken 91 because it's so uniform

317
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,599
as an S1 is a good example of why it is

318
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,179
probably an S2 but you don't see a lot

319
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,519
of real S2s being released or sold

320
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,078
um so that's why I'm kind of stretching

321
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,700
it a bit to try to find something that

322
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,620
really fits in right there

323
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,019
I think there's there's a cool General

324
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,578
point in there though which is that

325
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,399
if you don't know what you're starting

326
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:16,319
with you what you what you're like um

327
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,899
starting material actually is what

328
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,079
generation it actually is uh the best

329
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,659
you get in cannabis land is a relative

330
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,899
kind of designation so a reboot not

331
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:29,699
knowing what the chem91 actually is or

332
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,879
we can say when yourself is that it is

333
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,740
an S1 quote unquote but in actuality it

334
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,200
may be interesting but you know because

335
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,419
we don't know and in reference to that

336
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,839
the blue bonnet itself was supposed to

337
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:45,899
be a a blueberry Pure Line worked you

338
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,480
know and if you go by who had it you

339
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,240
know DJ's short I think to Vic or to

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,240
Tony from Sager math though to Vic High

341
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,919
to Lone Star to me that's a lot of

342
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,579
generations that were worked in there I

343
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,599
mean DJ released it at F4 and supposedly

344
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:03,899
um you know I mean there's many

345
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,240
generations in there so

346
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,620
it's it's really hard to say on that

347
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,320
like

348
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,700
what generation it really was

349
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,339
yeah

350
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,200
yeah and coming back to this twos um has

351
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,839
our old mate Caleb

352
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,360
done this to work or is he I know he's

353
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,519
talked about it before yeah he has but

354
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,200
it's not often released so it's kind of

355
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,578
hard to reference it but yeah there's

356
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,339
been there's been several things he's

357
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:31,500
done and taken to S3 where the the

358
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:35,040
population of seed seems to just be

359
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,240
unviable like they don't pop at S3

360
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,039
um I don't think that's always the case

361
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,959
but it has happened

362
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,939
yeah yeah

363
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,838
okay very cool

364
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,899
all right next one is the f1r

365
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,600
f1r so yeah what is that that's a

366
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,759
designation that we use in cannabis

367
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,699
specifically and it's only to denote

368
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:00,539
reversal so that when us as breeders and

369
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:03,659
like this is not science talk now this

370
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:06,480
is like for sure our own nomenclature

371
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:08,278
that we instituted right so it's it's so

372
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,379
when breeders are looking at stuff we

373
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:12,059
know if we're referencing if I'm looking

374
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:14,639
at someone's writing I know if they're

375
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,559
referencing a male in their line or if

376
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,079
they're referencing a reversal on their

377
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,638
line by that designation so it's

378
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,439
something that we started doing so that

379
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,820
we know in each other's work what we're

380
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,040
referring to if we're going to work with

381
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,300
each other's work and hopefully more

382
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,039
people will institute it over time

383
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,719
because it's very helpful and it's

384
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,939
important and it gets more and more

385
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,500
important as more people come in I mean

386
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,540
just as important as trying to

387
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,539
illustrate that you put the mail second

388
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,819
you know you never put the mail first it

389
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,078
always comes after the female but even

390
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,060
that isn't like

391
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,979
strictly adhered to that I see in

392
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:50,338
cannabis but I mean we're trying to

393
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,860
Institute some things to make it more um

394
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,899
easier to read or legible scientifically

395
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,339
legible for all of us

396
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,500
well yeah I mean when you have a

397
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,940
consistent set of terms that makes it

398
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,159
actually possible to communicate

399
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,800
effectively with other people yeah

400
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:08,338
exactly and not not having that I mean

401
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,620
that's how we got here right messy messy

402
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,779
state that we're in right now

403
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,639
um and while well what that's saying is

404
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,399
true it's technically not part of say

405
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,799
the mendelian science it's still very

406
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,078
important to designate in the discourse

407
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:25,500
of practitioners like in the community

408
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,000
of practitioners so yeah yeah cannabis

409
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,240
is so different than a lot of other

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,159
plants and because it's been kept out of

411
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,680
the science room for so long due to its

412
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,899
illegal classification a lot of us were

413
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,578
the ones trying to write this stuff and

414
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,259
understand it from a point of view of

415
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:42,239
people who are not Collegiate you know

416
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,459
but just trying to do the best we can

417
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,680
with what we had and

418
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:49,198
um it's interesting is that runs

419
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,599
headlong into science and trying to

420
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,000
adopt that in and seeing how seeing if

421
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,159
they even give a [ __ ] on anything we've

422
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
done which is not very likely

423
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,740
yeah

424
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,120
and it's not an uncommon thing you know

425
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,500
in other fields of practice there

426
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,879
especially ones that are not science

427
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,899
based

428
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,298
um

429
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,699
it's still very necessary to come up

430
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:12,139
with your own taxonomy instead of terms

431
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:16,620
for the reasons I mentioned earlier

432
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:19,259
a good example of an f1r would be when

433
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,759
we had the sour dub and we reversed the

434
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:22,859
Chisel to it

435
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:27,179
um Diesel and sourdough are not directly

436
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:29,639
related and uh yeah that's it made for

437
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,140
amazing progeny and we find that that

438
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,200
happens a lot

439
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,080
um Rascal OG Rascal made his career

440
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,179
making a lot of uh like reverse hybrids

441
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,579
reverse feminized hybrids like that some

442
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,798
of the best earliest reverse feminized

443
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:46,139
hybrids were his so yeah

444
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,240
um modern times you have cannarado doing

445
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,900
great stuff with that as well

446
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,660
yeah and um I would say that f1rs are

447
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,900
very common right yeah very very on the

448
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,940
market now yeah especially now

449
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,080
okay

450
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,120
um next one the BX or BC back cross

451
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,538
okay so we did touch on this last week

452
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,058
yes but yeah and it's essentially

453
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:13,798
um just taking

454
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:16,859
trying to think of how to word this best

455
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,918
uh I can do this one because I think if

456
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,418
you want it pretty well yeah so the goal

457
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,960
of a back cross

458
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:29,220
is you are trying to bring in one stable

459
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,558
trait into an already stable parent

460
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,179
uh that parent is called the recurrent

461
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,279
parent it's the one that you are back

462
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,280
Crossing to

463
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,960
um and you have the introgressive parent

464
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,460
which is the one that you're trying to

465
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,460
take that one trait from

466
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,380
that was really good

467
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:52,918
that was really good I'm impressed yeah

468
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,960
so an example of that cross one

469
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,120
would be something like uh let's see

470
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,480
what would be good bx1 to use as an

471
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,479
example

472
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:03,178
I don't want to keep using Blue Bonnets

473
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,340
so I'm going to switch it up and go to

474
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:09,179
like our strawberry cream strawberry

475
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:12,058
cream was a line developed by CBF work

476
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,460
several generations and was pretty close

477
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:16,200
to to breeding true especially with the

478
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,419
Clone we had even when we outcrossed it

479
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,819
strawberry was very dominant and that

480
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,038
was the trait we wanted to lock in

481
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,779
um we knew that we we happened to have

482
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,099
been growing Santa Cruz Blue Dream right

483
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:28,319
next to it and noticed that they were

484
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:31,199
very similar the Santa Cruz blue dream

485
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,639
was a female and at this point I wanted

486
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,720
to have a regular seed line of

487
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,220
strawberry cream and CBF had gone taken

488
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,700
a Hiatus and I didn't have any regular

489
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:45,120
seeds of it so we took a male Johnny

490
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,460
Blaze which was a blueberry Neville's

491
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,798
Haze which is similar to the blueberry

492
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,140
Super Silver Haze that was used for

493
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,480
Santa Cruz blue dream and we outcrossed

494
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,419
that and then brought it back to the

495
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,819
strawberry or that cross we brought back

496
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,580
to the strawberry cream clone and it

497
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:04,319
produce consistent strawberry Turks so

498
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:07,558
that would be an example of an effective

499
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,819
uh back cross one

500
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:10,558
nice

501
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:13,200
yeah

502
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,298
okay and the final

503
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,660
one that we wanted to touch on for this

504
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,940
uh warm-up was an in Cross are you

505
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,720
breathing between two different filial

506
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,960
Generations right yeah so it's it's not

507
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,079
dissimilar to a bat cross in many ways

508
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,120
um a bat cross is an example of an in

509
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,699
Cross however usually an in-cross is

510
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,019
referred to in cannabis specifically and

511
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,360
again this is one of those the the

512
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,960
nomenclature from Cannabis

513
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,459
um is referring to like taking uh an F4

514
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,440
and Crossing it back to the F2

515
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,419
Generation a selection from the F4

516
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,038
generation and uh let's say you have

517
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,980
traits you like that are showing up in

518
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,419
an F4 male but you had an F2 female that

519
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,919
you really liked

520
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,419
um that in that case you would use the

521
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,340
F4 male and the F2 and that would be

522
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,759
considered an in Cross

523
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:04,619
um an example of this uh we had DJ

524
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,298
shorts blueberry

525
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:07,678
um seed line and we had a selection from

526
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,319
it that was very blueberry but very

527
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,460
modern DJ shorts blueberry which to me

528
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,879
means

529
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:18,000
um like the the butthole turfs like the

530
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,059
nasty Terps with um slight Berry but

531
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,038
very beautiful to look at purple

532
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:25,019
um short squat indica

533
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,779
and

534
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:30,240
we cross that to the blue bonnet which

535
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:32,700
is in my opinion a hybrid of blueberry

536
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,400
but very very dominant for the blueberry

537
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,798
terms and so in doing this my goal was

538
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,019
to make one that looked like DJ's Modern

539
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,940
Line they had the smell of everything

540
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,759
everybody wants from blueberry and a

541
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,519
much stronger high and in order to do

542
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,658
that I did a what we called an in Cross

543
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,119
because that's the best way we could

544
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,460
Define it as since it was given to me as

545
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,379
a pure blueberry line even though my my

546
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,220
suspicions are that it's the Bonnet is

547
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,280
not

548
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,259
because it was given to me as that I

549
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,058
I have to consider it and cross because

550
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:04,079
I don't want to just like say that I

551
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,819
know something that someone else is

552
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,079
saying is incorrect but I don't have

553
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:08,939
proof

554
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:12,000
I think that's a really good example um

555
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:16,679
could I press you to generalize and tell

556
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,839
us like what are the overall benefits of

557
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,640
using this method

558
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,379
I mean the overall benefits are if

559
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,419
you're not seeing certain traits pop up

560
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,520
in the F2 let's say you run a population

561
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,538
of the F2 Generation you don't see

562
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,279
anything in the males from that

563
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:30,900
generation that you necessarily like but

564
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,119
you've already like you've already taken

565
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,880
things Generations out like in high and

566
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,678
lowest example or in his case he has his

567
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,740
Appalachia and he worked that to I think

568
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,200
F5 F6 and then didn't like necessarily

569
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,480
what he was seeing so he went back pop

570
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,220
more f2s and at this point if he doesn't

571
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,919
find anything in you know

572
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,659
in those F in that F2 realm that he

573
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,400
liked he could have popped some of the

574
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,260
F6 looked for mail in there showing the

575
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,900
traits that he liked and used that and

576
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,339
hoped that it bred like he liked

577
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,659
wow that's super interesting I don't

578
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:02,879
think I've actually

579
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,640
um thought about this that much this

580
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,480
this particular uh strategy very cool

581
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,480
yeah

582
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,460
um I think that brings us to the end of

583
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,840
this little intro section let's sort of

584
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,220
warm up

585
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,038
um was there anything else you wanted to

586
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,720
add uh on any of these met no I think

587
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,879
that's it I think that was a I just

588
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,880
wanted to give a quick jaunt with some

589
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,020
like examples hypotheticals maybe I

590
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,360
don't know

591
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:32,158
I think that I think was really good uh

592
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,619
all right and I think in the next

593
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,580
section we're gonna take it one step

594
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:41,099
further in terms of uh

595
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:44,939
uh examples and scenarios and we've got

596
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:47,519
a bunch of questions from the Discord

597
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:54,080
that's right um we are going to begin

598
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:54,079
with screwstone Scarecrow so he's got a

599
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,779
he's going to keep a triangle choke

600
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:00,240
individual

601
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:02,399
and um in his words it brought the best

602
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,798
trades from each of the parents had the

603
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,559
amount of high quality resin and a nice

604
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,779
high from the TK great blueberry flavor

605
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,519
from the Bonnet diesel bringing great

606
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,558
flower structure

607
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,700
um and also um augmenting the smell and

608
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:16,079
flavor

609
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,600
so

610
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,000
he doesn't want to use this keeper and

611
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,519
Crosses yet as he's scared to lose that

612
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,500
particular combination of traits and

613
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,779
what he's thinking about

614
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,240
is going through more packs to find

615
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:33,178
another similar individual to the keeper

616
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:37,259
that he's got and maybe doing a sibling

617
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:40,740
Cross or maybe an f2r now what do we

618
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:43,319
think about his proposed approach if his

619
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,620
goal is to produce more homogeneous

620
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:49,439
stock that represents his keeper

621
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,719
so there's a few steps to this that I

622
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,640
that I would ask him first and it would

623
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,140
be are you sure that this is the

624
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,140
ultimate expression from that line you

625
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,240
want to see like is it as extreme

626
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,640
blueberry is it as

627
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,079
potent is it as resonance as you want

628
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,020
and I've seen I've seen examples of this

629
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:11,759
and it's fun it's an amazing example so

630
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:14,759
in this case knowing what his example is

631
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,079
I'd say go ahead pop more seeds and look

632
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,058
and if you don't see something

633
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,819
immediately in there

634
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:24,298
um that you that you think can be cloned

635
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:28,019
and and you know grown more and then and

636
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:31,019
might compete or be better I would not

637
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:34,139
do any of those and I would probably not

638
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:37,200
cross it and I would uh I would probably

639
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,259
self it I mean if you wanted to have a

640
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,419
uniform homogenous line of that specific

641
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,220
expression

642
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:47,159
taking it through the generations

643
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,298
through regular seeds would be a little

644
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,980
bit trickier because you're going to

645
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,298
have to pick a male that lines up with a

646
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,759
lot of those traits or you're just going

647
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:55,980
to be constantly constantly like taking

648
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,538
a step back taking you know two steps

649
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,919
back one step forward two steps back one

650
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:00,419
steps forward

651
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,299
um it's very easy to have that happen

652
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,159
especially with a line that is a

653
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,619
polyhybrid like that so I really

654
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,960
recommend selfie for that example and

655
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,719
it'll take it more homogeneous quicker

656
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,819
in the direction he wants and you won't

657
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,819
have to pop as many

658
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,619
to really keep narrowing it down

659
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,619
yeah

660
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,619
yeah so

661
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:30,000
I was also wondering if he did make s1s

662
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,919
and okay let's say that he did pop out a

663
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,740
few more from these other packs that

664
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,299
he's got yeah and he did find another

665
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,038
similar individual

666
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:40,859
is there anything else you can do with

667
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,778
that to help this kind of homogenization

668
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,699
or is that just not ultimately going to

669
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:46,798
be helpful like could he self both and

670
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,840
then cross the S1 it's like

671
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,400
you know what what does that do so the

672
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,778
only way that I would recommend only the

673
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,019
reason I would recommend that is if he

674
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:59,339
found another one that say had such like

675
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:03,418
drastic potency but was equal

676
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:05,220
and smell and resin production to the

677
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:07,559
one that he was keeping but it was

678
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,659
drastically more potent but or maybe it

679
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,399
was slightly less smelly than the other

680
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,080
one but along the same lines and maybe

681
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,120
slightly less resonance but along the

682
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,038
same lines if they're close in that case

683
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,658
like I could understand crossing the two

684
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,879
to try to absorb one of the traits and

685
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,419
not wear out the other two but even that

686
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,419
still just

687
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,599
I mean you're still risking just opening

688
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,240
it up again right like yeah so I mean I

689
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,678
would still probably just S one the the

690
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,538
best of the two

691
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,100
you know or the best of a five or

692
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:38,519
however many of the keepers are very

693
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:40,859
similar or what have you

694
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:44,460
cool yeah

695
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:46,918
okay and he's got a follow-up and

696
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,778
this one is a bit broader

697
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,220
um he's asking

698
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,659
I think he's asking you in particular

699
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,700
because obviously you know the parents

700
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:57,299
and he's he's wondering like do you have

701
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,120
a sense of what would outcross well

702
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:02,460
um to his his triangle choke individual

703
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,439
I think so okay he does say something he

704
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,419
says

705
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,460
um yeah having experience with the

706
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:11,159
parents and having actually sampled it

707
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,380
uh they're types that might play well

708
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,380
with it I.E

709
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,778
um other plants that may not dominate

710
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,640
um but would still complement it well

711
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:22,500
yeah so

712
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,299
this is like a lot of the reason I was

713
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,919
doing some of the blueberry or the blue

714
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:28,200
bonnet like

715
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,038
um hybrid cross work like where I was

716
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,558
taking

717
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,599
um the the blue bonnet Skittles that we

718
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:35,940
had made and Crossing it to the the blue

719
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:36,658
map one that we made

720
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,179
um

721
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,980
Crossing The Punchy blister to the the

722
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,820
silver Pearl Blue Bonnet the cream that

723
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,860
we made

724
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:46,439
to try to see how those two cross

725
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,879
together and every single time it seems

726
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,140
to be moving forward the the blueberry

727
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,940
chirps very heavily except for in the um

728
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,679
in the silver pearl one the silver Pearl

729
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,880
tended to dominate mostly but the Bears

730
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,440
still moves forward like you can still

731
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,880
find them in there it's just not as

732
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,159
dominant as a silver

733
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,900
with that said like I really think like

734
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,480
the first thing that comes to my mind if

735
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,759
you don't have any males that you like

736
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,740
um they immediately show all the traits

737
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,839
like I said it's really hard to select

738
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,640
for and to know if you don't know the

739
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,359
line real well

740
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,520
um

741
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,379
things like the white bonnet

742
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,839
complement that real well because it'll

743
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,419
keep the resin production the potency

744
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,220
and the males from that I've already

745
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,899
found males that are dominant for the

746
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,259
the blueberry

747
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:33,538
scent expression and flavor so I know

748
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:35,640
that it can dominate the wife things

749
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,379
like that immediately come to mind but

750
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,179
again that's bringing in more genetics

751
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,919
it's bringing in more outside genetics

752
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,419
but if you're like if you're insisting

753
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,700
on having a regular seed line I would

754
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,320
either use the triangle choke mail and

755
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,640
really hope for it there or if you're

756
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,278
trying to drive in the blueberry chips

757
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,220
which I know he really wants to do I use

758
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,778
something like another Bonnet hybrid of

759
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,460
the same line like I said or something

760
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,440
like the white bonnet

761
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't think I knew you you had a wipe

762
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,519
on it just saying yeah I didn't really

763
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,940
sell them much I just passed him out

764
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,278
gotcha yeah

765
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,320
okay I think that is more or less

766
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:11,819
screwston's

767
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,139
question

768
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:16,019
um is there anything else you would

769
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:19,200
recommend or want to add to his

770
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,480
kind of set of parameters or

771
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,038
no I mean any other kind of like weird

772
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,899
Parts you could go down for fun or like

773
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:29,700
I mean you can always try the mail

774
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:31,079
selection like I said it's it's I

775
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,558
recommend everybody do it because that's

776
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,298
the way you learn the line try it yeah

777
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,918
um but other than that like selfing

778
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:39,179
because I know his goal and what he

779
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
wants to do it's hard to recommend him

780
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,019
to do anything else or because I know

781
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,200
exactly what he wants to get done with

782
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:47,339
it and it's a great cut like of of all

783
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,740
the um

784
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,839
the stuff people have sent me in

785
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,480
like that's one of the ones that made me

786
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:57,298
sleep like hardcore put me out it's

787
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,720
pretty good it's pretty good

788
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:03,119
very nice okay so I think we can move on

789
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,298
to our next question

790
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,699
and this one's from Kyle Terrell okay he

791
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:10,500
has a pack of banana tires once and

792
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,259
maybe before we go any further would you

793
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,778
like to tell us what the banana tire is

794
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:20,339
okay so the banana tie was a juicy fruit

795
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:22,259
tie that came from a local place and uh

796
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:24,119
when I picked it up it was a it was a

797
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:26,158
local club and I just thought there was

798
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,898
no way I thought there was no way that

799
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,080
these people would know what a tie was

800
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:33,479
or what Juicy Fruit tie was

801
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,519
um but it did look very quote unquote

802
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,579
sativa typically sativa so I took it

803
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,398
home and it was definitely a Thai

804
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:44,278
dominant plant that had been worked

805
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:47,699
um probably I my best guess would be

806
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:50,119
Scentsy seeds type Juicy Fruit Thai

807
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,679
um and it smelled like Juicy Fruit gum

808
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,719
it could be taken anywhere between 11 to

809
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,059
14 weeks depending on where where people

810
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,000
take it like where they like it but it

811
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:03,178
was explosively Speedy hide it is not

812
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,460
not play around happy Thai weed like I

813
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,440
assumed it would be it is very potent

814
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,298
and the banana tide was that cross to

815
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,460
our Platinum banana OG vx1 mail

816
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:18,058
very cool okay so continuing on with

817
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:21,179
Kyle's question he's got two keepers of

818
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:24,178
uh his banana tires once

819
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:27,240
um one keeper has a no ceiling High the

820
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:29,880
juicy fruit smell and taste but POI

821
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,519
structure yeah the second keeper has

822
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,620
better structure and yields uh tropical

823
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,119
fruit and banana chirps but a lower

824
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,699
ceiling for the hive which he doesn't

825
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,379
like yeah and so what he's hoping is to

826
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,538
bring the structure and yield from the

827
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,399
second one into the first one

828
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:45,778
and what he's thinking about so that's

829
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,759
the goal right and what he's thinking

830
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:50,880
about doing is reversing and then

831
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,220
combining the two keepers in both ways

832
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,278
and then maybe also selfing each of them

833
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,360
to look through that's yeah I mean

834
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:59,519
that's great

835
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,959
that's actually a really good example I

836
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,759
think of

837
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,519
of how to do that

838
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,379
how to how to lock in both traits and um

839
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,599
that Line's a hard one that Line's a

840
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,460
really tough one because it uses it

841
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,898
incorporates banana ogu and I've talked

842
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,480
about banana OG a little bit in the past

843
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:17,459
on the show but

844
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,380
in banana OG there are some beautifully

845
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,019
banana smelling stuff there's some

846
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,480
beautifully OG Kush smelling stuff

847
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:28,500
um there's combinations both and then

848
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:33,480
there's like this 60 percent ratio clip

849
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:35,819
of just blando skunk one just planned

850
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,558
land I mean it's it's got a decent high

851
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,778
but it's just so blanded it's not really

852
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,298
super appealing to anyone not super

853
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:43,919
resinous super Bland

854
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,339
um in the Juicy Fruit tie in the

855
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,200
outcrosses there is a lot of that too

856
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:50,759
there's low odor

857
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,880
um low terp

858
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,460
like just semi-sweet plants in there but

859
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,399
they're like that clone example just

860
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,079
ripping and it has a beautiful smell

861
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,839
so in that banana time I knew there

862
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,398
would be stuff that would be variant and

863
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,859
I knew it would have a like what we talk

864
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,960
about a high ceiling low floor as far as

865
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,598
what to expect not necessarily high but

866
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,099
what to expect from the the progeny

867
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,480
um so I ended up giving them away for

868
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,099
the most part

869
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,440
um but then the demand got pretty big so

870
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:23,159
we auctioned off a few after a few years

871
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,700
of it being out but in the s1s

872
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:29,280
um we use really good examples of it so

873
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:31,980
in the s1s

874
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,379
it should be easy enough to do like uh

875
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,760
sister crosses of the s1s and lock in

876
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:36,779
some traits that way I think it's a

877
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,760
great idea

878
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,419
yeah I guess it'll also be interesting

879
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,940
to see how easy it will be or not to to

880
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:47,279
reverse some of these as well absolutely

881
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,358
yeah because you just never know you

882
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,919
never know what's going to drop pollen

883
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:52,980
or not

884
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:56,279
I should point out by the way that uh we

885
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,599
did not uh manipulate people into using

886
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,220
Matt's work for any of these questions

887
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,559
that is just

888
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:02,879
yeah from this like we're all from the

889
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,858
small community and so you know people

890
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,039
are growing a lot of people growing mats

891
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:10,858
work and that's why it goes we're not

892
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,659
doing some kind of like uh underhanded

893
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,880
marketing although I think Matt will

894
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,799
still take it yeah I'll take it I mean

895
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,260
you know if you do a contest if people

896
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,680
want to but yeah

897
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:25,980
I feel like um organizing contests

898
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:28,139
online must be really difficult it's so

899
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,079
hard man it's just like even doing like

900
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:33,539
the small giveaway contests like on IG

901
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,579
we found that like there was almost no

902
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,440
way to do it without a second person

903
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,160
immediately complaining that they want

904
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,599
to

905
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,000
like we just never had it happen without

906
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,559
that happening it was crazy it was like

907
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,838
immediately we're in kindergarten we're

908
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,880
like ah I was first I was first it was

909
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,400
on my screen first you know so it's hard

910
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,858
it's like hurting cats you know

911
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,599
I think even like uh even more

912
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:57,179
complicated like the idea of like trying

913
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,099
to run like a little like mini cup you

914
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:01,379
know and like getting samples sent

915
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,300
around and just thinking about all the

916
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,338
different steps in the logistics and how

917
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,560
much could go wrong at every step and

918
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:09,900
like not being able to guarantee like

919
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,858
much really

920
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,000
um but I remember one of the Adam Dunn

921
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:18,420
cuts

922
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,480
one of my friends mailed in his example

923
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:24,420
and it got it got stuck at the post

924
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,980
office and we didn't know why we did not

925
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,139
have a clue why we just knew that we had

926
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,119
to go there and pick it up at the post

927
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:31,500
office and he had to present his ID to

928
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,300
do it and I remember looking at him like

929
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,858
are you gonna really go do this like as

930
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,839
we pulled up the post I was like is it

931
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,858
really worth it like we don't know why

932
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:39,119
they're keeping it it turned out they

933
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:42,358
were keeping it because it was like

934
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,099
short a dollar like I'm postage but like

935
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:45,299
it was one of those things were like do

936
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,859
you really think you're gonna give you a

937
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,060
[ __ ] lead back bro so yeah there's

938
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:50,039
all kinds of things that can go crazy

939
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:51,420
with those competitions just that alone

940
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,779
you know

941
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:57,180
yeah I can only imagine

942
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,579
I mean I would I wouldn't mind seeing

943
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,699
someone try but I I'm not gonna I don't

944
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,380
think I'm gonna get involved yeah yeah

945
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:05,578
it was wild

946
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,519
all right

947
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:11,640
well Okay so we've got another question

948
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:13,739
from scientists and um this one my

949
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:16,019
apologies I don't know I I hope I've

950
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,539
interpreted his question correctly there

951
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:20,460
are quite a few uh moving parts to his

952
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:24,539
one so I'll do my best

953
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,280
so his story is he was given some seeds

954
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:28,679
a few years ago

955
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,420
um a set of blueberry seats from one of

956
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:33,358
his friends

957
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,760
um and I believe he said it was from the

958
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,019
90s

959
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,079
um so

960
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:42,480
he's essentially wanting to extend his

961
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,380
buddy's blueberry work

962
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,940
um and see what kinds of traits exist in

963
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,039
this lineage that his friend has been

964
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,460
working with okay

965
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:56,779
um and part of the way that he wants to

966
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:00,780
learn about them is by Crossing them to

967
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,820
other other lines so

968
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,240
in addition to his friends 90s blueberry

969
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:09,300
suits of unknown relatively unknown

970
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:10,618
provenance he's got a bonnet F2 pack I

971
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,260
think according to what he's saying he

972
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,220
has two different pre-98 Barber Cuts

973
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,500
Maybe

974
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:17,519
and he's also got some peaberry

975
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,039
yeah

976
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,539
so what he's trying to do just to say

977
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,219
again he wants to try them out in

978
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:25,440
different combinations to learn more

979
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,000
about his buddy's blueberry that he was

980
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,820
given

981
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,420
um that's his initial question

982
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,420
okay

983
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,699
um

984
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:38,299
is that a question

985
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,039
I think so

986
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,079
uh like I think what he's trying to ask

987
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,320
is like

988
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,240
do these crosses make sense like so it's

989
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,160
on F2

990
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,759
yeah okay what can you what could he

991
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,679
possibly learn doing it actually so

992
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,440
um he listed a few different Bubba

993
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,960
clones right and that

994
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,099
and that's right listed that he was

995
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,380
growing

996
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,660
Bonita

997
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,420
Bonnet f2s then I think he said P Berry

998
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:10,920
which is the catsup loop on it and I

999
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,079
think he said the pre-90 above a blue

1000
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,039
bonnet which is the Bubba Kush

1001
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,780
and you can learn about all of those

1002
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,519
I mean if he knows Bubba really well

1003
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,440
those are excellent ways to figure out

1004
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:25,259
what's going on with his homies uh

1005
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,300
blueberry first if it's related to DJ's

1006
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,240
blueberry is a good question is it is it

1007
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,220
related to DJ's blue run it run it out

1008
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,139
um or run out a bunch of these these

1009
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:35,519
Blue Bonnet f2s see if anything's lining

1010
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,659
up at all see if there's any traits

1011
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:38,099
laying up

1012
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:40,078
um and if he knows Bubba really well

1013
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,960
like finding

1014
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,400
those bubble Blue Bonnets are so stable

1015
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,400
um

1016
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,680
um expression wise that like they're a

1017
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,780
great cross to outcross to anything to

1018
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,299
bring in potency and blueberry Terps I

1019
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,920
know um sub Rob from San Diego's finest

1020
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,599
Cuts is it's one of his more favorite

1021
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,700
lines is the blubber kush for that

1022
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,500
reason for male selection and breathing

1023
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:03,598
so

1024
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,880
yeah I know I think it's a good way to

1025
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,500
learn I mean like to to learn about it

1026
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,480
if he knows Bubba those lines will tell

1027
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,699
him more you know

1028
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,780
yeah and just to clarify as well I

1029
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:15,000
imagine

1030
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,339
uh just to leave like no stone unturned

1031
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,920
so to speak I imagine what he is going

1032
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:21,900
to do is actually first run all those

1033
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,220
things out separately right like yeah

1034
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,320
he's not just gonna like immediately

1035
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:26,399
cross them all yeah and then try to

1036
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,240
figure out what's going on because that

1037
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,940
would be pretty crazy yeah yeah

1038
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:37,500
so that's not the way uh the way is to

1039
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:39,720
run each of these uh packs lines uh cuts

1040
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,639
out look at them all separately and then

1041
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:43,980
maybe after that you can try like

1042
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:46,500
Crossing some of them and see what

1043
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,300
passes and like those lines are great if

1044
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,920
he knows Bubba

1045
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,180
yeah it's like it's really easy to pick

1046
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,420
out the Bubba traits from the blue

1047
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:57,239
bonnet ones to me but I know Bubba

1048
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,740
really really well so that's why

1049
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,779
you sorry you may have actually covered

1050
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:03,419
this but his follow-up was

1051
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,880
the peaberry help or would it just

1052
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,380
confuse things and slow slow things down

1053
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,180
his goal is not to make seed for

1054
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,059
production but just learn about

1055
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:13,980
that blueberry strain

1056
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,539
um so anything you want to say about the

1057
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,699
peaberry in particular the only

1058
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:21,119
difference between the peaberry and like

1059
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:23,219
the 398 Bubba from Shaw is

1060
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,059
that the peaberry I think that that

1061
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:29,759
katsu Bubba is a hybrid of Bubba so it

1062
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:31,980
is different than

1063
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,079
Bubble Kush traditional it's beautiful

1064
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,260
it's purple

1065
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,060
um but it is slightly different so I

1066
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,520
think that's I mean if you know the

1067
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:44,338
katsu Kai it's still very bubba-ish but

1068
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,739
it has different like the way the bud

1069
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:48,838
formations are is different typically

1070
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:50,098
than both then Bubba Kush but the Terps

1071
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:51,900
are very similar it goes from that

1072
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,200
coffee

1073
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,420
um chocolatey coffee to to the Soapy

1074
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,519
cushy depending on how you grow it

1075
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,720
I mean it's very similar I think both

1076
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,079
are really good

1077
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:06,000
um directions it it's so dominant bub is

1078
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,320
so dominant in katsu that you know a lot

1079
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,139
of people would argue whether it's a

1080
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,180
hybrid or not but I'm pretty sure it is

1081
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:13,139
okay

1082
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,078
um

1083
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:17,460
I've got he actually I didn't see this

1084
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,980
but he actually had another Point that's

1085
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,139
kind of a wrench uh to this plan in my

1086
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,079
opinion and maybe it was good that I

1087
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,879
skipped over it but now he's now I've

1088
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,220
noticed he said he's limited to six

1089
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,320
flowering plants per run

1090
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,399
yeah I sounded well I mean you could do

1091
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,260
it it's just going to take a long time

1092
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,358
be patient

1093
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,000
so how how do you approach that just

1094
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:41,519
kind of do it in parts right like yeah

1095
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,960
just yeah in parts and keep a lot of

1096
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,179
clones

1097
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,159
yeah yeah

1098
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:51,059
I mean I can relate I can relate buddy

1099
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,858
like yes it's not easy no it's not it

1100
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:54,239
just takes time

1101
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:56,338
yeah

1102
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,919
okay so anything else you want to add to

1103
00:42:56,338 --> 00:43:01,259
this whole Enterprise of like

1104
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,180
or do you think we've covered enough uh

1105
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,160
for scientists questions I just I just

1106
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,659
really like it because like um one of

1107
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:08,219
the initial things that I was running

1108
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:09,960
with the blah blah blue bonnets the

1109
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:12,719
white bonnets and a few others they're

1110
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,460
basically Afghani dominant Bluebonnet

1111
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,419
crosses

1112
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,159
um

1113
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,980
that was where I wanted to initially

1114
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:22,379
take a lot of the lines because itself

1115
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,800
bonded is very traditionally cushy

1116
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:28,680
Afghani dominant so it's a good it's a

1117
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,599
good partner for it essentially so yeah

1118
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:32,039
I like his idea

1119
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,980
I think the other thing I like about

1120
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:37,318
this question is that in some ways he's

1121
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,719
actually not really that concerned about

1122
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:42,239
making seeds or or

1123
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:43,980
um breeding per se in this one scenario

1124
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,199
he's actually just talking about wanting

1125
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,420
to learn as much as possible yeah which

1126
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:51,239
we did talk about last week as being

1127
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,880
extremely important and like

1128
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:56,338
it's also extremely time consuming and

1129
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,500
um resource intensive so it is admirable

1130
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:00,420
I think that somewhere it's like yeah

1131
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,699
I'm not I'm not actually about seed

1132
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,900
making right away I actually just want

1133
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:06,598
to learn

1134
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,280
um and that's quite rare there is there

1135
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,200
is one thing I'll add to this and it's

1136
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,760
just the the one thing from the past two

1137
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:14,039
shows that I've noticed in the comments

1138
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,060
that nobody like maybe they have maybe

1139
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:20,239
haven't communicated it well but the

1140
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:24,000
playing when I refer to playing which is

1141
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:26,219
crossing unknown to unknown or known to

1142
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,099
known and just seeing what happens while

1143
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:31,618
I say that's not breeding it isn't um it

1144
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:34,920
is an essential part yes so learning to

1145
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:37,318
breed it is you can't really breed if

1146
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,318
you don't know what you have like in my

1147
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:41,818
opinion and it is an essential step but

1148
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,338
it's not breeding proper because you're

1149
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:45,779
not doing necessarily having goals with

1150
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:48,299
selection you know it's like not gold

1151
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,920
there's not an end goal here we're just

1152
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,720
seeing what happens and learning but

1153
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,400
learning is a part of it you have to do

1154
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:55,139
that it's a major step so I don't want

1155
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,180
to Discount that part as part of

1156
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:58,379
breeding it's a major part of it but

1157
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:01,199
it's not

1158
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,318
reading proper if that makes any sense

1159
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,419
yeah I think I can I can paraphrase that

1160
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:11,279
um which is that

1161
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:12,900
um the sing what [ __ ] sticks Vibe is an

1162
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,480
important part of breeding but breeding

1163
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,400
itself is not reducible to that yes

1164
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,199
exactly yeah

1165
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,180
exactly and I want to make that clear

1166
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,799
because it sounds like like I'd see

1167
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:24,358
people's comments saying no it's

1168
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,800
important I'm like I never said it

1169
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:28,019
wasn't it's totally important I spent

1170
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,599
most of my career doing that you know

1171
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:33,599
like that's that's

1172
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,599
you know and I can't shoot on that

1173
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,338
yeah yeah I think um

1174
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,019
I think

1175
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:42,960
when people hear

1176
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:44,099
someone uh putting conditions around

1177
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,440
something

1178
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:47,760
um it does like uh some people can be

1179
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,679
quick to assume that that means that

1180
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,140
they just shouldn't do it but that's not

1181
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,358
that's often not the case often what all

1182
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:57,420
we're just saying always saying is we're

1183
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:59,299
pointing out the limits of something uh

1184
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,500
there is never just like something is

1185
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,300
outrightly good or outrightly bad or

1186
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,880
outrightly useful or outrightly not

1187
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,160
useful yeah each each thing each

1188
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,260
technique each strategy has its own

1189
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,539
trade-offs and limits

1190
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,240
yeah each strategy is good for looking

1191
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:17,880
at times

1192
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:20,759
female times there we go

1193
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,780
oh I we really need to get some not so

1194
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,780
yeah we do

1195
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:28,559
if any of you guys out there get bored

1196
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,960
and hear this and want to make little

1197
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,599
MP3 clippies of the best nazoisms I'll

1198
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,818
toss them up on the sound board for sure

1199
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,579
oh that's a really good idea Community

1200
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:39,838
please get on it and help with that I

1201
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,460
almost did some

1202
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,838
if I had like another couple of hours I

1203
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,240
might have tried to get some but yeah

1204
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:48,139
someone else please do it yeah there's a

1205
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:48,139
few I want to grab

1206
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,260
um we could also put his face on the

1207
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,500
screen what we're playing those oh yeah

1208
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,180
I could just make a not so mask and wear

1209
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,880
it

1210
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:04,440
that's terrifying yeah it is made for

1211
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,318
Halloween I'll make him one for me and

1212
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,780
I'll play each other

1213
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:10,980
we should do a Hello

1214
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,900
yeah we should

1215
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,358
that would be funny

1216
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,280
make him okay do imitations of me and me

1217
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,199
of him

1218
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,599
he has brutal I wonder if it's brutal

1219
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,098
imitations of me dude brutal I'm really

1220
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,740
I was actually gonna say I didn't think

1221
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,599
not so was like would would be down

1222
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:29,879
would is like the you know that he could

1223
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,119
do impersonations necessarily I don't

1224
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,519
know why but that's cool

1225
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,858
yeah I'm not saying they're accurate

1226
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,460
but it's more the things that he thinks

1227
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:42,779
I would say that are [ __ ]

1228
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,179
yeah

1229
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:48,359
it's worth it all right all right let's

1230
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:51,659
get back to the questions shall we yeah

1231
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:53,460
um okay we've got a pretty pretty good

1232
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:54,838
and open one from quasia he's actually

1233
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,318
got a couple but we'll start with this

1234
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,699
one so he these are hypotheticals I

1235
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,318
don't know if he

1236
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:02,759
I assume that he's thinking about this

1237
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:04,318
but he's not actually started on

1238
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,020
anything yet

1239
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,460
um he says so let's say he starts with a

1240
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:11,338
pack of Femme seats and he has a few

1241
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:15,420
possibilities here one is csi's Big Bad

1242
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:17,880
Wolf I think that is the chemd n91 is

1243
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,200
that okay if I'm not mistaken there's a

1244
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,380
TKS ones

1245
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,618
or he says one of the recent La Kush

1246
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:28,079
Headband hybrids okay so starting with

1247
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:30,720
one of these what steps would you take

1248
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,480
to get a male with as many traits from

1249
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,699
the Femme pack as possible

1250
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,380
and the follow-up being with the

1251
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:39,919
starting Femmes change the process and

1252
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,920
if so how

1253
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,960
um yes so they're all different from

1254
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:49,140
each other each step in that

1255
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,599
the chemd chem 91 would definitely be

1256
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:53,940
different from

1257
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:56,519
ATK S1 selection since they are variant

1258
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:59,159
dks ones its selection would definitely

1259
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:00,900
matter I mean some are creamy some are

1260
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:04,139
not like OG Kush at all

1261
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,240
some are very OG cush type you know

1262
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:10,019
um and what was the last one

1263
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:13,078
uh it was one of the recent La cush

1264
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:15,599
headband crosses from not so in CSI okay

1265
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,640
so mostly like diesel super skunk type

1266
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,260
hybrids we're in there most of them

1267
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:21,059
though some were like bubble gum and

1268
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,859
Bubba Kush or Mendo perps that were very

1269
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,960
different so it really does depend on

1270
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:26,699
what the starting material is before we

1271
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,318
can dive into the mails but let's assume

1272
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:30,419
let's assume he's

1273
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:32,759
um wanting to do

1274
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,980
diesel types

1275
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,839
or actually no let's go cam just because

1276
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,000
he went with Cam 91 cam D is the first

1277
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:42,119
one let's do that and assume he wants to

1278
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,159
go for chem uh types what where would he

1279
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:46,440
go for a male for that

1280
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:47,879
so you know it just depends on the area

1281
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,818
you're from and the stuff you have

1282
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,980
access to like I would immediately for

1283
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:55,500
any kind of regular chem

1284
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:59,219
breeding hybrid I would immediately

1285
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:04,800
think of uh mad Elite's work with the um

1286
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:06,118
like the chem 91 KMD I-95 specific it

1287
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,519
was just so

1288
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,800
heads and tails above any other regular

1289
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:12,599
chem work done by me done by anyone else

1290
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,818
that I've ever seen it was just so

1291
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:16,380
precise to chem 91 and I don't know how

1292
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:18,719
he did it

1293
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,000
um it was just really lucky and good not

1294
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:23,098
just lucky but it was he knows cams

1295
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,659
really well and some of it was luck but

1296
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:27,059
it was good selection you know what I

1297
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:29,219
mean like it had Legend OG in there it

1298
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:31,679
had star dog had triangle had all that

1299
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:33,419
stuff in the I-95 and then you add in

1300
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,039
chem 91 and chemd which are two

1301
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,318
different plants

1302
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,000
um but knowing that

1303
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:42,000
and knowing that it's very chem 91

1304
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,219
dominant I would definitely advise

1305
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,260
quasiya to probably track something down

1306
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:47,879
similar to that

1307
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,660
um it's

1308
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,818
tracking down chem stuff takes knowing

1309
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:55,920
really reliable sources of it and

1310
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:58,440
there's only a few people I trust on

1311
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,079
Earth with chem stuff to know what it is

1312
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,179
to know that they don't have fake cuts

1313
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,099
to know that they never got fake cutted

1314
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:07,139
any of that um there's only a few people

1315
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:08,579
that I trust for that and I don't want

1316
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:10,199
to throw people under the bus so I'm not

1317
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:13,440
going to name all of them but I really

1318
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:17,279
like Natalie stuff too

1319
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,619
nice nice and I think that that work of

1320
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,380
his is pretty pervasive now you still

1321
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:25,318
see it used quite a bit don't you yeah

1322
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:28,380
some people have it um we he never sold

1323
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:29,880
it ever you let people have it and if

1324
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,559
they were doing auctions for like

1325
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,300
Charities or whatever if there was

1326
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,119
homies doing auctions he would toss them

1327
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,760
in and he gave me a bunch to like sell

1328
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:42,240
and toss in for freebies

1329
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,819
um so they've made it out there but like

1330
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,318
not everybody picked him up so no that I

1331
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:48,300
mean people use them but they're not as

1332
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,699
pervasive as they once were I mean I

1333
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,880
know Dynasty uses it I use it and that's

1334
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:55,980
about it that I know of right now

1335
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,579
okay just for fun and for the sake of it

1336
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:01,199
would you would you be Keen to then now

1337
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:03,420
move to like say he's starting with the

1338
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,098
TKS once and think about what mail would

1339
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,858
work for that so a lot of wedding cake

1340
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:09,480
stuff pops up in that um TKS ones when I

1341
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:11,639
say wedding cake type stuff that means

1342
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,639
stuff that is like

1343
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:18,358
kind of creamy May Terps to me and just

1344
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,259
very resinous very productive very dense

1345
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:22,199
um

1346
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:25,200
you can find that in let's see

1347
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:27,598
what's a good one bodhi's um love

1348
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,939
triangle is a good example um you can

1349
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,500
like that that triangle ADHD 13 hash

1350
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,780
plant though a lot of people thought

1351
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,318
that the G13 cashback was too dominant

1352
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:40,140
in it for a uh triangle Kush type back

1353
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:43,079
cross it would be a great one I think

1354
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:44,219
and keep the um maybe hopefully help

1355
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,980
with the wedding I don't know if it'll

1356
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:48,659
help with the wedding cake terms but

1357
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:51,480
it might

1358
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:52,618
am I dude well you weren't joking when

1359
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,940
you said you could just do this off the

1360
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:56,280
top of your head eh

1361
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,619
um I I did it for so long on Instagram

1362
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,059
every night for hours

1363
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:04,940
you're doing free consultations with

1364
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:04,940
people yes free always always free yeah

1365
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:09,659
okay all right well how about now

1366
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:11,880
starting with the LA let's assume it's

1367
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,098
going to be a diesel type cross

1368
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,619
um you know what the sort of wrench in

1369
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:19,318
that Let's do let's not do a diesel type

1370
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:20,760
cross let's do

1371
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:22,199
um

1372
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,339
well how you know you know what yeah

1373
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,598
let's see a diesel type cross because

1374
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:26,039
that shit's going to be so dominant in

1375
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,420
there because it wouldn't make sense I

1376
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:30,599
was going to say let's do like Mendo

1377
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,858
perps or like bubble gum maybe but I

1378
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:34,019
don't think that's gonna necessarily

1379
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:35,940
dominate I think a lot of the bubble gum

1380
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:39,179
when it does it's just earthy and not

1381
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:40,380
pink I'm smelling so um diesel let's do

1382
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:43,618
diesel

1383
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,480
so again diesel is a hard one because

1384
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,940
there's still a few people I would trust

1385
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,318
to know diesels

1386
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,200
um

1387
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:55,259
for regular diesel lines

1388
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:57,539
God damn that's hard yeah I don't know

1389
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,920
if I can think of them easily I'm trying

1390
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:01,019
I'm trying to do stuff that's not blue

1391
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,338
bonnet related or blue bonnet adjacent

1392
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:04,318
and I'm trying to think of other people

1393
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:07,259
who make regular seed lines of diesel

1394
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:10,318
that I would highly recommend that I

1395
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:13,800
know for sure are using good diesels um

1396
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:16,318
I know chaco's um let some of his sour

1397
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,440
crosses out those are great

1398
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:18,440
um

1399
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,519
um

1400
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,019
I'm sure there's some it just really

1401
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:26,400
takes a lot of research and I don't want

1402
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:27,719
to throw anyone under the bus and then

1403
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,639
there's certain people I would recommend

1404
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:31,379
that just don't deserve it because

1405
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,159
they've been Pricks lately so I'm trying

1406
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,660
to think

1407
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,399
how about this how about this man make

1408
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:37,440
it be easier what if you didn't have to

1409
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,960
find another what if you couldn't let's

1410
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,960
just say you couldn't find a diesel mail

1411
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,179
or diesel type kind of regular line what

1412
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,260
other line would you go to if you could

1413
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:48,838
have

1414
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:51,059
um so I would recommend Super Skunk so

1415
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:54,119
look for like a diesel regular seed

1416
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:56,519
hybrid and now there are those out there

1417
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,318
um from other people besides myself and

1418
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:02,099
it's not too super rare to find just

1419
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:04,199
avoid anyone with 420 in their username

1420
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:06,240
because usually those people have fake

1421
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,578
diesel cuts

1422
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,078
yeah yeah yeah so just to be clear

1423
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,079
because Matt's being a bit um

1424
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:17,939
Matt has a bunch of like regular diesel

1425
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,859
crosses so yeah yeah and yeah other

1426
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,599
people do too but yeah there there's

1427
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,519
definitely out there

1428
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,680
okay and it's an excellent Super Skunk

1429
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,679
type and sauer's a super skunk and

1430
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,500
Diesel is more like

1431
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:33,480
um more like diesel than it is like a

1432
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,619
chem in my opinion

1433
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,579
yeah

1434
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:42,358
okay so within I guess within within

1435
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:44,579
this uh project like in terms of stiffs

1436
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:45,900
you know are there any particular kinds

1437
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:47,940
of steps you would recommend him taking

1438
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,380
or

1439
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,900
um you know since it's all regular

1440
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,119
reading I I really recommend

1441
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,318
um bat Crossing one time for the trait

1442
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,460
that he wants and then working it

1443
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:58,920
forward

1444
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,358
pick a trade start with the trait you

1445
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,740
know pick a trait

1446
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:03,358
um you can't have it all

1447
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:05,519
sometimes I mean I shouldn't say you

1448
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,539
can't have it all sometimes you get it

1449
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,579
all

1450
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:09,900
very rarely do you get it all but

1451
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:12,440
sometimes it's in managing your

1452
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,440
expectations

1453
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,500
because I mean that did throw me a bit

1454
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:17,159
when he said

1455
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,920
um

1456
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:22,318
what did he say he said uh with as many

1457
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,000
traits from the fempack as possible like

1458
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:25,440
that's an interesting qualifier for me

1459
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,579
where I'm like yeah that's interesting

1460
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,358
yeah

1461
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:32,280
yeah I mean sometimes you get good

1462
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:34,380
breeding work done in the pack that you

1463
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,240
receive right like the blue bonnet was

1464
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,539
red to go

1465
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:44,338
um CSI does great work so sometimes

1466
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:47,159
you'll get you know it'll be that easy

1467
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:49,380
um lots of times it's pick a trait and

1468
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:50,699
stick with one because that's that's the

1469
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:55,140
best you could hope for

1470
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:56,639
um but yeah but yeah it happens

1471
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:57,838
yeah so I think there's a difference

1472
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,719
between

1473
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:03,239
something unlikely occurring and you

1474
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,799
planning your process relative to what

1475
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:06,058
is likely to happen

1476
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,280
um and if you are planning your process

1477
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:10,440
likely to what is uh planning your

1478
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,800
process relative to what is likely then

1479
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,760
you should try to focus on like a single

1480
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,740
trade

1481
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,380
um at each step because

1482
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:21,899
you're you're reducing the odds I mean

1483
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,338
sorry you're you're helping your odds I

1484
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,380
think I was trying to make a point of

1485
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:27,659
that last week yeah I had a really

1486
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,818
really skewed understanding of breeding

1487
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:31,618
how it worked how traits work what a

1488
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:32,818
phenotype was all that coming up I

1489
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,760
didn't have anybody to teach me

1490
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:37,199
specifics on that I didn't really like I

1491
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,119
didn't go to college for this I didn't

1492
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,500
pay attention in high school to Botany I

1493
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,900
just didn't care like about any of that

1494
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:46,318
[ __ ] right so I had to learn as it went

1495
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:48,960
and it just none of that stuff comes

1496
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:51,800
common sense and that's the one thing

1497
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,838
we've been trying to drive home is like

1498
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:57,359
Murphy's Law plays out heavy sometimes

1499
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,880
you know expect the worst to happen and

1500
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,338
like I I ran into a lot of Murphy's Law

1501
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,500
on my way up that doesn't mean everybody

1502
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:07,139
does but I did so that's why I always

1503
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,818
like have these qualifiers of like you

1504
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:10,440
know this is the I try to give the worst

1505
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:14,219
case scenario what to expect because

1506
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:17,099
sometimes that's just how it plays out

1507
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:18,539
I mean I felt like in some ways and I

1508
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:20,760
know I'm being uncharitable about our

1509
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:22,619
content but in some ways I saw last

1510
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,099
week's episode as just an extended

1511
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:28,559
[ __ ] disclaimer you know in a way

1512
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:30,180
um I don't think that's inaccurate yeah

1513
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,040
because

1514
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:33,980
some of this kind of thinking is not

1515
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,719
intuitive as you're saying like people

1516
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:39,838
uh becoming accustomed to how you deal

1517
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:42,058
with probabilistic outcomes that may not

1518
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:44,159
be intuitive

1519
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:47,220
um using terms like

1520
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,920
low flow high ceiling those are terms

1521
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:52,139
that you use around probability and how

1522
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,099
you think about probability that's a

1523
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:54,779
good point

1524
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:57,298
and when you are dealing with

1525
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,220
probability uh probability it's not

1526
00:58:57,298 --> 00:59:02,400
enough to just say well it can happen

1527
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:03,419
it's like yes any of these outcomes are

1528
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,338
possible

1529
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,900
but it doesn't mean that they are

1530
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:08,759
probable so just because it happened for

1531
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,858
you once doesn't mean that it's

1532
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,420
repeatable and that it can be consistent

1533
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:15,779
you might just have been extremely

1534
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:17,940
extremely lucky like uh in the chat

1535
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,619
yesterday in Discord in the in the voice

1536
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:22,260
chat people were talking about their

1537
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:23,579
positive experiences with pollen

1538
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:27,299
chucking

1539
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:29,460
um like in the open like hitting Rand

1540
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:30,599
not hitting random branches you know I'm

1541
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,940
like hey I could do this it's nothing

1542
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:34,380
big you know I did it you know it's like

1543
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,838
just because you were able to do it in

1544
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,338
the tent with your you know that one

1545
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:40,380
time doesn't mean that you should like

1546
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:42,358
make that a habit

1547
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,920
because I promise it won't happen that

1548
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:45,779
way every time yeah

1549
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,920
I mean man you know we're chatting a bit

1550
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,839
about gaming which I don't think we've

1551
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,639
ever done before uh before we started

1552
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:52,440
recording and it it kind of comes to

1553
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:55,139
mind for me in in the

1554
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,440
in the world of games as well where you

1555
00:59:55,139 --> 01:00:00,960
might make a ridiculous move that works

1556
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:04,079
for you that one time yeah but if you do

1557
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,699
it a hundred times it might work like

1558
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,079
three or four times or you know

1559
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:07,858
something some kind of terrible success

1560
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,480
rate

1561
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:11,940
and there's a difference between

1562
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,740
something being reliable and repeatable

1563
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,358
and something that just worked for you

1564
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:18,598
just because it worked for you that one

1565
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,279
time exactly exactly yeah

1566
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:23,700
that's actually a really good way of

1567
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,440
saying it and uh illustrating

1568
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:27,239
you know like sometimes I play games and

1569
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,858
it's like playing with like actual kids

1570
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:30,959
and they annoy the [ __ ] out of me and

1571
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,219
and they do something stupid and like

1572
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,220
you shouldn't have done that but they're

1573
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:37,379
like but it worked right

1574
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:39,000
yeah but uh you know and then give up

1575
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,579
and then they walk outside and get hit

1576
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,019
by a car and then they're telling me to

1577
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:45,780
go touch grass or whatever I'm like yeah

1578
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:47,639
I'm old I know oh my God how do you deal

1579
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:50,780
with it how do you deal with them like

1580
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:53,639
cuss I cuss so much

1581
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,920
you don't have a full brain I'm gonna

1582
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:59,659
just forget about what you just said I

1583
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:03,059
just want to ignore you yeah okay okay

1584
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:04,500
so we can come back to quasia's second

1585
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,519
question which is also quite interesting

1586
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,539
okay

1587
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:10,019
um

1588
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:12,119
so his hypothetical scenario is finding

1589
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:14,460
a plant that has some really unique

1590
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:16,318
sense I think he specified like you know

1591
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,019
low concentration high impact scent

1592
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:21,239
compounds about essentially he's saying

1593
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:24,420
he's found if he finds something with a

1594
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:26,159
unique scent that he's I don't know if

1595
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,720
he's guessing is a recessive trait or if

1596
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,539
he's maybe discovered that it's

1597
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:31,798
recessive or has a uh premonition that

1598
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:33,838
it is

1599
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:37,259
um but that that scent is otherwise

1600
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:40,139
getting lost in the overall like nose of

1601
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,180
the of the plant right and also it

1602
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:44,639
doesn't translate to flavor

1603
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:46,858
how would he go about breeding to make

1604
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:48,539
that rare scent component more prominent

1605
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:51,179
in the overall nose

1606
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:53,099
and translate better to flavor

1607
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:54,960
he says it's fine to bring in other

1608
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:57,359
specific flavors as long as the overall

1609
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,818
package is high flavor and that the

1610
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:00,960
original recessive scent component the

1611
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:02,279
one that he was talking about at the

1612
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,139
beginning

1613
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,579
um comes through

1614
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:07,440
ultimately

1615
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:10,019
it seems like a

1616
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,760
I think nailing both of those things

1617
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:13,440
seems really hard maybe even just

1618
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,980
talking about how you try to get that

1619
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,200
one draw that one cent out is maybe

1620
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:22,500
enough for one part of this question

1621
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:25,139
so like for me the when he says like a

1622
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:28,260
high impact low

1623
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:30,179
occurrence or whatever low concentration

1624
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,859
concentration so like something like a

1625
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:33,419
volatile sulfur compound or something

1626
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:35,098
that's

1627
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,019
um dissipates pretty fast I would assume

1628
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:41,099
this way did you say Roadkill

1629
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:42,780
I'm just kidding yeah yes no no never

1630
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:44,400
um no guys I think that's what he's

1631
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,260
referring to

1632
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,059
um and it's probably the example I'll go

1633
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,619
to on how I tried to do it a few

1634
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:51,059
different ways

1635
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:52,500
um we had

1636
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:56,040
two what I think for Super Skunk

1637
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:57,539
adjacent lines in um like Diesel and

1638
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,880
then the heirloom Afghani which had a

1639
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:01,619
lot of um typically more sativa

1640
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,740
Expressions but

1641
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:06,539
it is mostly Afghani and structure and

1642
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:08,399
that's what we were told it was and it

1643
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:10,019
played out that way but what most people

1644
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,700
like it was more narrow Leaf in some

1645
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:13,920
Expressions so I think people would

1646
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:16,259
typically classify that as sativa but I

1647
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,180
don't see it as that but I do think it

1648
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:21,900
has super skunk in it or something like

1649
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:25,318
that or it's a similar type of Afghani

1650
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,420
um so I tried doing s1s of

1651
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:30,599
The Afghani

1652
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,980
and it had a very very high volatile

1653
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:34,980
self-compound

1654
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:37,260
um like you could just smell it like it

1655
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,539
was just wild wild strong

1656
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:41,400
in the outcross is what we saw or not

1657
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:44,159
I'm sorry in the self line what we saw

1658
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,579
there's a lot of variation uh we saw a

1659
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,899
lot of variation in

1660
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:50,940
expression being that it was it would go

1661
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,400
from because when you would smell it the

1662
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:55,318
the the combination of all those smells

1663
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,240
smelled kind of skunky but like

1664
01:03:55,318 --> 01:04:01,019
individually it would be a combination

1665
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:04,139
of like ammonia piss you know um burnt

1666
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:06,659
rubber tennis ball and then

1667
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:08,759
whatever that component is in diesel

1668
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:10,920
that is skunky whatever that component

1669
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,740
is that that you would describe is that

1670
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,139
in super skunk and jeseling in that kind

1671
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:17,279
of type or sour even

1672
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:19,139
um

1673
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,880
it had that but in those three

1674
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:25,440
combinations together it just smells

1675
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,420
loud like loud like burn your eyes skunk

1676
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,280
um but we saw like each of those

1677
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,619
individual Expressions laid out we'd see

1678
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,280
stuff that was just pissy we'd see stuff

1679
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:37,920
that was just uh burnt rubber when she

1680
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,140
stuff that was more like Savory skunk

1681
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,740
but it's really hard to nail the the

1682
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:45,420
trifecta of all three in a in a very

1683
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:47,219
potent form like the initial mom was

1684
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,720
super hard

1685
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:51,719
um so I tried that way and at the same

1686
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:54,838
time another location we were doing a

1687
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,818
diesel cross to a or sorry a sour dub

1688
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:59,699
cross to reverse chisel

1689
01:04:56,818 --> 01:05:01,739
and in doing this I was testing the

1690
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:03,239
super skunk the theory that like if we

1691
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:05,098
double up on the Super Skunk being that

1692
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:06,899
sourdough has super skunk in it by the

1693
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:07,980
sour and

1694
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,380
um

1695
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,480
uh so no Diesel and then diesel has

1696
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:16,079
super skunk in it probably being a super

1697
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,179
skunk self line uh accidental bag seed

1698
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,460
and what I found was that more

1699
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:21,118
consistently the skunk spray can seemed

1700
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,798
to

1701
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,740
and that was the name of the line

1702
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:27,960
um direct it towards the the sourdough

1703
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:31,318
uh diesel seemed to go more towards

1704
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:34,679
keeping it consistently in that super

1705
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:38,159
skunk Savory buttery skunk range

1706
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:40,618
and not veering away from it whereas the

1707
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:42,000
heirloom Afghani S1 would go the pissy

1708
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:44,880
range and more of the burnt tennis ball

1709
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,739
range if that makes sense so that's how

1710
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,720
I did it

1711
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:52,558
um in approaching that

1712
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:54,598
project in a similar method now moving

1713
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,760
Terps into it is is really hard

1714
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,200
initially like when I think of bringing

1715
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,940
in any kind of Terps to things like

1716
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:01,139
extracts I immediately think it's

1717
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,480
herphinoline

1718
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:05,338
because like that terminoline to me is

1719
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,159
turned up the volume on most fruity

1720
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:09,719
flavors Berry flavors stuff like that

1721
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,279
um I don't know that terpenolene

1722
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,519
terpenoline would necessarily be a great

1723
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,859
driver of skunky stuff but it definitely

1724
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:19,380
helped in the Fairfax four-way so

1725
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:22,920
there's no reason that it couldn't help

1726
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:25,260
with this and actually translate it to

1727
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:27,000
even more flavor

1728
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,440
um but trypanoline is known to dominate

1729
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,760
so heavy so you'd get a lot of stuff

1730
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,440
that was on later paneling with no

1731
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,799
volatile skunk compound or sulfur

1732
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,139
compound and uh it would take a large

1733
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:39,659
pop or a lot of luck to find but that

1734
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:42,779
that would be my first thought

1735
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:44,818
yep very nice and I think from a

1736
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,740
theoretical point of view like

1737
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:48,659
uh like he was saying it obviously

1738
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:51,179
depends a lot on whether or not

1739
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:52,920
uh in reality this is actually trying to

1740
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:56,098
combine

1741
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,500
um a few different traits

1742
01:06:56,099 --> 01:07:00,660
um or if it you know from say like a

1743
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:03,119
mendelian perspective it literally is a

1744
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:05,038
single trait that's recessive then

1745
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,660
technically again in from a theoretical

1746
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,520
point of view if it's a single trait

1747
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:10,798
that is recessive you need to find

1748
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:12,780
another plant that also has that trait

1749
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:14,639
that is and also recessive that's the

1750
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:17,640
only way you will see much of it the

1751
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:19,920
double recessive yeah yeah yeah so this

1752
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,879
is from the next like I think Matt did a

1753
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,559
better explanation of actually

1754
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,599
practically how you would try to

1755
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,760
approach it and that's and but by doing

1756
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,559
it and everything we've done and also

1757
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,319
okay a little bit the big bad wolf and

1758
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,000
other um other of these Cam and super

1759
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:36,659
skunk hybrids we're kind of figuring out

1760
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,420
yeah it seems like that that that smell

1761
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,980
in the Super Skunk lines seems to be a

1762
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,019
double or recessive it seems to be

1763
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:44,159
recessive and when you when you do the

1764
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:46,559
super what we call the super skunk

1765
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,298
double up technically is it it seems

1766
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,039
like it is a double recessive and

1767
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:53,159
locking it in that's why when you do it

1768
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:55,859
it consistently shows

1769
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:59,159
cool very nice I think that one will be

1770
01:07:55,858 --> 01:08:02,519
very interesting to a lot of people

1771
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:04,798
okay so um I actually had a last minute

1772
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:06,358
Edition I don't think I got to go over

1773
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,759
this one with you Matt but I think it's

1774
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:11,159
I think it's pretty reasonable

1775
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,920
um so it's from dougnus

1776
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:16,920
um he's got a male Sour Diesel unknown

1777
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,699
provenance so sour diesel quote unquote

1778
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:22,619
um he describes it as being uh

1779
01:08:19,698 --> 01:08:24,178
well-structured sturdy vigorous good

1780
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:26,939
gassy stem rub

1781
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:28,980
I'm assuming that he doesn't actually

1782
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:31,678
know he's he's not run progeny out from

1783
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:35,159
it before so just qualify that

1784
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:37,079
um he's doing stem rubs

1785
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:39,238
doesn't specify so maybe we can make

1786
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:40,318
some assumptions uh we're gonna assume

1787
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:42,119
no

1788
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,560
okay if you're doing stem rubs you don't

1789
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:46,439
even smell the flower

1790
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,779
yeah yeah you're probably right

1791
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:50,399
um so he's also got two female keepers

1792
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:53,819
of Limelight

1793
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:57,000
um that is Key Lime Pie

1794
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:58,920
um by mbbk sorry I'm not as familiar

1795
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,838
with this one

1796
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,940
um

1797
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,859
he says that they don't have the

1798
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:08,159
greatest frame but they grow well they

1799
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:09,779
smell good Pine skunk hint of lime and

1800
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:12,000
ultimately what he's trying to achieve

1801
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:14,279
he wants to put a studio frame on the

1802
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,579
Limelight and maybe add a bit more gas

1803
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:19,859
to the back end maybe maintaining or

1804
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:23,100
increasing potency he's made the first

1805
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:25,079
cross already okay so I was mistaken he

1806
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,520
has made a cross and he's about to run

1807
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:29,818
through the first generation to dig

1808
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,719
through to see what's being passed

1809
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:33,600
um

1810
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:36,000
the questions he's got if I find a male

1811
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,480
or female Keeper in the F1 pop

1812
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,179
should I go to F2 as well

1813
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:43,798
um or should I just try or what would be

1814
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:45,779
the best course to try and lock in those

1815
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:49,019
like

1816
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:49,620
um traits that he wants in the cross

1817
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,719
um

1818
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:53,939
so structure is one of the easiest

1819
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:56,100
things to breed for

1820
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,899
um true that's a good point because I

1821
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:01,699
mean hemp is very has great structure

1822
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:01,698
and that's like cannabis and it's

1823
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:09,539
you know like so that's true yeah

1824
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,040
um so and when he says it's Sour Diesel

1825
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,319
with great structure I immediately think

1826
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,760
that's not sour pencil because that's

1827
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:16,319
not and I think he's kind of aware of

1828
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,119
that I think he's saying that like you

1829
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,340
know that's why he's calling it but you

1830
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:22,380
know it's yeah yeah and that and that's

1831
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:23,880
typical though that's not even a crack

1832
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,520
on it because that's that happens a lot

1833
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:29,039
it's a male Are You Gonna Know

1834
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,780
um yeah so I I guess maybe his mail he

1835
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,640
wasn't able to get much more than stem

1836
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:34,139
rubs off of the smell which also can

1837
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,039
happen with males

1838
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,840
um

1839
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:39,600
if he's run through the progeny and he

1840
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:42,840
sees what he likes I mean uh

1841
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,340
S1 it there's no reason to F2 if you've

1842
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,619
already got everything you like with the

1843
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,060
structure and the progeny

1844
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:50,519
um unless you think it's not quite good

1845
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,719
enough and it's not cheaper enough for

1846
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,980
your case like if you think there's

1847
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:55,819
something better in there then of course

1848
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:55,819
you can have to do it

1849
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,079
oh good good

1850
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,880
I was going to say that his extended

1851
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:04,679
question was basically like

1852
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,840
I saw you may have already answered it

1853
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:08,940
he's basically saying yeah how far down

1854
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,159
the generation should I go and should I

1855
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:12,479
like consider back Crossing as well kind

1856
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:13,738
of thing

1857
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:15,539
um I mean

1858
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:16,979
like I said people have this want to

1859
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:19,380
like

1860
01:11:16,979 --> 01:11:21,178
work a line or think that they need to

1861
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,859
work a line but it if you've already

1862
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:24,960
found what you like there's really

1863
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:27,059
nothing else to do with S1 unless you

1864
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,840
really want a regular sheet line of it

1865
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,640
I think that's a huge point yeah

1866
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,840
you don't have to keep working it you

1867
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,280
don't have to

1868
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,840
you don't need to keep looking if you

1869
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:39,840
found like your ultimate keeper that you

1870
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:41,760
like like it Nails all the boxes you can

1871
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,739
always like I said explore look through

1872
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,880
the rest and be sure okay maybe there is

1873
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:48,539
something way better you didn't even

1874
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:50,880
know existed but um ultimately when you

1875
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:52,560
find that one that is a keeper well

1876
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,020
unless your goal is to have like just a

1877
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,739
bunch of regular seats backed up for it

1878
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,020
um

1879
01:11:55,738 --> 01:12:01,439
then I just don't know any reason

1880
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:03,780
to do anything other than S1 or self it

1881
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:07,079
so a paraphrase of this is

1882
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:08,519
work forward if you are looking for more

1883
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:10,920
yes

1884
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,480
but if you have what you are looking for

1885
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,000
then

1886
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:18,479
it is less less reasonable to do that

1887
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,619
yeah it's just why why

1888
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:21,658
yeah

1889
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:24,539
Yeah Yeah from a learning point of view

1890
01:12:21,658 --> 01:12:30,000
maybe but otherwise yeah why it's like

1891
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:31,500
when I see bx6 or bx12 or F12 like if

1892
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,760
you're doing real selections on this

1893
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,039
stuff you should be able to lock it in

1894
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,380
in four moves like at least the trait

1895
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:40,679
that you want or multiple trades if if

1896
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:43,260
we yeah people do bro people say crazy

1897
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:45,179
as [ __ ] dude like people be making seats

1898
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:48,500
for two years and say they're F12 and

1899
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:48,500
you're just looking at them like huh

1900
01:12:48,859 --> 01:12:54,658
dude I was watching um I was watching a

1901
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,820
BBC documentary on the history of apples

1902
01:12:54,658 --> 01:12:58,500
in Britain yeah

1903
01:12:56,819 --> 01:13:00,420
I'll say first of all it's [ __ ] most

1904
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,658
British thing I've ever seen like it

1905
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:05,158
sounds like it dude um it was it was

1906
01:13:03,658 --> 01:13:07,679
actually really cool

1907
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:09,238
um and they were talking about what it

1908
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,520
actually took to develop some of their

1909
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:13,259
new varieties and it was they literally

1910
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,900
were taking like a decade

1911
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,460
oh yeah because sometimes they're doing

1912
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:19,379
um they're they're waiting for sport

1913
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,840
mutations which is like a clonal

1914
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:25,380
mutation on a branch to pop up like

1915
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:28,560
that's that that's just waiting on luck

1916
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:31,319
and nature to take its course and time

1917
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,239
like it that doesn't it's a random

1918
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:36,359
occurrence you know like um my favorite

1919
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:38,339
apples are what they call them Cosmic

1920
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:40,859
crunch I think they're called and

1921
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:43,380
they're a um or Cosmic crisp I'm sorry

1922
01:13:40,859 --> 01:13:46,738
Cosmic crisp apples and they are a sport

1923
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:47,819
mutation off of the Honeycrisp apple and

1924
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:49,379
when I first got them I was like [ __ ]

1925
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:51,000
I'll just get the seeds out what the

1926
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,800
hell and then I was like thinking about

1927
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,020
I was like wait a minute I know that

1928
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,820
that's not quite how it works in apples

1929
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:59,040
it's not just fantasy do you know what I

1930
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:01,799
mean so I looked it up and yeah

1931
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:05,039
absolutely if you pop those seeds you

1932
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,539
may get nothing close yeah yeah it's a

1933
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:09,000
sport mutation so it's not going to

1934
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:11,340
occur at all like normally

1935
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,279
yeah they still rely very much on um on

1936
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:16,020
clones as well yeah grafting yeah and

1937
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:17,579
the actually I'll say this I think it's

1938
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,380
it was it kind of blew my mind this was

1939
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:21,779
the one part that wasn't

1940
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:23,640
um expecting at all they breed

1941
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:25,979
rootstocks

1942
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,960
like oh yeah they will they will have

1943
01:14:25,979 --> 01:14:30,178
separate kinds of root stocks and then

1944
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,520
grasp things onto them and I just didn't

1945
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:34,199
somehow I mean I knew this was a thing I

1946
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,420
know especially in Citrus

1947
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:38,939
it's a thing but I was just kind of

1948
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,920
Blown Away by the idea that like they

1949
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:43,559
basically have like a cloned rootstock

1950
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:46,380
that they will use so that brings the

1951
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,880
consistency I actually wonder if what

1952
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:51,060
that would mean in cannabis because I

1953
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,340
know glasses we do it people do it we do

1954
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,960
um oh yeah yeah like OG cushions have

1955
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,159
really really weak root structure who

1956
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,719
was doing this the other day I was

1957
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,460
talking to you someone I was talking to

1958
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:01,319
was doing this the other day

1959
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,119
um oh I know exactly who it was farmer

1960
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:05,639
Dan um but he's been working on it with

1961
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:07,019
some of their stock and um yeah OG's

1962
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,640
have really weak root structures and

1963
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:10,440
they're known for it if you graph that

1964
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,420
onto something like a Bubba that has

1965
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:14,658
like really that rich structure like any

1966
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,658
any

1967
01:15:20,179 --> 01:15:24,600
solid bro you can pound it out with some

1968
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,420
OG so yeah

1969
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,679
it reminded me of another like quite one

1970
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:31,920
of those like

1971
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:33,179
uh one of those weird like peripheral

1972
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,140
projects that you get to see on the

1973
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:36,060
forums

1974
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,940
um where it was like

1975
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:40,260
basically like rootstock with multiple

1976
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:42,859
graphs from multiple different

1977
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:47,159
individuals like onto the one mother

1978
01:15:42,859 --> 01:15:49,019
kind of like weird Hydra type plant they

1979
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:51,299
always have those emerald cut bro like

1980
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:53,340
the blue dream with OG on it and like

1981
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:55,920
[ __ ] like nine other clones grafting

1982
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,779
onto it it's like bizarre novelty plants

1983
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,300
I guess yeah like

1984
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:02,039
um kind of cool I guess I wanted to buy

1985
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:04,440
an Apple One Yesterday they have a three

1986
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:06,359
in one apple plant or tree that they

1987
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:08,579
were selling at Home Depot that I think

1988
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:10,198
I like I assume it was crafted

1989
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:12,119
I don't know how are they also they

1990
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:14,579
doing three in one no it must be yeah

1991
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:16,380
apple trees but yeah like but it was

1992
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:18,119
funny because like I see some of them

1993
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,619
that would like look smaller than the

1994
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:21,179
others and not be as branchy and they

1995
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:22,800
would they would be advertised as three

1996
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:24,658
in one but there would only be two tads

1997
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,100
showing that like so one of the branches

1998
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:28,799
got knocked off that was a whole other

1999
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,699
graph so it's really a two in one but

2000
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,800
they still wanted the same price

2001
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:33,658
obviously it's Home Depot

2002
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:38,640
I guess the going back to the the the

2003
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:42,359
kind of uh Hydra Hydra like multi multi

2004
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,340
Branch multi-individual graph thing I

2005
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:46,139
guess if you were like

2006
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:48,060
you live in a Prohibition country like

2007
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,900
me or under prohibition conditions and

2008
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:51,000
like

2009
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:52,979
maybe it would be a very ambitious kind

2010
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,198
of mother project where you technically

2011
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:57,419
would be had one mother plant but it's

2012
01:16:55,198 --> 01:17:00,779
actually many plants maybe absolutely

2013
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:03,000
absolutely I mean that's that's that's a

2014
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:04,679
that's a solution to a lot of people's

2015
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,859
problems I think

2016
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:10,319
um you can't keep many mothers keep a

2017
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:12,839
monster mom hide your mom monster Mom

2018
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:15,119
all right anyone in the Discord who's

2019
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,539
Keen please do it I want to see it

2020
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:21,420
um you know my friend Racer X who

2021
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:23,279
um used to be one of my like he's still

2022
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,440
around but like he was really integral

2023
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:29,899
in our company early on

2024
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:33,719
um he would do amazing like graph Branch

2025
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:36,238
like grafting like monster branches

2026
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:38,640
um it's like tree grafting branches and

2027
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:40,319
he would do like monster clones like six

2028
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,119
foot clones just to see if he could do

2029
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,219
it in like air pruning which is where

2030
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:46,380
you know you moisten part of the branch

2031
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:48,179
and like kind of little bit so Roots

2032
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,100
come out and they would like running

2033
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,920
grow into the soil on its own like he'd

2034
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,360
have these yeah

2035
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,039
he had great pictures of doing all this

2036
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:58,619
stuff back in the day but I haven't seen

2037
01:17:56,039 --> 01:18:00,899
it done in a while

2038
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:02,640
I mean I think I guess the broad

2039
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:04,799
I mean I know this was just like a fun

2040
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:08,119
tangent but I guess a broad a broad

2041
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:11,579
learning from this for me is like don't

2042
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:14,099
hesitate to look outside of cannabis

2043
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:16,920
for examples for information for

2044
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:19,320
inspiration because like I pointed out

2045
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:23,640
last week the information space in

2046
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:25,979
cannabis is basically like ruined and

2047
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,920
if you I mean apart from us of course

2048
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:31,079
we're perfect but yeah

2049
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,819
but uh otherwise if you want to learn

2050
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:34,260
about breeding definitely like look at

2051
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:36,000
other crops like you know human

2052
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,860
civilization has thousands of years of

2053
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,679
history of breeding so there's no reason

2054
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:43,920
why we can't learn from other uh types

2055
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:46,560
of agriculture absolutely and and but

2056
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,500
one thing I've also learned is um that

2057
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,159
like in scientific data specifically

2058
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:57,000
when they are trying to apply say hops

2059
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:59,579
or hemp to drug type cannabis they often

2060
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,319
do that and don't qualify that or people

2061
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:02,880
don't understand that it really is

2062
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:06,779
qualified as another

2063
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:09,659
type of this plant and um

2064
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:12,238
I mean it can work backwards too where

2065
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:14,579
like you overqualify it with cannabis

2066
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,799
where it doesn't necessarily apply but

2067
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:19,079
you should always look outside of

2068
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,400
cannabis always there's so many outside

2069
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:22,079
of the box things that you can bring

2070
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:24,658
from other agriculture into cannabis

2071
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:26,880
that will apply but do remember not

2072
01:19:24,658 --> 01:19:28,979
everything always applies

2073
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,140
um yes yes yes this would be a

2074
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:32,218
speculative thing not like uh you can

2075
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,140
definitely just bring in anything

2076
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:36,000
wholesale and assume it's the same yeah

2077
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,380
definitely I was reading a paper the

2078
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,479
other day and and this is something that

2079
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:41,699
I experienced myself in reversing like

2080
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:44,039
large populations of hemp

2081
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:45,599
um but they found that hemp reversed

2082
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:48,539
relatively well compared to drug type

2083
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,880
cannabis consistently so even though

2084
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:53,158
they are the same plant because one has

2085
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,039
elevated THC drug levels for whatever

2086
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:58,799
reason it is much harder to reverse than

2087
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:01,380
like the CBD like plants fascinating

2088
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,640
yeah

2089
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,800
okay

2090
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,239
okay well coming back I think this is

2091
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,179
the this is actually a follow-up to

2092
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:11,158
dudes question and it's probably the

2093
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:13,500
last question we'll get to for today

2094
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:14,759
that's good in terms of breeding

2095
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,500
scenarios we have a couple of like

2096
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,380
miscellaneous reading questions we'll

2097
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:21,359
also answer at the end okay so dudeness

2098
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,940
uh his follow-up

2099
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,920
I'd like to try to reverse the sour

2100
01:20:23,939 --> 01:20:28,259
diesel mail the quote unquote Sour

2101
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,140
Diesel mail to possibly get a nice

2102
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:33,480
female individual to pair with

2103
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:35,520
once self how many crosses of the

2104
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:38,539
progeny would be ideal to get a decent

2105
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,540
look into them

2106
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,640
um

2107
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:46,079
well first of all like what is the

2108
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,820
benefit of reversing the sour diesel

2109
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:49,679
mail like I I don't know much about this

2110
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:51,599
so maybe you can speak to that

2111
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,800
so in reversing males you use a

2112
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,239
different chemical than you would for

2113
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,039
reversing the females because we're not

2114
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:59,519
blocking ethylene we're trying to get it

2115
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:01,019
to you know have a lot of ethylene in it

2116
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,940
um

2117
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:04,440
when you reverse a male just like when

2118
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:07,319
you reverse a female

2119
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:10,439
you don't just get a perfect male

2120
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:14,340
version of a female you get a male parts

2121
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:18,000
on a female bud structure vice versa on

2122
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:20,520
a male you get email parts

2123
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,619
on a male bud structure

2124
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,580
and what you can make seeds with this

2125
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:28,380
not all seeds are viable done this way

2126
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:30,840
and also you're not getting a full male

2127
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:34,260
line either you're getting a regular

2128
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:36,179
seed line when you do male reverses so

2129
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,739
there's two things to understand there I

2130
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:39,960
mean if you want to understand what's in

2131
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:42,178
your mail I I it's definitely worth a

2132
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,460
shot definitely do it worth the shot to

2133
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:46,500
see what's in the genetics of this male

2134
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,779
you have you know if you think it's our

2135
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,219
reverse them and try to make the seeds

2136
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:52,079
see if they're viable give them a pop

2137
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:54,840
and see what's in the line

2138
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,238
um yeah it's doable it doesn't mean that

2139
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,440
it's going to be remotely easy or it's

2140
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:01,019
always going to be viable but it's

2141
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:03,779
definitely doable

2142
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:05,040
yeah yeah and I think the rest of the

2143
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:07,380
question is quite similar to the

2144
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:09,420
previous one which is like if he does do

2145
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,560
this

2146
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,719
um

2147
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,580
how far should he take

2148
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,719
working the progeny and I guess it just

2149
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:18,059
comes back to what we said earlier well

2150
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:19,260
it depends on what you find when what's

2151
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,300
your goal

2152
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:23,760
yeah and what your goal is

2153
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:26,039
um which yeah he didn't specify so I

2154
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,679
think maybe then our response is mostly

2155
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:31,039
about the male reversal and what yeah

2156
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:31,039
you know

2157
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:40,139
yeah gotcha gotcha is there anything

2158
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:42,658
else interesting to say about male

2159
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:44,280
reversals I mean most people do it not

2160
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:47,339
to make most people do it not to make

2161
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:49,500
seeds they do it to see what the terpene

2162
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:53,159
profile like to make the male produce

2163
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:55,198
more essential oils or Oils so it could

2164
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:57,479
so you can see what kind of traits maybe

2165
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:58,859
it might be passing you know like oh I

2166
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:00,899
can identify this is the mail trick

2167
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:02,819
because I smell that in the mail the

2168
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:04,559
resin glands on the mail that we did on

2169
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:06,059
the reverse mail I can smell that there

2170
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,440
and that wasn't in the female so I know

2171
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:09,840
that's coming from the male side or it's

2172
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:13,460
most likely coming from the male side

2173
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,460
um that helps in some scenarios

2174
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,060
um maybe okay I just I have my own

2175
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:19,019
question about this

2176
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:21,060
um

2177
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:23,640
let's say you you had you know your

2178
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:26,760
Bluebonnet male the you know now almost

2179
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:28,860
like mythical Bluebonnet male could you

2180
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,719
have so technically you could have

2181
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:32,158
reversed that on like you could have

2182
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,439
self that

2183
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,000
yes and we'll get out of that like would

2184
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:39,919
that have been

2185
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:43,738
probably something similar to

2186
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:46,739
a f

2187
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:49,019
if I know in the line it probably would

2188
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:52,019
have been something similar to what I'm

2189
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:53,520
seeing in the blue bonnet the X1 or the

2190
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:55,020
F2 is realistically because it's already

2191
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,480
so uniform

2192
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:59,400
so it it just really didn't really serve

2193
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:03,718
a purpose in that sense in that scenario

2194
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:05,158
cool nice okay that clarifies it for me

2195
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:05,939
okay

2196
01:24:05,158 --> 01:24:07,920
um

2197
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:11,819
so I think those are the scenarios that

2198
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:14,819
we have for this week okay I don't I I'm

2199
01:24:11,819 --> 01:24:16,979
not assuming sorry I'm I'm assuming that

2200
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:18,179
we will have more episodes if people

2201
01:24:16,979 --> 01:24:22,439
have more

2202
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:24,119
uh scenarios to suggest sure um so if

2203
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:26,399
people still do

2204
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:29,039
um please keep sending them to me in the

2205
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:31,738
on in the Discord uh on the in the

2206
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,840
content suggestions Channel

2207
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:35,579
um for future episodes I think yeah man

2208
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,560
I haven't really decided like how long

2209
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:39,658
this breeding series is going to be so

2210
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:42,800
yeah just playing it by ear

2211
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,799
playing it by rear

2212
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,340
thank you

2213
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:48,779
um okay so I guess we've covered all the

2214
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,460
breeding scenario suggestions we've got

2215
01:24:48,779 --> 01:24:52,979
Matt was there anything you want to add

2216
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:53,760
at this kind of like wrap up of this

2217
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:57,059
section

2218
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,920
no not yet I don't think so

2219
01:24:57,060 --> 01:25:01,380
they were pretty cool it was I think

2220
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:03,119
what I can say is that I can tell you

2221
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:04,739
that the vibe for this this week's

2222
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:06,658
episode is so different from our very

2223
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:08,519
academic Vibe last week and I'm already

2224
01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:11,039
enjoying it not that I didn't enjoy last

2225
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,300
week it's just very different yeah it

2226
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,179
was just more

2227
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:16,920
um I think more brain power involved in

2228
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:19,940
last week's for sure

2229
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:22,619
yeah for me it was this is more heavy

2230
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:24,539
it definitely was for me as well yeah

2231
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:27,420
and it's nice to kind of have that now

2232
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:30,179
as something we can reference and like

2233
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:31,920
point to but I'm also about it and that

2234
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:34,920
we yeah me too have done it

2235
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,359
I'm glad we did it too baby

2236
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,640
[Music]

2237
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:40,259
it's not over yet Matt I wonder if I

2238
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,699
wonder if M.C white out liked me

2239
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:46,500
Whispering that into his face right here

2240
01:25:43,698 --> 01:25:49,158
I love that mind cover that's why I do

2241
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,158
too isn't that awesome

2242
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:52,979
um

2243
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:56,039
okay so we can wrap up with a couple of

2244
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:57,899
quite interesting questions about like

2245
01:25:56,039 --> 01:25:59,519
they are about breeding but they're also

2246
01:25:57,899 --> 01:26:02,519
more about like the supporting

2247
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:05,340
infrastructure so McMuffin for example

2248
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:07,500
kind of wants to know like how different

2249
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:09,600
breeders stay organized

2250
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,279
I think he specifically had a mention of

2251
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,159
like notes whether there's like you know

2252
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:16,079
you've developed your own like shorthand

2253
01:26:13,158 --> 01:26:17,399
for things you know I know that you

2254
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,579
might have some stories from yourself

2255
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:22,319
and from like maybe CSI yeah how what

2256
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:25,559
what's organization like as like a

2257
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:28,439
commercial breeder so like me and CSI

2258
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,880
are the perfect like Polar Opposites on

2259
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:30,599
organization

2260
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:33,119
um

2261
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,560
and I I didn't really understand this I

2262
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:36,300
mean I've seen like you know people talk

2263
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,520
about taking notes and notations and

2264
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:39,719
stuff but I don't really understand how

2265
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,280
organized someone could be when it came

2266
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:43,859
to breeding until like he started

2267
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:46,259
showing me like his paperwork on like

2268
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:47,698
when he would go through and do testing

2269
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:49,739
on different things you know like I'd

2270
01:26:47,698 --> 01:26:52,379
watch it was just so detailed everything

2271
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:54,019
was so detailed and you know you know

2272
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:56,359
like has everything written down

2273
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:59,760
cataloged pictures

2274
01:26:56,359 --> 01:27:02,399
catalog like and when it came to me

2275
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,560
I am the opposite like I might organize

2276
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,319
my organization my life is just chaotic

2277
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,179
pure freaking chaos so I have never

2278
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:10,679
written anything down everything's been

2279
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:12,359
in my head and like I always kind of

2280
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:14,520
used the reasoning that like well if

2281
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:17,519
anything ever happens like I don't want

2282
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:20,159
to have anything out there to you know

2283
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:22,020
be incriminating or anything crazy but

2284
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:23,579
like in the end it really was just me

2285
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,739
being lazy because like I'm just not

2286
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:27,960
organized so I've tried doing it in my

2287
01:27:25,738 --> 01:27:30,238
head which it worked for a long long

2288
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:32,760
time until

2289
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:33,839
now when I'm getting older and like I'm

2290
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,639
not I don't want to say I'm getting

2291
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,400
older like you know like other people

2292
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:39,900
but like I'm further in my career and

2293
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:41,158
it's getting harder to remember a lot

2294
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:44,339
it's really getting hard to remember

2295
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,479
certain details and I see why he does

2296
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,279
what he does and I'm trying to

2297
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:49,678
incorporate it more in my life now too

2298
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:51,719
and uh this last round of The Punchy

2299
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:53,760
stuff it took better notes you know and

2300
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:56,039
and it was because of what I learned

2301
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,840
from him but yeah he's a he's definitely

2302
01:27:56,039 --> 01:28:00,119
a good Mentor to have when it comes to

2303
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,219
how to take notes and notations and he

2304
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:05,539
does have somewhat of a shorthand

2305
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:09,719
um it's usually by tag number by look

2306
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:11,880
smell taste I you know and it's detailed

2307
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:13,139
it's very detailed because you want to

2308
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,119
be able to reference all those fine

2309
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:16,920
nuances and then and anything that can

2310
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:18,719
be construed or bred with as a trait you

2311
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,100
want to write down

2312
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,840
um and that's not always readily

2313
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,100
apparent early on the the one thing that

2314
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,800
I did used to do when I was super

2315
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:28,380
interested in breeding purples is that I

2316
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,639
took notes on all the tags and I would

2317
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,859
always write down the color of the

2318
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:32,819
cavaliens or however you say it I don't

2319
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:35,039
know

2320
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:36,539
um I'd always take uh take notes on

2321
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:37,979
whether they were purple green to start

2322
01:28:36,539 --> 01:28:42,000
with to see if there was any correlation

2323
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:43,439
to that and flower and yeah that was the

2324
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,939
the first notes I'd ever taken on

2325
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:49,079
anything just because I was interested

2326
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:51,000
but I can continue that terribly long

2327
01:28:49,079 --> 01:28:53,158
too far in

2328
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,139
yeah I think

2329
01:28:53,158 --> 01:28:56,039
yeah for me it's like someone who comes

2330
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:58,679
from like you know information

2331
01:28:56,039 --> 01:29:00,779
technology and like and all that like

2332
01:28:58,679 --> 01:29:02,760
I'd be I'd have spreadsheets have

2333
01:29:00,779 --> 01:29:03,899
[ __ ] database I'd be like I'd be

2334
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,579
going hard

2335
01:29:03,899 --> 01:29:06,799
yeah man we can collaborate on something

2336
01:29:05,579 --> 01:29:09,300
yeah

2337
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,279
but yeah and now that you're growing to

2338
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:13,260
know me do you see why like my

2339
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,319
personality is like I have never kept

2340
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:19,139
[ __ ] I just don't like I'm so scrappled

2341
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:21,238
at that at the same time I I feel like

2342
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:23,819
for you to have the kind of recall that

2343
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:26,399
you do you must have

2344
01:29:23,819 --> 01:29:28,079
internally some some kind of like yeah

2345
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,039
internal structure that your brain is

2346
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:31,800
using

2347
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:34,439
to yeah and I'm curious know what how

2348
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:36,360
that might be so like I've tried to stop

2349
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:37,379
doing it but like on the live feeds I

2350
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:39,179
would do it a lot where I have to like

2351
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,619
when I think of something I'd close my

2352
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:42,300
eyes real quick and I go to my file

2353
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:45,179
system and my brain that I've tried like

2354
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:46,619
visually doing and accessing it that way

2355
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,899
but um

2356
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:50,279
yeah I got a lot of brain fog now so I

2357
01:29:48,899 --> 01:29:51,719
don't it's not as easy to do that

2358
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:53,359
anymore it used to be very visual

2359
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:55,800
everything was very Visual and crypto

2360
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,839
and now I can't really do that anymore

2361
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,300
there's a lot that isn't there

2362
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,920
yeah so you're doing some kind of like a

2363
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,940
little bit of that like Memory Palace

2364
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,158
type

2365
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:07,379
stuff you heard of that were you yeah

2366
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:09,299
yeah yeah I've never been able to do

2367
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,100
that I don't think but I think it's my

2368
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:13,500
form of that maybe

2369
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,880
yeah I think everyone has like some

2370
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,079
structure in their brains I see

2371
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,060
screenshots

2372
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:20,219
screenshots but they're not even visual

2373
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:22,020
screenshots they're just

2374
01:30:20,219 --> 01:30:24,000
I just think about it and it just places

2375
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:25,679
it's [ __ ] weird I don't know it's not

2376
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,840
even visual representations of anything

2377
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:29,158
it's just [ __ ] no maybe I just

2378
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,460
closed my eyes and pull it out my ass

2379
01:30:29,158 --> 01:30:34,738
I'm not sure but somehow it works

2380
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:37,920
it's interesting maybe I'll go and like

2381
01:30:34,738 --> 01:30:39,839
build some little thing for this for fun

2382
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,600
it'd be fun

2383
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:45,360
okay yeah I mean I can easily see like a

2384
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:47,520
a very very simple like Breeder's notes

2385
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:49,679
kind of tool which is not absolutely not

2386
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,480
far beyond like a spreadsheet but you

2387
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,158
know maybe made it it's not far beyond

2388
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:55,259
what you've done with the Codex to be

2389
01:30:53,158 --> 01:30:58,679
honest with you it's not either no it's

2390
01:30:55,260 --> 01:31:00,539
not yeah I could see like a

2391
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:02,699
I mean a lot of that would cross say

2392
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:04,319
this to you as well I did say this to

2393
01:31:02,698 --> 01:31:06,658
you as well that the Codex even though

2394
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:09,000
currently it was intended for historical

2395
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:11,339
plants and projects there's no reason

2396
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:15,179
why you can't use it to design projects

2397
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:16,500
either or track your actual projects so

2398
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:18,420
definitely something for us to think

2399
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:20,579
about for the future definitely

2400
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:23,940
that's cool okay

2401
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:25,500
so kind of related it's still to me

2402
01:31:23,939 --> 01:31:27,178
about like

2403
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,579
information

2404
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:31,199
and I it's it's one that many people

2405
01:31:29,579 --> 01:31:33,359
have asked like it's this one's from

2406
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:34,859
Humble FC in particular but my friend um

2407
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:36,198
Bud Goodman was also asking me about

2408
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:40,439
this which is

2409
01:31:36,198 --> 01:31:41,579
clarifying some of the terminology so I

2410
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:44,399
can just say this off the top of my head

2411
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:47,819
right you've got strains you've got

2412
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:51,238
strands you've got cultivars varieties

2413
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:52,619
you've got clones you've got individuals

2414
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:55,979
in general

2415
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:57,479
um yeah you've got phenotype

2416
01:31:55,979 --> 01:31:59,698
um you've got lines

2417
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:01,919
and okay I will say this I'm actually

2418
01:31:59,698 --> 01:32:03,839
not to me some of this stuff is still

2419
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,300
really blurry

2420
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:08,100
um some of it is not for example like I

2421
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,719
think I can immediately say that a

2422
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:12,300
phenotype does not designate an

2423
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:16,619
individual plant correct it is a

2424
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:17,400
particular expression of a single trait

2425
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:19,319
um

2426
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:21,299
that is what a phenotype is but yeah

2427
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:23,880
what about stuff like what is your

2428
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:26,760
understanding of like cultivar or

2429
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,800
variety or like so so I I've always

2430
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:31,380
understood like cultivar is a cultivated

2431
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,060
variety and that like the the simple

2432
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,560
definition is a plant variety that has

2433
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:36,300
been produced in cultivation by

2434
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,840
selective breeding

2435
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:42,360
so a lot of this to me is very hard to

2436
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:45,239
call a cultivar

2437
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:48,238
by the most stringent standards of the

2438
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:50,698
word and like I'm not handled that a lot

2439
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:52,500
but some like verbiage I'm super anal

2440
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:54,599
about so it's hard to call

2441
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,520
a lot of these things cultivars but some

2442
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,780
might be

2443
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:01,679
yeah

2444
01:32:57,779 --> 01:33:04,619
yeah but most like most cultivars are

2445
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:06,779
done with like root and stem cuttings

2446
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:09,420
um cell division

2447
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:13,380
um grafting

2448
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:18,859
like careful selective seed production

2449
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:18,859
and that's that's a very very specific

2450
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:25,439
qualifier for a cultivar

2451
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:27,239
specific selected carefully selected

2452
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:29,519
seed selection

2453
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:32,638
so yeah some things I think would

2454
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:34,860
qualify and others wouldn't on cultivar

2455
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,420
how about everyone's favorite strain

2456
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:38,219
right because I think we can immediately

2457
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:41,579
say for example

2458
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:43,800
chemdog 91 is not a strain is anything

2459
01:33:41,579 --> 01:33:45,840
actually a strain like in cannabis like

2460
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:48,060
I know okay from a technical point of

2461
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,679
view I know that like strains I use for

2462
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,699
like viruses

2463
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:54,359
yes

2464
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:55,859
um in a technical sense right but for in

2465
01:33:54,359 --> 01:33:58,380
cannabis land people use it as just like

2466
01:33:55,859 --> 01:34:01,738
a captural term for like anything that

2467
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:04,920
has a name almost whether that's like a

2468
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:07,738
like a cross or an actual individual

2469
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,480
keeper people will still just freely say

2470
01:34:07,738 --> 01:34:10,979
it that's a stream or like that's a

2471
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:12,178
strain or

2472
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:14,039
um

2473
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:16,020
I think so there's a few different

2474
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:17,219
definitions of strains out there right

2475
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,659
like most people in their foot

2476
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:20,698
restraints are referring to like

2477
01:34:18,658 --> 01:34:22,138
diseases viruses

2478
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:25,138
um or like

2479
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:28,679
strains of endomycorrhizae or bacteria

2480
01:34:25,139 --> 01:34:30,719
right but there is also a definition of

2481
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:34,500
a strain and it's

2482
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:36,359
and it's in connection with uh what is

2483
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:39,560
it like just

2484
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:39,559
I'm trying to think of the the word

2485
01:34:40,619 --> 01:34:46,920
a plant that has been modified through

2486
01:34:44,579 --> 01:34:50,340
selective breeding or through breeding

2487
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:53,039
not say selecting through breeding so

2488
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,139
yeah it applies in cannabis it actually

2489
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:57,119
does apply and is correct

2490
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:58,679
um while the strain seems to apply to

2491
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:02,219
most things because it doesn't

2492
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:04,319
necessarily specify careful super

2493
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:05,939
controlled selective breeding it just

2494
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,439
says done with Selective reading and

2495
01:35:05,939 --> 01:35:08,879
that can be many different things that

2496
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:10,799
can mean many different things to many

2497
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:14,520
different people so I think it more

2498
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:17,520
applies overall than cultivar does

2499
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,520
specifically

2500
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,560
until they're blue in the face on that

2501
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,300
but yeah that's my take on it I can say

2502
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,239
this from the point of view of like the

2503
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:29,820
English language at large and like it's

2504
01:35:27,238 --> 01:35:32,099
used in different practices and Fields

2505
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:34,259
just because one term is used in one

2506
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:35,880
field doesn't mean you can assume that

2507
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:38,159
that is the correct definition in every

2508
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:40,319
field yeah there are many fields that

2509
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:42,719
use the same terms in very different

2510
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:45,840
ways so just because you've heard the

2511
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,219
term strain in like virology or I don't

2512
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,239
know I'm not I don't actually know what

2513
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,679
those things are called but you know

2514
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:51,599
just because you've heard that term used

2515
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:53,639
in another technical context doesn't

2516
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,600
mean that that's the only meaning that

2517
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:56,340
it has

2518
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,920
correct um

2519
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:01,079
so I think that goes back to to what

2520
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:03,899
you're saying about strain okay in terms

2521
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:06,000
of like separating an individual plant

2522
01:36:03,899 --> 01:36:07,559
from a line you know what would you say

2523
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,420
about that like what do you mean

2524
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,440
sometimes you know in a cross you'd see

2525
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,520
like

2526
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:13,198
um

2527
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,540
uh

2528
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:17,939
uh this parent by that parent but like

2529
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:19,560
that's obviously an individual it

2530
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:21,419
doesn't Okay represent the entire line

2531
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:25,260
right like that kind of thing

2532
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:26,579
so when I say expression I it could be I

2533
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:29,719
use it very Loosely when I say

2534
01:36:26,579 --> 01:36:29,719
expression because it could be like

2535
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:34,679
a trade expression but I tend to use it

2536
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,420
for plants overall expression how it's

2537
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,699
expressing in that and by the reason I

2538
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:40,679
say that is because it's it's how its

2539
01:36:38,698 --> 01:36:42,238
overall expression is in that particular

2540
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:45,480
environment with that particular

2541
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:47,579
stringent set of variables so expression

2542
01:36:45,479 --> 01:36:49,799
works well with me like that's that's a

2543
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:53,158
that's a term that does work but a lot

2544
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:54,960
of people say that phenotype that's the

2545
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:57,719
phenotype from that line

2546
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:00,719
and phenotype is refer referring to a

2547
01:36:57,719 --> 01:37:03,239
specific trait expression not the

2548
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:07,260
overall plant the overall plant is not

2549
01:37:03,238 --> 01:37:11,039
the phenotype you can say the genotype

2550
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:14,400
is XYZ and that's relating to the genes

2551
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:16,019
behind the X the physical expression but

2552
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:18,899
the genotype isn't something you're

2553
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:21,600
necessarily visually seen it's something

2554
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:23,099
that no underlying genes no by

2555
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:26,760
definition it's not what you are

2556
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:28,860
observing by definition yeah yeah and I

2557
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:30,480
think the other term I've heard that I

2558
01:37:28,859 --> 01:37:33,719
think I use with when you're talking

2559
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:35,158
about the plants and just to use the

2560
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:37,800
term individuals

2561
01:37:35,158 --> 01:37:41,579
this is a that's great too bubbleberry

2562
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:44,520
V2 individual yep yeah and that applies

2563
01:37:41,579 --> 01:37:46,979
very well very very well um and and

2564
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:49,320
strand things like that you know

2565
01:37:46,979 --> 01:37:51,599
obviously that's not what it's called

2566
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:53,519
that people do it anyways um there's

2567
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,780
also like the other things I hear are

2568
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,420
Providence

2569
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:59,099
instead of provenance like there's a lot

2570
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:01,199
of terms that people have tried to move

2571
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:03,480
on in or use and adapt and don't quite

2572
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:05,339
fit but yeah those are the two big ones

2573
01:38:03,479 --> 01:38:08,158
Strand and Providence

2574
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:09,900
I I think that when you get strand out

2575
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:11,460
from strain I think in linguistics it's

2576
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:13,738
called like a it's a kind of slippage

2577
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,420
that's what they call it um if I'm not

2578
01:38:13,738 --> 01:38:17,459
mistaken

2579
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:21,000
um but yeah you know I don't know I

2580
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:23,639
think one one thing I'll say is that you

2581
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,020
have people on one end who think oh [ __ ]

2582
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:26,520
it does it just doesn't matter like as

2583
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:28,560
long as generally people know what I

2584
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:30,300
mean it's okay and you have people on

2585
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,460
the other end who are like almost like

2586
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:35,279
unwilling to communicate with you

2587
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:38,100
unless you have like locked everything

2588
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:40,380
down and we're never gonna get to that

2589
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:42,960
end either like it comes back to what

2590
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:45,960
you were saying Matt about like

2591
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,239
there's unfortunately unfortunately a

2592
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:50,639
bit of a blurry line between the

2593
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:52,859
established scientific terms and some of

2594
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,480
the terms that we consistently use as a

2595
01:38:52,859 --> 01:38:57,658
community of practitioners

2596
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:59,819
yeah and we unfortunately are going to

2597
01:38:57,658 --> 01:39:01,500
have to deal with some of that

2598
01:38:59,819 --> 01:39:05,039
ambiguity

2599
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:06,420
because language just isn't perfect and

2600
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:09,719
we definitely don't have perfect

2601
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:12,359
language for what we're doing yet

2602
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:15,239
um hopefully one day we will get closer

2603
01:39:12,359 --> 01:39:17,519
but I think so I just think that either

2604
01:39:15,238 --> 01:39:19,079
end of their spectrum is not for me like

2605
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,239
it doesn't really make sense either way

2606
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:22,679
like you can't just say anything goes

2607
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:24,479
and you can't say like we have to have

2608
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:25,980
it perfect before we can talk

2609
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:27,599
there's obviously some kind of Sweet

2610
01:39:25,979 --> 01:39:29,899
Spot between those two and that's where

2611
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,900
we are

2612
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:34,619
I think so as a language person I just

2613
01:39:32,819 --> 01:39:36,619
want to say that yeah

2614
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:36,619
yeah

2615
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:40,260
okay

2616
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,940
um those are the two questions

2617
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:45,119
miscellaneous questions I thought I

2618
01:39:41,939 --> 01:39:47,638
throw in there to wrap this episode up

2619
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:50,460
um maybe I did want to gesture towards

2620
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:51,480
some possible future episodes okay like

2621
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,920
I said we might just have another

2622
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:55,079
episode that's kind of similar to this

2623
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:56,940
so people have more

2624
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:58,439
um scenarios that are different enough

2625
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:00,539
from the ones we've covered today maybe

2626
01:39:58,439 --> 01:40:02,519
we'll do another episode

2627
01:40:00,539 --> 01:40:05,279
um there's a possible suggestion from

2628
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:08,699
quasia to do a separate episode on

2629
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:10,198
baselines oh yeah when when we say bass

2630
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:12,359
lines I think Matt has referred to that

2631
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:17,059
in the past as like the big names like

2632
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:17,059
Haze skunk uh what else is in there

2633
01:40:17,779 --> 01:40:21,920
there's Durban

2634
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,600
this there's a lot of there's a few

2635
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,179
overalls but like majority speaking

2636
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,760
skunk one or lytase are the big three

2637
01:40:27,179 --> 01:40:32,460
yeah so the kind of major precursors

2638
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:34,560
that um kind of like the Upstream

2639
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:37,260
parents uh the Upstream notes to a lot

2640
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:40,139
of the uh cannabis that we see today the

2641
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:42,360
majority of the night majority yeah

2642
01:40:40,139 --> 01:40:44,279
yeah and that could be cool uh for an

2643
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:46,439
episode oh yeah uh the the other

2644
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:48,920
exciting uh possibilities we may get

2645
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:51,799
high and Lonesome back for

2646
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:55,920
another episode because he did tell me

2647
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:57,600
that he would be quite Keen to speak on

2648
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,880
breeding for recessives

2649
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:03,000
and also to speak on his Appalachia

2650
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:05,279
projects which obviously you know is a

2651
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,260
is a big story and has you know many

2652
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:09,719
twists and turns so that would be very

2653
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:11,699
fun to do yeah

2654
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:13,679
so there's plenty plenty for for people

2655
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:14,698
to look forward to in the upcoming

2656
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,840
episodes

2657
01:41:14,698 --> 01:41:23,158
absolutely and um let's see we also have

2658
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:26,100
the uh C2 custom glass

2659
01:41:23,158 --> 01:41:28,439
just I I think tomorrow I get to see the

2660
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:30,960
Breeders syndicate versions of their

2661
01:41:28,439 --> 01:41:33,419
glass pieces for the first time so I'm

2662
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,219
super stoked man like I think that's one

2663
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:37,739
one thing like I've talked about it like

2664
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:40,319
you get leveled up every once in a while

2665
01:41:37,738 --> 01:41:42,479
um in certain things and like glass is

2666
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:44,158
not my forklate right and I didn't I

2667
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,500
don't I didn't really understand it

2668
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:48,960
being anything more than just a thing to

2669
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:50,340
get from point A to point a tool a tool

2670
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,198
right to get from point A to point B

2671
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:54,179
smoke to lungs but I didn't really

2672
01:41:52,198 --> 01:41:56,339
understand that like there are certain

2673
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:58,859
techniques that can be used in glass for

2674
01:41:56,340 --> 01:42:00,480
making things clear fast and like these

2675
01:41:58,859 --> 01:42:02,639
are overall so much better than any

2676
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:03,899
piece that I've ever had like the fact

2677
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,819
that we get to have like for your

2678
01:42:03,899 --> 01:42:08,698
Syndicate random ones blows my mind

2679
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:11,698
that's that's end game in-game caption

2680
01:42:08,698 --> 01:42:13,138
so Props to them I'm stoked to show them

2681
01:42:11,698 --> 01:42:15,479
um show them to everyone and make them

2682
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:18,779
available too to everyone which is rad

2683
01:42:15,479 --> 01:42:21,000
it's Epic so yeah I was joked about that

2684
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:23,059
I do want to add one more thing uh while

2685
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,738
we're doing this kind of like outro like

2686
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:27,600
I've been watching our stats and I'm

2687
01:42:25,738 --> 01:42:29,819
really really pleased to see that the

2688
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,560
engagement for the last few episodes has

2689
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:33,179
really gone up like we're getting the

2690
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,699
most comments that we've ever gotten

2691
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:37,859
really like Yeah in our recent episodes

2692
01:42:35,698 --> 01:42:39,178
you know I'm not counting like very very

2693
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:40,439
old videos that have been around for

2694
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:42,060
years

2695
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:43,979
um we're kidding like as almost as many

2696
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:46,500
comments as those in the pit in the

2697
01:42:43,979 --> 01:42:48,539
space of like a couple of weeks so yeah

2698
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:51,600
um I'm really stoked about that

2699
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:53,340
keep commenting keep keep interacting

2700
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,560
you know like I like engaging with

2701
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:57,060
people in the comments because it's fun

2702
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,500
like it just it just takes the episode

2703
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:01,080
further and learning further and I

2704
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:02,760
actually some of the comments like if

2705
01:43:01,079 --> 01:43:05,039
you go through there like you'll catch

2706
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,659
like old vets talking in there that'll

2707
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:08,399
say who they are and you'll realize oh

2708
01:43:06,658 --> 01:43:10,559
[ __ ] that's that person you know like

2709
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:12,839
people chime in that are really cool

2710
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,920
yeah it's also the place where like if

2711
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:15,300
you're not in the Discord because

2712
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,279
obviously people can use the Discord to

2713
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:18,539
do this but it's also the place where if

2714
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:19,800
you

2715
01:43:18,539 --> 01:43:21,600
um disagree with anything that we've

2716
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,159
said or you have more questions like

2717
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,619
definitely bring them up there because

2718
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:28,618
like I said last week we're not gonna

2719
01:43:25,618 --> 01:43:30,539
always be perfect and we're gonna make

2720
01:43:28,618 --> 01:43:32,579
mistakes we're gonna miss out on some

2721
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:34,698
things so he's gonna keep prompting us

2722
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:36,960
because I don't

2723
01:43:34,698 --> 01:43:38,158
keep prompting us because we can always

2724
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,380
follow up

2725
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:42,118
like actually I'll mention that like for

2726
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:44,100
example uh it wasn't in the comments but

2727
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:47,039
not so actually popped up in the chat

2728
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,960
last week to kind of clarify that

2729
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:51,238
applying can actually be true breeding

2730
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,880
just for a one trait

2731
01:43:51,238 --> 01:43:55,738
yeah um and that that's not the same as

2732
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:57,960
a plant being crew breeding for a whole

2733
01:43:55,738 --> 01:44:00,419
bunch of significant traits

2734
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,760
um and that's true that's true so you

2735
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:05,158
could have one trait that's uh your plan

2736
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:07,800
could be breeding you know homozygous

2737
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:09,719
dominant for one trait and that's

2738
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,520
technically a true breeding plant for

2739
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:13,618
that trait but you could also have a

2740
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,300
plant that's like you know homozygous

2741
01:44:13,618 --> 01:44:18,380
dominant for a whole bunch of them and

2742
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,380
then you have something that's

2743
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,900
more like a quote-unquote IBL right in

2744
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:26,820
that in that set of terms so yeah sorry

2745
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:28,559
random example of like

2746
01:44:26,819 --> 01:44:31,019
you know good little follow-ups here and

2747
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:34,440
there yeah it is

2748
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:37,320
