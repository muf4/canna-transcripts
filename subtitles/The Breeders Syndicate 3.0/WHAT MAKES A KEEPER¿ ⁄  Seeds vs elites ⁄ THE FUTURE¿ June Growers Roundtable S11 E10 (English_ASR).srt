something I didn't something I didn't

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:09,879
like but was I guess like market-wise

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:13,879
really good uh was the rainbow s S1 yeah

30
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:17,158
yeah um It produced like

31
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:19,798
crazy super pretty it had like just a

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,920
slight knuckle like structure to the

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,600
flower which is something that you know

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,680
the market seems to go for is the like

35
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,438
knuckly

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:34,320
buds um and it was po

37
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:38,478
as [ __ ] but the it the quality of the

38
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:41,478
smoke was just not so

39
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,239
good yeah yeah I mean and I mean it's

40
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,078
cookies based you know that's one of

41
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,438
those

42
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,239
things yeah

43
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:53,000
it's it looks like it I'll yeah yeah I

44
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:57,280
mean yeah there's no denying that yeah

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,359
but I I will say that if there

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,000
are there are bigger spots out here

47
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,959
guys who are just you know like running

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,080
you know buying you know U-Hauls worth

49
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:12,639
of oky cuts and like running them just

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,599
for the market out here yeah and you

51
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:19,238
know some of those dudes are getting it

52
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:21,280
to you know go so I would rather see

53
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:26,519
that in the market because at least it

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,519
works and it's something different yeah

55
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:33,080
definitely awesome okay well

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,560
maybe so the the next part of this chat

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,239
was meant to be about what you've found

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,400
but like I said earlier it's it's kind

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
of impossible to talk about what you've

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
grown without talking about what you

61
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,799
found so you guys already covered some

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,480
of that maybe what we can do instead for

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,879
this next part is actually talk about

64
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,878
one thing I mentioned earlier things you

65
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,518
didn't like uh that's one thing but also

66
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,840
maybe lessons you've learned and that

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,360
can that can that could relate to both

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,120
what you've grown but also like how

69
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,640
you've grown things if that Mak sense so

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,719
maybe have have a think about what

71
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,039
hasn't gone so well and what you've

72
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,080
learned uh from both the point of view

73
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,560
of the genetics and the point of view of

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
you're growing um Sean maybe we'll bring

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
it back to

76
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:26,000
you yeah um so things that I guess I did

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,759
not enjoy um

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,560
most um I grew out a bunch of dominion

79
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,679
stuff early like back in like 2018 2019

80
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
or so I didn't really find anything um

81
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,879
what I hear that accent what did you

82
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,840
just say what did you just say about VA

83
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:46,079
boy I didn't really enjoy much of it um

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,519
it just was just like a lot of just

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,640
citris you know like the the any like a

86
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,120
lot of the Screaming Eagle crosses and

87
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,919
um like the local skunks I I grew out

88
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,039
yeah some of those and it was just you

89
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:03,679
know Citrus and and not really like what

90
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,199
he said was on described as on the back

91
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,079
I mean um the only one that was like

92
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,598
kind

93
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,519
of um good

94
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:17,879
was the the one like the the the

95
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:20,720
crossroad chem um whatever it's called

96
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,560
um hudo yeah yeah there you go yeah

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,080
hoodoo that was the only one that was

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,759
like pretty decent um but all the other

99
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,680
ones you know was like they yielded well

100
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,319
but it was

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,680
just like a lot of citrus I mean I guess

102
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,240
the sangria punch the sangria punch was

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,400
actually good but that was it was like

104
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,680
Killer Queen

105
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:45,279
um Killer Queen Screaming Eagle so there

106
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,840
was like a fruit punch feno in there and

107
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,038
and that just tasted really well killer

108
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,719
Queen's dope bro it was a I think they

109
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:55,120
had the Lone Star cut of Killer Queen if

110
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,560
I remember correctly I believe so um and

111
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,800
that one that one was by far my favorite

112
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,918
of uh any of the ones anything I grew by

113
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,240
him and was like

114
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,680
um had like this fruit punch feno and

115
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,079
then they had one that was just like

116
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,439
Clementine tasting and stuff that I had

117
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,959
a friend that uh really loved and I gave

118
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,478
him kind of the rest of the seeds of the

119
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:21,079
pack and he popped those and and ran

120
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,199
that for a while he kept a cut um that

121
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,359
he really loved of just kind of like the

122
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,000
the Citrus

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,360
fenos um I preferred the the fruit punch

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,759
um it's like a really

125
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,919
nice um kind of more electric high but

126
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,280
yeah um and really long lasting um and

127
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,120
then I guess some of the other ones I

128
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,758
didn't really like the the LA lemon

129
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,360
tree

130
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:53,080
um I did grow out for the LA uh chds and

131
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,080
I just didn't really find anything I I

132
00:05:53,079 --> 00:06:01,758
was hoping for and I was growing them

133
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:04,758
alongside um the Blue Sour the appy f3s

134
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:09,639
um electric Baloo appy which I forgot to

135
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:13,360
mention earlier um which phenomenal but

136
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,560
um the the app f3s with just like the

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,560
the couple fenos I found that were like

138
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,759
this chem mango Funk that was just

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,959
really um mouth coding and everything

140
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,919
and the taste I

141
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,279
just you know was like I'd rather have

142
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,120
have this kind of thing because it's

143
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,758
like a a chem you know it's got the chem

144
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,360
taste and then the the diesel fenos were

145
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,360
all right but then three of the four

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,720
were just short Stout um of the LA chamd

147
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,720
and and you know I I may not have you

148
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,400
know if I if I ranom from clone and BR

149
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,319
random again I probably could have did

150
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,959
better with them but I also it wasn't I

151
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,120
didn't really find anything I was

152
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,478
looking for like the potency wasn't you

153
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,478
know the best thing you know the the

154
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:02,478
Blue Sour had better potency and some of

155
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,399
the fenos right CSI hear the appy the

156
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,439
appy

157
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:11,000
F the the appies were were were really

158
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,240
good too and and the the electric Baloo

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,399
appy it was just I they were the the

160
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,639
plants that were my least favorite of

161
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,000
what else was going um I'm not saying

162
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,598
like it was bad but just of everything

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,759
else that was going they're my least

164
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:30,478
favorite um and then what else

165
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,840
um other than that yeah I guess that's

166
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,560
kind of it's kind of about it I guess

167
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,918
that I haven't really liked I know

168
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,079
there's definitely some other ones in

169
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,560
there I just can't um think of it at at

170
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,639
the top of my mind yeah I was gonna say

171
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,598
as well um I realized that my question

172
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,000
is kind of a bit Batey in the sense that

173
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,839
you know maybe if if some of you are not

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,439
comfortable naming specific things that

175
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,758
you didn't like for various reasons you

176
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,839
can just maybe tell us in general what

177
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,319
you didn't like about it without nameing

178
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:09,038

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,278
commercial wise and everything is

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,360
probably good but like just the the what

198
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,240
I found it wasn't what I was hoping for

199
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,720
and and I was kind of you know told it

200

201
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,519

the most boring you know really like

205
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,800
bubblegum

206
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,680
tping no it was like I can't really

207
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,159
describe it the the best but it's got

208
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,078
like that bubble gum and then it goes to

209
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:27,480

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,399
5000 I had no idea they had grinder at

224
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:09,320
the North Pole where he's from anyways

225
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,320
um so I think where we at like uh uh

226
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,399
Kyle did you go over yours uh no but I

227
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,160
was just thinking of what I could uh

228
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,039
what I which ones I didn't like uh so

229
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,679
there was actually one which I was

230
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,759
really looking forward to was grape

231
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,439
chocolada which was grape pie and

232
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:30,000
chocolate Thai from canado oh yeah yeah

233
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,320
the ones that actually uh were kind of

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,759
okay I thought the the high was just if

235
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,879
they were all um it was almost like you

236
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,039
grew them too long the high was just

237
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,600
boring just Bland it was just like H

238
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,120
well you know you got stoned but that

239
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,000
was it it was almost like they you

240
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,200
overgrown you know you grew them too

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,639
long type of thing every single time um

242
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,920
and then lessons would definitely be the

243
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:57,159
Isaac Hayes and that's from dampering uh

244
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,599
because y samies yeah yeah yeah so I

245
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,719
yeah I grew those inside and I

246
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,519
definitely got some jungly type stuff

247
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,000
well and I also grow uh tents in a

248
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,679
garage so I kind of deal with outside

249
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,039
environment type stuff inside it's kind

250
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:13,239
of weird yeah so I know mean yeah so

251
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,679
during the summer when it gets in Cali

252
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,360
it gets hot so yeah it was they just

253
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,199
they didn't they never stopped and they

254
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,560
were in one gallons and I they without

255
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,920
with the bends they probably would have

256
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,479
been 12 feet uh they were they yeah

257
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,439
around the lights and two of them were

258
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,120
like that uh so that was definitely

259
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,680
interesting so I learned a lot there and

260
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,720
reset everything and uh haven't had that

261
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,319
problem other ones wer weren't finishing

262
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
as well and I think it was definitely

263
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,920
the heat uh because I run stuff hot

264
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,559
anyway with t uh so yeah I think that

265
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,199
was so definitely that was

266
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,119
lesson big lesson right there because I

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,839
mean for why I had to completely reset

268
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,440
and I remember even some some very nice

269
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,600
people hit me up on the DMS and like hey

270
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,040
man your stuff's not looking too too

271
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,680
good so yeah yeah that was pretty funny

272
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,679
so so shout out to skid willly and

273
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:09,399
Denali and then yeah I grew the same

274
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,799
banana thae I think that uh Sean did and

275
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,198
mine were remade Tangi so that wasn't

276
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,639
the greatest thing I end yeah I end up

277
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:20,000
throwing them the jars out actually

278
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,560
that'll do it they were they weren't uh

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,440
yeah I don't like Tangi Citrus is

280
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,439
definitely not my thing so yeah know

281
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,240
yeah so I will actually I think part of

282
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,600
that other uh the part of the banana tie

283
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,399
it actually is more of the Citrus part

284
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
and I think that's what I got but yeah

285
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,320
it was really weird it was just Tangy

286
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,959
yeah it was pretty bad so yeah I'm not a

287
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,839
Ki fan either yeah and then uh yeah man

288
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:46,559
that's about it for I can't really think

289
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,800
of too many you know because I just I

290
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,838
most of them when I grow I know uh I do

291
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,278
random stuff so a lot of stuff sometimes

292
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,839
I'm not really looking I'm just looking

293
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:56,559
to learn uh stuff type of thing

294
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,639
especially since I'm newer uh I just

295
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,759
want to see uh stuff so I do

296
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,839
S1 especially just to get a look under

297
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,559
the hood type thing yeah no it's a great

298
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,600
way to do it it gives you a lot of

299
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,159
really good especially s1's from from a

300
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,159
reliable source it gives you uh data

301
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,559
points you can you can speak on things

302
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:17,838
more thoroughly you can you get a much

303
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:21,399
better understanding of traits uh you

304
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,000
know there's a lot to it yeah so yeah

305
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,399
and that's probably it for lessons and

306
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,360
uh stuff I didn't like that I can think

307
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,639
of right off the bat so all right so

308
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,079
from here we're going going to move on

309
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,480
to what else you're looking

310
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:38,759
for the

311
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,839
future um Sean desired strains and

312
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,600
traits uh what we're gonna have you guys

313
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,519
do you know one after the other each

314
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,040
grower shares which strains they are

315
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,399
interested in growing out next and then

316
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,559
uh discuss specific traits you're

317
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:59,519
looking for etc etc

318
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:01,278
etc so um I know I think later on we

319
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,720
we're going to talk about like things

320
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,879
we're growing next or whatever but um

321
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,920
some of the things I am excited about

322
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,639
and and want to try and look for like

323
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:18,039
certain traits um so sleep disturbance

324
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:21,480

um green so good ones in there yeah the

350
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,800
electric boo and I just you know kind of

351
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,719
want to see both parents in there get um

352
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,399
because I haven't really grown any true

353
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,360
hazes so get some experience of that um

354
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,519
see things and and also just you know

355
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,519
try and find some really nice electric

356
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:47,039
uh work weed um which would be nice and

357
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,240
then also um I have some

358
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:53,198
of uh Lu's uh saene 16 Destroyer that I

359
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,278
really want to look through and just

360
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,359
find some just really something really

361
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,759
unique um like tpping profile and and

362
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,199
and high wise um just something that you

363
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,519
know may be a little bit trippy um and

364
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,519
and just the description that I've heard

365
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:11,198
of the sir 16 being kind of like a

366
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,679
blueberry OG that just sounds wonderful

367
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:18,958
too so like blueberry muffin cereal like

368
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:21,638
so [ __ ] good it's really yeah no

369
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,399
blueberry in it hoping to find something

370
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,240
with like that kind of tpine profile

371
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,278
with the the Destroyer effects um I'm

372
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,120
sure the saan effect uh 6 scene effects

373
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:38,679
are really great as well

374
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:41,159
um and then also his um Malibu P Kush uh

375
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:44,278
A5 backcross yeah I want to check those

376
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,600
out as well um and just you know grow

377
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:49,519
some more uh hay stuff stuff that's like

378
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,959
more unique um not really what other

379
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,039
people are necessarily growing I know a

380
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,000
bunch of people are about to start going

381
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,120
into H lonesome's man

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,559
Hayes but that's fine I mean everyone

383
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,318
should that there's going to be a bunch

384
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,198
of really cool stuff in there

385
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:06,918
um and you know that's what I would kind

386
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,959
of go to First just you know if you have

387
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:13,240
the space and and time and everything um

388
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,199
just no unique versus like you can go

389
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,400
and get chems and and everything else o

390
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,160
not necessarily ogs as much anymore you

391
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,600
can find some OG hybrids here and there

392
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,720
um but like everyone's growing cookies

393
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,879
and chem stuff and sour this and sour

394
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,798
that and so so like you know I'm trying

395
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,799
to like not keep growing that I grew out

396
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,558
a lot of sour hybrids I'm just and and

397
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,918
Diesel hybrids in general and I'm just

398
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,359
kind of sick of those like it's massive

399
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,880
Hit or Miss in those um dude it is it

400
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:48,719
really is wasted so much time um I feel

401
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:53,360
like no yeah just to find the final

402
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,159
three I ran of of the the sour skunk dog

403
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,678
the Blue Sour and the appy Diesel and

404
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,159
then finally found those and I'm just

405
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,440
like all right like those those are the

406
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,440
only ones I'm going to go back through

407
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:07,759
and look through if um when I do um but

408
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
yeah just wasting time trying to like

409
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,119
Chase certain things um that I felt

410
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,038
worth were worth chasing at the time and

411
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,000
you know it it is what it is you you

412
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,759
know you you live and learn um so I'm

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,599
just trying to grow some more unique

414
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,640
stuff um get some you know experience

415
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,798
growing more longer flowering stuff see

416
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,480
different

417
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,918
structures um and just learned different

418
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,519
techniques from seeing these structures

419
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,280
on how to apply to make them work for um

420
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,319
my space and and everything um I just

421
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,240
you know kind of love experimenting and

422
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,759
just plants in general I I work with

423
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,400
plants so just seeing how everything

424
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:49,879
grows and its growth structures um the

425
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:53,038
different smells it produces um it's uh

426
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,120
like just the strength some of the the

427
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,038
branches can get to and I you know I

428
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,319
enjoyed training at times so it'll be

429
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:00,960
fun with the haze and everything when

430
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,678
they start stretching to to see what I

431
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,319
can do with them I you know I'm just

432
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,880
trying to see as many things as possible

433
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,839
um and I try and run plants that have

434
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,799
the same parents at the same time so if

435
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,119
it is going to put out the father like

436
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,158
there's either going to be like a bunch

437
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:21,079
of plants that are all the same fathers

438
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,159
um and then just so I can you know

439
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,000
notice those traits easier where I could

440
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,320
be like well that line has this and then

441
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,359
that line also has this the same father

442
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,359
chance art could be the father um and

443
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,918
just kind of just narrow down and just

444
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,158
learn little different traits and and

445
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,559
little like nuances of of each little

446
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,200
plant yeah dude it's it's a great way to

447
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,399
do it it's a really great way to do it

448
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,240
to understand a line and the the haze

449
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
lines like you know people always say

450
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
like I'm gonna grow this Haze I'm gonna

451
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,158
grow this piff you know like all that

452
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,280
stuff but really that mango Haze line

453
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,919
one of the best that Neville's Haze to

454
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,720
me and and trying to find a good

455
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:02,320
Neville's Haze now is very hard um mango

456
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:06,679
Haze Neville's Haze are the cream of the

457
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:09,960
crop for hazes that are like

458
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,400
commercially viable in the sense that

459
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,200
most people in generally speaking most

460
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,519
people that are into weed will smoke

461
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,159
them and like them like they're not so

462
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:22,240
Airy and fluffy again generally speaking

463
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,919
because they're in there that they're

464
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,679
they're going to look weird in a bag any

465
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,520
of that stuff like that that they're

466
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,519
awesome they're awesome

467
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,240
yeah so I think uh that's probably about

468
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,519
it of of what I'm looking um forward to

469
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,120
and just kind of what I'm exactly

470
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,798
looking for it's it's more you know like

471
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,879
trying to see different traits and

472
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,558
certain um things and just gain

473
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,600
experience and also you know find some

474
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:53,319
kind of unique racy High that's um will

475
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:55,759
also be good for you know aches and

476
00:20:53,319 --> 00:21:00,000
pains but uh won't make me too stupid to

477
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:03,879
work but we'll keep me alert

478
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,880
all right uh screw what you

479
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:13,520
got um yeah right now I have uh at week

480
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,480
four I have the skylines from H&amp;L okay

481
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:21,839
and that's what's in that the shoreline

482
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:25,679
by Appalachia sweet sweet and um and

483
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,599
then I just flipped some of the uh

484
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,600
garbage clouds from pack the um

485
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,240
Shoreline by Santa Cruz Blue Dream It's

486
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,599
a good way to see the shoreline stuff

487
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,000
see what it's like yeah well I mean yeah

488
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,399
that was your thing right like

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,440
shine yeah I kind

490
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,240
of I was a little bit uh uh annoying

491
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,400
about it but no I mean no like that was

492
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,720
your Chase though that's like your thing

493
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,600
yeah I mean I've been that was like the

494
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,240
weed that you know the it wasn't the

495
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:01,719
first really good weed that I had yeah

496
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,640
but it was the first really goodwi that

497
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:10,519
I had that made me stop buying Swag yeah

498
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,360
you know it was like oh [ __ ] I I'll just

499
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:17,440
spend 20 bucks you know yeah

500
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:21,278
um so and i' I've been like trying to

501
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,840
get a hold of a cut and uh you know just

502
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:27,038
been a total [ __ ] Noob about it for a

503
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,079
long time and finally I did end up

504
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,558
getting it yeah

505
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:36,798
um and God damn is it hard to [ __ ]

506
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:39,399
like hit right yeah yeah that's a Wy cut

507
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,359
bro like just looking at it it looks

508
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,278
[ __ ] yeah it looks like it'd be very

509
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:48,199
hard to to grow consistently to nail

510
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:50,200
every time um yeah yeah and and there's

511
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,640
also you know like not only is it hard

512
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,278
but like the flavor I don't know it's

513
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,320
weird it's like the better you grow the

514
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:00,319
flowers at least from how I've been

515
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:04,200
doing it better that I get the flowers

516
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:08,678
to set the worse the flavor is that's

517
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:12,080
weird yeah yeah um and it it just it's

518
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,320
not like it doesn't last very long so

519
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,599
out of those two lines I'm hoping to

520
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,558
find something that's a little bit

521
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:23,798
easier to nail that has improvements on

522
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:26,960
like flavor and you know maybe a weird

523
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:29,240
twist to the smell yeah the appy one

524
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,840
sounds like a good good hold to climb

525
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,720
down for that too yeah that's that's

526
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:38,879
what I'm hoping that and you know the uh

527
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:42,558
I ran the wet dream yeah um and my buddy

528
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,679
down here Donnie he ran uh the dream

529
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:49,839
Killers okay and it seems I don't know

530
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,559
the that blue dream note in there really

531
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:55,678
like carries a quality factor to it in

532
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,399
this smoke I love blue dream like but

533
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,679
like again I got to qualify that most

534
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,360
people like when you say you love blue

535
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,360
dreams are like a I hate that [ __ ]

536
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,678
because they never got to smoke the cut

537
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:08,000
that we all grew back in the day and um

538
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,278
and and or if they did it probably

539
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,960
wasn't grown that well you know in some

540
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:14,400
people's you know chemistry doesn't line

541
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,000
up with I really love that cut the high

542
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,919
the quality um even the flavor like even

543
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,359
though it's like a terpinolene kind of

544
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:25,480
Base I don't know it's it's [ __ ]

545
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:28,158
rad yeah which I was one of those people

546
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,038
who hated on Blue Dream for a long time

547
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,320
cuz yeah you know me and my buddies back

548
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:36,440
in the day sold a lot of very bad Blue

549
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:41,720
Dream yeah um and it just like poured

550
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:44,919
into here for a long time yeah by the D

551
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,880
but the actual you know like actually

552
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:53,200
well done Blue Dream stuff is pretty

553
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:56,399
good man like killer killer

554
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,080
yeah yeah there's re that cut

555
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:02,959
up yeah I I have a couple of other

556
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:06,798
Shoreline hybrids also um the shoreline

557
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,840
by cough by Vietnam Black Oh Yeah from

558
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,720
H&amp;L the shoreline by mango Hayes uh also

559
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:16,158
from

560
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:20,399
H&amp;L and the shoreline by A5 backcross

561
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:23,159
from Louch oh nice in those I'm I'm more

562
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,759
like looking for you know just it that's

563
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,520
more of like an adventure like I'm

564
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,599
looking for weird new you know like

565
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,440
stuff that

566
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,398
you know hopefully is just super

567
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,558
radically different than you know than

568
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,599
normal yeah that's a great place to

569
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,918
start for

570
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,480
it all right is that is that about it

571
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,640
for you on that

572
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,319
one oh yeah I mean I'm look if there's

573
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,679
some other Blue Bonnet I I stay steady

574
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:56,720
popping Blue Bonnet hybrids better yeah

575
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,759
they're good man yeah yeah I I get stuck

576
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,519
with it for a reason you know

577
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:03,200
like it it's very hard to find a

578
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,918
anything that breeds true in the first

579
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,880
place and that's that reliably passes

580
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,278
traits um yeah it's just one of those

581
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
things where even as a from a breeding

582
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,839
perspective I don't even really think

583
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,119
about it from a a customer perspective I

584
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,720
think about it from a breeding

585
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,719
perspective um it's just really really

586
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,399
hard to nail that a perfect male that I

587
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,278
I think is perfect for breeding so yeah

588
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:29,479
I I still haven't really moved on I'm

589
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,119
just going through the hybrids now um

590
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,919
yeah probably going to reproduce

591
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,519
bubbleberry this summer we'll see how

592
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,200
that goes though we see okay Kyle what

593
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,839
you

594
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,519
got all right well uh see I'm looking

595
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,599
forward to uh the going through the

596
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,319
third round of these chocolate TI

597
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,398
Skittles the final final selections

598
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,359
because uh yeah now it's just narrowing

599
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,319
it down to basic you know what which

600
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:55,959
ones give me the the highest basically

601
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:57,798
like it I liked it you definitely got

602
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,880
that that funk the earthy funk in there

603
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,679
and those are the ones that I like that

604
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,240
yeah there was some other ones uh one

605
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,798
was we were talking about on the Discord

606
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,880
the other day it was actually dryer

607
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,440
sheets but more of a Downey Downey like

608
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,000
actual fabric maybe not dryer yeah it

609
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,360
was really weird uh that that the high

610
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,919
was okay on that one it was the the the

611
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,879
definitely not like the that that armpit

612
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:24,038
Funk that you know you said the Skittles

613
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,159
Cube the Z Cube yeah yeah yeah uh then

614
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:29,079
see what else uh I got coming up I got

615
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,559
some uh blue dream s1s

616
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:36,199
um Santa Cruz Rex uh see what else some

617
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:37,798
black poison from the Rev uh that was

618
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,880
are those I'm really looking forward to

619
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,079
because uh I end up finding out it was

620
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,320
an older pack and I recently got a hold

621
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,278
of him through email and uh he said

622
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,439
though he doesn't even recognize them so

623
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:49,960
he's pretty sure those are f1s based on

624
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,798
you know I sent him a leaf picture and

625
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,960
stuff like that yeah and so I'll

626
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,079
probably do something with those just to

627
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,640
make more seeds uh because I would

628
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,119
definitely want to look through f2s of

629
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,038
those because that has uh his own

630
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,199
Vietnam Black and then it also has his

631
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:08,359
uh old school Durban uh what he calls

632
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,278
Durban Poison Bros so and then it has

633
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:13,278
Neo black Russian in it so yeah that

634
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,038
definitely would that sounds pretty good

635
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,558
to me man to look through a little bit

636
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:21,000
of I love that line dude I I I I grew so

637
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,038
much black Russian stuff it's unreal uh

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,599
throughout my career like early on I

639
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,200
focused like I do with Bonnet like a

640
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,879
good seven or eight years I focused on

641
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,480
black Russian stuff Blackberry stuff so

642
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,278
yeah I like it yeah and then the other

643
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,640
stuff uh see I got some uh super Servo

644
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:44,599
Haze s1's tribute from old hog yeah uh

645
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:46,679
and then uh some cherry Mila f3s from

646
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:48,918
the Rev too so that's basically what I

647
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,360
got coming up for quite a bit so just

648
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,759
trying to get through all

649
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:56,599
those all right yeah well now we get

650
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:59,119
down to experimental

651
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:01,839
techniques so like anything you guys are

652
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,639
trying to incorporate um different

653
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,558
techniques

654
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:11,038
Technologies um and the potential risk

655
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:12,918
benefit you know ratios um you know this

656
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,278
isn't going to apply to everyone like

657
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,600
with me I I just stick with my [ __ ] like

658
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:19,960
haven't never tried LEDs like you know

659
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,480
what I mean so I know that's not going

660
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,079
to be for everyone but um if any of you

661
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,599
want to talk about this feel free to

662
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,519
speak up like if there's anything that

663
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:32,879
you've been incorporating new that maybe

664
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,880
you have't other wise or uh yeah

665
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,398
anybody free

666
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:43,640
shot uh about the only thing new that

667
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,360
I've been doing the past uh probably

668
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,919
like year or so has been adding um

669
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,879
hydrogen peroxide into the bottom of my

670
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,278
clone

671
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,278
tray yeah I've been digging that but

672
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:58,880
like growwise no I'm kind of stuck in my

673
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:02,759
wave yeah I feel you there

674
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,919
dude Sean you got anything yeah um I'm

675
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,720
pretty much stuck in my ways growwise I

676
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,200
I have thought you know about trying uh

677
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,798
Coco and you know doing that a little

678
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,960
bit or try a little bit of more like

679
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:20,798
Sanic um approach but man I'm busy with

680
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,120
work and everything and and you know I'm

681
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,079
just you know stuck in my ways not

682
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,798
really trying to to venture out until I

683
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:28,558
have a little bit more space where I can

684
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,519
uh have like an experimental

685
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:35,720
um area and then have you know kind of a

686
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,079
a main flower spot um and then yeah when

687
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,798
I have some more space then that's

688
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,278
probably when I'll try out some more new

689
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:44,158
things but nothing really like new new

690
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:48,319
techniques or anything that's like

691
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:52,480
cutting age or anything like that

692
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,879
yeah Kyle you got anything uh no nothing

693
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,319
because uh I was just waiting for the

694
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,440
new you know rev book you know make sure

695
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,678
go go pick that up yeah definely go by

696
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,360
that book um it there's a forward

697
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,320
written by probably by the most handsome

698
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,038
um seed maker ever so biggest dick check

699
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,079
it

700
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,679
out yeah I was waiting for that and I

701
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,199
just do I was just waiting for more of

702
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,278
the um little additions that he does

703
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,639
because uh after that reset I haven't

704
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,079
been doing I was just doing kind of

705
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:21,158
plain water and now I've I've just was

706
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:23,278
waiting to now he's kind I think he's

707
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,639
finished up with kind of his experiment

708
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,599
type stuff that where he's confident I

709
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,519
think where he's got his grow where he

710
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,839
wants it so I was just wa kind of

711
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,960
waiting for that type thing so yeah so

712
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:38,839
real quick Kyle do either of us that you

713
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,480
know of have the 1979 calendar or is

714
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:43,519
that one of the ones that was missing uh

715
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,960
which one because actually I what I'm

716
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,558
finding out is there is actually the

717
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,079
Cannabis calendar started 73 and those

718
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,278
are not the Brotherhood of Eternal L

719
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,000
ones okay yeah no this one's the um CIA

720
00:31:53,278 --> 00:32:00,240
one yeah okay now that one that one is

721
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,038
from KO it's from who the K yeah so

722
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,359
that's that's the sensia techniques yeah

723
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,558
and I I I have that one okay I finally

724
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,879
got it on the way I'm stoked yeah yeah

725
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,000
those are and then there is other ones

726
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,159
of those I think there's two other ones

727
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
of those okay that makes sense that that

728
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,240
would be Kos then yeah yeah yeah those

729
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
and actually yeah the pictures are some

730
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,440
of the ones that are in the book The

731
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,159
Sense Media technique okay yeah they're

732
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,000
just bigger which is is really cool it's

733
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,120
a cool calender yeah they're really cool

734
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,960
actually I I picked up a few I just got

735
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,239
another one too it's I posted the the

736
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,440
cover but I got to open up the package

737
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,480
so it's a the cultivator 77 uh calendar

738
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,639
oh really yeah I have that one no these

739
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,679
are I've been picking up a lot of

740
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:43,278
different ones I have a normal 76 one

741
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,080
which has a double cover it's missing

742
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,000
two things I have a lot of weird I've

743
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,558
been finding a lot of Crazy Ones man

744
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,480
it's really yeah we scanning them we

745
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,720
scanning them oh yeah they're all in

746
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,880
they're all in Discord and also yeah on

747
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,159
the thing oh yeah so yeah for for people

748
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,559
who don't know we have stuff like that

749
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,600
in the Discord

750
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:04,079
um like a lot of these old calendars

751
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:07,519
have a lot of the old I mean pictures of

752
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:11,879
the strains like the aapu gold the

753
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,679
Panama Red um W Hawkins Guerin stuff

754
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,440
that like we hear about today and um

755
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,639
maybe you'll see Barney's Farm say they

756
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,440
sell um but that's not really the case

757
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:24,798
and to have point of origin like time of

758
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,038
origin pictures and to be able to look

759
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:30,359
at those be able to get whatever you

760
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,679
know visual data points and traits that

761
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,158
you can see um is super helpful

762
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:38,159
especially when they describe it you

763
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:41,200
know like uh word for word like um R are

764
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,320
The Connoisseur used to do so yeah um

765
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,319
yeah that 79 has a uh has some great

766
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,439
pictures of Colombian in there and and

767
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,480
what I noticed is they have have a lot

768
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,679
of serration oh interesting yeah so

769
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,599
that's what that was that was that's

770
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,919
what I took away from it and I don't

771
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,480
know now I don't know what they did to

772
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,600
it but they were going I don't think

773
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,319
they would have just you know spent a

774
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,000
lot of time they were trying to hide it

775
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,599
so yeah for sure especially in those

776
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,798
pictures they're all tied down and stuff

777
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:08,118
so I don't think they would have been

778
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:09,480
cutting off serration so yeah I just

779
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,039
that's one thing I took away from that

780
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,039
so I thought that was interesting that

781
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,320
is interesting yeah I think someone on

782
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:17,599
the show before was saying that

783
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,159
columbium was also

784
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,480
rated yeah yeah anyway um yeah sorry for

785
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,320
the aside yeah we on that I know I just

786
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:33,398
nerd out on like I just just saw it pop

787
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:37,000
up on he got it um what makes a keeper

788
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:39,559
for you guys so uh

789
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,960
Sean this is kind of a rough I don't

790
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,239
know man it's kind of an on the spot

791
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:49,679
question um what makes a keeper for

792
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:54,078
you um so I do like to pick um based off

793
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:57,240
of structure but then also um so

794
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,800
structure it's you know how how quickly

795
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,679
it'll grow

796
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,119
um I usually don't like things that are

797
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,519
too slow in veg I like you know be able

798
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,599
to do like a if I'm doing like a quick

799
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,599
seed run do like four to six weeks um

800
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,880
and then be good enough to run them some

801
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,920
things from seed if I'm just trying to

802
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,838
do like a quick uh run to see what see

803
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,960
what they're about you know will take

804
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:24,119
you know two months or or so the veg and

805
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,039
and even running from clone may you know

806
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,720
take um double the time than it would

807
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,960
than the one that are much quicker in

808
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:37,039
seed form um so so I do like things that

809
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,800
grow a bit quicker um and then the

810
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,519
plants that like to support themselves

811
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,039
um not much

812
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:48,759
staking um obviously there are ones that

813
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,679
um you need a steak and and they're

814
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,760
they're amazing plants and it that's

815
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,639
just something you have to deal with um

816
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:01,359
but I do like um a more sturdy structure

817
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:03,000
that is is vigorous and and then um

818
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:07,000
yields not necessarily the most

819
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
important thing to me

820
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:14,240
uh sometimes it's nice but I'd rather

821
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:17,560
have the the flavor translate fully and

822
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:21,078
and be mouth coding as long and then as

823
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,920
long and then as well as have um the

824
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,400
effects you

825
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,519
know be what I'm looking for um whether

826
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,400
it's it's something for for the

827
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:35,119
daytime um to have at work or or just

828
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,599
you know nighttime you know try and just

829
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,358
chill relax um maybe just you know

830
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,800
completely take the the mind off of

831
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,119
things and and for you know just forget

832
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,440
and be able to zone out and and get some

833
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:52,480
good sleep um so really those are kind

834
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:57,159
of the parameters I'm kind of selecting

835
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,159
off of um mostly effects uh being number

836
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,519
one

837
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:04,358
effects and then flavor and then

838
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:08,759
structure um there have been plants that

839
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:12,519
were more floppy that I really do love

840
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,560
um but I do you know prefer plants that

841
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:17,119
have a little bit more sturdy structure

842
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:20,838
that don't necessarily have to stake or

843
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,200
um trellis too much um but I will

844
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:26,559
trellis or stake those heavily if you

845
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:28,879
know if needed like the original sin um

846
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,559
some of those needed more heavier

847
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,000
staking and things like that and you

848
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:37,880
know I love those um the the appy

849
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,760
diesels those were actually like pretty

850
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:45,559
pretty sturdy um they didn't much

851
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,599
staking the couple fenos I really liked

852
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:52,358
um they got really like nice big and

853
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,920
bushy um but yeah I I love plants you

854
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:56,960
know just the flavor the fla and it has

855
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,039
to be mouth coating um if I'm going to

856
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,920
keep it

857
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:03,000
for the flavor wise um there so many so

858
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:09,240
many jokes I'm holding back right

859
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:12,519
now let them go all day all day every

860
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:16,000
time yeah yeah it's gonna be uh you're

861
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:20,159
gonna put on the soundboard in a

862
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,559
second my yeah I think I think that's it

863
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,679
um you know effects and then you know

864
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:28,599
flavor and and then you know structure

865
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,598
after that

866
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:34,079
all right screw what you got what is

867
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:38,079
your definition to be

868
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:40,880
keeper uh I mean really it's just more

869
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,519
it's stuff that I want to smoke you know

870
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,800
cuz I only

871
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:49,239
smoke like what I grow and what my

872
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,960
friends you know in our little group

873
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:56,318
down here grow

874
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:59,480
um but I guess to to kind of use a a

875
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:04,480
phrase that that local said

876
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:07,440
um I like weed with character like so

877
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,000
whether that you know the only stuff

878
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,119
that I really don't like is Citrus types

879
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,400
honestly like everything else I mean if

880
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,079
if it's good it's good I came into the

881
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,119
syndicate with a lot of like I don't

882
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,200
like this I don't like that and then

883
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,280
just through like growing and like

884
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:28,559
trying my friends who were growing you

885
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,000
know other stuff found good types of

886
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:34,719
that like I didn't used to like fruit

887
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:39,000
types you know yeah that's fair you know

888
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:42,358
but if if it's good it's good

889
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,719
yeah all right Kyle what makes it keeper

890
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:47,799
for you uh pretty much everything that

891
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,639
Sean said basically I mean effect uh I

892
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,000
mean taste uh then structure and then

893
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,039
you know if it's going to be a pain in

894
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,920
my ass uh over time I definitely don't

895
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,880
want it because I noticed that her stuff

896
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,318
especially clones after about uh a year

897
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
and a half two that's when they start

898
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:04,279
getting kind of funky yeah and then that

899
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,598
that's usually when I've already ran

900
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,359
them about twice by then usually because

901
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,559
I don't usually I don't run seed I run

902
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:14,559
everything from Cuts yeah um so yeah

903
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:17,480
that that' be that for me what it is

904
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,759
yeah all right um if you guys want to

905
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,240
give any examples of any keepers that

906
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,920
you have um I don't know if you guys

907
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,399
have already done that or not like

908
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,159
trying to think back into our

909
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,039
conversation um mine would just be the

910
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,719
banana tie so Banana as of right now so

911
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:37,279
[ __ ] the world yeah yeah Sean what do

912
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,879
you got currently um I have none but of

913
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,800
of what just because of the work being

914
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,838
done and not being able to keep things

915
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,560
but of what I'm gonna go back through um

916
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:49,279
to look for Keepers that I already know

917
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:51,358
offand are going to be Santa Cruz wreck

918
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,560
um

919
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,838
eappi the the electri booo appy um and

920
00:40:54,559 --> 00:41:01,759
then original sin and then that ation

921
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:04,759
Diesel and then I do want to go back

922
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,000
into the blue resin to look through that

923
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,400
line more as well um there's some

924
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,318
phenomenal plants in that um that I that

925
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,358
I need to just go back through and and

926
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:18,639
do a larger pop and try and find the one

927
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:20,559
I want to keep yeah there's some wild

928
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,519
testing plants in that line I've told

929
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,279
people before but I don't know um it

930
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,519
doesn't really stick but yeah like

931
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,960
anomalous anomalously Wild testing

932
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:34,280
plants in there um that kush cut from

933
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,960
resin long was just something else I had

934
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,640
one that was like blueberry cotton candy

935
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,679
yeah was just like and then maybe like a

936
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,118
little bit of earthiness on the back end

937
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,838
that was just like really really good

938
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,720
dude once you hit once you hit real

939
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,880
blueberry like that actually tastes and

940
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:54,000
smells like it no going back what about

941
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,000
you

942
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:01,280
screw uh I I hold on to a lot of things

943
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:03,399
right now um but there's some stuff that

944
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,280
you know I don't know I who knows how

945
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,039
many years I'll hold on to it onto it uh

946
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:12,519
like because I the way I see it if I

947
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:15,358
find something that fulfills that like

948
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:18,679
same role and is better then I'll just

949
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:22,838
keep that yeah makes sense you know like

950
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:25,879
I have uh I went through so for instance

951
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:30,239
like I have uh tusin leather uh number

952
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:34,480
one TUS my Budd yeah that my buddy

953
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,838
popped and uh it's kind of citrusy but I

954
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,280
guess

955
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:42,719
um I don't know I guess it's like a it's

956
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:46,480
super complex though still it's the um

957
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:50,439
and when I when I ran the uh Death in

958
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,480
Venice it was pretty much the same um

959
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,920
type of smells and flavors and stuff

960
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:00,039
just way worse yeah uh same with the

961
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,318
effects and all that so yeah um like

962
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:06,440
right now I'm holding on triangle choke

963
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:09,039
is something that I'm I love to death

964
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,720
and I've been I don't think I'll be

965
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:15,519
dropping that one

966
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:17,279
um anytime soon at least uh I I mean I

967
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,519
do want to go through four more packs of

968
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,119
it to see if you know like if I found

969
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:26,000
that out of two yeah imagine yeah if I

970
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:31,480
could find a better version of it hell

971
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:35,880
yeah um right same with uh the chemis S1

972
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,000
by Blue Bonnet yeah um I saw the

973
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,599
potential in it and like don't get me

974
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,599
wrong it's good it's the cut that I hold

975
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:48,160
on to is good yeah um it just the

976
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:52,039
earthiness really kind of like comes in

977
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:55,239
full force at the end and Bullies the

978
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:58,279
the blueberry and like the nasty so in

979
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:00,719
in in that blueberry there is earthiness

980
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,280
in some of those expressions and that's

981
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,639
everything I've tried breeding away from

982
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,359
because it is so strong in DJ's

983
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,838
blueberry so strong and it's just the

984
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,480
one thing because it can overpower the

985
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:13,358
berry part to where you just kind of

986
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,400
like yeah I smell the berry you know so

987
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,759
those are the ones I always tried to

988
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,400
breed away from it's it sucks and when

989
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,319
you cross it to something like kimd that

990
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,200
also has earthiness to it or chem the

991
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:26,719
chem ss1 which is like a u very similar

992
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,919
to KMD and it's a cannaboid scent

993
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,118
expression

994
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,440
um yeah that that earthiness is

995
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,720
definitely in

996
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,000
there yeah it I'm I'm actually seeing

997
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,519
that in the uh the bubbleberry that I'm

998
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,679
that I have at week four right now it's

999
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:45,800
like moldy blueberries not like bubble

1000
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:50,000
yay blueberry it smells like has a lot

1001
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:52,599
of earthiness in it too a lot like a lot

1002
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,280
it could be very hard to work against uh

1003
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:59,039
very dominant very very dominant type

1004
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,040
strain when you cross to it

1005
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,598
yeah all right

1006
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,880

mango hay stuff and and run and run some

1022
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:46,519
unique stuff um I mean I I guess it's

1023
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,359
kind of said every show but you know

1024
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:51,838
don't keep running what everyone else is

1025
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:53,799
running do something unique um but yeah

1026
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:58,920
that's that's probably about it don't be

1027
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:01,200
a cheap B uh screw which you

1028
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:05,639
got uh well I guess it's something we're

1029
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:09,799
going to cover over uh later but the

1030
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:14,799
whole clone chasing game oh yeah it you

1031
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:18,200
know I I chased one thing for 16 years

1032
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,760
before getting it and now I'm ready to D

1033
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:23,239
like I'm way more excited about the

1034
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,680
hybrids yeah and the stuff that y'all

1035
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:29,358
can find in seed is if you choose the

1036
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:32,519
right seed like I totally get if you're

1037
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:35,719
popping funky [ __ ] and just kind of like

1038
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:37,838
getting a you know mids roller

1039
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:39,838
coaster then it doesn't seem like it's

1040
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:43,599
worth it and like that's all you'll need

1041
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:47,119
to elevate your grow but n just get

1042
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:50,318
legit seeds grow it like a normal person

1043
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,760
don't you know do a bunch of weird [ __ ]

1044
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:55,759
like we see some people come in talking

1045
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,880
about yeah yep and you you'll do all

1046
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:02,280
right yeah man the Clone chasing game's

1047
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,880
brutal I did that with hp13 forever

1048
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,040
forever and the hybrids are so much

1049
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,318
better than the Clone but it was because

1050
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,440
like back when I was young read the

1051
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,920
canab Bible and it was like oh this is

1052
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,240
the one so of course I'm like oh this is

1053
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,400
the one that's the one I'm gonna chase

1054
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:21,159
that and everybody was chasing it and

1055
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,880
nobody would give it up nobody and then

1056
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:25,199
you finally get it all these years later

1057
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,480
it's like

1058
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:31,960
oh that's that's cool

1059
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:34,079
you know um yeah let like it's it is the

1060
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,318
difference between Elite clones and your

1061
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:40,200
own Keepers and being able to run

1062
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,679
through seeds teaches you a lot like the

1063
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:43,719
people that are selecting a lot of these

1064
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,318
quote unquote Elite clones are doing it

1065
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:48,719
from like one or two seeds in a pop in a

1066
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:51,039
closet and like it's just how well they

1067
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,838
hype it um who their friends are that

1068
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,960
they pass it to and that makes the

1069
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:57,400
difference between an elite versus your

1070
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,599
own Keeper in my opinion

1071
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,400
uh I don't know if any of you guys have

1072
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:04,119
opinions on that and they there're you

1073
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,880
know you have no idea how high the

1074
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:10,680
likelihood that they picked that one

1075
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,079
over you know a sibling because of the

1076
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:17,039
marketability or the bag of you know

1077
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:22,000
like stuff that you might not care about

1078
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:23,880
as as a factor yeah yeah

1079
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,960
absolutely I mean like do you guys have

1080
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:30,240
any opinions on Elite clones versus your

1081
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:32,559
own keepers Sean Kyle either of

1082
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,239
you uh well what I've noticed from

1083
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,280
Elites because there's certain stuff

1084
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,598
that just doesn't uh what people think

1085
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,000
of elite like Cam and Bubba uh those

1086
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,200
highs for me are not what they are for

1087
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,358
other people yeah uh they're more just

1088
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,960
kind of whatever so cam has always been

1089
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,358
more sativa uh High what people would

1090
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,159
call that I hate using that word but I

1091
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,440
know that's how people can kind of

1092
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:55,838
identify what I'm talking about uh and I

1093
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,960
think they're more breeders they're

1094
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,480
better breeders I I found the Bubba

1095
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,679
hybrids have always been really good for

1096
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,440
me but I've never had good just plain

1097
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,159
Bubba to me um maybe it could have been

1098
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,559
the grow but I've tried different ones

1099
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,719
over the years and that's always just

1100
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:13,440
been the same uh but I always like the

1101
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:15,798
hybrids so I think to me what Elite is

1102
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,159
uh for clones is always maybe they're

1103
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:20,639
better breeders they're not always good

1104
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,598
as smoke yeah so type of thing that's

1105
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,318
what I

1106
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:26,920
found and obviously my Keepers is I'm

1107
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,759
looking for I'm looking for good smoke

1108
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:33,599
because it's all hits for me so

1109
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,400
yeah all right you haven't had uh any

1110
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,480
experience growing any Elite clones or

1111
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,838
anything um like that but I say that's

1112
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,119
Pro it's also kind of subjective um

1113
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:44,960
obviously there's ones that have just

1114
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:47,920
been around for a long time um that

1115
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,039
everyone kind of unanimously agrees on

1116
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,599
but then there's other ones you know

1117
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:54,318
that have been around a long time that

1118
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,760
um not too many people have have seen

1119
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,759
and then like um screw was saying like

1120
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,920
he was chasing in Shoreline and whatnot

1121
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,000
and I'm pretty sure that's a cut that's

1122
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,480
like pretty difficult to get yeah yeah

1123
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,639
there's a lot of fake Shoreline out

1124
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,358
there for so many years because the main

1125
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:13,199
guy who had it dipped offline for a long

1126
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:15,639
time yeah that's that's a long time to

1127
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:19,598
you know Chase something and then not be

1128
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:21,598
completely you know thrilled about it um

1129
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,519
I've never been one that even try and go

1130
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,119
and buy any clones from anyone or any of

1131

1137
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:42,679
interested in growing um but I'm more

1138
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:44,679
interested in growing people's uh

1139
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,919
selections that they found kind out of

1140
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:51,879
like recent recent things you know yeah

1141
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,119
um so you know just I don't want to end

1142
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,400
up getting someone's old clone you know

1143
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,358
and end up

1144
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,358
having it just destroy

1145
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:08,280
everything you know that's been

1146
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:09,598
my Theo thp M yeah yeah that's been my

1147
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,680
thing also with not wanting to get

1148
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,318
clones I I and I'm a person that kind of

1149
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,639
likes to to do things on their own um so

1150
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,079
I'm trying to find something from seeds

1151
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:21,960
and and you know kind of then breed that

1152
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:24,440
into something that I then enjoy myself

1153
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,159
or just find something from seed that I

1154
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,358
really enjoy and just keep that and be

1155
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:33,239
