best [ __ ] in the world was created by

164
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,800
accident so I think to myself like if I

165
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,318
pop these seeds maybe you know I find

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,960
something cool I think it's also you

167
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,439
know when you're talking about like the

168
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,918
breeder Syndicate some of these guys

169
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,680
they make seeds so being able to pop

170
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,680
some of their work you know be some of

171
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,840
the first people to check that out some

172
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,598
of these people like H&amp;L and and pop and

173
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,638
you know goat farm seeds and stuff like

174
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,918
that you know they they really know

175
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,759
their [ __ ] they have a lot of experience

176
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,120
in making seeds and working with

177
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,080
genetics and and have a lot of cuts and

178
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,319
let's be real like I'm Chucky the [ __ ]

179
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,079
pollins I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,680
doing so I really you know I look to

181
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,758
them guys to kind of guide my hand in it

182
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,400
where I'm going maybe not my to my

183
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,720
destination but just uh you know you

184
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,279
know it's fun to pop seeds who don't

185
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,720
like the pop seeds what the [ __ ] what

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,799
kind of question is yeah I mean you know

187
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,080
we could you could also talk about

188
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,639
sharing clothes and sometimes it's like

189
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,000
trying to share your

190
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,478
cousin you can get those diseases that

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,839
pass back and forth between you and your

192
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:49,719
friends real fast yeah viruses STDs

193
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,318
viruses yeah what have you I got cold

194
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,240
sords out the yin gang I don't need no

195
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,000
more [ __ ] exactly yeah that shit's rough

196
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,120
man um yeah no really it's a it's a real

197
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,800
thing so you you're you're likely to

198
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,519
find you know the Hops slat and vroid in

199
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,918
seed pops um we don't really know the

200
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,639
seed transmission rate but it is a lot

201
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:14,000
less than playing with clones so yeah

202
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:16,120
there is that yeah I mean there's that I

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,879
mean that we I mean you know just as

204
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,840
well as me Matt I mean just in the last

205
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,039
few months I've seen a few cases of of

206
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,239
diseases and viruses and stuff like that

207
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,199
so it's like it ain't a joke you guys

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,319
don't [ __ ] around with these clones

209
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:35,278
dropping 300 400 00,000 on a [ __ ]

210
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,080
clone and then you get germs bro bugs

211
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,918
stuff like that I try to tell people if

212
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,000
you know if someone's selling you clones

213
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,439
it's very likely they're not in the

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,480
position to have the Clones that they're

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,560
selling or they would be kicked out of a

216
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,200
lot of these trade circles where those

217
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,679
clones exist um so if someone's doing

218
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,480
that it's usually like a last ditch

219
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,679
effort they're all out of money and

220
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,879
that's scary sending money to someone

221
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,519
who's all out of money because you never

222
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,838
know what their the Jam's going to be

223
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,600
y yeah it's just a lot of people making

224
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,000
false scarcity on their Elite selections

225
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,800
and usually there's Elite selections are

226
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,200
a seed pop of three maximum yeah there's

227
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,879
always that it's it's like you tell me

228
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,440
Matt and you give great advice you said

229
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,320
there's only like a handful of people to

230
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,160
have access to most of the Clones out

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,920
there bro so it's

232
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,240
like are you really do you really got

233
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,120
what you think you got or do you just

234
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,919
get scammed you know what I mean like

235
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,078
yeah you know it's math bro you probably

236
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,958
got scammed yeah there were a lot of

237
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:42,000
people buying the jel cut off of a an

238
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,439
individual and um I got so many messages

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,039
about that and it was it was bummer

240
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,920
because every single time I'd have to be

241
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,399
like bro I hate to break it to you and I

242
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,919
was always the bearer of bad news you

243
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,440
know so I don't like doing that so don't

244
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,319
be don't be spending stupid money on

245
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,279
clones go pop some seeds yeah again they

246
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,440
are very rare clones it's very rare a

247
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,000
clone is like dog [ __ ] where everybody

248
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,920
that smokes it kind of universal degrees

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,759
they dig it it's very very rare and

250
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,639
that's why I could pull that out of the

251
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:07,958
air because I mean even jel there's a

252
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,399
lot of people who don't like jel because

253
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,719
it Herms and it's a pain in the ass so

254
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,240
you know just because I like it don't

255
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,079
mean you will right yeah I mean dude

259
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,518
many good there's not so many I should

260
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,200
say there's there's a solid core of

261
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,919
people especially like in the Discord

stuff dude and they're working with a

265
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,839
lot of the Clones that people are hyped

266
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,480
about anyway so it's like yeah [ __ ] I

359
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:30,600
lifetime opportunity

360
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,680
it's

361
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,720
great yeah uh meeting my heroes I think

362
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,879
um I think in the weed world it's been

363
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,320
rather lackluster um some people like

364
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,919
hyen Lon first time I met him I mean he

365
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,480
was already a good friend by that time

366
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,799
but um getting to meet him was special

367
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,879
there there are several people that have

368
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,639
been quite quite amazing when we get to

369
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,799
meet him and uh not disappointments but

370
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,639
guys like DJ Short um he told me that I

371
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,799
didn't even own my own company he's like

372
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,120
oh I think someone else owns your

373
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,519
company I'm pretty sure and it was a

374
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,000
nice dude that he was referring to but I

375
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,039
was like no that's uh that's that's mine

376
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,360
pretty sure pretty sure the only one

377
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,958
that

378
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,278
um pry sure I'm the only one that uh

379
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,399
owns this a horrible company so yeah I

380
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,240
don't think people would take credit for

381
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,799
it but yeah you know and trying to talk

382
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,159
to him about his strains it became

383
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,519
evident that he wasn't at least at that

384
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,000
day that time he wasn't too into talking

385
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,879
about anything having to do with his own

386
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,318
strains and I thought you know if

387
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,799
someone knows your lines this well would

388
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:32,759
see they put in the time and effort to

389
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,639
ask good questions you would respond but

390
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,240
yeah no he wasn't into it um did that

391
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,240
let you down at all bro I can't let me

392
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,000
down I was like dude I get to meet talk

393
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,360
to DJ Short spend time he's at my booth

394
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,399
and uh yeah no it was it was absolutely

395
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,240
horrible I got to meet NCGA North C GRS

396
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,399
Association he's a old school head for

397
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,120
back in the day and um he was cool

398
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,480
really cool shared he was the first

399
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,278
person to share a boo space with me at

400
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,278
Emerald cup so um there are times when

401
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:03,399
it's cool and there are times when it

402
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:06,278
really sucks so maybe you don't want to

403
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,519
say their name but what what's what's

404
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:11,198
one time maybe that you had an

405
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,799
impression of somebody in the game and

406
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,278
it ended up being the complete opposite

407
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,439
that you were like the coolest cat you

408
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:19,120
ever met in

409
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,040
life the coolest cat I ever met

410
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,600
um okay so

411
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,519
CSI right the first time I met him in

412
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
person we had already been at kind of I

413
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,519
don't want to say at odds but we didn't

414
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,439
talk to each other we weren't tight

415
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,560
that's for Hampshire and um I didn't my

416
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,639
impression of him was that he was

417
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,518
probably a conceited dick and you know

418
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,278
it was too cool for school so I walked

419
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,440
up to him I he was at the booth next to

420
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,318
me and I walked up to him just shook his

421
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,319
hand introduced myself and left and

422
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,919
after that we were best friends it was

423
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:49,278
uh it was weird yeah he ended up being

424
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,439
the coolest guy on Earth and not not a

425
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,958
conceeded dick at all quite the opposite

426
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,800
that's that's really cool bro he seems a

427
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:59,119
really cool I I'll be honest if it

428
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,719
wasn't for him I probably wouldn't even

429
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,240
know about like the breeder Syndicate

430
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,360
for real because he you know I've seen

431
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,838
him on a panel like years ago and kind

432
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,759
of when I got out of jail or whatever

433
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,198
and I just like i' had been locked up

434
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,078

435
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,199
and uh you know I didn't I hadn't really

436
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:19,318

503
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,918
President and even then I doubt it until

504
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,199
they have it all lined up so they could

505
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,240
take it from the Mom and Pops that's how

506

508

510
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,439

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,079
questions on here y'all trying to get us

512
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,080
as canell they're in here saying

513
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:43,239
dirty um it says Uh George Jetson says

514
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:46,359
untopped or topped plants preference for

515
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,279
cropping versus breeding uh the plant

516
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:52,279
that got away oh I guess that's one

517
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,038
thing untp or top plants preference for

518
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:57,319
cropping versus breeding depends if it's

519
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,119
a squat little Afghan you don't top it

520
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,319
um

521
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,319
otherwise I mean for breeding you want

522
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,599
to have as many sites as you can get so

523
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:08,158
you can fill up uh all those nice little

524
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:10,759
bracks with seeds yeah so it just

525
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:15,000
depends uh and then the second part was

526
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:17,879

around to bubba cut that they call La

540

usually every three months we send out

567
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,240

568

580
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,640
that we've been doing it's like he

581
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,559
released the k91 to the mango haes and

582
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,480
he he said he's probably not ever going

583
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,399
[ __ ] drop it ever bro so it's like

584
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,519
it's just cool [ __ ] like that if you

585
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,200
want to be in on the early stuff I guess

586
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:44,319
uh let's see here we got a couple of

587
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:47,400
ones here from biscuit flipper he says

588
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,759
origin story SLB background on the

589
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,798
sharing cut of white

590
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,960
widow maybe do you want me to keep

591
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:55,480
reading the rest of it because he's got

592
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,558
a bunch of stuff here he says I I I read

593
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,839
it was from lonar and it was and was was

594
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,798
wondering when it came about have a

595
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,639
buddy who's trying to track it down and

596
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:09,079
is wondering if it's the one he had up

597
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:12,400
near Dallas back in the mid 90s he might

598
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:14,439
just pay 500 for the cut if so okay so

599
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,960
first off I will say there's been some

600
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,320
debate about someone selling the cut I

601
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,120
won't say the the gentleman and gentle

602
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,960
woman's name but be careful who you buy

603
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,678
that [ __ ] from there is one for sale

604
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,440
that you can buy and it looks like a

605
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,440
[ __ ] Bubba cush cut that's not

606
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,960
[ __ ] Sharon Widow Sharon is really

607
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,558
[ __ ] ugly um really really hard to

608
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,960
grow you get the Leaf curl it's just

609
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,079
never [ __ ] happy big huge colas it's

610
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,038
not a short squat little Afghan not

611
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:45,798
super Frosty not really resinous um came

612
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:48,839
from Lone Star originally and you know

613
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:51,119
mid 2000s early early to mid 2000s out

614
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,439
of Texas I don't know what White Widow

615
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,359
cut what I don't think uh Lone Star was

616
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,200
passing that cut around openly so I

617
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,879
doubt it was just some cut someone got

618
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,558
as White Widow in Texas

619
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,200
very much doubt that um right now the

620
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,200
only person I know with it for sure is

621
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,640
crazy composer um he's got great

622
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,720
pictures of it up so if you want to see

623
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,200
the real Sharon Widow go check out his

624
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,360
Instagram um but yeah other than that

625
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,679
like I don't really know anybody passing

626
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:19,879
it around or selling it so don't go

627
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,919
buying cuts of Sharon Widow unless you

628
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,278
get it directly from composer or

629
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,360

the open pollenating do you use one male

642
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,840
or multiple ones and if you use multiple

643
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,399
how do you go about moving forward or

644
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,439
back Crossing when you don't know who

645
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:12,079
the daddy is also speak on reversing of

646
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
males to

647
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,399
females okay so open pollinating means

648
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,599
you're taking every seed you have

649
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,278
hitting every so every male with every

650
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,719
female that's that's open and

651
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:27,000
pollinating um it's a good question like

652
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,480
uh how do you know when what Daddy was

653
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,640
it if you want to take it forward you

654
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,079
don't you go by traits um you won't know

655
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,159
what Daddy hit what so it's not like

656
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,798
saving clones of each one is advisable

657
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,399
uh of the males when you're doing an

658
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,480
open pollination because you can't just

659
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,719
think oh [ __ ] that was that made some

660
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,558
heat you know because you just won't

661
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,839
know um you could

662
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,839
do an open pollination and then also

663
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,240
take be very careful with the pollen

664
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,918
from each male and uh hit a clone of

665
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,519
each female if you want to go that way

666
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,679
that's also directional um yeah if you

667
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,918
want to work it forward you just work it

668
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,480
Forward by traits you don't work it

669
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,679
Forward by U what potential male hit

670
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,919
what potential female it's all about

671
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,320
trait work at that point um what was the

672
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,000
other question male male reversals onto

673
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,839
females

674
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,200
yeah um so people people have this weird

675
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,519
idea of reversals uh males don't if you

676
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,919
reverse a male it's not going to just

677
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,480
turn into an allout female like that

678
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,559
that's not really going to happen that's

679
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,798
not what it looks like it looks like uh

680
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:32,158
um a few BRS on a male like female on a

681
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:34,558
mail um making seeds with it it's a

682
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,760
novel fun idea but like there's I don't

683
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,639
really know anybody's ever found

684
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,240
anything in a male reversal usually

685
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,240
you're doing that just to check out any

686
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,399
traits any any visual or scent traits

687
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,159
from the male side so when you run the

688
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:51,319
progyny um of anything from that plant

689
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,519
uh in a not reversed portion you can see

690
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:54,000
the traits come through and you be like

691
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,200
okay this is from the mail because I saw

692
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,440
that in the turfs but it doesn't always

693
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,919
mean that those traits are going to pop

694
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,159
up just because you can identify them or

695
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,440
uh or you've witnessed them at one point

696
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:09,200
cool all right uh we got another one

697
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,038
from stone or stone Farm okay oh man the

698
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,480
[ __ ] pizza rolls mom made me killing

699
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,038
me bro how can I really tell the

700
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,000
difference between pistols Browning due

701
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:21,720
to pollination versus pistols Browning

702
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,759
sorry I'm a new grower if this is a dumb

703
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,240
question it's not a dumb question um I

704
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:27,839
mean it's just all depends on timing

705
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,038
right like if it's a week after you've

706
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,359
hit all the plants then you hope that

707
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:35,798
that's going to be from pollinating but

708
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,558
yeah they pistols Brown they die off

709
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:43,000
that they die off and yeah I think it's

710
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:45,158
actually stigmas not pistols but um yeah

711
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,398
I mean that's it's it's that and then

712
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,120
you know if it's pollinated you'll see

713
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,759
the bra slowly start to swell then

714
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,239
you'll know for sure yeah I mean you're

715
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,720
not pollinating at the end of a a a

716
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,679
plant's life cycle right when you're

717
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,399
going to be seeing brown browning hairs

718
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,360
or whatever anyways you're if you're

719
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,599
gonna be hitting something with pollen

720
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,678
you're usually doing it within you know

721
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:06,158
a week anywhere from depending on what

722
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,919
you're growing anywhere from like two to

723
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,559
like week four maybe even longer if

724
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,120
you're [ __ ] with other [ __ ] hazes and

725
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:13,639
longer flowering types but I mean you're

726
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,639
not there's so majority of the time all

727
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,640
the hairs are white so when you hit them

728
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,919
usually within a couple days depending

729
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,159
some some take a week some some are two

730
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,278
days you start seeing some kind of

731
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,120
coloration or or I'm dying back or what

732
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,798
or I guess a little bit but yeah it's

733
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,038
it's yeah

734
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,119
but uh all right yeah uh scrw we can't

735
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,079
answer or we can't we're trying to keep

736
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:38,000
this a good show bro we're trying we're

737
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:42,519
try not to get banned here bro or

738
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,720
whatever did Dan ask I I shouldn't ask

739
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,679
probably that's right guys drop some

740
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,679
likes drop some supports we appreciate

741
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,960
it there you go yeah we're live ask

742
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,159
questions too yeah ask questions if you

743
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,360
want you know whatever ask Matt you got

744
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,640
Matt here it's a rare opportunity also

745
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,240
while we're talking about these some of

746
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,880
these questions we've have been asked

747
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,640
before and I know some people tuning in

748
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,960
our big time [ __ ] big wiener experts

749
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,799
and are thinking these are little newbie

750
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,000
questions but guys we got new people

751
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:10,119
coming in every day we got to help them

752
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,398
on their on their Journey right so at

753
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,158
the end of the day I would recommend

754
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:15,518
though to new people go back and watch

755
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,039
the old episodes because you know a lot

756
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,240
of these questions are on the old

757
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,960
episodes guys just watch watch them it's

758
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,120
good that's a weird question I've never

759
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,079
heard this

760
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,918
term have you used doe design of

761
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,240
experiments to choose your males for

762
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,480
example have you have you have five

763
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,720
females and two males you hit each male

764
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,759
to complete set of females take Serious

765
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,159
pollen control yeah I don't play with

766
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,720
that I don't play with multiple male

767
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,080
unless I'm doing an open pollination and

768
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,440
that's only then I don't use more than

769
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,879
one male because yes takes serious

770
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,320
pollen control and pollen contamination

771
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,880
is it just doesn't take much so no I

772
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,079
only do one male to to females but then

773
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,000
again like there's there's one thing

774
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:02,240
that none of us ever really talk about

775
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,679
and it is what happens when a plant

776
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,599
Herms in a room in a room that you've uh

777
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,880
you know dusted with a male that that's

778
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:14,558
a question I got right so yeah here so

779
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,880
you're a breeder right you got you're

780
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,038
doing your little Chuck or whatever

781
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,559
reversal or whatever you're doing you

782
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,200
got a Herman there you realize after you

783
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:25,480
made all this seed at the end of the day

784
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,960
say you got a whole room full right you

785
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,319
realize at the end of the day as you're

786
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,278
going through these buds stuff you're

787
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,678
seeing maybe some little plant in the

788
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:34,960
corner that you didn't notice and she

789
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,120
hmed out and it's the pin's fertile

790
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,600
right at this point you don't know what

791
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,599
the [ __ ] you got money invested in I

792
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,480
know a lot most people are probably just

793
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,480
gonna send it right but like have you

794
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,880
ever experienced where you had to throw

795
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,319
it all away I mean maybe you're not

796
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,919
throwing away you're keeping it for

797
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,439
yourself and running it and just

798
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,559
checking and just see if you pick up

799
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,919
traits you know I guess and then at that

800
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,398
point you just carry it further to work

801
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,799
it or what would you do what do you how

802
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:01,638
do you handle that kind of stuff um you

803
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:03,960
know like I experienced that with the

804
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:06,319
[ __ ] Aussie bastard that little some

805
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,880
[ __ ] stuck in and it's so obvious

806
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,319
because those leaves are so obvious and

807
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,600
if it it's in the first round you know

808
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,398
it was from a Herm essentially because

809
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,519
it wouldn't show up if it was from the

810
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:19,798
uh you know I mean it's only if it was a

811
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,919
male um yeah those I just kind of pretty

812
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:24,839
much gave away or put on deep sale like

813
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,600
$20 a pack and let people know hey there

814
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,079
is pollen contamination that's about the

815
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,519
best you can do a [ __ ] like that or or

816
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,199
toss it one or the other um I would

817
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,759
imagine most people that make seeds

818
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,399
would just send it out because you know

819
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,119
you're going to get unless it's a

820
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:42,239
totally different line it'll be super

821
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,638
obvious which I've seen many times um

822
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,679
where those plants like a Girl Scout

823
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:48,199
cookies will end up in a pollination of

824
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,159
you know Bubba cross to OG or that's

825
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
kind of bad um like Bubba and blueberry

826
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,399
and all of a sudden you see some Girl

827
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,960
Scout cookies popping up you know

828
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:57,518
someone had a Girl Scout cookies Herman

829
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,519
there and just let it go you know but um

830
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,319
yeah ideally you'd hope they wouldn't

831
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,200
and that they would make it known but

832
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:06,038
that's not always what we see right yeah

833
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,038
I mean I goes both ways I guess I guess

834
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:11,319
from a new uh breeders perspective on

835
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,440
you know trying to get into the game or

836
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:15,000
whatever you want to call it the

837
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,278
industry you know if you it is your

838
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,079
ideally you've kind of built up to this

839
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,319
point but my I was just thinking yeah

840
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,240
like what if you are new and you are

841
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,000
trying to get into it and you do have a

842
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,079
a [ __ ] up how do you handle that you

843
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,519
know I guess maybe like you said just be

844
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,599
transparent as possible and let people

845
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,880
let them [ __ ] know what's up because

846
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:33,839
some of us are going to see that [ __ ]

847
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,880
and we're going to know we're gonna go

848
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:39,038
we know what that [ __ ] is you know bro I

849
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,240
I come from the game I'm just trying to

850
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:44,599
figure out how it works no uh I'm

851
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,519
smoking dude I got some of this Irene S1

852
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:50,199
from uh CSI bro I'm smoking it's [ __ ]

853
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,880
nice bro it's not like the craziest

854
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,120
potency in the world or nothing but the

855
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,080
turs everything are on point bro Irene's

856
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:01,678
nice it's a very nice Cut Great gu I

857
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:06,398
like it uh another

858
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,960
olds oh yeah yeah he says is a is SDS or

859
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,358
colloidal silver better for creating

860
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,240
reversals I don't use colloidal silver

861
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:18,679
that's an old technique um I don't know

862
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,039
anybody who uses it effectively for um

863
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,918
yeah I just don't know anybody who uses

864
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:23,719
Cal silver anymore it was an old

865
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,440
technique on the forums people would

866
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,719
talk about mostly um there's been

867
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,838
science papers where they use STS and

868
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,039
put it against clal silver it's found to

869
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,918
not be as effective and so we just went

870
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,800
straight for STDs with my spray which

871
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:39,519
you can find on sale right now on

872
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:44,560
riot.com I was gonna plug Ito boom you

873
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:46,000
see that yeah that's good bro yep um

874
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,398
there I'm assuming there's other stuff

875
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,800
people have used in in the past too and

876
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:53,319
maybe even currently uh to to maybe

877
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,399
cause the reverse reversal is there

878
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,160
anything else you could kind of talk

879
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:01,039
about yeah um um um um um cobalt

880
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,159
chloride is another one um that's been

881
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,320
used by

882
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,960
Hyde um yeah I guess that's a secret I

883
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,838
don't [ __ ] it know um yeah cobal

884
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,400
chloride are using just silver without

885
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:16,400
the th without the Tho sufate th sulfate

886
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,760
helps a lot with um what's it called

887
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,920
light toxicity I'll just say that

888
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,440
because I'm not gonna [ __ ] use a big

889
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,000
word right here um yeah cool yeah the

890
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,920
Cobalt chlorid is another good one hell

891
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,599
yeah burn the [ __ ] out your plants

892
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,639
though so if you need a plant there's

893
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,720
some plants like like TK that you almost

894
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,118
have to kill to reverse to get it to

895
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,519
drop pollen um whereas a lot of other

896
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,039
plants you want them at Peak health and

897
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:44,000
don't want them to be burned so yeah his

898
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,719
is in Chlor yeah no his his Cobalt green

899
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,838
Cobalt green if I remember correctly

900
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,919
that's what we ended up uh running with

901
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:53,599
but yeah cobalt chloride is another one

902
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,760
that you can use I just buy my mat Riot

903
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,079
spray and I'm done dude done done Farm

908
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:16,920
Dragon he says or they say she says

909
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:20,199
whatever thems maybe I don't know hell

910
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,159
uh did you ever get any of those Alaskan

911

blueberry Rob mention in the video and

912
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,799
if so are you planning on breeding with

913
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,559
them I didn't

914
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,480
I don't know that Rob still has access

915
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,239
to that but we have um there's another

916
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,400
cut that's made it back in the circle

917
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,559
that's the Dabney blueberry that I

918
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,079
really want to work with again cool hey

919
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,239
do you ever sit on a [ __ ] bro and

920
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,800
you're just sitting there thinking I

921
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:45,159
know you you've been talking about

922
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,240
moving on from maybe a blueberry lines

923
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,159
and stuff a little bit but do you ever

924
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,039
sit on the [ __ ] or and you're

925
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,679
thinking like what if there is one more

926
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,079
out there that I didn't know I didn't

927
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,440
get to try or one more out there maybe I

928
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,400
can constantly constantly constantly

929
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,639
dude constantly

930
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,838
hey I mean that's cool dude I I I I

931
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,920
appreciate that you so into blueberry

932
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:06,519
lines that we have to have somebody that

933
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,240
is you know what I'm saying because if

934
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:11,280
it was like you gotta carry the torch

935
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:14,559
bro I think it's cool DJ Short you know

936
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,839
kind of he brought the the blueberry to

937
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,719
the table I think there might have been

938
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,920
other blueberries before him right um

939
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,519
but there for a lot of people including

940
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,680
myself there was a lot of disappointment

941
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:26,719
in buying a really expensive pack of

942
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,159
seeds called blueberry to not find one

943
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:34,439
thing that was blue blueberry like T

944
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:36,039
twise or taste um yeah I mean you know

945
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,920
like I I think most people had that

946
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:40,639
experience um but then there was some

947
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,800
great BC blueberries um from the BC era

948
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:46,440
guys working with blue

949
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,119
um yeah I don't know I mean I've crossed

950
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,760
it to a lot of stuff but like I could

951
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,880
always run more of each of the things

952
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,520
that I've crossed it to and there's a

953
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,039
few more that I'd like to go through I

954
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,920
just found another pack of poodle nuts

955
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,239
today which is I thought i' had given

956
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,000
the very last of those to um

957
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,719
little Hill and he popped him and he was

958
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,079
stoked on it and I was like oh [ __ ] that

959
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,239
does look amazing he's like yeah this is

960
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,560
the best out of the poodle nuts but I

961
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,279
didn't save any Cuts so now I'm like oh

962
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,039
[ __ ] but I did find I found the very

963
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,400
last pack so I'm like I think it's the

964
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:15,719
last pack who [ __ ] knows but um yeah

965
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,559
you got like that's how I am dude I find

966
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:19,719
like random packs just like that I

967
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:22,400
thought I didn't have any more of or or

968
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:24,199
whatever I I dude something I wanted to

969
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,119
before I forget I'm [ __ ] scatter

970
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,879
brain right now bro uh something is cool

971
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,838
we talking about earlier about clones

972
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,920
and [ __ ] and it made me think like why

973
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,880
the [ __ ] what uncertain stuff especially

974
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,639
uh you know trying your ex out it made

975
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,480
me realize like man I don't need no cut

976
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,159
of this when I could just have it in a

977
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,240
regular form bro a regular SE form it's

978
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:48,519
so cool like that I only popped the one

979
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,078
pack and every female that I I got was

980
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,639
some form of blue or blueberry or or

981
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:57,280
blueberry jam or blueberry candy or some

982
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,719
kind of mix of that and uh like like I

983
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,720
said said the other day going like two

984
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,759
months in bro and it still smells just

985
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:05,679
like the blueberry bro it smells great I

986
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,440
got them in the jar right here bro

987
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,679
that's awesome yeah I mean the idea with

988
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,000
the the incross line was

989
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:16,639
consistency um to have consistency in a

990
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,239
in a seed pop like ideally I think even

991
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,000
as new seed buyers we think you know

992
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,399
we're going to go buy a pack of seeds it

993
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,079
says it's like this specific thing they

994
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,039
always say oh yeah it's exactly like

995
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,440
this we pop those seeds and we don't get

996
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:31,960
that I mean that's pretty you know uh

997
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,000
and yeah like that as a seed buyer from

998
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,599
when I started to now the goal has

999
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,199
always been consistency being able to

1000
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,359
say it's like this high is gonna be like

1001
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,199
this for me I don't know if it'd be like

1002
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:45,078
that for everyone else but the turps are

1003
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,879
like XYZ you know it looks like XYZ and

1004
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:49,240
uh being able to provide that was uh

1005
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,640
very important so yeah yeah that was the

1006
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:52,959
most important thing I could have done

1007
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,480
in my career was make something

1008
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,480
consistent several years they really are

1009
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,880
too even the way they grow and I had a

1010
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,039
question for you about them bro yeah did

1011
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,680
they did you ever at one point I mean

1012
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,400
you're breeding them for consistency

1013
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,759
right and a lot of these a lot of them

1014
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,079
you're working with our shorter plants

1015
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,040
but did do you ever see a tall blueberry

1016
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,560
ex or any kind of blueberry that will

1017
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,920
run a little bit taller because like all

1018
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,639
the ones I had no they perform like what

1019
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,838
they're supposed to you know short and

1020
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,239
more of a squat squat Afghan dominant

1021
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,279
types for the most part yeah yeah and

1022
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,879
and the the CH profile was stuck in that

1023
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,280
like you would you really weren't

1024
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,119
finding that that shirt profile at least

1025
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,839
in in the in Cross lines and the Bonnet

1026
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,358
you weren't finding any of these Broad

1027
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:37,480
Leaf types or um narrow Leaf types

1028
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,480
shooting out huge blueberry turbs you

1029
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,000
know I did make one cross with a blue

1030
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,280
satellite that kind of took it in that

1031
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,239
direction more narrow Leaf bigger Cola

1032
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,079
taller lankier but um for the most part

1033
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:53,039
yeah it's it's it's kept in the

1034
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,440
Afghan that's cool yeah that's cool bro

1035
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,800
I really enjoy growing man easy grow

1036
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,679
pretty quick flower everything man

1037
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,359
I got I made seeds with them I want to

1038
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,960
run some and find you know a better

1039
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,559
expression bro that's the main thing and

1040
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,358
you're bringing out the blue when you

1041
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:11,239
when you outcross it because it's a true

1042
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:13,759
be a true breeding line in that sense so

1043
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,719
yeah that's [ __ ] awesome more more

1044
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,359
more have you have you figured out where

1045
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,000
you're going I know I ask you this every

1046
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:23,039
week bro but have you figured out which

1047
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
direction you gonna go next I'm biting

1048
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:29,199
it a bit to know bro I mean you know

1049
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,880
like I wanted to do more gel work right

1050
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,679
but me and CSI did some of that in fem

1051
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,480
lines and he he crossed it to more [ __ ]

1052
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,159
than I could have ever imagined right um

1053
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,119
the strawberry stuff I got rid of most

1054
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,719
of my strawberry stuff so trying to go

1055
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,318
back and rework my strawberry stuff I

1056
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,399
don't have much of the strawberry stuff

1057
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:49,239
anymore I've kind of passed it on um the

1058
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,880
p91 stuff I passed on to other people

1059
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:52,799
who are doing work with the p91 stuff

1060
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,119
now it's and people seem to dig it and

1061
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,200
that's rad but um yeah I don't quite

1062
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,079
know what I would do next like I really

1063
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,960
need to sit down with my big [ __ ] bag

1064
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,560
of collection stuff and like the only

1065
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,720
thing that really appeals to me like

1066
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:09,078
there's the Maduro which was an Oregan

1067
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:14,000
purple thae line which is just more

1068
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:15,800
blueberry parentage kind of um [ __ ] I

1069
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,838
don't I don't really know I don't want

1070
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,760
to do more

1071
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:21,199
sour I don't want to do more Super Skunk

1072
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,559
stuff because I think I've done all I

1073
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,879
can do with super skunk um it's hard to

1074
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,480
say I've got to do fem workor though

1075
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,880
because that's all it sells anymore so

1076
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,440
yeah so I mean going back and being

1077
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,440
redundant on blueberry and doing like a

1078
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,358
feminized blue incross now that would

1079
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,920
bring out so many recessives and mutants

1080
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:41,519
that I'm not sure that's even a good

1081
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,599
idea like it in theory it sounds great

1082
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:47,400
but yeah I don't know how it would uh

1083
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,079
present speaking on that Maduro I ran

1084
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:55,200
those uh I think it was I always forget

1085
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:59,559
the name bro it's [ __ ] was it black

1086
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:02,159
cherry black cherry Maduro White Rhino

1087
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,920
to anyways I ran those out I just called

1088
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,558
it the Maduro just because it was easy I

1089
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,159
ha I [ __ ] can barely read them right

1090
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:10,880
bro you know anyways I I yeah ended up

1091
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:12,799
with two females out of like the six

1092
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,400
seeds the real old seeds you sent out

1093
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,119
with the patron [ __ ] I popped them bro I

1094
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,960
got two females out of them uh the one

1095
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,880
was just a little I don't know she just

1096
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,440
was kind of didn't really I ended up

1097
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,119
chopping her so I ran the one and when I

1098
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,838
first tried it dude I was like this is

1099
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,480
all right bro and it's that classic case

1100
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:31,679
of like I let it cure for like a month

1101
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,280
and I had smoked other [ __ ] I was

1102
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,199
smoking the skank dog and all the other

1103
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,200
stuff and I go back and smoke it bro and

1104
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,558
it was [ __ ] pretty nice dude like

1105
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,838
yeah I can't at the end of the day I

1106
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:43,480
threw it away so it sucks but I ended up

1107
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:44,960
growing them out dude and were nice but

1108
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,039
I didn't get a mail so I was just like

1109
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,880
[ __ ] I I just ended up chucking it bro

1110
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,318
there's a lot in that parentage of those

1111
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,119
seeds which is the only reason I never

1112
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:57,318
ran them like I want to just find the

1113
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,318
Maduro stuff like that that was already

1114
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:00,960
a special line now the the Maduro stuff

1115
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:04,920
if I remember came from the same dudes

1116
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,159
that the the rose Flow came from and um

1117
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,639
yeah is it alkaline man or elevator man

1118

1191
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:19,199
crosswise or it's been crossed into it

1192
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,800
bro every pack that every plant in there

1193
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,639
is pretty good of some you know it might

1194
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,640
be not maybe one don't have a stru the

1195
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,598
right structure whatever but the actual

1196
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:30,159
smoke the flavor the turbs anything with

1197
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:32,599
p smoke comes out pretty good bro like

1198

1252
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:56,000
of these questions here oh we got you go

1253
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:57,358
got a couple more here if you uh as Sean

1254
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,480
says

1255
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,519
if you could go back to one line you

1256
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,079
made and start a new project from it

1257
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,960
what would it be the strawberry switch

1258
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,119
blade that would be it it was a I you

1259
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,838
know what to be honest I can't even

1260
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,400
remember what was in that son of a [ __ ]

1261
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:14,039
it was East Coast s diesel strawberry

1262
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,838
cream and I think it was the double

1263
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,279
black DOA which was also a poly hybrid

1264
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:22,679
but it just made for this really uh

1265
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,319
magenta looking very strawberry scented

1266
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:29,519
Afghani type plant it's gorgeous

1267
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:32,159
consistent and super strawberry yeah

1268
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,280
that would probably be one for

1269
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,239
sure I don't know I had a this this goes

1270
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,680
to jab question was my favorite Bubba

1271
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:43,039
hybrid I've ever smoked there was

1272
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:45,239
a um a Bubba hybrid with killer queen

1273
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,798

1368
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,519
eventually I mean it's I still have more

1369
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:47,679
of the original Bonnet seats to pop

1370
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:51,759
though and go through so that always

1371
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:53,639
interests me um yeah that's cool man uh

1372
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,920
and then his other question was oh you

1373
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:56,558
answered both of them my bad yeah I mean

1374
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,720
just slow down the Cure bro I mean as

1375
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,400
far as like bringing out the blue turps

1376
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,959
I mean you see the blue turps even on

1377
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,400
crosses I mean I think it was at the I

1378
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,039
mean of course it's called the Blue hype

1379
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,400
the great blue hype had it in there and

1380
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:12,759
you see now after growing uh thex you

1381
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,838
can find really great blue turts in

1382
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,839
almost any of Matt's work that had you

1383
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:18,318
know that has the Bonnet in it it's not

1384
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:21,440
too far from

1385
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:24,279
thex I mean it's [ __ ] pretty spot on

1386

1388
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:34,959

1389
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:36,759
ran through all of our questions guys

1390
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,199
all of them all of them done are we done

1391
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,640
I think so is this [ __ ] [ __ ] let me

1392
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,598
double check I want make sure we're

1393
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,639

1394
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,440
showing love to everybody oh we got one

1395
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:52,558
more good one a fresh one heirloom

1396
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,559
Afghan remake feminized

1397
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,479
afghanis yeah I don't know like it had

1398
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,039
its long round and then people got mad

1399
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,358
because it I didn't make a lot of them

1400
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,240
and I sold them for a lot because

1401
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:09,078
everybody wanted them so I don't

1402
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:11,759
know I don't know I I don't know maybe I

1403
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:13,240
have some left could could do could do I

1404
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,200
really like the

1405
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:19,038
um I don't know crosses with it that I

1406
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:21,798
liked but yeah no I mean it's just a an

1407
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:25,480
old Super Skunk type so I think there's

1408
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:27,358
even better super skunks than that um it

1409
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,519
was skunky it was nice nice but yeah it

1410
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:31,279
was also highly variant which which

1411
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,798
isn't something I love I think that's my

1412
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,760
biggest um my biggest annoyance is

1413
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:43,679
variance in in lines uh poly

1414
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:45,359
hybrids yep I got a remember them Afghan

1415
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,239
90s we talked

1416
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:51,038
about yeah I got some of those going

1417
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:53,558
dude and uh couple of man when you rub

1418
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,480
the stems dude I know it's not always a

1419
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:58,319
tail sign of everything but they have

1420
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,679
really like kind of similar to the ex a

1421
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:01,719
bit but a little different more of a

1422
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,440
Sharp sharpness to the nose on it but

1423
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:06,159
that's this real like two of them had

1424
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,679
this like almost like blueberry kind of

1425
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,519
berry smells really interesting actually

1426
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:12,679
I haven't I haven't started flowering

1427
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:13,798
them or nothing yet but they're really

1428
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:16,118
interesting if I remember correctly it

1429
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:18,199

1490
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:51,960
rancid like coffee smell that it's uh

1491
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,839
yeah coffee skunky like not really like

1492
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,358

1495
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:03,440

1496
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:05,279
it's just really pungent like really

1497
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,880
nice on the and that's what you taste

1498
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,760
too that's what I like about it is you

1499
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,519
taste that you know how sometimes you

1500
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:14,160
put weed in a a blunt or joint or bong

1501
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:16,440
whatever and it doesn't taste like what

1502
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,239
you're smelling bro that that's what I

1503
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,679
like about this is it tastes tastes what

1504
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:24,239
I smell and I I don't

1505
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:27,118
know yeah for people asking about skunk

1506
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,879
six it was some people in Colorado had

1507
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,000
it as skunk 6 it was passed around as

1508
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,240
skunk 6 back then it is dead so if

1509
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,159
people are trying to sell seeds of it

1510
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:36,239
they're selling you a [ __ ] a myth and

1511
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:38,639
a

1512
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,519
dream it's been people have been doing

1513
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:43,639
that with [ __ ] mass mass Super Skunk

1514
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,639
that wasn't Mass Super Skunk for ever

1515
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:47,400
since I've been around and no one's

1516
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:50,440
produced it the VA Super Skunk we know

1517
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,639
what it looks like um the closest thing

1518
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,318
that was used with it would be sour you

1519
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,159
know sour was used with it and that's

1520
01:00:54,318 --> 01:01:00,759
where you're going to see the progy of

1521
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:03,719
any skunk 6 or uh VA Super Skunk AKA

1522
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,160
Mass Super Skunk number one and since it

1523
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:06,838
was the first one that they renamed a

1524
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:08,759
mass super skunk and later they popped

1525
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:12,358
sensey Super Skunk seeds called that

1526
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,559
mass Super Skunk 2 because why not um

1527
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:15,679
yeah they didn't call it number two they

1528
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:18,079
just called it Mass Super Skunk as well

1529
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:27,358
because that's how them cam Doggers do

1530
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:29,920
right hey Kim I do that's it mother no

1534
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:40,318

younger people in the space bro we need

1543
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:01,599

1564
01:02:52,559 --> 01:03:00,880
about Matt or or blueberry like fact is

1565
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:04,119
that no hold on goddamn it the fact is

1566
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,720
you're keystoned a corner piece of our

1567
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:08,278
community and the broader community in a

1568
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,159
lot of ways I think bro you brought so

1569
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:12,798
much if anything you bring everybody

1570
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,278
together and you give us you know like d

1571
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,400
and a couple other guys y'all bring us

1572
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:19,199
together and I think if we could just

1573
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,680
stop arguing about how important your

1574
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,519
color of your [ __ ] ashes bro and

1575
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:26,118
focus

1576
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:28,519
on important topics or whether I'm f one

1577
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,559
or smoking weed out of your [ __ ]

1578
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:33,239
butthole glass

1579
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,760
style uh let's you know we need to focus

1580
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:38,759
on the bigger issues bro yeah yeah I

1581
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,520
don't know I think that butthole glass

1582
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,278
style might be painful back back to my

1583
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,239
question what are we what are we working

1584
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:46,119
with in the future we gotta get

1585
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:47,439
something you gotta come up with

1586

1645
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:06,440
horns he says I have a question I'm

1646
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:09,318
interested in preserving Big Bang slash

1647
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:13,440
making a strain out of it I have a big

1648
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:15,599
bang times diesel as an S1 clone what

1649
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,519
would you use to breed it back to Big

1650
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,920
Bang and then it's got skunk number one

1651
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:22,639
ll1

1652
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,119
nl1 and then El

1653
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:27,598
Nino there is never a day I would try to

1654
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:30,920
preserve a Greenhouse seed

1655
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:34,519
string you don't believe in

1656
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,519
aan what

1657
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:42,039
a no I don't mean to be a dick yeah me

1658
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:44,159
and my for my liking there's nothing I

1659
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:47,039
would buy from greenhouse seeds because

1660
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:48,519
they sold many things as big bang so

1661
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:52,240
what you're getting it's not necessarily

1662
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:55,199
skunk one nl1 and El Nino um it may have

1663
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:57,078
been skunk one nl1 hay it could have

1664
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:01,000
been any number of things that was sold

1665
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:02,798
as big bang because they would buy from

1666
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,920
places like Buddha seeds not big Buddha

1667
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:08,400
seeds Buddha seeds Spain and buy bulk

1668
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,559
and use that for whatever lines they had

1669
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,000
and just be like these [ __ ] won't

1670
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,640
know so there's no point in um

1671
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
preserving stuff that you don't know

1672
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:18,920
what it is unless you really really like

1673
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,880
it for yourself as far as preserving a

1674
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:23,519
strain for like the

1675
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,400
future that's one of those those tough

1676
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,480
ones um it's a tough one

1677
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,880
y I mean if you it comes back to if you

1678
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,559
like it keep it yeah yeah um as far as

1679
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,079
preserving it for the future you'd be

1680
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:36,920
preserving something that we just don't

1681
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:39,318
know what it

1682
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,000
is yeah that's that's the thing when

1689
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:52,519
