region

23
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
he always ignores him huh that's why i

24
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,319
gotta keep doing him

25
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,239

26
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,798
laughing what's up curbside how you

27

31
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,519
boxes after box after box after box

32
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,560
after box

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
so hopefully it'll be um

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
hopefully

35
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:23,119
it'll be up soon

36
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,598
i don't know about lazy where is he

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,599
there he is

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,878
technical difficulties testicle

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
difficulties over there something

40
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,039
alright actually

41
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,120
when you first started the video i was

42
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,079
like what if we did a whole live like

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,439
this

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
like that that'd be something that's how

45
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,519
you were like it was like the very top

46
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,439
of your head and like two eyes popping

47
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
out i could do it like this you just see

48
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,359
my [ __ ] wrinkles

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,878
hmm yeah i try to keep

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
it's hard too because i can't really

51
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,959
like wear my glasses and focus on

52
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,800
something this close yeah i can't even

53
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,840
but it makes it hard to like read

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,599
comments

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,800
yeah i try to wear glasses to read the

56
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,518
comments because that's what they're for

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,599
but it doesn't really help much anymore

58
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,560
it just [ __ ] me up i can't like see far

59
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,079
and super close at the same time yeah i

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,400
don't know what it is

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,239
so and then yeah i tried to join the

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,319
live but i think matt wanted to get his

63
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
bejazzling talk out of the way i did i

64
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,238
did i wanted to let them know that

65
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,639
without he wanted that as a monologue

66
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,878
where i didn't have any chance to object

67
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
or change the subject so

68
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,399
uh that was all that was all it was

69
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,399
either technical difficulties or

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
intentional on matt's part yeah i don't

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
know what it was um but yeah i know i

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
mean i was just talking about your new

73
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,399
hobby the the where you put your gems

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
and you just get nice adhesive and stick

75
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
it real hard and take pictures it was

76
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,359
[ __ ] it's pretty cool

77
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,878
i mean the people that can make a living

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,920
doing that

79
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,919
you know

80
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,238
i mean i got to make a living somehow

81
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,000
you know i would i you know i mean they

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
probably played they probably paid marky

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,318
mark a lot to pose on those calvin

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,640
kleins right yeah i would think so you

85
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,560
know okay so you would imagine so

86
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,719
yeah he's not packing heat like i am

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
though that's for sure no i mean i think

88
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,359
there was an unripe avocado involved or

89
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,639
something like that so it's all that's

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,959
for our leaf avocado colored

91
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,159
that's for artistic impressions

92
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,759
all right so what did we want to cover

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
today where do you want to start

94
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,079
uh well we we thought about it i did

95
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,679
that

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,840
we thought about uh

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
we thought about putting out like a few

98
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,719
different things people were requesting

99
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,879
certain stuff so

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
uh we'll pay attention to comments if we

101
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,478
can and we'll take questions and then

102
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,040
people were asking

103
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,199
about like uh because it's it's like a

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,199
big name like what what's some of the

105
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,478
super dog which i'm kind of tied into

106
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,160
story is about

107
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,360
and then what some of the kush story is

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,120
about yeah and it's like not to be we

109
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
probably won't get like massively in

110
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
depth in some kind of step by step

111
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,638
because there's a lot of

112
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,280
uh i don't know what would you do a lot

113
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,280
of toes to step on a lot of people with

114
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,918
money tied to their story about oj kush

115
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,000
so yeah but so so there's there's some

116
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,918
legends and there's competing tales and

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,800
there's stories that you kind of have to

118
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,959
choose who to believe again yeah um it's

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,319
it's one of the more complicated ones

120
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,079
and uh

121
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,319
but we can talk about like how it

122
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,079
impacted california which is kind of

123
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,279
really where it got famous

124
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,599
yeah you know

125
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,478
and uh you know kush

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
uh

127
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:28,639
i wow that's an interesting one i did

128
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,360
know chris oh yeah he has been uh he's

129
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,960
been missing for a super long time uh

130
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,240
his and his family still pays like

131
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,279
there's like hundreds of thousands of

132
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,079
dollars

133
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,038
yeah

134
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,560
i mean it's

135
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,680
one of those it's one of those things

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,439
that uh

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,360
someone asked weeks ago to do some

138
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,600
missing person stories or whatever and

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,360
it's like yeah there's people have

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,560
families and friends and loved ones and

141
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
stuff and

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,478
all that so yeah

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
it's probably not the most like

144
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,318
the coolest thing to chat about you know

145
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,639
the sensitive nature of that i'm sure

146
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,000
yeah kids and stuff left behind well no

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,680
i mean it's just more like you know

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
people you know it's like someone goes

149
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,879
missing you got friends and family that

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
love yeah yeah for sure and they don't

151
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,560
have any and and the reason why there's

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
a huge reward is they don't have closure

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,800
yeah yeah it's pretty horrible you know

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,319
and so that kind of stuff that kind of

155
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,600
stuff happens up here

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,960
yeah you know it's isolated and so yeah

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,080
i don't know but did you catch the

158
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,560
obsolete um posting pictures of hlv

159
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,198
infected seeds

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,199
you know i didn't but

161
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,720
uh you know i was actually strangely

162
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,319
enough we could talk about that for a

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
second because

164
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
uh it was probably two nights ago or

165
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,960
something i had a pretty long chat with

166
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,079
uh uh csi yeah and we were talking about

167
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,399
a bunch of different things and one of

168
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,240
the things that it's interesting is you

169
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,359
know as you know he's got a couple of

170
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,800
plants

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,240
uh that have dudding yeah right that are

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,919
just really old

173
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,160
and irreplaceable

174
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,918
yeah and so he keeps them but he keeps

175
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,479
them in a totally separate spot and all

176
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,519
that yeah right well anyway one of them

177
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,680
is uh one of them is calio yeah right

178
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,680
and so there's this rumor you know i

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,879
don't know if it's a rumor but there's a

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,160
there's uh tails going around that the

181
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,120
viroid uh duding viroid hl whatever the

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,280
[ __ ] you call it hplv or whatever yeah

183
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
past not only does it stay alive in

184
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,839
plants but it passes on to a certain

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
percentage of seed yeah it's i think the

186
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,879
the number is

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,280
from the hops people it was eight

188
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,319
percent of seeds it can be passed to but

189
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,359
that doesn't necessarily what people

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,720
don't understand is that doesn't

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
necessarily mean that eight percent of

192
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
your seeds that you pop are gonna

193
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,199
absolutely show it i mean

194
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
that it gives it eight percent chance

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
and it could be eight percent of the

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,360
seeds you didn't pop that you had you

197
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,680
know oh yeah i mean chances is like so

198
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,598
over a huge number of seeds

199
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,079
you're you know all things being equal

200
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:53,199
your seeds somewhere between like 50 50

201
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,198
male female or 60 40 yeah right over

202
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,639
over like a large lot like on a big

203
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,879
average but i mean i've popped like 26

204
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,598
seeds two packs of like mangoes haze and

205
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,599
got three girls yeah

206
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,478
yeah i have the same same stuff where

207
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,240
you get like zero females all males yeah

208
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,560
or vice versa you know the law of

209
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,120
averages on like a very small amount is

210
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,519
not that great but i will say the point

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,160
before i get to too distracted is

212
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,959
he grew out some of those hybrids

213
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,439
yeah

214
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,598
uh and he didn't see any he didn't he

215
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,160
didn't find any evidence of it yet

216
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,839
yes that's correct so i don't know i

217
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,759
don't know that

218
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,918
that's i don't want to say true but i

219
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,360
don't know how proven that is yeah i

220
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,199
don't know how proven that that eight

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,278
percent is and is that just hops is it

222
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,560
not necessarily cannabis which is a hops

223
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,679
you know relation

224
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,918
um

225
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,319
there's not enough science on it yet on

226
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,799
uh as it relates to just cannabis

227
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
yeah no one no one looks cool smoking

228
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,439
their vape so i try to hide it sometimes

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
sorry guys

230
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,200
yeah no no one looks cool

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,039
it is interesting um because

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
you know there's an aspect

233
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,919
him and i were also chatting about which

234
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,519
is like

235
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,559
there was an era where you didn't really

236
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,720
worry about uh disease or bugs too much

237
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
right powdery mildew was unheard of

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
there was no dudding there was anything

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,799
like that and there was this thing where

240
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,560
most people either

241
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,039
did their own clothes

242
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,518
yeah or only supplied their small little

243
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,439
tiny group of friends yeah right and so

244
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,120
a lot of times diseases or issues or

245
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,440
something like that were fairly

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,839
localized and didn't really you never

247
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,120
really heard about them to be honest

248
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,279
and then in like the 215 era uh when

249
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,399
people when lots of clubs started

250
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:42,000
selling racks of cuttings for like uh

251
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,000
for profit yeah a lot of people stopped

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,839
running their own veggies

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,759
stopped the cake taking care of their

254
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,360
own mother stock and their own clones

255
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,838
and everything like that yeah and just

256
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
decided [ __ ] that power in space i'm

257
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,399
just going to buy

258
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,959
clones

259
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,559
yeah for my next rip from you know my

260
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,679
friend at this shop

261
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,159
yeah

262
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,399
at smart cart yeah

263
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,519
yeah and you know and and certain

264
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,679
companies

265
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,639
you know and so that so in a way it's

266
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,278
like

267
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,480
those diseases made their way to like

268
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,320
certain like

269
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,560
nurseries and clearing houses that were

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
supplying a lot of clubs

271
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,599
yeah and they spread it all over and

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
they spread it to thousands of different

273
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,959
gardens yeah

274
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,079
and so then it kind of became this thing

275
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,000
where now

276
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,239
you see it on ig and all this there's

277
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,559
advertisements for viroid tests like

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,320
crazy yeah people are taking all kinds

279
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,359
of precautions we've had buddies that it

280
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
came in

281
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
and uh ripped through their rooms

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,958
um

283
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,039
there seems to be different different

284
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,599
strengths and different ones

285
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,278
uh most people don't understand uh what

286
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,360
a viroid even is

287
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,679
i think we've all everyone in our crew

288
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,519
has at least seen one dud over time to

289
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,679
be able to experience what that was and

290
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,679
now we all kind of [ __ ] know it sucks

291
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,639
yeah but i mean there was even a thing

292
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,319
where i was listening to a different and

293
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,480
an excerpt from a different podcast and

294
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,000
they were interviewing someone who uh

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
scientifically studied it right and they

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,958
were talking about the different methods

297
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
um because it's a it's not even a virus

298
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,319
it's a viroid it's like little bits of

299
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,078
rna or whatever yeah uh and it's like

300
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,839
for the most part it's like it's totally

301
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,919
fine and 99

302
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
isopropyl yeah

303
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,559
it's it doesn't kill it

304
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,919
yeah uh you know we've been i some a

305
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,078
couple of good friends of ours they had

306
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,439
some tech at their nurseries where they

307
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,519
had like the

308
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,839
the uh propane canister and the torch

309
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,159
that attaches to it yeah and they would

310
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,640
torch their their you know their

311
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,559
equipment plant to plant yep that

312
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,039
doesn't kill it no

313
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,278
you know [ __ ] i mean root to like like

314
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,879
what i saw was root uh like if they're

315
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,039
if you have a tray of clones and you've

316
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,720
taken all these different strains some

317
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,639
are more susceptible to catching it by

318
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,480
the roots and the water or it's the

319
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,159
[ __ ] razor blade or whatever you're

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,759
doing it spreads pretty [ __ ] bad

321
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,039
and so and so then there's an aspect

322
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,480
where it's like basically what they

323
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,639
found is that like

324
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,639
you know 10 or 15 percent bleach for 10

325
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,159
minutes does kill it

326
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,919
really yeah

327
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,919
but like uh uh h2o2 hydrogen peroxide

328
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,838
the strong [ __ ] yeah that doesn't kill

329
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,879
it alcohol doesn't kill it fire doesn't

330
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
kill it

331
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,399
uh there's something about the chemical

332
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,200
composition of uh

333
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,720
of bleach i wonder if the vine oxide

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,639
works there's this other stuff uh yeah

335
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,879
there's a few other things that that

336
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,120
cause that kill it but some of those

337
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,480
things are like really harsh on tools

338
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,159
yeah or you

339
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,240
you know so

340
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,879
uh but then the interesting thing about

341
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,519
bleach is if you buy like store bleach

342
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,399
uh yeah uh uh our buddies skunk just

343
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,639
said vicrons um if you buy if you buy

344
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,278
like uh clothing bleach

345
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,839
like sodium hypochloride that stuff only

346
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,000
stays good once you mix it for like i

347
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,040
don't know five to eight hours yeah and

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,919
then if it gets too dirty it goes inert

349
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,759
yeah

350
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,679
i remember like jungle boys jungle boys

351
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,159
was saying they were using i don't want

352
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,719
to get it wrong but it was um something

353
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,199
like sanidate or oxidate yeah it was

354
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
like one from that company xerox hall or

355
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,600
i remember yeah zero tall i remember i

356
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,120
spilled that [ __ ] pure on my [ __ ] leg

357
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,440
once oh

358
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,440
[ __ ] yeah

359
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,559
but you know for people now that we've

360
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,880
gone this far into it or whatever but

361
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,879
if you want to use a bleach solution

362
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,039
that stays a lot more lasting and

363
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,519
doesn't get [ __ ] up super fast like

364
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,519
your laundry bleach yeah uh get bleach

365
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,360
for pools

366
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,440
because that way that's calcium

367
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,079
hypochlorite

368
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,320
right and calcium hypochlorite is you

369
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,000
know pools are dirty you know they get

370
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
[ __ ] in them and stuff like that like as

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,078
far as you know dirt and leaves and

372
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,879
whatnot so it doesn't go inert the same

373
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,638
way sodium hypochlorite does yeah

374
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,000
but now people i mean i go i go to the

375
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,839
store and i buy

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,240
uh you know like a hundred pack of of

377
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,639
blades yeah and i just i i just add you

378
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,879
know yep every plant gets a new every

379
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,600
plant gets a new blade yeah it's a good

380
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,720
habit to make and you you know you uh

381
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,320
yeah and so

382
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,879
there's an act there's aspect to it

383
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,959
where it's like so what sucks is that

384
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,559
you know you go somewhere and you see

385
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,679
some really cool tech that somebody's

386
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,239
doing and you're like oh i'm going to

387
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,679
incorporate that into my own thing

388
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,000
and then you find out that it actually

389
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,838
doesn't work yeah

390
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,399
yeah yeah i tried with i tried with the

391
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,639
sanitate and oxidate on the

392
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,759
four-way and trinity cut because both of

393
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,680
those have the hlv and

394
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,679
not no dice hey natto

395
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,839
yes

396
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,639
i just want to wish you a happy pride

397
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,240
indeed

398
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,240
happy breakfast

399
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,600
that right there before i lose it

400
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,320
because it'll go off my screen every

401
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,399
plant gets its own rooting hormone yeah

402
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,120
taking all the precautions to actually

403
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,759
like

404
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,639
separate and not cross-contaminate

405
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,480
um it's a pain in the ass yeah it is and

406
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
it's basically like dipping in

407
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,920
you having a separate like thing a

408
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
clonex for every [ __ ] thing or

409
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,278
whatever yeah and then on top of that

410
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,799
then you're then you got to use rockwool

411
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,039
or you got to use the earth plugs or

412
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,198
something like an easy cloner yeah it's

413
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,879
like that's everywhere yeah that's if

414
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,198
you're done at that yeah that's like

415
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,198
making out with people with the flu yeah

416
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,120
you know and uh

417
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,639
you know and and so it's hard because

418
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,360
there's like real science and bro

419
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
science yes and for a long time we only

420
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,600
had bro science because real science

421
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,759
couldn't touch wheat i i can't tell you

422
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,920
how long i have heard that powdery

423
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,600
mildew plastic passes to seedlings like

424
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,958
that's bro science it's been bro science

425
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,959
for a long time so when i first heard

426
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,239
about the hlv thing i was very skeptical

427
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,758
you know because i'd seen a lot of

428
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,759
people breed with duds over the years

429
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,079
and never seen the duds pop up in seed

430
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,680
porn but apparently the hops people do

431
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,599
say it happen so

432
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,919
yeah and i mean that that obviously

433
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
still has to be checked and and proven

434
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,599
over time and that's how science is

435
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,559
right is it like it's the best

436
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,320
information you have and and you know

437
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,399
we'll we'll see i don't know where that

438
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,240
originates from yeah i know that's

439
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,639
stupidity i think uh you know

440
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,159
and uh well you know it

441
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,639
people to have to understand the life

442
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,519
cycle of things and like a viroid isn't

443
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,639
even a virus it's like little bits of

444
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,879
rna

445
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,720
yeah and so to have something so small

446
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,720
like that be able to just [ __ ] us up so

447
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
hard the skunk van knows i don't even

448
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
know what trans laminar means and i

449
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,480
probably should but i think that sounds

450
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,319
correct so translaminer

451
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,320
is there's two things right there's

452
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,160
vascular where it's moving through your

453
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,680
vascular system yeah yeah and then

454
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,799
there's translaminer which is

455
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,559
essentially like uh the the leaf surface

456
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,799
okay yeah that means right

457
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,239
so in some for for instance like to give

458
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,919
you an example of you could use a

459
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,320
certain kind of poison

460
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,000
yeah and it would be a contact killer or

461
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,879
maybe it would form a relationship and

462
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,959
be trans laminar and go on the leaf okay

463
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,558
and we're not systemic

464
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,400
that could be systemic though it could

465
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,798
it could have systemic translaminer and

466
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,798
you can have systemic vascular i know i

467
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,038
know systemic vascular but i never heard

468
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,318
i wouldn't think systemic would be just

469
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,318
leaf touching but i guess that makes

470
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,759
sense yeah you know well i mean it just

471
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,599
depends there's people humans have

472
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,000
figured out all kinds of different [ __ ]

473
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,599
yeah you know um but he's right in the

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,038
sense that pm is

475
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,319
you know it's like pm the hardest thing

476
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,798
is to break its life cycle yeah

477
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,678
you know um and that's what people don't

478
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,918
do

479
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,919
yeah you know they mostly break its life

480
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,520
cycle but then it like

481
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,038
you know i don't know i mean when you

482
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,319
live in mendo and you're surrounded by

483
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,400
vineyards and everything else and

484
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,200
everybody grows uh you know we got a

485
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,798
crash course 20 years ago in p.m

486
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,798
yeah you know i i wanted to make some

487
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,839
eagle 20 jokes but i can't even joke

488
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,160
about that [ __ ] anymore because people

489
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,798
take that [ __ ] soon yeah they said avid

490
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,759
is a uh avid is we used to call avid the

491
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,400
death

492
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,798
uh avid is a trans laminar yeah

493
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,360
systemic or whatever um

494
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,480
and you know 20 25 years ago someone is

495
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,439
systemic

496
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,519
yeah

497
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
because i last i i do remember that

498
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,119
spider mites are not susceptible to

499
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,439
things that are systemic because of how

500
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,279
deep they go into the leaf

501
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
no they're susceptible

502
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,918
i mean the issue the issue becomes

503
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,038
really with spider mites specifically

504
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,440
is that

505
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,079
20 25 30 years ago there was there's a

506
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,600
bunch of poisons for spider mites uh

507
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,678
that are you know all from pretty

508
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,199
natural to pretty toxic that worked

509
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,919
really well

510
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,840
and you know people overused these

511
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,919
toxins over and over and over again and

512
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,279
would dip their clones in it every time

513
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,280
and would just yeah they were trying to

514
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,519
take precautions

515
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,200
but what they bred was super mites yeah

516
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,879
i was pretty sure avid wasn't systemic

517
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,880
yeah it's one of the ones it's not um

518
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,400
just because it's not it's not systemic

519
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,840
doesn't work necessarily with spider

520
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
mites you don't need systemic so they

521
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,439
don't go that far so maybe people are

522
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,079
there's there's vascular systemic and

523
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,840
there's trans laminar

524
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,199
right and so

525
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,359
like when you think about it like if

526
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,279
something's a contact killer it means

527
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,079
that the bug has to come into contact to

528
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:13,678
kill it yeah right if there's something

529
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:16,240
that's trans laminar and like and uh um

530
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,160
and and persists within the leaf for a

531
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,160
period of time

532
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,919
it'll kill the bug for that length of

533
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,240
time that it persists if that's not

534
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,360
necessarily systemic if it stays in the

535
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,558
plant that's not a definition of

536
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,839
systemic

537
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,918
well i mean it's also one of those

538
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,558
things though that it's systemic in the

539
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,880
sense that uh your plant will test

540
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,279
positive for it for a long time

541
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,360
yeah yeah but i think there's something

542
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,079
specific about it not being systemic

543
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,319
like

544
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,159
what it what it actually is avid um yeah

545
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,079
i mean someone's amacloropid which is

546
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,480
the people used for root aphids or

547
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,079
whatever that stuff you can test like

548
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that stuff will test dirty one to two

549
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,839
years later yeah that's crazy [ __ ] so

550
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,200
that's kind of maybe i mean maybe i'm

551
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,079
getting it wrong what i consider to be

552
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,840
systemic yeah is that if you apply it

553
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,279
and then weeks or months later you can

554
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,279
still test for it

555
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,279
yeah it's around

556
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,918
it's in the plant system somehow whether

557
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,279
that's the leaf system or the the you

558
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
know and maybe we can look it up and

559
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,359
maybe i'm totally [ __ ] yeah i don't

560
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,038
know i don't know it's always possible

561
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,719
but that's kind of how i that's kind of

562
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,759
how i view things is like things that

563
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,600
persist yeah i don't i have no clue to

564
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,000
be honest with you i just remember that

565
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,279
that the the old saying that systemic

566
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,720
stuff doesn't work on mites because they

567
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,480
don't go deep enough into the leaf yeah

568
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,558
someone just asked if you spray avid and

569
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,120
veg it will absolutely

570
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,119
um it will absolutely persist for some

571
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,719
time yeah and there used to be 80 to 90

572
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,079
days is right i should say i should say

573
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
this thing there used to be this thing

574
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,558
where

575
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
not to call anybody out or anything like

576
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,399
that but there was a lot of people that

577
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,279
supplied clubs

578
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,919
that knew exactly how many weeks you had

579
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,158
to go not spraying it to test totally

580
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,240
clean at the club oh yeah

581
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,080
and so they would do this thing where

582
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
like this gentleman just just asked can

583
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,798
you spray it and veg they would spray

584
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
the [ __ ] and veg

585
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,359
yeah

586
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,879
and veg for x amount of weeks and then

587
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,959
bloom for x amount of weeks and then

588
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,799
know that it would be clean

589
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,600
and then in order to in order to get

590
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,480
around that yeah uh the legal testing it

591
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,879
went from ppm to ppb

592
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,200
oh oh yeah that's right from parts per

593
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,919
million to parts per billion

594
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
and once it went to parts per billion it

595
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,080
[ __ ] every all those people's math and

596
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,599
all the rates they were using it and

597
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,119
everybody was hiding using it and

598
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,839
getting away with it

599
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,038
um you know and so now what's happened

600
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,519
is is that

601
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,359
a lot of these mites have survived

602
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,038
decades of people

603
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,918
spraying them with all kinds of funky

604
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,599
[ __ ] yeah yeah and so they're a lot

605
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,360
they're a lot stronger and they're a lot

606
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,519
more resistant in california than your

607
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,759
average might would be in the wild that

608
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,519
[ __ ] in san diego back in the day dude

609
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,440
they would drink out of it they'd take a

610
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,519
shot and say [ __ ] you you know like they

611
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,320
were they're brutal yeah i mean there's

612
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,759
there there's uh it's it's not

613
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,038
you know and then everything gets

614
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,558
overused

615
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,158
and just like anything else if you don't

616
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,000
actually eliminate the problem if you

617
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,960
just knock the problem down to low

618
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
levels

619
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,400
and you keep doing that over and over

620
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,080
and over again

621
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,600
eventually the ones that survive are

622
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,519
going to be better at resisting whatever

623
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:17,519
you're using yeah and it could be

624
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:21,200
totally organic it could be evil like uh

625
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,798
avid or forbid or kantos or

626
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,798
you know there's those aren't evil i

627
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:28,960
don't like being sued there's a

628
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,119
just in the sense of you know i mean

629
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
everything has its place i suppose but

630
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,599
yeah

631
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
and i don't want to be sad

632
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,079
but

633
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,919
well you know i mean all that stuff

634
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,439
comes from the only reason why that [ __ ]

635
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,240
exists is because it's all over your

636
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,840
[ __ ] food yeah yep

637
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,798
you know it doesn't exist for weed

638
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,959
people

639
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,918
all those all those crazy chemicals and

640
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,000
stuff eagle 20 and all that stuff it all

641
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,200
exists because it gets used all the time

642
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,519
in commercial food production yeah

643
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,159
that's why you could even buy it i

644
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,759
remember back in the day the big mix in

645
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,320
our old cruise i shouldn't even admit

646
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,400
this but it was a long time ago before

647
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,839
before you know a lot of the information

648
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,519
was available even though you could

649
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,639
smell it you could smell the toxicity

650
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,879
but it was a

651
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,960
phyton 27 and

652
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,559
spectrocyte immunox

653
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,880
yeah for some reason seemed to just

654
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,038
knock pm out but it would also murder

655
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,559
your [ __ ] plants you know yeah emunox

656
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,279
is kind of like a derivative it's like

657
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,240
another brand name for eagle 20. yep you

658
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,798
know

659
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,120
and uh yeah the eagle 20 gets sprayed

660
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,679
for grapes uh avid a lot of these things

661
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,918
are designed for ornamentals too yeah

662
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,559
yep you know uh you know points that

663
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,559
like the like the [ __ ] pgr [ __ ]

664
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,839
yeah right where everybody you know for

665
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,278
a while where if you were super

666
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,558
unethical and you wanted to get two or

667
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,119
three pounds of light and you didn't

668
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,319
care about quality you would pgr your

669
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,199
weed and it was

670
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,480
it had it had a bunch of names right

671
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,919
phospholoed or

672
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,679
you know there was there was a number of

673
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,960
companies that would all hide what it

674
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,720
actually was

675
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,159
and it's the same [ __ ] that makes like

676
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,079
when you walk into a grocery store

677
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,240
around christmas and all the poinsettias

678
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,839
are the same [ __ ] height to the inch

679
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,038
yeah that's because they got treated

680
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,519
with a pgr

681
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,240
yeah i mean i think i think the term pgr

682
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,400
has been demonized just like uh gmo or

683
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,640
anything like that whether it has sure

684
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,679
yeah i mean there are great pgrs and

685
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
you don't even know what you're talking

686
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,919
about because there are actually pgrs

687
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,720
that we all use that are decent i will

688
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,799
say

689
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
that uh a lot of the companies would

690
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,879
hide the

691
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,840
the

692
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
[ __ ]

693
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,839
uh what was on the label oh for sure

694
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,519
right sure and then eventually they they

695
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,199
got caught onto and they all got pulled

696
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,240
off the shelf or whatever

697
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,880
and uh uh sunlight supply came out with

698
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,120
one that they called dr nodes

699
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,000
and it was fully vetted through all the

700
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,399
all the various agencies right yep so

701
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,159
i uh my my buddy had a shop and they got

702
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,480
all these samples and one of the samples

703
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,360
was this bottle of dr notes

704
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
right

705
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,959
and i'm looking at it and it was a

706
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,319
bottle and it came in its own plastic

707
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,759
sheath that you kind of like almost like

708
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,399
a medicine thing that you had to rip

709
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,919
open and do that right yeah and one of

710
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,440
its warnings was

711
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,679
pregnant women should not touch the

712
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,120
bottle

713
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,320
right

714
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,079
that's safe

715
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,599
that's pretty heavy but like on the same

716
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,879
on the same tip

717
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,359
uh a natural pgr is kelp

718
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,120
yeah you apply too strong a kelp you'll

719
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,479
plan or do some weird [ __ ]

720
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,479
yeah so you're right in the sense that

721
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,919
it's just a term that exists yeah

722
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,360
what most people are thinking of when

723
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,520
they think of pgrs and weed is like

724
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,359
exactly like possible and like the name

725
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,960
is this long and it's methyl ethyl and

726
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,319
it has a bunch of parentheses and

727
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,159
hyphens

728
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,599
yeah yeah it's it's it's all it's all

729
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,880
kinds of bad [ __ ]

730
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,959
paclo you know i think it's the other

731
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
one

732
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,359
terrible

733
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,720
yeah uh and in addition to in addition

734
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:59,038
to um making your weeds super dense uh

735
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,079
it [ __ ] with your crystal content and

736
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,759
uh made your weed uh b grade yeah

737
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,519
definitely and there's a lot of

738
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,278
companies and this is even [ __ ] up

739
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,679
even if you weren't evil

740
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,839
uh and use the [ __ ] sorry if you used it

741
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,759
and i just called you evil but

742
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,119
they didn't put it on the label on lots

743
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,558
of things and then there's other

744
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,639
companies that would put it into like

745
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,480
bud blasters and things like that and

746
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,840
they would just put small amounts for

747
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,558
that extra oomph

748
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,158
yep

749
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,158
it's all part of that [ __ ] nutrient

750
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,720
game which yeah i mean after making the

751
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,360
spray um and and learning about

752
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,519
different nutrients how they're sold how

753
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,839
you get regulated how you get you know

754
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,519
omri listed all that stuff it's just

755
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,079
like to me like it was like learning

756
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,918
about the the vitamin

757
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,199
like like

758
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
what do they call it like when you go to

759
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,278
those muscle stores or whatever you can

760
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,119
buy all their supplements supplements

761
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,679
it's like stuff i'm sorry i have to i

762
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,239
have to interject too yeah uh you know

763
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,759
someone's couples couple people said uh

764
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,679
gravity and [ __ ] like that which is

765
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,000
definitely one of the things and then

766
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,120
someone was like yes it's illegal to not

767
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,400
have everything on the label yes

768
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,158
and you'll be shocked to know that

769
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
people making products for cannabis

770
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,000
people were willing to do something

771
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,000
illegal

772
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,038
and that not all of them had the highest

773
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,798
of ethical standards yeah but they got

774
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,798
that purple max though i mean that

775
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,398
gravity [ __ ] or whatever i i had a

776
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,839
friend uh

777
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,678
who literally was like an early

778
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,720
proponent of you know you'd probably

779
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,200
call living soil today yeah i was super

780
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,960
anal about inputs and all this different

781
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,519
stuff and so he comes in and he buys

782
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,200
some of that uh and all it says on the

783
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,319
label is kelp

784
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,798
yeah

785
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,480
but it had the full paclo in it oh sure

786
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,759
and so he goes out there and he makes a

787
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,759
whole resi and he waters all his beds

788
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,679
and he'd had those beds for like five

789
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,038
six years and had been developing them

790
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,200
every year and then he went and sprayed

791
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,720
him with paclo because it wasn't on the

792
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,360
it wasn't on the label he thought it was

793
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,600
killed and nobody knew to tell him

794
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,558
yeah you know

795
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,558
so

796
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,240
um yeah that some of that stuff was

797
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,319
insidious they were trying to sell you a

798
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,120
product that you'd buy again

799
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,879
yeah

800
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,479
yeah i mean and it's just like

801
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,799
i look at it like drug dealers who press

802
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,159
their pills and like you know double the

803
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,440
strength of their xanax of course people

804
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,640
are going to go back to that [ __ ]

805
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,880
dude if they want to get all super

806
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,799
[ __ ] up and die so i mean there's even

807
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,760
there's even pesticides that have gotten

808
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,960
caught

809
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,200
right that have gotten pulled from the

810
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,038
shelves in california uh because they

811
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,440
listed you know clove oil and this and

812
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,440
that whatever to kill bugs and then they

813
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,679
test it and it's got avid it's got

814
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,840
abimectin in there yeah yeah it's got tr

815
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,960
it's got low amounts of something that

816
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,839
really works

817
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
yeah

818
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,519
you know and then they just figure is

819
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,678
someone actually going to analyze my

820
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,519
secret sauce

821
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,200
probably especially people do

822
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,798
you know eventually people do i mean

823
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,600
there was a there's there's been times

824
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,359
where

825
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,759
like uh weights and measures has come

826
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,158
into growth stores yeah i bet

827
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,558
and by law you know if it says it's 40

828
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,159
ounces it better be 40 ounces if it says

829
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,960
it's x amount of pounds it better be

830
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,200
that

831
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,480
yeah and they'll pull all their [ __ ] off

832
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,720
the shelves

833
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,919
oh yeah because it doesn't weigh right

834
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,079
yeah i think people are asking about

835
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,200
powers i know that's a um

836
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,839
ortho solicitor or monosolicit um

837
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,440
acid it's it's it's uh it's a

838
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,839
silic basically what it is is it's

839
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,399
silica in a form that's a lot more

840
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,439
absorbable for the plant yeah there's a

841
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,519
lot of [ __ ]

842
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,000
there's a lot of silica out there that

843
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,000
is not that easily plant absorbable yeah

844
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,798
it's not available for cannabis unless

845
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,119
you reuse your soil for you yeah and so

846
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,798
and so as a result uh

847
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,158
there's there's a number cutting edge

848
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:41,918
has one um power c is one there's a

849
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,240
bunch of them that put it basically in a

850
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,159
different in a different suspension yeah

851
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,558
lack of a better way to put it uh that

852
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,919
makes it uh that makes silicoic acid

853
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,519
that makes it a little bit easier for

854
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,480
the roots and the plant to actually

855
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,480
uptake

856
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,798
yeah that's one of the few products like

857
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,000
that that i really actually visually can

858
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,839
see change within 24 hours of using it i

859
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,640
i was a big fan of it

860
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,839
it's expensive as [ __ ] but yeah people

861
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,559
are talking about and there's enzyme

862
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,599
products the market a lot longer right

863
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,398
now

864
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,558
uh enzyme enzyme products are uh

865
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,759
um i use them a bunch actually there's

866
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,278
nukem and and dr zimes and all these and

867
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,919
they're all basically this this their

868
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,880
enzymes that [ __ ] with the sh the

869
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,038
ecoskeleton of the pl of the bug

870
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,880
and there's citric acid in there yeah

871
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,278
right and they're really gentle and a

872
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,600
lot of more organic and they test clean

873
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,278
and they absolutely annihilate

874
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,199
uh powdery mildew

875
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,319
uh and they do a pretty good job killing

876
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,399
mites too

877
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,119
yeah i'm still i'm still a big proponent

878
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,759
now because of you of the um

879
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,678
what's that [ __ ] called the micro

880
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,558
sulfur micronized sulfur micronized

881
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,320
sulfur yeah yeah that's a truth

882
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,599
i mean micronized sulfur if you don't

883
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,839
use oils

884
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,558
yeah and you spray micronized sulfur i

885
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,918
learned that way you'll never uh you'll

886
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:04,720
never have russet mites uh or pm in your

887
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,720
veg ever yeah it was beautiful except

888
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,360
when i used them both together in the

889
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,600
same bottle like a absolute fool and

890
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,519
burped up every plant that i had

891
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,599
and well yeah they'll burn hairs though

892
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,278
that's why i said in veg yeah yeah for

893
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,558
sure you know you'll definitely uh

894
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,839
sulfur is a really uh distinctive aroma

895
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,158
and you definitely don't want to be

896
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,359
using sulfur for any reason much past

897
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,760
the first week

898
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:30,319
yeah once you start sand to me

899
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,558
uh it's it's not a good idea but in veg

900
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,119
when it's just all sticks and stems

901
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:38,480
you know and leaves it's organic it's

902
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,959
safe it's you know yeah

903
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,319
it uh it works really well

904
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,880
um i

905
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,599
totally got away from oils simply

906
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,240
because i like sulfur in the rotation as

907
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,319
a safety measure in the veg and plants

908
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,000
tend to like it a lot and i don't so i

909
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,960
don't use oils at all

910
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,558
because

911
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,919
god help you if you got russets or

912
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,879
something like that

913
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,480
um you know it'll it'll annihilate those

914
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,480
yeah it's i think it's safe to use

915
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,839
indoor but i don't like put on masks

916
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,319
when i spray either so what the [ __ ] do

917
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,599
i know it is safe to use indoor

918
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,359
um but i put i would put on masks

919
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,639
you know yeah even smart people put the

920
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,558
shipping on that there's a lot of stuff

921
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,278
quote-unquote that's safe

922
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,158
um that i might only put on like a

923
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,558
uh like a a snowboarding shell or

924
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,278
something to spray but i have a full

925
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,599
face mask with a visor and the whole bit

926
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,960
right yeah because it might be safe for

927
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,319
your plants but that doesn't mean your

928
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,840
lungs want it

929
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,119
yeah no i don't want to breathe in

930
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,720
wettables so i don't want to breathe in

931
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,038
anything

932
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
like on that level you know so i always

933
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,240
wear a mat i don't want in my eyes

934
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,440
either

935
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,960
yeah it's probably not good it's

936
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,840
probably why i'm [ __ ] blind to be

937
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,360
honest with you yeah i mean uh you know

938
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,480
it's uh

939
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,038
it

940
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,960
i just i you know did i always do that

941
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,679
no as i got older

942
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,640
yes as i've gotten older i've tried to

943
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,240
to be more i have a real nice i don't

944
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,559
know it's a two or three hundred dollar

945
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,679
full face mask or whatnot and even for

946
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,519
the most basic stuff i put it on

947
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,120
someone said they started using sulfur

948
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,519
because that guy who said sulfur is how

949
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,518
to get our gas turbs

950
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,919
i mean it'll definitely make your weed

951
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,000
smell and taste like a tire fire

952
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,600
yeah i mean if you use it wrong yeah if

953
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,839
you feed it

954
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,439
to the roots it does you know increase

955
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,079
terpenes whatever it has it's not going

956
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,558
to change somebody said yeah nukem nukem

957
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:31,918
and sulfur or nukem and dr zymes and

958
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,200
sulfur or whatever you can use them back

959
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,880
to back

960
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,480
there's not oil in there so you could

961
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,039
use it i've done it a bunch it's

962
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,360
completely safe the only thing something

963
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,359
happens when you combine oil and sulfur

964
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,398
it changes the ph on the plant and it

965
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,199
burns them to [ __ ] yeah it murders them

966
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:48,079
so

967
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,960
do you

968
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,678
uh sulfur is sulfur is very

969
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,519
uh very very safe

970
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,759
as long as no don't mix it with oil i

971
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:02,319
never usually do lines of um pure weight

972
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:05,200
if it's over 90 degrees sulfur can

973
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,359
really hurt your plants yeah for sure so

974
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,079
uh don't if you know uh

975
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:13,039
we me me and uh our buddy and i we uh

976
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,800
one of the fires in 2019 i think it was

977
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,719
2018 maybe

978
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,760
uh we had sprayed sulfur the night

979
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,398
before

980
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,159
and then the next day one of the biggest

981
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,239
fires in california history started a

982
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,679
couple hills over from us

983
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,598
and the first thing it did was burn out

984
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
a bunch of power poles

985
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,359
right

986
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,119
it was 108 degrees

987
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,878
and the lighting went out but so did the

988
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,320
air conditioning and all the fans and

989
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:37,838
everything we had because the power

990
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
poles bent and fell

991
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:42,078
yeah and it got real hot and we lost a

992
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,158
bunch of moms

993
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,919

994
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,039
yeah from the day before

995
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,799
that's uh

996
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,878
there's a lot of things that's sucked

997
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,399
about that fire but yeah um i mean we

998
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,118
didn't have power at that spot for

999
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,118
almost two weeks

1000
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
you know and it was june and you have a

1001
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,960
debt and i mean there was problems there

1002
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,119
was issues you know

1003
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,559
yeah um so

1004
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,358
but yeah i mean

1005
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,719
uh people uh trying to read and talk or

1006
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:09,838
whatever but

1007
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,598
i didn't even think we actually

1008
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,078
bullshitted for on a totally different

1009
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,519
direction yeah that's all right yeah

1010
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,640
don't get don't get sulfur on your

1011
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,480
lights

1012
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,118
you know um

1013
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,719
but yeah sulfur sulfur works better than

1014
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,680
anything i've ever seen against russet

1015
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,559
mites

1016
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:28,960
yeah it absolutely annihilates them and

1017
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,199
it annihilates powdery mildew yeah i

1018
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,960
never had rusted mites in my life so i

1019
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,358
should knock on wood somewhere but

1020
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,559
powdery mildew i you know was it's even

1021
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,719
a problem in bakersfield where it's

1022
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,639
super dry and i mean do you know that do

1023
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,719
you know that they consider uh russet

1024
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,118
mites ariel plankton

1025
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,598
no that's weird you ever heard that word

1026
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,760
aerial plankton no but

1027
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,079
so area so obviously plankton in the

1028
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,760
ocean yeah they just get carried around

1029
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,760
by the currents

1030
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,720
yeah right

1031
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,400
russets are so small they can get just

1032
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,598
carried by wind currents for long

1033
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,358
distances

1034
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,280
yeah they're that's why they call them

1035
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,358
aerial plankton because it's like living

1036
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,160
things that are just getting carried

1037
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,039
along by current in this case wind

1038
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,879
current

1039
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,480
so you could have a neighbor a couple

1040
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,000
hills over

1041
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,679
and the wind could be going the wrong

1042
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,519
way and they could definitely start

1043
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,519
blowing off their plants and right up

1044
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,400
the hill and right up into your ship

1045
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,239
yeah

1046
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,079
and that's how a lot of people got them

1047
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,479
in mendo actually was they spread

1048
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,280
neighbor to neighbor farm to farm

1049
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,358
you'd be you'd be downwind from someone

1050
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,320
and about july august their garden would

1051
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,519
[ __ ] you

1052
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,880
yeah

1053
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,559
and so you could take all the

1054
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,960
precautions in the world about

1055
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,239
quarantine and bringing in clean stuff

1056
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,639
and not allowing pests in you know

1057
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,799
and then they came in on the wind

1058
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,598
ain't that a [ __ ]

1059
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,440
so somebody just said uh spin assad i'm

1060
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,359
sure there's there's uh

1061
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,838
i'm sure there is

1062
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,159
spinosad is a cool story actually i

1063
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,559
don't know if you've ever heard it but

1064
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,519
spinozad is like a uh

1065
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,960
is basically a bug killing uh fungus

1066
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,838
yeah right

1067
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,559
and they discovered it in the caribbean

1068
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,679
right

1069
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:16,159
uh there was an old uh rum mill

1070
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,838
and they went into this big old factory

1071
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,319
you know rum factory

1072
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,559
and they noticed there was no bugs

1073
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,640
yeah although there was like zero no

1074
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,880
spiders no bugs of any kind so they took

1075
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,799
soil samples and they found spinosad a

1076
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,119
and d

1077
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,519
yeah and uh that's what that's what when

1078
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,280
you buy spinosad that's what that's what

1079
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,599
it comes from it comes from them

1080
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,040
discovering this thing right yeah

1081
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,400
um but

1082
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,358
the reason why you shouldn't [ __ ] use

1083
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,720
it is that it is

1084
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:49,119
rel it is terrible first beats

1085
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,639
yeah it is one of the most toxic things

1086
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,559
for bees

1087
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,719
um so it's safe for you and it's safe

1088
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,159
for people and and animals and all that

1089
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,719
type of stuff but

1090
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,000
it'll take out a whole beehive that

1091
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,519
sucks

1092
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,199
um so it's not it's not uh

1093
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,800
you know i mean i guess if you were

1094
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,039
indoor

1095
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,880
you could safely use it on your plants

1096
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,559
yeah um and you really wouldn't have too

1097
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,800
much risk or be or you know be an

1098
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,199
[ __ ] about it but yeah uh if you're

1099
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,720
gonna spray it on a bunch of your um

1100
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,559
your depths or your outdoors or

1101
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,439
something like that you'll put you might

1102
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,838
kill

1103
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,519
the natural bees all in your area

1104
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,039
you might just take them off

1105
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,800
yeah and they they have their own they

1106
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,639
have they have enough struggles going on

1107
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,240
right now bee populations with a lot of

1108
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,440
things that are [ __ ] with them so

1109
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,639
yeah um

1110
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,400
i would definitely i i could never in

1111
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,719
in good conscience recommend somebody

1112
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,880
use it in their depth or their outside

1113
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,919
yeah you know i don't want to hear some

1114
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,680
[ __ ] on og when we can get to that sucka

1115
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,599
we're there i mean i don't know we just

1116
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,838
we just took it and we just took it in

1117
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,079
that direction uh but you know there's a

1118
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,239
bunch of people listening so if if we

1119
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,039
talked about certain things and and why

1120
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,319
not to use them that's cool too yeah uh

1121
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,480
and that's the reason when people say

1122
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,559
oklahoma or california there's testing

1123
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,599
for it it's not because it's harmful to

1124
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,078
humans

1125
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,640
it's because bees pollinate half of our

1126
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,480
food sources yeah and so we really

1127
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,519
really don't want them to die

1128
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,199
yeah

1129
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,639
and they are dying at a rapid rate and

1130
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,078
they're dying at a rapid rate from a

1131
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,000
bunch of different issues and from a

1132
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,240
bunch of exposure to toxins and

1133
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,800
pesticides and herbicides

1134
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,799
and other and other stresses or whatever

1135
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,480
and literally there's an immense amount

1136
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,280
of stuff that you eat that wouldn't get

1137
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,280
pollinated if it wasn't for bees yeah so

1138
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,680
spraying a [ __ ] ton of

1139
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,720
bee killer

1140
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,759
you know yeah it's a little rough

1141
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,799
so

1142
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,800
um

1143
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,519
all right so we can we can talk we can

1144
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,119
talk about kush uh oh this already just

1145
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,199
i just totally changed my mind and don't

1146
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,680
want to talk about it at all from oh my

1147
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:54,159
god i'm just kidding yeah i know but

1148
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,319
yeah so but yeah but i mean it it there

1149
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:59,279
could be there could be now that we've

1150
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,800
been chatting about it for a while yeah

1151
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,800
you know not right now but like our

1152
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,240
experiences in the future or people want

1153
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,160
to know about pesticide or or tech or

1154
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,639
how to beat certain things or what works

1155
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,078
or what doesn't um living up here

1156
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,440
surrounded by growers i mean i've kind

1157
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,318
of seen about just about everything

1158
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,318
tried

1159
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,159
yeah and you start to poke around and

1160
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,400
what works and what doesn't what what

1161
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,679
are the downsides to this thing

1162
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,039
yeah because most things have downsides

1163
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,639
you know so you got to pick which ones

1164
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,800
you're okay with yeah you know

1165
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,960
definitely but

1166
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,119
if people want to hear about og

1171
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,280
by any means

1172
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,239
you know but we you know what we thought

1173
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
like

1174
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,879
so

1175
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,119
there's there's like the the most

1176
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,880
mysterious part about it is the is the

1177
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,800
florida history

1178
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,039
right it starts getting a little bit

1179
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,318
more definitive and understood once it

1180
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,000
got to california yeah yeah right so

1181
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:05,599
what we thought is like obviously this

1182
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,559
is like i mean there's been whole shows

1183
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,119
where people

1184
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,759
confidently talk about the origins of og

1185
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,358
and this and that and everything else

1186
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,119

yeah and made his way to florida from

1201
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,920
there neville did have apparently many

1202
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,199
backups everywhere yeah there's uh

1203
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,880
there's uh

1204
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,480
you know there's a story like he just

1205
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,760
said that you know frank is a guy that

1206
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,240
had a bunch of

1207
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,680
uh basically undergrounds and warehouses

1208
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,559
and big grows

1209
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:05,440
uh in the southwest uh you know uh

1210
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,759
united states arizona arizona and new

1211
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,000
mexico issue and all that and um

1212
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,280
there's rumor that it came from there

1213
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,599
uh it certainly seems guaranteed to have

1214
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,200
come from florida people

1215
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,599
coming out this way

1216
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,199
me and fatty did meet uh old dave

1217
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,039
richards he was there when when i met

1218
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,719
that guy and he was still he he had a

1219
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,440
circle around him telling the tales of

1220
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,239
og and how he [ __ ] made it

1221
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,000
i mean i i've met i've met uh dave

1222
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,719
richards he's a character did you meet

1223
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,199
him yeah i met him he's he smokes black

1224
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,759
and milds on one of those [ __ ] things

1225
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,598
yeah yeah he's i liked him in person

1226
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,560
like there's i'm not even gonna lie like

1227
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,400
he's a funny dude like he's he's

1228
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,318
personable yeah he's personable it's

1229
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,240
hard not to like him but when i first

1230
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,679
realized how much he was lying to me i

1231
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,399
was like okay

1232
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:57,279
come on dude like it was so easy to snap

1233
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,119
he's personable and so there's a there's

1234
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,880
an aspect where

1235
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,920
mark's castle yes that's another claim

1236
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,119
that's right

1237
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,880
anyway there's

1238
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,880
basically what it boils down to is that

1239
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,358
kush became

1240
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,318
one of those things that ended up being

1241
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,480
so famous and made so many people money

1242
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,400
that there's a lot of people invested in

1243
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,480
trying to be like

1244
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,280
you should give me rep because my crew

1245
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,639
or my family or my whatever my friends

1246
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,240
are the ones that brought this to the

1247
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,559
world yes

1248
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,118
and so people come out of the woodwork

1249
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,440
you know i mean uh and i'm not trying to

1250
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,200
call individuals out but it's like

1251
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,720
there's everything from those crazy

1252
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,239
stories we told you

1253
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,000
to the one that matt and i tend to

1254
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,318
believe which there was like an accident

1255
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,119
and a closet and it came out of some bag

1256
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,480
seed

1257
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,400
you know to

1258
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,159
uh ever-changing story from tk origins

1259
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,480
uh with different years and different

1260
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,358
plants and different certainties

1261
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,760
you know um and you know it's also

1262
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,920
possible too that like it's

1263
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,240
you know it's it went it was it was

1264
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,000
strained by a different name

1265
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,318
and now we just know it is kush yes

1266
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,358
you know i mean we we you know neville

1267
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,960
told uh neville told matt that he

1268
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,480
thought that most of the american cush

1269
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,720
stuff was based off his kush 4 and l2

1270
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,039
yes yeah you know and it was all just it

1271
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,719
was all just phenos of that he just

1272
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,960
thought it was nl2 expression out of

1273
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,959
that yeah you thought this is nl2 this

1274
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,880
is mine obvious

1275
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,679
right and so you know and then you know

1276
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,960
there's

1277
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,159
so there's all these different things

1278
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,039
but what regardless of all that uh

1279
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:37,039
you know

1280
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,800
um yeah someone you know uh there's uh

1281
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,480
there's a bunch of rumor

1282
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,000
yeah and since we don't know any of the

1283
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,639
parents

1284
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,079
right it allows basically anyone to step

1285
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,159
in and say

1286
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,240
[ __ ] this is the story

1287
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,960
well i mean i also think because the way

1288
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,879
og expresses being long and lanky with

1289
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,440
dense snug so it looks like what we

1290
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,519
would just consider traditionally as

1291
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,318
like a sativa because it's so long and

1292
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,960
lenky but then it has these dense

1293
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,639
nugs and resin like an afghani so it's

1294
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,639
really easy to just make up [ __ ] and

1295
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,039
be like that's a [ __ ] nepalese and

1296
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,039
just some random sativa and some random

1297
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,440
afghani you know so maybe we'll go way

1298
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,279
the [ __ ] back for a second okay right

1299
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,960
start start at the back we'll start at

1300
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,079
the very beginning

1301
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,800
okay so

1302
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,640
the very beginning of kush in america

1303
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,039
and we have no idea if this relates to

1304
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,440
the cush that everyone is familiar with

1305
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,358
but people would bring back seed from

1306
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,519
the hindu kush mountain region of

1307
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:37,440
afghanistan and pakistan

1308
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:40,400
and those mountain valleys had the kush

1309
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,200
yes right and that was the first term

1310
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,880
sam skunk man had a hindu kush

1311
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,118
that was the hindu kush mountain region

1312
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,838
yeah the hindu kush mountain region uh

1313
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,720
the indian supposedly gave seattle greg

1314
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:55,119
a kush that got put into nl2

1315
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,799
um you know uh there's various ones

1316
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,599
right and

1317
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,079
so

1318
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,359
it used to be a generalized term for a

1319
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,318
region

1320
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,920
yes right where now if you fast forward

1321
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,639
40 years today

1322
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,838
it basically goes back to

1323
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,199
you know uh the kush that went to la

1324
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:14,799
the tk

1325
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,358
that type of thing is like that's what

1326
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,920
everyone thinks of as kush yeah so it

1327
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:22,880
went from like a region and all these

1328
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,480
different afghans within that region yes

1329
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,599
to like a very specific phenoexpression

1330
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,679
and look

1331
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,680
yes was kush and so now if you talk

1332
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,480
about kush today you're not talking

1333
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,960
about the region anymore with anyone

1334
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,920
right yeah they're specifically talking

1335
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,880
about

1336
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,280
a specific phenotypic expression and a

1337
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,200
look and there's variance within that

1338
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,079
look but it's got some key

1339
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,598
characteristics and one second i just

1340
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,680
for everyone that keeps mentioning the

1341
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,680
packy lemon tie i will tell the actual

1342
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,759
story behind how that how that came to

1343
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,159
be and you it you'll laugh your ass off

1344
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,760
so let's continue so so anyway so it

1345
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:00,879
started off as it started off as a

1346
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
region

1347
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,440
right

1348
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,800
and maybe we should talk about the

1349
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,358
region for just a second because it

1350
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,680
might interest people right okay so

1351
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,000
i i have this theory and i've and i've

1352
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,598
seen it in some different places and all

1353
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,559
that and

1354
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,240
like

1355
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,799
and we've bounced it around and i would

1356
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,558
so i wouldn't say it's like a a theory

1357
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,920
that's like you know you couldn't poke

1358
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,599
holes in but i think it can hold

1359
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,318
generally true

1360
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,920
where if you look at afghanistan there

1361
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,838
is parts of afghanistan that are

1362
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,159
anywhere from sea level all the way up

1363
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,358
to 10 000 feet yeah

1364
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,639
right there's a lot of different

1365
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,400
elevations so like mazar uh that region

1366
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:39,279
that's maybe only 800 feet above sea

1367
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,519
level

1368
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,519
yes but there's areas in the hindu kush

1369
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,960
valleys that are five six seven thousand

1370
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,239
feet where they grow vegetables and

1371
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,599
wheat yeah and so what tends to be is

1372
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:54,239
that when you get the lowland afghans

1373
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:57,119
that are in the foothills or the plains

1374
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,759
or sea level in pakistan or afghanistan

1375
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,880
they tend to be these squat

1376
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,400
bigger

1377
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,599
like fluffier

1378
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,920
plants with much wider leaves

1379
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,640
right they're not as dense

1380
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,119
um they're growing in more humid areas

1381
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,318
right a little bit um and they're lower

1382
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,200
to the ground and they have these big

1383
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:19,440
fat wide leaves and then you get up into

1384
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,759
these high mountain regions

1385
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,559
okay which also has afghans and those

1386
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,160
afghans kind of sound a lot like what

1387
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,400
matt described with the kush that

1388
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,960
everyone's familiar with yeah skinny

1389
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,280
leaves but indica

1390
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,639
right not not big fat wide leaves but

1391
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,599
skinny leaves

1392
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:39,358
golf ball type much tighter type nugs

1393
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,680
right yeah and you think about the

1394
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:44,799
environment that they're in very cold

1395
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:47,598
colder drier a lot more uv

1396
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,240
right yeah and so the leaves are smaller

1397
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,280
because catching all that uv is bad

1398
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,799
yes the intensity is more i think i

1399
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,720
think well i was talking about this with

1400
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,800
csi because i don't have a lot of uh

1401
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:02,000
experience with outdoor other than a few

1402
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,960
you know like uh depth runs in san diego

1403
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,358
but

1404
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,880
i noticed that even with the nl5s

1405
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,358
they're expressing way more narrow

1406
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,680
outdoors and it's just a trait that

1407
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,000
outdoors because of humidity and other

1408
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,159
other things and transpiration they're

1409
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,599
just naturally more narrow there's gonna

1410
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,519
be there's the plant's gonna have a

1411
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,880
range of expressions based on all kinds

1412
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,039
of factors yeah uh and you know uh homie

1413
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,519
just said you know uv protection the

1414
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:30,318
higher up you go in elevation the less

1415
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,519
atmosphere there is the less uv is

1416
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:33,199
filtered out

1417
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,519
yeah right

1418
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,118
and so obviously even though the plant

1419
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,800
might come from afghanistan if it

1420
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,519
developed in a valley that's six or

1421
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,920
seven thousand feet above sea level

1422
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,920
and it's a mountain region that kind of

1423
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,960
cold and day night temperatures and a

1424
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,639
lot of things it's going to have

1425
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,960
different breeding pressures and

1426
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,598
different plants that are successful

1427
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,480
yeah versus a lowland plant from the

1428
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,160
plain that gets you know moisture off

1429
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,199
the ocean

1430
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:00,159
that's going to be a different kind of

1431
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,439
plan

1432
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,358
yeah and i think there's a lot of

1433
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,200
misconception where people think all

1434
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,440
thin leaf is sativa

1435
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:11,199
and the broader and fatter it is the

1436
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,920
more indica it is yeah you can have

1437
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,960
narrow leaf pure indica

1438
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,720
yeah

1439
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,480
you know it just happens to it's just

1440
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,279
usually highland weed

1441
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,679
yeah

1442
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,200
not lowland weed

1443
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:24,960
you know and i think that's a big

1444
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:26,799
misconception

1445
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,159
yeah for a lot of people

1446
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,559
yeah i think right as a major

1447
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:32,558
misconception yeah is is all indica and

1448
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,240
all afghan the broader the broader is

1449
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,519
the more afghan

1450
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:40,239
and the narrowers the more sativa yeah

1451
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:42,239
you know and maybe if you a broad leaf

1452
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,318
afghan to a narrow leaf sativa that

1453
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,000
would be true in the children

1454
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,920
yeah

1455
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,800
you know um and so now so so anyway so

1456
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,880
there's

1457
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,800
highland afghan there's a lot of there's

1458
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,559
a lot of mountain valley weed

1459
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,200
yeah and there was a lot there was a

1460
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,519
bunch of weed coming over to america

1461
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,118
called hindu kush

1462
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,679
because that was the big mountain range

1463
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,720
and all the valleys that uh that it came

1464
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,239
from yeah and dirty old sag is saying

1465
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,239
there's hash plants because those were

1466
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,318
all hash plants all those i love

1467
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,959
lebanese my red leaf that i had was also

1468
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,960
a narrow leaf but it grew like a a big

1469
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,920
afghan sideways it was real [ __ ]

1470
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,920
weird yeah yeah and so there's just you

1471
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,159
know like a lot of times and it makes

1472
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,200
sense like you read books and you see

1473
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:31,118
what you're familiar with in america

1474
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:32,639
right and there's certain assumptions

1475
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,680
that get made but they're not always the

1476
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,039
true ones

1477
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,598
yeah

1478
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,920
you know um and

1479
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,760
you know and and you know narrow it and

1480
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,079
and what i mean by narrow leaf is just

1481
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,520
like obviously there's a range

1482
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,519
yeah bodhi has a lot of really good

1483
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,358
narrow leaf afghanis and pakis he's put

1484
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,519
out if people are interested

1485
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,799
yeah and so it's just and and so a lot

1486
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,039
of times i

1487
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,318
i believe very strongly i can't say it's

1488
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,239
a hundred percent fact but i believe

1489
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,000
very strongly that almost all those

1490
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:03,279
narrow leaf indica types

1491
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,199
developed in high altitude regions

1492
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,319
of those mountain ranges where they

1493
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,759
didn't need as much leaf to capture

1494
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:11,920
light

1495
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,319
they needed less of it right because

1496
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,400
each leaf has a job right yeah it's

1497
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,519
there to transpire water and it's there

1498
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,119
to catch sunlight pet trees and water

1499
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,519
transportation

1500
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,480
yeah if it if it uh

1501
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:26,000
um

1502
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,599
on my buddy i was visiting my friend

1503
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,440
yesterday and he was showing me an

1504
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,519
afghan and it was thin leafed and fluffy

1505
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,358
as hell yeah yeah so you know the leaf

1506
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,039
has a job and if it's way up there in

1507
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,719
the mountain valleys and it can do its

1508
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,239
job on a skinny leaf then it's not going

1509
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,838
to put a bunch of effort into growing a

1510
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,399
big fat

1511
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:44,000
thick leaf yeah

1512
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,160
is there no narrow leaf indica type or

1513
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,599
hybrid oracle expresses many different

1514
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,279
ways i've seen it be narrow and i've

1515
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,119
seen it be broad

1516
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,440
so one of those that it depends on the

1517
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,760
room the environment how

1518
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,960
narrow or broad it is so just as a

1519
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,119
general thing um a lot of times people

1520
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,519
you know people judge narrow or wide

1521
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,280
based on and and make guesses based on

1522
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,119
how sativa or how indica but that's not

1523
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,040
the whole story yeah and i honestly

1524
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,559
think that can tell the story about the

1525
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,558
[ __ ] and the tie

1526
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,599
yeah i honestly think some of the some

1527
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,200
of the

1528
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,519
the kush that we're familiar with some

1529
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:20,719
of its narrow leaf characteristics

1530
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:23,599
um led people to believe there was

1531
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:25,199
sativa in it

1532
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,640
yeah i think i think the stretchiness

1533
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,639
and all that [ __ ]

1534
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,960
and definitely it wasn't as broad as a

1535
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,480
lot of afghans despite the density

1536
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,000
but the story

1537
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,599
originated from

1538
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,760
there were two brothers back in the day

1539
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,680
that went by brothel brothers

1540
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,079
and one would call himself kailua kid

1541
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,919
and the other called himself nyc kid

1542
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,760
both i think are still around i know nyc

1543
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,920
kid is still

1544
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,079
but back then

1545
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,519
uh kailua kid who also went later on to

1546
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,599
start trichome kings and a few other

1547
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,199
things and paradise seeds mod was

1548
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,119
another name of his

1549
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,358
he made the claim that he brought og and

1550
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,240
that it was pakistani crossed a lemon

1551
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,440
tie

1552
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,959
lemon thai was a dutch flower string and

1553
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,159
i mean there are ties that are lemony

1554
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,000
but the one he was referring to was a

1555
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:11,199
dutch flower strain and he's not in

1556
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,119
[ __ ] og kush um is this that's one of

1557
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,279
the oldest stories that's been shot down

1558
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,599
more than almost any og kush origin

1559
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,079
story but to this day

1560
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,039
to this day people still [ __ ] repeat

1561
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,960
that [ __ ]

1562
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:24,960
ad nauseam because they don't know that

1563
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,920
the guy was a major scammer that started

1564
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,240
the story he's [ __ ] all of us all of

1565
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,760
us back in the day um and he made a lot

1566
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,199
of claims about asian fantasy and all

1567
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,960
kinds of other stupid [ __ ] it was just

1568
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,358
what he did uh i remember at one point

1569
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,480
he was selling seeds he called

1570
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:42,558
dog dog bud s ones and then i kind of

1571
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,719
called him out on he's like well [ __ ] i

1572
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,680
don't know man i got him in a bag

1573
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,279
labeled dog doggy doggy bud weed you

1574
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,199
know close enough

1575
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,599
so this is the guy that they're relying

1576
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:54,798
on for that story uh the the second

1577
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,039
story that we were talking about the

1578
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,358
frank giga story it was started by a guy

1579
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,119
named dave richards um and he told the

1580
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,798
story on adam dunn he came out he

1581
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,599
actually i believe adam dunn at one of

1582
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:08,318
the adam dunn cups gave him a lifetime

1583
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,559
achievement award for breeding and and

1584
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:12,719
bringing og kush to the masses

1585
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,079
um unfortunately dave richards made a

1586
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,480
lot of mistakes one of the first ones

1587
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,318
was that it was a it was a hash plant

1588
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,679
thai afghani which he kept referring to

1589
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:23,920
as htf now htaf is an old term from dj

1590
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,759
short referring to highland thai afghani

1591
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,680
so he was confabulating different stuff

1592
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,119
to make his story he also said that

1593
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:33,759
frank gigaax left a book behind

1594
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,440
with the breeding tips on og kush and

1595
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,599
everything about it when i spoke to

1596
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,039
frank gigaax directly and his daughter i

1597
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,798
went to lunch with his daughter and

1598
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,279
breakfast we went to a few different

1599
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:45,440
things but um i talked to frank g gax

1600
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,200
over the phone and he said that he wrote

1601
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,358
that book as a grow book for dummies in

1602
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,399
prison because he had nothing else to do

1603
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,558
so

1604
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,240
dave's store and also frankie got said

1605
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,480
they never bred there it was only

1606
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,838
commercial production and it was he gave

1607
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,838
a few different lines i want to say it

1608
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:01,920
was like nl

1609
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,480
for something weird that i i don't think

1610
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,159
you probably had um big budge skunk one

1611
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,318
and something else he said we did no

1612
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,759
breeding there whatsoever and he

1613
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,480
completely smashed that story to

1614
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,040
smithereens um but still people again

1615
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,519
repeat it constantly to this day as

1616
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,920
truth because it was aired once on a

1617
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,759
show you know um but those are the

1618
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,960
probably two of the biggest ones the the

1619
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,520
third being

1620
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,838
uh the creepy story and that's just

1621
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,358
silly like i mean i i don't think

1622
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,480
anybody that's been around a long time

1623
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:34,798
even gives that dude any kind of

1624
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,159
credit yeah it's not even worth the

1625
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,159
dressing to be honest with you on the

1626
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,519
creepy thing

1627
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,679
i mean what you know and then there's

1628
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:42,880
there's there's the story of how

1629
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:45,118
you know there was accidental

1630
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,079
pollinations in florida

1631
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,838
um and so really what what it seems like

1632
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,680
it does seem

1633
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:52,798
to me at least

1634
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:54,639
is that

1635
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,039
i do believe that there was multiple

1636
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,639
people that brought kush from florida to

1637
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,759
california

1638
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:01,920
yeah

1639
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,079
i think that's factual

1640
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,519
right yeah um

1641
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,760
you know we're you know because

1643
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,839
ricky and tk

1644

yes right he sent that out before he

1645
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:16,639
came out physically himself to the state

1646
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,359
yeah um people know about

1647
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:20,960

1648
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:23,279
uh matt bubba and uh and uh bubba kush

1649
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,119
and uh josh d

1650
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,040
i'll say i'll say

1651
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,640
flat out when i when i first talked to

1652
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,759
matt i thought he was full of [ __ ]

1653
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:31,358
because he comes off like a little bit

1654
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,680
of a used car salesman when you talk to

1655
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:36,000
him he's very friendly but it's his it's

1656
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,399
like his nature so i didn't believe him

1657
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,039
but everything that i've ever

1658
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,358
researched and found is he has not been

1659
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,960
wrong once and and as much as i was

1660
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:46,400
biased against him i've told him dude

1661
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,920
like i can't poke holes in your story

1662
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,559
unfortunately like i don't believe you

1663
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,920
but i can't poke holes in it so i'm left

1664
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,798
with a truth

1665
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,480
so

1666
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:56,798
so there's an aspect where

1667
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,760
and bubba bubba and that kush that went

1668
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:02,079
to la became very famous tk became very

1669
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,880
famous uh there's a strain that got sent

1670
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,559
to the bay uh that we called the florida

1671
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,318
uh that i've chatted about before and i

1672
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:11,680
posted about um that went into cookie uh

1673
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,759
and so

1674
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,960
what we don't know for sure

1675
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,960
uh uh irene irene comes a little bit

1676
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,280
later but that's another beautiful cush

1677
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,079
strain um but

1678
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,240
there are there were multiple people

1679
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,798
that got pushed to california to

1680
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,719
different people at different years we

1681
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,000
don't know huh let's slow down real

1682
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,759
quick because i think i think people

1683
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,599
would be interested in the irene story a

1684
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,799
little bit don't you think

1685
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:41,280
sure 100 yeah well so irene i'll let you

1686
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:43,358
tell it because yeah go for it so the

1687
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,960
original irene is as as best i can

1688
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:48,000
remember i wish rude boy was here right

1689
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,599
now but um the original irene was picked

1690
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,318
from a bag of weed that went from

1691
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:54,160
california to atlanta and what was kind

1692
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,159
of cool was that we were able to link up

1693
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:58,480
resin lung and his crew with the atlanta

1694
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:00,159
crew and how they were shipped

1695
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,000
i'm not going to say it i think we said

1696
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,440
it a few times but you can figure it out

1697
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,519
anyway they shipped it a certain way and

1698
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,119
it was so unique that when they were

1699
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:08,559
both telling the story it was like holy

1700
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,760
[ __ ] there's no way they just made that

1701
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,400
one up it was something that nobody

1702
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,400
would think of um it was originally from

1703
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,880
a bag of wheat and i want to say

1704
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:20,240
either the first irene was from a bag of

1705
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,079
larry og or the second irene that they

1706
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,759
picked after they lost the first irene

1707
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,680
they picked another selection that was

1708
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,280
the most similar to the first one and

1709
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,759
that came out of larioge if i remember

1710
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,119
correctly but that's the rough story the

1711
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,880
irene that we have now is what we would

1712
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,880
consider irene ii

1713
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,798
and that's the one almost everyone has

1714
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,400
grown only a few people like smoked a

1715
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:41,519
herb and rude boy

1716
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,160
really experienced the first diary

1717
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:47,838
so yeah so there's so basically

1718
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:49,118
if you move past the uh the the origin

1719
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,358
stories

1720
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,838
right right of who's responsible for it

1721
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,119
or where it came from yeah of which

1722
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,838
there are many

1723
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,358
um there was it does seem like the stuff

1724
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,759
that we know of

1725
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:04,798
uh made its way from

1726
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,000
florida to california yeah and we don't

1727
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:08,719
know

1728
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,960
exactly if all those things were the

1729
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:13,598
same cut

1730
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,599
or there was multiple cuts that came out

1731
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,280
or there is possibility that there's a

1732
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,640
cut that shared a name

1733
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,319
and was called different things by

1734
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:23,039
different crews those are totally

1735
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:25,358
possible right yeah but

1736
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,039
uh what really happened is

1737
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,199
you know uh

1738
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,759
bubba kush matt bubba he brought he him

1739
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,078
and josh d brought out bubba and that

1740
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,319
and a couple other strains from florida

1741
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:39,519
to uh uh

1742
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:41,920
a neighborhood out in l.a right

1743
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,199
and um they started growing some rooms

1744
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,519
of it

1745
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:48,719
yeah right and

1746
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:51,599
what happened i think in la is that

1747
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:54,159
la is such a is such a hype town

1748
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,480
and it's it's it's so about flash and

1749
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:59,519
it's so about like who has what

1750
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,039
whether it's alcohol or cars or watches

1751
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,159
or clothes or

1752
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,639
whatever

1753
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,000
that yeah kush caught on with a certain

1754
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,920
clientele

1755
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,079
and then everybody had to have it

1756
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,039
yeah and then so demand went through the

1757
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,000
roof

1758
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,599
and

1759
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,880
you know there was only so much of it

1760
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,079
being grown

1761
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,240
uh and so wholesale became crazy

1762
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,798
right yeah and then so it became worth a

1763
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,558
lot i mean what was what was uh

1764
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:28,719
you know what what was it going for back

1765
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,440
like 7200 yeah it was wholesale okay 68k

1766
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,159
yeah

1767
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,798
you know

1768
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:36,318
yeah six six to eight k right yeah and

1769
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:37,599
so and if and it gave you status if you

1770
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:40,400
had it

1771
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,000
right and so it just became this craze

1772
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,000
yeah in a sense and in the beginning

1773
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,760
there wasn't very many

1774
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,679
right yeah and

1775
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,280
the nature of la we've talked about this

1776
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:50,798
before with seed companies but the

1777
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,400
nature of la

1778
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:55,038
uh to everybody

1779
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,639
to pop up with their own [ __ ] nobody

1780
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,960
down there wanted to give anybody else

1781
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,159
credit for how they got theirs yeah of

1782
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,679
course so

1783
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:06,318
the [ __ ] and the and the stories

1784
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,919
started happening immediately yeah you

1785
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,000
know and the bubba just so everybody

1786
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,200
knows the bubba that that matt bubba

1787
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,440
brought out

1788
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,679
it died by 98.

1789
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,240
yeah the bubba that everybody has now is

1790
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:19,440
not the first bubba that came to

1791
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,719
came out there

1792
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,480
uh luckily bubba is is such a specific

1793
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,159
type and breed's so true it's probably

1794
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,159
something similar but yeah

1795
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,838
so i mean they found the i believe the

1796
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:31,598
story is it might even be somebody like

1797
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:34,480
rascal or somebody like that someone

1798
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:36,318

1804
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,359
well i think the thing is is that and i

1805
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:49,519
think that's why i got named bubba kush

1806
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:50,558
because they thought kush pollinated the

1807
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:52,239
bubba

1808
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,280
yeah i think matt bubba's story if i

1809
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,519
remember correctly

1810
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,760
he can correct me on this is that bubba

1811
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:00,639
is a hybrid bubba kush is a hybrid of

1812
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,640
bubba and og nog kush yes yeah so the

1813
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:05,519
original order lights so the original

1814
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:08,719
bubba that came out is no more yeah

1815
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:10,480
everybody has like everybody regardless

1816
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:12,000
of how you want to believe the story

1817
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,079
according to matt who brought it out

1818
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,880
they lost the first plant that they

1819
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:20,480
called bubba yes and bubba kush is a

1820
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,000
hybrid of that plant yeah

1821
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,960
right yeah

1822
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,760
yeah it's a hybrid that's kind of it and

1823
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,960
so to get really confusing

1824
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,960
within five or ten years of this plant

1825
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,199
hitting la

1826
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,280
there was a whole family of what you

1827
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:40,399
call purecush

1828
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,319

that there's

1844
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,480
all of a sudden the names start

1845
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,798
proliferating right yep to the point

1846
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,599
where i don't know by

1847
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:20,798
you know 0.050607

1848
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,960
um there was probably mo the clubs and

1849
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:26,239
it was so popular that probably most of

1850
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,639
what club sold in los angeles was kush

1851
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,399

1852
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,679
different kush's on the menu

1853
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,480
yeah

1854
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,159
and so we really don't know how many

1855
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,358
original things these things started

1856
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:40,639
from

1857
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:42,239
i mean we have a buddy uh that uh that

1858
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:44,000
came to uh

1859
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,399
um came to our one of our canned

1860
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,519
illuminati parties right remember and he

1861
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,358
was telling the story about about how

1862
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,599
he had bought a couple of pounds of kush

1863
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:54,400
for 8 000 bucks

1864
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,640
right

1865
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,160
and he brought it home and he starts

1866
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,400
breaking up the weed and a couple of

1867
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:02,558
seeds fall out yeah and then he's

1868
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,079
looking at two seeds

1869
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,440
from an eight thousand dollar pound that

1870
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,079
nobody can get

1871
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,358
yeah and so he spent the next two days

1872
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:13,839
looking at every bud for a seat

1873
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:17,279
and that became i think the poison o.g

1874
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:18,558
oh yeah casas yeah yeah yeah poison but

1875
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,640
that's what he said he said he bought

1876
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,319
two pounds for sixteen thousand bucks

1877
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,078
yes yeah and he goes dude i'm just

1878
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,558
rolling my first joint at home and i

1879
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,160
hear a seed hit the table and roll and

1880
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,440
i'm looking at this seed and i'm like i

1881
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:30,879
just spent

1882
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,838
eight grand a pound

1883
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,400
yeah wonder if there's more seeds

1884
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:39,279
what if the weed looks like this yeah

1885
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,639
and so every every seed you know and we

1886
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,280
have a good buddy

1887
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:46,639
um who got the kush

1888
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,720
in 99 we think right yeah yeah he's 99

1889
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:51,199
somewhere between 99. he's tied into

1890
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:53,838
some of the first people outside of

1891
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:56,159
outside of matt and josh d that got it

1892
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:58,159
yeah in los angeles and it was one of

1893
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:59,759
the guys mansion craze yeah and one of

1894
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:01,598
the guy and one one of the people

1895
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,880
intimately involved in running it very

1896
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,920
early on

1897
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,358
um and uh so we heard a lot of a lot of

1898
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,119
tales from him

1899
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:10,880
about uh

1900
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:13,039
sort of like how it spread and how it

1901
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,440
started and what it was like and

1902
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,760
the politics and the clubs

1903
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,280
right a lot of times clubs would name

1904
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,119
something

1905
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,480
because they wanted to be the only club

1906
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,400
with the louie

1907
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,000
or the only club with this and he has

1908
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,358
this funny story i can't tell it like

1909
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,039
him and he has a great accent i could

1910
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:32,078
never tell anything like that there was

1911
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,760
someone there was some armenian that you

1912
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,599
know he would always joke about and like

1913
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,079
he would be like let me give him a hug

1914
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,920
and he would be like 250

1915
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,760
000

1916
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:45,200
that's what he wanted for one rooted

1917
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,400
snip of his og that he had yeah right

1918
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,480
and uh

1919
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,000
you know and so

1920
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,358
um you know it's uh uh yeah but imagine

1921
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,920
paying eight thousand dollars a pound

1922
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:58,719
and you find it seated to him that just

1923
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,880
meant he was going to be able to grow

1924
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:04,078
some of those seeds yeah and grow his

1925
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,519
own 8 000 pounds yeah he was excited as

1926
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,920
all [ __ ] get out

1927
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:09,440
yeah you know he was stoked

1928
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,880
because that gave him away where it's

1929
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,559
like before it was like there was you

1930
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,039
think about the demand of l.a and how

1931
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:17,039
many people live in los angeles

1932
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,039
yeah and how much wealth there is and

1933
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,760
when there's only a few garages or a few

1934
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,920
rooms of these things cracking

1935
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,799
it goes [ __ ] lickety-split

1936
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,960
yeah

1937
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:29,920
yeah there's there's way more demand and

1938
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,760
so changed weed for from then on

1939
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,159
and so maybe we should maybe we should

1940
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,280
take a step back from the story because

1941
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:37,279
you know there's lots of people that

1942
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,640
like to talk specifics about the origins

1943
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,079
and how they're tied into it and all

1944
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:41,440
that [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah whatever

1945
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,119
specific cuts

1946
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,358
but what happened is is because that

1947
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,000
weed was worth so much money

1948
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,798
and because it became so popular in this

1949
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:54,159
area that had like 25 million humans

1950
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:56,639
yeah and it's sort of like a pop culture

1951
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:59,358
like you know melting pot for lack of a

1952
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:01,838
better term right yeah um

1953
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:03,759
[ __ ] blew up

1954
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:06,078
and then all of a sudden all these

1955
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,079
different names popped up and everyone

1956
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:10,880
wanted to have their own and then what

1957
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:14,000
that also started doing was because

1958
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,319
brokers could make more money off kush

1959
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,798
they started pushing all these people

1960
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:21,600
800 miles away in mendocino and humboldt

1961
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,679
and stuff county right yes to grow weed

1962
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,920
that they could make more money off

1963
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,000
yep and they didn't want

1964
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,239
i mean you know like my buddy who gave

1965
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,960
me the flowrider

1966
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:35,278
he didn't do it out of generosity

1967
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,838
he did it because i was giving him the

1968
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,400
superdog and the dog and the maui and

1969
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:42,079
the super skunk and different things

1970
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,920
and he had this kush that he could make

1971
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:44,798
way better margin on

1972
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,679
yeah

1973
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,039
so he was like give me that grow this he

1974
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,158
didn't tell me he was gonna make way

1975
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:51,920
more money

1976
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:53,920
yeah i didn't even know that that was

1977
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,719
the rake down there

1978
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,679
right yeah but what it did is it pushed

1979
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,838
a lot of people to start growing similar

1980
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,920
stuff to feed the market

1981
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:05,920
yeah and the purple the purple craze

1982
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,838
that we talked about before with caleb

1983
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,520
and all that that sort of started like

1984
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:11,519
the do you have this clone only and you

1985
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,279
better have it and if you have this

1986
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,400
specific clone only i'll buy all your

1987
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,319
wheat

1988
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,559
and if you don't it's going to be less

1989
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,039
and maybe maybe i will maybe i won't

1990
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,640
yeah right and kush was another wave

1991
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:25,359
just like that

1992
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,560
yeah you could sell every gram of kush

1993
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,560
you had

1994
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,080
and so brokers started going around and

1995
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,920
started trying to giving their i mean

1996
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:34,399
like who [ __ ] ghost

1997
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,239
right there was people that sold

1998
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,519
cuts of kush for thirty to fifty

1999
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,798
thousand hundred thousand two hundred

2000
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,880
thousand dollars

2001
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:42,319
yeah and people

2002
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,679
yeah because they could then they could

2003
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,798
fill rooms with it and it was like an

2004
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,600
investment

2005
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:49,359
yep there was violence over cush

2006
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,798
which is how the you know i mean i don't

2007
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,440
we don't really like to tell that story

2008
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,760
too much but it does seem like the what

2009
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,719
i call the 56 day headband

2010
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,880
yep

2011
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,119
started out name named something else in

2012
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,560
the cush crew yeah and there was some

2013
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:04,479
stress and some violence and some

2014
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,920
whatever and they fled the they fled to

2015
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,599
the bay

2016
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,119
and they wanted to call it something

2017
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,840
else so they didn't get in trouble for

2018
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:12,800
it

2019
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,600
yep and they chose the name headband

2020
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,679
right

2021
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,960
uh you know and then

2022
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,719
you know there's a lot of people that oh

2023
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,920
well what what cut we should talk about

2024
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,880
this too

2025
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,640
i firmly believe that the cut that josh

2026
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,279
brought to

2027
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,039
la first with matt

2028
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:30,960
it's really hard to figure out the

2029
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,880
lineage

2030
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,079
what do you mean as far as like what's

2031
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,760
actually in it yeah there's a bunch of

2032
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,039
people that think when they get ghost

2033
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,560
that that's it

2034
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,560
yeah oh yeah yeah there's a bunch of

2035
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,159
people that think when they get 92 og

2036
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,800
that that's it there's a bunch of people

2037
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,960
that think that they pop josh d og seeds

2038
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,960
that it's but forget about that one for

2039
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,359
a minute i'm just saying

2040
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,920
some people think sfv

2041
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:57,439
some people think josh some people think

2042
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:59,920
ghost some people think 92 right someone

2043
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:01,919
mentioned that earlier again you know

2044
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,000
um and our buddy said he doesn't think

2045
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,279
any of those are it

2046
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,840
yeah

2047
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,960
right yeah so what happened in la is

2048
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,000
everybody came up with all these

2049
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,079
different names it's not even like

2050
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,840
there's one sfe there's a few that float

2051
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:16,238
around oh yeah

2052
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,159
there's not just one there's not one top

2053
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:21,119
oh not one larry yeah for sure there's

2054
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:23,119
multiples so what you consider is like

2055
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:25,039
sfv is it

2056
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,640
there might have been one time when when

2057
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:28,560
it was called it but a lot of what's

2058
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,560
currently circulated right now is that

2059
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,280
isn't it yeah

2060
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,520
and some of the people that bought ghost

2061
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:37,679
off ghosts like 20 years ago for high

2062
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,480
dollar they don't think the ghost cut is

2063
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,840
it

2064
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:41,919
let's get passed around that's not what

2065
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,760
they got 20 years ago

2066
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,760
well the guy that goes around his ghost

2067
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,079
now that people talk about is not the

2068
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,159
same ghost that had the cut and traded

2069
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:51,760
with oregon kid from michigan most

2070
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:53,920
people confused this cali guy with the

2071
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,719
original guy yeah there's a lot of first

2072
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,800
go

2073
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,960
the ghost cut right now isn't the first

2074
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,880
ghost cut and what everybody knows is

2075
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,719
ghost grow isn't the first ghost that

2076
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,319
passed the ghost cut who now lives in

2077
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,079
the midwest again

2078
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,319
yeah i don't even know if ghost grows

2079
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:11,119
the same one as the one that was going

2080
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:12,719
around calling himself callie kush farms

2081
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,000
that wasn't the michigan ghost the

2082
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,920
michigan ghost

2083
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,760
i talked to one of his buddies and he

2084
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,520
has to be put back in touch with oregon

2085
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,199
kid and that's the first time i realized

2086
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,880
that the ghost that was kind of hanging

2087
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:25,439
around oregon kid wasn't the same ghost

2088
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,880
that passed the cut so i put him back in

2089
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,799
touch but i don't know what happened

2090
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,319
from there so people are people are

2091
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,560
ripping through the stories or whatever

2092
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,799
right and it's because

2093
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,640
the first people that the first people

2094
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,320
that brought it out sometimes with

2095
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,600
certain strains you lose chain of

2096
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:41,519
custody

2097
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,560
yeah you know i mean there was an issue

2098
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,800
where

2099
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,320
freaking uh you know

2100
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,400
i don't think josh will get too mad if i

2101
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:50,960
say this but like josh lost the cut in

2102
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:53,279
an accident and none of his friends in

2103
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,359
l.a wanted to give it back to him

2104
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:57,119
and he had another story and he had to

2105
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:59,198
go to a friend in the bay that he had

2106
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:00,479
stashed it with to get it back

2107
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:03,119
yeah

2108
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,718
right yeah and that's typical weed yeah

2109
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:06,000
because people were like oh it didn't

2110
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,079
even matter that he was the guy that

2111
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,079
they got it from it was profit

2112
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:12,640
yeah oh a lot of these original guys

2113
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,679
that had it they lost it right

2114
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,600
and

2115
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,880
um and there's an aspect where it's like

2116
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,480
and i don't mean i'm not saying that

2117
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,800
like people have fake ghosts what i'm

2118
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:23,919
saying is is that there's four or five

2119
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,199
cuts out there that all claim to be

2120
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,239
the cut

2121
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:30,000
that matt and josh brought to l.a that's

2122
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,919
yeah exactly and they're different and

2123
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,679
those cuts if you grow them side by side

2124
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,119
they're not the same cut

2125
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,560
yeah

2126
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,079
like i don't and i don't mean like not

2127
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,239
the same cut that they first brought i

2128
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:43,039

what you know and nobody called 92 92

2132
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,158
yeah that that's a more recent

2133
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,158
adaptation to the name that's a more

2134
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:58,319
recent adaptation the first name there

2135
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:00,079
was no going back to like when it was

2136
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,119

2137
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:04,719
one called it 92. yeah

2138
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:06,319
that came later

2139
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,439
yeah you know

2140
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:08,799
and so

2141
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:10,960
you know we don't people don't know i

2142
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,320
don't know if the 92 hollywood hills cut

2143
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,319
is the same as the flowrider

2144
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,679
could the flowrider be the exact same

2145
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:22,319
cut that josh brought out to california

2146
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,679
to la it could

2147
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:26,079
i don't know

2148
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,480
yeah you know i got that one early but i

2149
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:30,079
didn't get the josh cut early

2150
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,759
and i didn't get it with provenance that

2151
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,119
i would know for sure

2152
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,440
yeah

2153
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:38,079
huh i see people keep asking about the

2154
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:39,759
suge knight and the kush war that story

2155
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:41,439
is a bag of worms that no one wants to

2156
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,440
touch because nobody has any facts

2157
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,399
really around it so i'll leave it alone

2158
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,079
but yeah

2159
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:49,039
there's rumors going around that they

2160
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:50,960
might have some relation and one

2161
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,198
the one that you think would came first

2162
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:58,319
might not be the one that actually

2163
01:14:53,198 --> 01:15:00,319
is the first one between the two yeah

2164
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:01,359
you know so so there's a lot there's

2165
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:03,039
basically

2166
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:05,039
i bet there's a bunch of people that

2167
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,600
have different named ogs out there that

2168
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:08,479
are the same og

2169
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,480
and

2170
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,759
one guys one guy's larry could be

2171
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:16,079
another guy's sfv could be another guy

2172
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,920
yeah right because these names became

2173
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:19,679
interchangeable and then you start

2174
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,000
adding names and then you start getting

2175
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:25,760
louie and fire and

2176
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,600
you know diablo and yeah and da da da da

2177
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,880
then there's all the pure cush names and

2178
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,199
all those riffs and then there's the

2179
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:34,159
master cushes and two or three of the

2180
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:36,238
master cushes look like bubba kush's

2181
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:38,559
yeah and one of them that i used to have

2182
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:39,678
was tall and lanky and dark and very

2183
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,719
stringy

2184
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,480
i still think

2185
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,158
two dogs i still think two dog has the

2186
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,879
[ __ ] socal master every time i see it

2187
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:48,559
it looks exactly like it hell's angels

2188
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,760
and then people say that

2189
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,600
you know that yeah you could you could

2190
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,520
probably name and there was probably a

2191
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,079
10-year period where like you could walk

2192
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,239
into a club and they would have 20 25

2193
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,760
different names on the menu of cush

2194
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:01,119
yeah

2195
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,840
right oh

2196
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:06,719
yeah some some collectors out here were

2197
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,480
only ogs and that was their [ __ ] like we

2198
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:11,198

2199
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,879
list of like 40 different og's yeah and

2200
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:14,479
what's funny is that you know [ __ ]

2201
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,920
dude ghost girl or whatever he rages

2202
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:17,599
because there's people in la that their

2203
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,800
entire career has just been learning how

2204
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,440
to grow kush

2205
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,480
yeah and selling it for high dollar

2206
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:27,519
yeah and it had such a long successful

2207
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:29,678
popular run before things changed

2208
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,600
that some people's entire careers have

2209
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,800
just been cropping kush

2210
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:37,120
yeah

2211
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:38,960
you know um but there's no like there's

2212
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,359
so there's this aspect where because

2213
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,800
it's one of the most famous families of

2214
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:45,198
weed out there

2215
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,520
yeah there's a bunch of origin stories

2216
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:49,359
and there's a bunch of claims and

2217
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,840
probably most of the cuts that came out

2218
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:52,880
of la are bad seat

2219
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,199
yeah

2220
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,640
one would think

2221
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:58,079
and then sometimes that's what i've

2222
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,360
always thought and then sometimes a

2223
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:01,119
different crew would get it and they'd

2224
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:03,679
throw a different name on it yeah or

2225
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:05,279
just renames in bag seeds yeah

2226
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:06,960
yeah and then you know i mean i like

2227
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,960
josh or whatever but josh did the stupid

2228
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,399
[ __ ] thing where he took

2229
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,920
he took like

2230
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:15,359
uh what

2231
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:17,199
h-a-o-g and something else and something

2232
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:19,359
and crossed it all together and then

2233
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:21,439
called it original josh d

2234
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:24,158
no that was karma who did that

2235
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:26,639
that was karma yeah it was karma's doing

2236
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:29,359
not not just yeah oh god well then yeah

2237
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,280
karma can suck it uh yeah because

2238
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:32,399
because there's an obvious play to tie

2239
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:34,238
it to

2240
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:37,519
yeah you know yeah use like triangle

2241
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:42,158
kush and oh yeah oh g and and h-a-o-g

2242
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:44,480
and something else and d-obs yeah yeah

2243
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,839

2282
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,480

01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,119
um

2284
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,959

he was told anything more than og and it

2288
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,359
was fire so he called it fire og that

2289
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:14,000
was it and then later on um swerve made

2290
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:17,039
a cross of fire og and something else

2291
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,800
more correctly and called it raskology

2292
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:21,519
yeah and so it's one of those things

2293
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,719
that one of the biggest things about og

2294
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,679
is that og og and sauer but especially

2295
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,760
og

2296
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:31,199
are is probably one of the first strains

2297
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:33,520
that like it just dominated breeding and

2298
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,879
hybrids for so long

2299
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,000
yeah

2300
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,840
you know and what's interesting is like

2301
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,119
for a long time

2302
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,960
maybe we should talk about this for a

2303
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:45,439
second but for a long time

2304
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,279
um people would work ogs and they would

2305
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:48,000
breed with ogs that they would s one

2306
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:49,198
them

2307
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,880
and

2308
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:52,399
kind of the best pheno would be the one

2309
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,279
that looked like mom

2310
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:55,119
yeah

2311
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,359
right yep it was really weird it was

2312
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,439
like you wouldn't find a bunch of [ __ ]

2313
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:02,238
and uh the good ones would be the ones

2314
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:06,719
that look exactly like the parent

2315
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:09,119
and then caleb uh reversed the tk

2316
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:11,039
and he got a much wider variety of cool

2317
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:14,158
phenos

2318
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:16,319
yeah and he found ghost in there and he

2319
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:18,799
found he found ones that looked like a

2320
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:21,119
lot of popular ones and that's that's

2321
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:24,079
like one of those ways for a breeder if

2322
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:27,519
you're a breeder to know that you have

2323
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:30,479
like uh you have a mother type situation

2324
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:32,320
of a bunch of other cuts is when you s1

2325
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:34,158
it and you're seeing all those sister

2326
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:35,198
and brother phenos popping out of what

2327
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:37,119
you just

2328
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:39,198
made and that's how you kind of get the

2329
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,559
idea that triangle might be the

2330
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:43,359
predecessor

2331
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:45,360
so it's it's interesting because if if

2332
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:46,719
you know if there was bag seed and there

2333
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,439
was multiple

2334
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,960
cush strains found in that bag seed

2335
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:53,039
yeah then the initial bag seed would

2336
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:56,000
probably be a hybrid maybe

2337
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:57,840
right uh and you know it seems like

2338
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,760
there's there's at least one maybe a few

2339
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,159
cushions out there that throw much wider

2340
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,079
phenos than most of them yeah so it

2341
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,000
almost leads it it almost leads you to

2342
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,840
believe that a lot of these cushes are

2343
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,079
lucky bag seats

2344
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,960
yeah that people found and named but

2345
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:14,880
because it's an s-1 of kush already

2346
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,000
it kind of looks like itself for the

2347
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,520
most part

2348
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,158
yeah it's one of the it's one of the

2349
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:23,199
reasons why caleb and i believe that the

2350
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:26,079
chem dog the 91 itself might be an s1

2351
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:27,198
yeah because it throws such a narrow

2352
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:29,039
band

2353
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:30,960
yeah of phenos

2354
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:32,560
like there's a bunch of there's a bunch

2355
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,760
of physically it doesn't look very

2356
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,239
different

2357
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,159
um potency-wise it can vary

2358
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:39,919
quite a bit in some flavor

2359
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:41,599
but there's a really narrow band of

2360
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,560
physical expression

2361
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,639
yeah and a lot of cushions are like that

2362
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,760
yeah probably because they're backseat

2363
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,600
yeah

2364
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:53,440
you know and it's also interesting too

2365
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:55,360
that like um you know i mean the

2366
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:59,039
the two of the most famous strains out

2367
01:21:55,359 --> 01:22:01,839
there um the kush and the sour diesel

2368
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,119
neither one of them reversed very easily

2369
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,159
yeah

2370
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:07,119
a lot of failure with those

2371
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:09,920
right

2372
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:12,000
yep yeah they suck they suck so a lot of

2373
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,520
times a lot of times things get reversed

2374
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,960
onto them

2375
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,480
yeah

2376
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,158
you know that's that's usually how it

2377
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:20,399
goes the only

2378
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:23,119
the only real ogs i'm seeing people like

2379
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:24,399
regularly reverse or og hybrids and they

2380
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:26,158
they have to get lucky and find

2381
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,158
something that'll reverse well but most

2382
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:30,079
of these old og cuts be it you know bad

2383
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:33,279
seats and back seats and we're finding

2384
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:35,840
that like s2s s3s [ __ ] like that doesn't

2385
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,399
reverse well for whatever reason it's

2386
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,960
really hard to reverse like a multiple

2387
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,399
self or multiple backseat generations

2388
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,560
and that makes sense for og it makes

2389
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:46,399
sense for a lot of these ogs

2390
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,560
you know so it's like yeah they they

2391
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:50,879
ended up getting outcrossed

2392
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,039
and then people would would reverse some

2393
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,639
of them looking for better [ __ ] and the

2394
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:55,920
best [ __ ] that they would find was the

2395
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,039
[ __ ] that looked like the [ __ ] they

2396
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,399
already had

2397
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:01,600
yeah

2398
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:03,439
and i got kind of over og because while

2399
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,880
i think it is an amazing strain and i'm

2400
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:07,439
not here trying to dis it or anything

2401
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,119
like that i don't think that its genetic

2402
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:11,759
expression is wide enough that you would

2403
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,519
need to keep 20 different ones yeah and

2404
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,360
you're like this one's earthy this one's

2405
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,199
lemony this one has a slight hint of

2406
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:18,719
this this one's more tennis balls this

2407
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:21,439
one's darker

2408
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:24,000
you know yeah uh look at that matt

2409
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,279
someone wants you to s1 the hogs breath

2410
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,520
yeah i've done it before i'll do it

2411
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:29,039
again i haven't i haven't i haven't run

2412
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,480
it again once it started getting past i

2413
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:32,639
dropped it so somebody asked an

2414
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:35,439
interesting question why does s2 and s3

2415
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:38,239
and all that get harder um because what

2416
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:40,479
happens is is you're selfing so there's

2417
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:43,359
only one set of genes and so every time

2418
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:45,359
you self you increase the propensity of

2419
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:47,039
recessive traits that are negative to be

2420
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,839
able to pop

2421
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:52,399
yeah right and so the deeper you go into

2422
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,920
selfing the more narrower you're putting

2423
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,679
the genetic pool

2424
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,960
yeah and that's when issues start

2425
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,840
happening

2426
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,920
that's why there's rules against injury

2427
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,520
for humans you're not allowed to bang

2428
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,840
your sister or your first cousin doesn't

2429
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:09,679
go well or your mom or your uncle or you

2430
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:12,319
let me tell you from personal experience

2431
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:13,840
yeah that [ __ ] sucks bro yeah i mean it

2432
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:14,960
took out the whole royal families of

2433
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,760
europe

2434
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,920
yeah

2435
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,600
they needed some outcrossing

2436
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,560
yeah they kept selfing essentially

2437
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,320
almost yeah so that's why and then and

2438
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,920
then you know as things get as things

2439
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:30,399
get more narrow a lot of times s3 s4

2440
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,319
it starts getting a lot weaker

2441
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:33,920
it starts getting a lot more prone to

2442
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:36,319
lack of vigor

2443
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,119
stress other aspects

2444
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:40,158
and there's a lot of regular breeding

2445
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:42,399
um

2446
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:46,479
there's a lot of regular breeding that

2447
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:48,879
uses selfing successfully but it does

2448
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:51,119
in normal agriculture absolutely selfing

2449
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,079
is a massively used technique with great

2450
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:54,479
success

2451
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:57,600
yeah in cannabis it seems to have

2452
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:59,678
negative connotations taken

2453
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,520
maybe maybe people have a different idea

2454
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,199
but for me at least

2455
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:05,120
what it seems like selfing the biggest

2456
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:07,039
thing is is because most of the things

2457
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:09,279
that we have are our

2458
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:11,840
individual cuts and not seed lines

2459
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:14,000
anymore yeah it allows you to see what

2460
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,000
else is in the genetics besides that one

2461
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,960
expression yes

2462
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,359
you know if if if you had you know a

2463
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,439
hundred seeds of what og kush came out

2464
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:24,639
of and it was males and females you'd

2465
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:27,839
have a line

2466
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:30,159
yeah but if you have a cut

2467
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,159
then how do you how do you see what it

2468
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:33,839
is pure not outcrossed

2469
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:36,238
yeah

2470
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,319
so a lot of times i mean caleb talks all

2471
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,079
the time like if people are looking for

2472
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:41,119
consistency in

2473
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,279
in um

2474
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:44,800
in seed then the way to go is some of

2475
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:46,399
his outcrosses

2476
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,279
yeah a lot of the um

2477
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:51,759
the the feminized hybrids yeah well

2478
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:54,079
feminized hybrids

2479
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,800
if you're looking for specific phenos

2480
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:58,719
but you're willing to tolerate more junk

2481
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,639
yeah go to the s once

2482
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,239
yeah but the s1s are going to have a

2483
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,000
certain amount of recessive stuff in

2484
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,799
there that's undesirable

2485
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,359
yeah does it bread with itself

2486
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,520
so the outcrosses you know urkel

2487
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:14,399
reversed onto kush would will be more

2488
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,480
consistent than urkel onto urkel

2489
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,719
that's why again why like when i talk

2490
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:20,000
about the blue bonnet and despite what

2491
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,000
was said about it that it was a pure

2492
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,840
blueberry line i still think to this day

2493
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,840
that it's hybrid because all those

2494
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,880
recessive traits that blueberry usually

2495
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,960
carries

2496
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,480
when you further inbreed it are gone

2497
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,239
completely erased

2498
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:34,559
and i talked before about how i didn't

2499
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:36,559
like the the pure blue lines very much

2500
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,480
at all yeah yeah um but then you

2501
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,480
outcross them to different other amazing

2502
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:42,399
things and those kids

2503
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:44,399
came out way better than the parent in

2504
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:46,559
my opinion exactly and i think it just

2505
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:49,439
it's i think it was massive inbreeding

2506
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:52,639
going on in such a small environment and

2507
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:54,479
the constant crossing of two uh two

2508
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:56,800
distinctly different

2509
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:58,559
expressions like crossing indica to

2510
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,079
sativa or whatever

2511
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,520
most people don't breathe like that they

2512
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:04,238
breed in a direction most people don't

2513
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,920
keep constantly in crossing two

2514
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:07,919
different types through generations and

2515
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,520
that that caused a weird inbreeding to

2516
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,760
go on and and

2517
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:15,199
and not all the best traits to be a

2518
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:17,360
parent dj is really unusual dude

2519
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:20,238
because if you believe in what he says

2520
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:24,238
he basically took four plants

2521
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:26,158
and never added anything else yeah yeah

2522
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:27,599
and everything that he has comes from

2523
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,599
those four plants

2524
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,039
yeah right it was like a

2525
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:35,920
oregon purple tie and a juicy fruit tie

2526
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:38,079
and an anime and an afghani yeah and

2527
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,840
maybe something else or that's it

2528
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:42,399
the the the oregon purple thai was

2529
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,199
chocolate thai wahawk and gold so

2530
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:45,198
yeah

2531
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:47,119
yeah okay count those two

2532
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:49,439
if you count those two it's four

2533
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,519
yeah exactly you know and then a lot of

2534
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:52,479
times all those things were only used

2535
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,840
once

2536
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,238
according to him

2537
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,400
never never back crossed to again or

2538
01:27:56,238 --> 01:28:01,599
reintroduced and he just lied and he

2539
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:02,399
just worked within the lines yeah and so

2540
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,400
you know

2541
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:06,719
uh camara has talked about how he kind

2542
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:08,479
of views all of dj's stuff as this big

2543
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,800
mangled

2544
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:12,399
inbred specific thing

2545
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,719
yeah but at least that's cool because

2546
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:17,198
you never mixed anything else into it

2547
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:20,390
yeah but that's really unusual

2548
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:22,399
it is it's everything about how he made

2549
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:25,840
[Laughter]

2550
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:28,719
i i agree like i spent i spent several

2551
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:31,679
thousand dollars on those specific seeds

2552
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:34,000
and i had to really work to find

2553
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:35,199
things that were good blueberry terps

2554
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,520
because that just wasn't what i was

2555
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:40,879
seeing in the line i told you i ran 400

2556
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:44,000
and 450 of four of his lines yeah you

2557
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,279
know and uh i wish i was bragging about

2558
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,960
keepers

2559
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,399
yeah but you know like i wouldn't have

2560
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,920
loop on it without those lines so

2561
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,439
there's great potential in those lines

2562
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,359
but i think like you said it's it's in

2563
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,960
the hybridization i really do it's in

2564
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:56,639
the hybridization you know it's kind of

2565
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,880
like that thing with like you know the

2566
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:01,359
closest thing that we have to uh to an

2567
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,600
actual ibl people throw around ibl all

2568
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:05,279
the time it drives yeah nine nuts yeah

2569
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,600
ibl's

2570
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:08,880
yeah right because an ibl is essentially

2571
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,039
something that's been bred so

2572
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,239
consistently that it just is what it is

2573
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:13,519
yeah it is what it is everything's

2574
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,279
looking like clones of each other from

2575
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,639
science and everything looks like clones

2576
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,559
of each other so if you have some kind

2577
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:21,279
of ideal where you're trying to grow

2578
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,560
fields of exact replicas it might be a

2579
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:25,279
good tech

2580
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:26,880
if you want to breed all of the genetic

2581
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:28,238
diversity out of your [ __ ] and

2582
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,840
everything that you cross with it is

2583
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,638
going to look like it

2584
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,360
yeah

2585
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:35,679
then you know [ __ ]

2586
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:38,880
yeah you know but i mean that that that

2587
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:40,639
88 g13 hash plant kind of throws

2588
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,679
phenols that are just like it

2589
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,840
yeah

2590
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,600
junk you cross things the jeep chunk and

2591
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,840
it's very deep chunkish

2592
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,920
yeah yeah well though gene did point out

2593
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,400
that like there are so

2594
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,639
i when i refer to ibl's i do think a

2595
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,399
deep chunk because visually it is it is

2596
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:59,520
very uniform i mean there's like two

2597
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:00,879
phenos like two uh uh

2598
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,760
visually

2599
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:06,400
expressive phenos that look

2600
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,320
distinct but when you smoke it some have

2601
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:09,119
a much better hive than the others so

2602
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:11,198
true

2603
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:13,279
and that i i when i was speaking about

2604
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,439
it i was only speaking visually when it

2605
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:17,359
when in fact a true ibl would be for all

2606
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,519
traits across the board but that's why

2607
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:22,000
it drives matt and i nuts because there

2608
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,840
are no ibl's in cannabis yeah you just

2609
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,079
can't but

2610
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,560
and so an ibl is basically something

2611
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,800
that breeds true for all traits

2612
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,280
yeah and all the seeds are going to be

2613
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:36,159
very narrow within that tiny little band

2614
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:38,719
yeah you can have a true breeding stream

2615
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:40,719
that's only true breeding for one trait

2616
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,880
yeah like the bonnet it's true breeding

2617
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:44,960
for blueberry terps and that's it

2618
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,480
right or you know you could have you

2619
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,399
could have something like skunk one

2620
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:51,119
that's true breeding for

2621
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:53,679
you know improving calyx to leaf ratio

2622
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:56,319
or you know bud structure or this or

2623
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:57,679
that but it has a variety of terps or

2624
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:59,920
you know things in it

2625
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:02,319
you know so true breeding

2626
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:04,079
and ibl is like the furthest example of

2627
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:06,000
true breeding it's like when all the

2628
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:07,119
characteristics are the same

2629
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,198
yeah

2630
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:11,439
and true breeding is just one or more of

2631
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:13,119
the characteristics you can count on

2632
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:15,198
seeing in the progeny

2633
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:16,719
yeah so when someone the other day i

2634
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:19,279
can't recall who it was it was i think

2635
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,760
it was a lady was saying that um

2636
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:23,198
that they have an f2 ibl and people are

2637
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,880
like what the [ __ ] that doesn't make any

2638
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:26,638
sense and that lady was like no it makes

2639
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,039
sense it doesn't make sense to have an

2640
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,400
f2 ibo it's not possible no and so

2641
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:33,439
there's a lot of terms that are thrown

2642
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:35,198
around ibl is the worst one because yeah

2643
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:37,359
um you should be able to buy a hundred

2644
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:38,799
seeds of an ibl and see less than two

2645
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:41,119
percent variation

2646
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,520
yeah and i think i think uh what where

2647
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:45,840
the miscommunication is is that a line

2648
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,320
being inbred is not the same thing as an

2649
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,159
inbred line and line breeding is not the

2650
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:53,279
same thing as an ibl

2651
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:56,238
you know ibl so specific and line

2652
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:59,519
breeding and in breeding in a line

2653
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:01,599
don't denote an ivl it is a process to

2654
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,280
getting towards an ivl but i think

2655
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,800
that's where a lot of confusion lies

2656
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:08,719
yeah if there's if there's a bunch of

2657
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,840
variation of of any traits at all in

2658
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,719
your lead it's not an ibl

2659
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,600
yeah

2660
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,679
you know

2661
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,920
ibl's is basically a way to in

2662
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,440
agriculture to grow clones of each other

2663
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,279
from seed stock

2664
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:23,279
yeah that's its goal

2665
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,800
yeah so you know if you're gonna grow an

2666
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:25,759
ibl for weed it's like you're gonna

2667
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,600
breed

2668
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,800
all the cool [ __ ] out of it and it's not

2669
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,079
going to be worth breeding with once

2670
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,199
it's an ibl

2671
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:32,800
for the most part because it's going to

2672
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:35,039
have such a narrow range it's going to

2673
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,880
make everything look like itself

2674
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:39,039
yeah and so hope you know so if you made

2675
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,159
an ibl maybe it would be just you know

2676
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:41,600
if it was something that was just so

2677
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:42,719
incredible but it'd probably be a bunch

2678
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,400
of words

2679
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,600
yeah it'd probably be a bunch of work

2680
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:46,559
and it would suck

2681
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,039
yeah

2682
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:50,800
you know realistically speaking and it's

2683
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:53,359
in in cannabis another reason it's very

2684
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,800
hard to to make ibl's is because males

2685
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,198
express different than females even if

2686
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,480
they are the same expression males are

2687
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:01,198
even if they're the same

2688
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:02,718
uh general phenotype they the male

2689
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:04,238
always grows taller than the female so

2690
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:05,198
they don't look identical so trying to

2691
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:07,759
choose

2692
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:09,919
the male expression of a female line

2693
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,920
that you want to find is very [ __ ]

2694
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,840
hard to do you know that's why it's much

2695
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,880
easier and faster to do it through

2696
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,239
selfing

2697
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,520
and there's an aspect too where someone

2698
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:19,359
was like well what if you just picked a

2699
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:22,320
really good plant to ibl

2700
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:24,719
that's assuming that all those traits

2701
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:26,479
will be the dominant trait yeah the more

2702
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,399
that you breathe and breed into itself

2703
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:31,119
and you're not going to lose them

2704
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:33,119
by inbreeding yeah

2705
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:35,359
you know um

2706
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:37,119
you know so so there's an aspect there

2707
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,719
where it's like it someone just said

2708
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:40,158
that's a good question i missed whatever

2709
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:41,840
the question was yeah i was trying to

2710
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:43,439
look for it just now i don't know if

2711
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,719
matt if you can find it or someone wants

2712
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:46,479
to uh

2713
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,760
you know um

2714
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:51,359
the whole thing there is no cubed term

2715
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,960
the only [ __ ] that ever used the

2716
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:57,279
term cute like like the c99 really cube

2717
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:00,158
that was a mr soul thing yeah that was

2718
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:02,000
sort of his his own terminology for he

2719
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:03,519
still has his and he even after this

2720
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
like he still has his [ __ ] training

2721
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:08,400
wheels he needs to slow down oh my god

2722
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,319
but yeah there's no cubing was just like

2723
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:13,198
he found some bag seed and he started

2724
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:14,079
inbreeding it to itself a bunch

2725
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,479
you know

2726
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:18,880
um which was already probably inbred but

2727
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:19,919
yeah

2728
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,800
it's like

2729
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,158
you know

2730
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,840
one of the reasons why they don't want

2731
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,839
you to bang your sister

2732
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,840
um is because the [ __ ] that happens to

2733
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,760
you when you start breeding humans too

2734
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,159
close is a lot of

2735
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,239
mental issues physical issues various

2736
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:37,198
kinds of things start popping up that in

2737
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:40,158
normal humans are never dominant

2738
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:43,359
yeah but if you inbreed enough you can

2739
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:45,198
combine those two not dominant genes and

2740
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:46,719
it'll pop dominant

2741
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:49,359
oh you

2742
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:51,039
that question he said what about this

2743
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:53,279
isn't a real question what about

2744
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:55,039
recombinant and red line like tony green

2745
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:56,719
and gg4rio

2746
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:59,600
i can't even answer that like without

2747
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:01,118
laughing stop guys please

2748
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,520
you know and i think that's a guy who

2749
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:05,439
who is talking [ __ ] about uh caleb and

2750
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,119
said he was at like f12 or something

2751
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:08,960
[ __ ] nothing

2752
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:10,799
there's an aspect where it's like let's

2753
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:13,118
let's let's be honest it's like there's

2754
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,600
a lot of there's a lot of terms that get

2755
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:17,519
loosely applied to cannabis yeah and

2756
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,039
they're not that well understood and

2757
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:21,280
it's not anybody's fault because it's

2758
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:23,198
not like there's seminars on this [ __ ]

2759
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:25,198
and a lot of information gets passed

2760
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:26,638
through friendships

2761
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:28,799
and a lot of times some of those

2762
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:31,520
friendships like aren't passing the most

2763
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,639
reliable information about things

2764
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,679
yeah

2765
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,319
right

2766
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,600
yeah you know that's what it is

2767
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:39,519
they're hoping that people don't know

2768
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,360
what the term means and it sounds like

2769
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,520
they've done work if they put stupid-ass

2770
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,679
terms at the end of it f12 like if you

2771
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,480
really think that some dude that's been

2772
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:50,079
around not that long is it f12 then you

2773
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:51,759
do not understand breeding or how long

2774
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:53,439
it takes to make it through generations

2775
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,880
and to do real breeding to make sure

2776
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:56,479
that generation is correct and if you've

2777
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,079
made an error to go back to the previous

2778
01:35:56,479 --> 01:35:59,759
generation keep working because you're

2779
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:02,639
never going to hit it right 12 times in

2780
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,880
a row guaranteed so implying that he has

2781
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,800
worked something like 12 generations is

2782
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,079
asinine to people actually do that and

2783
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,079
there's friends of ours that are

2784
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:11,519
breeders that are like dude i had this

2785
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:13,118
awesome line

2786
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,760
and then i did this thing to it and i

2787
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:17,519
didn't end up keeping enough seed from

2788
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,920
before i did that thing

2789
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,800
yeah and then i [ __ ] it up yeah i

2790
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,639
didn't

2791
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,639
get rid of it to get rid of that seed

2792
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:26,639
and go one to two gens back and go in a

2793
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:29,199
different direction but i didn't keep

2794
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:31,118
the seed and i [ __ ] it up and it's not

2795
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:33,439
as good as it was before and i can't

2796
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:35,039
make it the way it was before because i

2797
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:38,158
didn't keep that gem

2798
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:40,319
so it's basically like a misstep

2799
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:42,799
yeah right you can make a mistake

2800
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:44,639
if you don't save if you don't save seed

2801
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,920
from every single rip

2802
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:49,359
you know and when people say f2 f3 f4 i

2803
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,440
mean what that means is that you're

2804
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:53,599
supposed to grow up a bunch of seed

2805
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,919
pick males and females

2806
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,239
right that exhibit traits that you want

2807
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,840
cross them and then breed them

2808
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:01,439
okay here's a question and i'm going to

2809
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,119
address it just because me and me and

2810
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:04,319
csi were talking about like an hour ago

2811
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,439
right right before we started this

2812
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:10,319
anyways um but is crossing an elite to

2813
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:11,118
an elite breeding or pollen chucking

2814
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:13,359
i

2815
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:16,158
consider regular breeding like using a

2816
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:18,479
male i consider that vacation and taking

2817
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:20,799
days off like that is the easiest [ __ ]

2818
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:22,479
to do you don't have to do anything you

2819
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,159
just they they make their seeds

2820
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:26,638
themselves you don't have you have to

2821
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:28,479
shake it around that's about it um

2822
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:32,319
breeding using

2823
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:33,839
reversal techniques is a lot more

2824
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:36,719
involved

2825
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:38,159
it's it's a lot more unpredictable um

2826
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,000
you can make a lot more errors a lot

2827
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,238
real fast i mean you could you could

2828
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,279
take something and isolate it and and

2829
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:45,279
make it

2830
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:47,679
more true breeding really fast but you

2831
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:50,479
can also make huge errors right away and

2832
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,760
very rarely does a pollination go where

2833
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:54,158
you can just like hit something and

2834
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,679
shake it in a reversal and the seeds

2835
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:57,519
make themselves that just doesn't really

2836
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:58,960
happen that often a lot of times you

2837
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,040
have to get in there with

2838
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,960
[ __ ] tweezers tweeze out each one

2839
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:04,560
shake the [ __ ] pollen out half of

2840
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,760
that [ __ ] won't be good and it's just

2841
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,000
because that's

2842
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,400
that's how it goes you know so there's

2843
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,639
an aspect too which i should mention uh

2844
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:14,399
and that's the reason why matt said

2845
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:16,880
you're not gonna do 12

2846
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:18,559
12 readings that all make sense

2847
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,159
and what he means by that is that let's

2848
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:23,199
say you're at f3 and you grew up a bunch

2849
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:24,960
of f3s and you're ready to make your f4s

2850
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:26,238
and then you realize that you don't like

2851
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,079
that combo

2852
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,638
yeah and you want to go back one

2853
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:32,880
generation earlier and try again

2854
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:35,359
yeah because you didn't like

2855
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,400
that selection so yeah you're like in

2856
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:40,639
order to get to f12 that means 12 times

2857
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:42,719
you would have to grow up seeds

2858
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:45,039
like what you see pick

2859
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,560
females and males of each one

2860
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:48,399
cross them together

2861
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,560
grow up their children and just keep

2862
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:52,960
doing that and every single time every

2863
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,639
single f gen you're like [ __ ] yeah i won

2864
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,319
yeah [ __ ] yeah i'm good where a lot of

2865
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,679
times you're gonna get somewhere and be

2866
01:38:56,319 --> 01:39:00,079
like oh that went in direction i don't

2867
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:03,118
like that nearly as much as the f4

2868
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:06,719
this f5 sucks i gotta go back to f4

2869
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:09,359
again i i did a green craft bx1

2870
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:11,359
and i i you know i was one of the early

2871
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:13,359
growers and breeders with green crack i

2872
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:15,039
love that [ __ ] strain i don't know

2873
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:16,238
why it's just nice and mangoey and it

2874
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:17,760
was really beautiful purple and i'm

2875
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:20,718
sucker for purples

2876
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,800
but um in the bx1 i had crossed it to

2877
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:26,319
and actually done a few but the one that

2878
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:29,440
i ran with was the platinum banana og

2879
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:32,479
as the male from it and out cross to

2880
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:34,879
that back to the green crack and

2881
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:36,638
all i found was a lot of platinum banana

2882
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,000
og plants and not many green cracks and

2883
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,920
i didn't expect that because usually

2884
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,920
green crack breeds dominant but that was

2885
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,520
one of those cases where it's like okay

2886
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,279
even though it's a bx1 and it sounds

2887
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,600
like it should be super green crappy

2888
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:49,759
that's not how it played out in

2889
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,079
in practice it was only in theory so it

2890
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,760
kind of was an epic fail and this is why

2891
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:55,118
breeding is such a [ __ ]

2892
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,520
because you spend all this time and

2893
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:59,679
energy doing it and then you're like oh

2894
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:02,480
i don't like that that choice

2895
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:04,719
backstage go back go back you know go

2896
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:05,599
you know slide slide back down and start

2897
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,480
over

2898
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,320
yeah

2899
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,759
uh and so there's a lot of missteps and

2900
01:40:08,319 --> 01:40:11,359
there's a lot of things that you hope

2901
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,600
will happen like i'm gonna take this and

2902
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:15,198
cross it to this and i'm hoping these

2903
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,039
traits come together and you and then

2904
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:19,039
you're like oh that's a horrible

2905
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:20,719
yeah i gotta back up

2906
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:23,279
uh and that's why so many people just

2907
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:24,639
like to make one one-off outcrosses to

2908
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:26,639
different things

2909
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:28,800
not test it and just release it and just

2910
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:30,400
move on to something else yeah

2911
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,159
because you can spend a bunch of time

2912
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:34,000
[ __ ] around

2913
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:35,679
and that spit so much time i mean there

2914
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,719
was there's an aspect where bodhi was

2915
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:41,760
telling me when when he first got the 88

2916
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:44,639
g13 hash plant right

2917
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,920
from uh ndn guy seeds

2918
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:47,920
yeah

2919
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,199
he didn't realize that they were already

2920
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,639
f4

2921
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:51,919
yeah so

2922
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,400
he kept

2923
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,920
the first he kept males and females of

2924
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:57,439
the first round

2925
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,319
and didn't lose him

2926
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:01,439
but then he took it three more gens

2927
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:03,679
yeah right

2928
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:04,638
and it got shittier and shittier every

2929
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,359
gem

2930
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:10,000
yeah and what he ended up using

2931
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:12,238
was the very first seeds that he popped

2932
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,399
from the initial seeds that he got

2933
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:16,079
yeah and that's what and that's what's

2934
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:16,960
in all those hybrids that people buy

2935
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:19,439
from him

2936
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:21,600
is because those those moms and dads

2937
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:24,079
made way better crosses

2938
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,600
yeah than any of the intentional work he

2939
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:28,000
did after because he thought he was

2940
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,400
getting it kind of raw so he's like oh

2941
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,560
open pollinated a couple times

2942
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:35,279
yeah you know and he spent all this time

2943
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,360
three doing going three gens that's a

2944
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,279
lot of time that is a lot of time a lot

2945
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:40,719
of effort and it's not rewarded yeah and

2946
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:42,960
then you're like and then he's like each

2947
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,960
one of these gems sucks ass and i'm not

2948
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,279
gonna use them yeah i'm just gonna stick

2949
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:50,158
with this first [ __ ] i have over here

2950
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,198
yeah i could have saved myself a year

2951
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:53,439
yeah

2952
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:55,519
you know and so that [ __ ] happens

2953
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:57,839
and i can guarantee you

2954
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,960
after being in this business this long

2955
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,400
that

2956
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,920
what's what's sad and what a lot of

2957
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:04,158
people have noticed that that are in

2958
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,000
this business is that they're the how

2959
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:08,879
quickly things sell

2960
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,439
it how much work you put into it has no

2961
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,520
reliance on that it's all in the name

2962
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:16,399
it's all in the hype it's all in that

2963
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:18,719
kind of stuff so there's no real reward

2964
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:20,399
to putting in all that extra work

2965
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:23,118
to then fail

2966
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:25,198
and spend a lot of money doing it or to

2967
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:26,799
then succeed and still

2968
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:28,719
not be able to outsell something else

2969
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,400
that's being hyped so

2970
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,000
when people when people make comments

2971
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:34,238
about like i don't see braiders doing

2972
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,118
long work anymore there's a reason it's

2973
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:39,359
just not financially viable uh anymore

2974
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:41,279
and as as bad as it sucks to hear that

2975
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,279
as bad as it sucks to say it that's

2976
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:44,319
where it's at and that's why most

2977
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:46,399
breeders

2978
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:49,198
if you were to ask them

2979
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:51,679
like you know to like

2980
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:53,279
people breed and they put in a bunch of

2981
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:54,960
crosses and then they make a bunch of

2982
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:57,198
packaging and stuff and i'm not dissing

2983
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,039
it by any means but i'm just saying that

2984
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:02,559
they don't have time

2985
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:05,439
to test every round of everything

2986
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:07,600
you just can't anymore before release

2987
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:09,599
you know it's not it's not it's not

2988
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,880
feasible you know you can you might look

2989
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,159
through the things that you're the most

2990
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,480
interested in

2991
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:16,079
always but yeah and see and be like oh i

2992
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:17,198
really want to see what's in this hybrid

2993
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:19,118
you know

2994
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:20,158
even that is the minimum i can think of

2995
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:22,079
like

2996
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:23,519
seven people that do even that much you

2997
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:24,960
know what i mean it's very it's very

2998
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,000
difficult and then there's an aspect

2999
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,920
where

3000
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,158
you know i mean matt and i when we were

3001
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,079
researching like uh i guess you'd call

3002
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:33,679
it last season's podcast that we were

3003
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:35,840
doing and we were doing a bunch of

3004
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:39,199
neville work you could go through the

3005
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:41,119
scentsy catalog from 91 to 95

3006
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:42,399
and it barely changed

3007
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:44,719
yeah

3008
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:46,638
barely at all just little tiny things

3009
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:48,960
barely changed you know some some names

3010
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:51,440
here and there one or two things but

3011
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:54,239
maybe in five years they added three or

3012
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:55,039
four things to the catalog yeah

3013
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:56,000
right

3014
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:57,198
and

3015
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,760
now

3016
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:02,399
it's like people come out with 20 or 25

3017
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,560
new strains every crop ev every time

3018
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:06,559
they make make a drop

3019
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,320
yeah a lot of the times and then when

3020
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,639
they make another drop six months later

3021
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:11,920
it's a totally different set of [ __ ]

3022
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,920
yeah

3023
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,760
so it's become vastly different people

3024
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,239
used to be able to get away with simon

3025
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:21,199
from serious seeds

3026
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:24,079
for 20 years he sold six things

3027
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:25,359
yeah right that don't work no more no

3028
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:27,600
white russian

3029
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:30,479
chronic ak

3030
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,159
collie missed a bubble gum

3031
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,519
and uh

3032
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:35,359
one more

3033
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:38,159
one more than i'm forgetting yeah anyway

3034
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:40,079
he sold he sold six lines

3035
01:44:38,158 --> 01:44:43,039
yeah and he made those six lines over

3036
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:45,039
and over hey now i said ak i think but

3037
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:47,920
we could look it up but there maybe i i

3038
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:50,079
named it was six though i named five off

3039
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,520
the top of my head it was six for sure

3040
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:54,399
but it was six but

3041
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:56,560
you know 15 years of just making i'm

3042
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:58,079
gonna make these same hybrids again

3043
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,119
yeah i'm gonna make them i'm gonna make

3044
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:00,880
them i'm gonna make them i'm gonna make

3045
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:03,118
them and it was like they didn't have to

3046
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,639
change that much since these catalog the

3047
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:06,238
first five or six years was pretty

3048
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:08,159
consistent and then the last three or

3049
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:10,638
four years in the 90s they added four

3050
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:13,439
five or six more things yeah

3051
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,400
but then it stayed consistent after that

3052
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:16,479
yeah

3053
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:18,799
and now it's like that's not

3054
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:21,118
what breeders or growers or anyone

3055
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,920
expects it's got to be all new [ __ ]

3056
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:24,238
yep

3057
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,760
yeah i mean even with me early on i

3058
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:27,198
would like to do clock the clockwork

3059
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,880
orange i'd always keep that in stock and

3060
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:29,759
like the white russian

3061
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,199
big

3062
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,039
i think you didn't say that maybe i

3063
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:36,079
still like russian i don't know yeah i

3064
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:37,359
don't know but it kept it in stock man

3065
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:38,960
over the years you realize that's not

3066
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:41,920
even viable to do anymore because people

3067
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:44,399
want new and now and new and now at all

3068
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,319
times and not everyone

3069
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:49,039
obviously but the the majority of the

3070
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:51,679
seed people buying seeds that's how it

3071
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:54,238
goes and if you don't do that you it's

3072
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:56,399
not a viable company anymore and so matt

3073
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,559
and i laugh because we read

3074
01:45:56,399 --> 01:46:00,638
all this stuff about what people think

3075
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,000
breeders act most a lot of breeders are

3076
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,800
actually doing

3077
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,118
yeah

3078
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,800
versus what they actually do

3079
01:46:05,118 --> 01:46:08,158
yeah and they're like oh these guys are

3080
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,600
testing this and that and they're

3081
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:11,198
looking for herms and they're looking

3082
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,719
for this and they're doing this and that

3083
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,719
and they're making choices and

3084
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:16,079
selections and they're

3085
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:18,319
not most of them

3086
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:20,158
yeah because the the most profitable way

3087
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:22,319
right now to make seeds is just to like

3088
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:25,039
blow off a room

3089
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,719
d you know collect the seeds

3090
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:28,079
i think it's even worse than that i

3091
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:29,679
think the most profitable way to make

3092
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:31,760
seeds like with compound and guys like

3093
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:34,079
that they buy seeds from other people

3094
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,840
already made and label them something

3095
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:37,840
they're hyping there's a bunch of stuff

3096
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,440
that goes on with like people would be

3097
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,520
shocked to know

3098
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:43,759
you know how many how many of their like

3099
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,679
some of their favorite cali people got

3100
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,360
their seeds made in spain

3101
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:49,520
yeah yeah

3102
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:51,599
you know or had some dude that they know

3103
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:53,600
that has a tent make seeds and act like

3104
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,199
they're blowing up their facilities yeah

3105
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:57,760
yeah and so there's a lot of there's a

3106
01:46:55,198 --> 01:46:59,599
lot of fakery there you know and people

3107
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,360
eat it up and they realize that they

3108
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,679
with ig and with these things they can

3109
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:06,079
control the narrative and hype

3110
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:06,960
and people never see behind the screen

3111
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,118
door

3112
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,239
yep and so the amount that they think

3113
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:12,158
that they're

3114
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:13,919
uh yeah people most aren't even germ

3115
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:16,559
testing most aren't even taking 100 or

3116
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:18,880
200 seeds and spending two or three days

3117
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,960
and making sure they get a good pop rate

3118
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,400
yeah no and that's what [ __ ] candy

3119
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,000
rain

3120
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:25,519
they didn't even pop you know and he

3121
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,880
sold them they sold them for like 800

3122
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,560
bucks a piece

3123
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,600
or 800 bucks a pack or something like

3124
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,000
that you know

3125
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,440
um and but so there's all these things

3126
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,359
that they think their breeders are like

3127
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:37,759
these mad scientists like really putting

3128
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:39,198
in the work

3129
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,960
and most and that's how they present

3130
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:43,279
themselves yeah and then the people that

3131
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,600
do put in work and but don't show it

3132
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:47,439
that much for various reasons they get

3133
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,280
called out for being the big guys that

3134
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:50,960
aren't doing the work yeah

3135
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:52,399
all the time and you're like dude your

3136
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,600
hero

3137
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:57,599
is like paying some kids to do the work

3138
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,760
while doing photo ops

3139
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,239
while while ordering half of it from

3140
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,199
dean of them in spain

3141
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:04,799
right

3142
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:07,439
yeah and you think he's been carefully

3143
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,400
working on it for the past 12 12 months

3144
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:10,079
yeah

3145
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:11,839
you know and he's just putting his name

3146
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:13,760
on it

3147
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,560
it's literally a re-label

3148
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:18,800
yeah that's how it goes it's how it goes

3149
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:21,600
you know and and there's not a lot of

3150
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,920
pressure so i'm not it's just and so

3151
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,480
what matt was basically saying is that

3152
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,880
there's not incentive

3153
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:30,959
or for financial survival for most

3154
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,880
people to do

3155
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,000
what the customer base would like them

3156
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,000
to do

3157
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,520
yeah

3158
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,039
in my opinion

3159
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,400
yeah no there isn't

3160
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:41,920
it's just not there it's not there

3161
01:48:40,399 --> 01:48:43,679
anymore unfortunately it used to be

3162
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:45,440
there and i think a lot of us would

3163
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,079
rather just quit than

3164
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:49,839
join the stupid [ __ ] parade

3165
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:52,319
yeah i mean think about it for a minute

3166
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:53,760
you know think about how many people out

3167
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:56,719
there

3168
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,520
can do what our buddy csi does

3169
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:01,600
yeah which is show pictures of rooms

3170
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,400
regularly of what was running and show

3171
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,400
pictures of seeds that he made

3172
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:07,839
that there's 200 phenols growing in a

3173
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:08,799
room

3174
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,560
yep

3175
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,400
you know and you can go years and years

3176
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,960
and years back of he hasn't he hasn't

3177
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,879
popped everything he's made that's crazy

3178
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,639
yeah but he's constantly popping stuff

3179
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,159
that he's made

3180
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:24,560
and looking through it and that kind of

3181
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:25,439
dedication is like uber rare

3182
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,719
you know

3183
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:30,399
um it's like him and a few other and

3184
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:32,800
you know a few other people

3185
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:34,399
and some hobbyists who are doing it for

3186
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,279
love

3187
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:38,238
uh and most of the famous people no

3188
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:39,118
yeah

3189
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:40,879
no

3190
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:42,479
definitely not because it's just not

3191
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,319
financially feasible and they don't have

3192
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:45,839
the space and they don't really have any

3193
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:47,840
goals either they're trying to just make

3194
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,480
much money off a seed drop

3195
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,440
yeah caleb caleb i can guarantee you

3196
01:49:50,479 --> 01:49:53,359
will

3197
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:56,158
spend every time doing it right because

3198
01:49:53,359 --> 01:49:58,000
he's so ocd and autistic about how he

3199
01:49:56,158 --> 01:50:00,960
gets it done and well he's very

3200
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,198
admirable he also his favorite part of

3201
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,760
the whole process is seeing what's in

3202
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:08,158
the hybrids he makes oh yeah yeah that's

3203
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:10,239
actually testing that's actually the

3204
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:12,879
part that keeps him going the rest of it

3205
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:15,439
is kind of a soul-drenching grind

3206
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,319
yeah but that he gets excited about

3207
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:18,158
yeah

3208
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:20,238
so that's cool i've never met a man more

3209
01:50:18,158 --> 01:50:21,359
excited about genetics and seeds than

3210
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:23,118
that man

3211
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:25,359
and it's it's [ __ ] awesome because

3212
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:26,960

anywhere

3228
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:57,360

3284
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:47,439
finland character when he has the full

3293
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:06,000

3294
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,039
some stuff that like blew my head off

3295
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,439
about super dog

3296
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:13,198
in in some forum posts and stuff like

3297
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:14,479
that that we won't get into

3298
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:15,919
yeah but

3299
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:16,879
needless to say

3300
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:18,800
um

3301
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,560
i i think what happened is is that

3302
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:22,880
there's a

3303
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:25,280
there's a few versions and there's a few

3304
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:27,039
things that happened over time

3305
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:29,359
right and

3306
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:32,399
my buddy who i never mentioned uh i just

3307
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:34,399
call him staten island uh it's mostly

3308
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:37,359
it's it's a it's a bunch of it's it's a

3309
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:39,039
bunch of his story really but yeah

3310
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:42,000
um

3311
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:45,198
you know uh the story starts i guess

3312
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
with he gave the super skunk to

3313
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:51,919
uh chem dog to greg yeah right

3314
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:54,319
and in 93-ish i think and um

3315
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:56,319
94-ish greg calls him up and he's super

3316
01:53:54,319 --> 01:53:58,799
excited because

3317
01:53:56,319 --> 01:54:00,399
the super skunk had permed onto the chem

3318
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,480
dock

3319
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:05,039
right and he got a bunch of seed and he

3320
01:54:02,479 --> 01:54:07,439
grew this seed up and he said

3321
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:09,359
this seed is so amazing

3322
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:11,519
i'm growing this stuff instead of the

3323
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:15,039
cam dock

3324
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:17,360
it's unbelievable right yeah and so

3325
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:19,599
there was this aspect where gat where my

3326
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:20,880
buddy staten island thought

3327
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:22,639
okay

3328
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,840
maybe we could blend these two things

3329
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,560
together

3330
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:29,039
yeah but we didn't know [ __ ] he didn't

3331
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:31,039
know [ __ ] about sts or reversals or

3332
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:33,279
anything like that back there right

3333
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:35,519
yeah this is so pre-pre that it's

3334
01:54:33,279 --> 01:54:36,639
unbelievable so yeah

3335
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:39,360
homie

3336
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,880
3 000 miles away just had an accident

3337
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,279
and got some seat

3338
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:44,639
yeah and so homie out here thought oh

3339
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:47,198
maybe i'll have an accident maybe it'll

3340
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:51,118
do this but he basically started the

3341
01:54:47,198 --> 01:54:53,839
project and he took a a a hawaiian plant

3342
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:55,920
and crossed it to the super skunk cut

3343
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:59,039
yeah and then he got he got like a super

3344
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:02,158
skunk line for lack of a better term

3345
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:03,519
right bred that a couple of times

3346
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:06,000
and then

3347
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,920
he took uh he took some males of that

3348
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,800
and tossed it on the

3349
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:14,000
we tossed it on the the chem 91

3350
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,880
yeah and the super dog was born

3351
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,118
right

3352
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:19,279
um and i was helping him a little bit in

3353
01:55:17,118 --> 01:55:21,198
the middle of that and then him and i

3354
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:23,439
worked together on hunting through a

3355
01:55:21,198 --> 01:55:26,960
bunch of super dog itself

3356
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:27,759
right and doing further outcrosses

3357
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,880
so

3358
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:33,039
there was some stuff on the east coast

3359
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:36,000
that might have had a similar name that

3360
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:37,599
came about in a very different fashion

3361
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,359
you know but no

3362
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:40,719
get the [ __ ] out of here yes you know

3363
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:43,279
what i'm going to tell i'm going to tell

3364
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:44,079
one real quick story and

3365
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:46,158
so

3366
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:47,679
i i was obsessed with finding that super

3367
01:55:46,158 --> 01:55:49,920
dog cut because i was a big fan of

3368
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:51,679
diesel and supposedly they were similar

3369
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,880
genetics one was cam 91 super skunk

3370
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:57,118
supposedly one was supposedly chem d

3371
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:59,118
super skunk according to the canon bible

3372
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:01,118
at the time so i i had already had

3373
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:02,960
diesel and i loved it and the superdog

3374
01:56:01,118 --> 01:56:04,319
really interest me and and i wasn't sure

3375
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:07,520
if maybe they got it wrong and it's the

3376
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:09,039
same cut so i remember asking greg back

3377
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:11,599
then chem dog

3378
01:56:09,039 --> 01:56:13,359
about it and he kind of inferred that he

3379
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,520
had read it and then i saw another post

3380
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:16,799
today where he again inferred he read it

3381
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,960
so

3382
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,239
the fact that it was the same genetics

3383
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,039
as your guys's

3384
01:56:20,238 --> 01:56:24,638
out in the west coast

3385
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:26,639
and there's still no pictures no

3386
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:28,400
provenance nothing for it and every time

3387
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,800
i ask for any info about it all i get

3388
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:33,679
even and with diesel as well all still

3389
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:36,079
all i get is let me check my notes

3390
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:37,840
and and i like to do a lot i like kim

3391
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:40,479
dog a lot he's a good dude i've met his

3392
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:41,920
wife she's really cool um but yeah

3393
01:56:40,479 --> 01:56:44,559
that's that's as far as i can get with

3394
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:46,399
it i do think in my opinion

3395
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:48,159
i think

3396
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:49,598
they didn't know much about super dog

3397
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:52,158
they heard about it and that he may have

3398
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:54,239
taken credit for it back then and it was

3399
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:56,399
probably what was going on with gabby

3400
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:57,279
and you yeah okay so

3401
01:56:56,399 --> 01:56:58,879
so

3402
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:00,319
we did a bunch of work on it and it took

3403
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,840
us a night we and you know it's like

3404
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:03,840
there's a lot of projects like that

3405
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,639
where when you don't have some specific

3406
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,719
goal

3407
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:08,560
in terms of like timing or anything it's

3408
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:10,239
like we popped off a rip here and then

3409
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,719
four months later six months later we

3410
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:14,319
did another stage of it over here and

3411
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:15,760
then you know it's kind of like that

3412
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:18,719
you're doing it along while you're

3413
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:20,480
growing and yeah um we ended up what

3414
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:22,000
happened is what most people what most

3415
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:24,000
people know of is we started picking

3416
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,960
phenos like the seven the three the

3417
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,599
thirty

3418
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:30,158
um there's some pictures of it in the

3419
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:33,199
can of bible yeah i started spreading it

3420
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:36,238
around i started giving out uh selected

3421
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:38,000
cuttings to friends and we crossed it

3422
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:39,519
uh there was a time when we did you know

3423
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,880
we were trying to do

3424
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:42,880
um

3425
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,599
i don't know what you'd call it it's not

3426
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:48,000
quite open pollination okay but we

3427
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:50,079
basically took out of out of hundreds of

3428
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,198
seeds we took like our four or five

3429
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:56,319
favorite males yeah combined with about

3430
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:57,759
seven or eight of our favorite females

3431
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:58,880
yeah and we put them in a room and we

3432
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:02,239
bloomed them

3433
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:03,440
and then we threw in literally

3434
01:58:02,238 --> 01:58:05,519
every good

3435
01:58:03,439 --> 01:58:06,638
cutting that we had at the time

3436
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:10,080
so

3437
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:14,079
actual chem 91 actual super skunk the

3438
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:18,000
warlock my black domina cut the maui

3439
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:19,039
uh the the mendo perps

3440
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,920
yeah

3441
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:24,399
the crippy no no we didn't have this was

3442
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:26,000
before i didn't have a kush um yeah i

3443
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:28,399
didn't have a kush quite yet or anything

3444
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,079
like that but uh but we so we did

3445
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:31,759
basically just like it was like bread

3446
01:58:30,079 --> 01:58:33,920
amongst itself

3447
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:36,719
yeah and then we bred it to like every

3448
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:38,560
fire cut we had at the time

3449
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:42,639
and yeah

3450
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:44,000
okay go ahead go ahead oh my gosh um

3451
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:45,760
so

3452
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,599
you know i uh

3453
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:51,360
uh

3454
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:53,840
that one totally distracted me but i um

3455
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:55,198
i did that herbalist i did do that one

3456
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:57,039
that's the uh what i call the skunk

3457
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,039
spray cam line and that's the only other

3458
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:00,719
one besides um

3459
01:58:59,039 --> 01:59:03,118
the heirloom afghani line that i

3460
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:05,599
consistently can can make skunky [ __ ]

3461
01:59:03,118 --> 01:59:07,439
come out of really easily so

3462
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:08,960
i mean you know uh he doesn't really

3463
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:10,559
like to chat in public or whatever but

3464
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:11,359
he probably uh

3465
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,039
um

3466
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:14,880
my buddy from staten island is probably

3467
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:16,560
should get the most credit for the

3468
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:19,039
superdog because he put the most time

3469
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:21,840
into it uh him and i did do projects

3470
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:23,198
with it together and then it was the

3471
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,279
projects that him and i were doing

3472
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:26,960
together that ended up getting spread

3473
01:59:25,279 --> 01:59:28,719
out and getting photographed and getting

3474
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:31,599
traded to people and that's kind of i

3475
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:32,639
think where it started popping up on the

3476
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:34,719
forums

3477
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:37,520
yeah and people started talking about it

3478
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:38,639
and seeing it i gave a bunch of superdog

3479
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:41,599
hybrids

3480
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:43,679
to mandelbrot uh and that's kind of the

3481
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:46,000
basis of the males that he started with

3482
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:47,520
his uh emerald emerald mountain seed

3483
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,158
company and all that

3484
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,599
um so that so it started it got it got

3485
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:53,198
mixed into some other things that are

3486
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:55,520
pretty famous too

3487
01:59:53,198 --> 01:59:57,759
um but we won't go into that right here

3488
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,760
but it what we were trying to do

3489
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:01,360
is we were trying to get the density and

3490
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,440
the potency

3491
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:05,198
of the chem 91

3492
02:00:03,439 --> 02:00:07,759
yeah combined with

3493
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:10,000
the the color and the crystal content

3494
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:12,880
and the nose of the skunk

3495
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,158
yeah so we wanted potency and density

3496
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:16,480
from over here

3497
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:19,279
and we wanted a little bit better looks

3498
02:00:16,479 --> 02:00:20,158
and frost and terp from over here

3499
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:21,759
yeah

3500
02:00:20,158 --> 02:00:24,000
and it worked pretty well

3501
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:25,599
it was killer you know and honestly it

3502
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,000
probably would have it probably would

3503
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:28,800
have taken off a bunch more if

3504
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,719
the

3505
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,199
purple and then kush

3506
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:34,960
and diesel craze hadn't started

3507
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:37,039
where everyone wanted to grow the exact

3508
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:38,880
same strains to get the dollar

3509
02:00:37,039 --> 02:00:41,118
yeah for sure

3510
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:43,199
you know um

3511
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:46,799
yes the super dog would have been in in

3512
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:49,039
dispose in 2001 in the bay 100

3513
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,840
uh that would definitely be an era that

3514
02:00:49,039 --> 02:00:51,198
uh

3515
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:53,360
there would definitely be an era where

3516
02:00:51,198 --> 02:00:55,439
you could have gotten uh a lot of super

3517
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:56,880
dog went to the bay

3518
02:00:55,439 --> 02:00:57,839
a whole bunch

3519
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:00,079
you know

3520
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,920
um and you know

3521
02:01:00,079 --> 02:01:03,920
uh

3522
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,520
uh you know i've talked before about how

3523
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,279
we lost it and some of the different

3524
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,719
things and been hunting for it for a

3525
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:10,639
long time

3526
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:12,000
um it uh

3527
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:13,199
you know it exists in a bunch of

3528
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,520
children

3529
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:19,039
um and you know

3530
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,239
skunk and chem seem to be a great combo

3531
02:01:19,039 --> 02:01:23,118
yeah

3532
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:26,559
in general i know i know that at least

3533
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:28,960
in 2000 let's say 11 or 12

3534
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,719
that maui superdog was still being grown

3535
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,800
up north that weird i don't know if you

3536
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:35,279
know karnak the weirdo oh dude so

3537
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,279
there's there's phenos i have friends

3538
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:39,519
from trinity county that grew for years

3539
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:43,439
and their boss his favorite strain was a

3540
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:45,599
maui super dog yeah uh a maui super dog

3541
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:47,678
hybrid um

3542
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:50,400
you know some of the maui super dog uh

3543
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:51,920
mandelbrot wrote about it a bunch but he

3544
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:54,399
found out of seeds that i gave him

3545
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,719
something he ended up calling the truth

3546
02:01:54,399 --> 02:01:58,479
yeah yeah which was maui by super dog

3547
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:00,079
that's just a straight maui by super dog

3548
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:01,359
so i think bitter is still holding that

3549
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:02,960
cut for you too by the way and so

3550
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:04,799
there's there's a number there's a

3551
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,760
number of phenos of that that float

3552
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,199
around

3553
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:08,639
yeah and there's some other stuff we

3554
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:11,118
won't get into right now because that's

3555
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:13,520
a whole nother movie where it's in

3556
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:14,719
um so it's it's it's blended into

3557
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:17,119
different things

3558
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:19,439
um but it's one of those gigs where it's

3559
02:02:17,118 --> 02:02:20,639
like weed reinvents itself every five or

3560
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:22,479
ten years

3561
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:24,719
and people only like to grow what's easy

3562
02:02:22,479 --> 02:02:26,959
and popular and it would probably knock

3563
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:29,520
people's socks off today but it came out

3564
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,840
at a time when it wasn't able to get as

3565
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:33,199
famous

3566
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:36,800
you know because it was coming out in

3567
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:38,559
2000 2001 2002 2003 you know it's just

3568
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:41,119
that was just like a different era

3569
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:43,039
yeah things didn't get like naturally

3570
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:44,238
hyped very easily well it just couldn't

3571
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:46,079
spread

3572
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:48,158
yeah people that couldn't communicate as

3573
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:50,238
much uh clones didn't spread as much

3574
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:52,559
there wasn't clone trading going on very

3575
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:54,638
much there wasn't clone mailing

3576
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,760
anything like that you know so

3577
02:02:54,639 --> 02:03:00,239
um so there's an aspect to that that

3578
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,679
someone's asking if you uh what did you

3579
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:02,799
all find out did you find a line on

3580
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,279
anything that you thought was lost

3581
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:07,199
recently not so

3582
02:03:05,279 --> 02:03:10,800
that i thought was lost

3583
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:12,879
yeah i mean i uh there's you know

3584
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,520
we did get something that i considered

3585
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:17,679
to be the trinity or at least

3586
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,440
you know extremely extremely close to

3587
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:22,239
the the right cut

3588
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:24,399
you know um so and we that was lost for

3589
02:03:22,238 --> 02:03:26,559
15 or 18 years to us

3590
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:27,598
and i'm still not sure if it's the exact

3591
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,000
right thing

3592
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:31,920
um but if it's even the people that seem

3593
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,800
to think it might be not

3594
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:37,279
think it's incredibly closely related

3595
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:39,679
yeah like it on s1 or you know something

3596
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:43,279
like that but i think it's the real one

3597
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:45,279
um and now what gets hard is that uh

3598
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:46,880
because old things are becoming popular

3599
02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:48,960
again everyone's coming out of the

3600
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,480
woodwork with old things

3601
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,719
yeah

3602
02:03:50,479 --> 02:03:54,238
that goes back to the [ __ ]

3603
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:56,399
question that dude had about a smear

3604
02:03:54,238 --> 02:03:59,439
campaign i absolutely

3605
02:03:56,399 --> 02:04:00,238
consider diesel chem skunk weed

3606
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:01,919
yes

3607
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:02,638
yes 100

3608
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,440
yeah

3609
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:08,400
super to me diesel and sour diesel and

3610
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:09,439
all that is is kemp is is chem skunk

3611
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:10,719
blend

3612
02:04:09,439 --> 02:04:13,519
okay and

3613
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:14,639
before we close it down i want uh

3614
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,320
someone wanted you to talk about

3615
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:17,920
francine they kept they kept mentioning

3616
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:20,399
it

3617
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:21,760
so francine was an extremely tasty

3618
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:22,638
indica

3619
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:24,560
um

3620
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:26,960
and obviously that's that's the cut that

3621
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:28,000
facilitated the the trade for the super

3622
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,000
skunk

3623
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,920
um and uh

3624
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,359
my buddy ended up we ended up letting it

3625
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:34,960
go

3626
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:38,238
because like a lot of

3627
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,279
amazing afghans uh it had horrific raw

3628
02:04:38,238 --> 02:04:40,718
issues

3629
02:04:39,279 --> 02:04:42,639
yeah

3630
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:44,639
and it could it could grow all these big

3631
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:46,400
beautiful colas

3632
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:47,760
and then there'd be gray rot running up

3633
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:50,158
the center stem

3634
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:53,440
yeah and a lot of people had fine had

3635
02:04:50,158 --> 02:04:57,598
had issues with breeding a lot of early

3636
02:04:53,439 --> 02:05:00,158
afghans because afghans bred in rot

3637
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:02,078
yeah because they grew up in a in a dry

3638
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:03,920
cold afghan environment and then they

3639
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:07,118
get brought to like moderate sort of

3640
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:09,599
humid california at times and they just

3641
02:05:07,118 --> 02:05:11,439
they just couldn't handle it yeah so it

3642
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:12,639
was it's one of those things where it's

3643
02:05:11,439 --> 02:05:15,919
part of the lore but it was

3644
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:18,078
intentionally dropped for issues

3645
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,359
and it was dropped long before any of us

3646
02:05:18,078 --> 02:05:20,960
thought that any of this weed that we

3647
02:05:19,359 --> 02:05:22,559
were growing would matter

3648
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:24,800
yeah i'm sure

3649
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,920
too you know

3650
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:29,199
so

3651
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:31,039
um so yeah i mean we've now been talking

3652
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:32,319
two hours and six minutes

3653
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:34,078

3654
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:36,719
