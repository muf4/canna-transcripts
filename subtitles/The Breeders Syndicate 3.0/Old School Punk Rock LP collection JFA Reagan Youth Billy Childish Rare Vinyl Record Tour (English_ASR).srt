mean I had eBay searches going for years

336
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:44,819
and stuff to find this pop rivets LP was

337
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,379
insane I don't know if it's still that

338
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,480
hard but I mean back then things were

339
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,519
really hard to find I mean we had eBay

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,399
but it was just it was just barely

341

00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:01,439
the action

346
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,440

yeah protects this is a later press

348
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,180
