00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,099
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,900

00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,419
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,219
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,219
to the underground

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,819
can you kind of Enlighten us a little

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,739
bit on on Mark Emery both of you just

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,359
give us a quick take from a Canadian

21
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,038
perspective on Mark Emery because we

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,839
don't have a really clear one at least

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,179
from my era and point of view in the

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,180
United States well like one thing I'm

25
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,399
not sure about was Mark Emery involved

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,519
in cannabis cannabis before like the

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,859
hemp Nation constitutional challenge no

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,020
no no no wait well the Constitutional

29
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,579
challenge he started NPC by that time

30
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,759
but you have to remember Mark's from

31
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,500
this town from my town yeah yeah

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,460
um he had a bookstore here called City

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,280
Lights

34
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:20,519
you scam those people also when it came

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,320
to selling it but um Mark

36
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,399
um I call him the dark enemy for a

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,158
reason

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,500
um I think it's very suiting it on it

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,080
ironically matches his name but he is

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,060
somebody that you know in his own word

41
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,200
said he was against legalization of

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,299
cannabis

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,840
due to the amount of money that he was

44
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,439
making from selling seeds illegally yeah

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,400
um he proved this when

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,199
um after hemp nation was busted for the

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,759
second time well first time was Great

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,640
Canadian Emporium second time it was

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,159
Temptation yeah um

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,799
the

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,340
uh Chris was not allowed to sell

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,219
paraphernalia after that so

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,479
we desire he decided that

54
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:11,340
um he reached out to to Mark who had NBC

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,080
and said Hey listen do you want to buy

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,360
all the inventory from hemp Nation

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,340
because we need to raise the money for

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,319
the Constitutional challenge

59
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,500
and he agreed he's like yeah send me

60
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:25,019
everything and then it was like pulling

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,479
teeth to get paid from him and by the

62
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,459
very end of it I mean it wasn't a

63
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,699
shitload of money you know maybe it was

64
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,159
only 10 20 grand or something like that

65
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,619
in inventory but when you're fighting

66
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,560
the government to legalize cannabis

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,019
every penny counts sure and Chris kept

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,300
getting the you know oh talk to my

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,739
account and talk to my accountant at

70
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,260
this time it was in around this time uh

71
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,019
uh friends of mine through through Red

72
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,299
from Legends a mutual friend worked for

73
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,819
for Mark

74
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,300
uh basically almost as like manager area

75
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:05,939
of sales for his direct seeds yeah and

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,719
he was doing something like

77
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,579
20 40 60 000 a week in cannabis sales

78
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,560
and Seed sales

79
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,980
wow and when it was all said and done

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,800
with hemp Nation Chris claimed uh uh

81
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,598
bankruptcy with Mark Emery still owing

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,159
him money and it was only maybe a

83
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,139
thousand or two thousand dollars at the

84
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:28,259
end of it but it kind of just showed

85
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:31,799
what the term douchebag and yeah wrote

86
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:34,378
my use of the word douchebag

87
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,739
I I have to start saving it for like the

88
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:39,539
appropriate people and dark enemy is I

89
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,120
feel the biggest douchebag in our

90
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,579
industry he you know claims that he

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,120
donated all this money and stuff like

92
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,760
that but he didn't he uh he would you

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,099
know he did a a interview I think it was

94
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,699
on like CBC or something

95
00:03:53,098 --> 00:04:00,119
and Jody him and Jody and him were

96
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:03,060
together for less than a year maybe and

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,539
he's sitting there having her like click

98
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,580
his toenails on camera while he's being

99
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,139
interviewed and I think he's my mistake

100
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,939
he got up and he was butt naked or

101
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,399
something like that and I was just like

102
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:17,879
what kind of [ __ ] douchebag again the

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,858
word douchebag yeah uh lets or allows

104
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,519
his girlfriend

105

probably if I asked her to yeah we're in

110
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,900
a [ __ ] lifetime ask for her to do it

00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,300
on camera the show crazy there was a big

112
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,258
thing that came out like he he was just

113
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,259
very inappropriate

114
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,699
I can't say I don't know of any charges

115

130
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,978

things he used to do something here he

141
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,120

uh for stores to be open on Sunday when

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,819
before when it was illegal yeah kudos

144

quarter or Nickel in it kudos for that

151
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,478
but you know Mark Mark is like the

152
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,240
Donald Trump of the [ __ ] cannabis

burned so many [ __ ] bridges yeah the

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,720
thing is I got no yelling matches on

out of my store when he came into town

159
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,079
he can go to High Times the guy my

160
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,620

as much as he wants but uh I know him

162
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,319

163
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,160
traveler I took over all of hemp

164

the display cases including the

166
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:51,418
computers so on these computers I had

167
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:56,000
access to all the files and all the

168
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:58,799
outstanding debts that Marco so I was

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,019
bad-mouthing him and trying to be loud

170
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
enough that he would hear me yeah and

171
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,918
obviously he did because he called me up

172
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,939
one day on speakerphone with other

173
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,918
people in the background and uh and try

174
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,500
to [ __ ] me like try to make a scene

175
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:16,019
yeah Mark I got the [ __ ] computers

176
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,478

177
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,180
payments and what date and how much you

178
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,219
owed at the very end you tell me he's

179
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,780
like Peter was only [ __ ] thousand

180
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,060
bucks a couple thousand bucks I don't

181
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,500
give a [ __ ] you still love it in colors

182
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,019
man we were trying to [ __ ] change the

183
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,879
laws Chris went to [ __ ] jail for this

184
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:35,219
um Sarah went to jail for this this

185
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,098
guy's out there making tens if not

186
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,220
hundreds of thousands of dollars a month

187
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:43,079
yeah and he's gonna stiff some [ __ ]

188
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,680
guy that's trying to fight the marijuana

189
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,120
laws so that he can do that and now this

190
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,459
comes through word of mouth but the

191
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,038
people that tell me this kind of thing

192
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,318
um I give 10 times a thousand times more

193
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,978
credit than I give Mark yeah and they

194
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,139
said you know he'll admit that off

195
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:03,360
record obviously that why would he want

196
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,120
to legalize cannabis when he makes so

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
much money off the fact that it is

198
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,240
illegal

199
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,038
and especially in the states he wasn't

200
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,819
charged in Canada he was charged in the

201
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:17,279
states yeah right like [ __ ] buddy like

202
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,199
to move to the states I mean I'm I'm all

203
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,239
for spreading the seed everywhere we

204
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,419
don't want him use that [ __ ] you know

205
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,918
and what got me also was back then I was

206
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,019
actually

207
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,359
breeding I'll do air quotes because it's

208
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,399
not I was just breeding for seed to get

209
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,060
the seed out there and again we're going

210
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,259
back to the mid 90s kind of thing

211
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,778
um

212
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,939
we would send Mark seeds and this when

213
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,519
he was first started his uh seed

214
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,800
business and uh we would tell him or

215
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,659
whatever it was a buck a seat or

216
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,359
a couple bucks a seat or something like

217
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,759
that and we'd be honest like listen like

218
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,759
I told in the last interview I would buy

219
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,639
seeds from uh Scentsy or Greenhouse or

220
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,319
something and then do a breeding just

221
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,019
using those genetics and saying Hey

222
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,620
listen this is

223
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,539
um this is our Northern Lights we bought

224
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,700
the Northern Lights five we bought the

225
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,919
seed we made our own seed we're selling

226
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,959
it right yeah or we would say or we

227
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,579
liked uh we wanted to blend it so we did

228
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,919
like a Northern Lights chemo which was

229
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,240
something that we really liked and we

230
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,679
would sell Market seeds and he would

231
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,080
change the names or he would remove

232
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,359
certain things like he would just call

233
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,820
the Northern Lights chemo just chemo

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,220
right yeah

235
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,839
itself better right yeah so he was

236
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,019
didn't want us when he when it came to

237
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,399
what he was selling and um you know it

238
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,220
didn't happen he wasn't he wasn't

239
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,019
selling it as you know Scentsy seeds

240
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,420
[ __ ] Northern Lights he was just

241
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,759
saying hey this is pure Northern Lights

242
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:51,120
but it wasn't pure it was [ __ ] bread

243
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,580
by me or or hemp Nation crew and or in a

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,379
hemp Nation Garden or my garden and we

245
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,240
were just doing it to spread the Johnny

246
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,338
Appleseed we wanted to sell this yeah

247
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,980
you know we were selling I think it was

248
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,320
uh 10 seats or 25 bucks if something 250

249
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,080
a seat to get it out yeah the thing

250
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,339
right so you know people that again I've

251
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,240
even said in the last interview people

252
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,740
that focus on the money in this industry

253
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,299
uh are in the industry not the movement

254
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,639
and people that claim to be in the

255
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,799
movement like Mark does you know and he

256
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,319
he was hiding behind Jody

257
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,539
till the very end right like I don't

258
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,100
know what the [ __ ] is wrong with that

259
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,838
and I'm not going to get in any personal

260
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,639
[ __ ] because there's some

261
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,820
[ __ ] he's done to friends of mine

262
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,100
personally yeah I mean if you if you

263
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,839
Google Mark Emery and you look for stuff

264
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,839
it's like there's stuff out there it's

265
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,720
like when he got out west I I think it

266
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,360
got worse you know yeah it's all about

267
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,820
ego he always me and my friends

268
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,740
when we were out in Vancouver we

269
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,500
wouldn't step foot in the shop no like

270
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,299
on that strip like like we wouldn't like

271
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,220
we didn't even want to go into his

272
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,559
establishment like that's how much we

273
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,220
disliked him we just knew like he was a

274
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,078
piece of [ __ ] like [ __ ] him yeah

275
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,700
again he's it's about self-promotion

276
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,338
with him it's nothing to do with the

277
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,320
movement he's not one of them he was

278
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,019
anything but [ __ ] you know he went to

279
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
I think it was Thailand before he went

280
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,320
out west

281
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,939
you know uh or maybe it was during

282
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,459
because he went out there and like

283
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,839
dropped a bunch of money on some locals

284
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,299
said hey I just bought this property

285
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,640
here's [ __ ] x amount of dollars I

286
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:28,740
want a [ __ ] house and I come back you

287
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,078
know when he came back he went back

288
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,820
there the land was just overgrown

289
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,958
nothing built and his money was gone

290
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:39,420
awesome so yes I I would honestly wish

291
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,000
that there wasn't so many you know he

292
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,679
comes back to this town and he thinks

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,980
he's [ __ ] he ran for political office

294
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,899
last year yes oh yeah and uh it was

295
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,300
hilarious because every time I drove by

296
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,700
him I would call him a [ __ ] douchebag

297
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,139
yeah don't listen you're not liked

298
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,240
around here get the [ __ ] out here he got

299
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,039
very little votes and the funny thing is

300
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,139
is I was either driving my Volkswagen

301
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,419
bus and my Volkswagen Karma gear on my

302
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,399
truck or my Mini Cooper or my Jeep I was

303
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,139
always driving something different so

304
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,299
he's probably thought the whole [ __ ] I'm

305
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,879
I know I hope other people join me but

306
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,439
yeah was [ __ ] yelling at him left

307
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,299
right and Center because

308
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,620
he doesn't [ __ ] live here while he

309
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,539
might live here now I don't even know I

310
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,700
think he moved back here for a while I

311
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,159
can't believe he would go back honestly

312
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,680
like I like when I lived there I didn't

313
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,159
know one person that had anything to say

314
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,958
but negative but he he didn't choose to

315
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:34,679
leave London right he had to leave he

316
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,599
ended up he ended up [ __ ] he saw he

317
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,399
ended up [ __ ] a fireman's wife and I

318
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,139
don't for for some reason I thought he

319
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,278
was fairly high up in the fire

320
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,639
department I don't know if he was a

321
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:48,600
chief or or something like that but uh

322
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,339
rumor has it yeah they walked into his

323
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,740
[ __ ] bookstore

324
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,360
and so there's a lot of paper in here if

325
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,980
this is probably places probably go up

326
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,200
pretty quickly and sometimes we hit red

327
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,379
lights or something along that line was

328
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,180
said yeah kind of thing right I and

329
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,820
again could have been folklore it could

330
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,919
have been anything but because you know

331
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,160
I knew the type of person I know the

332
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,458
type of person he is right for sure see

333
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:17,578
that so you know it sucks to see people

334
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,679
like that get all the attention and it

335
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:21,899
gives us a bad name yeah people out

336
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,299
there especially as a Canadian like to

337
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,879
hear Prince of pot what the [ __ ] like

338
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:29,399
come on like that was yeah especially

339
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:33,899
like in BC he kept going in BC it's like

340
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:36,659
yeah well let's let's get to this so the

341
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,059
one thing that was resounding the

342
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,120
resounding criticism from the last

343
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:46,338
episode was that there were one or two

344
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,740
really loud BC Growers that they were

345
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:51,779
misrepresented very extreme can you can

346
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,120
you explain to Sean better than me I I

347
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,740
before like when before we did the first

348
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,620
one before we even recorded the first

349
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,360
one in our little homie chat I said

350
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,019
there's going to be some BC people

351
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,700
pissed off yeah and I have I have a

352
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,100
specific question in mind but I didn't

353
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,720
even ask that question and they still

354
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,940
got upset but

355
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,519
I actually went back and listened and I

356
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,639
know what he what the one guy at least

357
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,759
was upset about and and it was that Pete

358
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,860
said it all started here I was like yup

359
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,419
and then there was a comment about of

360
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,759
course there's there's good growers in

361
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,979
BC they're all from Ontario yeah but he

362
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,139
was like this by that you know yeah

363
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,778
whatever well but

364
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,220
I have a very specific uh Viewpoint

365
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,639
right yeah

366
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,160
but hey Dr not so I'm Back Where I Come

367
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,860
From right like I grew up in London so I

368
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,120
grew up around like I like there is like

369
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,100
commercial what my friends called

370
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
bikerweed right which was just the

371
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,500
commercial right yeah

372
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,660
but once once you found like that like

373
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,000
fan that downtown family which was not

374
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:59,519
hard to find you know

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,500
um you look you got great pot right yeah

376
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,899
yeah whether you were getting it from

377
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,698
well whatever I'm not gonna name but

378
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,100
like

379
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:10,559
so me and my friends like you know we

380
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,060
went on tour right we were like [ __ ]

381
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,979
this we're going on dead tour and we

382
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,859
just wanted to like we wanted to see the

383
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,959
shows because we we were heads but we

384
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,180
also wanted to see [ __ ] pot you know

385
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,399
that was like the two were just as equal

386
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:26,099
so we went down we did tour for a while

387
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,940
that led us to the west coast of the us

388
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,040
and we we saw that area and like

389
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,160
we were kind of like blown away like

390
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,019
number one the cost we could not [ __ ]

391
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,719
believe people were paying what they

392
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,578
were paying like that was just

393
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,100
mind-blowing right because it was

394
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:45,719
comparable to back home to us yeah and

395
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,060
then when we got to the West Coast it's

396
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,800
like same thing but like the only like

397
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,319
the only thing about the west coast is

398
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,879
we saw new stuff that like names we'd

399
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
never heard of and obviously there was

400
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,659
people breeding there right because it

401
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,639
was all this weird new [ __ ] it was the

402
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,500
first time I saw like white weed right

403
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,899
like it looked like mold in somebody's

404
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,899
hand but they're like no that's you know

405
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,659
that's [ __ ] you know resin

406
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,339
and then you know I lived in Arcata for

407
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,319
a while right so I lived in Arcata for a

408
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,560
good stretch and like I was there for a

409
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,240
while so I kind of saw and experienced

410
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,099
what was going on in that area and it

411
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
was really good weed like back home

412
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,899
though you know like for me it was like

413
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
what we had back home and then I got

414
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,759
back home and like I went into Pete shop

415
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,620
to like chat him up because back home

416
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,939
there's not too many people that you

417
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,799
could talk about that stuff and they

418
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,279
understand what you're talking about

419
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,740
and at the same time it was taking me

420
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,539
out to Vancouver with him right and

421
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,299
Pete's response was like you were just

422
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,639
like disappointed super disappointed

423
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,740
and you're like everybody goes out west

424
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,740
and they think the weed is so much

425
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,959
better there and it's not it's not you

426
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,539
know and I think and like I said I stand

427
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:01,078
by the what I said before about

428
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:03,480
um uh all the good Growers

429
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,220
well I would say all but I can't say all

430
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,539
right because we don't know yeah I'm

431
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,039
gonna say a large percentage and I'll

432
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:12,240
give you a few examples because a large

433
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:15,418
percentage I I got hired uh after a

434
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,179
state in Switzerland by a one of the

435
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,959
larger brokers

436
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:22,500
in

437
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,298
um the Vancouver area and uh like red he

438
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,939
was named after a different color let's

439
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,439
just say blue and um

440
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,779
and

441
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,900
I think he's from Ontario too honestly

442
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,000
but uh so they they've brought me into

443
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,519
this middle of butt [ __ ] nowhere between

444
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,919
Jasper and Kamloops along uh I think

445
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:41,759
it's Highway five and

446
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,220
um

447
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,619
built a huge Greenhouse in the middle of

448
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,220
the Bush off-grid I lived in a little

449
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:54,119
Log Cabin off grid or they already had

450
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,900
a 300 uh 300 bales of pro-mix hiked into

451
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:59,579
a bush and big huge uh outdoor beds and

452
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,559
I thought [ __ ] right man I'm in the

453
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,119
middle of [ __ ] nowhere I'm finally

454
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,819
gonna meet some of these you know

455
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,038
grassroot VC Growers that I [ __ ]

456
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,740
heard about read about didn't meet

457
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:14,819
[ __ ] one person from BC every single

458
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,339
person I met was from Ontario or I'd say

459
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:20,220
80 from Ontario and the rest were kind

460
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,319
of mixed so when you go out to uh to

461
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,160
Vancouver and the island and stuff like

462
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,798
that

463
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,480
you know yeah ask ask anybody where you

464
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,980
from I'm from BC I was like really where

465
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,380
were you born what part like I was born

466
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,419
in Etobicoke what the [ __ ] is that very

467
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,980
rare

468
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:37,559
six months ago well no you're not from

469
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,919
[ __ ] BC you know they all in the 90s

470
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:43,379
it was very rare like most people that

471
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,360
are from BC were born in the [ __ ] 90s

472
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,880
you know yeah like it just wasn't

473
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,298
populated it wasn't populated the

474
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,039
population was Tiny and like what I was

475
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,319
told actually I'm not sure if it's

476
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,319
totally true but I think it's believable

477
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:01,139
was like in the 80s they were offering

478
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:03,359
offering stimulus sort of situations for

479
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,520
people to move to BC because it was so

480
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,379
underpopulated and they were even like

481
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,879
doing that to like you know lower income

482
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,340
people like we'll give you money and

483
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,620
we'll give you a free trip to go to you

484
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:16,199
know the [ __ ] Vancouver area like it

485
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,219
just wasn't populated right so by the

486
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,580
90s

487
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,400
the great majority was not from there it

488
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:25,379
just that's it's true the Cannabis moved

489
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,360
out there again like why everybody moves

490
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,000
out there they think well you know it's

491
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,099
beautiful it's more climatized and so on

492
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,038
all the power to them for sure you know

493
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:36,480
but again the genetics and the the

494
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,058
techniques and the and the information

495
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,339
in their heads it's come from Ontario I

496
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,899
mean there's a a breeder out on the

497
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:46,678
island he thinks he's a pretty great

498
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:49,980
Gardener I think he's okay you know

499
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,980
um besides you know

500
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,140
um but he's not from [ __ ] BC you know

501
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,720
he's from he's from this [ __ ] town

502
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,220
you know but like recently maybe dark

503
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,500
enemies from here Chris Clay Chris

504
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,558
Clay's from here you know I don't know

505
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,058
about you know some of the other Growers

506
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,700
sure there's phenomenal Growers

507
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:10,558
everywhere BC definitely has but we're

508
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,120
seeing a lot of podcasts now right like

509
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:16,678
this where a lot of people are speaking

510
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:20,279
out and like see Ray not from BC scabby

511
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,620
not from BC Jay not from BC like every

512
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,980
single person that that has spoken out

513
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:27,418
about BC is not from BC right right I

514
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,339
don't think we've heard what I almost

515
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,220
moved out to BC I mean I got I got bit

516
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,720
by the bug also like everybody and

517
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,900
um just some beautiful [ __ ] people

518
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,460
out there and it is a lot stronger there

519
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,620
because the laws were a lot more

520
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,380
forgiving there it is

521
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:45,000
um but you know when it when push comes

522
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,740
to shove you ask the people like okay

523
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,079
where are you from

524
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,298
if they say BC ask them when they're

525
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,099
born because you know it's not like they

526
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:55,440
I'm surprised they got [ __ ] maternity

527
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,119
Wards in [ __ ] Vancouver because

528
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,500
nobody's from [ __ ] Vancouver but

529
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,959
there's some there's some right like

530
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,519
like

531
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,500
less than an hour I was off the plane we

532
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,538
were smoking texts at a time warp yeah

533
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,599
and like there was a whole bunch of

534
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:12,660
Americans there like like our whole like

535
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,538
deadhead crew that was in Vancouver like

536
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,480
we were strong supporters of the island

537
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:20,640
organic outdoor you know like that was

538
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,140
good [ __ ] it wasn't good yeah that'd be

539
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,538
a good story for red too if you ever

540
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,280
want to break

541
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:28,319
but there's a lot of cool people in BC

542
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,720
there's a lot of good growers in BC and

543
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,819
if somebody's like insulted at the fact

544
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,620
that like BC isn't everything maybe

545
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,500
you're not growing great weed if you're

546
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:41,759
that insecure you know yeah I mean I can

547
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,339
throw like obviously like I Mendo Mendo

548
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:48,419
has some similarities and humble too

549
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:49,859
because like as like you know you start

550
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,320
talking about like oh well where were

551
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,538
you born you know and I mean I'm a

552
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,240
transplant out here now granted I ended

553
00:21:54,538 --> 00:22:00,179
up getting here a lot earlier

554
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,980
um you know like uh than most people and

555
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,159
I've lived out here a long time but I'm

556
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:08,038
not from here right and you know when

557
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,159
you look at the map of Canada almost all

558
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:13,619
Canadians are from where you guys are

559
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,720
yeah yeah in the large population

560
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,519
Southwestern Ontario and like I was

561
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,798
saying before in the last podcast where

562
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,960
because of how we're situated the great

563
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:25,319
lakes and glacial runoff we have some of

564
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,058
the best soil in Canada I mean people

565
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,579
don't probably realize this oil in

566
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:31,619
Canada Canada is a huge place but like

567
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:34,980
that's mostly you look at it like I I

568
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:37,798
think it's like 80 90 of the people in

569
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,360
Canada live within 100 kilometers of the

570
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,038
Border or something like that even even

571
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,558
that I was I was kind of like well

572
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,359
because like Matt thought when we said

573
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,960
London we're talking about BC like his

574
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:51,058
geography is like way out but like

575
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,220
I was trying to explain to like my

576
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:55,980
American friends that like we can't just

577
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:59,519
say Ontario we can't just say BC because

578
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,500
it's too huge like BC right I was just

579
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,119
saying even the coastal area you have

580
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,400
all these independent islands that are

581
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,399
like a place in themselves then you have

582
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,960
Vancouver then you have like the the

583
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,700
Vancouver Island which could be split up

584
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,440
in sections then you have the Kootenays

585
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,480
which is like [ __ ] 12 hours down the

586
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,159
road that way like it's just totally

587
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,259
different places and when you say BC

588
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:25,620
like I'm sure the Coots had much better

589
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:28,558
um Quality because it was smaller and

590
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:30,899
the Vancouver area and the coastal area

591
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,298
was so big it was so commercial that it

592
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,240
was just it gets flooded with commercial

593
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:38,279
yeah it was so [ __ ] flooded with

594
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,319
commercial it was hard to find good weed

595
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,058
because there was so much commercial to

596
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,678
get rid of it was like nobody had time

597
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:46,079
to even think about quality it was just

598
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,900
like it's because a lot of the organized

599
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,279
uh Growers organized crime Growers yeah

600
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,259
that's where they were going to be

601
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:55,259
around but when you get into like the

602
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,480
Kootenays to Nelson area you know when

603
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:59,279
you get into the kind family mentality

604
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,860
that still grow For the Love of the the

605
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,899
plant so yeah again air quality the

606
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,000
movement people not the industry people

607
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,038
if you're in the industry you are going

608
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,500
to be in probably Vancouver uh you're

609
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,599
going to be someplace west of Hope

610
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,839
um and south of Whistler kind of thing

611
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:17,759
and then you uh get on onto the island

612
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,519
same thing you're going to get more of

613
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,038
the the kind family uh Vibe and

614
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:25,940
mentality right yeah I spent some time

615
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,960
out in Nelson and win law that area

616
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,440
and they were just like you know what

617
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,200
they grew phenomenal I named my dog yeah

618
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,960
it was called you know our friend our I

619
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,220
gotta mention because he passed away I

620
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,220

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,240
the people we grew up are there yeah

625
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:57,058
I would say like of that of like like my

626
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,819
age people that were brought up there

627
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:02,279
like 90 went to the Coots I would say

628
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:04,379
like the drum circles I used to have at

629
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,599

ended out in the Nelson area and

638
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,240

00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,278
kangaroo and those guys right like oh

653
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,419
Jimmy went with them Jimmy was with well

654
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:59,519
that because that when they all got

655
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,220
there they joined up with uh Wasabi

656
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,019
Collective like Jimmy was in there yeah

657
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,240
yeah so I mean that's what I was trying

658
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:08,339
to get at about you know the the

659
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,778
Cannabis industry and you know I invite

660
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:12,178
anybody that wants to challenge me on

661
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:14,519
[ __ ] you know East Coast West Coast

662
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,620
where'd all the Growers come like you

663
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,558
know you think about it

664
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,599
um yeah it's not a pissing contest you

665
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,379
know it's not a pissing contest you get

666
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,839
yeah

667
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,580
but it is for some right and like and

668
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,619
that kind of brings me into my my next

669
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:33,000
thing because when I talk about you know

670
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:36,418
Legend seeds right and and uh Sol

671
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,819
um they're from this area right yeah and

672
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:41,880
they're old friends and I I listen back

673
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:44,460
on my uh on the last podcast and I use

674
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,200
the words the term we a lot when I talk

675
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,140
about these guys because they're friends

676
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,620
yeah but when it came to their breeding

677
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,559
and stuff like that Legends and and Sol

678
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,219
um I was just I wasn't part of their

679
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:58,200
um

680
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,000
their company or part of their their

681
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,460
group I was friends with them I was

682
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,380
there I might have you know

683
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,640
um did whatever they wanted me to do

684
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,440
kind of thing as helping out a friend

685
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,659
but I wasn't ever when I say we I don't

686
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,038
mean I helped breed anything with these

687
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,380
guys that is a friend's Circle it was

688
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,079
like yeah it was and it brought me to

689
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,120
another point where in my book there's a

690
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,099
typo which I'm surprised

691
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,199
uh Steve hasn't

692
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,839
come and [ __ ] try to fire by my house

693
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,720
yet but um when we were talking about

694
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:29,879
the uh the fast fear which we spoke

695
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,900
about oh yeah you said that though the

696
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,900
last one you said this already

697
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,880
guys on the on the very last paragraph

698
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,880
of the one

699
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,340
um chapter it says I grew it was

700
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,900
supposed to say I grew an award-winning

701
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:52,558
strain okay and it said I bread oh no

702
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:55,259
train sure and but it taught the whole

703
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,700
chapter it just talks about me being a

704
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,619
grower and being a grower there and

705
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,798
working for Mr hemp and you know I

706
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:03,599
answered to Steve it was his program and

707
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,418
uh but the very last thing was just it

708
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,038
was a typo and Greg brought it up and I

709
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,980
was like oh [ __ ] man Steve's gonna kill

710
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:12,960
me because he thinks I'm trying to you

711
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,419
know yeah steal his [ __ ] Limelight

712
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,759
even though he stole my medal but uh

713
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,159
trying to Jack his STEEZ

714
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,278
you know I think that's a common thing

715
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,620
in cannabis actually because of how in

716
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,778
the shadows and clandestine it is yeah I

717
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:30,479
do the same thing dude where some of the

718
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,099
stories I tell where it's we it's like

719
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,259
there's people that are known and

720
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:36,000
there's people that are unknown some of

721
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,460
those people that are unknown wish to

722
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,380
remain unknown yeah you know and so

723
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,019
you're trying to tell history and tell a

724
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,059
story but you have to sort of edit it to

725
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,879
some degree because what you're giving

726
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:50,099
is accurate information right and then

727
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,260
the flip side of that is that there's

728
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:54,719
people

729
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:58,140
that wannabe can of famous yeah right

730
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,940
and they want to aggregate all the fame

731
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,980
to them and so even if it might have

732
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,200
been a collective of friends all doing

733
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,700
it they're going to tell the story like

734
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,400
it was them alone in their basement

735
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,840
working for 10 years and then they came

736
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,759
out with all this and no one else has

737
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,199
[ __ ] to do with it when you know

738
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,419
personally that there was like seven

739
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,980
other dudes and it was this loose

740
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,320
Collective of friends that were all

741
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,058
involved in this breeding happened at

742
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,918
this house then and then this accident

743
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,259
happened over here and then this

744
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,200
happened and it can be kind of weird to

745
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:31,019
tell stories that way because a lot of

746
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,360
money is made on

747
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,179
you know every breeder and mics except

748
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,339
for maybe Neville but most breeders are

749
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,278
like well no Neville was very clear

750
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:43,319
about I got this from this person

751
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:45,839
I did this and this almost all breeders

752
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:48,658
after him were like this never existed

753
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,119
before I carefully crafted it and no one

754
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,159
else has had any of these genetics ever

755
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,839
yeah

756
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:58,620
[ __ ] land race kind of yeah like like

757
00:29:54,839 --> 00:30:01,079
they just obscure yeah I'm gonna I'm

758
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:03,599
gonna break in because like not to

759
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,278
interrupt the flow but I didn't get to

760
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,500
actually ask my question when we were

761
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,960
talking about the BC stuff and I want to

762
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,880
ask this question do it so we're gonna

763
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,919
but it kind of is the same thing because

764
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,440
it's a dishonesty thing or like an

765
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,600
illusion thing I guess you would say but

766
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,798
like that conversation going back to

767
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,898
that conversation when you were

768
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,119
disappointed

769
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:25,439
um you mentioned something and at the

770
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,359
time you mentioned it I kind of thought

771
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,500
you were crazy like I didn't like I

772
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,819
didn't know because I didn't know right

773
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,159
when somebody tells you something you

774
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:35,639
don't know you're kind of like what but

775
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,919
you said something about High Times and

776
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,860
hyping

777
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,460
what's that magazine or the store

778
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:46,740
the magazine that like BC was only got

779
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,319
really popular because High Times was

780
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,579
hyping them to kind of draw attention to

781
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:53,460
them

782
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:57,298
do you remember this conversation

783
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,640
no no well what I what I remember which

784
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:02,460
this could be totally false was that you

785
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,200
were like BC was like hyping up the big

786
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,899
bud because at the time like BC was

787
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,980
really blowing up as like right but you

788
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,959
were like

789
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,179
the magazine was kind of like trying to

790
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,220
draw attention from the US and DEA

791
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,220
attention to to BC

792
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:20,759
um I don't remember that conversation

793
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,179
but I mean part of that sounded a little

794
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:26,879
familiar okay I think what High Times is

795
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:31,019
trying to pimp was because California

796
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,580
was such a huge market for cannabis

797
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,200
Counter Culture yeah right because High

798
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:35,939
Times isn't a candidates magazine right

799
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,980
it's a count of Culture magazine so

800
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,500
that's why it has so much music it has

801
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,120
so much uh cannabis is only a section of

802
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,500
it right and then for a few years they

803
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,719
got rid of it right they didn't have

804
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,339
canvas for a few years

805
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,980
um and that's when they started grow

806
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:53,579
America for for a little bit but

807
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,940
um I think because the term BC Bud right

808
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,819
anything Canada was BC Bud right right

809
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,740
right so

810
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:05,339
I think they were pimping that

811
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:08,099
as well as because of the climate you

812
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:11,158
could have larger outdoor grows than we

813
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:13,619
could in Ontario okay

814
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,880
um they wouldn't go into Quebec where

815
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:18,178
you could also have fairly large

816
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,240
outgrows because of the language barrier

817
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,538
um so I think for High Times

818
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,120
I wouldn't say I know for for a fact but

819
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:31,019
pretty damn sure with my interaction

820
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:35,579
with them that they were pushing the BC

821
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:38,940
Bud because of its popularity in

822
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:41,158
California because your top dollar you

823
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,399
know anything from your tuna cans

824
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:47,700
[ __ ] anything that was the BC bud got

825
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:51,079
the top dollar and okay and then I mean

826
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:55,679
I mean there's a name that we mentioned

827
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:57,599
uh in our last talk and he was a broker

828
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,600
he's still in the industry he's I think

829
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,418
he's a [ __ ] great guy he knows he

830
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:07,139
knows a lot of history of this uh of

831
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:10,679
this movement from the West Coast but he

832
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,919
was a broker and uh he used to sell be

833
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,640
able to sell a certain type of outdoor

834
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,019
and it was uh it was a pink something

835
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,340
but uh he was selling for twenty nine

836
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:24,960
hundred dollars

837
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:27,178
a pound for out to LA because it was

838
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,100
that's nothing though people were

839
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,899
selling 32.

840
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,158
for out yeah I realized that but this is

841
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:34,558
outdoor

842
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,899
um what year is this I was Canadian or

843
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,480
U.S what year

844
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:41,939
oh okay okay

845
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,019
the beaster era yeah I would say like

846
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,940
late 90s oh so like people and I it was

847
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,500
so it was strained I think it was called

848
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,200
sotica

849
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,759
cream sodica

850
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,700
yeah so we grew that out in Switzerland

851
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,619
actually yeah and uh the guy that's

852
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,058
growing it is a I'm gonna use the word

853
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,918
douchebag again which I said I was

854
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:03,658
trying not to use but this guy's a

855
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,380
[ __ ] douchebag he ran the uh farm

856
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:08,878
that I was uh hired to work on in uh in

857
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,878
the interior

858
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,079
and um his name's Jay I don't know his

859
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:15,960
last name I wish I knew his last name

860
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,699
but I'd say it here too what was the

861
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,398
cream sodaka like I the first time I

862
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:24,418
ever saw that it was really unique uh

863
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:27,480
plant uh it had really bright uh pink

864
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:31,138
stigmas in it where

865
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:35,099
um it wasn't a huge producer but it it

866
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,960
grew kind of like a really short kind of

867
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,879
like the pink freeze land which I

868
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,000
wouldn't be surprised if it might have

869
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,219
you know again traveled West which a lot

870
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,378
of genetics did back in the day as we've

871
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,878
talked about before that was just like

872
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,739
you know it wasn't a very strong

873
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,960
structured plant but it just grew all

874
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,398
these golf balls that would just would I

875
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,980
mean maybe a little bit easier to trim

876
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,838
but just look beautiful rock hard it

877
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,420
would give you the the BC bag of marbles

878
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,239
again it's kind of what I call a lot of

879
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,700
the you know any pot that comes across

880
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,559
my desk nowadays I can basically look at

881
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:10,679
it and tell you where it come from by

882
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:13,559
bag appeal because you know BC had the

883
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:16,199
tendency for a while there of not

884
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,779
trimming the pot but shaping it so every

885
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,779
nug looked like a [ __ ] marble right

886
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,839
yeah right you know but I mean if back

887
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,220
when they were making tons of extract so

888
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:29,039
they were trimming off a lot of the

889
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:30,899
stuff because they knew they were uh to

890
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,820
be able to use it kind of thing and then

891
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,220
you got the bag of marbles the BC bag of

892
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,400
marbles that uh was just kind of a look

893
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:41,578
so I think that the cream sodica was um

894
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,800
uh was a strain that was

895
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,800
kind of easy for their outdoor to look

896
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,240
like indoor yeah and that's why bubble

897
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,839
was able to [ __ ]

898
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,519
you know for ridiculous amounts of money

899
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,440
I mean that strain out here called the

900
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,139
West Coast dog like that it's just

901
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,240
outdoor for indoor type [ __ ] that's been

902
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,679
the game I mean and where I live in

903
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,679
Mendo it's like that's been the game

904
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,199
forever of yeah Brokers being like well

905
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:08,819
this outdoor pass is light depth yeah

906
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,279
does this light depth look good enough

907
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,838
to pass as indoor yeah

908
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,359
um because where there was uneducated

909
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,578
areas of the country or whatever they

910
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,098
were like can I can I put this into a

911
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:22,740
different bracket right can I buy this

912
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:24,599
for what it is but claim it's the next

913
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:26,519
grade up there's tons of people I mean

914
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,260
again that's the that's the industry

915
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:31,559
enveloping the movement the movement

916
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,500
right because there's going to be people

917
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,900
like myself that say Hey listen you know

918
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,780
it's outdoor it looks like indoor you

919
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,240
know but [ __ ] I I'm gonna be honest with

920
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,560
you and if you want to be dishonest

921
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,358
after that that's up to you but I'm

922
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,420
probably going to charge you

923
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,940
[ __ ] uh more money you're gonna pay a

924
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,099
[ __ ] tax on something that looks

925
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,440
spectacular I don't give a [ __ ] if it's

926
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:58,140
indoor outdoor or [ __ ] Greenhouse or

927
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,960
you know small crop large crop you know

928
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:04,679
hand trim machine trim you know like

929
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,139
there's there's so many variables at the

930
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,480
end of the day if it [ __ ] looks good

931
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:11,699
smells good and [ __ ] kicks you in the

932
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,699
nuts then what the [ __ ] who cares how

933
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:16,858
it's grown for me I think like what do

934
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:19,199
we what do we do when we grow indoor all

935
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:20,460
we're trying to do is mimic outdoor

936
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:22,559
we're trying to mimic from other nature

937
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,139
mother nature has the [ __ ] the

938
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,599
formula down where now we're able to

939
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:30,659
with technology and so on we're a lot we

940
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,460
can better mother nature but for the

941
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:35,480
longest time we were just trying to

942
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:38,880
reproduce Outside Inside

943
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,000
I do think we can do everything better

944
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,838
than nature indoor yeah except for the

945
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,119
Sun

946
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,578
no no of course you can I mean the sun

947
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,820
is the sun's still by far is the best

948
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,060
light right and I've done all kinds of

949
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,640
spectrum experience

950
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:59,039
and all this and you know to some degree

951
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,319
it's interesting too because like all

952
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,380
almost all of the award-winning hash

953
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:08,519
made in California is all made with the

954
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:11,280
Sun right you know they don't use indoor

955
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,320
grown stock indoor might get you know

956
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,460
humans are so visual that indoor might

957
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,140
look prettier

958
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,480
right you know

959
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:20,279
um and I I also wanted to make a comment

960
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,380
when you guys were talking about Ontario

961
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,119
you know just different areas there

962
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,720
could be a lot just for the simple fact

963
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,760
that BC Bud Rhymes yeah yeah you know

964
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,919
well yeah Southwestern Ontario nug

965
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,140
doesn't really like what do you what do

966
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,119
you call Ontario weed like so you know I

967
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,838
live in Mendocino County or whatever and

968
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,700
like

969
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,820
whether it came from Trinity or

970
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:44,519
Mendocino or Sonoma or or whatnot if it

971
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,760
went on dead tour it was Humboldt County

972
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,960
organic outdoor yeah exactly well and

973
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,200
that's what I was going to say like what

974
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,300
you were mentioning is you know humble

975
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,519
is the BC of uh

976
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,560
of the states pretty much right like

977
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:02,039
anybody that was anybody that wanted to

978
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,539
be a pot grower moved to California then

979
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,420
once they were like oh we're in

980
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,219
California now what do we do like humble

981
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,619
again probably didn't have a [ __ ]

982
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:13,500
Maternity Ward didn't need one because

983
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:15,720
there was only a few [ __ ] people that

984
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,280
live there and then all of a sudden the

985
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,559
Cannabis craze came and of course they

986
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,140
were like oh well I move up there I can

987
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,179
name it [ __ ] Humble County

988
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:26,519
yeah I'll tell you when I first moved to

989
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:28,919
Mendocino County in the 90s there was so

990
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,599
few people moving here from outside that

991
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,539
everyone thought I was a cop

992
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,240
yeah oh yeah also because because you

993
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:38,759
look like a cop yeah yeah yeah well you

994
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,379
know and [ __ ] that dude I I can tell you

995
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,800
I mean we want to talk about dead tour

996
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:46,140
the first time I saw a cop tackle

997
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,800
somebody on the lot with dreadlocks down

998
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:54,179
to his ass and then pull out handcuffs

999
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,519
yeah I was like oh yeah yeah no no I'd

1000
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:58,559
say you can't tell what a undercover cop

1001
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,358
looks like but you can tell what regular

1002
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,099
cop looks like yeah I'm like that you

1003
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,900
know but the only reason I said that is

1004
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,780
because it was before like what we call

1005
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,358
the green Rush yeah where people weren't

1006
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:11,880
moving like people didn't move to the

1007
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,098
towns that I was moving to yeah like

1008
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,500
out-of-towners didn't come there within

1009
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,900
five six years as medical Advanced and

1010
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,880
sort of the green Rush occurred it got

1011
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,338
overwhelmed by much like you were saying

1012
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,519
with BC yeah almost none of the Growers

1013
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:28,920
from Mendo were born in Mendo right they

1014
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,960
were all transplants I mean there was a

1015
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,240
small core certainly that was from there

1016
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,420
yeah but if you added them up by like

1017
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:41,159
number it was probably like 90 90 10.

1018
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,700
that's the same thing with BC like again

1019
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:48,679
I'm not gonna pull you know I I think BC

1020
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:51,539
had has produced and still does produce

1021
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:54,598
uh phenomenal Growers I'm just saying

1022
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,759
that back in the day most of those

1023
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:59,220
Growers and therefore a lot of their

1024
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,820
genetics

1025
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:05,519
um came from you know East or south

1026
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,460
I mean there's there's a debate on that

1027
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,619
too like not so much in but just in the

1028
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,720
sense of where is something from yeah

1029
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,160
exactly you know like like the you know

1030
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,139
we have this you know the whole thing

1031
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,219
came from came through it came through

1032
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:19,440
because there's this whole thing we're

1033
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:21,299
like oh the cush is from Florida

1034
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,858
well what's the story of the Kush and

1035
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,480
they're like oh well is this clone from

1036
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:26,940
the Emerald Triangle

1037
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,420
and then pollen from some stuff we got

1038
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,980
from Neville and Holland right but it

1039
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,159
happened in Florida

1040
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,440
right you know so I see and again back

1041
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,118
when I was growing the kush before it

1042
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,760
was kush kind of thing it was just

1043
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,460
basically the you know from the Kush

1044
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,200
region of Afghanistan like I would say

1045
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,599
if people say well where's the where's

1046
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:51,299
the Hindu Kush from well probably the

1047
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,880
Hindu Kush mountains right like these

1048
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,400
are they might have you know took a

1049
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,900
cutting or a seed you know they might

1050
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,700
have brought something back during the

1051
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,700
war times you know which a lot of the

1052
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:04,858
genetics did you know come from soldiers

1053
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:08,219
returning from [ __ ] overseas and

1054
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:11,699
bringing seed that they uh that they

1055
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:15,239
grabbed and planted in California

1056
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:18,000
Florida [ __ ] Wyoming anywhere

1057
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:20,759
everywhere it was just what ended up

1058
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,039
happening is where all the uh cool

1059
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,040
people or where the the population that

1060
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:28,619
were like-minded ended up moving to in

1061
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,838
Canada it would be BC you know in

1062
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:31,980
California it was going to be probably

1063
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,259
San Francisco

1064
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,858
or that area

1065
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,720
um

1066
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:39,900
following kind of the whole hippie

1067
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,279
movement and so on so I would say I

1068
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,619
don't say

1069
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,160
I shouldn't say that the strain oh their

1070
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:49,920
genetics came from uh Southwest South

1071
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,920
Southwestern Ontario I could say that

1072
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,960
they most likely came through and they

1073
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,480
probably came through California to get

1074
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,460
to BC but again when you get strains

1075
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,599
like Texada text at a time warp there's

1076
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,460
certain

1077
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,859
um and I was I found some seed that from

1078
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,500
Gabriola right like

1079
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:12,299
um where they come from I'm sure there's

1080
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:14,880
people on the island that will claim or

1081
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,119
and rightfully so say well Texada came

1082
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,760
from Texada because they came from

1083
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:24,599
California and we took uh we took pollen

1084
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,960
from Ontario or we took pollen from

1085
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,000
[ __ ] you know some seed that we got

1086
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,519
out of Africa you know I used to order

1087
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,880
seeds from [ __ ] Africa back in ham

1088
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:39,119
Nation days like literally from

1089
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,140
uh uh uh seats dealer out of [ __ ] yeah I

1090
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,800
think I don't know if it was South

1091
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:45,239
Africa the swazi and swazi pepper and

1092
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,880
there's another stream

1093
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,199
but uh you know I would use that in my

1094
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,420
breeding program

1095
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,939
I'm gonna put that in quotations again I

1096
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,900
would use that when I was making seeds

1097
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,420
and uh

1098
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,119
that made that strain from here right

1099
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,519
did it originate here yes the seed did

1100
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,920
but the genetics that it came from

1101
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:08,460
obviously didn't come from here because

1102
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,858
we have very little if any land races as

1103
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,800
same as BC has very little to any same

1104
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:16,739
as you know California they might they

1105
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,480
might have a land race there I don't

1106
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:22,618
know of one

1107
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,900
right but no land race no no I mean I

1108
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,240
think I think most most California

1109
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:30,119
breeding if I had to guess like what the

1110
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:33,539
very Inception of California breeding is

1111
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,700
it was like how do we make these sativas

1112
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:37,679
that we're getting free seeds with these

1113
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:40,679
kilos we're getting how do we make them

1114
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:42,239
finish in our area yeah oh well I have

1115
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,919
some Mexican and that stuff seems to

1116
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,598
finish earlier so maybe I'll take some

1117
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,059
of this Thai or Colombian and I'll cross

1118
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,940
it to Mexican yeah that was literally

1119
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,980
very like very it was very I don't think

1120
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,300
people had goals other than the fact of

1121
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,818
like I need this to finish before

1122
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:01,019
January well I think that's where a lot

1123
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:02,460
of the you know genetics were built and

1124
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:05,219
why they were built because I know and

1125
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,019
that's why again going back to the East

1126
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:09,419
Coast West Coast

1127
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:11,338
um we had draft Dodgers that [ __ ] ran

1128
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,039
the border and uh and brought their

1129
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:16,559
genetics up to Southwestern Ontario

1130
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:20,219
again because being so close to Detroit

1131
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:22,799
so close to uh Buffalo you know the most

1132
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:25,739
southern part of this country

1133
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,980
um the soil the so on so forth Perth

1134
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:31,139
County conspiracy the whole kind of deal

1135
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,059
um what were we breeding for what was I

1136
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:35,279
breeding for I wasn't breeding for

1137
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:37,139
anything other than I want to take that

1138
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,540
[ __ ] strain and grow it in my house

1139
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:42,719
in my basement and I don't want to run

1140
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:45,719
it for 14 weeks right so I'm gonna find

1141
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:49,500
so and again my a lot of my I miss I was

1142
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:54,299
a sativa lover so I wanted if I could

1143
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:57,480
grow uh an original Haze in six weeks

1144
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:00,180
that produced uh that one and a half

1145
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,338
pounds per light I mean heaven so that's

1146
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:05,219
where I was that's my whole program

1147
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:07,619
that's what it was about when I used the

1148
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:10,199
I used to read Neville's catalogs and

1149
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:12,838
Scentsy and God anything that was in

1150
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,419
that 45 to 50 day range just looked

1151
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,519
attractive it did and I just you know I

1152
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,338
I didn't get any I didn't believe any of

1153
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,559
this [ __ ] I really put the [ __ ] uh

1154
00:46:20,338 --> 00:46:25,619
the Amsterdam guys through a lot of [ __ ]

1155
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:28,920
in my years just because I called

1156
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:30,960
[ __ ] on a lot of them because I grew

1157
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,059
out a lot of their strains and I was

1158
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,000
just like this is you know I'm at 60

1159
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:38,940
days I'm not going to argue out of 55 or

1160
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,400
60 Day flower right that's fine with me

1161
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,679
inside but you're saying 45 today 45 to

1162
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,420
50 days and like yeah don't know about

1163
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,578
that you know and they'll give me the

1164
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:51,720
[ __ ] yields yeah I don't know about

1165
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:53,880
that you know like but again maybe again

1166
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:56,338
that's business though they need to they

1167
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,740
want to sell that seed and they want to

1168
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:03,179
sell that seed to be

1169
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:05,459
um attractive to the indoor grower or

1170
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:07,679
attracted to the North American grower

1171
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:11,400
who if they are going to grow outdoors

1172
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:15,000
they want it to be done uh in September

1173
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,619
they need it to be done by October you

1174
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,679
know I mean when you when you look at

1175
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:22,680
like California history before the

1176
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:25,379
helicopters people were fine with things

1177
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,000
taking into November right no big deal

1178
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,200
when there was no police pressure and

1179
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,179
they weren't worried about their crop

1180
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,799
getting chopped yeah November is fine

1181
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:33,480
all of a sudden you get camp and you get

1182
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,700
all these helicopters in the sky and

1183
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,519
they're like when can I pull down in

1184
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:40,139
September yeah that extra two months is

1185
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:42,480
a real prop three months is an extra

1186
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:45,239
problem we had snow that we had to worry

1187
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,880
about up here right like the cops the

1188
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,858
cops here go out in August right so the

1189
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,920
Choppers are there in August September

1190
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:55,199
maybe kind of thing right because uh we

1191
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,659
have to be down ideally

1192
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,239
end of September early October if you go

1193
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:01,858
anything past that bud rot and stuff

1194
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,419
like that you know we still get the

1195
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:05,940
humidity we are surrounded by the Great

1196
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,099
Lakes we get you know we get the cold uh

1197
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,599
the hot days the cold nights we get Bud

1198
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:12,240
rot like you wouldn't [ __ ] believe

1199
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,640
you know I believe I I believe it I mean

1200
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,399
I I think as as some of these states

1201
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,139
like New York and New Jersey and and a

1202
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,480
lot of these New England start to open

1203
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:23,699
up and what they want is they want all

1204
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,338
these California bread strains yeah I

1205
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:27,838
know uh because that's what's famous and

1206
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:29,940
they want to sell the name but what they

1207
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:34,199
really should be after is the Canadian

1208
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:37,440
bread stuff well they again but they're

1209
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:40,980
like we were saying before the BC bud is

1210
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,539
going to sell the SW Ontario Bud they're

1211
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,579
gonna what the [ __ ] does that mean right

1212
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:46,920
even the Quebec nug Quebec Bud they're

1213
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,720
gonna say oh I I know of Quebec they're

1214
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,039
not going to know of Ontario and Ontario

1215
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,299
is the biggest [ __ ] most populated

1216
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:53,219
state

1217
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,019
um it definitely by far has the most pop

1218
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:56,578
growers in it simply because of per

1219
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:58,739
capita the amount of [ __ ] maybe not

1220
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:01,380
per capita but because of the amount of

1221
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:04,500
uh people's population

1222
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:08,700
right but it's um it's going to be a

1223
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,619
hard sell to say Canadian Canadian buds

1224
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:14,219
it's all hot they're all going to say BC

1225
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:15,599
Bud right and it's marketing that's uh

1226
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:17,338
it's what's going to sell it kind of

1227
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,460
thing unfortunately or you know

1228
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:22,259
fortunately whatever to me I really

1229
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,659
don't could give any a [ __ ] of a less

1230
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,720
honestly but um

1231
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:31,139
you know it is it is hard for

1232
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:32,818
me here trying to sell down into the

1233
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:36,659
states

1234
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:40,380
unless they they knew me or they knew

1235
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:43,318
the uh genetics I was growing and High

1236
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:46,920
Times their office knew what I was doing

1237
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:47,699
because I used to fly down there with

1238
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,619
um

1239
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:53,338
weighed out eighths and wait out

1240
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:55,440
quarters in glass jars uh

1241
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:57,659
I also what was it it was a 25th

1242
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,599
anniversary party they had Cypress Hill

1243
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:03,539
and Joan Jett and whoever else

1244
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,920
um I supplied all the pot to that party

1245
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:08,460
because

1246
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:11,159
High Times couldn't really afford like

1247
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,920
back then especially the high-end pot

1248
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,139
all the super super nice nugs that you

1249
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,659
see in that magazine and you see Snoop

1250
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:20,699
Dogg with a big [ __ ] plate of buds in

1251
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:24,000
front of them and fake joints they rent

1252
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:26,879
all that pot they rent it they rent it

1253
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,818
rent you can rent weed yeah they rent

1254
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,818
weed for the Photoshop for the photo op

1255
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:34,380
and then anything that is smoked they're

1256
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:35,579
paying four or five six hundred dollars

1257
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,980
an ounce

1258
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:40,140
so they're just when they were telling

1259
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,539
me that uh they're like oh [ __ ] men

1260
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:45,118
they're all [ __ ] big fat

1261
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:49,400
[ __ ] uh blunt that's gonna cost us

1262
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:52,318
[ __ ] 300 you know what a bunch of

1263
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,000
clowns yeah I'll do it well you gotta

1264
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:55,139
remember what era it was though too I

1265
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,460
mean yeah it was it was it was

1266
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:58,739
ridiculous

1267
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,559
you know I know Sean was trying to get

1268
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:03,000
us to talk about like our our uh you

1269
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,880
know some of our Amsterdam and cup

1270
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,940
experiences because we overlapped but

1271
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:12,960
you know when I would go I went to three

1272
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:17,280
cups in the 90s I think like 95 97 98

1273
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,318
right right and what I experienced was

1274
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,980
that like you were just saying all the

1275
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:25,500
best weed was set aside for like the

1276
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,960
celebrities yep and the people that were

1277
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,699
gonna pay top dollar for it and the

1278
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,199
people that wanted to show up and like

1279
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,659
they didn't care if they dropped Mad

1280
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:38,279
Coin so it was actually like one of the

1281
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:40,019
worst weeks or months to visit Amsterdam

1282
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,700
yeah because if you were just a normal

1283
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:43,619
person they're like well we have good

1284
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:45,899
weed but we're gonna sell it for three

1285
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:47,940
times what it's worth yeah because uh

1286
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,559
North American Tax right you're gonna

1287
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,119
pay the North American Tax because we

1288
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,680
have all these celebrities coming in and

1289
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,079
we have all these musicians and stuff

1290
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,118
and these entourages right we've got all

1291
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,039
this weed and hash side aside just for

1292
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,380
them and we're going to charge them out

1293
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,940
the nose for it and so we can't give it

1294
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,900
to you unless you want to pay this like

1295
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:09,059
exorbitant price yeah and so it was like

1296
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:11,160
it gets ridiculous and again New York is

1297
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,900
the same way La was the same way New

1298
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:15,838
York and La obviously were the highest

1299
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,940
markets uh I think ever any place in the

1300
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,858
world and when High Times used to do

1301
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,900
like in the very back of the pages like

1302
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:24,318
the prices from around the world and

1303
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,760
around the country and how much a an

1304
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,858
eighth was and how much an ounce was and

1305
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,800
so it was always La in New York at the

1306
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:34,019
[ __ ] top kind of thing but with with

1307
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,280
um with uh with working with high times

1308
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:38,460
and

1309
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:41,640
Kyle knew my genetics like I said when

1310
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:44,099
he was coming here to buy it uh and and

1311
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:47,039
shipping it back to uh Detroit

1312
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:48,480
I would send uh I would send nugs down

1313
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,880
to him

1314
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,099
um and we had a thing going where I'd

1315
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,920
mail it to the High Times office

1316
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:59,300
and then inside I'd be like I hope this

1317
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,818
gets you busted you [ __ ] douchebags

1318
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:05,220
and and putting in all this you know

1319
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:09,000
hate mail with a half pound of pot in it

1320
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:12,000
kind of thing right and uh when the 25th

1321
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,318

1322

1346
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:06,900
than what they wanted for the party

1347
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:10,318
which was just a few pounds or something

1348
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:12,720
like that but I mailed probably

1349
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,880
at least a pound that was already

1350
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,399
weighed out and in and sealed in glass

1351
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,000
jars with [ __ ] homemade labels on

1352
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:24,240
every jar and I would uh I would mail

1353
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,719
them uh separately and then when I got

1354
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:31,799
down there I sat in Steve's office I was

1355
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:33,318
either bloomy's office or um

1356
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,818
um

1357
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:37,739
there's one other office anyways I would

1358
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:39,440
just I would sit in their office and

1359
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:41,818
they would come in like one at a time

1360
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,858
and choose I was like and I was like

1361
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:44,699
listen it's [ __ ]

1362
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:46,920
um

1363
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:49,019
I I think I was

1364
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,800
stiffing them a little bit I might have

1365
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:56,099
charged 50 bucks an eighth kind of thing

1366
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,680
um because I could and it was like

1367
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:01,079
I was shipping literally jars that were

1368
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,960
cured and it was like my my nicest stuff

1369
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,818
I got that's a risk I got to sit on the

1370
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,380
couch with Jack Herrera and I was super

1371
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:09,779
stoked because I was like listen Jack I

1372
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:13,920
want you to uh smoke this

1373
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:17,339
um uh golden Haze it's my strain I bred

1374
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,800
it but I used some genetics that you

1375
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:21,420
know with these nl5 skunk one that made

1376
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,019
his that sense he used to make his

1377
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,880
strain yeah um I used some of that

1378
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:30,719
uh

1379
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,480
uh I used a uh

1380
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:36,179
a version of keeping that kind of blend

1381
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,920
in mind because it was exactly what I

1382
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:41,039
wanted in my stream I wanted like I said

1383
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,858
before a short fat sativa

1384
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:46,500
giving high from a plant that's going to

1385
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:49,019
finish in less than 60 days and I could

1386
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:52,139
grow in a [ __ ] room with nine foot

1387
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:55,440
ceilings yeah and it was like when he

1388
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:56,818
when he you know tried my my stuff and

1389
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,579
he's like wow that's [ __ ] really nice

1390
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:02,338
tasty so on so forth

1391
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:04,800
I it made my [ __ ] it made my career

1392
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:08,099
at that time kind of thing just to get

1393
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:11,339
there and and smoke a joint with them at

1394
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,300
the same time having

1395
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:14,599
um

1396
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:17,760
who's the head of who is a Hagar Hagar

1397
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:19,079
yeah Hager yeah Stephen Hager yeah so I

1398
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,640
would I think I was sitting in his

1399
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:25,019
office actually because he was the head

1400
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:27,900
honcho and uh I was selling [ __ ]

1401
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:29,940
uh quarters and eighths and [ __ ] like

1402
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,980
that pre-jarred up to the entire staff

1403
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,900
kind of negative and then the party was

1404
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,599
you know that night and I was just like

1405
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,880
they paid me [ __ ] ridiculous amount I

1406
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,280
mean and I took less far less than what

1407
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,338
they were offering me because I was kind

1408
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,440
of honored one that I can yeah you know

1409
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:48,779
Supply the pot but I was also making a

1410
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,740
shitload of money by selling them my

1411
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,160
private

1412
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:56,098
uh Growers jar collection kind of [ __ ]

1413
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,618
so that's a testament to London because

1414
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:01,260
like you don't know how hard it is like

1415
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:03,059
being on on the internet and talking to

1416
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,880
weed guys trying to say that

1417
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:10,339
Southwestern Ontario had [ __ ] great

1418
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,338
pot nobody believed it nobody

1419
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:17,359
they have great pot man all you have is

1420
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:20,099
[ __ ] cities and cornfields but again

1421
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,719
it comes down to population when you

1422
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:24,900
when you have

1423
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:27,299
10 to 15 times the amount of people

1424
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:30,720
jammed into a certain area

1425
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:34,019
there's gonna be phenomenal pot growers

1426
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:36,899
as well as the

1427
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:39,659
the the people that really want to find

1428
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,059
that unique strain

1429
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,139
and they travel the world maybe not for

1430
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,359
pot

1431
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:47,400
but due to the amount of people

1432
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,739
the population they travel all over the

1433
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,019
world and if they [ __ ] find pot in

1434
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:53,519
Thailand or North Africa or someplace

1435
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:56,699
and like oh I got a couple seats I'm

1436
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:58,380
gonna throw in my [ __ ] in my shoe

1437
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:00,179
yeah and it's just because of the amount

1438
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:02,818
of people that we have coming back here

1439
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:05,519
and again why I would always say that I

1440
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:06,539
think Southwest Ontario produces some of

1441
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,659
the best

1442
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:10,858
pot growers and

1443
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:13,318
um genetics

1444
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:15,299
uh passing through

1445
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:17,759
uh in Canada

1446
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:21,420
a lot of that though is due to community

1447
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:25,619
building because like you know the hemp

1448
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:28,260
Nation thing like when that happened and

1449
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:32,539
you were offering what you did at that

1450
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,540
place a lot of people learned a lot

1451
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:39,599
it literally planted the seed for a lot

1452
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:42,838
of people right because yeah Chris gave

1453
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:47,400
uh gave people the option to buy their

1454
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:49,558
own seed not take bagweed and find a

1455
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,019
seed and not know you know what the [ __ ]

1456
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,780
it is we were we were kind of weeding

1457
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:56,880
out some of that we were telling you uh

1458
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,798
what it is we can we'll tell you it's

1459
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,380
going to be something within this range

1460
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:03,420
because it is an F1 we just took this

1461
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,119
Scentsy seed and we took this greenhouse

1462
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,960
seed and we grew them and this is what

1463
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,059
we got

1464
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,858
and the mother was this and the dad was

1465
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,480
this and this is what they look like and

1466
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:16,380
that's when they finished and and so on

1467
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,818
so we gave him an educated guess but it

1468
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,400
was literally planting the seed of

1469
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:22,558
people uh when I started that uh grow

1470
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,200

flyer that gave them a discount on grow

1474
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:34,980
guides and uh and then like I said uh

1475
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,500
information the best thing about

1476
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,240
information is it's free if you uh

1477
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,880
wanted to come down on the Sundays and

1478
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:43,379
we have cultivation talks you know I

1479
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,640
didn't mind sharing that I [ __ ] love

1480
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,280
talking that's what we're doing right

1481
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:49,259
now right like yeah we were doing this

1482
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,599
back in the mid 80s mid 90s kind of

1483
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:53,520
thing

1484
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:54,838
it's really awesome it's actually really

1485
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:58,380
hard for me

1486
00:59:54,838 --> 01:00:00,838
to tell people today with like what

1487
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:03,480
we're doing right now and all the forums

1488
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:07,259
and IG and all the ways that people can

1489
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,480
connect how tough it was to get

1490
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,079
information

1491
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:15,420
how how small groups used to be how rare

1492
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:17,220
it was to find people that like knew

1493
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,659
what they were doing

1494
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:21,000
um and then the other thing is like I

1495
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:23,460
always I'd still consider like 90s to be

1496
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,219
like the Golden Era of weed

1497
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:29,099
um just in the sense because

1498
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:31,980
basically any like weed was rare enough

1499
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:34,440
that it could take too long it could not

1500
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,659
look that great as long as it worked

1501
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,818
really well yeah it was going to gain

1502
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:40,739
popularity you know because there was

1503
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:42,838
there was only so much of it so like a

1504
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:45,838
lot of the famous strains in the 90s

1505
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:47,940
Rose to the top because they were really

1506
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,078
good yeah you know yeah and they didn't

1507
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,358
really have

1508
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,798
I think a lot of people nowadays you

1509
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,318
know

1510
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,759
um the placebo effect comes into play a

1511
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,199
lot with all these new genetics sure

1512
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,520
there's a lot of fire out there but

1513
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,039
there's people that are just like oh

1514
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,719
well this is this strain right oh this

1515
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,599

1516
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:09,358
of a Kush but it has a you know it

1517

1518
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,798
other yeah but since it since it you

1519
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,559

it's actually not kind of thing but so

1578
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,699
yeah we've been accused of using that on

1579
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:27,539
uh some of the blueberry stuff we put

1580
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:30,058
out

1581
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:32,298
the tasty Bud stuff like when people

1582
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:35,640
smell like good blueberry stuff yeah

1583
01:03:32,298 --> 01:03:37,440
this is a syrup I think a lot of people

1584
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:40,618
you know

1585
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,318
um and if you smell my B-93 like it

1586
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:46,200
doesn't it smells like uh not the

1587
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:48,420
blueberry smell but it smells like a a

1588
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:50,279
pint of actual blueberries right you

1589
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,159
know I see a little bit more that that

1590
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,440
sweet earthy Aroma kind of thing and

1591
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:57,058
again it's from it's from 93. that's

1592
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,460
when we started the seed right like it's

1593
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:02,460
an it's an old [ __ ] plant kind of

1594
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:06,420
thing right I got them I'm going back to

1595
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:08,780
that that era and it would have been

1596
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:12,780
I would I would have gotten indirectly

1597
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:15,420
uh okay or basically it was when he was

1598
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:17,280
first releasing his blueberries if I

1599
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,838
remember correctly I mean Tony could

1600
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,099
have had it earlier don't get me wrong

1601
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:24,838
but I think that Tony had with Simon and

1602
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:28,740
they had cerebral

1603
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:31,619
in 94. right and then they split and

1604
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:35,399
Tony made sag Martha and Simon made

1605
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:37,740
serious yeah you know but I think I

1606
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:41,160
think Dan I think DJ Short was with um

1607
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:43,199
Tony with Tony and uh they did the

1608
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:45,358
bubble gum and they called it 94

1609
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:47,578
blueberry if I remember correctly yeah

1610
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:49,318
he worked with Tony he sold it through

1611
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,940
Tony first and then they had some

1612
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:54,420
falling out and then I think he moved to

1613
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:55,920
Dutch Passion yes yeah and he got angry

1614
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,200
at all of them and then he and then he

1615
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,539
moved it to Canada yeah yeah yeah yeah

1616
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:01,980
and that's the thing is and this is

1617
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:08,039
where

1618
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:10,019
um he met up with Steve and red and I'll

1619
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:12,838
call him the air mechanic because I

1620
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:14,159
don't know of a nickname for him but uh

1621
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:16,078
he was uh

1622
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:16,739
great grower

1623
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,720
um

1624
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:20,879
didn't do anything huge like 12 lights

1625
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,318
or something but I I not if I'm not

1626
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,480
mistaken again red would be the better

1627
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,759
uh

1628
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,639
uh information on background on this but

1629
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,920
I believe they bred the blue satellite

1630
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:34,739
okay or I know they were doing a grow

1631
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,880
out for DJ and

1632
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:38,279
um

1633
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,160
but that was a little bit later so I the

1634
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,480
seed that I got was just before that and

1635
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:44,699
that's where I was thinking that it

1636
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,400
might have came indirectly

1637
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:49,679
from DJ

1638
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,260
um but it would have been like I thought

1639
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,000
it would I know it was 93 but I thought

1640
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,180
it was actually from him and not from

1641
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,159
from Tony from is it is it a clone

1642
01:05:57,179 --> 01:06:00,539
that's still alive yeah

1643
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,259
oh

1644
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:05,159
um

1645
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:08,220
I literally just killed off like six 75

1646
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:11,279
to 80 of my genetics yeah guys I'm just

1647
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,500
I'm retiring I'm tired really frustrated

1648
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,839
I was actually there today trying to

1649
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:18,900
salvage what

1650
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,119
um one of my staff

1651
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,680
uh from the center he's like if you

1652
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,619
could save me all these strains I'll

1653
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:28,078
find somebody to grow to to babysit them

1654
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:31,200
for you until you get over this divorce

1655
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,380
[ __ ] and if I wanted to go into it like

1656
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:37,038
out of the hundred and

1657
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:40,559
123

1658
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:44,119
123 strains that I had

1659
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:48,660
I had data collected on their use

1660
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:51,599
medical uses through the compassion uh

1661
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:55,440
Center going back almost 15 years yeah

1662
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,760
so because in Canada we cannot say well

1663
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,679
this trade works for this medical

1664
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:02,940
condition sure

1665
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:07,019
um what I could do is saying out of the

1666
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:09,539
30 people that suffer from Ms this is

1667
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:11,579
their the top selling Indica this is the

1668
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:14,220
top selling sativa I think that's

1669
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:17,160
responsible actually and it would just

1670
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:18,118
be basically giving them

1671
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:20,179
um

1672
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:24,079
well it's data

1673
01:07:20,179 --> 01:07:26,639
say again it's data to use I mean

1674
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,619
like literally for almost 15 years I've

1675
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:30,900
collected this that's the most important

1676
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:34,440
[ __ ] I had it all [ __ ] ready and

1677
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:37,019
packaged to go into the LPS up here and

1678
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,798
I just [ __ ] saw the dark side of the

1679
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:42,659
[ __ ] industry that was just chewing

1680
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,940
and spitting out anybody from the

1681
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:46,379
movement yeah and I took a lot of heat

1682
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,539
from people I think we talked about this

1683
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,980
last time from you know people in the

1684
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:51,859
movement that thought I sold out by

1685
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:55,858
going to um

1686
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:57,659
uh into the lb

1687
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:59,818
um legally I mean it's crazy because

1688
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:01,259
it's what you've been working for your

1689
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:03,480
entire life you know yeah it's like

1690
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,859
[ __ ] like that's [ __ ] crazy you

1691
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,079
can't [ __ ] steer the boat if you're

1692
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:09,000
standing on the shore [ __ ] yelling

1693
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:10,740
like get on the phone well I mean as

1694
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,179
like in the best Direction you can and

1695
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:15,779
that's what I was doing with my genetics

1696
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:19,500
I was like I can't I'm again

1697
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:22,679
strange names or names to me because I'm

1698
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,819
I'm out for the medical benefits of it I

1699
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:25,020
don't give a [ __ ] what you call it

1700
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:26,219
that's going to come back to the dog

1701
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,980
[ __ ]

1702
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:30,838
um where it doesn't it didn't really

1703
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:33,059
make a difference now I had a I had a

1704
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:35,899
strain that called warm diarrhea right

1705
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:39,539
oh okay wise

1706
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:42,000
really marketable yeah you know it was

1707
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:42,719
this one strain didn't produce was a

1708
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,479
[ __ ]

1709
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,600
but holy God Jesus did it ever smell

1710
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:51,659
like dog [ __ ] [ __ ] warm diarrhea like

1711
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:54,199
hot summer time [ __ ] diarrhea

1712
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:57,838
squirted like kind of smell yeah

1713
01:08:54,198 --> 01:09:00,778
[ __ ] I know it phenomenal

1714
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:02,818
it's like so I called it that I was like

1715
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:04,859
I don't I don't know what it is it's a

1716
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:07,620
[ __ ] clone that I went to I was

1717
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:09,359
Consulting a guy's Garden he [ __ ]

1718
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:10,979
said these are my strains I said where

1719
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,539
are they from he's like I [ __ ] you know

1720
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:14,159
my brother-in-law gave me some of this

1721
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:17,399
and some of that and I found some seed

1722
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:20,579
and this and that and this one [ __ ]

1723
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:23,579
one plant was like holy God Jesus that's

1724
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:24,119
nasty I Gotta Have It kind of thing and

1725
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:26,159
um

1726
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:29,399
you know with uh with Sam when he was

1727
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:32,099
doing his skunk and um everybody was

1728
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:33,059
like oh it's you know you that that and

1729
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,620
I was just having this conversation

1730
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:38,339
today actually with my cousin because

1731
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:42,000
he's like I had a skunk one back when uh

1732
01:09:38,338 --> 01:09:44,039
back when uh Tilly was [ __ ] growing

1733
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,298
for the center right and I'll find the

1734
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:47,759
picture because it made it was a full

1735
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:49,798
page picture in high times and it's this

1736
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:52,738
kid holding one of the nugs up and he's

1737
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:55,079
holding his forearm and the nug is twice

1738
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:58,259
the size of this kid's Forum oh wow that

1739
01:09:55,079 --> 01:10:01,198
was my skunk one and it's you know you

1740
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:03,000
grow the true skunk one I I believe is

1741
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,219
mainly grown for structure more than

1742
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,399
that skunky smell if I'm not mistaken I

1743
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:10,500
think Sammy was actually trying to get

1744
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:12,960
rid of uh and I think I was that's his

1745
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:16,140
claim yeah you guys will cover this you

1746
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,960
don't you don't follow like modern IG

1747
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:22,619
culture and stuff but like there's been

1748
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:26,340
a massive massive movement on finding

1749
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:28,859
roadkill skunk which everyone because I

1750
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:31,579
was gonna I'm making that this the

1751
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:34,500
cuttings that I sent out west today

1752
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:37,500
this guy and I don't know his [ __ ]

1753

1754
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,800
uh Sasquatch the kid that works for me

1755

uh who's like the Cannabis connoisseur

1756
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:49,320
he ended up getting

1757
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:50,879
um this [ __ ] jar of skunk one I

1758
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:54,000
opened it up and I was like

1759
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,520
holy [ __ ] that's my skunk one it smells

1760
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,658
like and I called it roadkill skunk one

1761
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,640
I didn't know that was a name called

1762
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:01,319
roadkill I was yeah yeah it's not a

1763
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,239
strain though it's just it's just a

1764
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:05,579
reference to a type of expression that

1765
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:09,359
can come from afghanis or skunky plants

1766
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:12,420
okay well this uh this skunk one grew

1767

1768
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,920
just said listen if you get it I want to

1769
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,579

1770
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,460
um

1771
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:22,380
it has

1772
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:25,319
the if it's the same cut that this guy's

1773
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,179
sending me I it smells the same the nug

1774
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:28,139
looks the same I have to find out if the

1775
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,719
structure is the same because the

1776
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,239
structure was what the the skunk one was

1777
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:36,300
all about like yeah have that big nug

1778
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:37,198
that [ __ ] can hold itself and

1779
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,140
um

1780
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,939
like I said this uh Tilly kid that was

1781
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,039
um growing and we're doing on an Evan

1782
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:45,839
flow cable and they were just spikes

1783
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:50,279
they were just these big beautiful

1784
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:51,840
[ __ ] fragrant roadkill smell uh

1785
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:55,259
skunk one

1786
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:57,480
so you know and I think I was I lit I

1787
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:00,119
try to put some of your guys podcasts on

1788
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:02,698
I don't listen to podcasts so in all

1789
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,079
honesty the first and only podcast I

1790
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:05,879
really listened to was like three nights

1791
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:09,738
ago when it was while I was going to bed

1792
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:12,719
and I wanted to hear what we did yeah

1793
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:15,178
and uh something else came up and you

1794
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,100
guys were talking about Sam's breeding

1795
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:20,399
trying to breed out the skunk one the

1796
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,320
skunk yeah you know actually and uh and

1797
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,719
uh focusing on structure and I was like

1798
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,719
that's ironic because that's what I

1799
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:31,380
wanted but I was also chasing that

1800
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:35,100
um that super skunk kind of uh Aroma

1801
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:37,619
yeah and it was this roadkill like Yeah

1802
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:39,659
because it doesn't smell like skunk when

1803
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:42,059
you spray it that tarry kind of burnt

1804
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:43,500
[ __ ] stuff it had that [ __ ] you

1805
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:46,140
driving down the [ __ ] road and you're

1806
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,840
like holy [ __ ] yeah you know that skunk

1807
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,980
you know yeah it adds that smell to it

1808
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,619
so

1809
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:55,198
um maybe I remember that from like

1810
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:58,260
London I definitely remember skunky

1811
01:12:55,198 --> 01:13:00,899
smells and like I I I kind of related to

1812
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:04,380
like the Heineken skunky beer smell more

1813
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:06,000
than animal smell right I have a

1814
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,940
question for you Sean this is totally

1815
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,840
off topic yeah does Canada get green

1816
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:15,178
Heineken bottles or brown greens not so

1817
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:17,940
yeah great no okay so check it out right

1818
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:22,140
so you can say Jesus Christ but I go to

1819
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:25,500
Holland in the 90s and they have the

1820
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:27,659
Heineken Brewery right is like was again

1821
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,698
it moved now like but it was in

1822
01:13:27,658 --> 01:13:33,839
Amsterdam and they gave tours you know

1823
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:37,198
and so if you buy a Heineken in Holland

1824
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:39,360
it's in a brown bottle right and you you

1825
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:41,519
talked you talked to like the the Dutch

1826
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:43,079
about it and I'm like well why why is it

1827
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,580
in a green bottle in America and they're

1828
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:46,380
like oh cause you guys are dumb but it's

1829
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:48,479
iconic over there so you want the green

1830
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,940
bottle but it oxidizes so it makes the

1831
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,500
beer go skunky and [ __ ] yeah yeah and if

1832
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:54,779
you get it in Europe it's a dark brown

1833
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:58,500
bottle okay because we don't want the

1834
01:13:54,779 --> 01:14:01,158
light to [ __ ] it up but that tastes the

1835
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,158
cost of taste

1836
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:07,139
oxidized skunky beer yeah so it's like

1837
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:08,460
and he's like you buy a Heineken

1838
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:11,219
anywhere in Europe it's in a brown

1839
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:12,600
bottle you go to the USA it's in a green

1840
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:15,658
bottle and he's like it's just

1841
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:18,600
advertising we have we have two we had

1842
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:21,658
two beers that were like the pot beers

1843
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,840
and it was Heineken and Moosehead

1844
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:26,939
and Moosehead was also in a green box

1845
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:30,179
you know but they both had that very

1846
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:32,460
skunky skunky like to get a six-pack and

1847
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:34,739
and some weed and smoke weed and smoke

1848
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:36,239
like and drink Moosehead was like that

1849
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:38,519
was the thing you know that was like

1850
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:42,178
they paired you know you guys are so

1851
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,980
Canadian bro yeah I mean I don't talk I

1852
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:46,880
haven't drank beer and

1853
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:49,559
like 20 years

1854
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,300
I I just I you know I just had to throw

1855
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,739
it out there because I was like shocked

1856
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,960
when they literally were like oh we only

1857
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,519
do that to the dumb Americans right

1858
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,719
that's like legit what they said you

1859
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,480
know and so I was like oh I guess that

1860
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:02,579
includes Canadians but yeah um what's

1861
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:06,178
funny about what's funny about the skunk

1862
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:08,939
you know uh is that like we're all so

1863
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:10,260
old now right there was this thing that

1864
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:11,819
tripped me out because you don't feel

1865
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,739
old in your head even though when you're

1866
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:17,039
getting old where I saw this thing where

1867
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:20,099
like the 90s are as far away now as the

1868
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:23,779
60s were in the 90s yeah

1869
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:26,579
right and so there's all these smokers

1870
01:15:23,779 --> 01:15:28,139
that like they all the stuff we're

1871
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:30,300
talking about all this stuff that's like

1872
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:31,980
our youth you know and you know in our

1873
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:34,619
20s and everything else that was so

1874
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:35,459
common this is all legendary just words

1875
01:15:34,619 --> 01:15:37,920
now

1876
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,899
the reason why they're hunting that

1877
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,819
skunk is because it's gone away and

1878
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:43,319
while it was super common in the 90s and

1879
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,500
there was lots of weed that was very

1880
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:48,539
skunky or had skunk type Terps

1881
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,479
it's kind of gone away

1882
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:53,519
you know and so now it's like you know

1883
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:55,919
we were talking about how BC Bud Rhymes

1884
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,199
or whatever but like Northern all these

1885
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,899
strains are coming back again and they

1886
01:15:58,198 --> 01:16:01,979
don't even have to be the actual strain

1887
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:04,619
anymore

1888
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:06,839
it just has to have the name yeah

1889
01:16:04,619 --> 01:16:10,140
because the name is going to survived

1890
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:12,179
the population the users are so young

1891
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:15,600
that they won't know the difference they

1892
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:17,460
don't know why I was smoking the NL back

1893
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,800
in the day

1894
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:22,679
um they're not smoking pot anymore kind

1895
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,659
of thing right so mark this down you

1896
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:26,819
know like the big the big strain back in

1897
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:29,639
my day was like the nl5 skunk one right

1898
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:31,679
like yeah that was the go-to that was if

1899
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:34,679
you know the center of the road easy to

1900
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,619
grow big yield depending on what

1901
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:39,600
phenotype you got you know it kind of

1902
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:41,519
was the best of all worlds and it was

1903
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,460
again it was an easy grower kind of

1904
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,739
thing but uh you know to find anything

1905
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:50,340
like that I think like pot now is so

1906
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:53,539
bastardized yeah I agree it's it's not

1907
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:56,819
as simple you know and sure

1908
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:59,399
my Matt well I did have another question

1909
01:16:56,819 --> 01:17:03,960
we were talking about the triple SC last

1910
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:06,539
time yeah yeah yeah right and so do you

1911
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:09,179
have have any contact to any of the good

1912
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:12,479
old boys that were part of that group

1913
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:16,260
yeah we interviewed them okay Corel the

1914
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:19,198
original owner okay now was he out of

1915
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:21,360
Amsterdam or very much very much so he's

1916
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:23,279
a Dutch born

1917
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:25,500
yeah okay so he's but he's not

1918
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:27,719
originally from the states uh trans he

1919
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:31,140

1921
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:38,760

1922
01:17:35,579 --> 01:17:40,260
their group in California no they said

1923
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,600

1924
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:44,940
United States ever now what now work

1925

1927
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:53,699

1928
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:55,500
their colleagues staff or something I

1929
01:17:53,698 --> 01:18:00,839
want to find out about the Golden Boy

1930
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:04,760
because the way I what I was told was

1931
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:08,400
that this strain came from

1932
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:11,239
Ontario and I I wouldn't say maybe like

1933
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:16,979
more up Central north of Southwestern

1934
01:18:11,238 --> 01:18:20,759
Ontario but it came from the triple SC

1935
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:22,619
or somebody from that group that is now

1936
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,020
living in Canada and we're going back to

1937
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:27,840
like like SSC didn't have a strain

1938
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:32,540
called Golden Boy either

1939
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:34,679
they had they had like M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6

1940
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:37,560
they'd have little names after but it'd

1941
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,440
be like Nigerian Kandahar or skunk one

1942
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:42,120
or uh

1943
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:44,879
basic five it was very very basic

1944
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:47,279
there's Williams Wonder small names like

1945
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:50,520
that no Golden Boy though

1946
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:53,039
can you ask them though like yeah if you

1947
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:58,260
can reach out just ask them because the

1948
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:59,420
story that I had was it came from

1949
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:03,600
from

1950
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:06,658
their group and I believe it was bred by

1951
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,699
them and it might have had like an M24

1952
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,539
or something yeah yeah

1953
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:12,359
um

1954
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:16,319
but and it was a it was a 45 day

1955
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:18,658
finishing plant and that's what was so

1956
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,099
was a [ __ ] crazy wasn't the best

1957
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:22,859
dealer it was a really weird looking

1958
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:26,940
plant but it was 45 days was it an

1959
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:28,920
indica or sativa it was I I would say it

1960
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:30,238
would have leaned I would say I wouldn't

1961
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,460
even say it was leaned either way I

1962
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:35,459
would have to look at some of the

1963
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:36,960
pictures that's so fast that I think I

1964
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,520
even have

1965
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,380
I might have the picture that's like

1966
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,179
Mighty might fast isn't it dude it was

1967
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:46,560
super fast it was ridiculously fast it

1968
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:48,600
wasn't a great strain on its own but it

1969
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,340
was great for breeding yeah and that's

1970
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,380
what I again made the and why it's where

1971
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,360
it's called Golden Haze

1972
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:56,460
um because there was other things and it

1973
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:59,759
was chemo and

1974
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,539
um uh uh skunk in it

1975
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,940
um

1976
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:05,880
and uh we crossed it with the golden boy

1977
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:08,099
because I wanted to speed it up but my

1978
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,679
my

1979
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:14,820
um what I was looking for was a fast

1980
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:20,940
growing short fat sativa yeah right so

1981
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:23,658
the um the haze it was a uh uh

1982
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:25,738
Early Skunk

1983
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:29,819
uh chemo

1984
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:31,678
crossed with the haze and then we

1985
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:35,219
crossed it with the Golden Boy to speed

1986
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:38,579
it up and yeah you know see all over the

1987
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:41,698
place I just I found one that seemed to

1988
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:44,039
fit the uh the mold I was looking for

1989
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:48,178
and uh I just caught I didn't have a

1990
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:50,939
seat of it I just had a uh a cutting of

1991
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:53,819
it yeah and then we did breed it with

1992
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:56,939
some other strains my buddy skifa

1993
01:20:53,819 --> 01:21:00,840
um who in 40 years passed away but he uh

1994
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:03,000
he crossed it with something blue string

1995
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,500
maybe it was even like blue sky got to

1996
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,479
look it up I might still have some of

1997
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,880
those seeds too but I just wanted to

1998
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:11,039
find the lineage of that Golden Boy

1999
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,199
because

2000
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:18,420
um I was told it came from the triple s

2001
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:20,399
c boys early 90s maybe mid 90s so they

2002
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,020
were done by then yeah they were done

2003
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:25,259
that's what I mean yeah yeah they were

2004
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:27,960
long gone by then um I'm thinking if it

2005
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:31,140
was Offspring from them yes and even

2006
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:34,020
being off literally Offspring for kids

2007
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:37,920
of theirs or something like that that

2008
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:37,920
moved to Ontario

2009
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:42,960
yeah I wonder I wonder if his son moved

2010
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:44,819
out there because his son took over the

2011
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,399
company eventually yeah he's the one who

2012
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:51,599
runs it now yeah yeah and then again

2013
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:54,479
this wasn't anybody that um

2014
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,640
I knew it was yeah sure that was a story

2015
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,139
that was brought to me and like I said

2016
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,640
the strain was a really unique stream

2017
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:01,440
but it was super fast and I was like

2018
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:04,079
[ __ ] we need it was going to be a

2019
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:05,639
breeding staple for us until we grew it

2020
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,100
out and we're just like yeah this plant

2021
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,739
is [ __ ] up look any kind of [ __ ] did

2022
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,420
you really weird [ __ ] did you like c99

2023
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:14,579
at all since you were looking for plants

2024
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,440
that were fast hazy uh I'm growing I

2025
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:19,679
haven't seen 99 right now

2026
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:22,698
uh came from this guy tank out of

2027
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:22,699
Toronto area

2028
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:29,880
um I

2029
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:31,039
did grow I'd have to look at my notes

2030
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,179
um

2031
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:35,340
it just tends to be one of those ones

2032
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:38,399
that speaks super fast it didn't stand

2033
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:41,520
out as the you know 45 day okay it was

2034
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:43,679
uh it might have been like a 55 day a

2035
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,179
lot of the stuff we do was like 56 day

2036
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:50,520
kind of stuff because we had 50 lights

2037
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:51,960
and I needed to produce I needed things

2038
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:54,179
to grow

2039
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:58,140
and finish all around the same time yeah

2040
01:22:54,179 --> 01:23:02,279
for the summer and uh we did we did do

2041
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:05,159
this Indy 99 it did have a um uh

2042
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:06,479
uh a following yeah wanted that we did

2043
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:08,879
uh we did want to bring it in

2044
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,919
Incorporated that photographer that you

2045
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,600
couldn't remember

2046
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,520
yeah Andre Grossman yeah somebody

2047
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,400
commented yeah I thought it was going to

2048
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,659
be male frame I think did I

2049
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:19,799
did I I said you notice I was like oh

2050
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:23,639
yeah

2051
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:25,920
but uh yeah Audrey Grossman [ __ ] I love

2052
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,360
that guy he was a phenomenal [ __ ]

2053
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,039
phenomenal him and there was another

2054
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,738
photographer at Amsterdam called himself

2055
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:36,960
Yap he he did like the first really

2056
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:39,599
micro trichrome photography oh okay and

2057
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,840
uh he yeah he shot through a microphone

2058
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,820
a microscope and uh he did some pretty

2059
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,860
interesting uh photography he was like

2060
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:49,500
one of the he was the first I think that

2061
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:52,259
did micro photography on cannabis but uh

2062
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:55,800
Roseman uh

2063
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:57,480
really nice guy uh super talented he's

2064
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:00,119
the one that shot uh Kyle's Special

2065
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:03,479
Blend poster yeah you know

2066
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:05,939
um and uh I lost track of him

2067
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:07,859
um I should try to find him I know I'd

2068
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:13,678
like to talk to him last time I spoke to

2069
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:16,198
him I believe was right after 9 11 and I

2070
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,940
called him I was trying to find him in

2071
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:20,158
more of a panic because being a

2072
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:22,259
photographer myself if he was in the

2073
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:24,179
city he would be the type of guy that's

2074
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:27,360
running towards the [ __ ] buildings

2075
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:29,819
yeah photos before they came down kind

2076
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:32,099
of thing so I was kind of concerned

2077
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:35,279
about uh about that but yeah anyways

2078
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:39,900
yeah we did a few uh I would say shoots

2079
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:43,259
together because he was well well more

2080
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:46,738
established than I was

2081
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:48,179
um but he did help me because I would I

2082
01:24:46,738 --> 01:24:50,579
would find out through him what he was

2083
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:52,140
getting paid and I said well like if

2084
01:24:50,579 --> 01:24:54,238
you're going to use the centerfold for

2085
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:56,640
me I want to get paid the same or so

2086
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:59,519
close kind of [ __ ] right yeah well back

2087
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:02,520
then like you did did you do school for

2088
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,260
photography yeah yeah I started uh

2089
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:08,219
did a three-year program here in London

2090
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:10,440
okay so like you were like early early

2091
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:13,079
cannabis photographer right how many

2092
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:16,379
photographers were around back then

2093
01:25:13,079 --> 01:25:17,779
yeah there wasn't very many of us like

2094
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:21,420
um

2095
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:25,738
I was Andre and I both were listed as

2096
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:28,079
contributing photographers uh in the

2097
01:25:25,738 --> 01:25:32,399
um inside cover

2098
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:35,460
right but he ended up getting lots of a

2099
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:36,899
lot more Centerfolds uh covers and stuff

2100
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,679
like that

2101
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:40,500
um

2102
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:42,060
and uh

2103
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,439
um yeah I don't I think he might have

2104
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,239
went to school I'm actually I just met

2105
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:47,879
with fanchon we're gonna I'm gonna put

2106
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:52,079
together a scholarship in my name

2107
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:53,100
ironically for uh the program because I

2108
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:53,760
want to

2109
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,679
um

2110
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:58,380
uh

2111
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:01,199
uh I want you know kids to know that you

2112
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:03,659
don't have to be a [ __ ] portrait [ __ ]

2113
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:06,000
photographer you know you can be a pot

2114
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:08,339
photographer and still make good and

2115
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,658
kind of you know even though I went to

2116
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,860
jail for it and [ __ ] like that I think

2117
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:13,079
it would make a good story for a

2118
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:15,539
scholarship but uh well like yeah cool

2119
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:18,119
in the last episode you mentioned like

2120
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:20,100
when you were at the border you got 10

2121
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:22,319
000 negatives like ten thousand that's a

2122
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,320
lot of photos man oh dude I had boxes

2123
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:26,158
and bought and I just found uh

2124
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:28,679
um

2125
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:30,420
I'd love to have you scan some of these

2126
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:31,980
like that did you have you ever thought

2127
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:34,100
about doing a book

2128
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:36,539
no no

2129
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:38,280
did you keep track of the strains in

2130
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:41,279
these pictures like did you write on it

2131
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:45,139
what stranger what I used to do

2132
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,139
um is I would take a picture

2133
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:50,339
um of the plant and then I take a a

2134
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:52,860
piece of paper and I'd write what the

2135
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:55,560
strain was and put it in the picture and

2136
01:26:52,859 --> 01:26:59,579
then I would do a shoot of that train

2137
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:03,719
yeah most ups and and uh full plant

2138
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:05,880
shots and stuff like that and then um if

2139
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:07,619
I if I liked it enough for and I thought

2140
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:10,619
High Times would like it I would shoot

2141
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:13,019
it on a positive on a slide yeah because

2142
01:27:10,619 --> 01:27:17,039
we had better uh color saturation and it

2143
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:18,659
was better for them to uh and then uh a

2144
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:22,198
lot of the times I would bring out my

2145
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:24,779
old Super 8 video camera and videotape

2146
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:27,419
what I was doing in the garden just so I

2147
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:31,198
would have reference uh because I was

2148
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:34,440
doing it for information for myself on

2149
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:37,559
different genetics as well as for for

2150
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:39,178
High Times and for future you know

2151
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,380
I mean that's going to be super

2152
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:42,359
important like I don't know if you

2153
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:44,340
understand that but because it because

2154
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:46,079
so much has changed and so many things

2155
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,819
have been renamed over the years it was

2156
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:50,158
a really prime time during those years

2157
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:52,259
to get Point like when you say like

2158
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,238
point of origin for like land race stuff

2159
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:56,880
this is like point of origin for a lot

2160
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,099
of these strains like in their natural

2161
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:01,859
habitat like getting pictures of let's

2162
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:04,380
say Romulan in Canada during this era

2163
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,519
that's very special we don't have a lot

2164
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,079
of pictures and things like that anymore

2165
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,420
when I was up there's a string called

2166
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:12,000
Biker Bob which was a big yeah I've

2167
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,920
heard of that out in California in BC

2168
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,319
for a while there

2169
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,119
um who has set up that I know I I did

2170
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:18,960
this shoot

2171
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:21,539
um

2172
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,460
with High Times in mind I think red set

2173
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:26,760
it up

2174
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:29,579
but maybe Mark uh no I don't think Mark

2175
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:32,340
set it up somebody set it up but like it

2176
01:28:29,579 --> 01:28:34,260
was up in north of Whistler and

2177
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:36,179
um I used to blindfold myself on all

2178
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:37,380
these photo shoots I wouldn't go to a

2179
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:40,619
photo shoot so actually if I didn't know

2180
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:44,159
the people yeah when blindfolded yeah

2181
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:45,599
you never be blamed or anything yeah I

2182
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:47,638
would just wear sunglasses and I would

2183
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,900
tape the inside of sunglasses even if

2184
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:50,579
they said I didn't have to do that

2185
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:52,500
they're like dude we know we don't want

2186
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:54,300
to pop up on that radar ever as someone

2187
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:56,279
I was just like you know what dude you

2188
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,960
have a list of and on that list is

2189
01:28:56,279 --> 01:28:59,819
everybody that knows about your garden

2190
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:01,859
yep I don't want to be on that [ __ ]

2191
01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:03,238
list if something goes south I don't

2193
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:07,678

01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:55,980
of [ __ ] and I'm so used to being the guy

2213
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:57,238
that you know back in the nation days

2214
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:58,738
I'm the one that had the pickup truck

2215
01:29:57,238 --> 01:30:00,059
with the topper on it that could fit all

2216
01:29:58,738 --> 01:30:02,039
the pot plants and everything in the

2217
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:03,719
back yeah yeah you know I'm not scared

2218
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:05,279
of the [ __ ] cops I mean I think I can

2219
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:08,039
outrun a lot of the cops especially back

2220
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:09,840
yeah so I was just like [ __ ] what are

2221
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:11,460
we doing what are you like how yeah what

2222
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,659
do you need to grab let's go you know

2223
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:14,100
and use those things but we need to take

2224
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:15,599
this down we need to shut this door we

2225
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,460
need to screw this we need to do this

2226
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,840
and I was just like [ __ ] right we

2227
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:21,119
were there for

2228
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,219
a couple hours maybe before the hydro

2229
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,319
people showed up you know because it was

2230
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:27,000
all I think I think he put up his own

2231
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:28,920
[ __ ] Transformer on a pole or

2232
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,719
something and and it blew their

2233
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,960
Transformers some so he was definitely

2234
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,639
like [ __ ] he's fine but you know we

2235
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,859
were just like

2236
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:38,819
we're here to [ __ ] hell I was like I

2237
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:41,639
don't want to know where your [ __ ]

2238
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:43,380
Garden is I you know so I'm blindfolded

2239
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:45,779
when I get here I'm blindfolded when I

2240
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:47,760
leave but while I'm here I'm your

2241
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:49,738
[ __ ] best friend kind of yeah I'll do

2242
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,300
whatever it [ __ ] takes but

2243
01:30:49,738 --> 01:30:54,658
um yeah I ended up

2244
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:56,159
um I ended up always you know even at

2245
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:59,638
that Garden I don't remember what the

2246
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:02,099
strains were because I think

2247
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:03,719
um one I was a little worried because I

2248
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,940
didn't know what I was walking into on

2249
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:07,739
this one there was a friend of a friend

2250
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:10,079
kind of thing and when I got there you

2251
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:12,479
could tell it was definitely organized

2252
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:15,420
guys on two wheels yeah

2253
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:17,519
I don't want and but the Biker Bob you

2254
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:19,500
know most of the guys that were riding

2255
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,179
the bike of Bob's road bikes yeah yeah

2256
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,439
it makes sense well I'm just gonna turn

2257
01:31:21,179 --> 01:31:25,500
on the light so you can see me better

2258
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:27,419
but yeah yeah did you bring your seed

2259
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,399
case with you

2260
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:31,500
I didn't I want to start going through

2261
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:33,599
it I didn't start going through it I'm

2262
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:35,520
sitting on my desk downstairs

2263
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,360
because I actually want to go through it

2264
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,699
all

2265
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:40,319
um I want to I want to go through it on

2266
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:42,779
the the video with you so we could just

2267
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:44,759
uh so it'd be easier I guess you should

2268
01:31:42,779 --> 01:31:46,738
just do a whole session on that yeah

2269
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,659
just do it again I mean yeah we have to

2270
01:31:46,738 --> 01:31:51,178
find like because a lot of the seeds I

2271
01:31:48,658 --> 01:31:54,059
have are just like

2272
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:56,219
seeds that came to me with a story

2273
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,780
that's the but that's the best part

2274
01:31:56,219 --> 01:32:00,060
right like that's what people want to

2275
01:31:57,779 --> 01:32:01,979
hear is the story so that's these these

2276
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,940
seeds can evoke a lot of these stories

2277
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:05,279
that you probably didn't even remember

2278
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:07,138
that you had about certain strains yeah

2279
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,340
but again like the Elmwood I've no one

2280
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:10,380
said no what the [ __ ] the Elmwood is

2281
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,520
right like the Elmwood is a a strain

2282
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:14,819
that was

2283
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:18,179
super popular in

2284
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:20,880
certain circles in uh uh Southwestern

2285
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:23,039
Ontario for outdoor right but after this

2286
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,840
people gonna be chasing it guaranteed

2287
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:26,340
people going to be trying to find out a

2288
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,719
shitload of those seats I'll send it and

2289
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:29,039
that's something else like I was saying

2290
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:30,779
is

2291
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:35,100
um yeah but see that's the same thing

2292
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:36,599
like now you know would would uh I'm

2293
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:38,460
gonna call him Double D because I don't

2294
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,539
know that's in Canada I used to work for

2295
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,779
him

2296
01:32:39,539 --> 01:32:47,579
um he's out on the East Coast obviously

2297
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:50,039
um but um if he would know about that

2298
01:32:47,579 --> 01:32:54,059
box story yeah I mean Ed would know

2299
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:57,479
about it but um I don't know too many

2300
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:59,760
people that want to talk to Ed yeah but

2301
01:32:57,479 --> 01:33:01,678
oh you're referring to to Rosenthal

2302
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,880
right yeah yeah because someone in the

2303
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,260
thing was like no he's referring to Ed

2304
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:08,340
Borg I was like no he's referring to

2305
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:09,539
Rosenthal nose board yeah yeah so yeah

2306
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:13,319
just because

2307
01:33:09,539 --> 01:33:16,979
um again that's what he told uh

2308
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:19,079
Miss for Hampton Steve when uh when he

2309
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:19,859
was working in Switzerland with those

2310
01:33:19,079 --> 01:33:23,760
guys

2311
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:25,859
yeah I think so you know again

2312
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,500
everything that we talk about

2313
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:31,439
is and I was just reading something

2314
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:34,859
today about uh the natives a native

2315
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:35,819
saying where you know people like you we

2316
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,738
wanna

2317
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:42,119
remember

2318
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:45,419
a purpose on this planet is to uh uh

2319
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:49,079
remember our Legacy or something and it

2320
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:51,779
should be to continue our story kind of

2321
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:53,939
thing and everything that we you know

2322
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:57,179
like we're discussing here as we said

2323
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:59,638
earlier was this is what I was told and

2324
01:33:57,179 --> 01:34:01,440
yeah a lot of this shit's just not

2325
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:03,359
written down it's not good and it's not

2326
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:06,000
going to be written down for obvious

2327
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:08,279
reasons so that's why you know when I

2328
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,139
get to meet guys like you I'm saying

2329
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:12,899
well if you know somebody that knows

2330
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:14,579
somebody this is what I heard yeah and

2331
01:34:12,899 --> 01:34:16,619
they might say yeah there's no way that

2332
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:19,500
happened and then say okay well at least

2333
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:21,779
I know now yeah well that's kind of the

2334
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,520
purpose of this podcast is that a lot of

2335
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:25,800
the history is oral like a lot of

2336
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,719
history is like verbally passed on you

2337
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:30,239
know and it always was it made it to

2338
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:35,460
[ __ ] down you know we had some carvings

2339
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:38,039
in the in the uh in the um uh on the

2340
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:41,100
walls in the caves you know and on

2341
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:43,198
stretched out leather but no we have a

2342
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:45,360
uh everything is you know it's around

2343
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:48,119
the campfire and tell stories and yeah

2344
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,859
hate that to the young ones and you know

2345
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:52,198
when I was at rainbow gatherings you

2346
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:56,759
know the granola Funk with the uh camp

2347
01:34:52,198 --> 01:35:01,019
that we were uh staying with and their

2348
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:03,300
contribution was uh building a stage

2349
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:06,300
luckily the one I went to I was able to

2350
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:08,820
help uh build a stage so the elders

2351
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:11,940
could come and tell stories about

2352
01:35:08,819 --> 01:35:13,439
earlier years of the rainbow and the

2353
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:15,960
history of jingle Gathering and I was

2354
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:17,579
like well [ __ ] you know we need that and

2355
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:19,439
that's what they said what I feel this

2356
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:23,399
is is for the uh for the Cannabis

2357
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:25,379
industry for the seeds is you know a lot

2358
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:27,299
of the [ __ ] this is uh this is what I've

2359
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:30,420
been told is what I hear

2360
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:33,360
and if we can find people to like I say

2361
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,880
with the triple s c Golden Boy story you

2362
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:39,179
know is that you know was somebody

2363
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:41,039
pulling my leg with somebody that told

2364
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:43,980
me this did believe it because somebody

2365
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,840
told them that yeah I'm still tempted

2366
01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:48,479
they go he's like the one person that I

2367
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,420
knew that was worked with Neville will

2368
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:53,099
help them

2369
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:57,899
I wasn't sure about using names yeah

2370
01:35:53,100 --> 01:36:00,179
yeah indeed okay yeah I think that

2371
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:01,679
I think he'd be that would he would at

2372
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:04,380
least know something I would think yeah

2373
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:08,340
so and like I said what the story was is

2374
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:10,679
you know there was uh uh somebody never

2375
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:14,279
was supposed to sell a uh a bunch of

2376
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:16,560
genetics to somebody never came through

2377
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:19,380
he threw him in the back of a freezer

2378
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:21,480
when he was pulling out of I believe

2379
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:24,840
Amsterdam

2380
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:25,919
um he came across them he passed him on

2381
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,139
to Ed

2382
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,579
supposedly for like an outstanding debt

2383
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:33,779
or something like that or maybe just

2384
01:36:29,579 --> 01:36:36,658
because he had him and they ended up

2385
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:39,000
um with Steve in Switzerland yeah and

2386
