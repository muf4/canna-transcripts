with the normal [ __ ]

24
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,000
you know how it goes

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,879
so um yeah there's a couple things i

26
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,039
wanted to talk to you about

27
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,719
let's do it one being

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,320
one being the jesus jesus uh the jesus

29
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,519
is super scum

30
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,079
candy to my knowledge

31
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,478
right you you stated it was super skunk

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,000
i think uh it could be a super skunk s1

33
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,319
we don't know because there's no chem d

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,599
coming out of the progeny at all in any

35
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,919
of the s1

36
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,919
um

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,879
that came out of a chemd uh mother

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,118
though chem the

39
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,478
flower i was told i was told by greg

40
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,680
that it came out of the super skunk

41
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:50,399
flower that the chem d hearn

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,079
uh i thought i i i was uh told the

43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,280
opposite but maybe

44
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,719
either one of us

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,599
either one of us could be robbed greg

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,599
didn't keep good notes as we know

47
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,359
right right and that's

48
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,519
from those guys you know him and the

49
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,280
weasel both you could ask

50
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,280
the same question twice and get two

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,439
different answers

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,719
that's a fact dude

53
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,479
right

54
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,800
but um but uh have you grown

55
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,799
the mass super skunk no i have never

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,840
grown mass super skunk never never had

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,920
it

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,878
okay because uh

59
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,238
you know

60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,759
with the speculation that the mass super

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,200
skunk is

62
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,399
with the

63
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,719
sour diesel i kind of have a couple

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
discrepancies about that

65
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:43,120
because the mass super skunk if you ever

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,319
grown it it grows kind of medium height

67
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,400
and it's it's a single cola with a very

68
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,199
thick stem

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,039
i mean so like the

70
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,119
the theory that it would be part of the

71
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,759
the chem dog um

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,560
with the chem dog making a sour diesel

73
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,519
uh the grow thought the growth structure

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,439
is just is way off

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,719
you know what i'm saying um

76
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,318
like if you ever

77
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,598
if you've grown cabin 91 that's the sour

78
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,878
diesel

79
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:20,000
like this the the growth the sativa

80
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,518
growth on the shower diesel is just

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,280
you know if you've grown it i don't have

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,120
to yeah yeah it's night and day from cam

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,318
91 sure

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
right so

85
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,039
so if the theory of

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,680
the super skunk went into it

87
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,759
then where does all that sativa growth

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,840
come from you know i mean unless it's a

89
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,280
recessive trait but

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,959
i kind of uh disagree with that because

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,080
uh i've i've grown that the dnl

92
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,598
that that i think that

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
is part of the uh

94
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,959
sour diesel and it grows

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,719
exactly the same just that really

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,519
stretchy sativa you have to top it off

97
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,039
and just branch it out and everything

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,680
all right

99
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,000
so that that's just my my yeah i i agree

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,840
with your ddnl and i saw a lot of sour

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,959
traits in it as well

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,560
i would agree with it right and i

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
thought and i was gonna ask you that

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,439
because i thought a while back that you

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
had uh grown some of those uh dnl

106
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,959
crosses and i wanted to get your i

107
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,879
thought it was good dude

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,360

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
working on that uh

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
i don't know i got to try to get into it

115

116
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,800

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
going on

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,879

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
like

him to suck his dick or something online

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,439
uh yeah but there was he went up to his

00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,399
booth

142
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,519
and they uh had some kind of uh

143
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,638
conversation and then he came outside

144
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,478
and i was in a circle with uh

145
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,439
the swamp boys

146
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,719

uh bronson was there and he just like

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,479
[ __ ] lost his mind you know i mean i

149
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,279
thought i was gonna have to fight him at

150
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,120
first but then but then i became like

151
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,918
his therapist

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
i mean

153
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,038
i kind of had like a a shred of uh

154
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,478
sympathy for the guy he was saying he

155
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,639
went to jail and

156
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,038
everyone hates him and how he wants to

157
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
be accepted and and all this other

158
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,199
[ __ ] you know you were the voice of

159
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
reason usually you're swinging

160
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,478
unless he stopped fronting i was like

161
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,119
you know you're

162
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,038
he's he's handing us you know a jar of

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
skunk around and i'm like yo you think

164
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,318
that's real road kill i told them i give

165
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,240
them you know some kind of skunk one or

166
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
something like that

167
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,360
like but when you smell it i mean it

168
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,280
kind of has that smell to it but the bud

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,038
structure itself is like very kind of um

170
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:43,198
leafy and sativa-like and then smoke it

yeah he brought it to emerald cup too

183
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,560
and it was uh

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
and the people that touched the

185
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
underside of the jar got some orange

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,560
[ __ ] on their fingers that smelled like

187
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,560
real skunk

188
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,720
he didn't have any of that going on but

189
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
poor fella you know

190
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,990
he's charting in dangerous territories

191
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:36,388
[ __ ] around with duke and skunk

192
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:36,389
[Music]

193
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,598
we'll see what happens at the next yeah

194
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,879
right

195
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,879
let it boil over a little bit

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
but you know but you know in there and

197
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,080
then there's all these other guys that

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,240
you know

199
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,120
you know say they have the the road

200
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,160
killing and i had the original super

201
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,639
strong back in like 1995 and let me tell

202
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
you when you just cracked that jar or

203
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,598
just permeated

204
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,839
you know

205
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,918
and then i had gotten to cut years later

206
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,478
it was just this wasn't the same it

207
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,079
didn't give out those same kind of terms

208
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,758
or whatever i don't know if a different

209
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,359
cut or the

210
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,038
you know you know

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,038
cuts just dud out after

212
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,280
and and it's starting to happen with the

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,598
sour diesel because everyone asked me oh

214
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,359
where's that that was that sarah diesel

215
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,719
at you know with that old time sour

216
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
diesel and

217
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
you got to figure it that's like 25

218
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,240
years that's how

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
how long that

220
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,639
that cut is now so

221
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,120
and it just been given you know from

222
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,519
person to person from room to room and i

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,599
think you know

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,799
cuts adapt to the room that they're in

225
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,720
so you know

226
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,278
your shower diesel is going to come out

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,120
different than my sorrow diesel now if

228
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,519
you start giving out cuts and i start

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,879
giving out touch you know after a while

230
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,919
i think there could be you know some

231
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,799
type of genetic drift that you know

232
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,039
might happen not anything drastically

233
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,000
but you know there's just seems to be

234
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,958
these

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,080
small subtle things that seem to be

236
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,159
missing from the from the sour uh

237
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,759
nowadays sure yeah i mean acclimates

238
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,879
from room to room to room to room and

239
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,958
that thing's so [ __ ] old yeah

240
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,240
right but i've had we had you know the

241
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:26,079
original underdog which was super skunk

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,000
now times in 91 it just went bad on us i

243
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,560
mean we had the cut

244
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,120
and then after a while it just

245
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,319
it only showed glimmers of itself you

246
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,320
know when it was really really good and

247
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,320
then we start you know the um

248
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,399
the harvest went down it was harder to

249
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,959
clone and everything and then after a

250
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,799
while my phone was like he gave to me i

251
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,159
did a little bit of work with it and my

252
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,000
phone was like listen i'm just going to

253
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,159
let it down yeah

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,639
but we just let it go you know and that

255
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,879
was it but i've heard up and i remember

256
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,360
just buying from buying weed there's

257
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,159
this stuff called the wheelchair or the

258
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
the wheelchair and back in the day

259
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,159
that [ __ ] you know

260
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,838
was giving you bomb and then

261
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,000
the same thing after a while you just

262
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,480
could not get the same batches

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,078
just from buying it after a while and

264
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,278
the same people were growing it and

265
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,639
everything but what's the wheelchair

266
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,759
i'm not sure it was just some type of um

267
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,799
local um strain that was sold in new

268
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,879
york city

269
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,039
in the back of the 90s

270
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,559
you know back then we didn't really have

271
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,799
uh you know

272
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,159
names weren't really

273
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,439
you know the thing that they are now so

274
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,838
uh yeah

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,399
i have no idea what it was

276
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,480

279
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,759

280
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,040
something like that and

281
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,200
i'm gonna have to uh really find out a

282
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,719
you know where that really came from but

283
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
i think that you know

284
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,360

you know going further back

311
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,278
he had invited us to

312
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:24,000
uh share his booth in one of the first

313
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:27,278
few denver cups it might have been 2011.

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
yeah i mean so um you know we you know i

315
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,559
always you know respected phil and you

316
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,759
know uh thanked him for you know helping

317
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,759
us and everything and so yeah

318
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,919
he needs to you know to play with and

319
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,679
stuff and um

320
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,559
so you know he grew those seeds out and

321
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,559
then

322
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,799
see this is where

323
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,799
it starts getting kind of fudgy because

324
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,759
oh no when i confronted him you know he

325
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,879
says you know that

326
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:03,200
he had started the seeds

327
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,480
and left mindful or i'm not really sure

328
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
but

329
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
we gave the seeds to fill yeah i mean

330
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,000
and then before we know it

331
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:17,600
uh one of his workers uh matt ross

332
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,879
um started a seed company basically

333
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,320
with the seeds that we gave phil yeah

334
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,720
phil

335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,519
phil claims that he

336
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,360
he stole him from mindful took him out

337
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,278
and started playing with him at his

338
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,720
house and all but

339
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,320
um you know we held us phil responsible

340
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
for that

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,240
and

342
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,759
he claims that but you know he

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,320
uh like

344
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,319
he hired the same guy to run uh some

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,040
kind of you know get some kind of job in

346
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,600
chicago

347
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,078
so to me i think that

348
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,159
you know he kind of set him up to kind

349
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,159
of be the bad guy

350
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,039
and while phil

351
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,799
spread those genetics all through his

352
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,120
his um

353
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,639
his you know his dealings with eight

354
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480

357
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,959

picked that one i picked this one i

503
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,798
picked that one

504
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,558
and um

505
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,558
when the weasel um

506
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,759
and he wound up um

507
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,439
getting i don't know like three

508
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,279
different finos

509
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,159
and and that's when i first met him in

510
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,720
central park he was selling skunk one

511
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,840
skunk two skunk three yeah that's what

512
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,600
he called them and then um

513
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,038
a friend of his

514
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,158
uh

515
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:45,919
wound up getting like some type of um

516
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,600
some nlc's and some hawaiian seeds

517
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,919
and i think that

518
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,879
uh he wound up having no siege and he

519
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,280
gave him uh one of some of those

520
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,159
uh rfk clones

521
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,079
and so he he made his own stream by

522
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,200
combining the three

523
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,839
and he just called it the nl but

524
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,480
you know it might have had some l in it

525
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,918
but it was mostly sativa dominant in in

526
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
structure

527
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,480
and you know and the uh the hawaiian it

528
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,200
kind of had these tropical like

529
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
tropical skunky tones a little bit yeah

530
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,720
i mean

531
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,480
kind of you get you get little bits

532
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,480
you know you could taste in a sour

533
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,919
sometimes you mean

534
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,120
um

535
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,280
so you know so that was a strain that he

536
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,759
grew exclusively

537
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,759
and i think that he gave it back to

538
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,480
the weasel to grow

539
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,359
and

540
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,200
you know that's what what i just suspect

541
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,639
was in the room

542
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,679
when uh

543
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,038
you know

544
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,600
those uh seeds were made originally

545
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:59,519
weren't made but were found originally i

546
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,359
mean in the 91 because i mean i

547
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,480
you know i used to sell weed for the

548
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,798
weasel he grew it i sold it but he had a

549
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,640
few but he had vondo

550
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:12,158
and there were a few other people that

551
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,559
were that would weasel in and try to uh

552
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,640
to buy to buy because it was

553
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,558
it was like a race because i would you

554
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,880
know he would only get like a couple

555
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,839
pounds so it was like

556
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,080
you know

557
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,879
you just had to grab everything that he

558
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,759
had at the time just cashed him out and

559
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,880
you know this way you had control of of

560
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,919
all of that

561
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,520
because

562
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,600
you know back in the day people would

563
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,038
just come in and just want to buy it all

564
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,519
you know i mean and i would be like i

565
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,558
can't sell it to you all because you

566
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,720
know i i like to spread it out and

567
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,200
i would sell to other people that did me

568
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,400
favors you know man so

569
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
you know

570
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,080
when i get something

571
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,480

572

574
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,240
or that and so you could use it as like

575
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,798
a bordering tool

576
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,798
to you know get other favors from people

577
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,079
sure what do you know if the rfk's still

578
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,279
around or is that long gone

579
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:18,480
no that's been long gone yeah and then

580
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:22,558
really recently they lost the dnl within

581
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,558
the last like two years or so also so i

582
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,000
mean that's why i was thinking about

583
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,960
trying to

584
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,679
you know fall back on some of those um

585
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
seeds i've made yeah dude

586
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,960
let's see if i can pull anything out

587
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
that's like the original that would be

588
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,919
real cool real cool

589
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,120
because really i wanted to try to

590
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,400
reverse that into the 91 and see what

591
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,278
would happen

592
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,600
because

593
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,558
when i first started growing

594
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,119
uh

595
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,158
in like 99

596
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,959
you know i

597
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,039
you know i i had been selling wheat for

598
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,440
a long time and anytime i had some

599
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:02,158
anything that was super killing i found

600
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,038
seeds i would save them i mean yeah and

601
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,360
then

602
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:08,319
then at one time i had a you know really

603
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,879
badass collection from the 80s and and

604
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,200
all that and the cops took it i got

605
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,120
busted back of cakes and that into the

606
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,960
cops wearing a cake in it so i wound up

607
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,359
starting a new one

608
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,679
and then so i started that one and when

609
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,599
i started getting the chem dog you know

610
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,600
uh you know every once in a while you

611
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,079
might find

612
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,480
a seed or two in there so i would save

613
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,519
them and so when i started

614
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
um

615
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,960
i popped a few of those seeds and really

616
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,720
back then there was no really such thing

617
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,558
as the sour yeah

618
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,759
but you know but

619
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,319
you know

620
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,119
looking back i had

621
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,678
found some stuff that was very sour like

622
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,119
very sour ish you know i mean

623
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,798
and i remember i had um

624
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,038
i had

625
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,879
something happened i think that we were

626
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,038
we were we had to

627
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,760
close down the grill whatever and i had

628
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,558
just popped these seeds and i sexed them

629
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,640
and i grew them and then and

630
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,399
i gave the clone to my friend and i was

631
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,400
like listen i was like

632
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
i said the only thing i know that this

633
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,320
is like you know came from out of the

634
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,319
cam dog into female

635
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,798
and i gave it to him

636
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,480
and he grew it out and that

637
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,839
became uh the gua the guava but not the

638
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,558
guava of today i got

639
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:33,038
you he so he called that cut the guava

640
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:33,839
but it was kind of very sourish and all

641
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,640
yeah

642
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,798
and and he ran it and then eventually

643
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,799
lost it you know i mean

644
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:46,720
and then um years later

645
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:50,798
i wound up doing the star dog and i had

646
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,159
gifted my friends some seeds

647
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:58,158
to give to andre grossman the

648
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,799
photographer of high times okay

649
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:05,679
and he um

650
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:07,119
he grew him out and he found a fino

651
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,120
that was

652
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:13,519
today's guava

653
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:16,319
so what happened was um somehow while he

654
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,038
well what happened was

655
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,278
they liked that cut so much

656
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,240
uh and at the time

657
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,278
they had

658
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,000
at high times they had the um

659
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,079
kyle cushman strawberry cough yeah and

660
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,079
they actually had they had a plant they

661
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,839
had a plant in the

662
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,319
in the office

663
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,879
and like anyone that that went into the

664
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,720
office if they liked you enough they

665
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,760
would cut you off cut you a couple

666
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,839
clones right off the plant in the office

667
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,798
and let you go home with them

668
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,119
so

669
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,519
so eventually the same thing happened

670
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,719
with the guava

671
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,158
and

672
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,839
both the guava and the strawberry cough

673
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,320
became the

674
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,918
the office strains

675
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,759
so

676
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,880
years later like i was saying the same

677
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,000
guy that named the guava tells me

678
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,278
that he got the guava he got the guava

679
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
back

680
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,159
so

681
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,880
um

682
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,399
we

683
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,679
eventually find out that it comes

684
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,038
full circle back from the high times

685
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,600
guys

686
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:29,519
and so like um

687
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:32,558
that was how you know that the guava

688
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:36,079
kind of got its name of today though

689
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:39,359
uh but it was originally uh

690
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:41,678
some type of uh sour chem

691
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,599
something the original cup but i

692
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,759
remember it and

693
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,079
it was very soured usually but i don't

694
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,879
think well i didn't get to ever finish

695
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,519
it out actually well one of them i did

696
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
and then another one i didn't yeah

697
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,759
i mean i did get to finish one out

698
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,918
but then

699
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,720
i had popped another seed and that was

700
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,679
the seed that i gave my friend

701
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,839
but it came from the same batch of seeds

702
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,080
now

703
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,439
was the star dog guava similar in terps

704
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,439
or anything to the other guava

705
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:20,960
not really i mean the guava

706
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:24,720
uh of today is more comfor-ish

707
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,720
one of my things more like become full

708
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,840
where

709
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,360
the other one was

710
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,439
more more uh

711
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,639
kind of 91-ish

712
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,640
yeah

713
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,038
it's a little more fuel easier a little

714
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,679
more fuelly sorry

715
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,759
the original one was

716
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,240
do you still have any of those old uh

717
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,440
the purple afghan cross i think you did

718
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,440
a purple star dog with it

719
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,079
um

720
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,158
with a purple star dog with water uh i

721
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,918
think it was british empire's purple

722
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,480
afghan yeah i did i never really um i

723
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,919
never popped any of those seeds i do i'm

724
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,360
sitting on them

725
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,799
and i think i did some into the chemd oh

726
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,038
wow

727
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,200
and i think i did some into the original

728
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,359
haze too those all could be real that

729
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,798
afghan original haze could be [ __ ]

730
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,479
real interesting

731
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:22,960
i i wound up um

732
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,360
flowering out some of that stuff and

733
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,440
some of it was green and some of it was

734
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:32,079
purple just by zoom out yes you know

735
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,880
and uh i wound up using a male and you

736
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,359
know i [ __ ] up and never made f2s out

737
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,000
of that you know

738
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:43,278
but i do have that just just the crosses

739
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,960
into the star dog and the chem dude yeah

740
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,960
that would be fascinating to see pop

741
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,079
back up

742
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,360
yeah but the the purple star dog that i

743
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,839
uh that i me you know the purple came

744
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,000
from the trade dog mail

745
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,278
and and the purple probably came from

746
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,640
the afghan and that bass danny was a uh

747
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,880
scentsy seed uh afghan

748
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,600
field afghani one

749
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,600
afghan one yeah and i think you know

750
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,000
looking back into that that wasn't

751
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,678
really like a true

752
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,038
uh

753
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,759
uh

754
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,640
cultivar as in one string i think it was

755
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,879
a mix of their best afghanis or

756
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,120
something like that

757
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,320
and then even like looking back into um

758
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,639
the the the maple leaf

759
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:37,839
i think even like the maple leaf really

760
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,720
wasn't really uh

761
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,079
really like one stable strain i think

762
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
there were

763
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,599
uh a variety of different phenos in

764
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,679
there

765
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,558
because there if you if you look back

766
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,360
into the the seed the seed bank catalog

767
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:56,398
they actually offer that

768
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:59,359
like a 50 pack or something like that

769
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,558
and it's more of like a breeders

770
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,839
you know i mean they don't really you

771
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,079
know i mean

772
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,240
but it sounded like you know there was

773
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,000
you know a lot of different different

774
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,519
varieties in there

775
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,798
but the one

776
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,599
guy that they talk about uh maple leaf

777
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,440
uh whoever they called one guy maple

778
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,240
leaf yeah

779
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,320
of uh you know the finos that he was

780
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,880
growing at the time so i guess all that

781
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,798
was based off of his stuff you know i've

782
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,559
always um found that a lot of the the

783
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,798
stuff that was listed as maple leaf

784
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,960
indica like that was used tend to look

785
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,278
like afghani one so i don't know if they

786
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,640
have a similar parentage that way back

787
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,038
up

788
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
i think you know because i look back and

789
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,919
i think you know if you look into the

790
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,640
catalogs on the afghani one it says it's

791
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,080
like a mix of their three or four best

792
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,919
afghanis or what or whatever you know

793
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,960
but when i grew it

794
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,278
it kind of it grew um

795
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,000
very fat stemmed

796
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,960
a single cola

797
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,278
kind of short medium height

798
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,720
and um

799
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,679
it didn't really have a really uh

800
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,798
the terps on it weren't really super

801
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,480
strong it was kind of subtle yeah

802
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,200
so that's why i figured it would be a

803
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,798
good out process to go and yeah yeah

804
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,038
i'll cross into the chem because it

805
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,519
wouldn't be dominant you know because it

806
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:29,200
kind of had like a kind of a madisony a

807
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,839
little madison knee popping

808
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,319
you know it was decent you know i mean

809
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,798
i i smoked the flower

810
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,119
but you know it wasn't anything

811
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,720
uh that would compare to the chem dog

812
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,798
but the structure

813
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
you know that you know definitely added

814
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,558
you know because it gave you that really

815
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,399
thick stem yeah

816
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:53,278
you know and and all

817
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:55,918
the all the um the calyx the blood ratio

818
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,960
you know there wasn't much leaf on that

819
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,880
so

820
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,440
you were you know you're one of the

821
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,080
first guys i saw from not necessarily

822
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,840
the modern era but um

823
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,599
prior to the modern era that was

824
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,398
actually using like the northern lights

825
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,119
the

826
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,558
super skunks the afghani one [ __ ] like

827
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,398
that and that always inspired me to go

828
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,639
in that direction for those bass lines

829
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,558
so i appreciate that

830
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,080
yeah well i was always a big scentsy

831
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:24,079
seed fan back in the day yeah i mean

832
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,079
their genetics are not the same

833
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,879
unfortunately

834
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,119
yeah

835
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,278
but you know but if you're looking back

836
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,678
most of that stuff they got from neville

837
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,119
yeah i mean all that stuff was seed bank

838
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,080
stuff that

839
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,759
you know when neville was in jail and

840
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,759
you know they bailed him out and

841
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,960
you know they gave him money or whatever

842
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,879
so

843
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,519
i'm pretty sure that that was the story

844
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,000
behind that yeah some of the best stuff

845
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,759
there is as far as baselines go i think

846
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,480
if people don't grow that stuff they

847
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,158
won't have an idea of

848
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,599
a lot of the traits and modern stuff

849
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,480
like they're they're they don't have a

850
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,359
good base knowledge

851
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,599
and

852
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,199
and looking back like i know people you

853
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,039
know they have talked to the drunkers

854
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,599
and they've admitted that they've lost

855
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,480
all their mother plants in the back in

856
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,480
the day

857
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,878
but you know someone like adam dunn he

858
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,480
was working you know with them back in

859
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,440
the 90s

860
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,679
and so he you know knows firsthand a lot

861
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,358
of that stuff that went on

862
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,800
uh

863
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:31,598
but you know he uh he you know he left

864
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,280
after he left that's real you know

865
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,039
and then uh i don't know who else was

866
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,720
doing i don't know who else was doing

867
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,519
their breathing

868
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,239
um

869
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,519
back in the 90s i'm not sure

870
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,719
but you know

871
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,159
because you used to be able to get those

872
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,118
cellophane

873
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,760
uh cord packs yeah

874
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,838
and then they upgraded to the box with

875
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,760
the bubble yeah the box in the bubble

876
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,440
all that stuff was junk

877
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,839
and leading up

878
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,000
leading up until today because

879
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,960
my friend he had bought

880
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,599

882
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,119
and um

883
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,119
you know he grew it out you know i was

884
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,358
selling the weed and

885
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,559
after a while uh

886
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,799
they need this kind of people got sick

887
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,199
of it you know i mean they started you

888
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,960
know they told them to stop doing it

889
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,118
he's like oh don't worry

890
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,079
i'll kill it i still have the whole pack

891
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,000
left

892
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,039

893
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,719

895
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,959
then i was able to grab a pack of the

896
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,879
boxes

897
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,889

899
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,960
[Music]

900
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,960
this way it just

901
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:52,239
[Music]

902
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,838
and you know i think really by then

903
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,559
that's when a lot of people started

904
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,838
outsourcing

905
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,599
to uh yeah

906
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:05,759
a lot of that stuff

907
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,519
comes back you know it's kind of like

908
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,079
jack knee

909
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,800
they have a jack turk to it but it's you

910
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,320
know it grows very sativa-like but it

911
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,320
you know it's kind of wispy and like

912
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,559
i don't know i just call it like generic

913
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,200
hamster yeah

914
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:26,159
and and like even like uh adam says you

915
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:29,279
know like that the the jack itself is

916
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,519
like i don't know like a 12 way cro

917
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,519
you know 12 way cross or something i

918
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,159
mean just

919
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,679
four things that just cross back into

920
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,799
each other and

921
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,919
after a while just becomes like uh

922
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,839
you know a

923
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,838
genetic like

924
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,960
meth yes where

925
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:50,239
this comes

926
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,720
it's just very generic in

927
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,719
in what it's producing becomes a muddled

928
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:55,719
mess

929
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,280
