00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599

Syndicate welcome to breeder Syndicate

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,079
I'm Matthew here today with seed trip

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,399
Rob AKA sub Rob as I knew him when I

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,960
first started talking to him um we're

23
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,039
GNA cover some stuff that we didn't

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
cover last time maybe expand on a few

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,160
things that we we kind of felt like we

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,000
should go more in depth on and uh I

27
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,079
think we're gonna start it off today

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,640
talking about San Diego's finest Cuts I

29
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,560
mean we we briefly mentioned how

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,920
influential it it was at the time and

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,879
and still is today but that was more as

32
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:21,000
a from the uh purview of my own but as

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:23,118
the scene as a whole that thing took on

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,959
a life of its own so let's start off

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,438
start off with what year did that kind

36
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,719
of start forming um why was there three

37
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,559
Etc let's start there I got I mean it

38
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,959
would be easy to look up but I want to

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,240
say around

40
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,000
2008 couple years after I signed up on

41
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,000
the

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,200
mag maybe 2009 n it was it had to be

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,759
2008 yeah yeah and uh it was it was

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,719
formed to Showcase and inform on the

45
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:59,560
cuts that g was bringing into the eight

46
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:01,718
was bringing into San Diego and pretty

47
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,320
much the rest of California running back

48
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:09,199
and forth North and South uh it was

49
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:13,878
started by dragor

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:16,679
and and uh a lot of the San Diego cats

51
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,399
saw the title and signed right up y or

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,280
her buddy of theirs and signed up on IC

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,560
mag just to keep an eye on

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,080
thread uh because like I said you know

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,239
we had a running list of what G was was

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,000
vending at the time

57
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,560
it was a badass threat right from the

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,639
start and it it evolved from there into

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,120
uh into General all

60
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:46,318
around everything threat but the theme

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,840
was mostly Cuts we were running in San

62
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:53,518
Diego and we were all on that trip you

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,439
know free the genetics at the time so

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,519
you know people were always bringing new

65
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,639
stuff

66
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,158
in and it just became inevitable that

67
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,639
people people would start spreading the

68
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:07,079
jeans and it didn't hurt G's business at

69
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,318
all nah no he he he actually sold clones

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,640
fairly affordably even back then like

71
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:16,039
you you weren't having the $500 cut for

72
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:18,719
this and 800 for that ridiculous yeah

73
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,719
the Raiders

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,080
won how how did the draft go by the

75
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:30,000
way I went well uh it was unexpected but

76
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,959
uh the Raiders got a lot of the depth

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,239
they needed to be able to compete and uh

78
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,360
it's going to be it's going to be a fun

79
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,360
season if nothing else AP is a coach

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,599
[ __ ] Max get the [ __ ] out of here now we

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,959
got well I won't go into it that's not

82
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,039
to

83
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,360
show one thing I could talk as much

84
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:55,039
about as cannabis it's the raid yeah

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,920
it's like me with the MMA and and [ __ ]

86
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,798
like that that's

87
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:03,679
an I guess I could talk about just about

88
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,560
yeah anything where man men get a hold

89
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,560
of each other and and and hold each

90
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,878
other exactly dude so yeah again I wanna

91
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,399
I want to stress that like you know I

92
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,199
don't think ape gets brought up a lot

93
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,198
but he was such a major influence on

94
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,800
even [ __ ] that I did [ __ ] that you

95
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,439
did how the scene blew up the entire

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
State you know even the big guys in and

97
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,199
up

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,800
north in the triangle they had access to

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,520
all kinds of stuff that other people

100
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,319
didn't of course but sometimes they

101
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:41,758
wanted something that they saw and and

102
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,240
able to give it to them yeah it it was a

103
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,879
lot there was a lot of difference

104
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,720
between what was going on up there

105
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,199
versus down in SoCal despite you know

106
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,840
like some of the the stuff that was sold

107
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,478
at Harborside would come down here but

108
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,918
there was still quite a big divide

109
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:56,680
between what we were growing you weren't

110
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,159
seeing a lot of like bull rider and Hogs

111
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,680
breath way up North being blown up in

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,680
Mass you know it was quite different in

113
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,720
Southern California I mean it was it was

114
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,959
big but they didn't it's not part of the

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,880
family tree of the Southern California

116
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:19,120
right growing was Northern especially

117
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:23,759
the bay like everybody knows the bay was

118
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,199
was purple crazy oh yeah back

119
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,720
25 I mean we could start with one of

120
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,160
those Granddaddy Purple when did you

121
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,319
first see it when did it hit the scene

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,919
down there you know I might have gotten

123
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:40,560
that from from a

124
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:43,560
um I don't remember maybe Sean or one of

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,199
the other guys might remember but it

126
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:52,918
wasn't the it wasn't one of the two main

127
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:57,520
GDP Cuts yeah uh son of bog later known

128
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:59,120
as great punched uh let me know that he

129
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,000
thought that the cut that I had cuz it

130
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,720
was small man it grew like freaking

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,680
Bubba it grew Bubba with slightly

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,479
smaller nuts I'm talking about that kind

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,360
of Bubba the one that just

134
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:17,000
stay uh it took forever to get there uh

135
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,680
was not a yielder but uh I guess it

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,759
resembled a cut that was known to some

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,240
people as the Royale cut

138
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,280
interesting uh and that information came

139
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,720
from I guess Colorado wherever wherever

140
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:38,000
great punch was based that was the first

141
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,880
I'd ever heard of the Royale cut yeah I

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,918
I had never heard of it but yeah it it

143
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:44,439
was different though for sure I remember

144
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,000
seeing pictures of like Ken's GDP being

145
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:50,240
all like pered out like like me like

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
magenta purple and the one down in San

147
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,280
Diego didn't look anything like that I

148
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,800
do remember the slow growth a

149
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:01,279
lot it was H more cushy it was more more

150
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,720
potent than the other two gdps that I

151
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:07,198
grew in San Diego which I was

152
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:11,479
not I was not necessarily that big of a

153
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,080
fan of uh GDP the purples I usually like

154
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:19,598
are those old

155
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:23,839
school purple stinky incense Afghan

156
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:26,319
Pakistani um not the fruit purple I like

157
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,038
that I always took you for a fruity guy

158
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,520
dude that surprises

159
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:33,439
me I guess that's how I come across how

160
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,318
how did the Grape Ape compare that went

161
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,478
around San Diego to the GDP the kind of

162
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,479
Grape Ape I had uh sucked I remember

163
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,918
specifically being very disappointed in

164
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:49,360
that I you

165
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:52,598
know while mislabeled Cuts weren't as

166
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,919
common back then yeah as they just

167
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,878
because sheer

168
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:01,439
volume I can't say for sure that that

169
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,439
was the great AP that uh

170
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,079
you know that made big book of buds or

171
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,038
or the can of Bible or whichever one it

172
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,598
was that had in it it was one of those

173
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:15,000
purple strains that doesn't turn all the

174
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:18,639
way purple it's got like purple streaks

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,519
through it yeah it had a very

176
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,918
odd this is how disappointed I was in

177
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,079
that I remember these details plus I've

178
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,478
been strumming through the forums

179
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:32,199
refreshing and I I saw a couple picks of

180
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:36,360
it and what wasn't purple almost looked

181
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,360
like uh it had

182
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:44,079
a goldish tint to it like when you pull

183
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,759
out some six or eight month cured Buds

184
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,959
and they kind of look to it not not to

185
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,278
the point of you know falling apart yet

186
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:57,159
where where you like it

187
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,958
yeah but it just uh it wasn't it wasn't

188
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,799
something that I ever grew a second time

189
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,000
yeah yeah makes

190
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,000
sense the

191
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:12,919
SR was

192
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:16,958
definitely runs on the ladder above

193
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:19,639
great I remember growing huge fan of

194
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,278
that either but it was it okay I

195
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,240
remember growing Urkel at the same time

196
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,799
as the SR71 and I could never tell him

197
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,360
AP part sometimes I would I would be

198
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,439
like well this one's a little more hashy

199
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,000
smelling or tasting as opposed to full

200
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,880
rape but that was like the only

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,519
difference I noticed SR71 grew a little

202
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,200
bit faster but not much I remember them

203
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,839
looking almost

204
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,640
identical you know well I hesitate I'm a

205
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,279
little more hesitant now to say I never

206
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,120
grew so and so because as I've gone back

207
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:51,838
to the forums to kind of get ideas for

208
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,919
what we should talk about I'm finding a

209
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,440
whole lot of stuff that I I completely

210
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:03,000
forgot I grew uh I don't believe I ever

211
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,959
grew early I do remember smoking uh

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,039
smoking it for a while because one of

213
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,359
the things we did on the thread was

214
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,919
after we had met you know each other got

215
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,240
everybody got to know each

216
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,000
other if one person you know was going

217
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,680
to

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,480
grow a couple pounds of one thing then

219
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,278
everybody else would focus on something

220
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,959
else and just get samples from the other

221
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:31,320
grows yeah getting purple arle from Sean

222
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:36,039
maybe

223
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:41,200
grotch think he grew that too so I I for

224
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:43,519
a grapy for grapy uh purple cut that was

225
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,560
that was Prett that one always [ __ ] me

226
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,839
up and made me I don't know I I never

227
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,439
liked the high from it but it always

228
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,600
smelled really good and tasted really

229
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,200
good so I'd always smoke it and end up

230
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,200
regretting it because it would spin me

231
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,200
out like in a real weird

232
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,480
Direction now I don't remember like I

233
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,600
said I don't remember how much we went

234
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,200
into to bull rider other than the um

235
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,519
just little bits of the story where the

236
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,000
dude from um I want to say

237
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,519
Fresno is where it came from and it came

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,360
down with old Betsy but other than that

239
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,039
uh trying to figure out much about the

240
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,440
story of bull rider was was a little

241
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,480
hard but there was The Afghani bull

242
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,000
rider that was big down in San Diego um

243
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,320
can you touch on that a little bit well

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
we have bull rider which was huge and

245
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,879
gerbo from [ __ ] yeah yeah gerbo recently

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,958
I saw on Instagram maybe it was an

247
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:38,240
Instagram story or maybe it was a post

248
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,599
and it's still there uh he he posted a a

249
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
small

250
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,000
short uh summation of where it came from

251
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,479
to the best of his knowledge and the

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,078
fact that the guy was a bull rider and

253
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,120
that's why there the Afghan bull rider

254
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:56,559
that was going

255
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,799
around uh it was popular to grow I would

256
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:05,000
assume because maybe maybe it was Elder

257
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:08,719
yeah space saber you know maybe the

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,360
Afghan shortened it down I was never as

259
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
big a

260
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,879
fan that was the weed that no matter

261
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,479
where you were drinking at in North

262
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,198
County somebody at the bar on to the

263
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,039
side of the bar always had a little bit

264
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:26,078
of Afghan bull rider yeah yeah um so

265
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,159
yeah it was grown it was grown by a lot

266
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,919
of people who probably all the people

267
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,879
who wanted to grow Rider couldn't get it

268
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,439
yeah

269
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:38,879
yeah was that bya Jeff Tech

270
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,720
first do you remember I know that Jeff

271
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:46,159
Tech was in that original crew

272
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,399
yeah or ancillary to it you know one

273
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,039
degree at the most separate um I don't

274
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,879
know if he's the one who found it I

275
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:56,360
heard that he grabbed it from somebody

276
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,720
else who was in the in the crew and

277
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,800
growing it in his

278
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,440
backyard Sean be a good guy to ask about

279
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,319
the history of that yeah yeah it

280
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,480
would there there was another seed that

281
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,920
got popped by Brandon

282
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,800
rust uh that's made of Afghan bull rider

283
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,319
in the last couple years it's made its

284
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:19,479
way out to uh a couple people in

285
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,879
California among them sea who's been

286
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,839
posting pics

287
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,639
recently uh and

288
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:29,600
it looks better Sean says it's better

289
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,519
hands down and he's still running in it

290
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,440
so that that whether or not it's good

291
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,120
smoke but you'd have to go there for

292
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,160
details maybe I should have hit him up

293
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,240
about that before I came on the show I

294
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,078
mean I I met that kid I want to say four

295
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,320
years ago now and he showed up in my

296
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,638
when I used to do the Instagram live

297
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,320
streams the rust kid and he he first he

298
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,839
came on claiming that he bred bull rider

299
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,440
and then I was like oh yeah which one

300
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,399
the Afghani bull rider bull rider he's

301
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,839
like what do you mean I said there's

302
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,278
there's not just one you know like he

303
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,000
didn't even know that there there was

304
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,679
something even called Afghani bull riter

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,399
at the time but later he then took

306
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,000
credit for breeding it so I've always

307
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,000
been sus as [ __ ] so anytime his name

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,919
comes up I'm like [ __ ]

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,440
clown I have to I actually I actually

310
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,120
well I never met the guy I don't know

311
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,120
the guy um and I heard when when I

312
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,240
started following him or I don't even

313
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,360
know how I can't maybe Sean pointed him

314
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,480
out probably some any bull riter I

315
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,720
noticed that sometimes you get into

316
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,120
arguments about stuff that is is from

317
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,639
the past like that yeah but he seems

318
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,198
like he knows what the [ __ ] he's doing

319
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,198
he seems like a hard

320
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,838
worker uh hard Hustler for sure he

321
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,838
hustles the [ __ ] out of people and yeah

322
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,600
I have no no love for that [ __ ]

323
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,759
yeah I I don't know one way or the other

324
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,320
I don't mind talk [ __ ] on people I just

325
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,320
I know you don't

326
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,320
and the only reason I know who Jeff Tech

327
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:07,198
was because I wasn't involved with the

328
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,959
you know with those

329
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:13,039
original transplant in

330
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:17,359
99

331
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:21,799
um but I know of jefftech because

332
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,440
when when bull rider in Canada launched

333
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:27,639
they pretty much right they were about

334
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,600
and I hit up Sean the local one of the

335
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,198
local San Diego

336
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,399
and uh and that's when I found out who

337
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,399
Jeff Tech was and how he was connected

338
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,679
up

339
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,919
north is he a Canadian Jeff Tech I don't

340
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,359
know he ended up there yeah that's what

341
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:50,039
I thought music producer somehow they

342
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,159
they were in the same Circle and MGH

343
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,639
bull rider back in the day that he still

344
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:59,480
still had the cut still growing it uh

345
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,039
and somehow turned it into a b Rider

346
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,519
brand the only thing I'm angry about now

347
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,159
because I reached out to oo and uh I

348
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,318
well first thing I did was reached out

349
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:12,159
to everybody I knew in San Diego and we

350
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:15,479
hit up bull rider Instagram

351
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:19,799
Pages [ __ ] hey do you even know what

352
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,519
you're just ripping off uh to his credit

353
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:25,799
OBO did reach out a few times and just

354
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,240
they never actually connected with gerbo

355
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,719
and him to history of the bull Rider

356
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,318
brand I mean if you look at the branding

357
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,560
it's the same brand that gerbo designed

358
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:42,399
originally for his loading and

359
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:46,518
accessories it's the same logo exact

360
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:51,000
yeah OBO did reach out so you know it's

361
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,440
on it's on gerbo to reach back out gerbo

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,839
is hard to get a hold of though

363
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,519
sometimes so I could see that what's

364
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,000
that jerbo has been hard to get a hold

365
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,600
of sometimes though so I could see that

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,639
being ask I've talked to him a number of

367
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,120

first I can't remember where I saw it

388
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,038
first but I do remember smoking it and

389
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,240
saying wow I would have and this is not

390
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,798
as insulting or as negative as it sounds

391
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,079
it was like I would have loved this [ __ ]

392
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:14,000
in high school you know what I mean yeah

393
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:18,038
yeah the first blueberry was the first

394
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,119
strain I ever had that was a tone

395
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:24,720
specific could be described as c yeah

396
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,879
but Green Crack just had that overall

397
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,279
sweetness that

398
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,120
uh [ __ ] delicious

399
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,639
and that was and I was already online

400
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,038
and that was

401
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,159
when that's when people would have the

402
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:41,519
debates you know there was the the

403
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,840
Cannabis

404
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,798
grammar guys who who insisted on calling

405
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:52,158
it this or that and not weed because it

406
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:55,240
had negative so it could be versus green

407
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,240
crack that that never that never

408
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,839
bothered me yeah it never bothered me

409
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,440
either but I saw a lot of it

410
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:05,480
well I do understand some of that that

411
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,400
old school you know speak about it

412
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,279
correctly yeah you know I that train of

413
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,840
thought and where that that whole small

414
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,599
movement started and I appreciated it

415
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,359
you know if you were speaking to

416
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:21,558
somebody educating them about cannabis

417
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,399
or informing them about oh sure then

418
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:24,720
sure call it cannabis you know if you're

419
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,720
on a

420
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,720
[ __ ] weed forum you know

421
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,440
right yeah um so yeah so uh that came

422
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:40,558
around uh which you had asked if we

423
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,480
covered green ice enough yeah yeah Green

424
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:47,279
was C

425
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,279
green uh he crossed green ice to gorilla

426
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:53,000
gorilla gold from breeder Brad and on

427
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,879
the last cast it was gorilla gold number

428
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,798
four in when I was going through the

429
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,520
forums I found out it was gorilla gold

430
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:03,038
number two

431
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,960
okay uh but that just made an almost

432
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:10,720
perfect sweet cannabis strin I mean I

433
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:14,279
don't think any of us gave it the

434
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,400
credit when we had it well as far as I

435
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,399
know calii was the only one who ever

436
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
grew it because again we were in that

437
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,960
Rush of strains for the first time ever

438
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,799
where you could have 20 different cuts

439
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,440
delivered to your house and smoke a

440
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:30,599
joint with the dude

441
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,480
yeah

442
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,599
right

443
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,798
um so yeah I I didn't high and

444
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:42,158
Lonesome who who's working with green

445
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:45,038
CRA oh yeah yeah high and Lonesome with

446
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,000
the uh Appalachia for sure I was putting

447
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,558
out s1's when I was down in San Diego

448
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,599
and that pissed a lot of people off

449
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,319
because everybody thought I was going to

450
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,439
take their clones and S1

451
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:58,240
it oh you know everybody was worried

452
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,120
everybody's still worried yeah for sure

453
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,440
for sure

454
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:06,239
sure you know CSI gave me great advice a

455
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,360
long time ago and he said don't ever tie

456
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,960
yourself to one clone because if you do

457
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,399
someone's going to get it and then

458
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,519
you're going to be real sad about it and

459
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
you're not going to have anything left

460
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,240
so never worry about tie yourself to one

461
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,038
clone so I've always kind of gone with

462
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,079
that but um yeah I remember back then

463
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,000
getting locked out of everything because

464
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,639
because I was a dude making fem seeds

465
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,599

467
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,959
the value of S1

468
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:41,520
seeds uh before I did because I passed a

469

00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,879
snd

494
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,199
yeah yeah that would be pretty fire

495
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,039
great cross I'll tell you this the ad

496
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,720
doesn't have the Flop the flavor that

497
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:05,400
you expect from or not that you expect

498
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,839
but that you hope from sour double yeah

499
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:12,038
but it doesn't matter because that

500
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:14,759
high to my physiology is so unique I I

501
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:19,798
love a is that still

502
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:21,960
around yeah yeah Diego yeah people need

503
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,158
to cough that [ __ ] up I don't think I've

504
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,000
ever grown a

505
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:30,000
dub well in in the era of turps you know

506
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,798
I don't think think it'll ever be a huge

507
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,440
strain yeah but in the era of smoking

508
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:42,278
flour and getting high like

509
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,120
concentrate yeah not saying strength to

510
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:49,119
strength but that type of high that

511
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:52,079
encompasses you know everything

512
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:56,158
yeah again I was never the best at

513
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:58,038
descriptions but everybody who smoked a

514
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,799
will tell you essentially the same thing

515
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,158
it it's a very unique guy yeah I mean

516
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,679
there's a reason they've kept it around

517
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,320
this long you know I think last time I I

518
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,720
called it it's like being high in a

519
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:15,278
bubble you know yeah until you finally

520
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,278
get out of

521
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,519
it um so there was one when I was going

522
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:24,240
through the The Strain list purple Joy

523
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,480
did that come via

524
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,599
ape no that was something that uh SPI

525
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,558
Sean

526
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,319
Crum

527
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:38,240
Source I believe but he did give it to

528
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:41,918
yeah yeah yeah was that's the kind of

529
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,159
purple plan I'm talking about man uh

530
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:48,200
that was a heavy

531
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:52,080
smoking like you knew you smoke pot

532
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,960
after a joint of that like yeah you let

533
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:58,329
your lungs breathe for a while and you

534
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,798
just sit back and enjoy that uh that

535
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:02,678
[Music]

536
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:05,000
I wonder if he got that from um breed

537
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:06,759
Bay Sean cron I'll have to ask him

538
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,359
because they were selling that a strain

539
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,759
called that at the same time but it was

540
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,719
some really weird like genetics that I

541
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,079
had never heard of at the time it wasn't

542
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,759
anything I want to say it was a nepes of

543
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,519
some sort but I I don't know if it's

544
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,119
even the same [ __ ] I just remember

545
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,119
grabbing it from

546
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:28,639
ape you know I seem to remember from the

547
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,158
photos and I just saw photos last last

548
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,120
week when I was going

549
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:37,000
through uh it did have a Sean posted

550
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,319
some photos from way back in the day

551
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,759
when he grew it outdoor and it had

552
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,720
a it had a different structure it was

553
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,480
not you know the leaf structure was

554
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,839
different the the branching was a little

555
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,720
different and I've

556
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:57,639
seen napy plants in pictures and

557
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,399
pictures only always seemed to have that

558
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,480
leafier

559
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:06,000
that same so it wouldn't surprise me if

560
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,599
it was some sort of of Nepali in there I

561
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,398
I'm sure Sean remembers you gotta get

562
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:15,278
him yeah eventually we got to get him

563
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:17,519
on um so one one interesting part I

564
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,880
think that would be I know we talked a

565
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,038
little bit about the beginning of

566
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,480
Gorilla Glue but going more in depth to

567
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:28,398
it how it was hyped why it was hyped how

568
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,558
it became as famous as it was was it pre

569
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:37,079
planned was it uh

570
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:43,158
accidental it wasn't really pre-planned

571
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:45,038
but there were people who hit Josie up

572
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:49,039
and were like this is what you know

573
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:52,798
cookies had was already in full on hype

574
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:56,960
mode yeah I wasn't even I wasn't even

575
00:26:52,798 --> 00:27:01,398
aware of Instagram at at that time yeah

576
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:05,960
that mean a lot but just to put it in

577
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:10,639
perspective um and there was a

578
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:14,440
guy Sunset limited maybe okay I believe

579
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,278
what his name was um before we ran his

580
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,960
ass

581
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:21,200
out we said don't don't ever come back

582
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,200
here

583
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:28,199
scumbag he I think he helped

584
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,159
doy a lot with advice and it was again

585
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,759
was all right there on the thread I'm

586
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,679
still I'm still catching up to that

587
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:39,278
point in my my

588
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,200
reading um maybe we'll talk about that

589
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:45,038
another time and I'll have more details

590
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,558
fresh fresh in mind yeah but it there

591
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:52,879
was in some sense a following

592
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:56,678
of the cookie blueprint for for hyping a

593
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,840
strain up you can see why I mean yeah it

594
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:03,720
didn't get hyped up

595
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:05,158
I mean it's still hyped up yep you know

596
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,759
there's got to be a

597
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,000
reason yeah to to there's got to be a

598
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:14,200
reason to last that long not not to get

599
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,398
hyped up first place yeah no for sure I

600
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,759
mean I I like Gorilla Glue I like

601
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,158
smoking it I like that one the one thing

602
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,359
I I noticed with it I I avoided growing

603
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,159
it for a long time because I was like

604
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:25,879
who the [ __ ] wants this poly hybrid mess

605
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,120
you know like this is where I want to

606
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,278
take any breeding but it actually breeds

607
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,038
breeds just like it looks like it it's

608
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,839
not all all over the place it actually

609
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,640
breeds like it looks and uh passes on a

610
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,398
lot of its best traits which which

611
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:44,240
always surprised me with with all the

612
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:47,479
crap crammed in it yeah it's uh it's

613
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,679
it's been on a wild drive you know it's

614
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,839
and there's a lot of poly hybrids with

615
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,038
it in it that I enjoy more than Gorilla

616
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,359
Glue which is the whole point of poly

617
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:02,919
hybrids you know yep did did you ever

618
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:06,678
get to try any of the uh gg1 gg5 any of

619
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:09,120
those uh you know I got to smoked some

620
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,159
of it

621
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:15,798
somewhere uh not enough not enough to

622
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:19,080
make any judgments versus number

623
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:23,798
four uh you know that's why when I was

624
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:27,319
getting invited to to judge in you know

625
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:29,119
certain events I always said no because

626
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,480
you know I don't really no string till

627
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,839
i've smoked like I don't know I figur I

628
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:38,000
got to smoke a half ounce

629
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:41,158
over over a month before I can even make

630
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,038
judgments on strin so I remember getting

631
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:48,159
high off of the I believe it was

632
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,879
the I think it was the number five the

633
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,159
yeah you know you had to sign a contract

634
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,840
or whatever that was that was number

635
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,760
yeah yeah yeah it was yeah I remember

636
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:03,038
being high but I I just I don't have

637
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:04,519
enough info to pass on any wisdom but

638
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,519
isn't that that is the hard part about

639
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,960
judging even even when we do our meetups

640
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,359
in the in the mountains and [ __ ] it's

641
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,079
like everybody dumps all this new [ __ ]

642
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,158
that a lot of us haven't tried like on

643
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,319
the table and we're trying to smoke it

644
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,120
all within two days and it's just not

645
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,000
[ __ ] happening to where you can

646
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,678
really pin down anything special and

647
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,319
there's there's people who can do it you

648
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,240
know there's people who can smoke in one

649
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,519
session four different kinds of flour

650
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,159
and just pop off and reel off their

651
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:37,359
comments and and you can tell they're

652
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:40,039
not faking you know yeah they work like

653
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,798
that I'm one of the guys I I gotta you

654
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:46,640
know I gotta know I gota know it for a

655
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:48,000
little while I yeah with me strains hit

656
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,399
me different at different times of the

657
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,440
day if I'm in a different mood like it

658
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,798
hits me all kinds of different ways so

659
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,798
for sure I I I get

660
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:03,080
that all right let's talk Master

661
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:05,398
Kush SoCal SoCal Master when did you

662
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,038
first see

663
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:11,319
it I've always called it dirty Bubba it

664
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:15,359
just reminded me of Bubba Kush crossed

665
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:18,798
with Master with a number of possible

666
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:21,158
Master kushes yeah you know a lot of

667
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,638
people still don't realize Master Kush

668
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:27,120
was a general term you know for for a

669
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:28,439
seed string or I don't even know seed

670
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,038
strings

671
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,679
yeah uh but individuals can always be

672
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:37,240
found in cush populations that just

673
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,080
stand out and somebody found that one

674
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,960
and I think somebody hit Bubba with it

675
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:46,480
because they grow very similar it's so

676
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:52,240
Bubba it's so [ __ ] Bubba yeah Bubba

677
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:56,120
with a uh just a garbage

678
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:01,399
reek you know finisher on that that

679
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:04,278
sweet rotten smell yeah of Master cush

680
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:06,158
or that can be expressed master I always

681
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:08,278
thought it was pretty good I like soal

682
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,720
Master I'd like to see it pop back up I

683
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:14,398
you know uh I haven't seen it in a long

684
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,600
time I've got some seeds on the burner

685
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:19,918
uh it's the it's when I hit SoCal Master

686
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,398
Kush uh with

687
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,679
revs I I can't remember I'll have to

688
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:33,599
look it up it's either

689
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:35,720
revs F3 bre mail of yeah or F4 pollen

690
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,439
which I selected myself from five

691
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:43,480
minutes yeah um and even though it's not

692
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,080
the ideal combination in my mind it

693
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,278
doesn't really matter because what I'm

694
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:52,918
looking for is is that Master cush I've

695
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:54,558
still got c99 seeds if I want c99 yeah

696
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,679
that's the only

697
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:01,599
seeds I

698
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:04,120
have uh left with the SoCal master I bet

699
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:07,719
it'll kick through that thing so it bred

700
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:09,359
so dominant um I know who was it it was

701
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,880
Jim Jimmy nits might have done some

702
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:15,000
SoCal Master Kush s1s at some

703
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,720
point

704

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,200
with silal

738
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,119

739
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,960
Killer cut too man that was heavy

740
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,760
rotation San

741
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,320
Diego um I'm pretty sure crch would

742
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,359
still chop off the fender in

743
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,920
exchange for that BHT hog breath if

744
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:17,639
anybody's got it I sent the last of the

745
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,320
seeds down to Bitter I don't remember if

746
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,799
they popped or not but I did find some

747
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,000
of the old little super hog in my

748
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,119
collection we don't have any proof that

749
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,760
I think you sent me some seeds might

750
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,519
have and we don't have any proof that

751
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:38,599
that was what that cut was but everybody

752
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:42,280
unanimously said that tastes like Hogs

753
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,559
breath and so it also had the look right

754
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,560
from the start purple leaves it would

755
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:51,719
get purple and if if the leaves

756
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:53,759
lay the under the the top of the leaf

757
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,239
that was under would not turn purple so

758
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,599
you ended up with all these cross

759
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:03,519
patterns on imprints yeah it was it was

760
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,119
another dang strain that I

761
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:09,159
wish hadn't disappeared because that was

762
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,079
great cut you know like when we made

763
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,759
those we made some like I don't know

764
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,039
15,000 seeds so it was going out of

765
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,800
unified he was selling them for like I

766
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,159
don't know it was like five bucks a seed

767
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,839
or something silly or five bucks a pack

768
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,399
so they should have been flying around

769
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:27,920
everywhere but who knows where where

770
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,240
they all ended up yeah yeah yeah that's

771
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,000
another one of those strands that if

772
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:32,879
there was that many seeds out there I'm

773
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,880
amazed there aren't more

774
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,240
Cuts right with with one of those two in

775
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,000
its name yeah and with with the way the

776
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:43,679
name game goes though you know it could

777
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,318
be out there under some other stupid

778
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,759
[ __ ]

779
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:52,559
name the super hog wasn't that creative

780
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:56,319
in the end in itself strain names are

781
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,159
not so easy anymore bro they're hard I

782
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:01,239
hate naming [ __ ] now

783
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:04,239
I like when uh cultural other cultural

784
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:07,199
phenomenons work their way into the

785
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:11,598
cannabis seed name game like uh I

786

790
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,838

kimd I mean I had it down path and

818
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,519
that's when I really started to notice

819
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:50,480
what I've always said about Kim D

820
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:55,039
because it's definitely in the in the

821
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,159
goat debate as far as I'm concerned sure

822
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:00,400
the fact that I still to this day have

823
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:04,358
not built a tolerance to it there is

824
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,039
weed that that I love that if I smoke so

825
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:11,119
long I just

826
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:15,639
don't it it just quits satisfying you

827
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:19,400
know whatever whatever physiology I have

828
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:20,598
uh but kimd to this day is one of the

829
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,559
most

830
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:25,880
potent uh CS for me out

831
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,480
there it's like that no seiling high

832
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,000
that people talk about like it's the

833
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,079
epitome of that I watch I've watched it

834
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
wipe people out that smoke heavy heavy

835
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,000
heavy yeah

836
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:44,679
yeah Sour Diesel which I guess is

837
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:48,039
related to kimd according to gab yeah

838
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:50,078
chem 91 vi vi chem 91 sure that's right

839
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:53,318
that's right

840
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,640
um East Coast Sour Diesel that original

841
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:58,880
East Coast Sour Diesel from the Kim

842
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:02,000
family uh was the per example of I could

843
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:06,358
smoke a lot of Esco Sour Diesel and I

844
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,838
did because I enjoyed the taste but yeah

845
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:11,799
at any point in smoking session I follow

846
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:14,960
up Sour Diesel with KMD it was like okay

847
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,880
I'm good yeah

848
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,079
right I love that flavor it's still the

849
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,240
best sour it's right there with sour d

850
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:27,680
those are the two best sour plants in my

851
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,639
opinion yeah I agree

852
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,519
lots of other good ones but I'm just

853
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,799
saying those two were

854
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:37,838
both you know Peak

855
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,119
Performance yeah we were spoiled bro we

856
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,838
had the we I think we had the best sour

857
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,680
down in San Diego personally via that

858
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:48,078
route Coast Sour Diesel that was all I

859
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,960
needed and then we had

860
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,920
sour why would you incorporate at some

861
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,079
point you have to draw the line and say

862
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,400
okay enough of this kind of plant let me

863
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,760
grow some of these others I want to get

864
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,480
too and if you've got those two you've

865
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,440
got both of the types of sour that there

866
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,000
are me you got you got both you got the

867
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,280
peak of both like OG there's many

868
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,318
different ogs

869
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,920
tons what's that tons of

870
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:23,440
ogs ogs that I still remember you know

871
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:25,720
to this day um s is the same way but to

872
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,519
me there's two basic profiles with OG

873
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:32,519
you got three or four basic profiles and

874
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:35,838
then variations on that I just smoked 92

875
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:39,559
OG for the first time how was

876
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,639
that it's I'm I'm blasted high right now

877
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:43,679
and I think I've taken three hits off

878
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:47,199
that bow

879
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:50,239
um the uh the New Mexico process of

880
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:53,519
drying and caring continues to fascinate

881
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:56,039
me and elude me really maxing but my

882
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,759
buddy here Uncle fishstick I got some of

883
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:02,480
that 92 9 to OG from I wasn't even sure

884
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,720
it was OG when I opened the bag and by

885
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,280
day three of being in the jar I was like

886
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:11,358
okay yeah there it is there it is it's

887
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,440
it's a dirty OG I don't know if it's a

888
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:17,078
cut or if it came from seed it there was

889
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,000
a collective that 92 uh came from

890
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,079
specifically that specific cut that they

891
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,519
started calling

892
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:28,559
92 okay yeah it's good it's it's what I

893
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:32,800
dirty ogs like Valley OG was it's notet

894
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:35,400
Valley OG was but it's it's that dirt

895
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,720
OG you were one of the few uh other

896
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,039
dudes that grew resin's cut of OG right

897
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:45,919
yeah it was Rascal's cut it was the same

898
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:48,440
cut that Ras same same same as far as I

899
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,358
could tell I mean I grew him years AP we

900
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,318
got the legit original Rascal cut it's

901
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:56,039
it's all on the thread cuz Rascal was

902
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:57,838
pissed we didn't know we weren't

903
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,480
supposed to have I remember I remember

904
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,639
all that [ __ ] and I remember how it came

905
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,519
down I remember when uh this dude Doug

906
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,759
had it he had it before Rascal was

907
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:09,960
really blasting it out big and there was

908
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,800
a whole bunch of drama on that yeah well

909
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,679
I guess there was a business deal or a

910
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,960
business venture that was going to be

911
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:22,318
formed between Rascal Wick 650 yeah and

912
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,880
another dude who's still around you know

913
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:28,558
W anymore um another dude who's still

914
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,200
around so I won't say is name but they

915
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,599
were going to do a business venture I

916
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:37,879
guess it fell apart and Wick and the

917
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,200
other dude got got pissed and Wick gave

918
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,039
his cutout to a few people among them

919
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:47,399
Sean yeah after some back and forth with

920
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,480
Rascal we just said look man we won't we

921
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,838
won't I won't make seeds with it we

922
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,639
won't sell seeds with it you know he's

923
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:57,480
like all right GL you guys got it and he

924
00:43:54,639 --> 00:44:01,000
was cool about it yeah uh that was a

925
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,240
great cut that was a that was a hydro OG

926
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,358
cut you know some gr and hydro and they

927
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,879
are Head and Shoulders above everything

928
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:12,039
else everything else

929
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,599
absolutely a Hydro Cut and few years

930
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:18,000
later when I ran resin cut resin's cut

931
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,838
me and the guy I was growing with time

932
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,559
we both as soon as we could smell it you

933
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:27,920
know we're like yeah that's

934
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:32,440
yeah the last Hy I ever ran was was Maui

935
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:35,960
skunk dog and resen OG and let me tell

936
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:39,039
you that was the stinkiest table in the

937
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,639
dude yeah the dren's cut is definitely

938
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,039
meant to be run Hydro he actually gave

939
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:46,318
us the recipe that they used to use when

940
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,679
they do like the cholo Mansions blowing

941
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,639
up Hydro tables and [ __ ] and it it was

942
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:54,759
like some I want to say jacks or

943
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:57,279
something like that or some some hard

944
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,000
hard nutrient line

945
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,200
I just used R water and Canon yeah Canon

946
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,599
that's what that's my fall back

947
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:09,480
too right you don't have well Hydro is

948
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,440
still Hydro you still got to control

949
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,960
everything exactly

950
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:19,000
butan I don't I don't measure PPM I

951
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:22,639
don't measure PH I just same not at this

952
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,440
point not this far in it's so

953
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:28,480
good all right day

954
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,639
recer day record day recer diesel which

955
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,079
was never really that dies to me no to

956
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,239
me it was more like a chem 91 OG hybrid

957
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,839
somewhere right in the

958
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:42,118
middle yeah yeah something like that not

959
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:46,599
quite as sweet as OG but uh

960
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:50,240
exactly grotch and I did a project we uh

961
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:52,960
he reversed the chem 91 and

962
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:57,879
hit I gave him

963
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,159
k91 KMD and Rascal's cut yeah

964
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,760
which yeah we made seeds but we did not

965
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:05,838
sell any seeds and this wasn't this

966
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,359
wasn't thousands upon thousands of seeds

967
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:13,078
anyway

968
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:13,078
um matter of fact those seeds got stolen

969
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:20,719
after um he hit and the day record

970
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:23,880
diesel so kimy

971
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:27,879
Rascal and original diesel got hit with

972
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:31,160
chem 91 reverse pollen yeah

973
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:35,800
um and that chem 91 was definitely legit

974
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:37,960
that came from money yeah money M and uh

975
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,440
we talked about that openly on the

976
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,480
thread so I don't think he'll mind that

977
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,760
being

978
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:49,719
known um and that we called that super

979
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:53,000

00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:09,558
ever I still have some seats but I'm

985
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:14,719
zero for the last six waiting for the

986
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:17,160
next step in seed cracking science

987
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:21,000
technology because there's

988
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,879
some a friend of mine had an eight in a

989
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,239
baggie he was taking it home maybe it

990
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,200
was a quarter it was a quarter quarter

991
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:30,279
ounce yeah and he had to go through the

992
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:33,679
checkpoint and they they went through

993
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,200
every surface of his vehicle after he

994
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:38,318
showed him there's the quarter out

995
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:42,279
they're like there's no way that's all

996
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,558
we this vehicle there's no way and they

997
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,400
they tore into they didn't tear into it

998
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:51,359
but they they searched yeah every place

999
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,680
you could put weed without tools

1000
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:57,318
and dude kept telling man this is it I

1001
00:47:54,679 --> 00:48:01,598
tell you you know I'm not dumb enough

1002
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:04,759
yeah more than this through a through a

1003
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,880
border checkpoint was it like Arizona

1004
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:12,079
checkpoint no it was just one of the

1005
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:14,640
many in North County gotcha yeah or

1006
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:18,119
Southern and and they're not border

1007
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:20,118
checkpoints you know we all the a

1008
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:23,119
checkpoints they're what the

1009
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:26,599
agricultural checkpoints oh they're drug

1010
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:29,119
interdiction checkpoints that's yeah

1011
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:33,760
well why are you doing immigration 880

1012
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,760
miles north border you know it's too

1013
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,839
late yeah that's one I would have liked

1014
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,920
to have tried I I'm a big fan of day wer

1015
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,239
as it is and with chem 91 on that that

1016
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,880
would be fire that' be super fire lots

1017
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,519
of

1018
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,119
potential chem 91 makes some killer

1019
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,400
crosses a lot of The Offspring I find

1020
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:55,280
chem 91 to be pretty boring I mean not

1021
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,599
the high the high is C sure you know but

1022
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,040
I I think it's rather boring

1023
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,920
D I think it's kind of ugly too on its

1024
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:06,798
own not too pretty not too yeah but in

1025
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,880
hybrids

1026
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:11,679
awesome yeah all right sensey star

1027
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,240
what's your first experience with Sensei

1028
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:18,000
star uh you know that's one of the few

1029
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:22,118
strains I've tried

1030
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
from uh from a dispensary in you know

1031
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:25,798
California it was one of the earliest

1032
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,079
ones in dispensaries that I remember

1033
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:28,719
like when dispensary started popping up

1034
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:33,640
ceny star was one of the

1035
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:36,358
first the bud being sold it was cool to

1036
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:39,519
uh you know we had all seen the Cana

1037
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:43,279
Bible yeah uh think I don't even think

1038
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:45,159
rosenthal's books were out yet um but

1039
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,079
we'd all seen the can Bible so it was

1040
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:49,798
really cool to go to

1041
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:52,760
dispensary and buy some pot that I had

1042
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:56,199
never grown or or smoked and just match

1043
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,760
it up with with what we saw or the

1044
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:02,078
beginning of the online sure you

1045
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,839
know that was pretty cool and I remember

1046
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:10,280
enjoying cense star I remember it being

1047
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:13,480
uh solid High you

1048
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:16,119
know having that really

1049
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:21,000
light

1050
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:24,079
sugary sweetness you know yeah I like

1051
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,400
the sweet cannabis tones in general I

1052
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,798
don't know what Turk profiles those are

1053
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,798
any of that [ __ ] but you know what I'm

1054
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:34,318
talking

1055
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:36,400
about sweet and I thought it matched up

1056
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:39,519
pretty good with the description in

1057
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,680
the yeah yeah yeah that was actually by

1058
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:45,119
the time it got released uh and made it

1059
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:47,318
over here in uh Luke had released it in

1060
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,480
SE in fem seed form it was pretty

1061
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:52,318
uniform too even from the even from the

1062
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,199
seed pack so the the kind of centy star

1063
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:55,719
they had on the East Coast would match

1064
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:59,078
up a lot with what was going on on the

1065
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:01,279
West Coast very very uh

1066
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,599
consistent here's a good one for you I

1067
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,880
know you can wax poetic about the

1068
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,920
Shram I liked the Sham man I really did

1069
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,720
you know I got excited when a friend of

1070
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:15,280
mine got that cut back recently and I

1071
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:18,318
started thinking about potential seed

1072
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,040
making projects immediately just got

1073
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:25,400
excited and uh that excitement tempered

1074
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:28,880
a little bit

1075
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:32,318
um as as far as the seed making goes

1076
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,760
yeah because when I think Colombian I

1077
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:35,759
believe that's

1078
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,400
Colombian Colombian

1079
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,440
Romulan Colombian Romulan yeah the

1080
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,519
little bit of experience I have with

1081
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,920
different Colombian genetics man you

1082
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,880
never know what you're gonna get right

1083
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,200
with

1084
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,480
yeah and I realize that's there's

1085
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:56,159
nothing scientific about that conclusion

1086
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,318
but in my decision making process that's

1087
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:03,239
concl iion I use um but as far as

1088
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:07,199
smoking I really liked it that

1089
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:10,279
was that's the and I know it's it's an

1090
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:14,639
old stereotype that string but that is

1091
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,920
the most nag Champa insense like string

1092
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,480
yeah that the way it smells while it's

1093
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,760
growing that's what it smells like

1094
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,719
smells like that when you smoking it and

1095
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,680
smells like that in room after you're

1096
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,759
done sming you know and just the the

1097
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,598
person still have it that you were

1098
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,160
talking to they still rocking it I don't

1099
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:36,079
know if theyve flowered it yet but

1100
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:39,399
supposedly they have it that'd be cool

1101
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:42,400
that'd be cool to see my DMs to remind

1102
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:45,000
myself of which person that was yeah I

1103
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,960
hate when that [ __ ] happens bro hate

1104
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,719
it yeah oh I know who it was yeah um I'm

1105
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,760
sure they'll give it a good run and test

1106
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:56,519
and I don't think it's on of lock down

1107
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,839
or anything yeah I doubt it because it's

1108
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:00,639
so few people know what it is to even

1109
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:06,078
know to want it

1110
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:06,078
anymore well actually I remember

1111
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:14,400
shy picking people when he released that

1112
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:16,920
c but uh it got passed around number of

1113
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,400
people first time I grew it I actually

1114
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,000
killed it off at like day 25 I was like

1115
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,240
look I'm just G start again because I

1116
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,440
did not plan I had never grown a plant

1117
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:31,558
stretch like that yeah don't never have

1118
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:34,480
Dr a plant that that stretches that much

1119
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:37,400
yeah and I was in a closet at the time I

1120
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,559
didn't even have a tent other than a

1121
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:44,358
yeah and she just she took off I mean

1122
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:46,760
Beyond even tying over the space between

1123
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:48,400
I'm like okay I know what I did wrong I

1124
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,960
mean I flowered her at like two feet

1125
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:57,280
tall in closet yeah was s feet tall in I

1126
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:00,400
bet three weeks yeah

1127
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,640
um but yeah I grew her for a while

1128
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,798
uh the bud structure always annoyed me a

1129
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:11,078
little bit you know it was not a was not

1130
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:13,559
a yielder Weight Wise you have a plant d

1131
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:19,079
That's I finally got it put out and it's

1132
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:23,359
like jeez but since I have

1133
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:27,400
acquired uh a taste for for dry sift

1134
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:29,639
hash and making my own hash yeah that

1135
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,838
that's what I'm really excited to do I

1136
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:35,879
can only imagine how good that

1137
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:38,199
has and we'll see we'll see if the

1138
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,280
flowers earn and sit I'm definitely get

1139
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:43,879
my hands on so real quick like kind of

1140
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,400
as an aside when you talk about dry sift

1141
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,838
hash do you would you prefer the profile

1142
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,200
of the resin to be more greasy or more

1143
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:53,159
like Sandy for doing dryi

1144
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,838
hash

1145
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:58,000
100% not because of the quality of hash

1146
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:02,119
just for the sake of keeping your

1147
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,880
screens [ __ ] clean man yeah

1148
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:08,920
difference when you're when you're dry

1149
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:11,599
siy yeah uh I've got some strains that

1150
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:14,079
uh that I've sifted a few times it's

1151
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,480
like man I just I don't want to try this

1152
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:20,318
[ __ ] anymore the hash is amazing yeah

1153
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:25,000
it's actually it's actually

1154
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:28,279
uh trop cherries by Relentless yeah yeah

1155
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,079
you know you don't expect the resins to

1156
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:34,319
be that gooey because of the way they

1157
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:37,359
grow on the plant yeah the way they even

1158
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,759
look on the flowers and and the leaf

1159
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:43,519
material uh but they are gooey when they

1160
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:49,440
go through that screen man uh but the

1161
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:52,199
hash is from that St is is awesome oh I

1162
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,400
bet I know it's a big hit because of

1163
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:58,318
that people love that chop Cherry hash

1164
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,358
well I just I I was reading uh Fletcher

1165
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:03,358
argued with somebody about how Tropicana

1166
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:07,279
cherries was just

1167
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:10,119
a a lower remake of the

1168
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,079
Tang hit

1169
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:14,160
with I don't even remember what the

1170
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,000
argument was about but I thought he was

1171
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:19,399
short

1172
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,559
drifting Tropicana cherries a little bit

1173
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:25,960
yeah I mean it it it I've always

1174
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,480
wondered how you get cherry on top of

1175
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,639
Orange because orange is usually so

1176
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:34,798
dominant I mean it's a hard pick well

1177
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:37,159
the the cut that that I have now uh I

1178
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:39,880
haven't grown it yet but I've seen it

1179
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:42,798
being grown yeah for the three and a

1180
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:45,640
half years by my buddy here so I've been

1181
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:49,679
making half that

1182
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:53,558
leaf um it's more orange than than it is

1183
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:56,960
Cherry is it okay that makes

1184
00:56:53,559 --> 00:57:00,798
sense but in the hash

1185
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,559
once you sift it like it's almost

1186
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:08,199
like it's almost like the orange turs

1187
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:12,720
don't make final screen for the

1188
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:15,439
hash but Cherry do and it comes out very

1189
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:18,279
much smelling like Cherry pip

1190
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,400
toac is it is it a cherry pie cross the

1191
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,960
drop

1192
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:27,119
cherries I don't think so it doesn't it

1193
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,119
doesn't seem like uh

1194
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:31,480
it doesn't seem like cherry pie to me at

1195
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,000
all I actually like cherry pie I ran

1196
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:39,480
that for for a little yeah I did

1197
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:43,679
too um it's a little closer to didn't

1198
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:47,920
uh didn't CSI do a cherry pie Tim D

1199
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:50,639
cross I'm sure did yeah that would be a

1200
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,358
nice combination oh yeah yeah dude I

1201
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:56,519
like I've always liked cherry pie quite

1202
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:59,119
a bit so I guess trop trop cherries is I

1203
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:02,318
just looked at Relentless as site it's

1204
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:05,760
the Tropicana cookies which was uh I

1205
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:07,639
don't know Tangi cookies crossed with

1206
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,640
cherry cookies F3 which I don't know

1207
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:12,199
much about their their cherry cookies or

1208
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,318
what made the cherry or whatever but it

1209
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,480
it's a gorgeous cut it's a gorgeous cut

1210
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,880
I like Relentless a lot too really cool

1211
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,798
dudes yeah I've been rooting for him any

1212
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,160
of the guys that came up on the forums

1213
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:25,358
you know

1214
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:28,679
got or even we're we already in their

1215
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,679
early years when they were

1216
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:34,480
on they tend to have a different

1217
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,440
attitude too like I don't know why I've

1218
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,119
always gotten along with him real well

1219
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,720
and it just uh it's one of those things

1220
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,200
where you know kind of get where each

1221
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:43,519
other came from what kind of [ __ ]

1222
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:46,960
what kind of [ __ ] each other put up

1223
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:50,280
with to get here well in fishstick Uncle

1224
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:54,199
fishstick from the forums he's he's here

1225
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:58,599
uh he also has a cherry cookies cut that

1226
00:58:54,199 --> 00:59:02,038
is actually that is a pretty insane cut

1227
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:04,359
like that was when when he started

1228
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:05,920
growing that I got some of that that was

1229
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:08,598
the first time I've

1230
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,720
been here in Las crues and found

1231
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:14,960
something that I mean oops I smoked a

1232
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:17,358
little too much that time yeah kind of

1233
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,679
surprise you know it took me off guard

1234
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:23,279
I've had had a number of cookies crosses

1235
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:26,919
that I like smoking you know

1236
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,119
sure but that one he's also got a got of

1237
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:33,880
what's the kimd isn't

1238
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:36,798
uh what's the kimd GMO is that K yeah

1239
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,440
yeah yeah it's like a yeah it's a camd I

1240
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:40,838
don't know if it's uh Forum or camd or

1241
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,880
some kind of cookie

1242
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:46,838
camd yeah it's uh speaking of New Mexico

1243
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,480
drying and curing you know that stuff

1244
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:52,759
I've got sample of and it's about three

1245
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,079
weeks of curing now and it I mean it

1246
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,520
just takes yeah dude you could tell

1247
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:59,960
there's KD in it just when you smell

1248
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:03,239
it what's that you could tell there's

1249
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:06,280
camd in it just when you smell it like

1250
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:09,239
instantly I it's I kind of milked that

1251
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,079
that jar a little bit you know yeah it's

1252
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:16,719
it's

1253
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:20,160
good but the the 92 OG potency wise uh

1254
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:22,679
it punches the GMO in the face oh

1255
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,598
interesting yeah I mean it's uh it's one

1256
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:27,598
of those it's one of those OG cuts that

1257
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:31,559
I'm not sure I would want that to be my

1258
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:35,200
permanent OG cut yeah because it's a

1259
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:38,760
heavy hit High yeah like I I smoke last

1260
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:42,279
of that GMO now instead of 92 OG before

1261
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,160
this show because I'm still like ready

1262
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,640
to fall out here you

1263
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:49,639
know oh speaking of OG did you ever get

1264
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:53,239
to try the Tokyo OG when you're in San

1265
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:56,480
Diego no I remember that dispensary

1266
01:00:53,239 --> 01:01:00,879
Point LMA people talking about the Toyo

1267
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:05,639
OG yeah at first there was the usual you

1268
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:08,760
know bitching and moan in to rename

1269
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:13,598
this um and that happened with every

1270
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:16,559
single OG that popped up sure you know

1271
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:20,880
yeah but it was around for a while I

1272
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:26,559
mean [ __ ] fire it was [ __ ] fire

1273
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:29,920
yeah who know OG kush yeah who were big

1274
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:31,920
on that on the Tokyo OG the first time I

1275
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,960
smoked it I couldn't drive home bro I

1276
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,240
couldn't drive home I had to give

1277
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,358
someone my keys and that's when I was

1278
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:39,159
like [ __ ] this is strong you know like I

1279
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:42,358
I figured any other [ __ ] OG but it

1280
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:47,038
was strong like something else to

1281
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:50,000
it the variety that has come from the

1282
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:53,920
what I assume are all S1 seeds or not

1283
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:58,639
all but for the most part yeah bag seeds

1284
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:02,000
I mean just the quality I've got okay so

1285
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:04,400
resin lung in addition to that cut he

1286
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,798
gave me two big vials of seeds it's got

1287
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,480
to be I don't

1288
01:02:05,798 --> 01:02:13,599
know thousand OG seeds that were just

1289
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:16,000
taken out his crew was moving

1290
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:19,079
yeah and they were just selected he's

1291
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,278
even got the two guys name on the bottle

1292
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:24,278
Oh Yeah from I think

1293
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:31,038
oh I I think it's stated 04 through 08

1294
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:33,239
yeah so it's a bunch of bag seats from

1295
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,559
the big you know because they didn't

1296

1299
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:47,119
ones oh brutal yeah yeah I you know I

1300
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,720
always just occasionally get it it'll

1301
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:51,160
come back to bite me though because you

1302
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:54,038
know I like to pop five at a time in my

1303
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:57,239
current setup yeah

1304
01:02:54,039 --> 01:03:00,278
five uh and I'll drop those in now like

1305
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:01,399
30 or 40 of them one day you're going to

1306
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:05,278
get

1307
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,960
40 day I'm G to get like 85% germination

1308
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:11,400
and how could you let any of that [ __ ]

1309
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:14,358
go you know you couldn't absolutely

1310
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:18,039
couldn't I've got a bunch of old scenes

1311
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:22,239
that I want to pop right now the problem

1312
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:24,680
is having having room having room and

1313
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:26,479
viability I mean I like I told you the

1314
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:28,399
story about uh great scho sent me the

1315
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,199
last of the bull rider seeds that he had

1316
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,079
I think they were from gerbo one of the

1317
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:36,118
guys and um I had a person that I

1318
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,599
thought was going to be able to to crack

1319
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:42,039
them by a tissue culture and that dude

1320
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:43,640
ended up being not able to do it and so

1321
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:45,200
I sent him back to gry skull and I don't

1322
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:47,078
know if he ever found anyone for it but

1323
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:50,278
those would be worth it to to try to

1324
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:52,000
crack you know let me some of those I

1325
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:55,119
don't know if it was at the same top or

1326
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,639
maybe it was ones you sent back to him

1327
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,039
I'm not sure

1328
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:01,278
I had zero luck I even tried the seed

1329
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,520
cracker on a couple of

1330
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:05,679
them uh I tried putting some and

1331
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:08,639
straight

1332
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:11,318
dirt uh and made sure that you know they

1333
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:13,440
didn't get I mean like three times a day

1334
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:16,519
just making sure it wasn't packed too

1335
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,960
hard above the seeds

1336
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:22,759
yeah yeah you know I always wondered if

1337
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,119
old Betsy was selfed if you could go

1338
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,200
through that population and find

1339
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:29,160
something more similar to bull riter

1340
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:31,358
than old Betsy itself if they're truly

1341
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:35,358
related and you got to check out those

1342
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:40,000
pictures Sean gr has a

1343
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:44,519
new oh I haven't seen him look to it

1344
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,278
it's very similar to bull rider you you

1345
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:49,838
could tell just by looking at the buds

1346
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:52,519
between bull rider and Afghan bull rider

1347
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:55,318
you you pick each one of them out

1348
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:59,559
immediately and uh from what I've seen

1349
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:02,798
of the live plants Sean posted uh it

1350
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:05,278
it's definitely a full Rider leaner

1351
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:09,358
interesting I don't even know if he's

1352
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:11,920
smoked I don't know if he's finished

1353
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:14,440
harvesting I'll hit him up yeah hit him

1354
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,440
up and find out I'm

1355
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:20,278
interested all right Super Silver Haze I

1356
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,720
know we covered some of this about um

1357
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:24,559
where the cut came from the uh the

1358
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:27,598
different nomenclature of it whether it

1359
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,880
was the 98 Cup winning cut uh whether it

1360
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,838
wasn't can you talk a little bit about

1361
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,640
what you've seen in the breeding that

1362
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:37,519
you've done with

1363
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:39,920
it you know I went back because number

1364
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:43,838
of people hit me up about it after last

1365
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:47,960
show yeah but we did and I went back and

1366
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:49,838
looked on my Instagram and my where

1367
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:53,400
where I was posting about it as I was

1368
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:56,159
growing it as I was curing it

1369
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:59,760
and there's there's more

1370
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,598
info in those five or six posts than

1371
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,240
than what I even went over on the show

1372
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:09,039
last time yeah comes up you look at six

1373
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:11,358
of my last seven flower posts have been

1374
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,240
uh three different types of plant that

1375
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:15,318
I've

1376
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:17,639
seen that a number of people have seen

1377
01:06:15,318 --> 01:06:20,838
you know come from those and the one

1378
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:23,519
thing came up I noticed a lot was lining

1379
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:26,278
I forgot how liny those things were

1380
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:29,358
especially one in particular

1381
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:34,239
last um on my Instagram I described it

1382
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:37,078
as limey or limey Jack herrer okay yeah

1383
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,838
it really reminded me Jack Herrera is

1384
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:40,519
actually one of I think when we were

1385
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:43,480
talking about Cy star I mentioned

1386
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:45,719
getting a strain from the dispensary and

1387
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,838
trusting that that was it Jack Herrera

1388
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:53,639
was one of the first ones I got and I

1389
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:56,038
love I for Jack rcut as much as I

1390
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:59,879
enjoyed that first

1391
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:01,520
uh Jack experience that I had from the

1392
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,960
dispensary

1393
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:08,159
um and the primary difference between

1394
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:13,318
the classic Jack rare and the SSH to

1395
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:15,719
me uh was the flavor it was a little

1396
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:18,759
more uh with the

1397
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:21,358
SSH uh and that comes across uh in that

1398
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:24,760
last run I did a three different plants

1399
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:26,519
one I described as lyine one was lemony

1400
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,240
and then one was was the weirdo which

1401
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:30,480
was just pissed off and looked unhappy

1402
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:36,000
the whole

1403
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:41,039
time uh you could tell you can tell that

1404
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,480
the one of the two hazes in SSH yeah

1405
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,359
through in

1406
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:50,240
seeds uh I described it last time as

1407
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:55,519
'90s Seed Catalog stock photo of a '90s

1408
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:57,239
a hybrid yeah uh it was very typical

1409
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:00,759
pictures from back then I guess that was

1410
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:04,038
actually the the the 2000s really no

1411
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:07,680
that was the '90s too

1412
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:10,880
um but she's very dominant in the one

1413
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:13,440
cross I've made yeah I mean if if you

1414
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,278
like SS you'll like everything that

1415
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,319
comes from this

1416
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:21,238
plan uh from this

1417
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:25,080
cross uh and that's the one we have

1418
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:26,198
labeled uh sssdh on the uh on site on

1419
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:30,559
riot

1420
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:33,559
right yeah it's uh it's definitely the

1421
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,679
non Haz leaners the Haz leaners are

1422
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,960
obvious from what I've been told from

1423
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,039
the other Growers who have grown it what

1424
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:44,079
I've seen pictures of what I've grown

1425
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:46,158
here myself yeah no doubt uh number one

1426
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:49,479
they don't like small containers for

1427
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:54,798
their Reas they a bigger container the

1428
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:58,079
SSH is the SSH leaners are very much uh

1429
01:08:54,798 --> 01:09:00,719
classic indoor grow you can grow this

1430
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:04,640
much from this much almost

1431
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:06,560
Hydro properties when it comes to the pl

1432
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,440
you're going to get I grew them in three

1433
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:12,039
gallon containers they were you know

1434
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:16,000
four feet tall

1435
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:17,960
yeah big yielders as you would expect

1436
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,279
because that's pure SSH right there

1437
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,880
that's

1438
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:26,560
absolutely um but The Hazing fenos which

1439
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,319
I really got a kick out

1440
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,000
uh they want the

1441
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:36,039
bigger the bigger pots I'll let you

1442
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:41,198
know comes through in the high uh much

1443
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:43,640
more body in the SSH leaners yeah than I

1444
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:46,479
mean they have the same look when you

1445
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:48,880
look at the SSH mom you don't think pure

1446
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:51,158
sativa by any stretch in the

1447
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:55,920
imagination uh because it's just too

1448
01:09:51,158 --> 01:09:58,839
good of a the buds are thick and yeah

1449
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,279
branches are fully loaded

1450
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:05,719
uh but from The Taste and the smell you

1451
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:08,920
definitely get the sativa impression

1452
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:10,960
yeah uh but own you it'll it'll kick you

1453
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,239
it'll kick you in the stomach you know

1454
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,239
it's

1455
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:18,399
yeah sounds like an ideal the ideal

1456
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:21,198
hybrid using uh Super Silver Haze and

1457
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:23,639
the sour dub you know you get lucky in

1458
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,319
that way like I said on the first show

1459
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,039
pretty much the only thing I said on the

1460
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,799
the first show was it wasn't what I was

1461
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:33,880
looking for and that's just because it

1462
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:39,480
doesn't resemble anything to do with

1463
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:40,960
sour double except a sweetness uh a

1464
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:42,799
tightness

1465
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,679
in

1466
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:49,600
heightening and improving the sweetness

1467
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:53,239
of SSH because the S has that cedar over

1468
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,880
bite you know yeah uh little bit

1469
01:10:53,238 --> 01:10:57,039
accurate but the sour double smooth out

1470
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,159
makes it a little

1471
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:04,399
sweeter and it gives it a better

1472
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:07,960
high or at least more balanced everybody

1473
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:10,679
loved that sshi you know that hike right

1474
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:12,520
between indicia and sativa for me it

1475
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:15,480
just wasn't potent enough you know I

1476
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:18,320
think I used of how many how much we had

1477
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:21,000
to smoke to get through a Raiders

1478
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:23,559
game you had to smoke a lot you know

1479
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,920
yeah um that was the only downside but

1480
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,920
it tastes so good that

1481
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:31,920
you know like sour double or east coast

1482
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:34,039
Sour Diesel you just keep smoking yeah I

1483
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,800
can imagine that lip smacking translate

1484
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:39,238
like how with the sour translating on on

1485
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,840
top of that uh SSH would be really

1486
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:45,238
freaking nice yeah and that's not to say

1487
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:50,400
that won't pop up I got a 50 seed grow

1488
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:52,399
going with krd yeah out where Long Beach

1489
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,839
wherever out there in Southern

1490
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:58,839
California and maybe he will find more

1491
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,480
of that sour influence yeah but it's

1492
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:03,000
definitely

1493
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:05,599
something if I were to describe it I

1494
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,119
would say you're going to get the SSH

1495
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,120
experience you're gonna

1496
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:13,079
get you know a lot of the younger

1497
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:14,639
generation are not as hip to the SSH and

1498
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:16,760
I'm sure a lot are interested in it so

1499
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:18,400
it's a great place for them to start you

1500
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,480
know as opposed to trying to hunt

1501
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:23,439
through you know the 30 seeds of [ __ ]

1502
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:26,559
Super Silver Haze to try to find one

1503
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:28,799
keeper you know and if you're new you

1504
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,199
know if you're new to smoking if you

1505
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,480
came around after the sshs and the

1506
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:35,599
Neville's

1507
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:39,198
Haze this is a good plant because it's

1508
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:42,400
got all the potency that any of the yeah

1509
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:45,839
any new fangled stuff has I mean it's an

1510
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:49,399
ass kicker for sure um so you're not

1511
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,119
going to a pure SSH experience at all

1512
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:54,238
you're going to you're still going to

1513
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:56,639
get all the body that you need how long

1514
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:59,638
is a flowering on average do you think

1515
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:02,639
uh people going to find there all the

1516
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:05,800
SSH leaners I've flowered I flowered for

1517
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:08,039
6870 days

1518
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:13,079
yeah uh the Haz

1519
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:16,399
laners uh I took mine to 85 this last

1520
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:20,639
time and it probably could another week

1521
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,599
yeah but it was it was sadiva you know

1522
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:25,239
it was

1523
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,600
ha um it had one of the interesting

1524
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:30,559
things about that plant that I forgotten

1525
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:33,760
about was when I had it I had it in the

1526
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:36,280
tub you know finishing up drying burping

1527
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:41,760
and when I would open it the the aroma

1528
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:45,119
was movie theater popcorn butter oh wow

1529
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:47,679
I did not expect at all uh but when you

1530
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,039
up an individual flower and held it to

1531
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:53,239
your nose give it a little squeeze it

1532
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:55,960
was it was like Sweet Tarts it was super

1533
01:13:53,238 --> 01:13:58,759
sharp oh wow

1534
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:02,600
it's one of the weirdest is that a

1535
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:06,880
dichotomy yeah yeah weirdest situations

1536
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:10,679
and and post cure it lost the the movie

1537
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:13,639
theater butter popcorn smell it just

1538
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:16,719
sweetness but didn't taste like SSH at

1539
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:19,119
all didn't look like SSH it looked like

1540
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:22,079
a very dense

1541
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:24,920
small uh

1542
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,679
Haze a lot of different Haze hybrids out

1543
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:30,079
there

1544
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:33,719
a lot of range in that term yeah and

1545
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:37,238
these smaller flowers that were

1546
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:41,719
everywhere yielded huge I smoked that

1547
01:14:37,238 --> 01:14:44,479
cut and I cut alone for almost six

1548
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:47,198
months I really went full on that was my

1549
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:50,158
first real experience with the

1550
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:54,638
sativa even though it's not a pure

1551
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:57,759
sativa genetic by by breeding by lineage

1552
01:14:54,639 --> 01:14:59,960
it was was it was it was Haze man and it

1553
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,719
was my first real experience with that

1554
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,399
yeah I remember talking to you during it

1555
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:04,920
and how you're how you're opinion

1556
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:07,719
changed over time like you know I kind

1557
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:10,480
of like this [ __ ] [ __ ] you know yeah

1558
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:13,119
yeah I did a complete 180

1559
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:18,279
uh over the course of a year you know

1560
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:21,119
some yeah some work hash um and again

1561
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:23,840
cure is nothing new to any of us but

1562
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,880
it's still something that can amaze me

1563
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,960
to this day

1564
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:31,679
absolutely not care matter of fact I

1565
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,679
still got some of that it's dry as hell

1566
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,399
but I still have some of that you know

1567
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:39,560
when when people talk about making live

1568
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:42,920
resin hash and

1569
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:45,400
like doing that without curing the plant

1570
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:48,480
how does that how does that hit you like

1571
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:51,399
does that sound advisable would you be

1572
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:55,559
something like that you're hashing for

1573
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:57,439
tping is that all it is I mean

1574
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,719
when they advertise it that that's I

1575
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:01,759
mean the high no way is the high going

1576
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:05,119
to be better

1577
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:09,039
yeah if I have the term correct any live

1578
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:11,880
resin live rosin any live resin hashish

1579
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:13,679
that just means they cut the plant down

1580
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:17,639
trimmed it and threw it in the freezer

1581
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:20,199
right and then hashed yeah um I mean I'm

1582
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:22,119
not dogging it hell dude [ __ ] rosin

1583
01:16:20,198 --> 01:16:23,319
changed a whole lot the first time I

1584
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:26,439
ever

1585
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:28,759
smoked um but yeah no it's not going to

1586
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:31,879
have the same properties there are so

1587
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,560
many chemical processes that we still

1588
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,760
that scientists still have not looked

1589
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:38,639
into yeah

1590
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:42,119
within uh not to mention what happens

1591
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:43,800
when you completely compress and mix

1592
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:46,960
those those

1593
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:50,239
chemicals and then let them form into

1594
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:54,520
into a third chemical compound you know

1595
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:58,079
there's left but I don't personally

1596
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:00,639
there is no concentrate that I don't

1597
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:03,079
like you

1598
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:05,880
know problem

1599
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:09,079
yeah but to me the

1600
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:13,520
solventless uh

1601
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:15,880
cured hashish is just my personal

1602
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,360
favorite uh I remember the first time

1603
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:22,000
keeping track of curing the flowers that

1604
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:24,319
I harvested and doing it and burping it

1605
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,399
in the beginning having them in glass

1606
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:28,319
jars

1607
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:29,839
the first few times I mean it it it

1608
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,238
really blows your mind the first time

1609
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:35,440
you do it yeah and some are more

1610
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:38,359
dependent on it than others rev Cindy 99

1611
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:41,479
is probably the most cure dependent

1612
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:44,279
strain I've ever seen because what goes

1613
01:17:41,479 --> 01:17:45,919
into those jars after harvest is so

1614
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:49,158
heavy smelling it almost makes me

1615
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:55,039
nauseous yeah what come four six weeks

1616
01:17:49,158 --> 01:17:57,719
later is that sweet light Airy that you

1617
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:03,359
expect from a city 99

1618
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:05,920
yeah um so yeah so I'm a big fan of

1619
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:10,519
curing before

1620
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:12,600
making hash she concentrates any of that

1621
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:17,000
but again you're talking about cannabis

1622
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,000
concentrates so it's still Gonna Get You

1623
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:22,520
Higher six months yeah I was just I was

1624
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:25,238
thinking about that because people are

1625
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,639
asking me about doing uh concentrates

1626
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:30,198
with my blueberry and realistically

1627
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:32,440
blueberry the type that we've made and

1628
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:34,559
worked on it takes a good month for it

1629
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:37,678
to fully form back in because once you

1630
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,560
chop it down a lot of that that super

1631
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:43,560
Berry smell dissipates and as you cure

1632
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,880
it it comes back full force like tenfold

1633
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,480
but people were talking about making

1634
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,199
live rosin with it I was just like I

1635
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:50,519
don't I don't know how that's going to

1636
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:54,158
do any fa you know favors for you if

1637
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:55,840
you're chasing blueberry you know well

1638
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:57,479
again that's what we say it's strain

1639
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:02,239
dependent you know I would say that

1640
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:06,439
there's plants that smell that the way

1641
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:09,439
they smell at the end of harvest M

1642
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:11,479
preferable in some you know fine points

1643
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:14,198
here and there to the cured smell you

1644
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:17,638
know there there's some out there when I

1645
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:19,879
say they're they're pressing for turs I

1646
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:22,800
mean that's what I assume because I've

1647
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:26,199
never heard the argument that fresh

1648
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:29,279
resin is or Bo

1649
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:32,519
yeah you know what I mean so I'm

1650
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,359
assuming that when they do the live

1651
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,320
they're

1652
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:38,000
doing particular strength yeah I

1653
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:39,158
remember strawberry cream was that way

1654
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,560
that was that was another one where it

1655
01:19:39,158 --> 01:19:44,319
was like instantly the way it smelled at

1656
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,360
cure or right at dry was super

1657
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:48,679
strawberry you really didn't get much

1658
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:49,920
more strawberry as it cured so it

1659
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:52,000
probably would be good for something

1660
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,840
like that in that sense but I don't know

1661
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,560
how the high would translate for sure no

1662
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:00,239
and when you're pressing meaning what I

1663
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:03,280
assume to be heat you know

1664
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:06,000
rosin you're getting all the tpes that

1665
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:10,519
are on that plant at the time

1666
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,600
of um when you do dry shift for example

1667
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:15,480
or bubble hash my two favorite ways of

1668
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,000
of

1669
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:22,039
hashing uh you've got different size

1670
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,279
screens so in a lot of cases like bubble

1671
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:26,079
people who make bubble hash they keep a

1672
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:29,559
lot of different grades they keep

1673
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:33,319
anywhere from two to five grades for

1674
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:35,920
different reasons yeah reasons are

1675
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:37,679
they're all different you know you can

1676
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,800
go within the sizes that made it through

1677
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:45,079
each screen and you can

1678
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:47,279
assume uh especially as you as you get

1679
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:52,719
smaller that everything going through

1680
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:55,479
that screen is one kind of triome or

1681
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:58,000
triome stock or

1682
01:20:55,479 --> 01:21:02,399
some plants have different size tricomes

1683
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,198
you know so when you when I do dryft the

1684
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,238
the trop cherries is a good example if

1685
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:07,678
you get that as flour you're gonna

1686
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:10,238
you're going to be hit with that that

1687
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:13,880
Citrus orange smell right off the bat

1688
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:19,039
yeah uh flour but for whatever reason I

1689
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:22,840
only keep hash that's been worked on 220

1690
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:26,880
lines per inch whatever's left top of

1691
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:30,000
the 220 LPI which is 75 microns

1692
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:33,840
approximately whatever's left on top of

1693
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,880
that 220 LPI screen that's what my hash

1694
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,000
is I don't even keep any of the other

1695
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:39,319
ones doesn't mean they're not good

1696
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,399
doesn't mean they're not potent it's

1697
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:43,158
just

1698
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:47,158
that's that's the hashes everything else

1699
01:21:43,158 --> 01:21:50,158
is something that great um so when I

1700
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:51,839
scream the Tropic can of cherries

1701
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:55,799
wherever those

1702
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:58,119
whatever those orange chirping are at

1703
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:01,480
wherever they're kept at it doesn't make

1704
01:21:58,119 --> 01:22:03,559
my 220 screen it's either the the the

1705
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:06,799
pile below it or the pile that was left

1706
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:10,960
on top of the 110 that I used to get

1707
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:14,119
220 that's so carry pipe tobacco smell

1708
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,679
and no Citrus at all I never even

1709
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:18,238
realized or came to the conclusion that

1710
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:20,880
it could do that but that makes total

1711
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:23,839
sense as you explain it that's kind of

1712
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:26,639
stream of Consciousness overall because

1713
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,000
I'm still learnning how it's going but

1714
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:32,400
that's that's a really good example so

1715
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:36,479
for example the the blueberry nine yeah

1716
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:39,279
the blueberry nine yeah might come out

1717
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:41,959
uh extremely blueberry either at time of

1718
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:44,158
harvest or a month down the road or

1719
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,359
maintain it the whole time that doesn't

1720
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:49,198
mean that blueberry turpine will make it

1721
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:53,479
into into the hatch yeah that's

1722
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:55,359
correct uh it all depends yeah that

1723
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:57,919
makes sense dude yeah I never thought

1724
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:00,960
about it that way well the second oldest

1725
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,719
form of cannabis behind growing the

1726
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:07,639
plant itself uh is still the most

1727
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:11,679
unexplained and that's you know dry SI

1728
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:13,159
hases yeah it's still unexplained form

1729
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,239
unexplored

1730
01:23:13,158 --> 01:23:17,198
scientifically form

1731
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:20,839
of

1732
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:22,439
yeah well we're about an hour and 20 in

1733
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,760
so I think uh let's see is there

1734
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:26,519
anything else we wanted to get in in

1735
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:29,960
this episode cuz we're going to do some

1736
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:33,639
more uh the San Diego's Cuts I don't

1737
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:36,158
know that we ever talked about J1 no no

1738
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:36,159
let's hit up

1739
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,079
J1 what's

1740
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:47,639
that no we haven't touched on J1

1741
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:51,238
yet you back there I had a phone call

1742
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:53,920
coming in oh there you go you're

1743
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,799
here I had a phone call coming in sorry

1744
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,800
about that you're

1745
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:00,480
good

1746
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,360
so so we didn't we didn't touch on that

1747
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:07,319
last

1748
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:09,158
time that was a wicked strain uh for for

1749
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:10,000
bag appeal it's one of the best I've

1750
01:24:09,158 --> 01:24:13,559
ever

1751
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:17,880
seen uh to our knowledge it's uh Jack

1752
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:19,639
rare skunk number one yeah was brought

1753
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:23,600
back from

1754
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:28,520
Amsterdam what my source thinks is the

1755
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:30,960
the the 90 % solid story of it

1756
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,679
yeah he brought it he gave it to me it

1757
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,520
was interesting because the forums were

1758
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:36,440
getting

1759
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,840
going and me and this guy had already

1760
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:42,399
been in touch he's a friend of he was a

1761
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:46,639
friend of reps he's passed on now yeah

1762
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:49,279
mountain or no from uh the Cabana or

1763
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:54,520
skunk magazine

1764
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:58,479
okay um Oldtimer buddies with rev he hit

1765
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:01,520
me up he was one who got me all of revs

1766
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:05,238
seeds uh pollen from his breeders

1767
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:08,480
program yeah he was the intermediary

1768
01:25:05,238 --> 01:25:11,479
between me and the r

1769
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:13,198
um he had this cut the forums were

1770
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:18,279
getting going and he had an interesting

1771
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:21,719
idea he wanted to bring J1 he was up in

1772
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:25,399
Shasta he brought it down to San Diego

1773
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:28,000
and he wanted to see online how fast it

1774
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:30,039
would take for that cut to spread yeah

1775
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,920
just just because the internet was new

1776
01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:34,679
to us old times you know what I mean

1777
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:37,000
yeah like we already had the cuts thread

1778
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:41,719
going I already had seeds thread going

1779
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,520
let just see what so we gave it to G uh

1780
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:46,679
I think he was working with Shan at the

1781
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,360
time I think yeah I

1782
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:51,520
think

1783
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:53,599
um and he gave it out and we gave him

1784
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,800
lots of cuts that he grew into a number

1785
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,560
of mothers so it spread fast and you

1786
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,239
literally could watch it in the forums

1787
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,039
as it made its way back up north and

1788
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:06,718
within the first two months there are

1789
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:10,840
already two [ __ ] origin stories out

1790
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:15,439
there people play yeah you but it was it

1791
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:18,600
grew so Jack herrer like yeah

1792
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:20,799
uh but even more coated with resin than

1793
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,800
the best pictures of Jack rare they ever

1794
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:27,119
showed I mean it was just C uh it

1795
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:31,079

1796
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:34,158
like wow expressed as yellow Gatorade

1797
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:36,960
yeah but the potency Factor wasn't

1798
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:39,158
really keeping up with everything else

1799
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,679
that was around I mean it's a nice it

1800
01:26:39,158 --> 01:26:44,479
was a nice daytime smoke but it uh it

1801
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:47,158
went through the circles down there in

1802
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:48,959
San Diego pretty quick

1803

1841
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:55,479
area of the country it was just some of

1842

C I got lucky um I got I got his uh

1846
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,079
metal Haze cut early on like the actual

1847

cut cut and was able to grow it it was

1848
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:17,519
it was definitely cool uh made a lot of

1849
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:19,799
crosses with it early on rev rev he's uh

1850
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,920
A Relic from the past and not enough of

1851
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:25,159
the the younger dudes know about him but

1852
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:28,719
he's very influential yeah on Instagram

1853
01:29:25,158 --> 01:29:31,439
because eight got some uh red is it

1854
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:35,198
Russian River skunk or red red red

1855
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:37,479
Russian skunk red Russian skunk yeah

1856
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:41,158
picked up a pack of those and I was like

1857
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:44,079
I I don't understand why this guy has

1858
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:49,319
never had his time

1859
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:51,559
in in the you know online world you know

1860
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:55,719
there's all over the world who know who

1861
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:57,400
he is with his soil and his genetics but

1862
01:29:55,719 --> 01:29:59,639
I don't understand everybody's always

1863
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:03,000
bitching I want something that's

1864
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:06,118
different yeah right using the same [ __ ]

1865
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,439
well hit up Kingdom organic seeds

1866
01:30:06,118 --> 01:30:11,118
because it's all different there every

1867
01:30:08,439 --> 01:30:13,479
bit of it I think it's because he never

1868
01:30:11,118 --> 01:30:15,198
dipped into OG Kush he never dipped into

1869
01:30:13,479 --> 01:30:17,439
any hype strains and crossed him into

1870
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:19,960
his stuff so there was like no little

1871
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:21,599
middle ground for like people that

1872
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,760
wanted OG but wanted to try something

1873
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,480
different with OG like they just never

1874
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,280
got introduced to him that way you had

1875
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:29,279
to be from a certain era to really get

1876
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,319
what he was doing and why he was doing

1877
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:36,118
it the way he was doing it he say he has

1878
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:39,399
killer [ __ ] at 70s and 80s

1879
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:42,839
weed he used Madness in the cross that's

1880
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:45,960
right that's right but Madness was not

1881
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:49,400
like the others Madness was you know an

1882
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:50,439
Oregon big bud cross it was from the era

1883
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:52,359
before

1884
01:30:50,439 --> 01:30:55,198
p91

1885
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:58,719
yeah and all that which is probably why

1886
01:30:55,198 --> 01:31:02,599
he liked it yeah it would make sense

1887
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,600
yeah shout out rev he deserves

1936
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:25,880
post is so what's this I he

1937
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:29,960
about

1938
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:34,359
double half the plant is [ __ ] and the

1939
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:36,560
other half is perfectly fine yeah it so

1940
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:40,559
ridiculous and stupid at the

1941
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:42,600
time um and and I'm still as far as I

1942
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:45,880
got we're like just starting to work our

1943
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:49,159
way through the through the confusion

1944
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:52,800
and TMV came back up right away you know

1945
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:55,719
of course uh which was a lot more

1946
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:58,880
credible when plants started dutting

1947
01:33:55,719 --> 01:34:02,600
yeah but I assume what we were all

1948
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:06,199
calling dutting it was the hlv or

1949
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:07,800
hlb I talked with Tumi Organics and if I

1950
01:34:06,198 --> 01:34:12,000
remember correctly they did say that

1951
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:16,520
patient zero was Sour dub like that's

1952
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,198
the that's is that if you have hbd

1953
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:21,600
eventually your plants are going to

1954
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:25,279
start dutting correct yes yeah

1955
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:27,480
correct yeah cuz it was was uh it took

1956
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:29,599
over the San Diego I mean we can go into

1957
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:31,439
this next time yeah yeah know it's just

1958
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:35,600
a little taste of it so people know what

1959
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:38,719
to expect next time there you go yeah

1960
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:41,079
yeah because that wiped a lot of people

1961
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:42,239
out yeah it did [ __ ] [ __ ] a lot of

1962
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:45,719
us

1963
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:49,678
up that's what we get for

1964
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:52,960
trading yeah yeah it was it if it worked

1965
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:54,560
its way through as fast as I remember it

1966
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,000
then I find it hard to believe we're

1967
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:59,360
ever going to be rid of it yeah no it's

1968
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,679
it's it's total uh a lot of the

1969
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:03,399
libraries in Spain now it got

1970
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:04,920
transported over there via cookies and

1971

1972
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,359
