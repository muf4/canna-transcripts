00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,878
welcome to reader Syndicate 3.0 the next

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,638
evolution of the look into

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,000
counterculture that is Canon my name is

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,919
Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,320
started as a one-man mission for strain

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,160
history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,039
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,320
techniques breeding science strain

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
history and more our mission is to

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
combat the Nar the corporate cannabis

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
and Seed posers are obus skating for

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,840
their own Financial benefit welcome to

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,879
the underground We Are The

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,920
Syndicate hey everyone before we get

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,799
started I just wanted to let you know

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,439
that over at Riot seeds.com we're about

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,640
to drop some new uh goat farm gear some

22
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,079
of the last of the blue dream uh

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,520
feminized hybrids and we have the whole

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,399
blue and cross lineup blue so I'm call

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,760
Blue n blue EX blue and cross um

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,920
everything's half off right now so so

27
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:05,719
talking $100 and $80 a pack so be sure

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,400
to go check that out at rid seeds.com

29
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,798
and we have some high and Lonesome stuff

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,320
still we have some stuff from M Elite go

31
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,960
check it out while it's still going um

32
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,519
the sale's probably going to end in

33
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:21,118
about a week and a half so keep your uh

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:24,840
keep your eyes peeled on R seats.com

35
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:28,319
hey what's up everyone it's me and I'm

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,640
by myself which I hate more than anyone

37
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,398
even knows doing solo shows show but um

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,000
I haven't done a show on reversals in a

39
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,719
while um I think it's kind of necessary

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,840
a few of the reversal shows were kind of

41
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,759
[ __ ] like I had a co-partner that

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,478
had never reversed anything and decided

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,959
to interject his opinion on uh the

44
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,319
history of it how it's done etc etc so

45
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:53,640
it's time to correct the record on some

46
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,599
of that stuff also I I took a bunch of

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,320
questions from the Discord if you're not

48
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,038
a part of the Discord go to our patreon

49
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:03,000
join it $5 a month all the way up to $50

50
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,519
a month if you want um special goodies

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,239
you know every three months or so

52
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:10,079
unreleased stuff and uh yeah possibly

53
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,560
one of these months I'll be doing maybe

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,440
maybe be doing some reversals spr at

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,560
least in a small portion so people get

56
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:21,079
an idea of a one plant reversal um with

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,400
that said uh my history in reversals

58
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:29,280
goes back since 2006 um uh Jimbo hog

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,360
Gonzalez really taught me how to reverse

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,360
uh the Creator of hogs breath and along

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,000
with him I had a few other special

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,480
mentors which I will name which are

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,360
Ernesto from Buddha seeds again not big

64
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,399
Buddha seeds never interacted with Milo

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,000
um Buddha seed Spain and another person

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,000
that helped a lot despite him not uh

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,800
being a big fan of reversals at the time

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,800
and I don't know that he is right now

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,560
either is Shany baba um Shanty was a

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,280
major part of me understanding the

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,360
process how to go about it all the

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,598
reasons why he hated it and didn't love

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,640
it and uh yeah um I took it from a

74
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:14,280
different position at the time um almost

75
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:17,759
all seeds were regs uh unless made in

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,360
Amsterdam and it was looked down upon to

77
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:24,359
do reversals and you know I'm a [ __ ]

78
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,360
villain what are you gonna do okay so

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,480
with that I'll start off with the first

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,400
question

81
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,399
from yah y I think it's Yahweh

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,799
7233 first question and this is the the

83
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:43,039
first question I always get STS versus

84
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,159
colloidal silver um colloidal silver is

85
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,359
capable of re reversing some plants it's

86
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,359
not the best thing to use um back in the

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,920
day there was a paper by Mohan rammen

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,079
set and this is the landmark paper I I

89
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,878
believe it was late 70s early 80s where

90
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,239
they were comparing different reversal

91
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,280
types and St s uh uh which is silver

92
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,878
nitrate sodium

93
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,560
thiosulfate uh combination seemed to

94
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:13,560
work best it was it was

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,878
reliably you know able to reverse plants

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,478
back then of course there weren't as

97
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,159
many poly hybrids or shitty uh super

98
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,039
Afghan dominant hybrids that they were

99
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,160
trying to reverse so things have

100
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,360
definitely changed over the years um

101
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,520
second question is how does jellic acid

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,080
come into play now ga3 only comes into

103
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,319
play and when I'll say jellic acid

104
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,198
number three specifically comes into

105
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,959
play in a more advanced technique and I

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,400
wouldn't use it by itself but I will

107
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:46,439
bring it up later um jasmonic acid for

108
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:49,038
masculine IEDs I know nothing about that

109
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,839
um you do use a different reversal agent

110
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,959
for reversing a male to a female I don't

111
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,519
know anything about jasmonic acid or

112
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,879
masculinized seeds for that for that

113
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,439
matter um Commander Cochran asks I have

114
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,279
a nice female plant that I would like to

115
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,719
sell to get some seed stock one how many

116
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,879
plants should I consider using um great

117
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,800
question um if you've heard us talk on

118
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,800
the show a lot about uh reversals it's a

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,680
numbers game it's it's a it's always a

120
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,400
numbers game if you go in and you

121
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,959
reverse one plant and think that's going

122
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,758
to do it and you know knock up your

123
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,519
whole room odds are slim to none that

124
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,120
you're not going to have a successful

125
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:32,478
reversal um I like to have it you know

126
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,918
one to six so if I have 36 plants I want

127
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:39,680
six plants I'm reversing um and so on

128
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,719
and so up um that's the safe bet but

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,600
it's not always foolproof it's

130
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,319
definitely not always foolproof there's

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,759
plants that are very stubborn as uh even

132
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,800
CSI has talked about um triangle zittles

133
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,600
chem dog D some of these are very hard

134
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,400
to reverse and sometimes six plants

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,080
won't be enough uh second question from

136
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,159
Commander Cochran uh should I I flip the

137
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,560
donor one week two weeks ahead of the

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,680
receiver again depends if you're

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,680
reversing hemp you flip them at the same

140
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,800
time hemp drops pollen so fast and I

141
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,519
don't know why I really don't know why a

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
lot of time maybe it's because people

143
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,719
are popping hemp seed and just reversing

144
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,879
the seed as opposed to clones of said uh

145
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,120
hemp seed but in that case it's it's you

146
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:31,360
flip them at the same time um if you are

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,000
using something say gel right um I would

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,800
stagger it in I would start spraying

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,279
let's say if I'm going to do six plants

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:43,000
two plants two and a half weeks ahead

151
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:46,038
enter in two more plants two weeks ahead

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,560
enter in two more plants one and a half

153
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,318
weeks ahead and start there and stagger

154
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,839
them in and keep reversing them as you

155
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,680
go um the reason for that is it takes a

156
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,000
lot longer for pollen to drop and for

157
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,160
receivers to receive and you want

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,759
receivers to be receiving at the Optimum

159
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,599
time you do not want receivers to be

160
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,560
receiving to be receiving after the

161
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:09,399
hairs have died off because that kind of

162
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,598
defeats purpose uh dino grow asks is

163
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,399
there a difference in seeds from a

164
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,759
partially reversed and pollinating the

165
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,198
same plant from pollinating another

166
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,319
female plant of the same strain hold on

167
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,280
a second let me go reread this is there

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,439
a difference in seeds from a partially

169
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:27,559
reversed and pollin from a partially

170
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,319
reversed and pollinating the same plant

171
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,360
from pollinating another female plant of

172
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,639
the same strain can I pollinate half a

173
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,280
plant and consume the other half will it

174
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,400
still be quality

175
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,279
PD so it sounds like they're trying to

176
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:45,158
do half and half I don't recommend it

177
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,878
because one you barely get any plants

178
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,038
you bar you don't get as many seeds in a

179
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,240
reversal as you would a regular plant

180
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,639
two trying to control the pollen as a

181
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:59,158
[ __ ] um yeah I don't recommend doing

182
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,000
any of that possible not probable um not

183
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,560
advis

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,598
able all right stink box says when I

185
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,759
reversed a male it grew flowers all over

186
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,279
but in each flower it would throw a

187
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,199
couple nanners finally it pulled for

188
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,959
dumping pollen are the sacks because I

189
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,038
should have used more

190
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,878
spray or because that's just the way the

191
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:25,079
plant was so when you reverse a a male

192
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:28,680
to produce female flowers it will be

193
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,399
making female flowers on a male plant

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,158
that is to say

195
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,759
it it won't have the same Brack

196
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,519
structure none of that the reason you're

197
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,639
reversing the plant isn't to pollinate

198
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,879
it the reason you're reversing the plant

199
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,080
is to get an idea of what scents the

200
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,759
resin production stuff like that so when

201
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,920
you actually go and use that plant in a

202
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
real setting not reversing it you can

203
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,199
see some of those traits pop through

204
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,560
that's the only reason people are doing

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,200
that um I don't understand why uh the

206
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:01,599
seed question I don't understand any of

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,600
it at all um let's see if you have a

208
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,200
basic chemistry understanding what a DIY

209
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,519
recipe you find or have you figured out

210
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,800
something your spray that makes it

211
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:15,200
better more effective Etc uh you know

212
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,479
the DIY recipe of um is it it's been a

213
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,839
while yeah I don't [ __ ] remember I

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,680
don't remember it off the top of my head

215
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,680
but yes there there's definitely more

216
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,759
effective ways to do it than just using

217
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:29,559
the DIY recipe yeah there's a reason

218
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:32,200
that that people modify it over time

219
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,599
okay bin chicken do you use jelic acid

220
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,920
reversal spray of so do you find it

221
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,480
helps elongate the M flow clusters more

222
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,078
like a true M and how much G3 to use per

223
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,759
100 milliliters to achieve a good amount

224
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,519
of elongation so what we're talking

225
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,799
about here is Advanced uh Advanced

226
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,200
reversals and I'll just say real quickly

227
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:54,120
it's because these aren't really like

228
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,480
ordered super well um when using jellic

229
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,240
acid number three the only reason I

230
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,519
would use it is if I noticed a hard

231
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,560
cluster so when you reverse a plant a

232
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,360
female

233
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:07,759
plant you're going to get male parts on

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,800
a female clustering hard nugged plant it

235
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,519
doesn't look like a male that just drops

236
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:16,519
pollen and leans all over and all that

237
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,440
jazz um it's just not how it works so a

238
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,200
lot of times when it gets too hard

239
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:26,760
clustered one of the tricks to use is 75

240
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,000
ppms of dbolic acid number three and it

241
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,399
doesn't always work but it has worked

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,278
uh it's a little Advanced a lot of

243
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,078
people don't know how to make jellic

244
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:39,759
acid number three using alcohol crushing

245
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:43,759
it all down it's not all water soluble

246
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:48,360
as it claims um I do believe somewhere

247
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:50,799
in our patreon Discord there is a recipe

248
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,159
for making the jellic acid number three

249
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,199
in the first place okay um beginner

250
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,360
question on reversals let's say I have

251
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,079
two different cuts that I really like

252
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,720
and want to make a cross

253
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,919
does it matter which one I reverse just

254
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,879
for this one Cross or is it just luck of

255
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,559
the draw edit I should specify regarding

256
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,480
traits presuming both plants reverse

257
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,479
pretty much the same like CSI did

258
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,600
reversing chmd to chm91 and then vice

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,959
versa I guess the question is there

260
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,278
really any difference the plant

261
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,518
receiving the pollen versus the plant

262
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,759
donating the pollen yes there's a

263
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
difference um some have more of a

264
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,720
difference some have less of a

265
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,639
difference sometimes you'll see similar

266
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,959
siblings popping up in both um but it

267
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,159
does matter it does matter what is the

268
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:37,919
receiver and which isn't and usually the

269
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:40,958
receiver um is chosen by whichever plant

270
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,679
is easiest to reverse right like if chmd

271
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,479
is a [ __ ] to reverse then reverse chem

272
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:48,439
91 obviously that's that's that comes a

273
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,639
lot into play of uh why we choose what

274
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,120
we

275
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,320
do okay let's say I have plant a and

276
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,879
plant B is there a noticeable difference

277
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,560
in progeny between ab and ba if a is

278
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,399
male be as female is there a difference

279
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,119
in be yes we just answered this question

280
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,200
um is there any difference General Trend

281
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,560
in traits just depends on what plants

282
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,639
you're using uh there is no hard fast

283
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,919
rule um and you'll never this is

284
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,278
probably a question I get more than

285
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,719
anything is like is there a hard fast

286
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,078
rule on what's okay to reverse and

287
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,759
what's okay not to reverse and what's

288
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,599
better there's no hard fast rule

289
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,198
genetics line up the way they line up

290
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,480
it's like a zipper you know sometimes

291
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:31,879
the zipper's off

292
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,879
it's there's no hard fast roll what week

293
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:37,399
do you start using reversal and what is

294
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:40,600
the best dosing frequency um all that is

295
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,078
in on my page where you can go buy my

296
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,839
reversal spray it's on sale as much as

297
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,239
it's ever been right now so go check

298
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,920
that out right seeds.com go find the

299
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,278
reversal spray sections three different

300
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,479
sizes and all that info is there if you

301
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:55,399
don't know it it's because you haven't

302
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,839
gone it you haven't bought it uh

303
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,039
complete newbie question how much spray

304
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,320
would be needed recommended for a small

305
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,198
cell lookup style f project with just a

306
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,000
couple plants does the size of the plant

307
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,278
matter when attempting

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,278
reversal I mean like I said it's a

309
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:11,159
numbers game I don't recommend just like

310
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,679
willy-nilly trying to do it off you know

311
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,879
three plants in a in a Solo Cup that's

312
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:18,319
not really going to do too much for you

313
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,399
um does the size of the plat matter when

314
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,360
attempting a reversal yes and no um

315
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,078
obviously the bigger the plant the more

316
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,759
the pollen if it reverses well however

317
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:35,000
when you start spraying it it almost

318
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:37,120
almost always halts any vertical growth

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,839
so keep that in mind

320
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,078
too can you self one plant like if you

321
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,839
sprayed one branch could you use the

322
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,958
seeds from the other branches or should

323
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
you have separate Cuts as receivers I

324
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,559
understand you usually spray the donor

325
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,160
ahead of the receivers yeah I don't

326
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,399
recommend doing that um definitely

327
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,600
causes some issues again you can't

328
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,440
stagger that way and staggering is

329
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,480
necessary

330
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,600
um bong toes for Jesus feed leading up

331
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,600
to the spray after favorite size to do

332
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,079
the reversal also you go through so many

333
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,560
plants uh known Keepers what makes you

334
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,919
say holy [ __ ] I got to keep this one

335
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:17,679
forever um feed leading up to the spray

336
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,639
and after so if you're doing reversals I

337
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,319
like to also include nitrogen throughout

338
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,799
the whole feed just

339
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,440
because like you're you're making seeds

340
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,919
seeds need to do that and if you're

341
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,120
reversing it's not going to hurt it at

342
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,439
all it's not like you're going to go

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,759
smoke it you're not going to go smoke

344
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,320
the seed stuff after I don't recommend

345
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,919
it anyways um also you go through so

346
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,399
many plants known Keepers what makes you

347
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,799
say holy [ __ ] I got to keep this one

348
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,720
forever how that [ __ ]

349
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:47,838
smokes you know that's uh that's the

350
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,480
determining Factor uh which plant was

351
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,519
successful in reversing but extremely

352
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,879
difficult to complete won't reverse it

353
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,600
again Plants you haven't been able to

354
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,519
reverse how

355
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,320
many before you throw in the towel have

356
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,198
you ever reversed a long flowering plant

357
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,959
um successful in reversing but extremely

358
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:11,479
difficult to complete won't reverse it

359
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,838
again Clockwork Orange was very very

360
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,680
hard to to reverse but I did it a few

361
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,519
times but it there were plenty of fails

362
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,599
I know uh CSI would say the same about t

363
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:26,159
triangle Kush Kim dogd and Skittles all

364
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,839
the above um plants you haven't been

365
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,399
able to reverse uh we did get La a to

366
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,800
reverse once but it was only like six

367
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,720
seeds same with cherry pie um which is

368
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:41,120
weird because you'd think cherry pie

369
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,199
herbal might as well n but it doesn't

370
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,720
work that way how many times before you

371
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,919
throw in the towel I'm pretty stubborn

372
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,278
um there's not been many times where

373
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,120
I've just been like [ __ ] that I'm done

374
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,439
with this because if I was trying to

375
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,240
reverse it in the first place there was

376
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,839
a a necessary need for it have you ever

377
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,560
reversed a longer flowering plant I did

378
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,639
try with the Colombian black but I

379
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,318
didn't know what I was doing I was

380
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,839
trying to do it indoor and it's a 26

381
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:09,759
week flowering plant so yeah I have

382
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,440
tried did not

383
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,919
succeed uh how you feed plants reversal

384
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,639
would be some good information extra

385
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,198
nitrogen there you go answered it

386
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,360
yourself Mr Blue Groves extra nitrogen

387
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:22,758
feed it feed it a full range is there

388
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,440
any Merit to hunting for female pollen

389
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,800
doners in the same manner that I would

390
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,680
males to determine which female produces

391
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,159
the the best feminized Offspring as

392
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,559
opposed to reversing my favorite female

393
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,278
sh one feminized you know that's that's

394
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,599
a good question and yeah they like there

395
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,000
that comes into play every every single

396
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,000
thing in there comes to play um some

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,159
plants are awesome on their own but

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,759
breed for [ __ ] it's just how it goes uh

399
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,120
CCC any protective equipment recommended

400
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,159
when

401
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,360
spraying I wish I would have known this

402
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,399
a long time ago but I didn't so I didn't

403
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,278
wear masks I remember the taste of TS

404
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,639
being kind of sweet because it's been in

405
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,400
my mouth so much uh how would you go

406
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,120
about trying to lock in traits such as

407
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,319
nose and effect after selfing a plant

408
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,318
with only one known parent in general

409
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,558
how much Vigor and how much harder is it

410
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:19,318
to self a plant multiple times do you

411
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:22,240
tend to prefer back crossing over S2 S3

412
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,279
uh to lock in traits at all

413
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,880
so I'm going to try to answer this

414
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,678
question as best as I can um using an

415
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,160
example so I have my my Blue Bonnet

416
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,280
stuff then I have the blue incross stuff

417
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,080
which is like really really worked Blue

418
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,798
Bonnet stuff a few

419
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,439
generations and right now I'm

420
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,279
considering do I reverse the blue

421
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,600
incross because it's the best of the

422
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:47,160
best in my

423
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,480
opinion or do I go pop some of the

424
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,519
original F1 Blue Bonnet seeds that are

425
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,679
left and try reversing that only

426
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:58,918
because taking stuff in to a further

427
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,159
self-generation is like hypers speed

428
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,480
breeding and hypers hypers speed in

429
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:07,679
breeding and uh recessives come out from

430
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,240
that and blueberry already has plenty of

431
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,159
issues with recessives so I'm not sure

432
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,079
if it would be working in a Direction

433
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,559
they may all smell amazingly blueberry

434
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,759
but also be mutated and grow like slow

435
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:22,558
[ __ ] so yeah I mean there's different

436
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:25,000
reasons for different things um I I

437
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,200
wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily choose

438
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,640
like back crossing over S2s or S3s I

439
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,200
would just work it forward F1 F2 F3 F4

440
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,120
um I've done back Crossing uh like even

441
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,200
with the Bon stuff I did a blue Bonet F2

442
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:43,639
I did a blue on at bx1 and I didn't do

443
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,120
the S1 of that one yet um but that was

444
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,840
more or less just to see what was the

445
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:53,119
best case the backat crossing or the the

446
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,519
next the F2 filial generation and and as

447
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,119
of right now they both seem pretty

448
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:00,000
similar um the trait was so uniform the

449
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,479
blueberry trait was so uniform from the

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,480
jump

451
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:08,279
that yeah right okay so that gets to the

452
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,798
questions now I was going to walk you

453
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,240
guys through a typical reversal so let's

454
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,440
say you've

455
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,759
got two t0 obviously one tent for your

456
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,960
your vegetative state one massive tent

457
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:26,640
for your reversals right um again I like

458
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,159
to do a one to six so let's say you have

459
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,240
six plants

460
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,400
and uh you want to have one reversal

461
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,279
plant I still would go with like three

462
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,919
just to be safe even though it is a 1 to

463
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:42,440
six I would still do three to six just

464
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:45,200
to be to be sure um the idea is to keep

465
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,000
your reversal plants extremely healthy

466
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,558
you don't want them going through any

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,038
trouble any pain you don't want to burn

468
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,240
up you don't want any of that [ __ ] when

469
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,720
you're doing this [ __ ]

470
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,798
um it would be nice and easier if you

471
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,240
had a third tent where you could start

472
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:05,319
these plants um flowering before you

473
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,480
start your main flowering

474
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:11,439
cycle uh I would like again two and a

475
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,839
half two and a half weeks introduce one

476
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,679
two weeks introduce one one and a half

477
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,000
week introduce one then bring them into

478
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,480
the whole tent that you've already

479
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,038
started reversing you start spraying the

480
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,400
first second that you put them into

481
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:29,679
flower cycle all right now you'll slowly

482
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,200
watch some grow balls about day 21 it

483
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,000
takes about 21 days 21 to 24 I usually

484
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,080
say 21 to 24 days to start even seeing

485
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,319
balls knowing that this is working so a

486
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,960
lot of people don't have the patience

487
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:43,119
and are like I've been waiting two weeks

488
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,319
and I don't see [ __ ] it's not working

489
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:49,119
you wait 20 21 to 24 days it'll work it

490
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,879
always works however what doesn't always

491
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,319
work is that it'll drop pollen uh

492
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:59,320
dropping pollen is more of

493
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:01,960
a iffy kind of thing um but yeah yeah

494
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:04,639
that's really it you know you just let

495
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,840
them flower hope hope that some of them

496
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,480
drop balling and when they do [ __ ]

497
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,959
smack the [ __ ] out of it you know with a

498
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,759
[ __ ] stick hold it around the plants

499
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,960
bring the plants in that are that are

500
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,359
the receivers make sure you get all

501
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,720
their their stigma rubbed up in it

502
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,599
pistols whatever you call them rubbed up

503
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:29,440
in it try to cover everything and see if

504
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:33,439
uh it takes reversing isn't that hard um

505
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:38,200
it's just a lot of loss a lot of failure

506
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,720
so be prepared for that and yeah um it's

507
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,000
kind of a short episode but it's

508
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,960
something I wanted to go over because I

509
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,480
don't think I had a a beginning A to Z

510
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,480
on how to do this properly a nice

511

512
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,159

513
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,759

514

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,120
excellent episode um going to try to

520
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,159
work with Angus from the real seed code

521
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,678
to talk about land races one of my

522
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,360
favorite people on Earth to talk to

523
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,600
about land races um and heirloom lines

524
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:22,918
and what that means he's a very

525
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:26,079
thoughtful individual and uh

526
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,640
yeah you can't just go learn genetics

527
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,879
and then assume that you can learn

528
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,840
everything there is to know about uh

529
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,600
like heirlooms and land races is not how

530
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,359
it's work it's not how it works unless

531
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,359
you're a completely awesomely autistic

532
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,639
human that can memorize everything but

533
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,879
it's not for me so I like to refer to

534
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,278
other sources um when it comes to that

535
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,760

536
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:52,240
