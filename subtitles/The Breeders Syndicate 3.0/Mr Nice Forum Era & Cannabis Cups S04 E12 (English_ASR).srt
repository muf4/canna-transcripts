[Music]

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,840
what's up everyone so we talked earlier

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,119
we're gonna um

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
do a little

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,199
spotlight on um

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,480
my old man net yeah um yeah we're gonna

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,280
uh talk about the uh i think

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,439
the return of neville era when it was uh

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,879
mr nice 2009 to 2011 i think it was

19
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,558
somewhere in between there wasn't a full

20
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,519
two years but it was in there in that

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,038
region

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,159
so yeah

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,239
um we also we also thought too that

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,159
maybe we could do a little question and

25
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,239
answer oh yeah

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,479
matt's a lot better at reading comments

27
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,798
and does a lot more uh cultivating over

28
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,000
there than i do so yeah

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,600
ask away

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,118
you know and and maybe it might get

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,239
answered but we were chatting a couple

32
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,478
weeks ago

33
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,118
um sort of about that

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,280
that era and there's a bunch of stuff

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,200
that started happening at mr nice

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,840
because it was a new forum

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,840
and you know a lot of old timers and

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,118
heavy hitters started showing up and

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,640
saying stuff

40
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,438
yeah and so a whole lot of what we know

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,439
um

42
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,798
you know from the 80s or whatever in the

43
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,919
early 90s

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,520
um kind of got talked about extensively

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,879
by the people

46
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,879
10 years later 15 years later um and so

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,359
a lot of what we reference is like their

48
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,798
own words comes from that era that matt

49
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,519
was talking about

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,439
yes indeed yeah it was kind of cool um

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,280
when when neville popped back up i was

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,279
already on the forum and it was uh it

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
was kind of unexpected all of a sudden

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
he was there and answering questions and

55
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,758
it was like holy [ __ ]

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,360
you know

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,598
the guy that that

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
we all kind of looked up to most most

59
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,399
people that start selling seeds i mean

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
he was the

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,439
the dude a lot of us looked up to you

62
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,799
and we were finally able to ask him

63
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,400
questions we had

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,920
questions about certain things and he

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
was more than willing to answer

66
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,839
questions now whether or not we got uh

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,759
the most direct um true answers is is

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,280
still to be debated but it was a lot of

69
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,359
them were very very helpful and

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,080
informative people said mr nice with

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,879
shanti baba mr nice's website is is

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
still up and the forum is still active

73
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,000
it's not nearly as active as the era

74
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,598
we're going to discuss

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,080
um but it it definitely still exists uh

76
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,079
shanti baba and neville had a business

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,160
relationship that went on for quite some

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,680
time and they used howard mark's

79
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,120
likeness and

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
name essentially

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
so after

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,400
uh after neville left scentsy

83
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,359
he partnered in some fashion with um

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
shanti

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,760
and that led to a partnership with

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,360
greenhouse and arjun

87
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,519
and then when um when shanti and neville

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,959
left arjun and greenhouse they went off

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,959
and did mr nice in switzerland yeah um

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,878
and i think it was primarily shanti at

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,878
that point but howard marks and neville

92
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,199
i never saw howard marks have much to do

93
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,318
with anything at mr nice when i was you

94
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,560
know really

95
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,839
active um i do think he just owned a

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
part of it

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,158
because they used his likeness and name

98
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,958
yeah i think they i think he had a cool

99
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,798
name

100
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,280
and um i think they used him as uh

101
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,439
you know he had a very photogenic story

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,239
yeah and he was sort of at the part in a

103
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,359
time in his life um that selling his

104
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,799
story was a thing yeah yeah and his wife

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
had a book he had a book there was a

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
movie a lot of people haven't seen that

107
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,399
was released in the uk called mr nice

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,318
that was actually it was it was decent

109
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,360
it was decent about howard mark's life i

110
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,199
mean the the autobiography is fantastic

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
yeah um you know and just for people

112
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,039
that are listening or whatever he

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
bought somebody's identity in england in

114
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,279
the in the 60s who never really traveled

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,439
yeah and it was actually pronounced

116
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,159
french like mr nice

117
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,360
like nice france yeah like like you're

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
going to nice

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,639
yeah it was actually that's how it was

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
pronounced but he changed he just

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
changed it to mr nice

122
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,839
same spelling just different

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
you know

124
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,039
just different connotation or whatever

125
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,639
because back then

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,080
at least he says in the book you know he

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,918
bought multiple different people's

128
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,039
identities who were never planning on

129
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,120
leaving uh great britain yeah so that he

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
could have different passports and

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
different identities to go around to all

132
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,120
these countries and get away with all

133
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,959
this smuggling

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,478
pre-internet days were [ __ ] bombed

135
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,198
before they could check out all that

136
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,439
[ __ ] yeah so i mean in a way mr nice was

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,240
kind of a cool seed company because it

138
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,560
was a legendary old smuggler

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,680
of hashish and marijuana

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,639
and two you know um and neville and

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,280
shanti

142
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,478
yep so it was kind of like a sort of a

143
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,038
superstar collective if you will yeah

144
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,439
uh in terms of weed legends

145
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,079
well i mean mr nice i i can't honestly

146
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,478
say that neville was a part of mr nice

147
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,560
at any point

148
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,719
i'm not sure if he was i know he you

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,079
know he sold shanti a good deal of his

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
genetics so they were his actual

151
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,319
genetics when he was having legal

152
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,439
troubles i believe in australia

153
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,719
i think

154
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,279
i yeah i i mean i don't know i think

155
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,759
though that came later actually but what

156
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:48,000
i do think is that i think

157
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,680
howard marks and neville had a piece

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
i don't think so because when neville

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,160
came back one of the main things and and

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,800
we'll talk about this more in detail he

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,840
um he was really pissed that shanti only

162
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,759
ever paid him 250 000 for those genetics

163
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,758
when he needed that money and he felt

164
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,680
that he was owed a lot more so he didn't

165
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
have a piece he felt he was owed a lot

166
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,478
more because

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
but

168
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,399
maybe we should get before we get ahead

169
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,599
of ourselves yeah um

170
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,279
because what i think you're talking

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
about before is like when he was in

172
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,399
australia in the clink

173
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,720
how he got out uh was the drunkers

174
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,079
bought his business okay so this is a

175
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,639
different time whatever this is a

176
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,959
different time but he's had gave him 250

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,680
grand was his quote one of the ways that

178
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,519
we know shanti baba had access to a

179
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
bunch of this old [ __ ] that he claims to

180
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,959
have

181
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,600
is because neville told us that he sold

182
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,000
him his entire old seed collection for a

183
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,319
quarter of a million dollars yep yeah so

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,160
it's verification a lot of people claim

185
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,960
they have old things but how they got

186
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
them

187
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,918
the chain the command the chain of

188
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,319
custody is a little suspect a little

189
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,839
dubious yeah yeah you know shanti for

190
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,199
all of his claims uh you know his his

191
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,959
his origin story is phenomenal yeah yeah

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,199
we know that he at least had access to

193
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,519
these genetics at one time yeah you know

194
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,520
and so the question is is more of how

195
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,318
many of them does he still have

196
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,598
yes

197
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,840
versus did he ever have access yeah yeah

198
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,000
we know he had access neville gave him a

199
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,758
bunch of their collection when they were

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
working together doing the super silver

201
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,840
haze mango haze neville's haze thing and

202
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
the greenhouse gig

203
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,598
yeah and then at some point he sold him

204
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,679
his seeds and a lot of what

205
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,519
you know a lot of what is sold at mr

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,439
nice is claimed to have come from old

207
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,000
neville seed yes

208
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,439
quite a bit quite a bit of the stock

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,199
almost all of it except for the the

210
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,120
widow stuff yeah the widow stuff and

211
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,160
yeah it all sort of originates from

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,240
clones or old seeds from metal yeah and

213
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,319
it's corroborated by neville said that

214
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
you know he he sold them

215
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,199
yep

216
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,159
so i think part of the problem probably

217
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
part of the

218
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,560
the interesting part to people is going

219
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,918
to be what neville said

220
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
neville is one of those people that it

221
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,359
seems like every five or six years his

222
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,519
life burned down

223
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,400
um and even though he was one of the

224
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,399
originators and everybody grows his [ __ ]

225
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,560
um he didn't end up like arjun or

226
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,439
something he didn't end up filthy rich

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
um

228
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,959
before he died yes before yeah well

229
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,959
yeah exactly i mean technically yes but

230
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,959
no for most of his life he was not i

231
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,638
mean i'm sure mozart looks down and

232
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,878
thinks how many other people made money

233
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,840
off his music without a doubt but he

234
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,680
died a popper and a dirt grave you know

235
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah um but you know

236
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,000
neville was pissed that he felt like he

237
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,399
he started

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,559
he started the movement and he's the one

239
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,120
that exploded the dutch scene

240
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,038
yes and he ended up going to prison and

241
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,919
being chased by the dea and having all

242
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,399
these issues and everybody else was

243
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,439
profiting off things hugely that he

244
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
wasn't

245
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
yeah

246
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,480
and so instead of him ending up being

247
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,480
like you know a ford or you know a henry

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,920
ford type of thing you know i mean

249
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,920
actually it's more like this it's like

250
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,360
he was the tesla

251
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,519
not edison

252
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,200
yes exactly um and so you know he did a

253
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,039
ton of stuff and we're all indebted to

254
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
him in various ways but

255
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,199
um you know

256
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,240
you know there's the the scentsy era and

257
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
the greenhouse era and the mr nice era

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,879
and

259
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,440
you know um he had a lot of issues yeah

260
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,000
but what was cool is that when mr nice

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
set up his forum uh when shanti set up

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,440
the forum there was a bunch of forums at

263
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
the time obviously yeah i can speak to

264
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
them more than i can

265
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,519
um but

266
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,278
what happened is when neville decided

267
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,480
i'm gonna come out of the shadows and

268
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:44,958
start answering questions

269
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
on only mr nice's forum

270
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,039
yes

271
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,839
then

272
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,519
that basically did this thing where all

273
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,600
of a sudden all this stuff we've been

274
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,480
debating forever you could [ __ ] ask

275
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,639
him

276
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,639
the the part that i i found the most

277
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,720
interesting and because

278
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,879
like some of this is missing now like a

279
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
lot of the back and forth was during

280
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,879
this time when he popped up it was

281
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,519
almost a

282
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,838
a gang war between the icy maggers that

283
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,278
were like sam the skunk man

284
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,040
oh for sure

285
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,759
i was gonna i was gonna bring that up

286
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,439
that

287
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,679
basically like an enormous amount of

288
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,200
old-timers started popping up

289
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,120
um at mr nice and adding color and

290
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,959
adding depth and corroboration to

291
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,078
various stories

292
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,159
but then there was a camp at

293
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,799
there was like the neville camp at mr

294
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:39,039
nice and there was like the dave watson

295
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,679
sam skunk man thing at ic mac yes and uh

296
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,319
they took pot shots at each other yeah

297
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,559
there were epic videos they used um it

298
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,640
was an old website called jib jab and

299
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,199
you could do these kung fu

300
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,278
like videos and you could

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,040
put what the text says like write what

302
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,120
text you wanted in it and him and

303
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,199
neville would go back and sam and or

304
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
maybe like uh cash rock someone that was

305
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
friends with sam

306
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,120
um would do the half of it from sam's

307
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,480
point of view like talking [ __ ] about

308
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
neville and these kung fu things and

309
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,440
then neville would have one of us

310
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,000
write something funny talking [ __ ] back

311
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,600
at the icy mad guys and sam but i don't

312
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,159
think those videos exist anymore but

313
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,278
they were [ __ ] hilarious and i wish

314
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,519
they did

315
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,320
i mean what's interesting about that is

316
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,120
that for all of those battles there's

317
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,040
not really all that much that sam and

318
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,839
neville disagree on

319
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,000
no no you know like they back up each

320
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,240
other's stories quite a bit

321
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,320
yeah um you know there's a difference

322
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,440
there's a difference in they both agree

323
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,399
that you know neville got haze from sam

324
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
yes

325
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
um

326
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,839
sam i think is told three or four

327
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,759
different stories about exactly what

328
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,839
neville got yes

329
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,078
neville's been pretty consistent or was

330
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,680
pretty consistent yeah and what what had

331
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,599
happened he had one version and he just

332
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,958
kind of stuck to it yeah yeah he was

333
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
pretty good at like if he if he had a

334
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,759
version he stuck to it whether it was

335
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
true or not he [ __ ] stuck to that

336
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,439
[ __ ] i mean

337
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,879
it becomes hard it's like we and one of

338
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,639
one of the reasons why we wanted to chat

339
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,639
about this is because it relates to so

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,519
much different stuff today

341
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,519
and it was one of those rare times where

342
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,679
um you know matt and i and friends and

343
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,759
stuff we still refer back to tons of

344
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,559
those posts yeah

345
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:25,120
um because neville explained in detail

346
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,958
uh what he was up to and one of the

347
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,200
funny things about neville

348
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,479
is that not to say that not to say that

349
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,839
uh

350
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
he always told the truth or anything

351
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,800
like that but

352
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,799
um because he was first

353
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,958
he was a lot more open

354
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,679
than almost anyone yeah and just saying

355
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:49,039
not only what his hybrids were

356
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,359
but um who he got them from and how

357
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,120
yeah where after neville everybody

358
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
started to clam up

359
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,000
and mysteries of even what it was

360
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,919
yeah uh and where where they got

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
whatever they used from

362
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,639
i thought i think i think neville

363
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,519
realized pretty early on that despite

364
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,039
people having the recipe or knowing what

365
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
strains were in what that there was no

366
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,759
way they were going to be able to

367
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,879
reproduce any of the phenotypes or

368
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,039
anything that he was showing or

369
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,320
selections he knew really early on that

370
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,639
that wasn't going to be the case so

371
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
there was no reason to to

372
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,278
uh hide a lot of the the stuff though i

373
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,719
do personally one of my theories i think

374
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:29,360
he he hid quite a few things on um and

375
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,360
and lied about it but i just saw a a

376
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,039
comment that i'll just interject real

377
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,519
quick we have a i have an old buddy of

378
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,519
mine uh that just commented that he got

379
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,919
some old neville's haze from me

380
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,159
and i brought home when i when i had

381
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,360
brought home some haze from europe one

382
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,439
of these times

383
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,720
and i was testing him out at my house

384
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,800
you know and he had like this 10 by 10

385
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,040
spa he had a big garden in his backyard

386
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,479
in mendocino county uh but he had the

387
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,759
space that was unused and he was like

388
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,759
dude you want to give me some heads i

389
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,039
just have this space i got this section

390
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,198
of the bed i didn't fill in you want to

391
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,519
give me some head that's nice though i

392
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,559
gave them i gave them like four or five

393
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,839
of these haze plants right in july

394
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,359
okay now you got to realize like the

395
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,279
whole back of the thing is full of six

396
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,199
foot tall sour diesels

397
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,720
all kinds of different strains big bushy

398
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,120
strains been in there for a couple of

399
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,560
months and i gave him like four clones

400
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,560
this big

401
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,559
well fast forward two and a half months

402
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,559
and these things are four feet above the

403
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,119
top of his fence

404
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,958
they took up the whole 10 by 10.

405
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,799
i think he ended up cutting him down

406
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,000
around thanksgiving and they weren't

407
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,679
done

408
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,198
it was killer weed though even though it

409
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,159
needed probably another two or three

410
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,639
weeks

411
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,399
but we we tried out these four little

412
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,799
clones and they turned into this

413
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,879
ginormous jungle weed

414
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,000
yeah that went everywhere it was pretty

415
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,559
intense

416
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,958
yeah that other cold chemd that i that i

417
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,399
had um it was it was one of those ones

418
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,119
you could flower as a ceiling it would

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,198
be [ __ ] eight nine feet tall just

420
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,039
candelabra style i mean it was just it

421
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,278
was funny too because like the way is

422
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,278
the way his backyard went it like sloped

423
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,198
down and so you really could never see

424
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,439
anything even if he grew huge plants

425
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,519
back there yeah and then i came over and

426
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,199
there's like these giant branches poking

427
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
up over the fence where you'd never seen

428
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,039
them before yeah uh but it just got to

429
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,560
the point where that thing was gonna it

430
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,599
was growing eight inches a day in every

431
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,958
direction

432
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,440
yeah so it just like exponentially like

433
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,399
you know yeah shit's wild to watch how

434
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
quick it can grow it was and so but

435
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,879
so what you know one of the things is

436
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,799
that when we talk like about a lot of

437
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,958
the when we did a bunch of the podcasts

438
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:39,198
on like the neville era and the seed

439
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:41,919
bank era yeah uh a lot of what we say um

440
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,919
you know comes from that later time

441
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,879
uh nuance and stuff that neville

442
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,759
answered

443
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,399
yep the questions um you know in at the

444
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,600
mr nice era and so that also did things

445
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,639
where it brought some people out of the

446
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
woodwork

447
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,320
um like uh some uh some pretty big

448
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,278
people in europe were commenting on it

449
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,600
uh and ortega popped in and started

450
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,759
commenting on what he had given neville

451
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,278
and what neville had given him

452
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,120
and so all of a sudden you're watching a

453
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,559
bunch of these like old school legends

454
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,799
that started it

455
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,078
yeah and they're chatting back and forth

456
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,399
about what

457
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,078
what they did for each other yep and

458
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
what's what's amazing with that is you

459
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,638
always wonder when you only have one

460
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,560
person telling a story

461
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,320
you know how do you how do you

462
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,399
corroborate it how do you make sure it's

463
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
true how do you weed out the [ __ ]

464
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,720
yep

465
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
you know and then also you can get two

466
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,560
or three people talking about the same

467
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
thing and you know who they all are

468
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,319
and you're like okay well that's

469
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,559
you know yeah it's probably about as

470
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,320
good as you're gonna get

471
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,518
you know so

472
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,480
um yeah so neville neville just openly

473
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,560
discussed all the parentage

474
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,240
of all his strains he didn't really have

475
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,638
any mystery strains

476
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,440
yeah and he discussed how and where he

477
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,120
got all the breeding material

478
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,079
and he was probably the last person to

479
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,799
do that

480
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,798
yeah yeah because to this day like some

481
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,599
of the second round of stuff

482
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,558
um you know like th seeds or serious

483
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,198
seeds or you know some of those kind of

484
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,720
people there's still mysteries that 25

485
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,839
years later we have no idea what the

486
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,519
parents were or where they got them from

487
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:22,240
paradise seeds why won't you tell us

488
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,798
yeah apparently one of the worst foreign

489
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
all this all the second wave neville was

490
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,200
just like here's i mean like to the

491
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,120
point where like we confirmed that you

492
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,160
know he went back to america and he got

493
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,639
g13 and the pacific northwest hash plant

494
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,880
from two grower friends of jorge

495
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,679
cervantes yeah

496
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,880
and he paid 500 bucks for him yep

497
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,360
uh you know our our buddy greg who uh

498
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,600
old marine who uh

499
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,639
you know matt interviewed um you know

500
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,000
they laid out the nl story

501
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,720
back and forth

502
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,240
you know pretty big time and cleared up

503
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,600
a bunch of that so it's like oh i got

504
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,079
the no i got the northern lights from

505
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,839
this guy i got these two cuts from this

506
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,918
guy i got this from over here i got

507
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,759
these things from sam skunk man and

508
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,759
here's the crosses of all

509
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,599
yeah and so it made it like it made it

510
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,558
pretty cool for historians or whatever

511
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,918
to try to figure out um

512
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,839
people just asked about the mango and

513
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,840
the ssh we can get we can talk about

514
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,599
that but it made it really cool to

515
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,918
figure all that stuff out because he

516
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,759
gave the layers

517
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,840
where all the second wave of of uh

518
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,640
amsterdam seed banks

519
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,720
uh it was all mystery

520
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
yeah for the most part yeah they were

521
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
right yeah they would rarely tell you

522
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,558
what the parents were they would rarely

523
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,880
tell you the origins of the parents it

524
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,079
was like here's the strain name here's

525
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,840
what it looks like here's our

526
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,480
description

527
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,639
that's all you know yeah and there's

528
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,720
like ak-47 or

529
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,559
or collie missed or like

530
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
paradise scentsy star

531
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,599
um there's a bunch of stuff where you're

532
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,880
just like oh you still have no idea yeah

533
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,558
30 years 25 30 years on and you're still

534
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,720
even parentage or where they got it or

535
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,639
who they got it from or what it was

536
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,319
bubble gum same kind of thing same kind

537
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,679
of thing yeah you know th seeds same

538
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,200
kind of thing there was various things

539
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,240
they basically just said headies from

540
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,440
america

541
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
yeah but you know th seeds people adam

542
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
and

543
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,519
uh simon from sirius and tony from sag

544
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,839
martha they all worked under neville for

545
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,839
a time

546
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,240
and none of them ever admitted that they

547
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,960
that they got anything from neville and

548
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
used it in their own work ever yeah it

549
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
sounds like they probably should have

550
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,480
i would think so you would think that

551
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,880
they you would think that they did it

552
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,200
but they won't they don't say

553
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,640
yeah i know they don't remember i mean

554
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,279
dunn might now

555
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,160
go back and say certain things but he's

556
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,720
not the most consistent no you know but

557
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,360
they just it was it was more like the

558
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,919
they just decided that secret sauce was

559
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,599
best yeah yeah

560
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
and from then on

561
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,959
the

562
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,360
you know the pulling the wool over your

563
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,798
eyes about strains became ingrained in

564
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,519
cannabis

565
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,759
and being open was rare

566
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,319
yeah so it's a really it's a real it's

567
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,798
kind of a treat to be able to just

568
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,879
talk about all this neville stuff

569
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:23,119
and he just laid out what it all was

570
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,360
yeah now sadly like with the rename game

571
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,279
um there's a ton of neville work in a

572
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,719
bunch of our modern [ __ ] but it all goes

573
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,678
by different names

574
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
yeah

575
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,559
yeah

576
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,558
so you just have no idea

577
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,359
yeah you can trace some of it back and

578
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,798
you can make guesses

579
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,479
right yeah you can make some educated

580
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,240
guesses but that's about all we got and

581
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,519
some of them i know there was stuff that

582
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
he would look at he'd be like oh yeah

583
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,319
that's my xyz you know like with modern

584
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,720
strains and he would say what he thought

585
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,038
it was but i mean even for him it was a

586
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,279
guess at that point at that point yeah

587
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,599
and so you know and during this i should

588
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,038
say during this era uh i was starting to

589
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,240
have kids and stuff like that this is

590
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,480
like a really um active era for mac

591
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,798
um and so you were messaging a bunch

592
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,558
with neville you were actually you know

593
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,480
so not only would he answer things

594
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,720
publicly on forums

595
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
that anybody could log in and see

596
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,759
but he was actually pretty active in

597
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,839
communication via email and dm

598
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,759
uh through those forums then

599
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,759
yeah and so any number of people had a

600
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,640
bunch of private conversations that

601
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,158
revealed more info yeah yeah a few of us

602
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,120
were really um

603
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,480
we we gained uh what you would i i would

604
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,558
assume would be a friendship but it

605
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
didn't work out that way but a few

606
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,558
people were able to to ask him detailed

607
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
questions and he would respond he had a

608
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,558
really shitty um connection out in

609
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,558
australia as far as his modem so

610
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,879
the the amount that he could pop up and

611
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,480
talk was very minimal and it was always

612
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,039
frustrating for him

613
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,120
um that's something i remember greatly

614
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,279
um but there were also you know like

615
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,279
when one of these dudes comes back out

616
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,960
of nowhere and everybody wants something

617
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,119
from them you know a lot of other people

618
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,440
showed up that were uh other seed

619
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,959
breeders that that wanted a piece of it

620
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,400
you know they wanted a piece of him so

621
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,440
you had people like charles scott

622
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,919
showing up from um briefer man reefer

623
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,279
yeah and that that was a big part of

624
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,360
what happened and

625
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,519
the falling out of neville and his

626
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,000
disappearance and then and then we had

627
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,440
our good friend uh kanga kangativa he

628
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,519
probably worked with him closer than any

629
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,080
of us um out in australia he worked with

630
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,400
them hands-on and he was doing a lot of

631
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,319
the actual hands-on breeding and

632
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,000
creation of strange while neville wasn't

633
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,480
doing as much that but directing more

634
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,119
from his area but i do know that neville

635
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,558
was doing some work with his son on a

636
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,719
few different things including a g13

637
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,279
line isn't it kanga that provided us

638
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,880
with the one picture of the hazy male

639
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,639
that we think is legit

640
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,159
i think so i think that is the the

641
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,000
kangas pick yeah

642
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,120
it's his pick and it was posted on mr

643
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
nice from his tours going over to see

644
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,759
the switzerland era mr nice

645
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
um you know breeding projects and

646
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,200
something like that

647
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,679
um because you know a lot of those guys

648
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,279
as shanti and neville has said

649
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
you know even though they were partners

650
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,359
with arjun and they were moving a bunch

651
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,759
of weed and seeds through

652
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,839
greenhouse yeah because greenhouse was

653
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,359
sort of like the harbor side for lack of

654
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,399
a better term it was sort of like the

655
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,000
big dispensary yeah right and so they

656
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
were still kind of illegally growing

657
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,880
weed and illegally making seeds but then

658
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,159
there is like a packaging wise they

659
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,600
could show up the greenhouse and they

660
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,240
could sell it through them

661
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,240
yep right and so when switzerland open

662
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,839
up these guys finally saw a way of like

663
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,319
holy crap i can do breeding on a

664
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,558
greenhouse level yeah i can do things on

665
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,359
a much bigger scale i'm not going to be

666
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,839
restricted to like these you know these

667
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,599
these canal boats that can turn into

668
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,359
groves and these apartments and these

669
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,399
houses and these different things you

670
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,158
know

671
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,640
um and so a lot of people came out and

672
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,640
visited uh shanti and people like

673
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,919
breeder steve and stuff in switzerland

674
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
because all of a sudden they had all

675
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,400
these projects that they wanted to do

676
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,038
and they started doing a bunch of work

677
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,278
yeah making a bunch of seed and we

678
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,960
should also probably say that like the

679
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,200
one of the things that i saw at least as

680
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,480
like a big interest in

681
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,240
mr nice and shanti baba at the time

682
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,079
with the seed bank was that

683
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,919
at that point

684
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,240
neville was famous enough that everybody

685
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,520
wanted access to his old strains even

686
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,359
then

687
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,319
um and

688
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,479
you know

689
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,399
the seed bank was gone and nobody really

690
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,720
trusted sensei anymore

691
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,360
yeah so they sort of viewed what neville

692
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:39,038
had given shanti as the last legitimate

693
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:41,199
you know uh source yeah

694
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,519
right because because neville gave him a

695
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,440
bunch of clones and tons of old seed

696
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,079
yeah and then he sold a bunch of that

697
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,720
and so at that point we're talking 2009

698
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,558
2010 everybody everybody had already

699
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,960
figured out that cincy had outsourced

700
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,359
everything to spain right yeah and

701
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,679
nobody really trusted their work anymore

702
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,399
yeah their era was sort of done

703
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,320
yeah

704
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,759
so if you wanted that old [ __ ] everybody

705
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,200
sort of felt like that was the spot

706
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,599
and then neville

707
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,919
and then neville coming online

708
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,399
sort of gave it a ton of legitimacy

709
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,520
yeah because you're asking about his his

710
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
old [ __ ]

711
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,359
and this and for people that don't know

712
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,319
like looking back i saw someone um bring

713
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,319
up the cbd era this is before all that

714
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,519
this is before this is during the era

715
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,000
where shanti was [ __ ] militant about

716
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,240
[ __ ] femme seeds being trash femme

717
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,159
seeds are [ __ ] gonna ruin cannabis so

718
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,240
there was no cbd

719
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,520
crew there was none of this going on he

720
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,440
was militant anti-femme and the cbd crew

721
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,679
was some of the first femme worked and

722
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,360
it was done by jaime of resin seeds not

723
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,880
shanti at the time i know someone

724
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,719
mentioned that earlier but that was a

725
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,480
little bit later of an era

726
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,640
yeah i mean uh

727
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,319
we talked about on an earlier podcast

728
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,880
that when matt and

729
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,240
rascal and hybe and others started doing

730
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,600
reversals

731
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,159
it was not met with a warm welcoming

732
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,759
situation by most of the community there

733
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,240
was a lot of breeders and there was a

734
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,359
lot of retail people that thought it was

735
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,440
cheating

736
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,959
and long-term harmful

737
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,840
yeah yeah and so i think i think

738
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,558
you know shanti's cbd work is more like

739
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,480
five or six or seven years ago beginning

740
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,000
yeah there was mostly high mate it was

741
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,919
time made from resin seeds it was

742
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
originally it was called resin seeds and

743
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,960
he released a strain called cantatonic

744
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,919
he had a fake hp 13 sour diesel hybrid

745
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,240
he had a few others um there was a mk

746
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,919
ultra hybrid that he had

747
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,278
and um a lavender

748
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,360
lavender bubble gum that he had and

749
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,720
they didn't do so well but the catatonic

750
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,240
did kick these crazy cbd lines so after

751
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,240
a few years of resin seeds being around

752
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,640
they started working into just the cbd

753
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,798
stuff which became a cbd crew so well

754
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,520
you know the reason why we wanted to do

755
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,519
this

756
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,960
this chat or whatever is when matt and i

757
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,200
were chatting about like the beginning

758
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,919
of the fem and reversal era

759
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,000
this is the exact same era yeah it's

760
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,400
just that there was like four or five

761
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,679
dudes at most playing around with

762
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,759
reversals

763
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,600
and the vast majority of the seed

764
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,839
community was still looking at it like

765
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,079
some [ __ ] tech that was gonna lead

766
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,158
us down the wrong path yeah and it's

767
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,199
funny how within 10 years that thing

768
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,480
flipped

769
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,558
and the regular seeds became the unicorn

770
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,240
and the reversals became the standard

771
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,359
operating procedure

772
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,278
yeah

773
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,398
man we have a [ __ ] rock star in here

774
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,000
he [ __ ]

775
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,918
brought skunk he [ __ ] knew everything

776
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
i love people um

777
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,120
yeah so

778
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
there was the big dust up between icy

779
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,519
mag

780
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,398
and

781
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,319
and mr nice on the forums that would be

782
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,479
like uh me bigger

783
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,879
uh unfortunately hempy a lot of other

784
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,038
people on the mr nice side that were i i

785
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,278
was admittedly kind of drinking the

786
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,519
neville kool-aid i thought [ __ ] those

787
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,159
guys you know it was it did cause a lot

788
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,158
of uh headaches for shanti and shanti

789
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,080
was not too stoked when neville came

790
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,640
back not only because

791
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,839
of the chaos between sam and the drama

792
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
that was stirred up there was already

793
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,398
some drama going on between aryan and mr

794
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,158
nice calling each other [ __ ] water

795
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,278
boys and whatnot

796
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,278
so

797
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,558
when neville came back he also like i

798
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,880
said

799
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,798
demanded more money from shanti and

800
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,360
that's what slowly started the decline

801
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,200
of neville there

802
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,479
i don't know that shanti necessarily

803
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,558
liked the attention that neville was

804
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,159
getting either because he was getting

805
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,000
kind of overlooked

806
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,760
uh in favor of neville being there

807
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,278
answering questions and i remember in

808
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,720
some of the private communications if

809
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,398
nell isn't even alive anymore to talk

810
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,558
about it i don't think he'd mind me

811
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,239
sharing private communications but that

812
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,678
was one of the big things was that

813
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,120
shanti didn't want him on the site he

814
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,278
felt this is from neville's point of

815
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,038
view not shanti's he felt that shanti

816
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,119
was very angry that he was there and

817
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,158
getting all the attention on his site

818
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,639
and

819
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,039
he wanted to go elsewhere by that point

820
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,080
this is maybe six months after being

821
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:07,839
there

822
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,519
but he had a major interest in the

823
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,839
american genetics

824
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,240
too he wanted to know more about the og

825
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,759
kush's the bubba's the g13 he wanted to

826
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,960
see what had happened with that over

827
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,679
time um but yeah his interest seemed to

828
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,840
mostly swing over to the american what

829
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,240
we would call indicas during that time

830
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,038
yeah and i mean there's an aspect too

831
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,079
that

832
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:33,038
i've told matt this a bunch um but i

833
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,839
feel like the 90s and the early 2000s

834
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:39,119
and stuff and what happened in europe

835
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,359
uh you know history repeats itself often

836
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,038
and we see it over here in america now

837
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,678
and the various beefs and the various

838
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,759
camps and issues and which side do you

839
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,480
get on who do you believe more

840
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,720
yeah

841
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,880
and it also goes to show that

842
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,519
in a era of prohibition uh and gray area

843
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,480
it's often hard to maintain partnerships

844
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,359
over the long time without one or more

845
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,679
parties getting upset at each other yeah

846
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,359
it gets rough you see it right now with

847
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,798
i mean i don't need to name the cruise

848
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:13,759
but name most of the faint super famous

849
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,319
lines that are out right now or families

850
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,640
and you know the that stuff getting

851
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,759
famous broke up friendships

852
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,759
yeah

853
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,319
you know and neville wasn't particularly

854
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,480
friendly with any of his ex partners

855
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,398
he wasn't particularly friendly i mean

856
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,720
to some people

857
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,639
but it just depended um i really felt

858
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,960
like

859
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,640
he was friendly to people that he

860
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,038
felt could take him

861
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,919
further in what he was interested in if

862
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,558
that makes sense the the dutch i've said

863
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,320
this a ton too but the dutch have a very

864
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,759
different approach than americans to

865
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,079
marijuana

866
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,679
um they are much much much more money

867
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,720
and business oriented

868
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,240
yeah um

869
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,960
you know and

870
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,120
um you know americans have kind of like

871
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,399
a hobbyist weed nerd approach at least

872
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,719
with some people

873
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,879
yeah uh neville was a blend of the two

874
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,278
and that neville did give a [ __ ]

875
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,840
uh and neville did love weed

876
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,599
but he also was dutch and had a massive

877
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,319
strain of that

878
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,558
like he wanted money they wanted rep

879
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,240
yeah he was an early proponent of if

880
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,678
you're using my [ __ ] you should give me

881
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,759
credit and money

882
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,919
yes and like i said he had he had to

883
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,640
deal with shanti for 250 grand he gave

884
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,720
him all the strains he came back x

885
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,240
amount of years later and said wait this

886
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,720
[ __ ] made more than i thought he

887
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,880
was gonna make he owes me money and he

888
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,558
and and this is not from shanti's side

889
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,919
this is from neville's side neville came

890
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,759
to me and said

891
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,679
i you know what do you think about this

892
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,599
this is the amount of money i got that i

893
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,960
think i deserve more money don't you and

894
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,158
i'm like

895
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,319
so by by that point you know from

896
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,159
you know i i mean i i had a couple

897
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,398
conversations with neville nothing super

898
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,240
deep or as extensive as you did but

899
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,038
my general sense from what friends of

900
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,839
his told me is that he felt like

901
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,839
he broke barriers

902
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,759
and went to jail for it

903
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,000
and then ben and alan drunkers got to

904
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,720
got rich off his company

905
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,720
yeah right and then he left and he and

906
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,399
he worked with greenhouse and shanty and

907
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,038
arjun and arjun got hella rich

908
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,479
yeah off his weed and his seeds and his

909
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:25,119
work and all the cups that arjun won was

910
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,679
when shanti and neville were there

911
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,518
you know in fact neville arjun got

912
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,519
banned for a couple years for trying to

913
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,079
bribe a cup

914
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,278
after uh neville and shanti went and

915
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,000
remember that

916
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,880
yeah

917
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,038
he got he got pinched for uh um so

918
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,840
neville felt that like he had helped

919
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:47,759
make other people rich

920
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:49,439
yeah his whole career and shanti was uh

921
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,798
you know the latest person that was

922
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,720
doing that to him

923
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,398
yeah except for i don't think shanti

924
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,240
actually got nearly as rich as ben and

925
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:57,759
alan drunkers from senator

926
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
definitely not from arjun i think

927
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,240
arjun's probably worth hundreds of

928
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
millions of dollars

929
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,359
um yeah

930
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,038
you know so it was a little unfair to

931
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,240
single shanti out

932
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,359
yeah uh you know um but he but he but he

933
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,880
felt like that had been happening his

934
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,839
entire career

935
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,320
yeah

936
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,798
you know and so he felt like

937
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,918
and he and he felt like he undervalued

938
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,918
his company

939
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,679
to selling it to scentsy because he

940
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,038
needed to get out of jail and he needed

941
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,440
lawyers and he needed to get back to

942
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,480
holland yeah and so he and he kind of

943
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,399
felt like shanti did the same thing

944
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,240
in the sense of he was down and hurting

945
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,239
and needed money

946
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,720
and so he took a shitty deal for his

947
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,278
seeds because he couldn't turn it down

948
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,319
yeah but he should have gotten way way

949
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,038
more

950
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,759
yeah i mean 250 grand for that area is

951
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,359
bank proceeds like i can't it blows my

952
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,278
mind blows my [ __ ] mind that chance

953
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,719
he was even able to pull 250k out his

954
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,440
ass you know you got to realize he's got

955
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
it

956
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,558
listening that this this happened in the

957
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,760
90s or whatever so

958
00:33:54,558 --> 00:34:00,240
it's probably literally like 480 to 540

959
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:02,798
000 in today's money yeah yeah there's a

960
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,038
lot of money 200 when we say 250 000

961
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,480
this is happening in the 90s yeah it

962
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,159
probably actually with today's inflation

963
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,440
it would be a few mil

964
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,240
you know i mean because i looked it up

965
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,320
like 20 20 if you made 20 an hour in

966
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,719
1994 which is when i started became an

967
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,639
adult it's 39 bucks now

968
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,480
yeah okay that makes sense so it's

969
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,000
probably double so yeah maybe it was

970
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,719
half a million bucks

971
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,639
yeah which is still a [ __ ] ton for seeds

972
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,519
for a seed dude back then [ __ ] yeah

973
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,000
especially old seeds yeah you know that

974
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,039
like you know and all that and so

975
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,398
um

976
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,838
you know but i mean it's also one of

977
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:36,878
those things where none of us were in

978
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,799
the room

979
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,199
when any of these deals were being made

980
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,399
so it's hard to know if neville was sour

981
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,838
grapes or he got he got worked

982
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,679
yeah um

983
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:48,398
from the way he told it

984
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,720
he

985
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,960
it sounded like he was sour grapes and

986
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,559
and like i and at the time i liked him a

987
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,398
lot and i

988
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,320
but even from his important point of

989
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,960
view listening to him it sounded like we

990
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,119
were [ __ ] entitled dude what the [ __ ]

991
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,838
i mean the other part of it i'll say is

992
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,720
that

993
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,320
um

994
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,239
when we were talking about history sort

995
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,838
of the last three big

996
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,799
things that neville did that made a

997
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:15,119
bunch of money was that 1997

998

you know taste changed and all that kind

1001
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,679
of stuff so

1002
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,800
like

1003
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,639
after he sold shanti those seeds

1004
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,720
shanti didn't have a period like

1005
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,480
greenhouse did or like

1006
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,519
scentsy did where they just like

1007
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,519
dominated and made [ __ ] tons of money

1008
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,679
yeah he did he didn't really have that

1009
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,280
because because there's so many many

1010
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,838
more people were in it there was so many

1011
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,040
more canadians doing it there was like a

1012
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,920
bustling

1013
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,279
uh north american scene hitting it just

1014
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,880
as that was taking off the north

1015
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,880
american scene had just started booming

1016
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,280
during that era so i mean you know

1017
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,680

[ __ ]

1030
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,760
from neville and shanti so they won

00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,480
with white widow and with peacemaker and

1032
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,160
with super silver haze and with

1033
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,000
you know i mean i know you're smiling

1034
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,838
but it's just like that probably was

1035
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,480
some of the better weed over there oh

1036
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,960
i'm sure i mean barney's farm they were

1037
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,240
taking turns buying the cup so yeah you

1038
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,679
know and

1039
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,519
and all that and so you know people

1040
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,399
don't know this but there is we could

1041
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:46,000
get into some more depth on that so like

1042
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,000
some of the various beefs that people

1043
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,079
might have interest in because

1044
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,599
um you know the big issue between

1045
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,480
neville and

1046
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,720
um and sam at least as far as i

1047
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,159
interpret it is twofold one they argued

1048
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,639
over the exact

1049
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,639
haze that neville got

1050
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,679
right yeah and two

1051
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,838
um

1052
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,759
you know uh neville thought he was a

1053
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,078
shady american that had ties to the

1054
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,880
government that [ __ ] neville over

1055
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,039
yeah so i'll go over this one and i'm

1056
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,640
gonna preface this because i know mr

1057
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,559
watson has been upset with me even

1058
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,039
bringing it up so i will preface this

1059
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,199
this is neville's story um everything

1060
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,320
i've researched has shown it not to be

1061
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,000
correct um as best i can tell i mean

1062
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,720
there's no definitive

1063
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,679
thing saying someone's not a snitch um

1064
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:36,000
the way neville recounted it was that

1065
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,759
when sam went over i'm not gonna say his

1066
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,559
real name when sam went over to

1067
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,560
amsterdam he went over and he was always

1068
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,078
there with the dea handler granted the

1069
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,440
dea is not supposed to function outside

1070
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,079
the united states but this is the story

1071
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,639
i was told um that he had a dea handler

1072
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,920
everybody knew who his dea handler

1073
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,199
handler was and they in neville's

1074
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,838
quote was

1075
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,358
he was called sam because of uncle sam

1076
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,799
because he was a government worker that

1077
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,880
they said they gave him the nickname

1078
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,560
which we also know is probably not true

1079
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,559
um but yeah he said that neville or that

1080
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,279
sam went over there he was the first

1081
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,920
person and only person to get the dutch

1082
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,519
government's approval to grow cannabis

1083
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,760
if i remember correctly which he was

1084
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,440
presented for greatly by everyone

1085
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,680
exactly because there's an american

1086
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,039
getting the licensing and neville

1087
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,879
basically said the only reason he got it

1088
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,480
was because of the dea handler and the

1089
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,880
dea wanted to make money in amsterdam

1090
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,119
and control the cannabis uh

1091
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,920
you know it's very very conspiratorial

1092
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,480
and and a theory but

1093
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,760
there's been no proof to any of that uh

1094
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,639
that i can tell

1095
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,160
and there's an aspect to it where

1096
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,159
you know when i first started going over

1097
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,078
to amsterdam and really got got started

1098
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,879
getting to know some of these people

1099
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,800
yeah um or friends of theirs or whatever

1100
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,039
is that it became quite evident just

1101
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,200
like today in today's cannabis world

1102
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,880
that there was camps of friends over

1103
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,598
there and they all didn't get along and

1104
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,960
they had differing stories and beefs

1105
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,240
over origins

1106
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,838
yeah you know so neville's version of

1107
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,479
the haze story

1108
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,960
is that he got you know a bunch of bulk

1109
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,639
seed from sam including skunk one

1110
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,960
and then he paid a bunch of money for a

1111
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,719
bunch of old seed from

1112
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,599
you know he said it was 15 years old at

1113
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,679
the time he got it from 70ish

1114
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,559
um and out of thousands and thousands of

1115
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,598
seeds he got maybe eight or ten to pop

1116
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,078
yeah

1117
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,640
and that's from those seeds is all the

1118
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,359
breeding that he did and all that yeah

1119
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:36,559
and uh sam has said that he gave him

1120
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:39,199
seeds that he made while in amsterdam

1121
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,119
he said he only gave him clones and the

1122
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,960
shittier clones

1123
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,559
um he's had a few different stories of

1124
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,838
what he's told neville that he's written

1125
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:49,759
down like like at various forums yeah um

1126
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,759
so he said that he gave because now

1127
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,720
because sam did go over there

1128
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,800
and

1129
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,759
uh make open pollinations and

1130
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,240
reproductions of haze

1131
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,880
yeah and he says that everyone over

1132
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,199
there got those reproductions and no one

1133
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,559
got original seed yes

1134
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:10,960
but wernher did posse and carell at ssc

1135
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,078
and neville all say they got seed from

1136
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,119
america

1137
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,920
yes

1138
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,800
from

1139
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,720
from sam them directly yeah before he

1140
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,720
had gotten the house before he got set

1141
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,118
up before anything yeah that he was

1142
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,759
selling seeds to make money

1143
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,920
uh to get himself started over there let

1144
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,599
me answer this one mccormick speaks

1145
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,159
really favorable of sam is that because

1146
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,920
he knows or because he's got

1147
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,358
a hold of some of those skunk and nlc's

1148
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,920
well sam had nothing to do with the nl

1149
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:38,880
seeds um mccormick's very favorable

1150
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,880
because

1151
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,400
it's just

1152
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,599
what he does

1153
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,720
um

1154
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,880
they've been friends for a long time

1155
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,279
and you know and i mentioned that and

1156
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,039
stuff and so you know a lot of the stuff

1157
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,880
that that net that todd sells

1158
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,960
um is

1159
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,838
stuff that sam has sold through others

1160
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,159
for a long time that never got stopped

1161
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,239
being sold that yeah i mean like he

1162
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,920
claims ancient skunk one and durbin and

1163
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,919
this and that and hayes

1164
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,000
and you know sam has never wanted to

1165
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,559
sell directly to the public

1166
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,000
um so he's always wholesaled to people

1167
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:22,880
like sssc or neville or the flying

1168
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,960
dutchman or seeds men or

1169
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,400
you know because it's legal to buy a

1170
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,480
kilo of or kilos of seed directly in

1171
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,720
holland at the time yeah

1172
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,119
it was legal to do wholesale seeds

1173
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,439
within holland yeah and so he just never

1174
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,480
got involved with retail and so

1175
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,318
todd sells the same stuff that you could

1176
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,400
get from seedsman that you could get

1177
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,480
from the flying dutchman that you could

1178
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,480
get from any number of different sources

1179
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,000
and so the sourcing is legit but he

1180
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,358
tries to make it seem like they're

1181
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,960
ancient and rare and they've never

1182
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,000
before been released

1183
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,920
when

1184
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,599
as matt said they've literally been a

1185
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,800
constantly available

1186
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,119
forever

1187
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,680
it always blows my mind every time

1188
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,599
someone resells skunk one to something

1189
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,199
new that's all i'll say on it i mean

1190
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,800
granted there's skunk one is obviously a

1191
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,919
very desirable plant it's in a lot of

1192
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,680
strains it's in almost every strain ever

1193
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,599
um that's still around there's some

1194
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,039
skunk one and almost everything unless

1195
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,440
there's like an heirloom does it make

1196
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,960
well it makes you know uh

1197
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,639
you know and the funny part about this

1198
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,679
maybe we should talk about this a bit is

1199
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,199
that

1200
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:30,559
like while sam is undeniably a mammoth

1201
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,799
influence in cannabis yeah and neville

1202
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,000
is also undeniably a mammoth influence

1203
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,039
in cannabis

1204
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,199
yes they enjoyed immensely

1205
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,400
denigrating the other person

1206
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,879
as a chump

1207
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,760
as often as they could get away with it

1208
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,280
yep you know and so you really couldn't

1209
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,280
take what they said about each other it

1210
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,680
was like really hard because they

1211
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,359
disliked each other so much and this

1212
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,759
someone asked earlier about the afghani

1213
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:56,639
one why did neville hate it so much well

1214
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,079
there's

1215
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,118
neville said that he thought it was what

1216
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,720
a boring hot dull boring high no flavor

1217
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,880
and there's corroboration of this i mean

1218
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,639
like remember when the when in high

1219
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,680
times when the connoisseur went and

1220
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,078
visited

1221
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,159
rob his friend yes uh there's various

1222
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,039
people that said it was like a

1223
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:17,279
heart-pounding shitty body high yeah it

1224
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,119
wasn't that tasty that it just it didn't

1225
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,319
lead to too many good places it wasn't

1226
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,760
that great

1227
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:23,838
when that popped up

1228
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,520
all you had was like colombians and

1229
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,440
mexicans so they had a certain specific

1230
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,079
height that they expected from from

1231
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,679
cannabis and here comes afghanis

1232
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,920
and it is much different than the dutch

1233
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,799
are used to any of them yeah you know

1234
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,880
and i mean the the afghani one i mean is

1235
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,119
you know it's mel frank's weed really

1236
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,838
yeah um you know the afghani and the

1237
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,318
durbin that sam took to holland was

1238
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,719
directly from mel frank

1239
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,800
and i will go down to my death saying i

1240
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,679
think afghani one is the reason skunk is

1241
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,519
stunky uh skunk one or super skunk is

1242
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,358
skunky and i think that the afghan t was

1243
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,880
afghan one and i think neville hit it

1244
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,719
because he [ __ ] and that's why he

1245
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,039
hated afghani one so much because it was

1246
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,519
in every last thing of his that's my

1247
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,279
theory no proof it is based on [ __ ]

1248
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,679
nothing though don't don't even listen

1249
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,119
to me on this mat

1250
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,279
but that's that's the funny part is that

1251
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,800
when we talk about this [ __ ] okay

1252
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,480
there's an aspect where you start

1253
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,000
talking about all the various people

1254
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,358
there

1255
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,199
and then people

1256
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,199
start poking holes in that person's

1257
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,439
character because it's easy to do

1258
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,358
because they all have sus spot stuff

1259
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,800
that they're involved in yeah and then

1260
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,480
at some point you're like well which of

1261
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,440
these shady [ __ ] is telling the

1262
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,719
truth

1263
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,880
yeah

1264
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,639
right because they all have

1265
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,160
you cannot be like well this is the more

1266
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,759
high character guy

1267
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,679
yeah no it's it's real hard to do you

1268
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,520
know what i mean like actually no i can

1269
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,000
take that back sam skunk man has never

1270
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,239
[ __ ] me over neville has

1271
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,239
so like that but i mean what i mean by

1272
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,759
that though is that like you know for

1273
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,519
instance it's the same thing i have with

1274
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,560
that tk origins dude or whatever about

1275
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,280
the kush

1276
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,838
like once sam has written three or four

1277
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,519
stories of what he gave neville

1278
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,599
yeah well then which version do you

1279
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,679
believe because they can't all be true

1280
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,000
it's an unreliable narrator so he's got

1281
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,159
to be lying about some of it yeah

1282
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,599
because he wrote it all down yeah one of

1283
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,440
those cannot be

1284
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,720
true at least two of those cannot be

1285
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,119
true if there are three states one of

1286
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,879
them yeah one of them may be true might

1287
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,240
but all the but there can only be one

1288
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,000
that's true and so all the other

1289
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,598
versions have to be [ __ ] so which

1290
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,599
version

1291
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,640
yep do you go with

1292
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,480
yes

1293
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,279
you know yeah

1294
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,800
and

1295
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,359
you know and when you know when we

1296
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,400
interviewed corel from sssc

1297
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,838
he said that sam gave nev that sam gave

1298
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,639
neville seed

1299
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:43,279
yes but sam was on cannabis world or

1300
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,039
icmag or whatever talking about how not

1301
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,960
only did he not give

1302
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,880
neville anything good but they only him

1303
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,720
and rob gave him the shitty clones that

1304
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,160
they didn't like as much and overcharged

1305
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,078
him because he was a dick

1306
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,759
yeah

1307
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,000
you know and and then he said that he

1308
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,000
gave him oped seeds that he'd already

1309
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,119
made in amsterdam and he never got any

1310
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,838
original [ __ ] yeah but the weird thing

1311
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,079
that i'll say about that is that uh csi

1312
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:10,719
and i and matt and stuff we all talk

1313
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,880
about how plants don't lie

1314
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,358
and strangely even though sam

1315
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,559
religiously disses what neville did and

1316
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,799
got

1317
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,838
the vast majority of the haze cuts that

1318
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,480
people hoard and want are from neville

1319
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,559
work yeah

1320
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,119
you're not finding a lot of good stuff

1321
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,639
in any of the positronics hayes sam

1322
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,280
hayes direct stuff or even even even the

1323
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,279
the the corel stuff i mean there's not a

1324
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,440
lot of keepers in america of any of this

1325
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,000
stuff you know and so all the stuff you

1326
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,559
talk about all the nl5 haze versions all

1327
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,920
the you know all most people's haze that

1328
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:49,920
they know of is some hybrid of nevilles

1329
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,760
i always wondered why sam never truly

1330
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,639
worked hayes

1331
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,160
um

1332
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,400
being that he was the source for it and

1333
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,559
he only released it and ops and stuff

1334
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,119
it's the most baffling thing ever yeah

1335
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,559
because and matt and i chat about this

1336
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,480
too where it's like

1337
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,199
um you know we have some friends that

1338
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,280
firmly believe sam everything yes and

1339
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,279
then there's and then there's me and and

1340
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,760
matt who kind of like

1341
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,519
com we we acknowledge his massive

1342
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,280
contributions and we think he's done a

1343
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,199
ton of stuff but that doesn't mean that

1344
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,000
we think he's 100 accurate on the way he

1345
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,598
throws it all down either no i mean it

1346
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,960
would be the same for me if i'm telling

1347
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,559
a story if

1348
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,880
if i don't like someone i'm probably

1349
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,559
going to minimize how much impact they

1350
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,920
had on things because from my opinion

1351
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,480
they didn't have much impact on [ __ ]

1352
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,760
because they were liars but but you know

1353
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,920
the two weirdest things to me about sam

1354
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,720
is that what matt mentioned which is

1355
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,760
hayes was his favorite line

1356
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,838
and then he spent the next 30 years

1357
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,000
by his own admittance only open

1358
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,838
pollinating it trying to keep it as wide

1359
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,358
as possible and never doing any

1360
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,799
directional breeding

1361
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,000
yeah

1362
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,240
too much

1363
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,838
yeah you know someone said what about

1364
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:04,078
sam skunk hayes sam skunk hayes was so

1365
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,960
unsellable for people that it was like

1366
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,200
the classic freebie from c yeah from

1367
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,039
seed boutique see there was so many of

1368
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,159
them these seed boutiques got kilos or

1369
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:13,279
whatever and they could never move

1370
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,279
enough of it

1371
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,599
so if you bought seeds in the earlier

1372
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,680
mid 2000s chances you were going to get

1373
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,000
freebies of skunk haze

1374
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,159
or skunk thai haze or don't talk yeah

1375
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,760
the thunk yeah that's what they called

1376
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,598
it the thunk and i'm not dissing it i'm

1377
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,200
just saying that like it just wasn't

1378
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,440
what people were buying and so there was

1379
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,279
way too much of it and so they gave it

1380
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,720
they gave a bunch of it away you know

1381
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,119
someone asked about connoisseurs

1382
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,439
genetics doing in the uk with neville's

1383
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,280
old work um i i don't know that

1384
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,039
connoisseur he wasn't around connoisseur

1385
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,319
was not around hanging out with us when

1386
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:45,519
neville came back he wasn't in the

1387
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:47,759
conversation

1388
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,960
i don't know where his sourcing comes

1389
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,240
from on his level stuff so i can't

1390
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,639
really comment on that i can just say he

1391
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,679
wasn't a part of our crew and he wasn't

1392
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:58,239
before that either so i don't know where

1393
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,318
he fits in in the equation you'd have to

1394
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:02,479
ask him

1395
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:05,039
so i i mean you know but basically what

1396
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,480
it boils down to i'll say this about him

1397
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,239
or anyone else

1398
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,199
is that most people

1399
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:10,879
um

1400
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,519
when they start their own haze lines

1401
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,280
they get hybrids from neville

1402
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:18,000
like you know maybe not directly from

1403
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,720
him but some kind of clone only yeah or

1404
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,599
they got seed like for instance soma uh

1405
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:26,318
his haze work was based off some g13 by

1406
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,480
haze a seed that neville gave him yeah

1407
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,800
and he found a male and that male was

1408
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,440
the start of his seats yeah

1409
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,280
um neville felt like the collie missed

1410
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,760
and a lot of other sativas in holland

1411
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,880
were all based off his nep his his haze

1412
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,720
work

1413
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,400
and they just didn't want to admit it

1414
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:43,358
yeah they didn't want to say it was just

1415
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,720
his

1416
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:49,358
yeah um but you know all the nl5 haze

1417
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,239
all the pif all the ssh all the mango

1418
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:55,279
haze all the neville's haze amnesia all

1419
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:58,399
that it's all from cuts neville selected

1420
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,559
and crossed

1421
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,079
you know or and then people took took

1422
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,519
that stuff and did what they wanted with

1423
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,160
it and so i know that

1424
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,920
i know that connoisseur or whatever he

1425
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:09,679
claims he has some old cuts that were

1426
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,680
floating around europe

1427
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,039
and he's got you know matt was talking

1428
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,039
about some of that some of the stuff

1429
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,480
that uh congravido was helping neville

1430
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,679
with

1431
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,358
something

1432
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,879
uh yeah sorry

1433
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,318
uh but you know he was doing a bunch of

1434
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,200
that what was it it was like neville's

1435
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,039
haze mullen baby madness stuff like that

1436
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:28,719
he was doing some hybrids because

1437
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,358
neville was basically interested in the

1438
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,439
grail of the grail project yeah which

1439
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,000
was trying to work on that trying to get

1440
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,880
a fire haze line but he felt the haze

1441
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,199
genetics were too narrow i actually did

1442
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,519
during that time i did one that was a

1443
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,719
god it was like clockwork orange the

1444
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:48,719
piff and we called it uh and uh above

1445
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,480
afino called the kids grail during that

1446
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,239
time

1447
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,920
yeah the outback haze comes from that

1448
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,679
work yeah there was a bunch of stuff

1449
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,960
that now he called it the holy grail

1450
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,480
project um and it was basically him

1451
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,519
trying to figure out things he could

1452
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,639
cross old haze cuts and seed to

1453
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,519
that would maintain that crazy sativa

1454
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:09,358
yeah

1455
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,440
and so they released a bunch of stuff

1456
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,039
with various neville's hazes neville's

1457
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,079
haze was actually not supposed to be

1458
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,039
released

1459
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,559
it was the first step in the holy grail

1460
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:23,358
project yes it was them taking an uh an

1461
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:26,240
a5 and crossing it to the c dad and

1462
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:28,078
getting both hazes in one plant

1463
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:30,399
yeah and it just so happens they found

1464
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,400
this crazy pheno and decided to release

1465
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,358
seats

1466
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,039
you know

1467
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,279
right i mean that's pretty much what it

1468
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,318
was um

1469
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,319
but

1470
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:42,000
there was uh you know so yeah i mean he

1471
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,838
would have various partners at various

1472
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,119
times shanti was doing things shanti

1473
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:47,920
actually has

1474
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,400
i think something he calls grail haze

1475
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,079
um you know right now on his site you

1476
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,160
know he's got i haven't looked he's got

1477
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,599
a couple new haze projects

1478
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,118
of things that him and neville were

1479
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,480
working on and he just decided to

1480
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,680
release

1481
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,358
um

1482
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:02,799
you know and i think it's it's all from

1483
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,639
that same

1484
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,960
same general era when they were crossing

1485
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,639
various sativas to each other and seeing

1486
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,400
what was going to pop up

1487
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,318
you know yeah i don't think it's

1488
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,480
anything more than that really

1489
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,838
it's just super you know super

1490
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,679
equatorial probably

1491
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:21,358
yeah someone's asking about um ingomar

1492
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,919
to shaman's haze you know i never got to

1493
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:25,519
run that but i did grow some of ingomar

1494
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,519
to shaman's other stuff like the purple

1495
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:31,119
widow and all i can say is that stuff

1496
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,800
does not do well in california indoor it

1497
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,119
is the i

1498
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,599
i have never seen anything herm so bad

1499
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,680
and autoflower so reliably

1500
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,519
then ingomar de shaman's work grown in

1501
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:43,598
the u.s it might not do that over there

1502
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,679
it might be acclimated for outdoor

1503
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,480
amsterdam but over here it did not do

1504
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,919
well

1505
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,159
yeah and i mean a lot of those haste

1506
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,318
things it's like they're

1507
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,639
they do do phenomenal outdoor like those

1508
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,039
those ones i gave my buddy but

1509
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:59,598
you know none almost none of us living

1510
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,880
near the equator yeah that's the problem

1511
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,800
so you're not you're not you're gonna

1512
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,559
have a hard time finishing any of it

1513
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,920
yeah i didn't take the time to acclimate

1514
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,599
them at the time i didn't even know what

1515
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,440
acclimating was when i grew them so

1516
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,359
there was no like there was no me trying

1517
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,559
to grow it grow a clone of it and also

1518
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,400
it was autoflowering so you couldn't

1519
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,319
take clones of it anyways somebody asked

1520
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,400
do you have any hazes currently yeah i

1521
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,599
mean i i have uh

1522
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,280
um

1523
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:27,119
you know i have a uh a cube in black uh

1524
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,280

1526
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,720

1527
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,440
spino

1528
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,959
so yeah i have i have four or five or so

1529
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,318
hey someone just said creepy out of

1530
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,079
colombia

1531
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:42,558
that's funny that's remember i told you

1532
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,640
a long time ago over on mr nice's site

1533
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,880
there was someone that was from columbia

1534
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,719
that sent me seeds of crippy it was

1535
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,720
spelled c-r-i-p-i and i always

1536
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,239
pronounced it creepy because i didn't

1537
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,838
crippy wasn't a word at the time that

1538
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,838
people were using in california so i

1539
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,358
just i thought it meant creepy and i

1540
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,519
thought he was home i'll mention this

1541
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,279
for a second that uh someone was just

1542
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,719
mentioning that um

1543
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,839
you know uh

1544
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:08,318
metal haze um metal haze came out i

1545
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:11,119
believe in the early two early mid

1546
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:13,759
2000's forum era that's flowers by these

1547
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,400
guys dutch flowers and they wrote

1548
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,520
amazing ad copy for the time

1549
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,760
their descriptions of how they how they

1550
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:24,079
describe their seeds they were offering

1551
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,040
was certainly an early case of using

1552
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,800
advertisement and language to sell seeds

1553
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,159
because they got people drooling over

1554
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,960
the ship

1555
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:35,920
right

1556
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:38,559
yep um and i believe our buddy bodie

1557
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,720
doesn't he have a metal haze

1558
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,280
f3 or something like that he put out

1559
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,679
recently yeah he put out one and and the

1560
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,280
rev had his cut of metal haze me and him

1561
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,719
did some stuff with it

1562
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,640
um it's a positronics haze 19 skunk one

1563
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:53,838
according to jojo and he's the one who

1564
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,679
supposedly made it for richard

1565
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:58,960
calrissian who sold it as dutch flowers

1566
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,519
that's that

1567
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,798
yeah so um you know

1568
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,039
the uh

1569
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:06,559
um but it you know at the time it was

1570
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,000
like metal hey i mean they would always

1571
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,319
claim that it would sell out within a

1572
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,760
day or two being released yeah and a lot

1573
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:12,880
of stuff did and a lot of stuff their

1574
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,960
stuff

1575
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,200
they were really good at the forums of

1576
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,599
getting people to be hyped up and yeah

1577
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,719
their computer and ready to buy when it

1578
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,280
dropped

1579
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:25,519
yeah they were early adopters of that

1580
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,920
kind of technique i grew a bunch of

1581
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,199
metal haze and metal haze f2s from seed

1582
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,240
lines and i grew

1583
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:36,000
revs cut and refs cut to me was the

1584
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:37,519
supreme version of any of that stuff any

1585
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,358
of that stuff it was so much better than

1586
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:41,358
any of the a lot of stuff that i saw

1587
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:43,920
from the uh the seed lines was mostly

1588
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:45,920
jungly flower that was not anything

1589
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,920
viable for today's market it wasn't even

1590
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,480
that great of smoke but his his metal

1591
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,119
haze cut um the revs was more i would

1592
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,119
say skunk one dominant um in its in his

1593
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,200
flower time and its structure but still

1594
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,358
with a hazy twist to it and a lot of

1595
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:02,000
terpene and i should say before i forget

1596
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,598
somebody mentioned that um the dutch

1597
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,920
flowers used to claim that it was named

1598
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,240
metal haze because of metal halides

1599
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,440
yeah and that's actually true um they

1600
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:13,598
went on and on and on about how

1601
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,838
growing their haze under metal halides

1602
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,920
brought out the

1603
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,759
equatorial uh aspects of the sativa

1604
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,838
because of the type of blue

1605
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,720
um and if you grew it under hps it

1606
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,000
wasn't going to do the same thing

1607
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:27,039
it's [ __ ]

1608
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,480
[ __ ]

1609
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:30,400
i'm just saying that's what they said

1610
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,000
yes that's their copyright but that's

1611
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,960
literally what they said they said that

1612
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,838
it

1613
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,400
but the original description of

1614
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:41,759
positronics haze 19 skunk one was that

1615
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,000
it had a metallic coppery smell yes but

1616
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,160
that was of course dutch flowers never

1617
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
ever admitted their sourcing for it no

1618
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,480
no of course not no

1619
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,358
that's like this stuff all existed as a

1620
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,679
metallic haze from positronics but

1621
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:58,798
everybody kind of forgot that that whole

1622
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:01,679
copywriting from that and just moved on

1623
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,599
uh no mercy supply i remember them

1624
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,039
i don't think they sold much to

1625
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,640
the us though

1626
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,239
but yeah people were somebody i don't

1627
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,000
know hopefully the person that asked me

1628
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:14,719
who was joining see someone said is the

1629
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,039
c5 male still alive uh and that's uh

1630
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,159
there's a thing called c5 but that's

1631
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,599
actually a

1632
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:23,279
northern lights 5 by c ma female yeah

1633
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,760
and that cutting is actually in in

1634
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,119
holland and it floats around america now

1635
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,640
the sea male

1636
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,798
uh

1637
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,719
shanty says he has it

1638
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,880
and there's great debate amongst our

1639
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:38,959
crew if he still does or not he says he

1640
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,599
has afghan tea too he says he has it um

1641
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,599
yeah the funny part about the the afghan

1642
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,559
tea party is what he says is he lost the

1643
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:48,960
skunk part of the super skunk yeah so

1644
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,880
male 1 yeah i do think

1645
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,880
because i've seen shanti do this before

1646
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,400
with the um the g13 widow that he may be

1647
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,720
leaving out

1648
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,000
um a part of the genetics and saying yes

1649
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,239
we have afghan t but it's probably an

1650
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,798
afghan t hybrid like ash on one of those

1651
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,399
so he says that he still has the

1652
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,119
the cmail

1653
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,119
we know that for years he had it

1654
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,358
neville says he gave it to him

1655
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,240
uh you know uh

1656
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,480
you know

1657
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:19,279
matt's buddy uh posted a picture of it

1658
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,199
from the swiss days in full flower

1659
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,839
that we have uh but there's great debate

1660
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,358
amongst the crew what he has and doesn't

1661
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:28,558
are you familiar with any of the kiwi

1662
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,920
seed stuff the mako haze and the um no i

1663
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,000
mean i've heard you i've heard you and

1664
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,358
crybaby and friends talk about it i

1665
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,920
think

1666
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:38,159
i think damp crane might have bought out

1667
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,358
kiwi or vice versa i can't it's been a

1668
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:43,598
while uh i will say that

1669
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:45,838
is my favorite probably it's it's

1670
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,559
probably the coolest coffee shop

1671
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,440
when i was going it's ambiance the way

1672
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:54,079
it was built uh it would have it had

1673
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,760
really nice weed you know it had really

1674
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,798
good weed um

1675
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,319
often you know and so i like them

1676
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,480
yeah you know i mean i haven't been

1677
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:04,400
there in a long time now so who knows

1678
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,838
but at least back then they were the

1679
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,760
bomb

1680
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:09,039
yeah um

1681
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,160
so

1682
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:14,239
uh yeah people have their a5 and c5 does

1683
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,199
people are talking about a5 and c5 which

1684
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:18,239
are both

1685
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:21,039
uh nl5 haze cuts one uses the a dad one

1686
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:23,118
uses the c dad they're both alive in

1687
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:26,079
europe and america

1688
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,079
um they're super political

1689
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,519
uh so it's very hard to breed with them

1690
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,200
it's very hard to advertise that you

1691
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:31,838
have

1692
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,598
yeah that's been them

1693
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:36,880
big [ __ ] issue like i know people

1694
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:39,440
would like you know the nl5 crossed a5

1695
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,519
and c5 or the hawaiian lights crossed to

1696
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,639
it would be nice if we could do stuff

1697
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,400
with that but

1698
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,480
you know politics are politics and

1699
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,240
people are [ __ ] and the the thing

1700
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,480
about the dutch is that with old cuts

1701
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,639
and stuff like that it's all business

1702
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,159
yeah so if they're not making money off

1703
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:55,920
it and you don't have permission on it

1704
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:58,318
they don't really want to give you the

1705
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,838
right to do it yeah and then you'll get

1706
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:02,798
a bunch of crap from them over it

1707
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:04,400
you know

1708
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:05,599
uh is kind of is kind of the way it

1709
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,318
works

1710
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,079
you know um and uh

1711
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,358
yeah so

1712
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,039
you know they

1713
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,440
but that's that's an issue you know like

1714
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:17,279
we don't know what shanti still has

1715
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,519
no we don't and um

1716
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,599
i i did try to to actually make a

1717
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,759
purchase a big purchase from shanti some

1718
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,359
some people know about this in our crew

1719
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,520
where i i was going to buy everything he

1720
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,279
had with afghan tea just to see what

1721
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,639
what popped out of it but he wouldn't

1722
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,798
tell me what he was going to send me and

1723
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,519
just wanted me to send him you know

1724
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,280
thousand plus dollars on uh on a whim

1725
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,159
and i kind of backed off from it i kind

1726
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,519
of i wish i would have but like you know

1727

that always happens it always [ __ ]

1767
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,880
happens yeah it's right dramatically

1768
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,598
to figure that kind of stuff out but i

1769
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,160
have some i have some i have four or

1770
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,200
five hazy things from shanti and then i

1771
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:19,279
have like

1772
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:21,679
four five six you know skunk afghan nl

1773
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,960
type things from him just to see

1774
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:24,558
yeah you know

1775
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,838
um

1776
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,920
i don't even know what that's in

1777
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:30,400
reference to

1778
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,760
i'll just leave that one alone

1779
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,599
sometimes i ignore the comments

1780
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,200
sometimes i look at them but that one i

1781
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,480
don't know i don't know

1782
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,960
um what

1783
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,440
i don't know but but that's uh that's

1784
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,559
that word itself you know it really only

1785
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,599
has like one connotation in american use

1786
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,280
fleshy flaccid member i just flaccid in

1787
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,280
itself i mean when do you use it you

1788
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,960
know yeah yeah it makes me immediately

1789
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,960
think of elon musk for some reason i

1790
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,119
don't know why yeah i mean you know

1791
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,119
because he probably you know he's

1792
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,640
whatever so yeah

1793
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,079
um but i you know i will say that uh

1794
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:05,279
yeah ortega

1795
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,318
uh there's a and there's a bunch of

1796
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,319
mystery around that because

1797
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,960
maybe this is unfair but shanti is a

1798
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,760
little bit like uh cornbread ricky

1799
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,159
and that uh he talks in riddles a lot of

1800
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,599
times and even when he explains stuff

1801
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:21,038
that's very i think this isn't this

1802
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,000
isn't a diss to either one of them by

1803
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,359
the way

1804
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,960
but i'm just saying like

1805
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,400
they write this these like three four

1806
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,400
paragraphs about something and at the

1807
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,000
end you're like what does this mean

1808
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:35,358
yeah crime is also very very um

1809
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,599
verbose and and uh mystery writing i'd

1810
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:41,358
say crybaby is good at that yeah he's

1811
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:44,318
got he's got a good uh mystery ad copy

1812
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:46,558
uh you know iambic pentameter yeah i

1813
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:48,079
mean there's you know language you know

1814
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,359
language matters when you're trying to

1815
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,240
evoke

1816
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,400
you know

1817
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,639
something or whatever and so voters yeah

1818
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,920
yeah i mean shanti is sean yeah cryptic

1819
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:57,519
shanti can be

1820
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,039
very clear

1821
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:00,559
sometimes shanti in two or three

1822
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,640
sentences can answer something that

1823
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,319
you've been wondering about for 10 years

1824
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:05,838
and then not answer something else

1825
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,159
that's very simple in three or four

1826
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,679
paragraphs so i one thing i got to add

1827
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:12,318
because i did say earlier that he was

1828
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:17,038
one of the anti-femme guys despite all

1829
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:18,400
of that in 2008 2009 he went out of his

1830
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,559
way

1831
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,318
despite hating feminized work not

1832
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,319
wanting to do it himself he was one of

1833
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:28,079
the first people to really really

1834
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:30,400
educate me more about feminized work how

1835
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,559
to properly do it and not just you know

1836
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,240
be throwing [ __ ] at a wall he gave me a

1837
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:35,599
lot of recipes he gave me a lot of

1838
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,038
advice during that time and he's

1839
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,760
integral

1840
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,599
he's

1841
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,839
he's very integral into american

1842
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,079
feminized lines because of that you know

1843
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:45,519
so despite him having negative opinions

1844
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,160
on that he was still kind enough to take

1845
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:49,759
the time to educate me and mentor me on

1846
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:52,239
femme stuff so i thought that was really

1847
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,760
cool i would definitely say that uh in

1848
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:57,838
our crew of friends i'm team shanti yeah

1849
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,359
i like him you know i think he's done a

1850
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,119
bunch you know

1851
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,639
to kiss him on the mouth

1852
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,838
you know i don't know necessarily about

1853
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,239
that

1854
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,558
uh but um

1855
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,879
but he but you know he he's been in it

1856
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,559
for a long time uh he's another one of

1857
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,240
those guys that like he kind of took the

1858
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,480
torch from neville

1859
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,598
um you know he's done a bunch of big

1860
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,440
work

1861
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,480
uh he's been heavily involved in a lot

1862
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,079
of things

1863
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,280
and he's done something that's really

1864
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,000
hard

1865
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,240
which is he's he's he's sold seeds for a

1866
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,159
living for a quarter century have you

1867
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,199
ever grown into any of the mandalas

1868
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,798
stuff

1869
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,239
ashbury

1870
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:38,559
um there's some other stuff uh a point

1871
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,838
something to be on the brain something

1872
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,440
there are a few good ones that he had

1873
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,920
mandala mike someone just asked about

1874
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,159
that it was a similar era um totally

1875
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,280
totally underrated totally underrated

1876
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:51,679
for for the um european seat team i

1877
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,359
think he's still around too he probably

1878
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,199
and i honestly think too like just so

1879
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:57,199
people know it's not like

1880
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,798
i'm expecting if you run a bunch of

1881
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:00,558
except for the haze stuff you could find

1882
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:02,239
i'm sure some stuff in there but it's

1883
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,798
not like i'm expecting with some other

1884
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:06,639
shanti's lines that like you would find

1885
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,519
something that would just blow your head

1886
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,000
off

1887
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:11,759
completely and be as elite as some of

1888
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,679
the best stuff of today

1889
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,400
um but i do think

1890
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:19,358
that it tie like the genetics tie back

1891
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,639
to an era before all of the the

1892
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:21,598
bottlenecking

1893
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,239
yeah

1894
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,760
and so i think you could blend that

1895
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:27,358
you know i mean like straight up like

1896
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,119
imagine you took [ __ ] something like

1897
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:30,880
cookie and threw it on

1898
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,160
you know any number of his things mango

1899
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,519
haze yeah or nordle or whatever you know

1900
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,440
all of a sudden it's like i just it's

1901
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,519
just like so much different

1902
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,559
yeah you know it's not any of the same

1903
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:41,759
[ __ ]

1904
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,599
that you're you know because that's what

1905
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,000
happens these days is like it's all the

1906
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,880
same 40 or 50 cuts blended together in

1907
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,719
different ways yeah

1908
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,039
this is really what it boils down to la

1909
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:54,719
nina is a really nice drink

1910
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,160
i like la nina a bunch i have a bunch of

1911
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,598
la nina seeds

1912
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:02,558
uh and our buddy uh uh yo sami

1913
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:05,599
yeah uh talks about how they've crossed

1914
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:07,119
la nina to various old neville cuts and

1915
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,359
the results have been pretty phenomenal

1916
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,200
and they get sold in coffee shops and

1917
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,440
it's a it's a good thing

1918
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:16,879
yeah um la nina is supposed to be a

1919
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,838
white widow by uh mulan bit me madness

1920
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,318
um

1921
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:21,038
so it's it's like one of the few things

1922
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:24,639
that

1923
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,440
isn't you know uh sativa direct from sam

1924
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:28,159
yeah

1925
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,000
i guess you would say yeah

1926
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:32,000
yeah you know uh

1927
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,480
its origins are mysterious but both

1928
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,440
neville and shanti say that it came from

1929
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:39,280
you know this region of australia

1930
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,798
a lot of my friends out in australia

1931
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,798
that have been growing for a super long

1932
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,480
time outdoors there that are really

1933
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:46,000
familiar with uh

1934
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,719
the genetics that floated around there

1935
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,880
always go back to indians and thais they

1936
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,318
think everything is is indians and thais

1937
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,240
basically the bush weed that they have

1938
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,000
out there or some combination of indian

1939
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,038
and thai whereas like with our american

1940
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,079
stuff we have a lot of colombian and

1941
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,680
mexicans

1942
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,200
out there that was where they were

1943
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:02,960
sourcing that was what it was

1944
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,558
that was their import that was what they

1945
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,119
were getting free seed

1946
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,798
you know um and somebody is uh somebody

1947
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,920
and maybe or somebody mentioned the

1948
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,000
mango

1949
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,920
the mango haze from shanti is still a

1950
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
line that people find consistently good

1951
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,119
things in it oh yeah yeah it's one of my

1952
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,119
favorites um you know um and so it's

1953
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:23,838
it's one of those things that even today

1954

01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,439
show and he said he would but i think he

1968
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,640
just recently did a different show so

1969
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,919
we'll see what's going on i don't want

1970
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,759
to to

1971
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,679
you know overwhelm the dude so we'll see

1972
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:00,798
what's going on and somebody asked about

1973
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:03,039
yo sami um yo sami would be a phenomenal

1974
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,560
person to have on the show for sure he's

1975
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,679
got a wealth of knowledge he started

1976
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,480
growing for neville's crew in about

1977
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:10,719
94.95

1978
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:13,358
so he has a lot of first-hand experience

1979
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,359
with a lot of famous cuts yeah um but

1980
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,159
he's a pretty private person

1981
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,960
yeah

1982
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:22,079
and so i don't you know i don't know

1983
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:24,079
um you know he's been i asked him before

1984
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:25,838
um and you know it doesn't mean it

1985
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,000
couldn't happen but it hasn't

1986
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,519
yeah not yet we haven't had a hefty yet

1987
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,319
it'd be cool though i think he was he

1988
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,560
was very active on the on he was on the

1989
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:37,679
forums when i was yeah he was extremely

1990
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:40,000
active back then um and he posts on ig a

1991
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,838
bit and stuff but as far as like showing

1992
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,679
his face and talking and going through

1993
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,679
all that mess um

1994
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,679
you know and i i totally respect people

1995
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,239
for having issues with that yeah let's

1996
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,560
have hampi on

1997
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:55,519
i you know i mean i would sooner smash

1998
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:58,480
my nuts in a drawer than bring on hempy

1999
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,159
i'm sorry you know in all honesty

2000
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:02,879
for all the people watching the couple

2001
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:04,799
hundred or something that's here um

2002
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,119
hempy would be a great ad

2003
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,279
he might drive us nuts as far as

2004
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:12,000
entertainment

2005
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:14,238
you know uh he would probably be like

2006
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,960
watching a train wreck

2007
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:19,279
yeah i mean at least if he talked he

2008
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,119
wouldn't be typing and spelling because

2009
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:24,079
that's yes

2010
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:25,359
yeah he i thought i was i was a raging

2011
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,840
idiot

2012
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:30,000
even back then but hepe always had me

2013
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,840
beat he was the guy to be like bro can

2014
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,158
you calm down a little bit people are

2015
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,640
gonna hate you if you say that

2016
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,238
me saying that someone i mean i yes he's

2017
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,920
cry baby i agree i don't know what i

2018
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,839
don't know where it would go

2019
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,039
but the entertainment value of having

2020
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,079
hempy on

2021
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,679
tom hill you know we uh we tom hill

2022
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:49,920
communication

2023
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,000
tom hill it communicates with our crew

2024
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,600
he would also be a great ad

2025
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,880
um a lot of the old timers are are are

2026
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,600
very very

2027
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,600
their they're characters you know yeah

2028
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,120
other characters i mean these people

2029
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,280
people don't know we actually have an

2030
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,960
interview already recorded

2031
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,880
with um

2032
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,399
what's his name

2033
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,840
i mean do we really want to say his name

2034
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,000
i mean okay well i won't say his name

2035
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,600
but it was a person who was one of the

2036
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,520
original owners of one of the earliest

2037
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,679
hydra shops in the pacific northwest and

2038
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,480
it was highly recommended by

2039
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,560
greg greg because he knows a ton he was

2040
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:26,559
integral to the nord lights crew and all

2041
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,080
that stuff but

2042
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,360
we haven't released it because some of

2043
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,039
these dudes like they didn't really want

2044
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:33,279
to talk weed more than they wanted to

2045
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:34,719
talk about [ __ ] hookers so i'll i'll

2046
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:36,158
say this

2047
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:39,439
which is crazy

2048
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:42,000
the guy talked at such a rate

2049
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:44,559
that i think i got

2050
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,719
two sentences in in an hour and a half

2051
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,880
he made not so quite if you can believe

2052
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,198
it i couldn't talk and matt and i were

2053
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,000
texting each other and i would we did

2054
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:53,839
get

2055
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,719
i think one or two very interesting

2056
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,159
tidbits like half a second but it was

2057
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:00,079
literally like it's no exaggeration it

2058
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:01,519
was probably 30 seconds

2059
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:04,719
of weed talk

2060
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:07,120
and an hour and a half of the craziest

2061
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:10,000
hookers and and

2062
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,039
and stories from then and

2063
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,319
cops

2064
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,800
trump and his conspiracy theories and it

2065
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,479
was it was i i mean it was we may

2066
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,400
release it one day just because he was

2067
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,639
very excited for us to release it so why

2068
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,879
you know he was i don't know

2069
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,920
we chose to sort of protect him

2070
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,679
um by not releasing it because you know

2071
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,440
it was it was the thing where it was

2072
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,800
like we were sort of interested in weed

2073
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:34,719
history

2074
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,199
and he was sort of interested in telling

2075
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,119
us all the wild tales of his youth

2076
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:40,879
yeah i think he i think he had a

2077
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:42,319
different uh opinion like he thought

2078
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,359
maybe we were interviewing about his

2079
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:47,519
life as opposed to weed and the the his

2080
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:48,880
relation to weed i mean but it was also

2081
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,400
kind of like even when you would try to

2082
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,760
steer him in the direction of talking

2083
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,679
more about weed

2084
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,520
he would just mention it as a side and

2085
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,319
then get right back to something super

2086
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:01,120
kooky yeah i mean the dude was hella

2087
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:04,158
cool he was [ __ ] hilarious so maybe

2088
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:06,079
we will you know like i i mean i think

2089
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:07,679
now that we're put past the trump era

2090
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:09,920
and a lot of that

2091
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,158
everybody's mad stuff i think maybe we

2092
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,760
could release it now it wouldn't be as

2093
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:15,920
or maybe it would be a worse time to do

2094
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,039
it i don't know i mean i don't know dude

2095
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,319
it just it it goes to show that we will

2096
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:23,039
have a poll

2097
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:25,119
you can be very important in music or

2098
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:26,238
weed or art or this or that or whatever

2099
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:28,640
it might be

2100
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:31,439
and outside of that you can be a human

2101
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:33,360
with a wide variety of views

2102
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:34,639
you know uh and a lot of us have some

2103
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:36,399
illnesses

2104
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,400
you know one kind or another like

2105
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:39,839
there's something there's something odd

2106
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:41,599
about weed people

2107
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,319
you know um

2108
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,920
and uh but i mean it was like it's

2109
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,119
it there's parts of it that are pretty

2110
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,279
risque

2111
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:52,158
too yeah like you know i say some [ __ ]

2112
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:54,880
up [ __ ] and i say some off the wall

2113
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:56,399
homoerotic things even and this some of

2114
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,480
this [ __ ] i was like god i don't know if

2115
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,639
we can put that out there yeah it was it

2116
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:03,839
was definitely r-rated at certain

2117
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,119
aspects of it you know um which is fine

2118
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,880
you know but that's that's the thing

2119
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:08,319
it's like you know there's an aspect

2120
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,000
where some of these old-timers that are

2121
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,599
that were super involved can be tough

2122
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,439
interviews because

2123
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,960
they're they were kooky people when they

2124
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,279
were young

2125
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,880
yeah and now they're old kooky people

2126
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:20,639
yeah

2127
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,880
you know and i don't want him to get

2128
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,119
canceled over or anything [ __ ] crazy

2129
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,719
because that can happen you know like

2130
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,640
if people think that he said something

2131
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,480
too extreme but

2132
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,960
i think it's fun and like the duke is an

2133
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,639
important part of that pacific northwest

2134
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,000
history there's no doubt about that he

2135
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,239
was there i mean

2136
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,880
he he even was a part of operation green

2137
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:42,639
merchant and and got rid of it he was

2138
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:45,359
definitely involved in tons of [ __ ]

2139
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,119
getting him to talk about any specifics

2140
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,599
yeah was tough

2141
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:51,760
yeah you know he just he

2142
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,960
i mean he was basically like we were the

2143
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,640
audience

2144
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,880
yeah oh yeah and it was his we weren't

2145
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,760

2146
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,400

2148
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:05,519
really weird uh

2149
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,119
where i try to keep a straight face and

2150

somebody said eddie left was a wild

2154
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:15,039
interview eddie left well i mean i've

2155
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:16,799
talked about it before he was a pretty

2156
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:19,198
he was a decent friend of mine

2157
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,600
um you know he was uh he had huge balls

2158
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:24,079
and he was also a massive egomaniac

2159
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,880
yeah you know people are complicated you

2160
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:29,920
know we have we have pluses and minuses

2161
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,400
um you know uh neville was complicated

2162
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,520
yeah you know neville was uh you know i

2163
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:35,039
mean

2164
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,600
you know neville had addictions and

2165
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,760
neville had issues and you know and all

2166
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,320
that type of stuff but he also had huge

2167
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,480
balls you'd be hard pressed to find like

2168
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:46,880
to get a crowd of a bunch of seed makers

2169
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:49,359
together and find more than 10 people

2170
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,079
that aren't ex junkies like we are all

2171
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,839
[ __ ] up most of us i'm one of the ten

2172
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:55,359
yeah i know you're one of the very few

2173
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,840
one of them

2174
01:15:55,359 --> 01:16:00,399
but that was uh you can you can thank uh

2175
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,079
dead tour for that yeah yeah because i

2176
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:04,559
got i got to see what even like

2177
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,399
successful junkies looked like yeah and

2178
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,800
i was like whoa

2179
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,559
yeah that's intense being a functional

2180
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,440
junkie is a real thing

2181
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,120
i mean

2182
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:14,799
in the senate what i mean by functional

2183
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:16,880
is like the dude that i was traveling

2184
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,039
with he just made so much money

2185
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,039
yeah that he never had to do any of this

2186
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:23,198
like the [ __ ] that people like he he

2187
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,198
made plenty of money you could easily

2188
01:16:23,198 --> 01:16:26,719
afford his habit so you just got to see

2189
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:27,919
it from the perspective of like what

2190
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,840
does it do to you

2191
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,000
yeah he didn't really have to hustle or

2192
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,760
lie or cheat or this or that or anything

2193
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,520
like that that wasn't his thing

2194
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,520
yeah you know but when he ran out

2195
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:42,719
that [ __ ] hurts that [ __ ] hurts

2196
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,159
you know painful painful feeling that's

2197
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,679
uh

2198
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,639
and the amount and the crazy part about

2199
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,640
it is is that to go from like flopping

2200
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,000
like a fish and sweating and vomiting

2201
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,520
and pooping and

2202
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,600
you know fever and all this different

2203
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,280
stuff and then somebody shows up and

2204
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,600
takes care of them

2205
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,920
and he's like let's get some tacos yeah

2206
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,280
five minutes later oh he pops out he's

2207
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,079
like i'm gonna wash my face let's go get

2208
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:08,719
some food yeah and he just spent two

2209
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:11,679
hours in the hotel like in in you know

2210
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,600
unbelievable misery yeah

2211
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,679
that [ __ ] sucks and it's for real yeah

2212
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,039
but i mean it's that's it's also true

2213
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:19,119
that a lot of that addiction and stuff

2214
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:22,158
was super common up in mendo and

2215
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:23,679
humboldt and all that because it's dark

2216
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:25,279
and rainy in the winter

2217
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,880
yeah and especially back in the day

2218
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:30,000
people got lonely

2219
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,840
you know and they had a lot of money

2220
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,119
because that you know we'd sold for a

2221
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,119
lot back then

2222
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,198
so there was a lot of people that would

2223
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,880
started out as back to the landers and

2224
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:41,279
ended up you know

2225
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,119
addicted to opiates or cocaine or this

2226
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:44,800
or that or whatever else because they

2227
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,119
were bored and winter

2228
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,119
yeah i mean even when i was i started my

2229
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:51,359
career as a [ __ ] up

2230
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:53,519
like everybody during that time wasn't

2231
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:55,679
just selling weed at least out of our

2232
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,800
group nobody was just selling we like

2233
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,399
because it was this you were gonna get

2234
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,079
the same charges didn't really [ __ ]

2235
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,519
matter if you were selling weed you

2236
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:03,439
might as well be selling everything

2237
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,480
because other stuff made more money than

2238
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,879
we so it was it was just it was around

2239
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:10,559
it was common during that time but

2240
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,560
what's interesting about that is not not

2241
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,920
to dis neville on it or anything like

2242
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,920
that but

2243
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,000
what's weird is that neville being a

2244
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,600
hardcore junkie

2245
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,399
is actually what brought him to

2246
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,280
amsterdam and they had the seed and he

2247
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:27,359
was part dutch and they had part of you

2248
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,158
know they had very liberal policies over

2249
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:30,960
there and they got extremely clean dope

2250
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:33,759
from

2251
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,679
from asia uh traditionally and so he

2252
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,760
went there to be a junkie

2253
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,880
yep and then kind of fell into the seed

2254
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,880
game

2255
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,159
you know while there so it's it's kind

2256
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,079
of like without

2257
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:44,879
without heroin

2258
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:46,559
uh

2259
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,000
a lot of the things that we talk about

2260
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,159
don't exist

2261
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,880
yeah i think it was clyde clyde that

2262
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:56,559
told me that neville got

2263
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,079
um he he was

2264
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,480
the dutch government had a program for

2265
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:02,640
people to get off heroin they would help

2266
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:04,799
them with the trade and neville was

2267
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:08,880
breeding exotic birdseed and they gave

2268
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,880
him money to start the bank that way

2269
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,560
uh to get off dope and uh claim that he

2270
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:16,479
was breeding more nutritious

2271
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,560

01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:25,279
it to start the seed bank uh which is

2276

you know the afghanistan trip yeah the

2290
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:53,519
i'm sorry the afghanistan trip and so a

2291
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:56,079
lot of the pictures like in neville's

2292
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,320
first catalog of him holding hash

2293
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,559
and him hanging out and smoking with uh

2294
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,439
with you know the afghans and stuff that

2295
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,400
was all his uh his photographer clyde

2296
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:05,759
and

2297
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,759
he's talked about doing an interview

2298
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,079
with us but he also has

2299
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,920
some kind of movie deal

2300
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,479
thing with that specific story of the

2301
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,679
afghanistan trip so he can't legally

2302
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:18,158
tell it

2303
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:20,399
for some reason like on a podcast it's

2304
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:21,759
interesting in the sense that um you

2305
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:23,198
know uh

2306
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,880
maybe i should tell this because it's

2307
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:25,759
kind of funny um but

2308
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,840
sam

2309
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,000
skunk man and neville both went to

2310
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,679
afghanistan at different times and they

2311
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,399
both have some pretty crazy stories

2312
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,800
about it and sam has this funny story

2313
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:38,799
about trying to get seeds from some of

2314
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,719
these muhajideen and some of these

2315
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,039
fighters and stuff

2316
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:46,960
and there's this warlord that looked at

2317
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:50,399
him and basically told him that uh flour

2318
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,399
is for slaves and women

2319
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:56,238
and real men smoked hash and so was he a

2320
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,279
slave or a woman

2321
01:20:56,238 --> 01:20:59,678
and

2322
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,759
sam got and sam got out of it by telling

2323
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,359
him he had no interest

2324
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,039
in the flower

2325
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:07,039
that he agreed it was for slaves and

2326
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:09,039
women but he wanted the seeds to be able

2327
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:11,760
to grow to make his own hashish in

2328
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:14,880
america brilliant and so

2329
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,719
the afghan warlord decided that was fair

2330
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,480
yeah and made him smoke a bunch of hash

2331
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:21,119
with him to prove that he wasn't a [ __ ]

2332
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:23,519
essentially yeah you know

2333
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:25,279
um and uh

2334
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,440
yeah and so and then you know neville

2335
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:29,039
neville has a story and and clyde has

2336
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:31,039
backed it up of going over there and

2337
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:33,519
having to negotiate with literal

2338
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:34,639
muajidine warlords

2339
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,560
and you know they had a bunch of

2340
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:38,880
american money and were they going to

2341
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:41,120
get killed are they going to get robbed

2342
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,880
sound the the story coming from from

2343
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,559
clyde and neville

2344
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,560
that is one of the best stories ever

2345
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,719
especially the one that wasn't published

2346
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,639
there's one that's out there that he's

2347
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,480
that is part of the movie script that

2348
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,560
people have seen but he told me the

2349
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:56,559
stuff that wasn't in that and it sounds

2350
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,400
like a [ __ ] nightmare like he was

2351
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,639
overdosed dying

2352
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,719
inside of this little tiny hut and he

2353
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:05,279
had people trying to get they were

2354
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:06,480
trying to get in to kill them

2355
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:07,599
like they wanted to kill them because

2356
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:09,519
they thought they were americans with

2357
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,480
money so they wanted to [ __ ] kill

2358
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,360
them

2359
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:13,439
so

2360
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:15,279
this is a funny story about that right

2361
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:16,638
is that

2362
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:18,559
in a weird way

2363
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,159
uh when we just talked about how without

2364
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,440
heroin neville ever would have been to

2365
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:22,719
amsterdam

2366
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:25,839
when neville went over there to get

2367
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:28,560
seeds uh the afghanistan people were

2368
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,159
very worried about cia and d and these

2369
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,840
kind of groups and stuff and so they

2370
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,399
wanted to make sure

2371
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,600
that he wasn't a european spy

2372
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:39,519
yeah right and so in order to prove that

2373
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,679
him and clyde had to shoot heroin

2374
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,840
because they because they were like

2375
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,359
if you're not you know you're gonna if

2376
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,440
you want these seeds if you want this

2377
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,359
work if you don't want us to kill you

2378
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:51,439
you have to prove that you're not and i

2379
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:53,679
know that an agent would never

2380
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:55,759
yeah yeah that is so they both they both

2381
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,199
had to shoot heroin in order in order

2382
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,280
and you know they were both they both

2383
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:02,799
partied or whatever on that stuff but

2384
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:05,039
clyde ode yeah clyde decided to die

2385
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,000
you know and so then he od in a [ __ ]

2386
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:10,560
hut in some you know

2387
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,079
ancient village or whatever and had yeah

2388
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,760
you know and it was it was it wasn't

2389
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:14,960
like there was some like modern hospital

2390
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,760
nearby

2391
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,600
so he od'd on afghanistan on afghan

2392
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,360
heroin neville didn't

2393
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,840
and they were like okay well these guys

2394
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:25,119
shoot up they made them shoot up in

2395
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,039
front of them

2396
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,639
and actually use needles and the whole

2397
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,880
bit you know

2398
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,679
uh and that's how he got the seeds

2399
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,319
yeah

2400
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:36,719
and then they tried to kill them yeah

2401
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:38,238
and then they they tried to kill them i

2402
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,439
would have died i mean you know i

2403
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:40,399
couldn't have done it you know i didn't

2404
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:42,799
have any

2405
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:45,119
uh i would od for sure

2406
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,960
yeah because i have zero

2407
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:49,039
zero tolerance you know but i probably

2408
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,279
would have just been right there with

2409
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:54,079
neville but same story i mean sam didn't

2410
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:55,599
have to do drugs but sam basically like

2411
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:57,359
you know the way he tells the story or

2412
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,360
whatever it's like you know

2413
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:01,359
uh an afghan warlord was considering

2414
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:04,238
turning him into his [ __ ]

2415
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:06,479
yeah that's gotta suck you know like

2416
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:08,158
maybe you know maybe

2417
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:09,039
and so yeah so

2418
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:12,158
those

2419
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:14,639
there's definitely some indiana jones

2420
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:17,839
aspects to those like uh

2421
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:19,359
yeah going into war zones after seats

2422
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,480
we need to have bodhi come on and tell

2423
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:24,639
some of his indian trips

2424
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:26,479
the in season one we wanted to do we

2425
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:29,039
wanted we wanted to do a hippie hashish

2426
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,879
trail thing oh yeah yeah remember and we

2427
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,079
wanted to put more time and effort into

2428
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,359
building it out because it's kind of a

2429
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:35,119
long story

2430
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,279
uh and bodhi agreed to do it and it's

2431
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:39,920
just kind of gotten back burnered yeah

2432
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:42,158
but it would probably be a great episode

2433
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:45,199
uh because bodhi has the experience of

2434
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,638
traveling and matt and i have a bunch

2435
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:48,559
and some friends have a bunch of

2436
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:50,159
documents and posters and different

2437
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,320
things from that era

2438
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:55,599
yeah yeah uh we could always get joe

2439
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:57,679
petrie if we wanted to go

2440
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,520
we could get the king of nepal on holy

2441
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,119
[ __ ] that would probably be as off the

2442
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,840
rails as hempy or

2443
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:07,439
he did a show with um with the blue lies

2444
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,960
the other day he did oh yes yes

2445
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,638
likely duo

2446
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,119
but there was there was you know a lot

2447
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:15,840
of the early afghans and stuff like that

2448
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:18,000
because all the sativas that people have

2449
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,760
in america basically came with free

2450
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,920
seeds with the kilos

2451
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,520
yeah but the hashish didn't come with

2452
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,600
free seeds so

2453
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,320
sam and nev a bunch of these people had

2454
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:31,360
to travel the hippie hashish trail

2455
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:34,479
and go find them and bring it back

2456
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:36,559
yeah you know um mel frank says that the

2457
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:39,839
grower that he got the afghani one seeds

2458
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:42,320
from in the bay had done that yeah

2459
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:44,000
you know um supposedly the big bud is

2460
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:46,000
from that

2461
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,800
you know uh supposedly the steve murphy

2462
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,238
that started the nl1 or the nl lines is

2463
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,320
all from that

2464
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:54,479
yeah is all from different people going

2465
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:56,479
over to amsterd going over to you know

2466
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:59,198
afghanistan

2467
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:01,919
it was a female that went and it was gut

2468
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:03,359
and the the murphy afghanis actually

2469
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,079
they don't know if it was afghanistan or

2470
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:08,559
pakistan but it was a girl that brought

2471
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:10,639
it back young lady

2472
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,400
oh my gosh what do i think i don't know

2473
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,600
if i can answer that one

2474
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:15,119
um

2475
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,199
you know what do i think of the what do

2476
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,399
i think of the the burner and the bodhi

2477
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:21,439
collab

2478
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:23,519
um i'll just say this uh bodhi's a good

2479
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:24,719
friend and he's done a bunch of very

2480
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,159
cool work

2481
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,000
and there's a lot of people trying to

2482
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:29,359
figure out how to survive in this weird

2483
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,238
new world

2484
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:31,519
yeah

2485
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,119
it's not easy

2486
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,360
uh and

2487
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:37,439
um cookies and burner and all those

2488
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:40,238
people aren't breeders

2489
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,439
and they're definitely looking to keep

2490
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:42,559
they don't know where to go and they

2491
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:44,638
need help

2492
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,520
yeah and they have to bring in outside

2493
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,840
help

2494
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:50,560
um because they've had kind of their new

2495
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,719
new is sort of the same same

2496
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,560
that they've had forever now

2497
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,719
and they don't know where to go with it

2498
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,480
um and it's sort of irrelevant for

2499
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:00,719
cookie to have new [ __ ] because it's

2500
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:02,158
like now they're a store and clothing

2501
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,279
brand and they're just they're just

2502
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:09,119
established yeah if all they had was

2503
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:11,759
that one cookie explosion in 09 to 12

2504
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:14,079
that produced the og kbb and the animal

2505
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,000
and this and that and led to all this

2506
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:17,760
other [ __ ]

2507
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,439
you know but burner's a salesman he's a

2508
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,480
rapper

2509
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:22,638
you know they're going to need to

2510
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,000
partner with real weed people

2511
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:26,239
yeah

2512
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,119
you know and bodhi's not a scumbag

2513
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:30,879
no he's a very nice guy and i i i'm

2514
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:32,399
stoked about it because i think it's

2515
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,039
it's the way to influence

2516
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:37,679
the rest of the the country as it were

2517
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:40,319
that listen to people like cookies you

2518
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:42,880
can finally push them into like better

2519
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:45,119
weed and body knows good weed

2520
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,039
and he's a good person

2521
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:48,719
with that said if they [ __ ] if he

2522
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:50,639
gets [ __ ] in this hole

2523
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,800
yeah anyway i mean look what matt is

2524
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,600
basically saying is that there's a

2525
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,679
chance to stand outside and throw

2526
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,440
molotov cocktails at every rich

2527
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:00,800
established group that's trying to take

2528
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:02,799
over weed

2529
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,440
or you can try to work with them or work

2530
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:08,239
within their structure and move them in

2531
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:11,039
a different direction yeah and there's

2532
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:13,119
arguments to be made on both sides

2533
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:16,560
not every group is monolithic but

2534
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:18,960
whether we like it or not uh you know

2535
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,719
rich rich investor kids are taking over

2536
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,600
weed in california

2537
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,920
yeah

2538
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,679
you know and if you if you're not

2539
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,440
willing to work with rich investors you

2540
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,359
don't have a chance you don't have a

2541
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:31,039
chance in hell you're going to end up

2542
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:32,880
you know on friday nights telling

2543
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,158
[ __ ] stupid history stories is what's

2544
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,000
going to happen

2545
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:37,279
well i mean you know

2546
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,719
this this is fine because this is

2547
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:40,840
actually a hobby for me and i enjoy

2548
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,880
bullshitting and i don't care if i make

2549
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:45,920
money but

2550
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,279
you know i'll say this too

2551
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,960
you know we talked about it before when

2552
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:49,920
i was doing the superdog project 20

2553
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,800
years ago

2554
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,920
there was no market for american seed

2555
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,000
sales

2556
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,399
yeah there was almost no way to get a

2557
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,719
hold of people to sell seeds to them if

2558
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,559
you they were interested in your seats

2559
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,319
yeah it was just too risky instagram in

2560
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,480
the last 10 years

2561
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:08,479
has created an environment where all

2562
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,479
these [ __ ] can start breeding

2563
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:12,079
and selling direct to the public and

2564
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,000
they were buying seeds and selling those

2565
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,920
seeds and there was there's been an

2566
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,319
explosion of breeding

2567
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,399
right yes and all that breeding was

2568
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,880
based on a bunch of small and

2569
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:25,279
medium-sized farmers and thousands of

2570
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:27,279
indoors and thousands of small outdoors

2571
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:29,519
growing weed and pushing it through the

2572
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,519
traditional and the dispensary market

2573
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,280
yeah well that's all been cut off now

2574
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,600
and it's all a bunch of corporations

2575
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:37,599
pushing with the dispensary market

2576
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,760
the traditional market is trashed and

2577
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,280
there's not very much money in it and so

2578
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,800
in order to sell a bunch of beans and

2579
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:44,880
have phenol hunting and do a bunch of

2580
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,920
that stuff growers need to be making

2581
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,679
money

2582
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,600
yeah they need to be having disposable

2583
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:51,600
income to go to these things and buy a

2584
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,360
bunch of seed and look through it and

2585
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,360
have a bunch of it not work out and have

2586
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,839
one or two things they find they like

2587
01:29:55,359 --> 01:30:00,238
yep you know and so the dynamics of seed

2588
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,560
making has changed dramatically

2589
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,158
yeah um i'm actually matt and i chat

2590
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:08,000
about this i'm actually more worried

2591
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:09,039
about diversity than i was before

2592
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,238
you know

2593
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:14,319
uh legalization has been so far bad for

2594
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,799
diversity yeah

2595
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,719
you know um and the way that they've set

2596
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,880
things up you would think that you could

2597
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,960
really open it up but you can't

2598
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,159
uh they make it very narrow how to make

2599
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,079
money

2600
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,679
yeah you know and what to try and where

2601
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:29,359
to get it most people have to get stuff

2602
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,800
from nurseries and so if the nursery

2603
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:32,960
doesn't want to make a commercial amount

2604
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,880
of clones of it you can't even buy it

2605
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,960
yeah they've made a lot of rules on a

2606
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,359
lot of regulations that you know it's

2607
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:41,279
not as easy like in the 215 era

2608
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,198
[ __ ] could go to emerald cup or

2609
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,198
high times or whatever and go see matt

2610
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:47,759
and go see bodie and go see swamp boys

2611
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:50,238
or go see whoever and buy packs of beans

2612
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,159
and this is my next this is my next 50

2613
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:54,559
this is my next 25.

2614
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:56,559
yeah i'm growing these from seed outdoor

2615
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,480
next year

2616
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,000
yeah that's gone and then all they

2617
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:02,879
needed to do to do that was money in

2618
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,158
their pocket and the desire yeah

2619
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,520
you know

2620
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:07,839
and now

2621
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:10,080
now what do you do with all that

2622
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:13,119
yeah that's just gone now now shit's

2623
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:16,399
gone and so it's it's hard you know um

2624
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:18,319
and uh and on all that and so a lot of

2625
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,359
that diversity is gone you could look at

2626
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:23,279
the 215 era when we first got on ig

2627
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:25,679
really and

2628
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,519
how many hundreds and hundreds of small

2629
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,760
medical gardens would you see people

2630
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,159
posting [ __ ] that were growing 25 or 50

2631
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:34,560
or 99 plants yeah

2632
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:34,559
tons

2633
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:38,719
different

2634
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:40,000
and now it's not the case and so you

2635
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:41,840
know so none of you get to talk [ __ ]

2636
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,079
about bodhi or i'll [ __ ]

2637
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,719
deal with all you guys but you know seed

2638
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:48,800
makers like matt or like bodhi or like

2639
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:50,399
see any any of them everyone's got to

2640
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,880
figure out

2641
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:55,198
what they're going to do to survive

2642
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,279
because the market has changed and the

2643
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:58,719
buyers have changed and the pressures

2644
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:00,719
have changed

2645
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,239
and how do you fit in

2646
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:04,000
yeah

2647
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:06,158
i know he changes i hope he changes

2648
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,639
things and i hope i hope that he's one

2649
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:10,879
of the avenues that

2650
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:12,560
opens a lot of a lot of smokers minds to

2651
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,920
[ __ ] more than cookies and og if

2652
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,199
someone's got to do it someone has to

2653
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,480
break that mold

2654
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:19,919
and i i hope you know and there's

2655
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:21,839
there's an aspect to it where it's like

2656
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,679
you know the the the

2657
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,800
the bad part about it for anybody that's

2658
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,480
gonna [ __ ]

2659
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,800
oh it would be

2660
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:30,399
bodhi decided to save his family by

2661
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,279
joining the borg

2662
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:33,519
yeah

2663
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:35,279
the good part of it would be

2664
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,040
burner can promote the [ __ ] out of

2665
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:39,279
crappy weed

2666
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:41,039
so what happens if bodhi makes them

2667
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:43,359
improve their thing and he's promoting

2668
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,960
the crap out of much better weed yeah

2669
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:47,198
and then people end up smoking much

2670
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,039
better weed and then we'll make money

2671
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:50,960
off much better weed and then there's a

2672
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:53,119
connoisseur market that doesn't exist

2673
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,840
right right now currently

2674
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:56,800
yeah because you know it's like i

2675
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,400
so

2676
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,400
you know it there's an aspect to it

2677
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:02,399
where it's like people can throw stones

2678
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:03,279
from outside but it's not that easy of a

2679
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:05,279
thing

2680
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:07,359
where does the seed breeder go you know

2681
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:10,319
you can't even back in the day

2682
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:12,000
how many how many gray area cups and you

2683
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:14,000
know not gray area coffee shop but how

2684
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,679
many cup how many events would you go to

2685
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,600
a year

2686
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,679
yeah yeah you could be you could be a

2687
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,600
seed breeder and you could be at one or

2688
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:22,480
two events a month selling seeds to the

2689
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,199
public

2690
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,279
yeah

2691
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:27,039
easy yeah during some years you could

2692
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:28,719
during some years you know and and you

2693
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:30,079
would there would be a top dog booth and

2694
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:32,158
there would be a riot booth and there

2695
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:33,840
would be a csi booth and there would be

2696
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:35,439
i remember the first year that bodhi was

2697
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,520
at emerald cup

2698
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:39,359
right yeah like i didn't even get to

2699
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,360
talk to him till sunday because i felt

2700
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:44,559
bad because there was literally like a

2701
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:48,238
80 yard line yeah in front of his booth

2702
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:50,480
friday and saturday all day long it was

2703
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:51,919
like a mad house there was thousands of

2704
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:54,000
people with money in their pocket that

2705
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,639
were gonna buy seeds from bodhi and talk

2706
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,158
to him it was a beautiful time yeah now

2707
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,800
you can't do that because he's not

2708
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:02,238
licensed he's not registered it's not

2709
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,719
sold through whatever he doesn't have a

2710
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:06,879
dispensary license he doesn't have a he

2711
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:08,239
doesn't have all the [ __ ] pieces of

2712
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,159
paper that allow you to just walk up and

2713
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:11,359
talk to him yeah

2714
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:14,158
yeah

2715
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:16,158
so that's hard so that you've the the

2716
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:19,119
rules have cut off a lot of these

2717
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:21,839
independent types from even seeing you

2718
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:23,279
you know yeah and talking to you i mean

2719
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,039
you know it would be funny like when we

2720
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,719
would go to emerald cup and stuff part

2721
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:29,840
of the reason why we started doing these

2722
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,960
canola candle illuminati parties is

2723
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,480
because

2724
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,480
none of the br none of the friends got

2725
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:36,158
to talk to each other

2726
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:38,479
yeah yeah because they're all busy

2727
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:41,439
working their booth all day long because

2728
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:43,118
the customer wants to talk to them

2729
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:44,559
to make the purchase

2730
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:45,359
yeah and you don't want to be a rude

2731
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,960
[ __ ]

2732
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,759
and so we started throwing these like

2733
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,679
nighttime events you know uh every night

2734
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,039
that every night that had happened at

2735
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,560
the emerald cup

2736
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:56,079
so that all the people after getting

2737
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,840
done working they could just go [ __ ]

2738
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:59,279
with their friends yeah i wanted to see

2739
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,800
who the best kisser was but he wanted to

2740
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:02,800
see his friends i wanted to see my

2741
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,639
friends you know and so you know we

2742
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,159
rented beautiful houses and we cooked

2743
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,440
out and you know we had bitter on the

2744
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:10,079
grill we had a bunch of really good

2745
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:12,319
friends and tons of people would come

2746
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:13,679
you know tons of tons of breeders tons

2747
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:16,319
of movers and shakers and after they

2748
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,760
were done talking all day to customers

2749
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,319
they wanted to hang out with people like

2750
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,520
them and shoot the [ __ ] yeah

2751
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:22,719
because before it's like you're going to

2752
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,520
go up and you're going to try to talk to

2753
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:27,359
bodhi or csi or something on on friday

2754
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,400
at 3 o'clock

2755
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,839
there's six people deep and 50 yards

2756
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:32,879
long waiting to talk

2757
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,199
yeah

2758
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:37,440
yeah those are stressful times too like

2759
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:39,279
yeah when you're talking to a new person

2760
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:41,279
every five minutes it's hard to remember

2761
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:43,198
[ __ ] and a lot of those companies made

2762
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:45,519
bank off renting booths

2763
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:47,519
yeah yeah so you know a lot of people

2764
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:49,199
output thousands of dollars and hired

2765
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,040
friends to help them run the booth and

2766
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:52,638
move things and stuff and so there's a

2767
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:53,439
cost to it so you want to let people

2768
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:55,520
work

2769
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:57,678
yeah you want to let people hand you

2770
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,000
know shake hands and shoot the [ __ ] and

2771
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,679
tell and talk about their strains and

2772
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,039
you know sell as much of their stuff to

2773
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:06,079
the public as they could yeah

2774
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:07,920
you know

2775
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:09,679
um i mean now this year i think at

2776
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,399
emerald cup they finally did this thing

2777
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:12,079
where

2778
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:13,599
there was like a little like legacy

2779
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:15,600
grower section

2780
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,360
i heard you know where you know you

2781
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,800
could uh you could go see people where

2782
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:19,839
they could have weed where it wasn't

2783
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,920
like it didn't have to be through a

2784
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:27,440
dispensary yeah through a distro because

2785
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,800
essentially the 215 era cups were like

2786
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:29,839
swap meets

2787
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,279

2788
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,039
they were two we didn't know we didn't

2789
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:34,960
know how good we had it with two fish oh

2790
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:36,319
no people could go and sell seed and

2791
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,679
they could sell weed and they could sell

2792
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:39,439
dabs and they could sell this and they

2793
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,880
could sell t-shirts and they could just

2794
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:42,719
rent a booth

2795
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:46,000

but it was cool it was like essentially

2828
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:53,679
what we tried to do is like when when

2829

cannabis got super legal we tried to

2830
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:57,600
have like an old school harvest festival

2831
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,639
party where the tables were just covered

2832
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,560
in weed

2833
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,159
and jars of all different kinds and

2834
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:04,000
people could just roll joints and take

2835
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:05,599
bong hits and shoot the [ __ ] and this is

2836
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,800
what i brought and this is what you have

2837
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,880
you know

2838
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,679
um and so uh

2839
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,199
you know it it eventually the last year

2840
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,319
so we did that i don't think we went to

2841
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:16,719
the cup

2842
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,479
no no we just waited for all the people

2843
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,800
we wanted to see to come and party and

2844
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:22,718
hang out that first year i went i went

2845
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,920
to the cup and i remember i got sick i

2846
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,920
was like there are too many [ __ ]

2847
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:28,000
people here i'm gonna go back

2848
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,679
and uh yeah but that was what was really

2849
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,840
cool about a lot of those old events was

2850
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,719
it was organized chaos

2851
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,319
yeah

2852
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,639
and now the more rules that they put

2853
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:38,880
into place was 64 it sort of cut off the

2854
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:40,639
customers from being able to go

2855
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,920
i mean especially like emerald cup in

2856
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:43,520
december

2857
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,199
there would be so many people that would

2858
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,400
show up with money in their pocket from

2859
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:49,039
their outdoor

2860
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:52,399
yep ready to buy seeds to fino hunt for

2861
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,920
the next outdoor yep and that was that

2862
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:56,879
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

2863
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,800
dollars were spent on just that oh yeah

2864
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,960
easy lots of money

2865
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,600
you know was was was spread out and so

2866
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:06,158
now one year it was gone that was

2867
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,079
done so now there's now the whole market

2868
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:10,799
but now not only the seed the seed

2869
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:12,399
makers ability to get in front of people

2870
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,560
right and to build their

2871
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:17,279
brand or whatever you know yeah or like

2872
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,800
the the seed maker's ability to sell or

2873
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:20,479
even the people that would normally buy

2874
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,079
their seeds how little they're getting

2875
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,479
for weed right now

2876
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:27,760
yeah really puts a lot of pressure on

2877
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:29,198
seed makers yeah yeah it's a different

2878
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,960
time dude you know they have they're

2879
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:34,319
going to have to adapt how they're doing

2880
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,719
things and you know we'll see who sticks

2881
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,158
