his balls over his hair it's brutal it

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,280
is I mean yeah you know facial

31
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,140
expressions random stuff you don't even

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,760
think of they pick up on and all of a

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,340
sudden it's a meme or something so yeah

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,140
the verbal tics sure yeah the verbal

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,020
tics it's hard being a public speaker

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,579
yeah it's not easy you know you don't

37
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:24,959
really realize it until you listen to

38
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,879
yourself and then you're like oh man

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,679
wait yeah wait until you're staring at

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,739
yourself and a long selfie for an hour

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,020
it's really it's really interesting yeah

42
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,118
anyone anyone that knows me in real life

43
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,500
knows that I'm not like a big I kind of

44
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,239
have like a bit I'm known for like my

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,978
death stare I'm like I look I look

46
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,359
friendly when I'm smiling but I have a

47
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,340
death stare a lot of the time so it

48
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,500
doesn't translate well over over uh

49
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,140
phones sometimes too

50
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,819
well we're super glad to have you

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,799
um I wanted to start out talking a

52
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,078
little bit about your your early

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,240
introduction into the import scene in

54
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,438
candidate let's start there um what was

55
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,118
it like what kind of stuff were you

56
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,298
seeing um and what years are we talking

57
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,299
about

58
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
um yeah so I guess now that I think of

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,799
it I actually my original start was

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,318
actually a weird start it was actually

61
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,060
one of my when I first started was

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,280
exposed to it it was actually from a

63
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,739
friend when I'm a just a guy from down

64
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,900
the Street's mom who was we found out

65
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,120
later was like a full-on like closet

66
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,060
grower she was kind of like this hippie

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,800
lady we used to it was her boyfriend I

68
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,780
actually got us like started smoking

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,340
weed and then we'd always just Jack her

70
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,780
weed out of her bedside table and there

71
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,580
was a big story that went with it about

72
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,140
where it was it was this exotic import

73
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,760
and it turned out afterwards it was just

74
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,919
she was literally one of the first

75
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,598
Growers around our area

76
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,579
um growing it all in the backyard right

77
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,560
in front of us we had no idea so but

78
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,840
basically that so my first start was was

79
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,878
homegrown and then but there really

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,519
wasn't much weed going around back then

81
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,439
it was really all import and I don't

82
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,300
remember the years ago I started really

83
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,639
I started smoking when I was like 14 so

84
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,540
it's probably like 86 or something like

85
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,299
that

86
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,818
and yeah like for basically in Canada

87
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,180
until like you got a little bit of

88
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:08,699
domestic stuff but pretty much from

89
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,040
those mid like mid 80s until

90
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,899
uh it was like early 90s there wasn't

91
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,639
much domestic at all because we didn't

92
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,019
get any like that there was not a lot of

93
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,279
outdoor and stuff it was just the

94
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,080
occasional indoor and you couldn't even

95
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
really sell it it was you basically had

96
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,459
to like I can totally remember people

97
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,318
growing indoor and pressing it into

98
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,479
bricks and selling it because that was

99
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,098
the only way you could actually

100
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,579
um sell it like you couldn't people

101
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:34,979
wouldn't buy it or

102
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,180
uh part of me did they not recognize it

103
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,919
as cannabis because it looks so

104
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,080
different not compressed or what was the

105
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,119
reason uh well it was green was one

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,519
thing and and the you know back then it

107
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,439
was just people didn't recognize that it

108
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,819
was possible to grow good wheat they

109
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,259
thought it was really it had to be

110
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,399
important and keep in mind this is like

111
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,318
back in like

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,060
really you know so this would be right

113
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,679
around the time where Neville was like

114
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,120
launching the seed bank so there

115
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,640
probably wasn't a whole lot of like

116
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,920
genetics and I mean if you even just put

117
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,419
in perspective if you fast forward four

118
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,000
or five years later

119
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:09,059
I bought my first grow light and that

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,799
was the only grow store in our entire

121
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,299
Province so the equivalent of your state

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,299
we literally had to drive like three

123
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,500
hours to buy a buy a halide light there

124
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,139
was only there was literally only one

125
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,740
store I mean it really wasn't a thing

126
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,900
so uh go ahead oh what's I just remind

127
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,840
it was wild when uh when Matt and I

128
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,620
interviewed Corel from Super sativa seed

129
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,198
Club

130
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,780
uh he had a similar story of when they

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,400
first started growing indoor uh they

132
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,978
tried to Brown it out

133
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,779
because all this lime green and green

134
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,639
color was like a real issue in the

135
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,739
market because everyone was used to like

136
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,720
imported Brown

137
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,699
and they had yesterday it was like an

138
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,680
issue like green was an issue like

139
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,060
people didn't realize it is better they

140
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,439
just saw it as something completely

141
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,079
unusual

142
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,000
if you read that I read a book by the

143
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,978
one of the guys from the cornbread Mafia

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,600
and that was pretty much their entire

145
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,819
curing technique was trying to figure

146
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,040
out how to make it brown and crappy

147
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,540
looking so it looks like import that was

148
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
literally like everything like Threw It

149
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,340
On The Barn floor and it was it was uh

150
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,160
for sure a thing and the other thing the

151
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,379
area where I came from it was very very

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,419
hash Centric so people didn't even

153
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,240
really like buying weed it was all like

154
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,339
it was all like I've mostly that Afghani

155
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,720
border Ash it was around and that was

156
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,719
like the staple and everything else

157
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,780
other than black Afghani hash was

158
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,060
totally suspect so most of it was import

159
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,159
from Afghanistan then as opposed to like

160
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,600
uh Mexican like we were getting in the

161
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,380
U.S it wasn't really making its way up

162
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,740
to Canada

163
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:42,719
I never actually saw Mexican until dead

164
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,939
tour in like Ohio or something like that

165
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,440
and uh you guys had a wholly different

166
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,180
language because I remember like looking

167
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,259
at going like someone was selling it to

168
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,300
me I was like this looks like really

169
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,919
crappy it's like it's mids dude and I

170
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,259
was like what are mids I don't know all

171
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,120
we knew was hash and and high-end Hydro

172
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,340
in Canada

173
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,959
um but yeah I know it was it was all it

174
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,159
was you'd get some other stuff but it

175
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,599
definitely wasn't the same type of

176
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,500
import you're talking about it was

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,900
pretty much 90 of it was all like that

178
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,459
Afghan you know like the gold stamps a

179
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,500
lot of it the stuff you see yeah Afghan

180
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,779
it's like border hash and then you got

181
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,779
occasional batches from Morocco or

182
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:21,119
Lebanese and then you got some weed but

183
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,758
it was usually pretty high-end like it

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,038
was like Thai stick occasionally and we

185
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,900
got a lot of like pressed Jamaican and I

186
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,659
don't think I I think I've maybe seen

187
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,939
Mexican like one time in Canada ever

188
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,039
I'm sure it was around how did you guys

189
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:38,699
used to use the hash like actually smoke

190
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:41,818
it was it the the old knife hits or like

191
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,379
a jar so the area I'm from is this like

192
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,639
tells you exactly it's one of those

193
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,860
things anywhere you go in the world and

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
everyone be like what like but in our

195
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,720
area like if they kind of the equivalent

196
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,418
of like you know New York State this

197
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,620
well like in the kind of it was it was

198
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,258
in Ontario thing so I grew up around

199
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,240
Toronto area and they did what was

200
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,620
called bottle tokes which they are

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,680
horrible when I think back but it's like

202
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,019
you get a cigarette and you put a little

203
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,879
piece of hash on it and then you break a

204
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:12,959
hole in the bottom of like a pop bottle

205
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,339
and you like Brew you brew the hash in

206
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,379
there and there's this whole technique

207
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:18,538
and then you kind of tip it over when

208
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,939
it's done and it's like a lava lamp and

209
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,439
then you suck the hash out but it was

210
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,300
like a whole like

211
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,639
you were it was like you got social

212
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,460
status and a lot in on my circles

213
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,019
anyways for like being a good BT Brewer

214
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,579
like it was like an art form be able to

215
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,560
break the bottle it was kind of when you

216
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,719
look back it was like pretty cracky but

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,339
uh that was and you'll never hear anyone

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,960
in Canada no have a clue what you're

219
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,299
talking about unless they grew up around

220
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,098
Toronto area and then everyone knows

221
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,780
what you're talking about bottles you

222
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,459
want to say you want to say cracky look

223
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,959
at some of the equipment now for dabbing

224
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:53,038
I mean it just looks like straight meth

225
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,079
bites to me you know like it's just yeah

226
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,159
yeah I'm not I'm not I kind of avoid

227
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,779
some of those

228
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,099
um even though I kind of like dabs I

229
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,839
don't dab a whole lot because I just

230
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,579
hate the whole thing and my wife can't

231
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,079
walk by dab rig without accidentally

232
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,180
breaking it so it's like an expensive

233
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,159
hobby yeah I never got into the whole

234
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,800
torch thing like that was just too much

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,180
too much too much to screw up too much

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,860
to do all that once they started getting

237
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,180
to like emails and [ __ ] or you could

238
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,400
just leave it and set it that was okay

239
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,598
it still felt a little cracky but puff

240
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:20,159
goes and stuff then it was like okay

241
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,219
this looks like more like a bong I can

242
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,599
deal with this you know yeah I feel like

243
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,699
every two or three years in the hash

244
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,378
movement right now they all kind of like

245
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,060
just move on from whatever they did

246
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,700
before that they were convinced was the

247
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,320
bee's knees yeah and it just slowly gets

248
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,560
dustbined like we're not gonna talk

249
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,000
about that era anymore that we did that

250
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,859
um but it's interesting one of the

251
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,979
things that I'll say about that is that

252
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,839
you know I grew up in uh in Northern in

253
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,300
Chicago right and so even though

254
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,839
direwolf and I aren't like too terribly

255
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:53,278
terribly far from each other uh vastly

256
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,560
different weed cultures

257
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,200
yeah you know my weed culture was

258
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,359
primarily Mexican green and brown and

259
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,759
there was almost no hash culture

260
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,220
so it's interesting how like you know

261
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,620
Canada and the different uh laws and

262
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,560
rules that applied over there led to

263
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,720
vastly different Imports that we saw

264
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,159
I think it's also what what crime

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,259
networks were working there because I

266
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,939
think the big thing if you go and from

267
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,580
Canada east to west was totally

268
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:24,720
different and so basically what was

269
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,278
going on in our area was Montreal which

270
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,899
is like there's the port that's the big

271
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,419
Port that comes into Canada from the

272
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:35,339
East Coast that was kind of controlled

273
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:36,899
by by like Irish mafia and that was

274
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,339
basically like a free you could bring

275
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,080
all kinds of stuff through there so

276
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,279
everything basically for the most part

277
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,500
was coming through that court of

278
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,320
Montreal and what was the interesting

279
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,600
thing about it we found out afterwards

280
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,660
so we kind of had like up until like

281
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,759
about 90 or something it was all this

282
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,399
black Afghani hash and then it kind of

283
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,679
went dry for like a couple of years and

284
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,899
then a guy that I was good for I was

285
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:03,899
actually living with at the time he had

286
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,440
this connection it was like this this uh

287
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,419
Irish mafia dude from Toronto and we

288
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,100
were like in University and he had for

289
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:12,419
whatever reason nobody could yeah and we

290
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,700
found it afterwards what the actual

291
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,679
story was which is crazy one nobody else

292
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,720
had hash except for this guy so we were

293
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,159
like the Kings because we're the only

294
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
guys that could get black hash which is

295
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,939
what everyone wanted and we could get

296
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,620
like however much you wanted and this

297
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,560
dude used to show up to our little like

298
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,019
you know University student house every

299
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,838
Friday night in like a limo and just

300
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,339
bring like slabs of this hash in and he

301
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,260
was just like one of those guys that

302
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,240
didn't give a crap and he'd like walk

303
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,819
out with a Ziploc full of cash and it

304
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,320
was like every Friday in and out and

305
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,300
what it turned out I found out

306
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,399
afterwards it was the reason why they

307
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:50,879
had access to this it was it was

308
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,259
actually Howard Mark's old uh stash so

309
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,620
Howard Marx would have been in jail at

310
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,360
the time but apparently he had

311
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,399
um which if you ever read that Howard's

312
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
Mark's book you end up with the Irish

313
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,240
dude which kind of all makes sense but

314
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,700
apparently he got when he went to jail

315
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,039
he had all these stash houses sitting

316
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,040
all over Montreal still full so they

317
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,419
just sat on him for a while and then it

318
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,699
started coming out through this and

319
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:16,860
that's why that's where our connect was

320
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,759
so it was all this kind of few year old

321
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,320
uh Howard marks hash and I might not be

322
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,000
true but I have a feeling it probably

323
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,120
was which probably tells you a whole lot

324
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,559
of that hack and I've heard of similar

325
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,078
overlapping stories about where all that

326
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,059
hash came from in Montreal and so it was

327
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:34,620
probably that's why everyone was smoking

328
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,659
black Afghani hash it was probably

329
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,578
because they were like one or two major

330
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,980
importers that were controlling that

331
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,599
whole thing I remember the the normal

332
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,539
story

333
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,399
um from Neville talking about nordl and

334
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,319
one of his partners and I think one of

335
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,000
Mark's partners that was that was one of

336
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,120
Mark's partners that had the nordl thing

337
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,860
right yeah

338
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,778
yeah that was their whole deal right it

339
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,360
was a guy that was yeah part of the IRA

340
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:02,639
and he smuggled they would smuggle hash

341
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,139
through the IRA networks telling them

342
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,759
that it was guns that was kind of their

343
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,360
whole that was how it marks his partner

344
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,578
yeah super gangster for back then what's

345
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,740
interesting about all that too is that

346
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:16,319
there was a lot of of hash Smugglers

347
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,079
that avoided America because the

348
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,940
penalties were so much worse

349
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,039
um and you know they they viewed America

350
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,600
sort of like the place where you went to

351
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,059
prison for a long time

352
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,420
where Europe and Canada and other places

353
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,159
were viewed as like a lot Chiller if you

354
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,559
actually got in trouble

355
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,500
yeah you know

356
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,838
so I remember they increased some of the

357
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,940
charges here if I remember during 215 I

358
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,980
remember uh like they were there were

359
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,980
bigger charges for hash or extracts than

360
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,259
there were for uh normal cannabis you

361
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,879
know cannabis flower at one point I

362
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,159
remember it was getting really bad where

363
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,860
like at one point I was pulled over on

364
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,039
the way to this I was like some hash

365
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,839
event in LA and it was like I stopped I

366
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,578
was like 4 a.m I pulled over to get gas

367
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,779
on my way out of San Diego and I didn't

368
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,759
have a license at the time that

369
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:07,919
suspended and of course I got pulled

370
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,899
over like cops sitting in the gas

371
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,539
station waiting for me you know like no

372
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,159
one else is there they were bored and uh

373
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,838
they they messed with me super hard over

374
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,879
the hash they were like you know we can

375
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,380
get you for this though you know like so

376
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,439
they they still took it seriously here

377
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:26,519
during 2 15. um concentrated cannabis

378
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,279
yeah yeah manufacturing and all

379
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,778
right did you get different grades of

380
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:33,000
how how would you I mean I know memory

381
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:34,620
can be tough but like did you think the

382
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,019
Afghani hash you were getting back then

383
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,519
was high quality

384
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,259
um so it was mixed so there was yeah

385
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,940
there was different grades I would say

386
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,740
that we didn't necessarily know they

387
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,139
were different grades

388
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,879
um but basically so a lot of it there

389
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,079
was basically three grades from what I

390
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,458
could tell there was and it was just

391
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,319
there was different batches and probably

392
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,659
the loads were mixed up and a lot of the

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,339
times back then unless you're buying the

394
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,139
whole kilo which when we were like you

395
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,700
know 15 you weren't getting

396
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,019
um you weren't seeing what the stamp was

397
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,000
on it

398
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,820
um so basically it all came in if you

399
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,500
ever see the packs it's it's uh they all

400
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,100
came pretty much all came in this red

401
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,200
cellophane paper uh wrap and some of

402
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,540
them would have gold seals like which is

403
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,180
you know probably gold spray paint with

404
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,740
whatever brand of whatever just like you

405
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,620
see with the Moroccan or you see with

406
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,259
the modern day hash and uh

407
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,139
and we all it seems like all the best

408
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,419
stuff we always had no stamp and from

409
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,459
what I understand I think that probably

410
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,899
was the case and it was kind of like the

411
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,159
good loads

412
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,139
um like the stamp stuff was the

413
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,699
commercial stuff and some came through

414
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,980
that was kind of like the dealer hash

415
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,320
and it just got each person's handy went

416
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,480
through you know that guy would take the

417
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,180
good stuff which was not stamped I don't

418
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,039
know I from that 100 but there was

419
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,019
definitely and sorry and then there was

420
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,278
kind of the third grade which kind of if

421
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,019
you talk to some people they're like it

422
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,419
was all crap and that was what was

423
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,100
called repress and I don't know what the

424
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,078
heck they did to it but like that it was

425
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,519
all controlled I think by the bikers on

426
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,039
the kind of street level and somewhere

427
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,360
along the lines uh Bubble Man actually

428
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,500
saw what they did once because he was

429
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
telling me I still don't really

430
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,860
understand what it was but it was some

431
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,259
type of thing where they would just it

432
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,180
was cut with something and it was like a

433
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,740
really noticeable like the texture was

434
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,099
different but most of the stuff that we

435
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,019
were getting was kind of really high

436
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,600
grade or a lot of it was kind of just

437
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,220
like medium was pretty good and it it's

438
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,920
interesting now the weird thing about

439
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,379
legalization in Canada now is now we

440
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,899
actually have a really thriving import

441
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:36,059
hash seen again on the black market so

442
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,740
there's like websites you can go in

443
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,719
Canada that have like the biggest hat

444
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,039
import hash selection you've ever seen

445
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,800
and they're legit like I've tried a

446
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,240
bunch of them and but it's exactly the

447
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,859
same like people say oh it used to be so

448
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,839
much better back then it's literally

449
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,800
exactly the same as what we used to go

450
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,220
yeah

451
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,679
that's crazy so what what kind of years

452
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,300
did the um Afghani plants and the indoor

453
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,919
scene start popping off in your area

454
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,979
like when you notice this started to

455
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,479
become a normal uh happenstance thing to

456
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,860
get to go to someone's house and they

457
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,039
had to grow

458
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,659
uh we were pretty like on the like my

459
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,599
crowd was that was it was going on

460
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:14,879
before that but so I was in it's

461
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,940
probably like about it was ER really

462
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:21,179
early 90s like probably like

463
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:23,699
92 93 maybe 91.

464
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,620
um that we were literally like so I went

465
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:28,500
to kind of like the Agricultural and

466
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,860
agricultural University and

467
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,539
that was like it had some of my crowd

468
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,919
kind of were the first people I'm sure

469
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,360
other people had grown but we were

470
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,838
really one of the first people that

471
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,519
really started rocking it out and it was

472
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,500
so it was not common at all like I said

473
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,000
when I went to University that was the

474
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,220
year that I bought like my first grow

475
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,440
light which was probably like 91 or

476
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,839
something and

477
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,220
yeah like there wasn't many people doing

478
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,040
it and

479
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,079
um and it was super like we were really

480
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,458
some of the only people in town like

481
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,739
everyone in our crew kind of everyone

482
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,000
was like knew who we were or heard of us

483
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,759
because we were the guys with the

484
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,439
genetics and that was pretty much so it

485
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,818
wasn't a whole lot going around going on

486
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,439
I don't think it was kind of a lot of

487
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:11,759
scenes like that like I'm sure we

488
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,319
weren't the only people in town but

489
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,240
there wasn't very many

490
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,740
when you say the genetics what kind of

491
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,900
stuff were you first growing for your

492
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,558
indoors your first indoors

493
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,059
uh my first indoor was well we I sorry

494
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,740
our very first one we were actually

495
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,019
growing import because everyone had like

496
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,660
saved all their seeds so the first real

497
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,980
real grow we did was I don't even know

498
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,660
what it was it was literally just like

499
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,700
one of my roommates hit all the seeds he

500
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,080
saved for like 10 years we popped and

501
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,779
they were all

502
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,819
um yeah pretty equatorial and hermy and

503
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,460
nothing great I think we made it all

504
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:47,960
into brownies and then where our kind of

505
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,519
Big Break came is one of my friends was

506
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,860
he had gone on dead tour to the West

507
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,720
Coast and he ended up living on some

508
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:56,599
commune I think it was in I can't

509
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,220
remember if it was in Seattle area or

510
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,859
Portland area I believe it was down in

511
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,380
Portland around Oregon and uh and he's

512
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,959
who came he came back and kind of taught

513
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,000
all of our crowd to grow so that's kind

514
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,319
of how I I Learned was from this dude

515
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,419
and he had just learned from living on

516
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,339
this commune

517
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,080
um weirdly growing blueberry indicas

518
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,220
when that was before DJ Short was even

519
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,439
around and he would always talk about

520
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,940
blueberry Indica back then that's not

521
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,798
what we were going so we were so he

522
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,298
taught us to grow and he just had some

523
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,079
old stuff from like

524
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,639
SSC and uh the seed bank so he had it

525
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,980
was mostly skunk one what we were

526
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,500
growing and then I also did

527
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,779
I did a lot of skunk number one and I

528
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,880
also did a lot of haze just because that

529
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,798
happened to be the seeds we had was a

530
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,760
silver Pearl or not a silver Pearl

531
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,079
silver

532
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,819
Haze it was something silver pearls yeah

533
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,259
is that what it was I thought it was

534
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:53,159
something different but for some reason

535
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:55,679
but anyway of some kind so I I have this

536
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,679
like thing where I like try to uh

537
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,940
discover uh all the names that Scentsy

538
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,179
changed

539
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,279
right and sometimes you know it's like a

540
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,740
hobby or whatever and so one of the

541
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,538
interesting Parts is when when Scentsy

542
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,000
bought Neville's seed bank they wanted

543
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:13,679
to obscure how much of it was just a

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,200
direct Port over from the seed bank

545
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,280
itself so they ended up changing a bunch

546
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,440
of names right uh but the big clue

547
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,259
um with silver haze was that they in

548
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,900
Scentsy they claimed in the silver haze

549
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,359
advertisement in the in the book that it

550
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,280
won the 89 it won the overall 89

551
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,379
Cannabis Cup

552
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,599
so you go look at what won the 89

553
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,940
Cannabis Cup and it's silver Pearl by

554
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,918
Hayes from Neville

555
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,860
they had to put it in there I mean you

556
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,059
got to get the advertisement yeah yeah

557
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,979
so that that was actually like a really

558
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,960
helpful piece of information because we

559
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,599
actually have like uh we have photos of

560
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,519
the old of the old Magazine spread

561
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,798
and it's right there you know so it

562
00:19:53,519 --> 00:20:00,179
started out as like early Pearl by Skunk

563
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:01,859
one by nl5 by Haze yeah and then it got

564
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,360
changed the silver I thought it was and

565
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,279
then I thought somebody said it was an

566
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,019
Ortega or something so I I was thinking

567
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,178
maybe that but I I originally had saw

568
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,740
what you're saying so so you're right

569
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,759
too there's this weird thing where

570
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:18,058
Neville used to call uh a maple leaf by

571
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,160
uh heat crossed Afghan tea to Haze as

572
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:22,798
well and he called that silver haze but

573
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,440
I don't think he actually ever sold it I

574
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,058
think he kept it private and that's one

575
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,419
of the ones that Shantae uses a lot now

576
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:32,339
if I'm correct is yeah

577
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:34,259
from C from seed at least yeah so he

578
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:36,480
crossed when he the first two things

579
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,759
that he crossed Hayes you know it was

580
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,980
Afghan T and nl5

581
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,798
and nl5 obviously got released and

582
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,620
became the super popular thing

583
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,538
um uh but anyway yeah yeah the uh the 89

584
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,099
Cannabis Cup winner silver Pearl by

585
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,440
Hayes so

586
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:54,119
that's a good one yeah it was a weird

587
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,080
one to start with like we start when we

588
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,819
had no idea it was just the only

589
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,139
genetics we had so we were running all

590
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,240
this Haze and it wasn't super long

591
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,160
flowering like they were they were I

592
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,259
think we I crossed it that was kind of

593
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,880
the first kind of messing with genetics

594
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,319
that I really did is I crossed just

595
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,380
because that's what we had I crossed

596
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,000
some of that silver haze with like a uh

597
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,980
skunk number one and we kind of had like

598
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,480
the seed line that we kept popping for a

599
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,099
long time just because it was the only

600
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
genetics we had and it was it was weird

601
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,519
because it was actually really similar

602
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,319
to like that sweet skunk that that I

603
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,418
grow now and that's partly why I grow it

604
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,099
it totally like reminds me of like 1993

605
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,740
or whatever when we were growing these

606
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:31,259
uh silver haze crosses I could see that

607
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,339
being really good though like a a skunk

608
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:34,259
one

609
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,199
silver Pearl hey like that would be

610
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:39,419
pretty legit I would think like it would

611
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,779
be fast flowering probably have good

612
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:45,120
butt structure good resin production

613
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:46,259
relatively fast it was like 70 days and

614
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,719
then we were probably picking it too

615
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,640
early back then it was probably 70 or 75

616
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,259
days I would I would think but it was it

617
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,340
it yielded but it wasn't yeah it

618
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:55,379
wouldn't have been like a great cash

619
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:57,538
Cropper and then the other weird one

620
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,860
that you never said I've never most like

621
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:01,259
I said most of the stuff you see back

622
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,418
then I'm like it's still pretty similar

623
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:04,679
to what stuff like there's a lot of

624
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,120
stuff now that's pretty similar to it

625
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,460
the one that I've never seen that was

626
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,839
like it is we used to have this Durban

627
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,200
which for sure it was one of my buddies

628
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,699
brought it back from Scentsy and uh and

629
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,100
it was until I've never seen anything

630
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,319
like that it was really like it could

631
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:20,879
quite well if I had Indica in it but it

632
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,918
didn't look because it kind of it was

633
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,419
like finished really quick and it kind

634
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,538
of had a short stature but it was like

635
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:30,600
this really weird like full-on sativa

636
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:33,058
but with really dark leaves and uh and

637
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,798
it totally had that this crazy like

638
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:37,079
Anna's taste like you hear people say

639
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,940
with dirt it wasn't super potent but it

640
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:40,259
was definitely like pretty unique it was

641
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,179
one of the better tasting weeds that

642
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,259
I've ever had and I've tried a bunch of

643
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,659
Durban since and I've never seen

644
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:48,000
anything remotely like that one yeah I

645
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,280
don't really see the the annisturban at

646
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,859
all ever and like you hear these Tales

647
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,019
of this this beautiful Scentsy Durban

648
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,819
and you just it did for some reason the

649
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:58,319
the terminal one seems to be the one

650
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:00,359
everybody kept because that just seems

651
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,220
to be what I run into you know yeah this

652
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,599
was a hundred percent just like Anna so

653
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,519
there was like no doubt about it but

654
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,339
that's what it was that's really cool I

655
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,460
mean it's certainly a shame

656
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:12,480
um because we're talking about things

657
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,519
realistically speaking that aren't that

658
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,500
that long ago but the nature of

659
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,879
prohibition kind of means that like was

660
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,220
you know you could have something that

661
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,419
was common and five or ten years go by

662
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,519
and all of a sudden it's just

663
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,780
disappeared yeah

664
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,819
you know

665
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:29,759
so talk about some of your early crosses

666
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:32,339
dude like you talked about the skunk one

667
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,839
by silver haze was there any other ones

668
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:38,038
that you were doing doing early on that

669
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:40,439
you found success in or weird stuff in

670
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,119
um I did we did a bunch there was one

671
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,000
that we can go go into a bit but

672
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,739
honestly like I didn't you were so I've

673
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,659
always been like I'm pretty big on like

674
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,659
not messing around unless you can pop

675
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:53,280
some decent amounts of like numbers yeah

676
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,400
you could never really pop that many

677
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,740
that much for numbers so the only one so

678
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,360
I did kind of so I played around early

679
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,679
and then for a big part of when I was

680
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,538
growing I just kind of got out of it

681
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,038
because I was so worried about plant can

682
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,200
all the time the last thing I wanted to

683
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,000
be doing is like popping males and and

684
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,980
stuff like that but the one so the one I

685
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,079
think I told you guys about where I was

686
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,240
joking that maybe it was the uh the

687
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,339
purple Urkel precursor that was the only

688
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,679
one that I ever did that was kind of got

689
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,720
pretty famous and it was uh

690
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,059
at the time there was no there's really

691
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,298
no purple weed and I had gone to

692
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:29,339
Amsterdam and brought back uh we went to

693
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,900
positronics and I brought back a bunch

694
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:33,599
of stuff and one of them was this strain

695
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,340
called Purple star purple was like yeah

696
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,658
yeah yeah well they don't I don't think

697
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,579
it's even I don't know if that's even a

698
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,500
thing in Harlem but they used to be they

699
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:42,558
have all these different purple strains

700
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,140
that were for outdoors yes

701
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,759
passion had and Paws he had and probably

702
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,320
a couple others and anyways I brought

703
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,538
that back and it was like actually a

704
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,879
pretty good yield or it didn't it wasn't

705
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:55,379
really very good quality but it looked

706
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,960
decent and it was like a total knob it

707
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,280
was like super purple yeah I had crossed

708
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,279
that to

709
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,918
uh we had like a skunk number one cross

710
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:07,619
with Hindu Kush and I crossed it to this

711
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,840
purple star and we actually got some

712
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,000
pretty nice ones that were kind of like

713
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,558
way way nicer than the purple star like

714
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,240
they were kind of indoor quality yeah

715
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:20,158
and uh and we had that and I gave my old

716
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,659
partner at the time he had moved out

717
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,880
west

718
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,740
um to kind of like our little humble

719
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,778
which is like the Kootenays which is

720
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,319
like Nelson BC and he had moved out

721
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:32,880
there and he before he left he grabbed a

722
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,939
whole crop load of those seeds and I

723
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,400
don't know if it was the Hindu skunk uh

724
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,440
purple star or if it was that I think it

725
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,840
was actually that it was mixed with that

726
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,460
crossed with a an aurora Indica which

727
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,099
was a Northern Lights during the Posse

728
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,440
pad anyways he popped like quite a lot

729
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,538
like he popped like a hundred or two of

730
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,600
those and got this one that they called

731
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:57,058
they just called it papaya and it was

732
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,798
like this really nice uh purple it was

733
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:01,079
kind of like checkerboard purple pattern

734
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,460
and these guys were like big they were

735
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,000
like Ballers like so they were doing

736
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:09,778
they were in like the export crowd and

737
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,599
uh and that clone just totally blew up

738
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:14,339
um and for a while so in BC there's kind

739
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:15,778
of like everyone always talked whenever

740
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,099
most people that you hear talk they're

741
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:19,319
always talking about like Coastal BC

742
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:22,079
like Vancouver area yeah if you go

743
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,460
Inland with 10 hours there's this is

744
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,599
where the Kootenays are and that's where

745
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,940
our real like

746
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,278
that's where the real players

747
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,320
go so for a while for like a couple of

748
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,000
years there was a that was like one of

749
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,379
the most popular clones being grown

750
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,298
there was this papaya thing and that's

751
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,940
why I was uh

752
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:42,119
joking because when when Nazo was saying

753
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,159
they used to call Oracle uh the Barney

754
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,899
and that's what the buyers used to call

755
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,700
this stuff was the Barney but it was

756
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,480
probably seven years ago what years was

757
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,159
that

758
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,919
would have been like

759
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,539
I would think it was probably like late

760
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,538
like late 90s like somewhere between

761
00:26:54,538 --> 00:27:00,900
like 98 and 2000 probably

762
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:02,700
because the interesting part about the

763
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,640
um you know a lot of the purple cuts

764
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,400
that became famous uh in Northern

765
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,799
California and kind of in our scene is

766
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,679
that there's a lot of like people that

767
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:16,500
claim things to you know about them but

768
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,900
there's very little like uh verifiable

769
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,319
fact yeah right

770
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,720
um which is unusual for a strain strains

771
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,759
that got that famous to stay that

772
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,140
obscure for that long

773
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,119
um and there's a lot of competing things

774
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,759
and there's there's actually a guy in

775
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,500
Mendo I won't mention his name but there

776
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:37,379
was a there was kind of a kooky guy in

777
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:41,460
Mendo who claims uh that he went up to

778
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:45,720
BC uh and ended up uh smuggling clones

779
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:48,000
back taped to his thigh uh in cigar in

780
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,538
cigar cases like in cigar you know like

781
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,159
cigars like the tubes yeah the tubes

782
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:56,339
um and he taped him to his thigh this is

783
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,600
pre when pre before Osama ruined flying

784
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:59,459
yeah

785
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,678
um you know when uh you know when

786
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,419
airport security got a lot rougher after

787
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,580
2001.

788
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,659
um but pre to that uh it was a lot

789
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:09,720
looser

790
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:14,039
and he he swears to God that he brought

791
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,600
these clones from uh from BC uh down to

792
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,240
Mendo

793
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,339
um just just to be super clear I'm not

794
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,620
making any claims to purple Urkel and

795
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:25,139
just joking no I get it no believe me

796
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:27,479
well that's the thing right is that

797
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,278
there are people that will tell you with

798
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,140
absolute certainty that this is what it

799
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,119
is yeah and then you start poking around

800
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,679
in it and if you and there's holes and

801
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,359
this and that

802
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,538
um it's one of the few things that that

803
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,339
with purple Urkel with Grape Ape with uh

804
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:43,859
lavender and things like that there

805
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:45,959
really isn't a settled story

806
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:48,000
yeah that everyone believes there's some

807
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,000
competing stories and there's ones that

808
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,579
like we're pretty sure aren't true

809
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,619
um but you know for for as famous as it

810
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:57,720
was and as big of an issue as it was in

811
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:00,000
California for a while

812
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,860
um most of those most of not all but

813
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,019
most of those purple cuts the origins

814
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:06,119
are still kind of a mystery it was it's

815
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,220
cool that you mentioned purple star

816
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,739
um purple star is actually one of the

817
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,400
baselines of purples for for purple

818
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,019
number one for Shaman for a lot of the

819
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,820
Dutch purples all came from that purple

820
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,000
is it related to Viking

821
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:22,859
I think I I think they all probably came

822
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,599
from Viking because I think Viking kind

823
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,519
of predates those and they were all

824
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:29,038
pretty I think they were definitely

825
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,839
related because we get that cream sodica

826
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,819
you hear about it yeah it was totally

827
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,259
out of that same family

828
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:36,359
um they just you look at me like that's

829
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:40,019
one of those old crappy purple Dutch

830
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:42,538
outdoor screams positronics about a year

831
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:46,379
and a half ago they they went into their

832
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:48,538
their uh Library uh mom seeds their

833
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,340
their parent seeds and whatnot and they

834
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,839
were kind enough to take me out the

835
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,759
parentage of purple star or whatever

836
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,558
they used to make it and they sent me

837
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,480
the seats but they disappeared on the

838
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:58,859
way here I was so bummed because I was

839
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,079
like I finally get to look at the

840
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,519
parents of purple star like most people

841
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:04,740
wouldn't be that stoked about it because

842
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,778
it's kind of goofy and you know it would

843
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,079
be it's interesting to me it would be

844
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:13,200
really funny honestly if if there's an

845
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,678
element of that story is true because

846
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,720
um you know coming being in California

847
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,419
uh when this is fast forward a bit so we

848
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,399
can go back after but one of the things

849
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,799
that really made the purple craze in

850
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:27,239
like

851
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,819
030405 really take off

852
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,079
was that California was getting flooded

853
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:34,980
by

854
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:37,259
uh you know beat by Canadian indoor yeah

855
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,599
and once Brokers learned that the

856
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:41,398
Canadian indoor was so much cheaper than

857
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,219
California homegrown

858
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,558
they started buying it and trying to

859
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,380
pass it off as California homegrown and

860
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:53,099
making massive margins and a lot of it

861
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:55,020
was pretty Mitzi you know it was just it

862
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:58,379
wasn't flushed right it was grown with

863
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:00,898
too high EC it was in their best down

864
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,000
here yeah well and you know it was it

865
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:05,459
was also it was sealed in a in a vacuum

866
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,500
sealer you know so it kind of fermented

867
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,940
a little bit like in in transport not

868
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,220
that there wasn't some good stuff coming

869
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,778
down but a lot of it was bad and one of

870
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,579
the things in California especially in

871
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:19,200
the bay that started the purple craze

872
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:21,480
was that the purple wasn't Canadian

873
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,399
like it was homegrown

874
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,440
you know and you knew it was from

875
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:30,479
California because people were getting

876
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,159
bumped by buying weed for 4 400 that was

877
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,679
Canadian that these guys were buying for

878
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,380
two grand yeah and making the difference

879
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,419
you know so it was like that was one of

880
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:44,278
the things that started the purple craze

881
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:47,220
uh in NorCal was uh there wasn't any BC

882
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,798
coming down that was purple at the time

883
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,659
and so it was like a it was marketing

884
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:54,538
yeah it was early marketing

885
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,278
honestly and and 215 it opened up in

886
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:59,038
California enough that once it got into

887
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:01,140
the clubs and once you know popularity

888
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,359
spiked then it just was rolling and it

889
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,880
was a it was a marketable thing

890
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,038
I think the beasters guys got a little

891
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,539
bit of a bad rap just for you know that

892
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:11,278
all the good stuff that went down just

893
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:13,859
got called and passed humble and nobody

894
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,778
questions and all the crap stuff this

895
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,579
guy oh this beasters so and I think they

896
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:19,440
did so they definitely did not

897
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:20,879
disappearing there was a lot of beasters

898
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,940
got shut down I think we actually

899
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,520
probably kept the worst beasters up here

900
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,980
because if you go the kind of backstory

901
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,619
of like the commercial Market here was

902
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,960
always this cut called M39 which is like

903
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,699
yeah I can't imagine anybody ever

904
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,460
exported that but maybe they did and it

905
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,580
was like this it was probably just M39

906
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,240
from SSC which I think was just skunk NL

907
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:48,240
and it was just it was rock hard

908
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,220
orange like like they probably literally

909
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,440
cut them at 39 days or something and I

910
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,500
mean it was still to this day the worst

911
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,419
weed I've ever smoked everything you

912
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,579
know you know what's so funny about this

913
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:02,159
fan is that these days

914
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:04,798
um people most people who smoke weren't

915
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,720
around back then and so there are a

916
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,918
bunch of people that are you know there

917
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,899
are some people out there that are

918
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,899
they're touting that they have M39

919
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,220
red dog's one who's bringing back to M39

920
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,199
yeah and and you know there's an aspect

921
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,940
of it because most people all they

922
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,860
remember is the name

923
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,200
yeah you know

924
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:27,719
all they remember is the name one thing

925
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,919
I wanted to ask you before I forgot is

926
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,919
that yeah

927
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,659
um when you were on uh you know

928
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
before I before you and I had even

929
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,760
chatted you had posted this picture uh

930
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,740
on your IG of this old Northern Lights

931
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,419
clone

932
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,819
uh yeah that was the first one I ever

933
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:47,159
posted on IG yeah and I was wondering

934
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:48,778
and that to me

935
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,399
um I would just want you know if you

936
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,140
could expound on that cutting a little

937
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,459
bit because I remember it where you were

938
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,700
like oh you know this is from the late

939
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,819
80s it it descends from the seed bank

940
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:03,000
era we lost it but it was a staple for

941
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:05,278
you know 20 plus years yeah that was the

942
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,558
closest thing in my career that was I

943
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,878
would consider like a long like our

944
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:11,338
cruise like I said it was pretty rough

945
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,559
so people didn't really keep Cuts around

946
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:15,179
and they were all chasing most of my I

947
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,279
was never like super big into the

948
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,619
commercial scene but a lot of my friends

949
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,940
were like big like they were heavily

950
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,139
into the commercial scene so they were

951
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,700
chasing just no different than today

952
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,220
everyone's chasing whatever the newest

953
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,779
gelato cross is or something they were

954
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,719
chasing whatever was hypey so they never

955
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,720
kept anything and this and that specific

956
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,819
NL clone was around our crew for a long

957
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,799
time and it originally came from that

958
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,080
same guy I was talking about before the

959
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,460
papaya clone came I mean it's kind of

960
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,539
like my original part partner when we

961
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,918
were younger like we got started

962
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,559
together we're still good friends today

963
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,358
and he was always like in the thick of

964
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,039
things so that was he was kind of one of

965
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:51,838
my kind of main connections because he

966
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,039
hung out with some people I had zero

967
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,838
interest in hanging out with but they

968
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,300
always had good genetics and stuff and

969
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,858
he had brought it back out from uh

970
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,019
Nelson

971
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:03,659
um and they did they had gotten it there

972
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,880
from one of my friends dads who lives

973
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:08,219
just outside of Vancouver a place called

974
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,539
Squamish and yeah that one we could

975
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:10,858
definitely Trace back because it was

976
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:13,139
literally like I know the guy it came

977
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:15,539
from and it was like his dad and it was

978
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:16,739
from whatever like I don't remember 87

979
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,739
or something like that it was right

980
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:21,959
around like that time period and that

981
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:25,319
one was totally it looked just like a

982
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,659
lot of the NLS that we've grown but it

983
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,359
totally had a completely different terp

984
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,739
profile and was way way Frost here like

985
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,199
that was the first plan I'd ever seen

986
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:35,759
that had like if you grew it right that

987
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,219
picture doesn't probably do it justice

988
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,839
if you grew it right it was one of those

989
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,399
ones that had kind of like remember on

990
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,019
the white widows where the resin went

991
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,539
like right to the end of like the Sugar

992
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:48,838
Leaf like or even hard on the fan it did

993
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:51,420
that and it was uh just crazy Terps like

994
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,739
I remember the one guy uh one of my

995
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,079
friends that used to move a lot of it

996
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:57,118
and you like it would just he used to

997
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,859
keep it in his freezer and you'd crack

998
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,260
the freezer and just like his whole

999
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:02,880
house would smell and I've it was a

1000
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,760
really unique terp profile that I

1001
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,460
honestly can't even put a finger on I

1002
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,619
kind of wonder whether it's maybe when

1003
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,780
um Neville talks about those Juniper

1004
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,640
flavors it was maybe that but it was

1005
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,820
like it was a weird like kind of outer

1006
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:21,000
Spacey type of uh flavor that I've never

1007
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,039
really had since and but that one was

1008
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,019
definitely like around our crowd for a

1009
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,699
long time because I remember like not

1010
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:28,440
keeping it and then being man I really

1011
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,358
want that or someone to be asking for it

1012
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,338
and I'd go find it and I could always

1013
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,319
like a friend of a friend's brother had

1014
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:36,299
that we just called it Dan L clone and

1015
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,220
it made ridiculous hash and it made

1016
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,780
ridiculous amounts of hash because it

1017
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:42,179
was kind of pretty leafy so you got a

1018
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,240
lot of trim but I remember just pulling

1019
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:47,578
like I can't remember what the ratio was

1020
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:49,078
but just giant hunks of hash off that

1021
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,940
all the time

1022
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,619
I was trying I'm always in picture of it

1023
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,059
for so everybody can see it but I'm

1024
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,400
always interested in that kind of stuff

1025
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:58,739
because we have so few pictures that

1026
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,358
survive of a lot of those original

1027
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:01,919
strains

1028
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:04,799
um and especially like you know ones

1029
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,420
that people found in those lines

1030
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,940
um and some lines we have a few pictures

1031
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,559
and other lines you know it's kind of a

1032
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,900
mystery

1033
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,219
um and I have it saved just because you

1034
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,019
know what it reminds me of and it's not

1035
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:18,118
exact because I know it's a hybrid but

1036
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:20,820
the way that it's super Frosty and the

1037
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,338
way that the top crowns it kind of

1038
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,099
reminded me of Bubba

1039
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:27,420
yeah I find all the NLS remind me of

1040
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,400
Bubba like especially so were the other

1041
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,400
ones that we had there it is right there

1042
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,440
yeah there you go yeah perfect yeah that

1043
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,960
that just reminds me not exactly because

1044
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,539
bub is a hybrid or whatever but like it

1045
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,460
just reminds me of like that especially

1046
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,759
when Neville would talk about like a

1047
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:47,599
single Cola kind of small you know like

1048
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,640
almost yellowish at times very resinous

1049
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,039
uh short Afghan

1050
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,199
um it really it really matches up well

1051
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,019
with his description of what his NL was

1052
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,960
yeah it might even grow slower than

1053
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:02,820
Bubba it was a really super it was the

1054
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,199
squattest plant I've ever grown and I

1055
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,180
think because it was so old it had

1056
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,858
really lost a lot of vigor but it was

1057
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:10,259
brutal and I remember at the time we had

1058
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:11,819
like this really strong plant count so

1059
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,040
this was kind of late when I was growing

1060
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,619
it and I used to grow it as trees into

1061
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:19,079
like a vertical scrog setup there were

1062
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:22,320
six feet so six feet tall trees into

1063
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,839
like a scrog and it was just took for

1064
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,480
freaking ever to to get it up to size

1065
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,880
and I actually used to I used to

1066
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,099
actually spray it with a really low

1067
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,800
doses of gibberellic acid just to make

1068
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,019
the internet like during the during the

1069
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,900
veg time yeah that's an old trick for

1070
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:41,400
for squatty ones that's cool

1071
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,800
so what kind of chirp profile did you

1072
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,900
say it had like honestly

1073
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,880
I could I it doesn't compare to anything

1074
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,220
I've tried now like I would say it was

1075
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,440
no stronger like it was similar to a lot

1076
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:54,539
of the modern stuff but I mean it's not

1077
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,760
in flavor but in like strength of Terps

1078
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:58,858
so it probably had you know probably at

1079
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,660
least three percent Terps which was on

1080
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:02,699
but if you compare it to what was going

1081
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:04,559
around back then like that was it was

1082
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:07,039
totally another level than most stuff

1083
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,039
going around

1084
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:11,760
it was a weird it almost had a little

1085
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,500
bit of a it was really hashy but it

1086
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,140
really had kind of like there was some

1087
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,780
fruit like almost like a grapey

1088
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:21,539
tone to it it was just it was one that I

1089
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,920
it's kind of like I would it was just

1090
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:24,599
really hard to describe it was kind of

1091
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,159
like oh gee there's a lot of stuff weird

1092
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,838
stuff

1093
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,399
um going in there but that's honestly

1094
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,259
when I looked back that's one of the few

1095
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,720
that I'm like oh that would that one

1096
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,400
would still be cool to have and it would

1097
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,838
be novel now that it's something that

1098
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,780
nobody else

1099
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,219
um nobody else has I don't think it was

1100
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,720
necessarily better than anything that's

1101
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,279
around now but it would hold its it

1102
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,199
would still hold it hold its weight

1103
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,400
compared to like modern stuff which I

1104
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:49,439
would say most of the stuff from that

1105
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,780
era definitely wouldn't

1106
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,200
yeah I mean what what year did it end up

1107
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,940
uh kind of fading out and going missing

1108
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,799
uh it would have been the exact one if

1109
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,599
you look at when Stephen Harper became

1110
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,280
prime minister of Canada I was the last

1111
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,780
guy holding it and I got rid of it when

1112
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,400
he came in because he put all these

1113
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,680
crazy mandatory minimums and I couldn't

1114
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,900
hold my uh cuttings I'm thinking it was

1115
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:14,039
probably like

1116
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,039
2003 or something like that 2004.

1117
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,599
yeah they had it literally down to I

1118
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,400
think you're gonna go to jail for five

1119
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,559
years for five plants or something

1120
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,960
mandatory minimum so I that was a time

1121
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,578
when I was like okay like breeding and

1122
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,059
keeping lots of mothers kind of went out

1123
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:33,000
the uh window under under that dude

1124
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:35,299
and since we're uh since we're on that

1125
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,039
that sort of era subject I have another

1126
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:41,099
uh IG post you made that I wanted to

1127
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:43,320
chat about which was um I went out to

1128
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,519
the Cannabis cups in the late 90s a few

1129
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,900
times

1130
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,300
um and one of the things I brought back

1131
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,160
which I wish I still had seeds of was

1132
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,920
the first year that they released

1133
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,598
Neville's Haze

1134
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,420
um and I think it's actually one of the

1135
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,420
first things you and I chatted about uh

1136
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,338
was you posted these pictures of some

1137
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,039
old Neville's Hayes Groves

1138
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:06,480
uh and I think you got that you got that

1139
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,519
Neville's Haze right around that same

1140
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,740
era right the late 90s

1141
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,239
uh it was I think it was two thousand so

1142
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:14,699
it wasn't right when they it was the

1143
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,618
first round of seeds that I garbage had

1144
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:17,519
been around for a little bit

1145
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:19,500
um

1146
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,300
but I I remember exactly when it was

1147
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,820
because it was uh I'm pretty sure it was

1148
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,859
right around it was like 99 or 2000 and

1149
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,380
I think it got released in 98 so that's

1150
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,819
basically like the very first era of it

1151
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,039
yeah

1152
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,680
yeah it was when I first decided I kind

1153
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,000
of got out of like the whatever I was

1154
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,078
just branched out and was like you know

1155
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,760
what I'm just gonna try growing some

1156
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:41,519
different stuff and I don't really care

1157
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,780
whatever if it looks nice and stuff so I

1158
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,119
just started playing around with a lot

1159
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,920
of different plants and and that was one

1160
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,079
so I started doing some hazes and that

1161
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,519
was uh one of the ones I think actually

1162
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,099
how we started talking was actually

1163
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,800
Ortega because I threw out a lot of that

1164
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:58,380
too Maple Leaf Indica

1165
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,240
um as well but um

1166
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,180
yeah that Novelties was that was the

1167
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,459
Learning lesson but that was pretty uh I

1168
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:07,980
grew up yeah I think I had like I think

1169
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,900
I had three packs of that and I grew

1170
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,579
them uh grew them all that I actually

1171
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,740
got some most of it was pretty jungly

1172
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,920
weed but I mean it was crazy

1173
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,779
strong right just like the extracts and

1174
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,579
that stuff were just scary and yeah

1175
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,240
that's the picture right there

1176
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,220
um

1177
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,019
but I actually one of the cooler plants

1178
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:26,939
I've ever grown came out of that pack it

1179
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:30,119
was one that looked full-on like City

1180
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,700
like really Haze structure and the buds

1181
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,980
were little were dead on like nl5

1182
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:36,838
miniature little pine cone buds but they

1183
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,199
were literally like half a centimeter

1184
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:42,000
long kind of like little sativa buds but

1185
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:43,439
they were rock hard little Indica things

1186
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,300
and they were literally like look like

1187
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,980
little candies or something it was still

1188
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,660
one of the most bizarre hybrid

1189
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,820
Expressions I've ever seen it tasted

1190
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:52,618
like had that kind of incensey taste it

1191
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,039
definitely leaned more towards the nl5

1192
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:57,660
but it was a cool uh cool plant yeah one

1193
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,219
of the things one of the things I liked

1194
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:01,078
about your description of it was I think

1195
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:04,078
you nicknamed one of those cuts party

1196
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,760
Slayer because the high made so many

1197
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,400
people uncomfortable it would like kill

1198
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,440
the vibe when you brought it yeah so we

1199
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,420
had at the time there was one of my

1200
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,059
friends was had that he lived just kind

1201
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,680
of an hour or so north of Toronto and in

1202
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,900
this kind of pretty small town it was

1203
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,879
like no it's tiny it's like probably 30

1204
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,740
000. and he used to sell most of the

1205
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,700
weed to like the 20 something year olds

1206
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:28,439
crowd there and we had a batch of we

1207
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:29,879
just ended up having two we were just

1208
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,980
growing it for like hobby stuff and we

1209
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,019
ended up having too much every once in a

1210
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,338
while so so some of this Neville's Haze

1211
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:37,139
would end up going into like the

1212
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:38,699
commercial Market with no there was no

1213
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:41,219
names back then right so we'd just sell

1214
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:43,980
this crappy looking weed

1215
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,439
and my buddy would would uh sell it in

1216
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,639
and everyone I think I think we're

1217
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,019
having

1218
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,338
all right which is I I don't remember

1219
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:51,960
the story but it was it looked like crap

1220
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:54,059
and everyone was like thinking it was

1221
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,400
swag and uh

1222
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:58,920
yeah they would all puff that stuff and

1223
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,019
that was no we had a bad batch that

1224
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,460
didn't burn well so they were all like

1225
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:05,699
really huffing on it trying to get the

1226
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,380
thing to burn properly and then they and

1227
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:10,019
there's no idea and you know it's got

1228
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,579
like a 20 minute creep on it so they

1229
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,318
would all be trying to you know puff him

1230
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:16,318
furiously on this doobie to try and get

1231
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:18,059
it to burn properly and uh

1232
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:19,679
I think the nutrients has gotten mixed

1233
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:21,599
up because the you know we weren't used

1234
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,639
to Growing like 16 weeks of Tevas and

1235
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,579
stuff and uh and then everyone would get

1236
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,838
like super super high and uh and then

1237
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,700
the whole party would end and that was

1238
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:30,960
it became like legend for like a year or

1239
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:33,000
so there was all this level so he's

1240
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,338
gonna dumped into this so it was like

1241
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,318
they were literally that dude you used

1242
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:40,078
to sell like M39 which you could

1243
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:43,139
basically not get high off of a little

1244
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,560
bit of that NL and then this the no burn

1245
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:48,179
the no burn uh

1246
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:49,500
yeah you were telling me a story too I

1247
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:51,299
think about like your friends that were

1248
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,358
in construction and they got too high to

1249
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,460
even come off the roof oh yeah yeah so I

1250
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,559
used to have this one friend who's was

1251
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,579
one of the heaviest uh smokers you'll

1252
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:04,259
ever meet and he always used to like uh

1253
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:05,880
you know you got like a super killer

1254
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,859
weed and most people backward be like

1255
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,260
holy cow like that was so good and you

1256
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:12,239
could never phase dawn like Dawn was

1257
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,280
just like you could give him like the

1258
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,139
you know that bubble hash from that

1259
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,640
crazy Northern Lights clone I gave him

1260
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:19,739
one points thinking this is going to

1261
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,838
blow him away and you just like did this

1262
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:24,059
massive like dab of it and was just like

1263
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:27,119
so it's okay like nothing would phase

1264
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:30,119
this dude and uh him and one of his

1265
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,680
buddies had a roofing company and they I

1266
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,800
hadn't seen him for like a year or so I

1267
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,899
had moved away from town and uh I needed

1268
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,480
a new roof on my house so and I had this

1269
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,160
one like a really steep roof that was a

1270
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,920
little treacherous to be walking around

1271
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:46,379
and before they went on to redo the roof

1272
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,680
he's like you got any weed so I had this

1273
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,660
uh Neville's Haze it was Neville's Haze

1274
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,940
mixed with Neville's Hayes hash and it

1275
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:55,858
was like really strong this joint I

1276
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,980
probably did it purposely really strong

1277
00:45:55,858 --> 00:46:00,480
just to try and phase Dawn and uh they

1278
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,280
smoked it wasn't even that big of a

1279
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,599
joint they smoked this thing and I just

1280
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,400
thought nothing because nothing ever

1281
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,960
phased this dude and then I was like

1282
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,619
where are those dudes like they've been

1283
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,240
up there for so long so I yelled up and

1284
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:13,500
they like stuck their head over the roof

1285
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,199
and they're like yeah we just got to sit

1286
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,119
it out up here for a while man

1287
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,779
they were up there for hours just

1288
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,640
tripping on this Neville's Hayes hatch

1289
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,160
I mean I I literally I have this clear

1290
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:27,420
memory of smoking what I would classify

1291
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,940
as a Pinner

1292
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,159
of Neville's Haze uh when I first tried

1293
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,619
it with two other people so I probably

1294
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,059
only got three or four Good Hits off it

1295
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,800
before it was gone

1296
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:41,099
and I have this clear memory in

1297
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,760
Amsterdam of like walking out of dude's

1298
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:47,338
house and like gripping the railing for

1299
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,260
the six steps down to the road like

1300
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,779
gripping it with my life because I

1301
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,400
didn't want to fall

1302
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,800
you know and like it messed with my

1303
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,980
equilibrium and like I was soaring high

1304
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,440
and it hit me in such an unusual way I

1305
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,599
could absolutely see like being like I

1306
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,818
am not [ __ ] with that ladder at all

1307
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,420
yeah like there is no ladder in my

1308
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:11,039
future for a while I sit here where I'm

1309
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,619
at I'm gonna sit where I'm at and I'm

1310
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,960
gonna wait until the ladder makes sense

1311
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,420
because I have this memory of like like

1312
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,858
being like I can't go down these steps

1313
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,619
without

1314
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,358
this railing without assistance yeah

1315
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:26,400
like I needed and I was like you know I

1316
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:28,139
don't know 23 or something like that and

1317
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,660
it was totally nice weather they were

1318
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:32,338
dry steps and I was like I wanted to

1319
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:35,219
make sure that I had a center when I

1320
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:37,380
walked down them yeah so it was

1321
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,879
definitely like the extract of so Hayes

1322
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,619
is like I always find he's like you can

1323
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,420
smoke if you smoke regularly like you

1324
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,980
smoke I find most people you just get

1325
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,740
hit every once in a while you can smoke

1326
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,358
Haze and it's like just because I don't

1327
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,459
think it's super strong it just but it's

1328
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:51,900
when you just smoke a little bit too

1329
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,280
much which is a lot easier when you're

1330
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,680
smoking like a hash joint or something

1331
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,000
and it just you know creeps up on you

1332
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,519
and all of a sudden you're taking the

1333
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,019
you know the night bus downtown

1334
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,579
um but I have all the time I have people

1335
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:04,739
that smoke all the time that I'll give

1336
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,240
like that sweet skunk to and it doesn't

1337
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:07,618
look that great and they're used to

1338
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,259
smoking cookies and a lot of them have

1339
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:13,079
just never even smoked like proper Haze

1340
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,240
and uh you always hear kind of similar

1341
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,300
stories where somebody Just Smokes every

1342
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,858
day was like what the heck was

1343
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:22,500
because they just got caught sideways by

1344
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:26,219
it maybe science will eventually tell

1345
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:28,199
you but if you you can be like uh very

1346
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:30,059
used to smoking a lot of like what we

1347
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:32,818
would consider high-end strains these

1348
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:35,219
days like chems and Bubbas and you know

1349
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:38,519
and and ogs and different things and

1350
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:40,259
there's an aspect to hazes where they

1351
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:41,639
just kind of hit you a bit sometimes

1352
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,960
like you're a newbie and you don't have

1353
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:45,598
a tolerance

1354
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,740
yeah no for sure it's nothing that I I

1355
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,838
generally

1356
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:50,519
I maybe smoke a bit more now but I

1357
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:53,578
remember back then I definitely couldn't

1358
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:55,619
smoke uh hazes every day like I remember

1359
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:57,539
thinking I was like this you know weed

1360
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:59,099
snobbling like oh only like hazes is the

1361
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:01,079
best but if you looked at my jars the

1362
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,880
devil's sat there for a long period of

1363
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,099
time and the lights like went down real

1364
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,960
quick so it was always more it was more

1365
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:08,960
like a mild psychedelic for me like

1366
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,940
smoking uh Neville

1367
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,338
it could get in the way of your day

1368
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,740
yep for sure you know you could you know

1369
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:19,139
uh most weed I can smoke and it enhances

1370
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:20,879
my day but you know there's some wheat

1371
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:22,920
and Haze is one of them that can alter

1372
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,440
your day and send you on a completely

1373
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,380
different path than you were on before

1374
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,358
it's crazy when you get not so or Tom

1375
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,640
Hill talking Hayes you could get them

1376
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:36,119
doing this for hours at a time waxing

1377
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:38,279
poetic endlessly about Haze I mean the

1378
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,619
real life change I'll say this right so

1379
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,560
that at that point I've been going to

1380
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,358
Amsterdam for four or five years at that

1381
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:48,358
point uh generally at least once or

1382
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:50,098
twice a year and most of the stuff that

1383
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:52,139
I got was not that great I went through

1384
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,940
a lot of stuff and I tossed a lot of

1385
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:56,279
stuff some of the hybrids I made with

1386
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,559
some of the American stuff I had ended

1387
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:02,640
up much better and I kind of had this

1388
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,440
opinion that you know uh what we had was

1389
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:07,679
clearly Superior

1390
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,000
uh and then uh you know those hazes some

1391
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,159
of those Haze hybrids that they have

1392
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,139
over there that was the first thing

1393
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,440
where all of a sudden I was like maybe

1394
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:18,598
these Old-Timers Tales of like soaring

1395
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,818
psychedelic Colombian that you get

1396
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,220
tracers in your vision and you're giggly

1397
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,719
and you have a hard time walking which I

1398
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,219
kind of thought was [ __ ] up till

1399
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,719
that point

1400
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:28,919
um all of a sudden I was like oh it's

1401
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:30,899
real

1402
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,380
it might be rare

1403
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:36,180
you know but it's real I've literally

1404
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,980
chased that High ever since I've had it

1405
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:39,598
you know the first time experiencing

1406
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,699
that I think that's common with a lot of

1407
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,500
people you know and so psychedelic

1408
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:45,118
experience and that well some for some

1409
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,300
people too it makes them want to crawl

1410
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,640
out of their skin yeah yeah like it's

1411
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,700
not it it it's it's almost like a

1412
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:56,879
disassociative very uncomfortable like

1413
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:59,159
not used to it type of type of high so

1414
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,260
it's it's interesting in that regarding

1415
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,719
experience started out with the roller

1416
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,700
coaster paranoia and by the end of the

1417
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:07,199
high is when the visual elements were

1418
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:09,719
started turning into a clear-headed

1419
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:12,299
where you could see tracers that that is

1420
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:13,739
just a whole nother experience uh so

1421
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,200
that's just what that's that's why it

1422
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:18,358
sticks with me because like like uh like

1423
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,358
direwolf was saying like he's got an

1424
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:23,219
unflappable buddy that like would would

1425
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:24,960
almost never give praise and then the

1426
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:27,358
guy smokes a joint and doesn't want to

1427
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,119
use a ladder for hours I could honestly

1428
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,558
say he's never given praise ever except

1429
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:33,440
for the Neville's days that's the only

1430
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:35,579
time I've ever seen anything

1431
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,619
that's funny

1432
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,140
yeah so that I always like that story

1433
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:42,960
you know because he was like oh no

1434
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:44,460
no no no ladder I'm just gonna sit right

1435
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,199
here while I'm safe

1436
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,240
so one thing that didn't make it over

1437
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:49,799
into the US a lot that I that I

1438
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,598
personally am always interested about

1439
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,099
whenever I have anyone any of my

1440
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,000
Canadian friends I like talking about a

1441
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,920
little bit

1442
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,739
are the hash plants that made their way

1443
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,000
through uh Canada like the Renee the

1444
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:01,858
champagne

1445
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,318
there were some other biker ones if I

1446
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:06,659
remember correctly uh that were popular

1447
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,818
do you have much experience with those

1448
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:10,440
uh not a ton so I actually I actually

1449
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:12,300
just put coincidence just picked up the

1450
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,039
Renee cut off a friend of mine last week

1451
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,780
but I've never actually tried it I've

1452
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:17,579
heard pretty mixed reviews on that but

1453
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,900
it's it's got to be one of the that's I

1454
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,660
was just talking to my friend about that

1455
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:25,318
when I got those like it's been around

1456
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:27,659
since at least like 93 or something like

1457
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,400
that so people like not a lot of stuff

1458
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:30,719
that gets held around that long but

1459
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,858
there's definitely a lot of people like

1460
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,358
my friends like I didn't think it was

1461
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:34,558
that good I heard from Arrow say he

1462
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,119
didn't think it was that good I don't

1463
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,859
know I never tried it the other ones

1464
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:40,019
were kind of so that was basically from

1465
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:42,539
what I can tell yeah that was like a

1466
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:45,059
group of bikers and those were kind of

1467
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:47,039
their Elite biker cats

1468
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,720
um like for sure so the story is and

1469
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,699
again all this gets highly this is

1470
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,699
reefer man enters the picture so stuff

1471
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:55,739
gets a little uh it's hard to it's hard

1472
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:58,858
to separate facts from fiction because

1473
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:00,959
you're very Adept at mixing the that's

1474
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:03,179
what I always dislike about people like

1475
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,519
reefer man is he actually has a ton of

1476
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:07,679
great information oh it's just mixes

1477
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:11,280
mixes it with a ton of [ __ ] so you

1478
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,779
never know what's real so he any so

1479
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,519
anyways the story that he has which

1480
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,980
seems to kind of play out is there's

1481
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:20,039
kind of like a group of bikers

1482
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,099
um out on Vancouver Island that we're

1483
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:26,119
doing a lot of of runs back then from

1484
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:29,760
seed and the story is that it was import

1485
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:33,480
it was seed from import which I find

1486
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,920
hard to Envision but I guess maybe I've

1487
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,659
heard a bunch of different stories but

1488
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,700
definitely I think they all for sure

1489
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:40,739
came out of like kind of either

1490
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:43,500
Vancouver Island or north of Vancouver

1491
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:46,379
or somewhere on Coastal BC and I think

1492
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,599
almost all of those came from the same

1493
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,640
group there was like champagne that's

1494
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:53,818
when the ancestors of like pink Kush

1495
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:57,179
which was like King uh Queen there was

1496
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:59,099
one called Jiffy pot maybe even that God

1497
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:01,019
bud I think they all came out of the

1498
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:05,160
same group

1499
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:08,280
um and yeah like champagne I only saw it

1500
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,960
and I've never grown it I've had it in

1501
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,519
flower form a couple times and it was

1502
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,500
really early like I remember like it was

1503
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,519
like 93 or something like that when I

1504
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,019
went through and it was there was

1505
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:18,659
nothing else like it like it was super

1506
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:20,039
high-end yeah for the time I don't think

1507
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:23,699
it's anything like super special it's

1508
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:25,858
just like a really nice hash plant

1509
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:28,618
but a lot of the Canadian ones are kind

1510
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:30,779
of based around those that kind of group

1511
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:32,358
like if you look at like the Special K

1512
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,880
pink Kush

1513
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:37,679
King's cross it used to be

1514
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,720
um there's a bunch of them that all

1515
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,639
they're kind of similar and it's kind of

1516
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:43,739
got a little bit obscured because what

1517
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:46,199
reefer man did is he CR he took that

1518
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,899
King cut which was one of the little

1519
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:50,460
legit Emoji like original ones yeah and

1520
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,200
he crossed it with a whole bunch of

1521
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,240
different stuff so he crossed it with

1522
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:55,679
like a lot of like modern U.S stuff

1523
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,739
don't hold me to this but I think it was

1524
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:01,919
like MK officer which is like an OG G13

1525
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:05,098
cross he crossed it with I think uh San

1526
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,200
Fernando Valley OG seed line and a few

1527
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:09,660
other things and if you look at it now

1528
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,519
it's like I don't know is it real so

1529
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:13,318
what goes around is so pink Kush

1530
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,599
everyone is like oh that's the old King

1531
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:17,759
cut but yeah I don't think it's actually

1532
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,800
necessarily the king cut it's like it's

1533
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,780
crosses with the old King cut to Modern

1534
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,240
cush varieties and if I had to leave

1535
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,260
bets it's probably leans heavier towards

1536
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,598
like

1537
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,740
modern Kush varieties than the king but

1538
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,780
I don't know I've never grown the

1539
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,419
original one but uh they were definitely

1540
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,579
some of the seeds the king seeds and I

1541
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:37,500
think uh when I was going to do a collab

1542
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:40,019
with why yeast and compound before I

1543
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,519
knew much about uh compound he ended up

1544
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:43,980
with them so somewhere there are King

1545
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,199
seeds still in existence don't know if

1546
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,818
they're a cross though The White Buffalo

1547
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,338
guys still definitely hold it like I've

1548
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:52,318
tried to fill out hybrids out of it um

1549
00:55:50,338 --> 00:55:53,940
they definitely have a lot of those old

1550
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,699
Cuts still like they definitely have the

1551
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:59,099
king but I know they've said they've

1552
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:01,019
told me or said to my buddy that uh

1553
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:02,579
they're like the pink Kush that goes

1554
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:04,079
around now doesn't look anything like

1555
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:05,400
the king that they hold and I mean he

1556
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,318
used to be partners with reframes I'm

1557
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,420
sure he has the original King oh yeah

1558
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:11,159
I'm sure yeah he did a lot of that early

1559
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,039
work for reefer man butterscotch

1560
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,358
Hawaiian which I I ended up liking a lot

1561
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,980
um I know reefer man always talked it

1562
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:18,358
down but I loved it

1563
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,079
did you ever get to try that one over

1564
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:21,358
there

1565
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:23,339
I generally if I did not I generally

1566
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,199
avoided anything to do with reefer man

1567
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:27,960
I'm sure he had good stuff he's just one

1568
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:30,480
of those people that just I just I just

1569
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,460
his his Aura just passes through

1570
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,019
anything he touches for me and I just

1571
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,818
don't want anything to do with it I can

1572
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:37,199
appreciate that for sure like you know

1573
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:39,599
there's a lot of lines like that that I

1574
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,098
didn't touch because of just the juju

1575
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,318
associated with it you know you never

1576
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:45,240
know some people have bad juju that just

1577
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:47,039
flows through everything they touch I

1578
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:49,379
mean you know it's an issue in cannabis

1579
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,719
because a lot of the people that end up

1580
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,660
doing a lot of work uh you start digging

1581
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:56,639
into them and you're like oh man like we

1582
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:57,960
really attract our community attracts a

1583
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,420
lot of quirky

1584
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,920
and some of that quirky is just quirky

1585
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,700
and some of that quirky is like you're

1586
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,740
like oh man yeah that's not that cool uh

1587
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:10,980
depending on your perspective

1588
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:12,838
um but it uh you know one of the things

1589
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,300
direwolf that like I don't know if you

1590
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:17,880
talked about this on the the thing you

1591
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,800
just did but Matt and I we sort of had

1592
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,420
this this gig where we were doing like

1593
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,740
sort of like the histories of the seed

1594
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,019
banks and stuff

1595
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:27,479
and we were gonna do some stuff on

1596
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:29,039
Canada and we ended up just not doing it

1597
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,260
because we both realized that neither

1598
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:34,380
one of us had enough of a base of actual

1599
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,839
information in history to like do it any

1600
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,358
justice you know

1601
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:40,980
um the characters involved all that I

1602
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:42,598
mean Canada is definitely sort of what I

1603
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,400
consider to be like the third wave of

1604
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:47,099
seed banks

1605
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,318
um you know uh not not just in terms of

1606
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,720
like seed Brokers

1607
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:54,659
um but you know just whole groups of

1608
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:57,299
people all of a sudden coming up with

1609
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:59,338
um you know seed banks themselves and

1610
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,318
blends of their own stuff and blends of

1611
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:03,960
European stuff and there was a lot of

1612
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:05,900
that around for a while it almost it was

1613
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,400
dominated

1614
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:11,099
for a while it did dominate for a while

1615
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:14,818
for sure you know Federation

1616
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:16,920
uh you know reefer man uh was it Joey

1617
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:19,259
you know the islands

1618
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,358
um there was a lot there was a lot of

1619
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,099
yeah people up there the one thing I

1620
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:24,900
would say about that that I think gets a

1621
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,700
little bit skewed and not it's not

1622
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,079
necessarily a bad way but although I

1623
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:30,960
would say

1624
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,460
all pretty much entirely the history of

1625
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,199
kind of what was coming out of cannabis

1626
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,920
comes from a handful of people it comes

1627
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:41,818
from Chimera breeder Steve red from

1628
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,318
Legends and reefer man yeah and maybe

1629
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,599
I'm maybe mixing a couple but I mean

1630
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,058
keep in mind those guys minus the reefer

1631
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,619
man like red Chimera breeder Steve they

1632
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:50,760
are all from like the same crew so what

1633
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:51,960
they're talking about when they talk

1634
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,640
about all this stuff I'm like that

1635
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,900
wasn't what was they you know you listen

1636
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:57,358
to them and you're like everyone was

1637
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,639
growing you know sweet tooth and

1638
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:02,219
whatever they were doing Legends

1639
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:04,379
ultimate indica and I'm like in my crowd

1640
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:06,539
and I said some of my friends were

1641
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:08,940
pretty big rollers

1642
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:09,838
they weren't the only people that I was

1643
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,920
the only one that knew anything about

1644
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,358
that and I learned about it from the

1645
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,639
internet not from what was going on in

1646
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:16,739
Canada and I think that gets a little

1647
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,358
bit skewed where I think they definitely

1648
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:20,939
were like a representative of what was

1649
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:22,980
going on but it that was definitely it

1650
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:25,380
was definitely far more diverse than it

1651
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,639
sounds coming from those guys and I'm

1652
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,780
not saying they're being self-serving it

1653
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:29,159
or anything I don't think they are I

1654
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,740
just think they're just telling their

1655
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:34,078
story and yeah it was a small segment of

1656
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:36,000
what was going on and the other big

1657
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,619
thing there like I said is that divide

1658
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,480
where they're all talking about what

1659
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,760
kind of was going on in Lower Mainland

1660
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,338
BC which is like the Vancouver area or

1661
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,440
also Vancouver Island where that other

1662
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:47,578
kind of can which there is definitely a

1663
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,980
lot of growing there that's where the

1664
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:52,680
most of the population is but that

1665
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,900
Kootenai Nelson area has always been

1666
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:58,139
like the real bread and butter of like

1667
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,880
the that's our humble and uh and what

1668
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:01,980
was going on there still to this day

1669
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,358
whatever's going like you go like on the

1670
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,280
coast it's all like everyone's growing

1671
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,380
pink Kush pink cushions been dominating

1672
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,720
that scene for like a decade and then

1673
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,220
you go to the Kootenays nobody grows

1674
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,078
pink Kush they're all growing whatever

1675
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:15,719
something totally different like it's a

1676
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:17,940
tote and that breeder Steve Camara crowd

1677
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:20,459
was really like a coast a Vancouver kind

1678
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:22,200
of based group and then so there's other

1679
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:24,599
groups um that were totally different

1680
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:26,578
they were based out of the cooties but

1681
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,200
if you go back to those you're talking

1682
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:29,519
about all those can most of those I

1683
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:31,139
think pretty much all those Canadian

1684
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,480
seed companies they were all

1685
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:35,879
from Mark Emery like yeah they were all

1686
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,619
getting offered through him yeah

1687
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,440
yeah and I think there's definitely like

1688
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:42,059
I think that Federation Next Generation

1689
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,559
the Federation turned into next

1690
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:45,240
generation and that next Generation

1691
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:46,640
guy's still around I've never met him

1692
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:48,959
but I think that guy gets

1693
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,639
underrepresented and like he's still

1694
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,699
like he was one of the most of those

1695
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:55,259
Romulan genetics I would I would argue

1696
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:57,118
all of the Ronald and genetics going

1697
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:01,740
around in the U.S probably came from

1698
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:03,420
Next Generation and Federation seeds

1699
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:05,519
but a lot of those ones that went

1700
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,139
through Emery were kind of just like not

1701
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,119
I mean that's how those guys got started

1702
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:10,618
it was like it was just knock offs of

1703
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,599
knockoffs like yep I think they

1704
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:14,579
basically started as they were working

1705
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,380
with breeder Steve and and with a bunch

1706
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,720
of reader Steve genetics so they started

1707
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:21,420
I don't know what the story was but uh

1708
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:23,338
that's definitely Federation had a lot

1709
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,559
it was a lot of like grapefruit and

1710
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:27,779
sweet skunk and the stuff that Steve was

1711
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,160
working with I definitely but I think

1712
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,720
they did some real work and they brought

1713
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:33,118
some other stuff like they were doing

1714
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:35,219
UBC chemo which is kind of a unique one

1715
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,760
and there's some other ones like Berlin

1716
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:40,139
and some like kind of more BC Centric

1717
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,700
ones I'm trying to think who the other

1718
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:43,379
ones Jordan of the island is still

1719
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:45,419
around I've never heard do you remember

1720
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,280
BC do you remember a company called BC

1721
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,760
grown

1722
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,400
uh I do not it was like I remember that

1723
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,900
one um it was early early to mid 2000s

1724
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,039
it was a dude named Jordan who ran it

1725
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,780
and I've always tried to figure out if

1726
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:00,239
that was Jordan from the same person

1727
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,798
yeah because it was it was a lot of the

1728
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:03,659
same stuff a lot of the Gaga and stuff

1729
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,838
like that because I just you know I I I

1730
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:09,298
come from an era where like uh you know

1731
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:11,759
basically like all those waves

1732
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:14,039
you know um I can't tell you how many

1733
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,280
times I read Neville's catalogs or

1734
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:19,858
senses catalogs or the Dutch catalogs or

1735
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,298
all the stuff in cannabis culture you

1736
01:02:19,858 --> 01:02:23,039
know all the various stuff that Mark

1737
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:25,679
Emery would sell from the various seed

1738
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,420
companies and their descriptions

1739
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:29,879
um because there wasn't obviously like

1740
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,559
there wasn't there wasn't internet you

1741
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,838
know so much and there wasn't like a

1742
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:37,019
vibrant clone trading community and it

1743
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:38,639
was all very tight in your circles and

1744
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:42,298
so if you wanted stuff outside your

1745
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:45,358
circle you would peruse the seed lists

1746
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:47,940
and see what sounded cool

1747
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,920
yeah for sure and I the one thing I will

1748
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,720
say that in my opinion came out of that

1749
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,599
scene I I couldn't prove it but I would

1750
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:56,818
lay bats that it did was

1751
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:58,680
um the auto I honestly think the auto

1752
01:02:56,818 --> 01:03:00,719
flowers all came out of Canadian

1753
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:03,480
genetics so if you look at the sequence

1754
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:05,338
of events this is one that uh maybe a

1755
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,318
little bit biased too because I was kind

1756
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:10,380
of close to a lot of parts of it but

1757
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:11,400
there was originally there was that much

1758
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,920
which you guys probably heard that

1759
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:17,338
Mighty Mite strain was kind of oh yeah

1760
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,599
and mighty might was um it came from one

1761
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:20,818
of the gulf Islands which is one of the

1762
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:23,338
little Islands between between just off

1763
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:25,980
the coast of BC it was kind of that area

1764
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:28,139
had a lot of like draft Dodgers and like

1765
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,480
kind of Dropout people would kind of go

1766
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:32,639
live on those islands and it is actually

1767
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,760
a guy that I know his dad is group that

1768
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,798
was growing that and who knows if if

1769
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,079
what it actually was it supposedly like

1770
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:42,059
a Himalayan and it's like this really

1771
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:45,420
it's like got a really big really Indica

1772
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:48,900
really strong central Cola and some of

1773
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:50,940
the fenos would go off automatically and

1774
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,280
if you traced by in Canada anyways if

1775
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,900
you trace back pretty much every time

1776
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,900
somebody's like talking about some super

1777
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,099
early strain most of them come back to

1778
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,180
my email you can just it's one of those

1779
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:01,440
ones you can just look at it you're like

1780
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:02,879
that's not right you might end it I had

1781
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,460
a friend of mine sent me a picture a

1782
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,680
couple years ago he's like some

1783
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:10,760
acclimated Thai strain he had he's been

1784
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,759
passed down to the generations

1785
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:18,960
um but my uh my old partner used to do a

1786
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,000
lot of uh so kind of I think where that

1787
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,818
got popularized is

1788
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,940
um in Mark Emery was sound on some seeds

1789
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:28,500
of it and at the time

1790
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:31,619
my well partner was doing these crazy

1791
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,659
grows of it they had up in Northern

1792
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:35,760
Ontario they were like living up in this

1793
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:37,199
Cottage and they had and so that was

1794
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,319
back then you could sell outdoor really

1795
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:43,858
easily and uh they were doing these

1796
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:46,259
crazy outdoors in these swamps and uh

1797
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:48,058
and it was all it was kind of like I

1798
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,319
almost describe it as a land race so

1799
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:51,298
they were kind of back and forth between

1800
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,920
that Nelson area and BC so they'd kind

1801
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:54,960
of have like the best outdoor stuff that

1802
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,280
was going around Nelson and they were

1803
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,139
crossing it all with their own stuff

1804
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,460
which was all pretty Mighty might and it

1805
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:02,818
would go off really early like you'd

1806
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:04,440
start harvesting in like July and uh

1807
01:05:02,818 --> 01:05:05,639
not all of it but it was like it was

1808
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,159
kind of like a land race so they would

1809
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:10,440
they would pop like you know 1500 or 2

1810
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:13,618
000 seats and grow them out in all these

1811
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:15,358
swamps all over the place and uh and

1812
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:16,858
they basically start harvesting like

1813
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:18,000
July the first ones would come and

1814
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:19,739
they'd go all the way into like the

1815
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,480
first week of October it was just like

1816
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:23,399
very that's why I kind of call it it's

1817
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,559
like a Canadian land race because it was

1818
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,480
just pretty diverse and some of them

1819
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:29,160
were really good and you could never get

1820
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,480
away with it then because you sell bags

1821
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:31,920
of it I remember one of my buddies used

1822
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,119
to wholesale bags and he's like I can't

1823
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,798
take any more of this stuff he's like

1824
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,420
one guy tells me how great it is and the

1825
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:37,920
next guy's telling me it like doesn't do

1826
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,720
anything and it was because it was all

1827
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,280
from seed and some of it was the

1828
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:44,459
Autoflower stuff that wasn't that strong

1829
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:48,298
but that anyway so at the time that was

1830
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:49,858
when I was writing for uh uh cannabis

1831
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:50,818
called so Mark Emery's magazine I was

1832
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:52,679
writing for the Cannabis Culture

1833
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:55,318
magazine and I wrote an article about

1834
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:56,399
Auto flowers because at the time I found

1835
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:58,858
it frustrating because there was

1836
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,900
definitely like some not like super good

1837
01:05:58,858 --> 01:06:02,460
autoflowers but like decent quality like

1838
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:05,700
flour for the time like you could sell

1839
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:08,579
it sale no problem and so I wrote an

1840
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:11,460
article about uh Auto flowers and it

1841
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:12,900
focused a lot on Mighty might and at the

1842
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,818
time there was literally not a single

1843
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,260
Autoflower on the market other than a

1844
01:06:14,818 --> 01:06:18,179
few of those Mighty Mites coming out of

1845
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,260
Markham recedes like other than that I

1846
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:20,639
don't think a single thing had been

1847
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,619
released since Neville released those

1848
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:23,879
first ones like back in the 80s well I

1849
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:25,798
guess sorry stencies still would have

1850
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:29,059
had that their crappy whatever it was

1851
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:31,920
called that nobody bought

1852
01:06:29,059 --> 01:06:34,680
yeah ruderalis skunk and Rooter Alice

1853
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,940
and out and I was kind of frustrated

1854
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:37,798
because I was like no like this is

1855
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:39,900
actually has potential the Autoflower

1856
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:43,380
stuff so I wrote that vertical about it

1857
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:45,000
and it was like within a year that all

1858
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,240
of a sudden you started that was kind of

1859
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,039
when I think the low rider came off

1860
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:52,078
and then and then Europe all started

1861
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:54,119
doing Auto flowers and then I don't ever

1862
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,579
bother with them but they yeah they all

1863
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:59,400
it became a big thing I honestly think I

1864
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:00,780
lay back if you trace that back whether

1865
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,280
it came from mighty might or something

1866
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,619
else I would lay bats that came out of

1867
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,298
Canadian genetics because we are the

1868
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:08,519
only people really doing it much back

1869
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:10,798
then maybe I'm wrong but I I'm pretty

1870
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:13,739
certain that the timing all made sense

1871
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,480
what didn't make sense to me was if I

1872
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:17,159
remember correctly lowrider the dude a

1873
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,420
joint doctor or whoever was the one that

1874
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:20,219
was originally saying they bred it they

1875
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:22,500
said it was from a Mexican just random

1876
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:24,480
Mexican it's like I don't know you know

1877
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,699
like because my I remember growing early

1878
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,380
sativa from Canadian bread seeds and

1879
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:29,639
there were a few other ones and they

1880
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,318
were definitely they definitely had some

1881
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:32,940
good autoflowering traits back then and

1882
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:35,279
there wasn't a lot being marketed at the

1883
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:37,380
time for autoflowering one thing that's

1884
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,380
been pretty consistent in weed is

1885
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:44,180
obscuring the origin of where your stuff

1886
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,960
came from for a variety for a certain

1887
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:46,739
you know

1888
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,119
um

1889
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:50,179
that's one of the more disappointing

1890
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:53,280
things of wheat is when I've kind of

1891
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:54,298
like I travel a lot through Canada so I

1892
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,680
kind of

1893
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:58,019
um like just for work I've always

1894
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,159
traveled a lot and I've so I just know a

1895
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:01,739
lot of different people and I've always

1896
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:04,139
kind of chased genetics a little bit and

1897
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:05,759
whatever just when you and when you dig

1898
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:08,159
into pretty much everything you're just

1899
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,520
like oh it's just like another seed bank

1900
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:14,159
strain or it's just yeah renamed M39 or

1901
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,439
like you there's so I can literally

1902
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:18,479
count on like one hand how many like

1903
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:21,178
Elite things or stuff that have a great

1904
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:23,939
story that when you dig into them aren't

1905
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:27,719
are anything actual unusual

1906
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:29,219
yeah that's that's typically it you know

1907
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:32,460
um and especially once you get past a

1908
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:34,500
certain point in the Years too it gets

1909
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,698
much worse you know when you're starting

1910
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,619
to realize that you're buying everything

1911
01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:39,419
comes from one Spanish Seed Company

1912
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:42,000
During certain years you know that if

1913
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,859
you're buying Dutch stuff and it it did

1914
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,539
take a big change

1915
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:48,298
um and it's gotten much worse over the

1916
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:49,500
years so you know I guess that's why a

1917
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:50,759
lot of us are still chasing some of

1918
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,738
these old ones it's not necessarily

1919
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:55,079
because we think they're more dank but

1920
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:57,238
the the genetic diversity is a lot

1921
01:08:55,079 --> 01:08:58,738
better than just gelato times gelato or

1922
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:00,539
cookies times cookies times cookies not

1923
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:01,738
cookies or whatever time to get back

1924
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:03,539
yeah for sure

1925
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:05,278
and there was definitely some stuff when

1926
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:07,679
I think back that this was really unique

1927
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,500
compared to what's around whether people

1928
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,060
would actually care that much

1929
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,380
these days I don't know but it was

1930
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,539
definitely

1931
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:18,659
um unique

1932
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:21,060
yeah I think I really don't it's a place

1933
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:22,198
pardon me unique definitely has a place

1934
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,819
now I think

1935
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:24,899
um at least among some circles that are

1936
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:26,880
left

1937
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:28,318
when I think of what's actually that

1938
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,940
I've tried That's Unique over the years

1939
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:34,080
it's always and I'm not like a big

1940
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:36,059
sativa you know dude but it's usually

1941
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,859
sativa stuff it's like more equatorial

1942
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:39,839
stuff that's kind of distinct like when

1943
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:42,719
I think back to like growing up it was

1944
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,399
like the Jamaican was kind of the

1945
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,039
Jamaican import we'd always get was

1946
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,000
definitely like pretty unique

1947
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,100
um

1948
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,899
okay but this is kind of stuff like that

1949
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,060
it's like I think a lot of the cushes

1950
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:55,500
and indicas are pretty similar I I don't

1951
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,880
know I'm certainly somewhere in

1952
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,399
Afghanistan there's some different stuff

1953
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:03,239
but everything I've really tried in that

1954
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:05,939
realm all seems pretty similar

1955
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:07,859
so uh in that regard I mean and maybe

1956
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:10,979
some of that too is just because sativas

1957
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:12,719
are the rarest thing to get worked uh

1958
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:15,839
because indicas are definitely like

1959
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,760
easier to grow and they're shorter and

1960
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,640
they're thicker and they yield more and

1961
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,039
they're more prone for INS

1962
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,619
um so they kind of a lot of sativas sort

1963
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:28,319
of missed like this inbreeding era of

1964
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:30,059
the last 20 plus years I think you know

1965
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,679
they weren't they weren't as as big of a

1966
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,440
proponent of all that

1967
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,359
where yeah it's it's pretty noticeable I

1968
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:38,339
have one of my best friends grows at it

1969
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:40,559
I would argue probably more sativas than

1970
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,940
almost anyone like in North America like

1971
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,640
he's just a hobby yeah but he's just

1972
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:46,559
always like he pops I bet he probably

1973
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,960
pops like a couple of thousand seeds a

1974
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:52,380
year of all like land race or

1975
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,600
whatever all the ties so I try a lot of

1976
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:57,239
stuff from him and it's really

1977
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:59,159
noticeable it's just how like unimproved

1978
01:10:57,238 --> 01:11:00,419
it is like it's just like it a lot of it

1979
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:02,759
I'm like oh that totally has like

1980
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,739
potential but it's just like when you

1981
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,539
really think of like it's just really

1982
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:08,519
unworked and it's just like doesn't have

1983
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:10,319
like it's just there's a lot of things

1984
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:12,239
missing and you're like well man if

1985
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,460
somebody worked on this for 30 years

1986
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:15,779
which is Big you know it's at least that

1987
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,880
what a lot of those cushions have been

1988
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:19,380
worked on who knows what crazy stuff

1989
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,260
they can come out of them but I just

1990
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:24,000
find it's pretty unworked because I try

1991
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:26,820
a lot of stuff from him and not very

1992
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,738
much of it is very appealing

1993
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:31,198
yeah cannabis doesn't breed itself

1994
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:34,799
naturally towards like getting humans

1995
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:36,119
High the best as we've seen you know it

1996
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,179
tends to like try to breed itself

1997
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:40,439
towards happiness uh so it makes a lot

1998
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:41,579
of sense and I think a lot you know

1999
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:43,559
there's a there's a big land race

2000
01:11:41,579 --> 01:11:45,840
heirloom collection Community you'll see

2001
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,699
it on IG you know like the uh people

2002
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,980
offering you know strains directly from

2003
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:52,139
Afghanistan and Pakistan and and that's

2004
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:54,000
great but I I don't know that the the

2005
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:55,500
larger community in general understands

2006
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,840
what getting into land races and

2007
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,760
heirloom lines truly means and the kind

2008
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,340
of space you need to to truly pick

2009
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,739
something wonderful out that that many

2010
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:07,579
people would enjoy you know it's it's a

2011
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:07,579
much bigger process

2012
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:15,000
younger people don't get is like I'm

2013
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:18,658
like I've grown up some land races but

2014
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,738
even like if you look back to book stuff

2015
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:21,839
um

2016
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:23,879
to be around even if it's been to

2017
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,319
decayed like if you go back to a lot of

2018
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,859
the seats

2019
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:30,479
horrible Keepers out of packs like yeah

2020
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:32,639
there was some great stuff that came out

2021
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,559
of that but the consistency these days

2022
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,060
like you can buy most of the modern

2023
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,440
stuff like you could buy a pack of

2024
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,840
almost anything I'd find like something

2025
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,299
great out of 10 seeds and I think that

2026
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,520
was not the case back a long time you

2027
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:47,100
know in pretty recent history even when

2028
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,679
I go through that that Suites gun clone

2029
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,480
that I grow out a lot of and uh that was

2030
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:55,679
basically like I'm pretty sure it's just

2031
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:57,779
a plain old NL AC and if you pop like

2032
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,060
hybrids of that and you see like a lot

2033
01:12:57,779 --> 01:13:01,319
of like the old nl5 Expressions which

2034
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,820
everyone always talks with how great

2035
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:06,420
they are I mean they were horrible they

2036
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:09,119
were super betrayed as susceptible

2037
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,980
um it definitely has some nice stuff in

2038
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,079
there but I'm like I don't remember like

2039
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:14,639
the last time I popped like a pack of

2040
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:17,219
modern seeds and got something like

2041
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,320
rotted out on the you know on the stem

2042
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:22,140
under normal grow room conditions but

2043
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:25,139
that was pretty common back then yeah oh

2044
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:27,360
I definitely think that uh I talk about

2045
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:31,320
it quite a bit like the difference

2046
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:34,619
between like a a low

2047
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:38,759
oh can you hear Francis

2048
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:41,279
no it's all Frozen okay so we'll uh

2049
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,600
probably pause it for a second until he

2050
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,639
comes back since he's in the middle of

2051
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,980
something and then I'll cut it there he

2052
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,179
is my connection has been cutting in and

2053
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:49,738
out Strangely I don't know what to do

2054
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:54,420
okay leave a few seconds before you jump

2055
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:57,299
back in so I can edit it one two three

2056
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:59,039
so I I've definitely noticed that like a

2057
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,980
lot of the original strains you could

2058
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:04,260
find real gems in it but it did take a

2059
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:06,419
lot of hunting and a lot of work and I'm

2060
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:09,239
not sure that like the modern seed

2061
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:11,760
poppers would be comfortable going

2062
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:13,379
through stuff that had so much junk and

2063
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,940
mids

2064
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:17,760
I mean why would they find the right

2065
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:19,559
thing yeah you don't have to spend that

2066
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,739
time or space anymore to find something

2067
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:25,199
that that fills that modern market like

2068
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:26,879
that that palette so it's it's it's a

2069
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:29,279
lot to go out of ask someone to go out

2070
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,100
of their way to do these massive pops it

2071
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:33,779
costs money time and space

2072
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,860
and it's harder to sell now like back

2073
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:36,599
then you remember they could sell

2074
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:38,399
whatever whatever you popped out of that

2075
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,840
seed pack someone was lined up to buy it

2076
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:41,579
I mean I wouldn't want to try to be

2077
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,739
moving some of that stuff these days

2078
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:46,140
like it's I don't even know what you're

2079
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:49,698
doing to make extracts I guess but

2080
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,699
brownies and extracts

2081
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,060
so now that we're getting into we talked

2082
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:55,920
a little bit about botrytus on Buds and

2083
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:58,500
and some of the stuff there

2084
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,600
one of your Specialties is IPM and we

2085
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:03,479
really haven't covered a good IPM topic

2086
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,060
on on the show so I wanted to I wanted

2087
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:08,218
to go over some basic steps

2088
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:11,580
um and some of the practices that you do

2089
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:14,039
to to to keep your room clean to to

2090
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:16,640
really work on your IPM do you want to

2091
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:19,920
talk about some of your basics

2092
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,719
yeah so I kind of like I worked in the

2093
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,060
commercial Greenhouse industry for like

2094
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:25,380
a long time like I think 30 years or

2095
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:28,020
something and most a lot of what I've

2096
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:30,119
done is in integrated Pest Management so

2097
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:32,460
also I would say don't always take

2098
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:35,099
lessons from me on how to do stuff

2099
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:37,439
because because I work in that sometimes

2100
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,940
I go through stages where sometimes I'm

2101
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:41,219
like a super diseaseophobe and I'm like

2102
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:42,899
I don't want to take anything in and uh

2103
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:44,880
and other times I'm like whatever if I

2104
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:47,099
get something I want to I don't really

2105
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,079
care that much if I get something in

2106
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,280
because I want to like figure out like

2107
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:52,198
make sure I know what I'm talking about

2108
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,979
with getting rid of it

2109
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:56,039
um

2110
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,419
and the only ones that honestly out of

2111
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:59,340
all the ones that I see the ones that

2112
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:01,859
are just like really like the number one

2113
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:03,360
thing I say is just don't get it like

2114
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:05,219
yeah

2115
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,319
it's like that's the easiest thing like

2116
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:09,000
thrips and spider mites to me they're

2117
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:10,679
pretty easy to get rid of the ones that

2118
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,140
are just like

2119
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,719
they're they're disasters is like is I

2120
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:17,400
mean powder mildews per it's doable but

2121
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:18,840
it's for I mean it's anyone has had it

2122
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:20,759
it's pretty hard to shake especially if

2123
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,860
you've got a bigger operation

2124
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,380
um but the worst ones is uh cannabis

2125
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:27,599
aphid uh in Maroon aphid just because

2126
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,100
they're there's just unless you're gonna

2127
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,980
go with us and they're easy to get rid

2128
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:34,199
of with a synthetic like a systemic uh

2129
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:35,639
but if you're like legal and you can't

2130
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:37,979
do that or you don't want to do that

2131
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,840
they're essentially impossible to get

2132
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:41,218
rid of so I mean that and that's the one

2133
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,100
I always find so frustrating because

2134
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:45,359
people it's like they're you know aphids

2135
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,100
are big like you can see them you don't

2136
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,479
even need a handling like a magnifying

2137
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:51,900
glass you can see them with your naked

2138
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,399
eye and I I've seen I've personally seen

2139
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:56,519
multiple times for people have literally

2140
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:58,198
like brought in like some stupid clone

2141
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,239
it definitely wasn't worth the hassle

2142
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:01,738
and ended up with like you know

2143
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:03,359
something that cost them millions and

2144
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:05,579
millions of dollars and they basically

2145
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,339
it's never get rid of them

2146
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:10,079
um but I actually just had a recent one

2147
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:11,880
that I've kind of moving so I'm kind of

2148
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,100
shutting down all my because I'm not

2149
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,779
finishing up my flowering and I was like

2150
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:18,000
okay well I'm just holding mothers for

2151
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:19,319
like the next you know probably a year

2152
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,179
or something because I gotta you know

2153
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:22,979
sell my house and move and stuff so I'm

2154
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:24,539
like I'm gonna start catching some

2155
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:26,279
clones that people owe me or whatever

2156
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,899
Now's the Time I'll add them and then I

2157
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:31,859
don't really care whatever if somebody

2158
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:33,479
sticks me I got a year to clean it up

2159
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:35,880
and uh

2160
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:37,259
so I got I got and everyone's giving me

2161
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,880
a clone recently he's gonna be like oh

2162
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:40,140
that's me but because I'll tell everyone

2163
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,880
I've gotten a whole bunch of clothes

2164
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,739
from different people in the last month

2165
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:45,420
or so so it might not have any of it

2166
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:46,619
somebody gave me powdery mildew on one

2167
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:51,119
of them that they told me didn't have

2168
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:53,519
any and I had left them

2169
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:55,800
I I had gone traveling for two weeks I

2170
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,600
thought it was fine and I left it and

2171
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,400
then I went back I kind of left my wife

2172
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,980
in charge and I came back and that one

2173
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:04,079
clone had blown up and gone everywhere

2174
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:06,419
so now I got mildew everywhere so that

2175
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,219
one's fresh in my mind and that's the

2176
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:11,340
one that I think causes a lot of people

2177
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:12,960
a lot of uh there's a lot of they don't

2178
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:15,239
really understand what's going on there

2179
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,158
and I think they think it's systemic

2180
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:18,959
which is a chance it is but I think

2181
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:20,519
mostly what happens where you get it and

2182
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,020
they're like I just can't shake it it's

2183
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,760
just because once you get spores

2184
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,260
everywhere in your room they're

2185
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,719
basically impossible to get rid of like

2186
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,980
they last for years so I've seen I've

2187
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:30,539
seen that a bunch of times where people

2188
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:32,339
they think they've got it all under

2189
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,500
control and then bang like six months

2190
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,420
later PM starts up again and I think

2191
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,219
that's really it might have been that it

2192
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,260
was in some you know one of their plants

2193
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:41,579
just had a bit living on it that they

2194
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:43,860
didn't catch but I think a lot of times

2195
01:18:41,579 --> 01:18:45,658
it's just there's spores everywhere and

2196
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:47,880
sooner or later you kick up a Spore and

2197
01:18:45,658 --> 01:18:49,500
and it germinates on your plant and and

2198
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,500
bang you've got it but in that situation

2199
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:54,179
I believe that's it what had happened is

2200
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:58,800
that plant that I brought in from my

2201
01:18:54,179 --> 01:19:01,158
buddy had was covered in spores and the

2202
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:04,260
spores kind of you know they germinate

2203
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:05,819
on the plant and then they kind of have

2204
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:08,520
a little Tap Root that goes down into

2205
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:10,139
the plant that's called a historium that

2206
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:12,360
basically like it's kind of like roots

2207
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:15,239
for powdery mildew and it just like kind

2208
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:17,219
of sits there and it spreads like it's

2209
01:19:15,238 --> 01:19:19,379
mycelium kind of across the surface so

2210
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:21,600
it's growing on the leaf surface and

2211
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,520
then what triggers powdery mildew like

2212
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,159
what people notice is when this when it

2213
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,780
spores when it spoilates right and a lot

2214
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,819
of times what people think it's like a

2215
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:31,679
humidity thing but usually when it

2216
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:33,119
actually spoilates it's a stress event

2217
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,158
so it's either that's why you see it in

2218
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,658
like Peak flowering all sudden it'll go

2219
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:38,698
you'll see a whole room go off with

2220
01:19:36,658 --> 01:19:41,939
mildew you didn't think you had and in

2221
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:43,559
this case while I was traveling the you

2222
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:45,960
know in Canada usually when it switches

2223
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,300
from kind of Summer to fall it'll go

2224
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:50,760
from like 85 relative humidity on

2225
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:53,039
average down to like 35 when the cool

2226
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,600
when the Cool Front hits and that's what

2227
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,640
I think happens there's a cool front hit

2228
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,079
while I was traveling and bang this

2229
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,460
thing went off my wife didn't see it the

2230
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:03,119
next thing I know I've got mildew all

2231
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:04,920
over the all over the uh

2232
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:07,380
All Over the Garden but definitely like

2233
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:10,619
those ones so I I guess my biggest thing

2234
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:12,060
is I I'm usually pretty careful like

2235
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:13,920
definitely if I was running a commercial

2236
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:16,080
thing I would be way the heck more

2237
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,420
careful than pretty much everybody in

2238
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,859
what I bring in that's pretty much all

2239
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:22,859
the time where it comes from it's people

2240
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:25,859
importing clones and

2241
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:27,960
I mean the one that just really gets me

2242
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:29,579
it's it's the Cannabis Seafood

2243
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,960
especially like they're just so easy to

2244
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:33,059
see and I think especially if they're

2245
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,760
legal stuff people start bringing in

2246
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:38,940
like you know more cuttings at a time

2247
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,280
than they can look through yeah properly

2248
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:44,158
and then it only takes one aphid and

2249
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:46,019
then you you know like one cannabis

2250
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:48,000
aphid in three weeks can take down like

2251
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:50,699
a whole garden basically like it really

2252
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:54,359
they reproduce that quickly for the for

2253
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:56,158
the PM what what in Canada I you know

2254
01:20:54,359 --> 01:20:58,259
because I know down here like our crew

2255
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:00,719
tends to use like micronized sulfur

2256
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,039
spray but I don't even know like in the

2257
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,719
legal Market if that's something they

2258
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:05,219
can even use up in Canada is that

2259
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:08,100
something you guys use there or do you

2260
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:09,539
have a different routine uh yeah so no

2261
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:12,060
they can use it so basically what

2262
01:21:09,539 --> 01:21:13,500
they're limited to and again because I I

2263
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,020
kind of work in both I've worked for a

2264
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,579
long time and also like commercial uh

2265
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,780
vegetables and Commercial flowers so

2266
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:19,859
I've been yeah I kind of know what's

2267
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:22,139
dealt with

2268
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:24,658
in general and what's different with

2269
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:27,300
cannabis is in any other crop it's

2270
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:30,359
always controlled by a combination of

2271
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:32,460
systemic fungicides and stuff like

2272
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:34,979
sulfur and you know potassium

2273
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:37,260
bicarbonate or like bacillus subtilis or

2274
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:40,139
stuff like some of the common things and

2275
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:41,520
what we've got stuck with in Canada good

2276
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,719
or bad and I don't really have a comment

2277
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,360
whether it's good or bad but it makes it

2278
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:47,880
challenging is there's there's no like

2279
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:50,039
systemic fungicides registered so

2280
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,579
basically once you take the systemic out

2281
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:55,380
you're just dealing with surface level

2282
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:58,380
uh other than sulfur maybe you're just

2283
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,760
dealing with surface level controls so

2284
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,640
for instance like you know people will

2285
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,199
use like uh I think Rhapsody is one like

2286
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,600
a bacillus septalus which is like a

2287
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:07,859
bacterial one yeah that people that's a

2288
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,600
common one I think they use on both

2289
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:11,399
sides of the border and it works great

2290
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,860
but it only controls like the surface

2291
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:15,719
level so it's and it so it's not

2292
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:17,819
controlling that historium that's down

2293
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:20,520
in that little root that's down into the

2294
01:22:17,819 --> 01:22:22,920
plant so basically you can can kill

2295
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,600
everything on the surface and then that

2296
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,219
little Roots is going to keep it's just

2297
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,719
you know a week later going to pop up

2298
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:30,119
and slowly spread again and you won't

2299
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:31,859
see it until it spoilates so basically

2300
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:36,079
what they're stuck with in any of the

2301
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:38,579
legal places is just spraying every week

2302
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:40,198
to keep them once you've got mildew in

2303
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,219
your facility they just spray every week

2304
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:43,379
with

2305
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:45,300
usually they rotate and they've got I

2306
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,659
think there's a hydrogen peroxide type

2307
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:51,060
spray there's a potassium bicarbonate

2308
01:22:48,658 --> 01:22:52,679
spray there's a couple of like oil type

2309
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:55,020
sprays which again these are all just

2310
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:57,539
ones that they're just like they control

2311
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,719
the surface level the only thing that

2312
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:02,819
really has any systemic effect is sulfur

2313
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,800
and that's one that people and I

2314
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:07,139
honestly don't know the real answer to

2315
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,880
this bubble I will say for sure all the

2316
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,100
cleanest Growers that I've seen in the

2317
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,600
legal Market use a lot of sulfur they

2318
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,219
use sulfur literally some of the music

2319
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,500
right they use sulfur pots right to

2320
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:19,020
harvest I'm not saying that's good or

2321
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,060
bad they will argue

2322
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,980
um I personally wouldn't use it that far

2323
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,860
they argue if you look at the sulfur

2324
01:23:22,979 --> 01:23:27,959
tests like the leaf uh like the tissue

2325
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:29,759
analysis sure

2326
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,619
there's still not enough sulfur in the

2327
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,060
plant that's their argument they're just

2328
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:34,859
like it's just a plant nutrient they're

2329
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:37,980
still not up to Optimal levels even with

2330
01:23:34,859 --> 01:23:39,599
the pots burning bubble men and I

2331
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,879
honestly just don't know which is true

2332
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,920
on this bubble you know a lot of people

2333
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,539
will say that the sulfur gets into and

2334
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,920
will destroy the flavor which I could

2335
01:23:45,539 --> 01:23:48,840
definitely see you know it's soft like

2336
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,880
it just gets into everything and Bubble

2337
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,920
Man back years ago he used to be the

2338
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,199
buyer at the Vancouver Compassion Club

2339
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:57,239
and that was this big thing was he would

2340
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,559
make hash with it and he could smell the

2341
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:01,678
salt tell whether somebody had used

2342
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,480
defender on their crop and I would say

2343
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,460
definitely some of that absent [ __ ]

2344
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:08,279
because I've literally smoked that guy

2345
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:10,619
that the one of the big LPS that I know

2346
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:13,920
for a fact runs it literally until

2347
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:16,140
Harvest day I bought some of their uh

2348
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,460
Pink Kush literally I know exactly what

2349
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:19,380
was done to it and I bought it from the

2350
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:21,658
legal store it was covered in Sulfur I

2351
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:24,600
couldn't do some anything yeah I don't

2352
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:27,299
know I personally obsess a little assess

2353
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,699
on it but sulfur is definitely like the

2354
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,560
most effective thing out of those and

2355
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:33,419
then what I find it kind of gets is a

2356
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:37,020
little bit dumb is like we had I think

2357
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:39,539
you guys did too the whole uh Michael

2358
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,280
butanal thing when it first went legal

2359
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:42,600
there's a few people's uh it's called

2360
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:43,800
Nova up here I can't remember what you

2361
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,520
guys call it

2362
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:49,380
um Eagle 20 Eagle 20. that's right so so

2363
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,760
a bunch of guys got caught using that

2364
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,260
and there's this whole thing about how

2365
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,780
it makes like some you know when you

2366
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:56,460
smoke Eagle 20 it makes this cyanide I

2367
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:58,439
think it was some some super toxic

2368
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,579
sounding thing but then if you look in

2369
01:24:58,439 --> 01:25:01,319
and I'm not telling people to go use

2370
01:24:59,579 --> 01:25:03,359
Eagle 20 today yeah I'm just saying I

2371
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:06,238
think it's been blown up a little a lot

2372
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:07,679
so if you look at like the the

2373
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:09,539
chemical that they were all talking

2374
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,980
about it was so bad well cannabis

2375
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:12,420
already produces it like a thousand

2376
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:14,039
times the level that was in the

2377
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:16,199
microbutanol

2378
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:17,640
um spray so I don't I'm not advocating

2379
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:19,139
when people use Michael but no I'm just

2380
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,900
saying that that is how it's controlled

2381
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:23,940
on other crops and sure I would argue

2382
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:26,219
like I personally wouldn't have a

2383
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:28,619
problem doing clones with microbutanol

2384
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:29,939
and like knowing like I personally

2385
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:32,099
wouldn't have a problem cleaning up

2386
01:25:29,939 --> 01:25:33,658
Mother's stock with mycobutinol I would

2387
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,699
never use it in flowering and stuff like

2388
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:37,439
that sure even though we eat it all the

2389
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:40,198
time like 100 of all your food's covered

2390
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,698
in this and stuff yeah so yeah we got

2391
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:42,899
some weird stuff there it's the same

2392
01:25:41,698 --> 01:25:45,238
kind of thing with aphids in Canada

2393
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:47,759
where it's really easy to get it I've

2394
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:50,519
seen both with micro butanol and with

2395
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:53,340
aphid uh systemic chemicals where I've

2396
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:55,440
seen people test clean pretty not that

2397
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:57,600
far after they've done that that

2398
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:59,219
application yeah yeah

2399
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,620
um and it literally makes like it's

2400
01:25:59,219 --> 01:26:02,698
literally with cannabis if it's it seems

2401
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:04,619
like one of those dumb things right

2402
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:06,779
seeing like these LPS that literally

2403
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:09,000
have spent like you know 13 million

2404
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:11,939
dollars on bio control for a year to

2405
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,738
control Canada to control cannabis aphid

2406
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:16,198
and they could have literally controlled

2407
01:26:13,738 --> 01:26:17,359
them with like one you know Endeavor

2408
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:19,799
treatment

2409
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:21,420
for like a penny or something like that

2410
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:24,480
it gets it seems like it's gotten a

2411
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:26,399
little bit crazy like it's like okay who

2412
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,439
who really cares if you test as long as

2413
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:29,579
it's tests clean do you really care

2414
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:31,439
whether somebody used it in their

2415
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:34,260
mother's dog so I'm kind of always a

2416
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:36,779
pretty big IPM I don't really believe in

2417
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:38,820
pure bio control or pure chemical what

2418
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:40,319
kind of believe in both I don't really

2419
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,698
see a big problem with a lot of some of

2420
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:43,019
that stuff if it's test if you're

2421
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:45,539
testing it and it's clean at the end of

2422
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:47,460
the day who cares so the issue with that

2423
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:49,560
with that what happens is any of those

2424
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,719
powdery mildew that's just a general

2425
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:53,340
issue with a lot of chemicals is stuff

2426
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:55,739
gets resistant to them really quick

2427
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:58,860
there he's back so I was just saying uh

2428
01:26:55,738 --> 01:27:00,479
not so like what so what happens with

2429
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:02,039
stuff like that is it's just when

2430
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:04,619
they're spraying it too frequently and

2431
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:06,060
it just gets resistant to it and what so

2432
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:09,059
Canada's got a lot more stringent

2433
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:11,100
pesticide laws than the US so we've kind

2434
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,739
of always used a lot more

2435
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,780
um you know bio control and like uh

2436
01:27:13,738 --> 01:27:17,939
micro

2437
01:27:14,779 --> 01:27:19,198
bio pesticides so that where they would

2438
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:21,299
use if you look at a conventional

2439
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:23,339
cucumber crop that gets a huge amount

2440
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:25,500
like way more mildew than the Cannabis

2441
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,940
crop gets they would always rotate so

2442
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:30,238
they'll sit there and they'll spray

2443
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:32,039
potassium bicarbonate or like these

2444
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:33,599
off stuff which you can't get rid of so

2445
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:36,779
you can't get results for you can't get

2446
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:39,239
resistant to potassium bicarbonate

2447
01:27:36,779 --> 01:27:40,979
um so they'll spray those every week and

2448
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:42,959
then every once in a while they'll throw

2449
01:27:40,979 --> 01:27:43,919
in a Nova that kind of just knocks the

2450
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,960
crap out of them and that's how they

2451
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,520
manage the resistance

2452
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,658
um same thing with bio controls like you

2453
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,480
were talking about you know your spider

2454
01:27:48,658 --> 01:27:54,359
reservites that's how a lot a lot of

2455
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:56,279
crops are just they use the bio controls

2456
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:58,019
to spread out how often they're going to

2457
01:27:56,279 --> 01:27:59,939
do the spray treatment just to keep them

2458
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:03,120
much more effective

2459
01:27:59,939 --> 01:28:04,799
I mean yeah in in Mendo as well 20 years

2460
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:07,198
ago you could spread people would use

2461
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:09,000
abamectin some people call it Avid or

2462
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:10,379
whatever else and they would spray it

2463
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,539
once and they wouldn't see a two spot

2464
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:13,920
for a year

2465
01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:16,380
um and then people got to the point

2466
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,420
where they would spray they would dip

2467
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:20,219
their cuttings in it every run they

2468
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,719
would overuse it to a point where

2469
01:28:20,219 --> 01:28:24,960
there's a lot of mites in Northern

2470
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:27,840
California that are immune to quite a

2471
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,359
number of the harsher chemicals well I

2472
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:32,159
mean like like direwolf was saying I

2473
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:33,599
mean the main introduction is by

2474
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:34,559
bringing in new clones if they're only

2475
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,579
seeing it once a year it's probably

2476
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,960
because they're only bringing in new

2477
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:39,179
clones once a year to replace the Old

2478
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,980
Stock and bring it in the new spider

2479
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:44,000
mites with it

2480
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:44,000
I think foreign

2481
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,420
go ahead

2482
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,939
oh I was just gonna say four spider

2483
01:28:49,619 --> 01:28:52,500
mites and maybe maybe it's different

2484
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:55,079
because you're definitely in California

2485
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:57,420
is a very Agricultural and intense area

2486
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:58,979
so but where I where I live I live in an

2487
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:02,579
area that's basically the size of like

2488
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:04,379
Ukiah but it's uh it's about like 3 000

2489
01:29:02,579 --> 01:29:06,179
Acres of greenhouse so it's just like

2490
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,520
solid greenhouses

2491
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:11,039
um and lots of different people own them

2492
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:13,260
so there's it's I would argue at least

2493
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:15,019
as agriculturally intensive as Mendo is

2494
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:17,280
and everyone's spraying different stuff

2495
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:18,659
and what I've seen a bunch of times like

2496
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,359
I'll tell you A friend of mine owns a

2497
01:29:18,658 --> 01:29:23,759
big cucumber greenhouse and he had the

2498
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:26,219
same story that not so sang basically

2499
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,739
like when I first uh was going in there

2500
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:31,139
he was literally like tank mixing like

2501
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:33,238
you know six times the rate of avid with

2502
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:34,679
ten times three to fluoramite something

2503
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:36,899
literally I'm not even making those

2504
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:38,880
numbers up like it was yeah amounts of

2505
01:29:36,899 --> 01:29:40,738
stuff and uh and that would basically

2506
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,500
Buy in like five days like he was just

2507
01:29:40,738 --> 01:29:45,839
in a mad Panic spraying over and over

2508
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:49,198
and over again and

2509
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:52,980
so he switched to using bio control for

2510
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:54,539
that and within three months

2511
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:56,099
um you could and again I'll just

2512
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:57,479
elaborate on this a little bit but

2513
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,219
within three months you could go in

2514
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:01,439
there with a regular rate of fluoramite

2515
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:02,819
or a regular rate of avid and it looked

2516
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,559
like you dropped a nuclear bomb in there

2517
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:06,899
like you'd spray once it would just like

2518
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,340
wipe everything out and but so there's

2519
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:11,399
two things that can kind of go on with

2520
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:13,079
pest populations is the majority of what

2521
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:16,079
I've seen especially with spider mites

2522
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:17,698
is like it's a it's a short-term

2523
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:19,260
selection pressure so as soon as you

2524
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:21,658
take that selection pressure which may

2525
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:24,179
be a spring Avid all the time away for a

2526
01:30:21,658 --> 01:30:26,399
while there's nothing selecting for that

2527
01:30:24,179 --> 01:30:28,560
in the population so it just goes back

2528
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,299
to being susceptible you do get

2529
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,159
sometimes if you look at other pests

2530
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:36,480
like white flies a good example there's

2531
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:38,519
a type of uh White fly uh from down from

2532
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:40,439
Southwest it comes from Southwestern U.S

2533
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:42,480
and it comes from those really

2534
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:44,899
agricultural intense areas where they're

2535
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:47,579
getting sprayed a lot and in those cases

2536
01:30:44,899 --> 01:30:49,619
the there's a lot of resistance to

2537
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:50,939
insecticides it's actually become fixed

2538
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:52,738
in the population where it doesn't

2539
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:54,899
matter it's just like every single one

2540
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:55,799
just like if you're breeding autoflowers

2541
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:57,899
and you got to the point where

2542
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,360
everything is Autoflower well you can't

2543
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:02,460
blend that out but I haven't seen that a

2544
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:04,679
lot it's definitely possible with mites

2545
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:07,800
I have not seen it I've seen it with

2546
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:08,880
white fly and that's about it it

2547
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,279
definitely couldn't happen with other

2548
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,079
stuff but most of the resistance is

2549
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:15,359
generally local it's generally because

2550
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:18,738
the like the people on that farm have

2551
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:18,738
been overusing okay

2552
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:24,900
makes sense I I what I what I find in

2553
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:27,600
Mendo is when because spider mites breed

2554
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:30,059
more rapidly when the temperatures go up

2555
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,800
and the humidity goes down

2556
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,420
um people tend to like you know

2557
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,279
especially inside and stuff like that

2558
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:37,440
they really tend to get beat up in

2559
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:39,599
summertime and then they tend to get

2560
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,099
ahead in Winter and they lose again in

2561
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,320
summer

2562
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,579
um and you know and then there's a lot

2563
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:46,920
of things too where people used to

2564
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:49,679
overuse all those chemicals especially

2565
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:51,960
when in the 215 era the clubs only

2566
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:54,539
tested for parts per million

2567
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:56,340
uh people had it figured out like how

2568
01:31:54,539 --> 01:31:58,800
close you could use certain chemicals

2569
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,900
and still test clean when you took your

2570
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,699
product in and then they moved it to

2571
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:06,839
parts per billion

2572
01:32:02,698 --> 01:32:09,479
uh and that changed things a bunch

2573
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:11,219
um and you know and so now obviously all

2574
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:13,919
those things are banned

2575
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:16,079
and you can't use them at all

2576
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,239
um and so you know people have have gone

2577
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:20,100
to bio control or they've gone to pet

2578
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:24,919
they've gone to bugs they've gone to

2579
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:24,920
like simpler methods I think

2580
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:28,979
that's definitely what

2581
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:30,719
that's definitely what's happened in

2582
01:32:28,979 --> 01:32:32,759
Canada with the legal market right just

2583
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:33,960
generally everyone uses as much like

2584
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,579
there's definitely some people spraying

2585
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:37,560
some nasty stuff in the black market but

2586
01:32:35,579 --> 01:32:40,319
most of them are pretty

2587
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:43,380
um they use they they're pretty IBM like

2588
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,599
producing a lot of benefit uh bio

2589
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,739
control but the one that I just find

2590
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,120
there's just there's some things that

2591
01:32:46,738 --> 01:32:51,479
biocontrol just doesn't have a great

2592
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:52,920
answer to and cannabis aphid is one that

2593
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:54,539
is just it has great answers like

2594
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:57,239
there's tons of stuff

2595
01:32:54,539 --> 01:32:58,979
will control cannabis aphid really well

2596
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:00,718
they're they'll never get rid of them to

2597
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:01,919
understand and they're you know gets

2598
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,380
expensive

2599
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:07,500
um there's some that I'm just like I

2600
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:09,719
personally just can't Envision like long

2601
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:11,340
term not like there's just not going to

2602
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:12,239
be a bio control that's going to control

2603
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:16,199
them

2604
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:17,698
cost effectively and so I mean

2605
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:20,939
um there's a couple like that but most

2606
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:22,138
of them are pretty pretty uh controlled

2607
01:33:20,939 --> 01:33:24,119
I think probably what you've got going

2608
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:27,300
on in Mendo is a climate thing too where

2609
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:29,340
it's just really yeah 100 bad climate

2610
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:30,960
like where where it'd be hard to make

2611
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:33,840
bio controls work properly because you

2612
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,119
got really low humidity all the time

2613
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,159
um but sorry the other thing I was going

2614
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:39,719
to mention with the spider mites the one

2615
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:42,299
of the most common things that that I

2616
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:44,520
see is spider mites they go into a

2617
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:46,860
hibernation under short days so they go

2618
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:49,199
into what's called diapause and so

2619
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:51,059
basically what I see happen is really

2620
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:52,859
communist terminal get bad spider mites

2621
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:55,080
and then they think they got rid of them

2622
01:33:52,859 --> 01:33:56,880
but just you know a whole bunch of the

2623
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:58,859
population is just like hiding you know

2624
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,260
in their electrical outlets and you know

2625
01:33:58,859 --> 01:34:03,960
any little crevice in your room

2626
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:06,659
in diapause and they'll do that like

2627
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:08,819
kind of so basically they're going to go

2628
01:34:06,658 --> 01:34:10,379
cycle just in and out of diapers so they

2629
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:12,299
might disappear for like two months up

2630
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:14,100
into your room somewhere and then you

2631
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:15,179
think it's all clean and then you're

2632
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,400
like where did all these spider mites

2633
01:34:15,179 --> 01:34:19,859
come from and that's what it was doing

2634
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:24,479
diapers

2635
01:34:19,859 --> 01:34:26,639
cannabis aphids I can say for for Mendo

2636
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:27,779
um it's really the First new pest that

2637
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,779
I've seen

2638
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:32,759
in probably the last you know them and

2639
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:34,139
russet mites honestly are only of the

2640
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,119
two new things that have come along

2641
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:37,440
really within the last like five to

2642
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:40,979
seven years

2643
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:42,599
uh yeah for sure sure go ahead and you

2644
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:44,698
know and cannabis aphids I've had

2645
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:46,440
experience with lots of other types of

2646
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:48,359
aphids before

2647
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:51,299
um cannabis aphids just breed so

2648
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:53,639
unbelievably fast

2649
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:55,920
um and they're all female and they all

2650
01:34:53,639 --> 01:34:57,179
are pregnant and their and their embryos

2651
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,819
have embryos

2652
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:01,139
so they just replicated such a rate like

2653
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:02,579
you were saying there's lots of things

2654
01:35:01,139 --> 01:35:05,520
that kill them

2655
01:35:02,579 --> 01:35:07,380
but you miss a couple and give it a few

2656
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,820
weeks and they'll be back to Crazy

2657
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:11,340
levels again

2658
01:35:08,819 --> 01:35:14,519
yeah just to like it there I don't think

2659
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:16,980
most people just cry I can't tell people

2660
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,719
enough times like don't get them they're

2661
01:35:16,979 --> 01:35:20,218
literally the worst thing you could ever

2662
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:23,520
have like so I'll give you an example of

2663
01:35:20,219 --> 01:35:26,219
just how bad they are is I had just on a

2664
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,600
personal growth so I was doing some uh

2665
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:29,760
we were doing some trials somewhere for

2666
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,020
work for cannabis aphid and I must have

2667
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,239
had to come from here but I must have

2668
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:34,560
ended up with one on my clothes and

2669
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:36,238
couldn't have been more than one or two

2670
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,860
aphid because I don't even like I would

2671
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,678
never walk right from a place like that

2672
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:42,000
into my grow room so but somehow a

2673
01:35:40,679 --> 01:35:43,020
cannabis aphid can that was the only

2674
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,179
place it could have come from so

2675
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:46,800
cannabis if it can only go from cannabis

2676
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:48,719
plants right so if you're like whatever

2677
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,400
living it somewhere where there's no

2678
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,600
cannabis plants around you got cannabis

2679
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:53,698
anything like you brought them in on

2680
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,280
cuttings 100

2681
01:35:53,698 --> 01:35:57,658
um or or like someone dumb like me

2682
01:35:56,279 --> 01:36:01,319
brought them in on their clothes from a

2683
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:03,000
place that had cannabis aphid and at the

2684
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:04,679
time so I was just playing around with

2685
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,079
everything and you could control them to

2686
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:08,880
kind of like blow you could keep them at

2687
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:11,760
a dull Roar pretty

2688
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,319
easily with soaps or bio controls or

2689
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,699
like we're using lace Wing I did a bunch

2690
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:17,279
of different stuff it wasn't hard to

2691
01:36:14,698 --> 01:36:19,738
keep them fairly under control but to

2692
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:21,420
get rid of them was next to Impossible

2693
01:36:19,738 --> 01:36:24,539
because you literally have to get rid of

2694
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:27,480
every single one

2695
01:36:24,539 --> 01:36:30,719
um and I literally had to take my entire

2696
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:33,599
collection down to

2697
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:35,760
um like four little clones and spray

2698
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,560
them almost to death with silt to get

2699
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:39,420
rid of them until they were entirely

2700
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:41,159
clean like they're so on a commercial

2701
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:42,420
thing it's basically possible you could

2702
01:36:41,158 --> 01:36:43,559
never

2703
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,940
um I don't think it's possible to get

2704
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,679
rid of them the one thing I would say

2705
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:50,099
that I have seen and I don't know what

2706
01:36:46,679 --> 01:36:53,158
the exact answer to them is is uh heat

2707
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:54,719
treatments so with the crop in

2708
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:56,698
um I've seen it the only people I've

2709
01:36:54,719 --> 01:37:00,899
seen actually get rid of them completely

2710
01:36:56,698 --> 01:37:02,219
used it did uh via heat treatments but

2711
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:04,979
maybe if we can back up a little bit so

2712
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:06,179
why they're so bad compared to you know

2713
01:37:04,979 --> 01:37:08,459
a lot of people you'll get like an

2714
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:10,319
aphids on your cannabis crop and then

2715
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,359
they don't do do anything that's like

2716
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:15,479
pretty common so a lot of pests are

2717
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:17,339
they're adapted to the crop species so

2718
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:20,339
for instance on tomatoes don't get a

2719
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:22,319
whole lot of uh aphids and most most

2720
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,000
times on a tomato crop in a greenhouse

2721
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:25,559
you'll get

2722
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,760
um aphids that'll come in and they just

2723
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,020
don't they kind of get going a little

2724
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,159
bit and they need to Disappear by

2725
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:31,440
themselves it's because they don't like

2726
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:33,299
the host plant and every once in a while

2727
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:34,678
you'll get one that's adopted and then

2728
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:36,480
it's like look out it's basically the

2729
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:38,579
same as cannabis aphid and it was

2730
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:39,839
Cannabis if it is just highly adapted to

2731
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:41,819
that

2732
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,360
um that crop so as soon as they get

2733
01:37:41,819 --> 01:37:47,340
going they're they'll go like

2734
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,420
they'll go like crazy but yeah if you go

2735
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:50,159
back to the heat stream and that's one

2736
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:52,139
of the things that actually came from

2737
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:53,879
the black market where I don't know but

2738
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:56,219
in general but I was who's kind of

2739
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,960
spread that around in Canada

2740
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:59,639
um and I got it from the black market I

2741
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:01,319
knew some black market people that were

2742
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:03,900
getting you can get these heaters that

2743
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:06,059
they use in hotel rooms uh to kill bed

2744
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:09,719
bugs so basically if you heat up a room

2745
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:10,860
to like you know about 45 or 50 Celsius

2746
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:12,359
um

2747
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:14,099
for about five hours it'll kill

2748
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:16,799
everything that's in there

2749
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:20,039
um and some guys were in the black

2750
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:22,020
market were playing around for that for

2751
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:24,000
broad might

2752
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,100
um and it doesn't work by the way

2753
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,698
um but we also put ended up playing

2754
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:31,860
around with it for cannabis aphid and it

2755
01:38:29,698 --> 01:38:33,960
does work pretty well so they and I the

2756
01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:36,539
thing is like you can really fast or

2757
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,279
crop cranking those temperatures and the

2758
01:38:36,539 --> 01:38:39,840
guys that I know that have figured it

2759
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:41,158
out obviously they won't tell anyone

2760
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,960
they did but it's something to do with

2761
01:38:41,158 --> 01:38:44,339
heat treatments and it's something with

2762
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,198
playing around with like those high

2763
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:49,619
temperatures like 45 Celsius or

2764
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:51,960
something for a few hours enough to

2765
01:38:49,619 --> 01:38:53,340
um make them all dehydrated so there's

2766
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,600
definitely answers that I think will get

2767
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:57,900
figured out because I've definitely seen

2768
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,179
a few people do that have done it but uh

2769
01:38:57,899 --> 01:39:01,619
yeah for most people I'm like just take

2770
01:39:00,179 --> 01:39:03,539
a good look at your cutting before you

2771
01:39:01,619 --> 01:39:06,238
bring that in so your your place because

2772
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:08,880
they spread so quick you know they they

2773
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,678
can actually in California they transfer

2774
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,480
by air

2775
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,119
um you know from just different because

2776
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:17,519
there's so many outdoor Gardens and

2777
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:19,079
really what happened to us is it was

2778
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,719
Oregon's fault

2779
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:24,119
is Oregon had hundreds and hundreds of

2780
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:27,239
acres of hemp once we made hemp legal

2781
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:29,158
through the farm bill uh federally and

2782
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:31,859
then the hemp Market the CBD Market

2783
01:39:29,158 --> 01:39:34,138
collapsed and people had literally

2784
01:39:31,859 --> 01:39:36,059
thousands of acres of hemp uh that was

2785
01:39:34,139 --> 01:39:39,179
going to be worthless and so they didn't

2786
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:41,100
Implement any IPM and some of these

2787
01:39:39,179 --> 01:39:42,719
cannabis aphids took over and just

2788
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,219
replicated at a rate that was never

2789
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,779
before seen

2790
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:48,539
and then they just started spreading

2791
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:49,679
like wildfire from there oh yeah so

2792
01:39:48,539 --> 01:39:51,539
basically that's exactly what's happened

2793
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:53,940
so cannabis safe and needs to go from a

2794
01:39:51,539 --> 01:39:55,439
cannabis plant to a cannabis plant and

2795
01:39:53,939 --> 01:39:57,479
generally it's I've seen most of the

2796
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:58,738
time it's from cut it's from imported

2797
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:00,178
cuttings but you can definitely get that

2798
01:39:58,738 --> 01:40:02,158
so basically when they they don't

2799
01:40:00,179 --> 01:40:03,539
usually have wings but when they run out

2800
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:05,819
of food

2801
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:07,679
um a food source or that gets too many

2802
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:08,759
they'll develop wings and fly somewhere

2803
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:11,279
else so yeah if you've got a lot of

2804
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:14,340
growers near you or hemp fields and

2805
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:15,779
stuff you'll get Flyers root aphids

2806
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:17,219
actually worse so at least with those

2807
01:40:15,779 --> 01:40:19,139
ones like with cannabis safe and you're

2808
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:21,000
like okay well at least if you know if

2809
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:22,500
you're away from everybody else or if

2810
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,300
you screen your Greenhouse or screen

2811
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,619
your grow room like do a good job in

2812
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:27,060
your garden you're probably not going to

2813
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:28,500
get them even if you didn't screen them

2814
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:30,960
you're probably not getting them in your

2815
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:33,060
grow room from like a hemp field unless

2816
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,619
you're like intaking directly out of the

2817
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:37,139
outside

2818
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:38,880
but uh rude aphids the problem is

2819
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:41,340
they're actually worse because they're

2820
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,380
an actual quite a widespread pest that

2821
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:45,779
lives on a lot of different plants so

2822
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:47,219
you can uh get root aphids from I don't

2823
01:40:45,779 --> 01:40:48,658
know all the host pieces so you can just

2824
01:40:47,219 --> 01:40:51,300
get them from like weeds inside your

2825
01:40:48,658 --> 01:40:52,799
place so that's but it's interesting

2826
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,480
because I'm the same thing as like when

2827
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,000
I grew up most of the time it was just

2828
01:40:54,479 --> 01:41:00,359
like it was you know thrips and spider

2829
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,859
mites up until p.m the whole PM outbreak

2830
01:41:00,359 --> 01:41:04,019
kind of blew up I'm guessing probably on

2831
01:41:01,859 --> 01:41:04,738
2000s or something

2832
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:07,739
um

2833
01:41:04,738 --> 01:41:10,319
and then all these new ones the you know

2834
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:12,718
have Russ at my uh

2835
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:14,759
cannabis aphid root aphid and then

2836
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,679
Obsolete and viroid they're all like

2837
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,300
came out of a legal thing it was just

2838
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:19,980
from increased sharing of genetics

2839
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:23,340
material for sure

2840
01:41:19,979 --> 01:41:25,319
it was very poor practices and it was

2841
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:27,960
people stopping maintaining their own

2842
01:41:25,319 --> 01:41:29,639
mothers and then and then buying and

2843
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:32,460
trading amongst their small group of

2844
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:34,920
friends and going to centralized

2845
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:38,340
locations like dispensaries or stores or

2846
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:42,139
nurseries and just for the ease of

2847
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:42,139
getting their plant stock somewhere

2848
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:47,639
no good

2849
01:41:45,779 --> 01:41:49,800
always listen to originally what we saw

2850
01:41:47,639 --> 01:41:51,539
was just from people it was just from

2851
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,279
you know Black Market channels opened up

2852
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:55,079
more and people were sharing clones a

2853
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:57,420
lot more than they used to because like

2854
01:41:55,079 --> 01:42:00,899
for instance in that uh

2855
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:03,060
uh that Nelson BC area that was where

2856
01:42:00,899 --> 01:42:04,679
have breasted might first showed up in

2857
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:07,260
Canada that I saw and that was from

2858
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:09,719
clones that came out of Colorado

2859
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:11,039
um that got brought up

2860
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:13,319
um

2861
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:16,019
but I'd say in Canada where the bigger

2862
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:17,819
problem has been it's it's the nursery

2863
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:20,940
thing was kind of stage two of that

2864
01:42:17,819 --> 01:42:23,579
where now because it's still legal most

2865
01:42:20,939 --> 01:42:25,198
people are buying from nurseries and

2866
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:26,399
it's like whatever they do hype clone is

2867
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:29,279
you got to get it from this one nursery

2868
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:30,960
and then like people are buying it I'm

2869
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:33,059
like dude don't buy it from that place

2870
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:35,219
like you're gonna get all kinds

2871
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:36,480
stuff and they buy it anyways and all of

2872
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:38,279
a sudden they've got you know cannabis

2873
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:39,599
aphid pops late and then everything else

2874
01:42:38,279 --> 01:42:41,340
coming from it so that's definitely been

2875
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,960
the second wave is those those legal

2876
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:45,420
nurseries which is I think what you guys

2877
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,920
are seeing in California a lot too that

2878
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:49,319
was what I was going to comment on was

2879
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,760
the the legal Nursery aspect

2880
01:42:49,319 --> 01:42:52,079
um like you know different different

2881
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:54,060
nurseries specifically in California

2882
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:56,158
when a hype strain would go off there

2883
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:58,619
would be one major clone Nursery

2884
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:00,479
supplying millions of those clones to

2885
01:42:58,618 --> 01:43:04,799
all the different dispensaries out there

2886
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:06,738
and if hlv was just in one it takes no

2887
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:09,779
effort at all to just

2888
01:43:06,738 --> 01:43:11,759
ruin every room that it touches so yeah

2889
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:13,618
that's been a massive explosion the the

2890
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:17,699
secondary nurseries the legal nurseries

2891
01:43:13,618 --> 01:43:19,738
all that major pathogen vector

2892
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:21,599
the thing with with tops late is it's

2893
01:43:19,738 --> 01:43:22,919
again I've never dealt I've seen it I've

2894
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,780
had a bunch of buddies that have had it

2895
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,579
pretty well and I kind of know I've

2896
01:43:24,779 --> 01:43:28,738
dealt with other like

2897
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:30,238
uh you know vegetable crop viruses and

2898
01:43:28,738 --> 01:43:32,638
star viroids that are similar to that

2899
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,959
and thyroids are usually really easy to

2900
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:36,060
control because the nice thing about

2901
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:37,739
them is like they can't persist outside

2902
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:39,900
of like plant saps so they're not going

2903
01:43:37,738 --> 01:43:41,579
to just sit on your like you know floor

2904
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:43,698
for a long period of time and then

2905
01:43:41,579 --> 01:43:46,019
reinfect like a lot of us

2906
01:43:43,698 --> 01:43:49,019
so when you see those people it's just

2907
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:51,060
like everything they're shipping

2908
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:52,980
got hops Leighton fire like they're

2909
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:56,300
doing something seriously wrong like

2910
01:43:52,979 --> 01:43:56,299
it's just really bad

2911
01:43:56,579 --> 01:44:04,559
what I think happened is uh people you

2912
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:07,319
know uh people would use similar

2913
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:10,139
scissors or similar razors

2914
01:44:07,319 --> 01:44:11,939
um or you know uh with cloning would

2915
01:44:10,139 --> 01:44:13,859
spread it really badly I think in a lot

2916
01:44:11,939 --> 01:44:15,839
of those nurseries and it would go from

2917
01:44:13,859 --> 01:44:17,939
being on just a few plants to being on

2918
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,319
hundreds yeah almost all the obsolete

2919
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:20,759
enviroid in my opinion there's

2920
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:22,979
definitely some that's been spread from

2921
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:25,139
seed but I think the vast majority has

2922
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:26,579
just been spread from you know some dude

2923
01:44:25,139 --> 01:44:28,380
using the same cutting knife on

2924
01:44:26,579 --> 01:44:30,600
everything

2925
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:34,260
yeah it seems to be how it's it's

2926
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:36,239
rapidly spread and the water uh liquid

2927
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:39,360
contact between root systems it sounds

2928
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:40,919
like that's another vector

2929
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:42,839
that that was a new one that I heard

2930
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:44,460
when on your guys when when you had that

2931
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,380
lady on it was interesting to me because

2932
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:48,239
I'm like man that makes it but I don't

2933
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:50,279
doubt it either but I'm like man I've

2934
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:52,500
watched a lot worse I've watched it

2935
01:44:50,279 --> 01:44:54,658
happen in action it's it's pretty crazy

2936
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,219
yeah and then she you know one of the

2937
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:59,099
interesting things she brought up was

2938
01:44:56,219 --> 01:45:01,618
just how like Leaf tissue it could be

2939
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:05,039
hit or miss whether or not it showed up

2940
01:45:01,618 --> 01:45:06,599
on testing but root tissue it was like a

2941
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,880
hundred percent

2942
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:10,800
if if you had it it was going to show up

2943
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,840
on if you ripped off some roots and

2944
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,400
tested those

2945
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,319
um and how it moved through the plant

2946
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:18,539
you know so and we've definitely had

2947
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:20,279
buddies we called it dudding back then I

2948
01:45:18,539 --> 01:45:22,439
don't know if it was hop Layton but we

2949
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:23,779
definitely have had buddies that like it

2950
01:45:22,439 --> 01:45:27,419
ripped through their whole scene

2951
01:45:23,779 --> 01:45:29,158
basically through runoff

2952
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:31,260
that was what that was that was how it

2953
01:45:29,158 --> 01:45:32,579
got that one's new to me I I that was a

2954
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:33,840
really good episode that you guys like

2955
01:45:32,579 --> 01:45:36,238
that interview she had some really

2956
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:38,760
interesting information that I hadn't uh

2957
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:40,738
uh heard before it totally makes sense

2958
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,239
but that's uh it's it's kind of a

2959
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:43,678
different

2960
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:45,299
um thing because most it's not something

2961
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:47,940
you see in a lot of other cases because

2962
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:49,739
for instance like in you know Greenhouse

2963
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:52,019
vegetables everything's getting run

2964
01:45:49,738 --> 01:45:53,819
through like all the run like they do

2965
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:55,500
research but I mean everything's getting

2966
01:45:53,819 --> 01:45:56,579
it's there's not a lot the way they're

2967
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,899
set up

2968
01:45:56,579 --> 01:45:59,279
everything just goes right you know

2969
01:45:57,899 --> 01:46:00,839
they're all in Rockwell slabs and it

2970
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:04,019
just basically goes directly out of that

2971
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:06,360
one slab into the you know the runoff

2972
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:07,860
cat Gutter and then it gets run through

2973
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:09,839
like ozone treatment and everything so

2974
01:46:07,859 --> 01:46:12,000
you're not getting viruses recirculating

2975
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,679
like that I think it's kind of like a

2976
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,658
it's partly to do with how a lot of

2977
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:17,760
people are set up definitely take the

2978
01:46:15,658 --> 01:46:19,259
window to like no-till dudes when you're

2979
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,300
when you're like well crap you get

2980
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:22,980
Obsolete and viroid in there once and

2981
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:25,619
you're basically stuck with it

2982
01:46:22,979 --> 01:46:28,198
dude there was a um there was a thing

2983
01:46:25,618 --> 01:46:30,658
you know the DNA was part of it

2984
01:46:28,198 --> 01:46:32,158
um uh and they had they were one of the

2985
01:46:30,658 --> 01:46:34,138
first people that had like huge

2986
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:36,738
Greenhouse scenes in Salinas California

2987
01:46:34,139 --> 01:46:39,539
when legal first happened

2988
01:46:36,738 --> 01:46:42,419
and they did all these like two foot

2989
01:46:39,539 --> 01:46:44,340
deep five foot wide 100 foot long beds

2990
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:47,100
everywhere and all these Greenies

2991
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:49,260
and they brought in rude aphids on their

2992
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:51,659
plants very first run

2993
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:55,199
and they basically infected these living

2994
01:46:51,658 --> 01:46:56,879
soil beds with root aphids

2995
01:46:55,198 --> 01:46:58,198
and then they struggled for a couple of

2996
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,560
years and then they went to one gallon

2997
01:46:58,198 --> 01:47:00,559
pots

2998
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,600
yeah they couldn't get rid of them

2999
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:07,980
I have I I personally wouldn't do it I

3000
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,199
have one of my good friends who's a big

3001
01:47:07,979 --> 01:47:12,599
living soil guy and I've actually seen

3002
01:47:10,198 --> 01:47:15,299
him for sure I've seen rude aphids in

3003
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:16,920
his place and they've never got going

3004
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,119
like I don't think he ever gets rid of

3005
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:20,520
them but they don't actually cause him

3006
01:47:18,118 --> 01:47:22,198
any problem and and I think it is

3007
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:23,940
because the living soil kind of keeps

3008
01:47:22,198 --> 01:47:27,539
them in check

3009
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:28,919
um but yeah I don't I don't know 100 on

3010
01:47:27,539 --> 01:47:30,658
that the one thing I would say on hops

3011
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:33,239
late and viral those like one of my

3012
01:47:30,658 --> 01:47:35,039
friends he runs a legal place that was

3013
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,779
the first one in Canada that I saw that

3014
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:38,819
got it really bad like they had to like

3015
01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:41,340
shut down the whole they had like a new

3016
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:43,079
startup got it all rolling they did like

3017
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,159
one crop and we're like what the heck is

3018
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:45,840
going on here and they couldn't figure

3019
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:47,158
it out and they finally they were there

3020
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,219
was before anyone really knew what

3021
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:52,439
Obsolete and viroid is and he's like

3022
01:47:50,219 --> 01:47:54,779
dude it was a disaster for them like but

3023
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:56,158
he's like it was actually super easy to

3024
01:47:54,779 --> 01:47:57,658
control he's like literally as soon as

3025
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:59,279
you got rid of it they literally just

3026
01:47:57,658 --> 01:48:01,799
got rid of all the plants they didn't

3027
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:04,380
even sanitize they literally threw all

3028
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:05,940
the plants out waited a week put fresh

3029
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:08,340
plants from a tissue culture and they've

3030
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:10,219
never had them again and he's like you

3031
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:13,079
could easily

3032
01:48:10,219 --> 01:48:14,639
pardon me Matt that sometimes that's it

3033
01:48:13,079 --> 01:48:16,500
you know some of our friends just said

3034
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:18,539
throw it out start over

3035
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,158
the quickest way through it

3036
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:21,719
well it depends on your setup probably

3037
01:48:20,158 --> 01:48:24,539
now that you've got that whole runoff

3038
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:26,698
thing uh yeah set up on Rockwell cubes

3039
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:28,260
and they probably had like a research

3040
01:48:26,698 --> 01:48:30,479
like I said it's pretty standard in a

3041
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:32,460
lot of those sit-ups to have ozone in

3042
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:33,718
line that kills anything like that so

3043
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,819
it's going to limit how much it's going

3044
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:37,020
to spread but he said he could easily

3045
01:48:35,819 --> 01:48:38,279
he's like if I had to do it again I

3046
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,320
wouldn't even have pulled the crop he's

3047
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:42,300
like I just would have like watched you

3048
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:44,158
know maybe did a good job testing his

3049
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:46,020
mother's and then just going oh that

3050
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:47,879
one's got it and he's just he's just

3051
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:50,159
like just from sanitation like don't use

3052
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:52,440
the same knife from plant to plant and

3053
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:54,420
he's like I'm totally confident that I

3054
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:55,439
could uh have done it but he's the one

3055
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,940
of the guys I know you were talking

3056
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:59,879
about whether it could come from seed or

3057
01:48:56,939 --> 01:49:01,979
not I've seen firsthand lab tests that

3058
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:04,260
he got so that was what was kind of sad

3059
01:49:01,979 --> 01:49:05,819
about that whole thing is that dude just

3060
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:07,980
threw out his whole clone collection

3061
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:10,319
when he started that license place

3062
01:49:07,979 --> 01:49:13,319
because he was worried about bringing in

3063
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:16,139
some weird Pastor virus but in all fresh

3064
01:49:13,319 --> 01:49:18,179
Cali seed I started that whole legal

3065
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:20,460
place from there and that's where his

3066
01:49:18,179 --> 01:49:23,279
top late and viroid came from for sure

3067
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:24,899
and he showed me test packs of like

3068
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:27,179
tests from some of the packs that he got

3069
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:29,238
they tested positive first so there's no

3070
01:49:27,179 --> 01:49:31,920
doubt some of them are getting brutal

3071
01:49:29,238 --> 01:49:33,419
brutal bro you know she also mentioned

3072
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,880
or I think someone in the chat at the

3073
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:37,380
time mentioned pollen and it traveling

3074
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:39,000
on pollen and I didn't I'd never even

3075
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:41,819
taken that into consideration like a

3076
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,039
dotted nail pollen transfer I don't know

3077
01:49:41,819 --> 01:49:48,899
if it's possible but I probably would

3078
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:52,439
for for somebody like me who keeps a lot

3079
01:49:48,899 --> 01:49:55,859
of uh a lot of old a lot of old clones

3080
01:49:52,439 --> 01:49:57,599
that are not currently popular

3081
01:49:55,859 --> 01:49:59,519
um and it's hard to get people to back

3082
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:01,079
them up for you and help because if

3083
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,060
there's not a financial incentive

3084
01:50:01,079 --> 01:50:05,819
they're not particularly interested

3085
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:07,440
uh it's really scary

3086
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:09,539
um because there's there's some things

3087
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:11,460
that are really nice that aren't very

3088
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:13,260
well spread out

3089
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:15,118
um and can get ruined and I mean we have

3090
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:17,940
good friends of ours that lost some

3091
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:20,099
pretty old and some pretty rare things

3092
01:50:17,939 --> 01:50:22,138
um before the Hop Layton thing was even

3093
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:23,820
known we just called it dudding

3094
01:50:22,139 --> 01:50:26,579
and people didn't know what precautions

3095
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:29,519
to take uh and so I'm pretty worried

3096
01:50:26,579 --> 01:50:33,658
about the combination of root aphids and

3097
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:36,119
russets and hop latents and and even

3098
01:50:33,658 --> 01:50:38,460
stuff like you know the the rude aphids

3099
01:50:36,118 --> 01:50:40,079
can spread hop latent

3100
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,520
yeah I don't know that that's I think

3101
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,500
they probably can I don't know that

3102
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,940
that's actually been proven 100 have you

3103
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,560
seen I don't think so either but I

3104
01:50:44,939 --> 01:50:48,539
wouldn't like them

3105
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,580
it's pretty likely so there's a lot of

3106
01:50:48,539 --> 01:50:52,738
kind of myth about that what I my

3107
01:50:50,579 --> 01:50:54,779
understanding is something like thrips

3108
01:50:52,738 --> 01:50:59,039
or spider mites is really they're not

3109
01:50:54,779 --> 01:51:01,920
thrips are virus carriers but from my

3110
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:04,560
understanding from this actually came

3111
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:07,440
from one of the someone that's like PhD

3112
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:09,780
guys in in virology like you know way

3113
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:12,000
more than me I do they told me that

3114
01:51:09,779 --> 01:51:13,979
there's the chance of thrips carrying

3115
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,179
hops latent Viro is almost next to

3116
01:51:13,979 --> 01:51:16,339
nothing

3117
01:51:15,179 --> 01:51:19,260
um I think

3118
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:20,940
aphids is definitely quite likely and

3119
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:23,219
even if it's like to me everyone's right

3120
01:51:20,939 --> 01:51:24,658
now so caught up in hops late in viral

3121
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:26,340
they forget there's a million other

3122
01:51:24,658 --> 01:51:28,979
viruses out there that are just as bad

3123
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:30,719
that for sure aphids carry and thrips

3124
01:51:28,979 --> 01:51:32,939
carry some of them too

3125
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:36,359
um but aphids are probably the number

3126
01:51:32,939 --> 01:51:37,678
one like virus Vector in agricultural oh

3127
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:39,539
we've been getting there's this stuff

3128
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:42,300
that's been spreading around beet curly

3129
01:51:39,539 --> 01:51:45,679
top virus yep and it gets spread by it

3130
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:45,679
gets spread by Leaf hoppers

3131
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:50,698
um so there's and that's one of actually

3132
01:51:47,819 --> 01:51:53,639
one of one thing I'll mention because I

3133
01:51:50,698 --> 01:51:56,039
think it matters is you know in the in

3134
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:59,279
the old days when everybody was hiding

3135
01:51:56,039 --> 01:52:01,260
in in small and medium-sized indoors and

3136
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:02,639
everybody was up in the hills and tucked

3137
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:04,380
away

3138
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:06,719
um a lot of this stuff didn't spread so

3139
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:08,159
much and now that we've gone legal and

3140
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:11,340
people are going into all these

3141
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:13,979
traditional AG areas to grow cannabis

3142
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:16,139
all those traditional AG areas are ripe

3143
01:52:13,979 --> 01:52:18,658
with things that cannabis hasn't really

3144
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:20,219
grown next to yet

3145
01:52:18,658 --> 01:52:21,839
yeah and that's one of the things I

3146
01:52:20,219 --> 01:52:24,719
don't think people like I said I I live

3147
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:26,940
in a really agricultural intense area so

3148
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:28,920
basically it's all just greenhouses and

3149
01:52:26,939 --> 01:52:32,279
corn fields and like it's we've got I

3150
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:34,679
think it's 97 clear-cut for agriculture

3151
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:36,118
where I live so what's interesting is

3152
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:37,679
I've seen it play out a bunch of times

3153
01:52:36,118 --> 01:52:39,420
like for instance like on tomatoes

3154
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,920
Tomatoes never used to get thrips so

3155
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:43,739
green has Tomatoes they didn't get

3156
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:45,779
thrips and then all of a sudden one year

3157
01:52:43,738 --> 01:52:47,519
thrips were like this massive issue on

3158
01:52:45,779 --> 01:52:49,380
tomatoes and they never went away it

3159
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,960
just kept kind of continued and if you

3160
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:54,118
traced back what it was it was they'd

3161
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:55,800
started growing wheat and so in the

3162
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:57,238
fields around the greenhouses they were

3163
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:59,520
growing wheat and wheat's got lots of

3164
01:52:57,238 --> 01:53:01,379
pollen and thrips love it so because

3165
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,239
there's like a food source and so you

3166
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:05,279
get these giant levels of thrips right

3167
01:53:03,238 --> 01:53:07,319
beside your greenhouse and when you get

3168
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:09,840
a situation like that and I've seen this

3169
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:12,899
with a bunch of different past most 99

3170
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:14,460
of the thrips don't like tomatoes but

3171
01:53:12,899 --> 01:53:16,979
sooner or later you get one that does

3172
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:18,600
and then or two that does and then they

3173
01:53:16,979 --> 01:53:22,678
breed and all of a sudden you've got

3174
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:25,020
thrips adapted to tomatoes and that's a

3175
01:53:22,679 --> 01:53:27,600
whole different story and that's anytime

3176
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:29,760
you get agricultural intense areas

3177
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:31,619
that's what you get is these jumps of a

3178
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:35,100
pest that doesn't necessarily normally

3179
01:53:31,618 --> 01:53:37,079
like cannabis or whatever that when you

3180
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:39,659
you know when you grow you know 10

3181
01:53:37,079 --> 01:53:41,519
kazillion white fly right beside a

3182
01:53:39,658 --> 01:53:43,738
cannabis crop sooner or later you know a

3183
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,840
couple like cannabis and they have

3184
01:53:43,738 --> 01:53:48,479
babies and then bang you got a whole new

3185
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:50,520
pest complex to deal with

3186
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:52,618
it just sounds like a never-ending cycle

3187
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,820
of pests pest pests and probably more

3188
01:53:52,618 --> 01:53:55,920
are going to be entering into our

3189
01:53:53,819 --> 01:53:58,559
cannabis sphere as it gets bigger more

3190
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,779
corporate oh certainly widespread

3191
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,280
and goes into all those areas that have

3192
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:03,300
all those different pests and then life

3193
01:54:02,279 --> 01:54:05,639
adapts

3194
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:07,619
you know well the one interesting thing

3195
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:09,480
like a year long time ago I used to be a

3196
01:54:07,618 --> 01:54:11,939
flower grower so I used to work at a

3197
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:13,439
really like a pretty big uh ornamental

3198
01:54:11,939 --> 01:54:15,359
greenhouse and we grew like a lot of

3199
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:17,579
different types of flowers like

3200
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:19,920
different species and one of the more

3201
01:54:17,579 --> 01:54:22,319
interesting things that I saw there is

3202
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,840
we always had like you know this type of

3203
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:26,399
this variety that always it just was

3204
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,360
never happy right and you're growing so

3205
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:30,118
many different things you could never

3206
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:32,279
bait nothing was ever perfect right and

3207
01:54:30,118 --> 01:54:35,698
one year we were just like we just took

3208
01:54:32,279 --> 01:54:39,000
all the we just did a broad sample for

3209
01:54:35,698 --> 01:54:40,799
virus for this specific virus uh which

3210
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,399
is pretty I would lay back this as a

3211
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:44,960
canvas one as well it was called uh

3212
01:54:43,399 --> 01:54:47,698
uh

3213
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:49,859
insv and patient necrotic spot virus and

3214
01:54:47,698 --> 01:54:51,539
there's a thrift spread virus and what

3215
01:54:49,859 --> 01:54:54,658
was interesting is when we did a broad

3216
01:54:51,539 --> 01:54:56,639
analysis of like all of our plants all

3217
01:54:54,658 --> 01:54:57,960
the plants pretty much all the plants

3218
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:59,940
that we were like always having problems

3219
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:01,560
with like I can't figure out why this

3220
01:54:59,939 --> 01:55:03,779
one won't grow this one's always got pH

3221
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:06,360
problems it looks like or this they all

3222
01:55:03,779 --> 01:55:09,719
had insv so it was all this like

3223
01:55:06,359 --> 01:55:11,460
basically like 90 of all of our what we

3224
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,739
thought was plant cultural problems was

3225
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:15,779
actually that it had a virus and doesn't

3226
01:55:13,738 --> 01:55:17,579
necessarily show the same all the time I

3227
01:55:15,779 --> 01:55:20,099
would lay that so that's probably

3228
01:55:17,579 --> 01:55:22,079
goes on in cannabis a lot

3229
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:23,520
that could be a lot that could be a lot

3230
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:26,399
of what people call when people think

3231
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:28,560
about like genetic drift or clones get

3232
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:30,000
old and tired and they don't want to

3233
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,739
root well anymore and they don't want to

3234
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,539
grow well anymore they could have just

3235
01:55:31,738 --> 01:55:35,339
picked up some kind of pathogen that

3236
01:55:33,539 --> 01:55:37,380
they don't have a way to detect

3237
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:38,639
well I want to keep everything going and

3238
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:40,199
I think we're gonna have to do a whole

3239
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,900
nother part two of this because it's

3240
01:55:40,198 --> 01:55:45,299
going to cut us off right at two hours

3241
01:55:41,899 --> 01:55:48,920
and yeah I mean I think we could do a

3242
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:48,920
whole nother show out of all this so

3243
