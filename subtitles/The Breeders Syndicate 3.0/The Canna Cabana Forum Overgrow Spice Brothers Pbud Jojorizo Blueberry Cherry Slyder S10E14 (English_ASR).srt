little Icebreaker we do a round table

42

each one of you tell us uh how did you

43
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,879
get into forums uh into the forums to

44
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,599
begin with uh as part of you growing or

45
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,798
you know Journey um maybe we can start

46
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,679
with D

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,479
Man sure uh I'm Dean I think everybody

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,799
knows

49
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,718
me uh knows the

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,240
forums uh I think I hit the forums you

51
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:58,759
know like

52
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:01,239
1997 when uh overgrow was still I think

53
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:05,239
it was called the Edge back then or

54
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,839
something like that and uh what a wild

55
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,959
ride that was when you first get on the

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,479
internet and uh it was the coolest place

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,439
ever dude like all these other people

58
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,119
grow that's when I just really started

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,840
getting growing weed indoors at that

60
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,360
time 97 98 and finding that dude people

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,759
were sharing genetics all over the place

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,680
so it's like wow this is cool so that's

63
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,199
where I kind of got started hanging out

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,239
there and pretty Rowdy place at the time

65
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:38,399
but it was definitely cool uh other

66
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,319
like-minded people around and uh didn't

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
know that existed you know especially on

68
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,439
the internet you know which was all

69
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,280
really new that at least to me I knew

70
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:50,400
I'd been around for a

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,959
while same here for sure um why I didn't

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,760
mean to interupt go ahead Darren please

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,080
no no I'm done dude I discovered it

74
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,679
basically

75
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,680
after I guess my dad gave me a

76
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,680
uh hand me-- down computer around

77
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:12,639
1990 4 or

78
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:15,839
so and didn't really discover the online

79
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,479
cannabis Community till closer

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,239
to uh

81
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,479
19 oh help me out here Darren when did

82
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,799
we when were we and and how late late

83
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:31,919
90s dude it was it it was late 90s yeah

84
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,599
yeah really pre 911 for sure like few

85
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,759
years before 911 okay so I I taught

86
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,079
myself to grow all the before that

87
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:43,399
without the internet I had to go Source

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,439
uh little underground books from Shady

89
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,360
little

90
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:50,519
bookstores uh here and there and finally

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,920
piece together how Hydroponics might

92
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,560
actually work of course I didn't have

93
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,958
enough sense to go to the library I

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,239
guess but um and then discovering the

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,598
forums

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,079
that was like oh this was everything I

97
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:08,158
needed I just I can't believe I didn't

98
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,640
have this trellis netting on my plants

99
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:14,399
to hold them up and here's a picture of

100
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:17,079
what I need to do and it's like oh boy

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,959
you know these forums are going to be

102
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,879
fun and they

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,478
were still are but they were right how

104
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:30,560
sir what do you got well uh late 80s I

105
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:35,439
uh moved to Colorado and uh could not

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,000
find good pot here on my own so thanks

107
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,319
to my great wife I was able to start

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,519
growing on my

109
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:50,879
own uh found the Internet by looking for

110
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:55,359
seeds um yes wasn't uh too long you know

111
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:59,560
after the late 990s I started really

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,879
looking for seeds I came across uh overg

113
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:07,680
grow in cannabis world and uh and

114
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:10,639
actually came across demman then and uh

115
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,639
became like his primary beta

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,038
tester um and at the same time I was

117
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,960
beta testing for Mota

118
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:25,000
Rebel uh had a great time because the

119
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:29,038
genetics were coming to me from them and

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,680
a few other folks up in Canada on the

121
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,839
west side

122
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,840
from uh where dman is we're sending me

123
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:41,959
genetics as well so um I kind of became

124
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:45,038
a weirdly I'm a very small scale grower

125
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,318
as most people who get to know me know

126
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:51,159
um but I ended up at one point holding

127
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,680
genetics and supplying clones to God I

128
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,880
don't know how many people Steve right

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,800
between you and me we sell stuff

130
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,199
everywhere everywhere everywhere

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,840
everywhere the world

132
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,439
possible we tried to get stuff there

133
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,159
yeah once we learn and we had the

134
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,800
hardest trouble I think with Darren

135
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,000
through the well Darren's a troublemaker

136
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,439
it it comes

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,959
naturally I mean packages made it to

138
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:24,319
Hungry with clones no problem but

139
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:26,918
couldn't get them past Canada security C

140
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,199
is Hardcore still still it's hard to get

141
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,439
CL over that border dude I don't know

142
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
how but cushy man that guy can get

143
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,800
clones over the Border I don't know how

144
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,758
he does it he's got a [ __ ] secret but

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,960
he does it but I'll tell you just just

146
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,759
to jump in here of all the elite clones

147
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,239
that you guys have heard about in the US

148
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,280
they they went through these two guys

149
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,240
hands before they went to anybody that's

150
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:54,198
amazing uh yeah Steve and and and how he

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,280
dude everything went through them

152
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,319
everything uh and that's that's kind of

153
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,038
weird

154
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,000
because you know we're older than

155
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,519
everybody else it's well we had to start

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,680
out with seed because we definitely

157
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,758
didn't have clone connections and then

158
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,079
when we finally discovered the online

159
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,360
community it just opened up everything

160
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,240
and then you're just the kid in the

161
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,160
candy store right

162
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,199
um I think I bought my first seeds for

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,879
Mark Emory way back in the day wow

164
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:31,199
and and he sent me strains I didn't

165
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:34,439
order but that's

166
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,439
story go

dense and the buds the buds on the

199
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,200
modified grapes are very reminiscent of

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,120
the ice cream cake yeah um they look a

201
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,320
lot like the ice cream cake but when you

202
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,759
smell them you can tell they definitely

203
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,200
two different different beasts it's just

204
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:22,799

skiddy feno um prettyy sure mine was a

345
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:30,198
bit more distributed yeah that than the

346
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,399
knucklehead

347

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,319
strains

354
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:54,720
but I ran into just different groups of

355
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:57,958
people we had lots of lots of very kind

356
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:03,920
people so I had strains from cabbage man

357
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:05,758
196 69 cage um I had you know strains

358
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,799
from

359
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:14,959
stash um just all kinds of stuff I was

00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:19,198
seeing a lot of um Aloha White Widow

361
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:22,919
crosses seeing a lot of Black Widow G13

362

crosses a lot of G13 gorilla

363
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:29,799
arm oh I remember yes yep back in the

364
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,720
day when we originally started here you

365
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:34,000
know in

366
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,560
Colorado I also was able to Source some

367
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,879
Romulan and some of the Colorado peab

368
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,719
Bud um which back in the day you know

369
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,078
thinking about it I really wish I knew

370
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,319
how to clone and keep plants back then

371
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,799
because there were some real Cherry

372
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:55,198
plants back in the day um we also saw a

373
00:16:52,799 --> 00:17:00,240
tremendous amount of Durban in

374
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:03,639
Colorado um in the late 80s early 990s

375
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,919
um always a pleasure to

376
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:10,720
grow um uh we even ended up getting our

377
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:14,520
own cut somehow or other Colorado has

378
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,240
its own Durban cut um I think not sure

379
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,558
who that's care of maybe Stacy mure oh

380
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,838
Maybe Might Have Been instrumental in

381
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:28,960
that um another real nice guy and then I

382
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:31,839
um was privy to helping

383
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,919
these other two gentlemen run an auction

384
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:38,839
for a gentleman in Australia named Rod

385
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,160
wall um back in the day to help him get

386
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:45,119
out of some troubles so I was kind of

387
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,720
the middleman for I don't know how many

388
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,399
thousands of

389
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,360
seeds that um different members across

390
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,038
the different forms donated to us so we

391
00:17:53,359 --> 00:18:00,918
could have an auction and send him some

392
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:03,599
money and uh so even today in my seed

393
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:06,120

was a whole group including Kirby who

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,919
knew that if they needed clones they

465
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,038
would just call me and come over and I

466
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,159
would just kind of turn my back and they

467
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,558
would just go in my room and made what

468

494
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,918
uh through JoJo's work that he was doing

495
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,678
f2s of or someone else's like NCG yeah

496
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,480
he was doing someone else someone I

497
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,919
forget who originally put out the Aloha

498
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,919
White Widow thought that was

499
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,919
jojojo JoJo yeah yeah sort had a yeah

500
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:28,719
sort of had a lot of mental health

501
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:31,679
issues um he was um super obsessive

502
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,319
compulsive and had paranoia yeah but for

503
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,559
some reason that strain um helped him

504
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:40,720
get through his

505
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:42,599
day so you know he tried Crossing it to

506
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,480
all different kinds of things to see if

507
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,319
he could get a better more vigorous

508
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,919
plant that would help him yeah and in

509
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:52,119
turn um he was one of those people who

510
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,799
posted up on cannabis world you know

511
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:57,558
only minorly but all of his posts were

512
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,240
like oh I just made these crosses and

513
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:02,759
these because as if anybody wants him

514
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,519
yeah and he was constantly sending out

515
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:09,720
seeds to people um I still making the

516
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:13,759
rounds still I still come across a few

517
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,200
people I know who still grow um he had

518
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,480
an Aloha white

519
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,159
widow um Crystal

520
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:26,798
locomotive no no it was uh it might have

521
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:29,799
been my train wreck

522
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,798
but

523
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,880
yeah and I I think he had that cross and

524
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,159
I think he he passed that around a lot

525
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,278
it was again everybody was trying to do

526
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:44,679
their part to make sure everyone in the

527
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:47,519
community had what they

528
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,000
needed yeah his his his uh biggest most

529
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,679
famous one to this day a lot of people

530
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,398
don't know is the grap stomper clone

531
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:54,679
came by a Jojo and it was renamed and

532
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:56,918
stuff but that's where it came from so

533
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:00,519
it's cool to still see it moving around

534
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:04,520
Jojo great strains he remember he had

535
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:07,000
came out with a candy Haze and something

536
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:09,639
other Haze was the Blowfish I thought

537
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,159
Blowfish was Dutch Flowers flowers he

538
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,399
did a lot with Dutch Flowers I've never

539
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,000
been able to unravel it though like he

540
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:18,959
did Blowfish f2s but he also sold seeds

541
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,839
to RC that I think were sold as Dutch

542
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,840
Flowers but I don't even know who Dutch

543
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,759
Flowers was dude dude you're on the

544
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:28,199
great track there Matt I honestly think

545
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,879
that Dutch Flowers was RC

546
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,440
that's what reeferman told me he said

547
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,760
that he I can't confirm that but that's

548
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,640
why hunch dude because yeah you

549
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,839
know to deal with RC a lot right because

550
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,080
you know getting paid and stuff with

551
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,480
them their writing styles were very

552
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,599
similar dude very similar I had some

553
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,200
emails that was like wow dude just the

554
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,839
way they word things right and they had

555
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,440
best descriptions right best description

556
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:58,079
right yeah and speaking of Jojo dude

557
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,759
like such great strains probably went

558
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:04,319
over like 30 35 bucks 40 Buck Max you

559
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,000
know Max dude like nowadays you know you

560
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,398
would just kill for that kind of stuff

561
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,359
and it's like oh yeah dude it it wasn't

562
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,879
about the money back then it really

563
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,798
wasn't it was all about yeah it was kind

564
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,840
of cool to you know get a few bucks you

565
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,240
know because it wasn't a lot of money

566
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,879
but it was just collecting it was like

567
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,440

583
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,319
I'm really enjoying just being a fly on

584
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,720
the wall for this conversation but it

585
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,519
sounds like just such a a radically

586
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,600
different time to where we are right now

587
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:14,079
dude it was it was so different it was

588
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,839
there there you know not going to say

589
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:19,319
there wasn't snakes but we weren't we

590
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,720
weren't privy to them I'm sure like some

591
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,079
of the guys that were really you know

592
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,440
running the the the hard traps and out

593

facing hard if they got caught you know

595
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:35,119
those guys yeah you could see where they

596
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,558
were you know a little closer to the

597
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,398
bestest they wouldn't share as much but

598
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,519
uh it slowly even those guys started

599
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,959
coming out when it seen you know I

600
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:48,679
remember that what was that guy uh with

601

00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,240
pictures blew everybody away no ever

605
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,158

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,798
bro yeah and he would just wouldn't say

607
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,440
anything but then slowly even he would

608
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:11,278
come out right so but for the most part

609
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,720
it there was there was no sketchiness no

610
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,640
one was trying to get a leg up on

611
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,079
anybody it was like dude it's like you

612
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,679
know how he said we just wanted to make

613
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:21,359
sure everybody got a taste of everything

614
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,480
that was going around and get it to

615
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,639
wherever we could I

616
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,599
I I do remember when I first got my

617
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,000
first clones in the mail I think it was

618
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:38,319
T that sent them and I got the sour

619
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,319
diesel the Bubba Kush train wreck

620
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:44,079
Orga help me out here guys wasn't there

621
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,798
two more wasn't it like the Holy Grail

622
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:50,079
of seven strains at the time

623
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:53,558
well I don't know about your end but

624
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,558
dude this was catsu sent me all my gear

625
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:57,519
that I had that I was breeding with and

626
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:00,000
that was maybe part of the seven strs

627
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:04,839
had the Bubba cush East Coast sour

628
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,558
diesel train wreck I had the uh a11 the

629
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:12,278
genius cut um I think I had the

630
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:15,759
chocolate diesel was c99 out yet yeah I

631
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:19,159
had the c99 cut I had uh and that was I

632
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:22,278
believe 180s cut um that was the the

633
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:25,880
most prominent good cut at the time I

634
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:28,440
probably still is to this day um and

635
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,440
dude it was so cool this is how cool it

636
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:35,360
was so katsu's in the states Southern

637
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,200
State not going to say which one he

638
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:41,439
[ __ ] UPS me those clones at 4:20 his

639
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,558
time in a Southern US state and they

640
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,798
arrived in Ontario at my [ __ ] door at

641
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:51,599
4:20 the next

642
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:53,918
day rooted clones dude by a ups dude and

643
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:57,678
we never had that look we have to try

644
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,360
that next time well we never tried UPS I

645
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,278
guess that's true and then like three

646
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,038
years later I called them all When

647
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:07,119
Heaven Stairway got busted because I

648
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:09,720
figured they're coming for us right so

649
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:12,398
lost it all but that's how easy it was

650
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,519
back then and nobody cared like it was

651
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,239
like nobody everybody was looking for

652
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,000
the Holy Grail but everyone wanted to

653
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,640
get it around find everything just get

654
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,839
as many people looking for it as

655
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,240
possible with as many strains popping

656
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:30,439
billions of seeds everybody was from

657
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,599
cbay oh yeah it it was just a wild fun

658
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,600
time and then it got ruined super neat

659
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,959
right it was a real small crowd at the

660
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,599
time much small yeah there there was

661
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,840
there was different people in a group

662
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,558
and depending upon which segment of a

663
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:50,038
group you were in you might get the

664
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:52,200
clones before you know I might get them

665
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:55,000
before D would get them or before skdy

666
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,798
would get them but everybody knew I was

667
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,839
going to give them to skdy or vice versa

668
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:04,158
yeah we had we had guys like raos Ros

669

717
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,038
Model A lot of what your guys' parties

718
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,199
were about how that all worked with

719

clones and bring that into the modern

720
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,519
era so hopefully we do it some justice a

721
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,240
little bit but it sounds like it was a

722
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,440
freaking amazing time to be alive a

723
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,319
little jealous but I'm I'm I'm stoked

724
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,720

well-known things with UD d man is the

796
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,838
spice Brothers era and it was you and a

797
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,920
person named Fett can you talk a little

798
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:15,920
bit about how that came to be sure

799
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:21,079
actually uh Fett was he's he was in

800
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,760
Australia um just a a wild manad for

801
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,880
sure

802
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,160
um yeah we just hit it off because he

803
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,519
was a big

804
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,679
uh indoor grower in Australia which

805
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,800
which you think when you think of

806
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,318
Australia you don't really think indoor

807
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,359
grower you think more like outdoor right

808
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:41,639
but um he and not to say he didn't do

809
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:45,759
outdoor but I don't think the um you

810
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:47,719
know the ground in most of Australia is

811
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,240
indicative of doing outdoor grows like

812
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:51,799
you really need to like you know like an

813
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,399
augur to dig the I think CR is just so

814
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,960
hard you need to condition everything so

815
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,318
dude he was doing indoor stuffff and I

816
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,720
how I stumbled onto him he was posting

817
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:05,519

talking and

830
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,119

Canada I sent him some stuff and next

835
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,960
thing you know it was like he started

836
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,318
breeding some of my stuff I started

837
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,159
breeding some of his stuff and we were

838
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:55,358
like it's a good collab let's put it

839
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:57,279
together and and we did a few just our

840
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,039
own things

841
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,000
and that's right around you know the

842
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,199
time that just about a year maybe two

843
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,639
years before Heaven Stairway went

844
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:11,239
down and brothers Grim went out of

845
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,799
business W they stopped selling seeds on

846
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:15,679
Heaven Stairway yeah anyways right and

847
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,160
dude if you wanted brother Grim seeds

848
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,199
back in the day they were like 150 bucks

849
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,639
a pack like they were top of the line

850
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,318
that was big bucks back then right and

851
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,480
not everybody could obviously afford

852
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:28,639
that so when they stopped selling seeds

853
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,358
and I I knew that because again my close

854
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,679
relationship with RC at the time and uh

855
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:37,440
so we reached out to um Mr Soul at the

856
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,639
time and said dude do do you mind if we

857
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,838
you know knock off some of your strains

858
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,199
make some FPS and send them out on the

859
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,358
cbay for everybody to [ __ ] get you

860
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,039
know a chance to your genetics and sure

861
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:50,000
he gave us permission to do that and

862
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,599
dude that's basically what we did and

863
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,400
that's how we started spice Brothers was

864
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:59,960
just basically knocking off everything

865
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:02,760
Brothers Grim right right and uh dude

866
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,199

Haze again he'd love the sativas I guess

894
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,599
Australia is a good good place to do the

895
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:24,559
sativas Outdoors if you can find the

896
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:27,119
suitable soil to do it uh then uh we

897
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:31,159
just once Heaven Stairway went down he

898
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,559
went over to that um what is that UK

899
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:35,318
place cuz at the same time as Heaven

900
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,960
Stairway was getting busted seeds in the

901
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:42,759
UK became

902
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:46,639
legal Gypsy C Depot no Gypsy no no the

903
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:50,480

904
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:55,078

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,720
yeah he had a forum and he was selling

908
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,400
seeds over in the UK so that's where

909
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,919
faret and I ended up our relationship

910
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,599
ended there right so like like literally

911
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,280
I shut down everything right after

912
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,400
Heaven Stairway went down so yeah so a

913
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,560
lot of

914
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,920
people but I sent uh I sent all my stock

915
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:21,838
to to Doc chronic that was anything

916
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,119
spice Brother related and F and I just

917
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,719
split it up after that and uh dude then

918
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:30,400
he just fell off the face of the Earth I

919
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:32,919
wish I could find that guy I reached out

920
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,240
I I can't find anybody that knows him

921
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,119
the last thing I did here is that he got

922
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:41,318
bit by a black typan oh Jesus and I

923
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,720
think that's pretty pretty rough snake

924
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:45,679
in Australia and I he he made it but I

925
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:52,000
think he got pretty [ __ ] up from that

926
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:53,799
um who is this F oh okay so yeah I don't

927
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,318
know what happened to him dude I've had

928
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,839
people reach out to me over the years

929
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,800
asking where he is and I'm like dude if

930
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:00,480

931
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
looking for him like yeah I would love

932
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,159
to reach out and get a hold of him again

933
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:10,119
right but uh you remember his strain

934
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:13,639
dizzy the aie type y definitely not hies

935
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:16,000

936
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:21,400
weird totally I don't look like weed

937
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,039
weed right yeah yeah the not ABC not ABC

938
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:27,000
right it's not ABC it's not

939
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:28,800
AB never release it

940
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,880
uh he would never even send me any seeds

941
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,599
he crossed that [ __ ] with everything but

942
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,000
uh everybody wanted it but nobody could

943
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,800
get it I wonder why why he held it so

944
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,880
tight I know Hy worked on it too or

945
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,960

946
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,760
not the same yeah uh but again you know

947
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,000

00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:08,920
AG13 um he had very few seeds of it he

981
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:12,358
was building a house and he sent me I

982
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,960
don't know I don't know couple of dozen

983
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:17,598
seeds I worked through them and made

984
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,880
some you know f2s for him and sent him

985
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,480
back like couple thousand seeds and that

986
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,119
was my part with it and he ran with it

987
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,318
from there and made his own selections

988
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,079
and I actually sent him the mom back

989
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,400
with the seeds that I had found so oh

990
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,440
wow yeah cool guy uh he's still in

991
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,720
business now doing lots of good stuff up

992
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,639
here dude like one of the earliest

993
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:38,959
feminized seed sellers that I remember

994
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:41,480
that was in North America uh right up

995
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,639
there with the the classic clone company

996
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,280
from C forgot who they were but they

997
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:48,598
were the first ones to get a hold and

998
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,839
that was uh I think it was hve again you

999
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,519
selling his uh yeah whatever it was yeah

1000
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,400
yeah we we tried it the exe it worked on

1001
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,838
a couple of strains and a couple it

1002
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,119
wouldn't yeah that's that's that's what

1003
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:03,239
people don't realize like with reversals

1004
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,838
like it's not all inclusive no matter

1005
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,000
what spray you're using no matter what

1006
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:09,639
type it's it really is dependent on the

1007
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,358
health of the plant the type of plant

1008
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:15,960
the genetics of the plant how it revers

1009
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:17,679
absolutely abely agree I just found uh I

1010
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,519
don't know if you could see

1011
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:24,679
these yeah I can see those what you got

1012
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:28,000
that is a JoJo candy Haze and this is

1013
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:33,039
something by barefoot Alpha Kush it

1014
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,039
looks like Alpha Kush F

1015
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:41,760
200 I don't I still have some Crystal

1016
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:44,239
locomotive that JoJo did nice I I I'll

1017
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,599
tell you that was a good strain yeah it

1018
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:52,039
was it was a very good strain so were

1019
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,920
his train wreck s1s I love those yeah he

1020
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:57,119
did kill her stuff way way ahead of his

1021
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,920
time he was I honestly think that and

1022
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,039
this is just my opinion I honestly think

1023
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,480
a lot of

1024
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:06,920
the Kush fenos that are going around now

1025
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,119
all came from CB dude those first

1026
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,838
feminized bub crosses I bet that's when

1027
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,119
all of a sudden that you started you

1028
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:18,799
know seeing that KATU found a KATU one

1029
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,200
and then there was Ghost found one and

1030
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,680
then there was the abusive

1031
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,679
and is great right and then they all

1032
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:29,960
just kind of came around around the same

1033
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:32,480
time that that first feminized Bubba

1034
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,679
cush cross came out it just makes you

1035
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,240
things things that make do make a lot of

1036
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,639
sense kind of does right but uh whether

1037
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,039
they are or not I don't know it's just

1038
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:43,960
funny that they were everywhere and

1039
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:45,800
there's so many different fenos and it's

1040
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,280
like well we all know that it's really

1041
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,318
hard to get an identical feno from the

1042
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,680
mall absolutely right you can but it's

1043
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:55,800
there so but there's close and different

1044
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,558
nuances and I think that's my personal

1045
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,880
opin that's a lot The Story Goes is that

1046
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,960
the Bubba Kush seeds that went out were

1047
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,440
half OG Kush and half of a plant called

1048
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,480
Bubba that was in or lights plant so

1049
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,039
like norn lights OG Kush you cross them

1050
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,880
you're GNA get OG Kush Expressions even

1051
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:11,960
in the S1 you know what I mean like

1052
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,880
absolutely and they may not be identical

1053
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,960
to that Mom thata but they're close is

1054
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:23,800
right it's like any S1 right

1055
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:26,119
like the recessive pop out yeah yeah hoe

1056
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,000
you mentioned peab but earlier was did

1057
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,079
you ever hear of it referred to By Any

1058
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,440
Other

1059
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:35,599
Name well no I got to Colorado I lived

1060
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,880
in Wyoming for a number of years before

1061
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:41,079
I came to

1062
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:44,640
Colorado by the time I got here it was

1063
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:47,480
the Colorado pona Bud the peab bud if

1064
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:50,000
you were lucky you knew somebody in that

1065
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,798
specific area or

1066
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,798
somebody you know local who knew

1067
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:59,239
somebody um

1068
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:03,280
and you could get it you know pretty

1069
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:06,759
handily back in the day and um the

1070
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:10,480
Clones were held really tightly by the

1071
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:13,200
group in the valley was not something

1072
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,880
that was readily shared with

1073
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:20,519
Outsiders um at one point um I had the

1074
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,318
Clone um but it was before I had a

1075
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:28,400
medical debacle back before I met most

1076
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:30,558
everybody and and uh I lost pretty much

1077
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,880
everything I had after that and could

1078
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:38,119
not get it back

1079
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:40,200
um I am uh really hopeful ctg who had

1080
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:43,358
was originally from

1081
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:48,759
Colorado um who's now working with some

1082
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:52,759
peab bud that he got from um assorted

1083
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:55,000
sources um and I'm hoping that he gets

1084
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,760
the gets it he's saying it's going in

1085
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,960
the right Direction so I have really

1086
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:05,760
good faith in him as far as his breeding

1087
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:08,838
and abilities go so um it it was uh it

1088
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,400
it was called the ponia paralyzer yeah

1089
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:14,199
there you go there you go you to say it

1090
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,000
yeah it had it had a couple of other you

1091
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:19,000
know schnazzy names depending upon where

1092
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,480
you were I happened to I happen to live

1093
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,280
in the Denver area um but if you went up

1094
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,920
north to like Fort Collins where CSU is

1095
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,319
uh everybody referred to it as the

1096
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,480
paralyzer everybody knew it was the same

1097
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:38,759
bud and um you just could you couldn't

1098
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:42,960
get the Piney taste out of your

1099
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:45,839
mouth uh it was that really thick

1100
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,199
beautiful heavy

1101
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:51,400
smoke um that's perfect for a you know

1102
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,118
nice Colorado night sitting out under

1103
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,039
the stars or under a

1104
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,240
campfire you know um if few years ago

1105
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:01,318
one of

1106
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,919
friends Mir hit me up and he's like hey

1107
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:04,599
I have some um seeds and I didn't know

1108
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,280
who Mir was at the time like that wasn't

1109
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:07,760
from your guys's era I just thought he

1110
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,160
was some guy on Facebook that people

1111
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,000
knew that was kind of old school he's

1112
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,759
like hey I have some Netherland purple

1113
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,719
indicia but I'm pretty sure this is the

1114
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,760
I think he said pona purple paralyzer

1115
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,000
gave me the seeds of it and I was me

1116
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,960
like oh maybe I should give these to

1117
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,358
pebd because he called himself peab bud

1118
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,798
so he's looking for it I've regretted

1119
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,639
that ever since like I want to see in

1120
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:28,880
those

1121
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,480
things I actually gave to my friend Matt

1122
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,680
Elite to give to PE but and I think they

1123
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,358
stayed with Matt for whatever reason so

1124
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:35,960
they may be coming back so I'm pretty

1125
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:39,000
stoked about that see if we can get it

1126
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,119
back yeah thumbs up there I'll tell you

1127
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,358
what your

1128
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:45,680
luck you know and like d said yeah it

1129
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:49,519
may not be a perfect expression of what

1130
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:54,358
what it was but it's just like uh it's

1131
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:55,920
just like anything it's um you you

1132
00:51:54,358 --> 00:52:01,000
know

1133
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:03,559
SGP it's still good pot right you know

1134
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,039
we were joking about that you know uh

1135
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:09,559
with the East Coast sour d which we got

1136
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:11,440
back you know not that long ago and a

1137
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,440
whole lot of people were like oh it kind

1138
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,440

1142
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,760
fact that the name is from a 20-year-old

1143
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:32,920
strain like evaluate it based on what it

does for you you know I mean it's still

1145

1200
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:06,118
years I mean you know so so I did have

1201
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:10,920
the racco lodge open before we did the

1202
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:13,480
Cabana yeah yeah dude okay I yeah and

1204
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,119
remember all the people that were there

1205
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,160
that AR you know we are we ar

1206
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:26,519
necessarily in total contact with every

1207
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:29,798
day now but I mean we had know bud

1208
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:32,838
meiser and we had you know moonshine and

1209
00:55:29,798 --> 00:55:35,199
Dr you know Mr dank or Dr dank or what

1210
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:37,119
you know we had we had the doctor you

1211
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,399
know that's that's before the doctor

1212
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,160
came and the reason he came and stayed

1213
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,280
at my house is because he met me you

1214
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:46,199
know through the Raccoon

1215
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,200
Lodge you know uh when you know when he

1216
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:51,480
needed a place to crash out here and

1217
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:54,000
same as you you know like you know the

1218
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,719
Raccoon Lodge tightened up a lot of our

1219
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
friendships you know that we already had

1220
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:02,439
because we moved from kind of becoming

1221
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,880
friends in public and then being forced

1222
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:09,000
into a private kind of smaller world

1223
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:12,039
where some of us really bonded very well

1224
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,239
together how the The Refuge of overgrows

1225
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,079
this how essentially the as we're

1226
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,558
getting into this the Raccoon Lodge into

1227
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:23,920
the canic Cabana started then yeah we

1228
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:27,440
were in TCB first wasn't that and then

1229
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,318
TCB with clips and

1230
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,920
C nugs yes

1231
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:37,000
running and when they discontinued

1232
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,480
that's when I think yall said Steve open

1233
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,920
up a raccoon

1234
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,519
Lodge something Incorporated everybody

1235
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,440
from there into the Raccoon Lodge and I

1236
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,440
think at that time that's when cannabis

1237
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,639
world where we were all mostly hanging

1238
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,679
out it was starting to get crazy like

1239
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:56,159
you know there was the trolls from

1240
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,358
overgrow were St starting to Mo you know

1241
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,879
migrate over to you know I think there

1242
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:04,318
was a shark tank at cannabis world to it

1243
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,798
just started getting messy and it was

1244
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,920
like you know that's when the sharing

1245
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:12,199
was became a lot more private and where

1246
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,920
the private sites came in much handier

1247
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,679
right like you didn't want to really

1248
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,039
broadcast so much then

1249
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:21,279
exactly people were starting to realize

1250
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,319
that it took work to find fenos and they

1251
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,559
weren't so willing to just willy-nilly

1252
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:28,159
throw them out there to just

1253
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:31,440
a lot people started hoard strains

1254
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:33,358
absolutely right well you know well and

1255
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,159
again depending upon your perspective

1256
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:36,480
because I remember at one of the big

1257
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:41,920
parties in

1258
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:44,318
California when you know I I first met

1259
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,039
you know uh

1260
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:51,639
inspector and um you know he was

1261
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:54,319
explaining to me how he was a third

1262
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:56,358
generation grower and that some of the

1263
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:59,199
strange were in his family from his

1264
00:57:56,358 --> 00:58:01,558
grandfather's time yeah and that he had

1265
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:05,960
made a family commitment not to share

1266
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:08,000
them at that time um till he you know

1267
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,519
till you know he had an agreement with

1268
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,519
his father and grandfather that you know

1269
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:16,239
they would come a point where he would

1270
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:18,559
share them but it it wasn't then and he

1271
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,719
was trying to explain to me that so does

1272
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,839
it make

1273
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:25,838
me you know a greedy person if I can't

1274
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:28,798
share something that promised my father

1275
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:31,519
and grandfather I wouldn't share no dude

1276
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:34,719
it doesn't you know I I hold the man

1277
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:37,559
he's a really great great guy and I

1278
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:40,759
really love him for his principles he

1279
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:44,000
was very firm in what he could and

1280
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:48,520
couldn't share and you know he developed

1281
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,920
that into a a huge you know situation

1282
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:54,038
like he's got going on now and you know

1283
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,960
God bless him he you know he didn't

1284
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:58,359
betray his face family he didn't portray

1285
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:01,039
his morals and he was able to do what he

1286
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:03,838
you know he's still now and now he's

1287
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:06,599
sharing those genetics yeah but he's

1288
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:08,159
very still very very Hardline honest

1289
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,680
probably one of the biggest influences

1290
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,519
in my life on uh what I what i' model my

1291
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:16,118
character and and how I carry myself uh

1292
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:17,960
he is the most honest person I know it's

1293
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,440
crazy I've seen people accidentally you

1294
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,079
know send him

1295
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,599
$14,000 and and him return it because

1296
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,880
they didn't put you know what they

1297
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,400
wanted and he doesn't want to give the

watched we watch I'll just say for the

1342
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,280
record when it came down to whose idea

1343
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,358
it was for the secret mods at the Cabana

1344
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,240
if Kendall thinks it was his idea

1345
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,199
honestly dude that was [ __ ] 18 years

1346
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:42,118
ago I don't know whose idea it was if he

1347
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,960
says it was his he's probably right and

1348
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,960
kudos to him for thinking about it the

1349
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,679
only thing I'll say about that was was

1350
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,000
it was shitty for me because all the

1351
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:52,078
mods were hidden but it was me that

1352
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,719
always had to go deliver the bad news or

1353
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,920

01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:08,880

1389
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:29,078
Reborn The Rebirth of the Cabana I think

1390
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,318
so yeah saw he's still around yeah he's

1391
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:34,039
still around so in terms of timeline

1392
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:38,119
when was the the original kind of

1393
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:43,119
inception of the Cabana December the 2nd

1394
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:45,559
2006 my birthday wow yeah right I was

1395
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,039
coming online that's how I remember it

1396
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:50,319
yeah when uh cannabis World went down we

1397
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:54,680
went over to the Raccoon Lodge Kitty

1398
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:58,159
skdy hosted us there and uh we we sort

1399
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:59,798
of just reached out to some members at

1400
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:02,399
the Raccoon Lodge who we thought would

1401
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:05,559
be a good fit you know like Muggles and

1402
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:10,358
you know old so and you know buckweed

1403
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:12,760
and Howie and obviously everybody

1404
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:15,199
Ander we had a bunch of people help us

1405
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,920
in the beginning you know absolutely and

1406
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:18,318
then we just banged it out over five

1407
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,480
months there you know we were just

1408
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:22,920
racking ideas off each other's head what

1409
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,599
would work what wouldn't work that's

1410
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:28,519
where we kind of realized you know we

1411
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:30,960
didn't want a shark tank no no politics

1412
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:33,920
no politics uh we obviously thought that

1413
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:37,639
you know Firearms wasn't a good fit and

1414
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,720
uh uh we were we were unique like that

1415
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:41,639
AB from some of the other sites

1416
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:43,439
absolutely and I think a lot of people

1417
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:46,199
didn't like us like that we were known

1418
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:49,079
as the Carebears I think the

1419
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:51,078
carear uh because it stood the test of

1420
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,519
time though like doing it a certain way

1421
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:54,278
keeping it a certain way keeping a

1422
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:56,278
private all those years letting certain

1423
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:57,920
people in sounds like you did it like an

1424
01:04:56,278 --> 01:05:00,599
onion where there were layers and you

1425
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,278
involv certain people in fit better and

1426
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,000
and molded better yeah absolutely and

1427
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,920
when we first opened it you know we it

1428
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,639
was sort of like if I'm not mistaken

1429
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,358
these guys can correct me it was sort of

1430
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:11,598
like we left the threads open somebody

1431
01:05:10,358 --> 01:05:13,519
would nominate somebody in and they

1432
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,880
would kind of like get a vote on it and

1433
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:17,798
then we started realizing that that's

1434
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,720
not really fair you know everybody sort

1435
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:21,719
of deserves a second chance if if a

1436
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:23,838
member a current member is vouching for

1437
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:25,798
them well they're putting their account

1438
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,719
on the line we felt that was good enough

1439
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:30,519
so we just started locking those threads

1440
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:32,399
for nominations if somebody wanted you

1441
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:34,519
in dude you were in it was simple as

1442
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,760
that

1443
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:40,920
yeah and it worked good that way for a

1444
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:45,440
long time we had a lot of participation

1445
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:47,680
and then when Colorado went legal then a

1446
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,119
lot of people came in from Colorado like

1447
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:53,199
so it just like a boom that's when Kirby

1448
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:57,720
and you know Green mofo and all those

1449
01:05:53,199 --> 01:06:00,038
guys even back Big Sir it was just it

1450
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:02,000
was we had influx of members there right

1451
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:05,240
is that when Tiara Rojo got

1452
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,719
into Roo came in Paco came in for a

1453
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:10,038
while came in everybody came in for a

1454
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:13,199
little while especially a anybody who

1455
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:17,760

1456
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:20,278

1463
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:40,520
great to see um just the fact that

1464
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:44,679

1465
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:47,679
interest we were you know we were on a I

1466

for a lot of years and had everything

1469
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,679
going pretty good but but you know uh as

1470
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,798
people age in attrition and you don't

1471
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:03,919
have as many older members meeting new

1472
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:07,239
people to invite

1473
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:10,880
in we became kind of the road to you

1474
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:11,959
know self defeating prophecy where you

1475
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,720

1476
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:17,679
was you know I was asking people for

1477
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:20,719
donations and looking at the thing as a

1478
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:22,598
dinosaur like when when do we go extinct

1479
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:26,038
when we run out of when we run out of

1480
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:29,039
donations yeah the key the key to me is

1481
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:32,119
kind of like what do what do I do to

1482

help lead the ship into a new era

1483
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:38,119
and you know that's where curbs comes in

1484
01:07:35,278 --> 01:07:40,000
you know the the the line on the story

1485

you know when did you guys start talking

1486
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,519
about doing that with curb about maybe

1487
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,960
Changing Hands he he approached

1488
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:50,278
me in all honesty to my my two friends

1489
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:54,480
sitting here in all honesty Kirby

1490
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:56,000
approached me last year last summer um

1491
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,880
early in the

1492
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,159
summer um Steve was having an off

1493
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:06,599
season Darren was in the

1494
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:09,519
hospital I kind of hinted something to

1495
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:12,760
Darren about it way back then and he

1496
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:16,679
seemed really amable to potentially

1497
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:20,359
letting Kirby you know take

1498
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:23,600
over but Steve's POS you know situation

1499
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:27,719
was such that he and I weren't able to

1500
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:32,199
actually communicate out you know what

1501
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,798
Kirby wanted to do so I kind of kept it

1502
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:36,479
in the back of my head and I literally

1503
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:39,039
said to Kirby you know give me some time

1504
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,000
you know let let Darren get out of the

1505
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:46,158
hospital let you know let Steve get

1506
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:49,359
through his stuff everything everything

1507
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:53,358
magically worked itself out and Kirby

1508
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:55,560
actually called me that week and said

1509
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,520

1510
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,839

1511
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,839

1512
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:03,719

1513
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:06,719

1514
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:10,600
Friday Y and

1515
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:13,239
uh then called Cur back and said dude

1516
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,640

1517
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:18,439
a plan you've got an idea it'll save us

1518
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,079
from going

1519
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:24,798
extinct I really like the

1520
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:26,000
concept we've always worried you know as

1521
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:29,359
we've gotten

1522
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,798
older things have become more legal when

1523
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,880
Darren originally took this thing on

1524
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:37,399
under his belt he had to worry about

1525
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:40,000
Canadian laws Canadian

1526
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:43,039
police I was living here in Colorado

1527
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,560
where things were always fairly

1528
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,319
mellow Steve who was bouncing from

1529
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,640
Louisiana to New York and then

1530
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:54,600
eventually ended up here thanks to you

1531
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:57,480
know some coaxing from my family and I

1532
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,039
yes got him out to a good place you know

1533
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:00,718
a place we knew he'd be able to

1534
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,880
establish

1535
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,960
and here we all are you know it's years

1536
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,520
later and the S side still running

1537
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:10,679
itself just fine when I took it over it

1538
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:14,040
was still running itself just fine

1539
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:17,800
nothing wrong with the site except that

1540
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:19,198
as older members pass and we've lost a

1541
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,039
lot of good

1542
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:24,479
people as people's situations change and

1543
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:27,920
they leave and don't come back

1544
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:32,119
back you've got you know a handful of

1545
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:35,679

because we had such old V bulletin

1603
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,158
software at the the command it was like

1604
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,480
it was really hard to post pictures

1605
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:04,679
because it really sucked right it hard

1606

01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:37,600

1619
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:39,760
well I've got six sorry I've got 6,000

1620
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,920
followers on Instagram and any time I

1621
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:45,880
make a post nice 10 10 people like it

1622
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:48,600
yeah know it's like I just like dude I'm

1623
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,639
not even a big guy you know it just says

1624
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,679
I sell cannabis seeds or you know I

1625
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:55,880
breed cannabis seeds and that's enough

1626
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,800
algorithm says no [ __ ] you dude you

1627
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,679
nobody I know the feeling yeah not even

1628
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:03,480
your followers right so it's like yeah

1629
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:06,480
it sucks dude and I see like all these

1630
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:08,959
big accounts you know like like CSI and

1631
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,718
you know like he's

1632
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,480
got you know a quarter of a million

1633
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:15,279
followers and he's got like you know

1634
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:16,399
five accounts and they all have the same

1635
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:18,479
because they're all backup accounts

1636
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:20,759
because one gets banned or shut down and

1637
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:23,479
he just has to start it's just it's a

1638
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:26,199
Time suck dude it really it's really bad

1639
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:28,799
and that's when came in and said dude

1640
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:30,960
let's make the forums relevant again you

1641
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,360
know you can post pictures and on the

1642
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,560
Forum it doesn't really it was never

1643
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:37,399
about

1644
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:40,159
pictures for for the rebranding or the

1645
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:43,519
rebirth it was just about you know the

1646
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:45,359
comments making it more uh relevant for

1647
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,600
the communication of the plant you know

1648
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,719
on Instagram you can't do that you know

1649
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,480
so one I'll interrupt here and just say

1650
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:54,079
that one thing we've discussed in the

1651
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:55,718
past is like how kind of going back to

1652
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,079
some of the early points you guys made

1653
01:14:55,719 --> 01:15:00,480
how well connected you all were and how

1654
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,399
meaningful those connections were uh one

1655
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,599
thing about Instagram is obviously

1656
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:07,638
everyone's quite alienated and quite

1657
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,880
isolated and you have these very uh

1658
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:11,359
brief interactions with people on a post

1659
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,800
and then the next day it's gone right I

1660
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:14,439
mean not it's not gone but like you're

1661
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,560
gonna have to go find it in the abyss of

1662
01:15:14,439 --> 01:15:17,759
the

1663
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:20,280
timeline and so you don't really have

1664
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,679
that kind of accumulation of history as

1665
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:24,319
you would on a forum

1666
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,039
thread or or the the interaction you

1667
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:27,639
know from the original poster whoever

1668
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:29,158
posts that awesome pick you know they

1669
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:32,079
can post their little description of

1670
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:34,319
what this is but it's not indicative of

1671
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:37,000
having a conversation you know or or

1672
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:39,519
even asking a question you know it's

1673
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,198
like we need the help desks again we

1674
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,880
need these breeders to have their own

1675
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:46,039
fors where they can you know communicate

1676
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:48,560
with their customers and it's just like

1677
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:50,560
if you look at the Ganda now just about

1678
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,239
every breeder that has their own form

1679
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,920
there dude they've been an original

1680
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:59,759
member like great either from inception

1681
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:01,600
or from the Colorado influx of 2012 like

1682
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,920
you know and some of these guys are

1683
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,960
[ __ ] huge breeders right like so as

1684
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:09,480
we all know and that's what they need if

1685
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,079
we can get content there and get their

1686
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:14,000
customers to come and interact with them

1687
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:16,039
we know they're busy people but you know

1688
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,439
even like inspecta dude he's chiming in

1689
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:18,880
people are posting stuff about his

1690
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:22,319
strains and that's what we wanted we

1691
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:25,239
wanted place for the Breeders to be able

1692
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,960
to talk to the customers you know and

1693
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:29,799
and answer some

1694
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,399
questions like it used to be you know

1695
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,279
like get away from the Instagram yeah

1696
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:36,960
you can post the pretty pictures there

1697
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:38,920
but we know that when you know inspector

1698
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,679
posts a pick dude it's not hitting a

1699
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,319
quarter of a million followers like ex

1700
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:47,920
it's if he hits

1701
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:50,000
1% maybe two% I don't know like whereas

1702
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,359
you know I'm not saying you I'm not

1703
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,479
being naive saying that we're going to

1704
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:56,279
replace Instagram it's not a about the

1705
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:59,718
pitchers at the command it's about the

1706
01:16:56,279 --> 01:17:01,719
interaction and about even the smaller

1707
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:03,480
guys like these upand cominging breeders

1708
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:07,039
that's who we really want to help give

1709
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:08,839
them a platform that Instagram can't do

1710
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,319
like these guys are just a shadow band

1711
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,560
with you know a thousand followers just

1712
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:14,639
because they're posting cannabis

1713
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,800
pictures well come over to the Cabana

1714
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:20,440

1715
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,440
ring dude post your seeds post your

1716

01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:27,000
eventually you know hopefully have a

1718
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,960
maybe sort of like a cbay kind of

1719
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,158
platform you know like that would be

1720
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,840
cool for up and cominging breeders again

probably some giveaways you know we're

1745
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,199
going to have some Cabana packs things

1746
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,600
like that with some seeds maybe from

1747
01:18:32,198 --> 01:18:36,279
some upand cominging

1748
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,360
breeders you know we just want to see

1749
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:40,800
people posting their grows and if we can

1750
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:43,079
help like as we still know lots of

1751
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,600
people are still just new Growers right

1752
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:46,079
now we're seeing it in the Cabana you

1753
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,800
know people are saying I'm just got two

1754
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:50,479
or three grows under my belt this is

1755
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,440
kind of cool it's like yeah we forgot

1756
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:54,879
about that you know we all got so tired

1757
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:57,359
of answering the same old questions over

1758
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,079
and over again that we forget that dude

1759
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:03,000
we have to pass this knowledge on yeah

1760
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:04,600
we can't we can't just not you know

1761
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,920
can't rely on other people just to do it

1762
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:09,079
for us they're probably more new Growers

1763
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:13,480
now than ever

1764
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:16,399
before definitely Point yeah

1765
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:19,759
um and they have so many more tools than

1766
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:22,719
we had right you know LED lights and you

1767
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,239
know yeah all all the cool toys to have

1768
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,840
right

1769
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:27,678
and so everybody knows Kirby was

1770
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:31,600
supposed to be here but he got stuck in

1771
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:33,199
an airport so yes a separate episode

1772
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,400
with him or another one of these because

1773
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,359
there's there's so much absolutely we

1774
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:38,759
got to get Kirby here because you know

1775
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,519
we can we can give you the whole history

1776
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:44,560
of how we got to the gavana but it's

1777
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,800
Kirby's idea and his baby from here dude

1778
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:49,920
and he's got big plans and he's going to

1779
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,119
make forums relevant again you know like

1780
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,000
we're not going to say we're going after

1781
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:57,039
other forums but dude we're going after

1782
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,560
other forms yeah yeah the the ones that

1783
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:01,600
were there like I I don't have any good

1784
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,880
relationship with them honestly my my

1785
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,520
whole my whole relationship with that

1786
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,800
was I would go to a forum it was usually

1787
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,239
run by someone who ran a seed bank

1788
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,159
they'd see I have a seed company if I

1789
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:14,238
don't interact with them in certain ways

1790
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:16,198
I'd be banned and that's really my my

1791
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:18,119
whole experience of form didn't happen

1792
01:20:16,198 --> 01:20:19,719
that way with you guys and that's really

1793
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:21,719
what happened at the Cabana you know the

1794
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:23,679
original because that was part of the

1795
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:25,560
other things that we had like we said no

1796
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:28,239
seed sales you know we didn't want any

1797
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:31,480
seed spam so we literally by policy

1798
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:33,519
pushed all of our

1799
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:35,479
friends I'm still scared of post and

1800
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,159
Seed stuff there bro like it feels so

1801
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:42,718
weird it's all good now dude Kirby said

1802
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:44,039
it's good to go Rowdy NY Rowdy NY he's

1803
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,119
retired dude

1804
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:52,960
we but the reality is

1805
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:55,880
that we need a new approach to move

1806
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:59,719
ahead the dinosaur either collapses and

1807
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:02,319
goes extinct or we move ahead

1808
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:04,960
having had all those parties and

1809
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:07,759
interacted with a lot of guys who are 20

1810
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:11,439
or 30 years younger than me who have

1811
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:14,000
other aspirations and ideas which I

1812
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:17,000
wasn't thinking about or didn't didn't

1813
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,639
ever think about I guess um you know

1814
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:23,359
really brings a whole new perspective to

1815
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:25,679
what what we want to do we don't

1816
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:29,319
you know we remember the days when at

1817
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:33,039
seed Bay you know like if you bought

1818
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:35,079
something from you know doc green thumbs

1819
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,960
and you had a question and you posted up

1820
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:41,960

1822
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:49,399
you get either him to answer himself or

1823
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,279
one of his helpers or you know a group

1824
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:55,599
of four or five other people would jump

1825
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:57,800
in and answer and try to help and that's

1826
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,199
part of what you know is missing out

1827
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,000
there is yeah it's easy to go buy a pack

1828
01:22:00,198 --> 01:22:03,960
of

1829
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,198
seeds but what do you expect from it

1830
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,119
yeah you know and it's good to have

1831
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:10,158
people you know I mean that's how my

1832
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:12,920
relationship with d my relationship with

1833
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:15,719
Moto Rebel you know was all based on

1834
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:18,679
beta testing they relied on me to be

1835
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:21,319
honest which I brutally

1836
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:25,158
was

1837
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:28,319
both and you know and I and I always

1838
01:22:25,158 --> 01:22:30,839
tried to be as descriptive as I could so

1839
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:33,238
if somebody put themselves in my shoes

1840
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,079
you know all right I'm gonna grow a few

1841
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:37,158

these I could give them an easy way show

1843
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:42,920

1847
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:52,639

next morning and drove to Colorado and

1944
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:05,678
ended up at Ho's house with a giant

1945
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,639
truck in front of its house I should

1946
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:11,079
still think about that horrible

1947
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,639
woman anyway sorry to Sidetrack that was

1948
01:27:11,079 --> 01:27:16,439
just a funny funny story of moving skidy

1949
01:27:13,639 --> 01:27:20,079
out New York to Denver she was kind of a

1950
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:22,839
Top Cop she actually escorted Escobar

1951
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:25,319
when he was no no no um

1952
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:28,760
who's the one that they brought here and

1953
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:32,039
Chapo El Chapo Chapo she escorted El

1954
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:34,719
Chapo at one point if I'm not mistaken

1955
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:36,560
and she made made herself a name with

1956
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:39,560
that

1957
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,560
now

1958
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:46,199
uninvolved in said truck you guys left

1959
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:51,679
out a very important part of the

1960
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:54,638
story so you know Darren left Steve's

1961
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:58,039
house and New York headed for

1962
01:27:54,639 --> 01:28:00,760
Colorado and you know the average speed

1963
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:05,279
limit between here and there is

1964
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:07,079
like oh you know 65 to as much as 75

1965
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:11,599
miles an

1966
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:14,639
hour Darren calls me from I want to say

1967
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:18,440
it was like somewhere near Ames

1968
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:22,199
Iowa seems like he should be

1969
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:25,638
closer why the truck wouldn't move out

1970
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:27,839
of low gear oh no it's it's got a

1971
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:31,239
governor on it right so this truck is

1972
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:34,159
it's not doing more than 55 on a

1973
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:36,638
downhill slope

1974
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:41,559
dude I remember going through the

1975
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:44,239
Poconos like [ __ ] a crawl up [ __ ]

1976
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,360
10 miles hour like dude this is gonna

1977
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:47,718
take me [ __ ] forever what did I sign

1978
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:50,719
up

1979
01:28:47,719 --> 01:28:52,760

1980
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,800

1981
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:58,400
to stay an extra day in New York and

1982
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:00,039
Darren was on a time schedule to get

1983
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:01,960
this done then he had to be back to

1984
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:04,519
Canada oh

1985
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:07,880
wow well like you said that's a brother

1986

a month or whenever till I rented my

1991

1992
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:24,199
forums could could lead and I'm sure

1993

switching over to the new sen4 software

2051
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:57,198
and all that oh I bet sky skdy has been

2052
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:59,359
like the go-to guy we've been rocking

2053
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:02,359
his socks off dude and he's just been

2054
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:04,599
like a trooper I'm

2055
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:06,960
thegeek we're still waiting to get the

2056
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:10,960
rest of our smilees back but we'll get

2057
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,960
there one day I'm sure I've been

2058
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:17,759
busy I had a

2059
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,520
hard I was going to say too that uh for

2060
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,199
our little collaboration here this is

2061
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,920
also potentially just a beginning like I

2062
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:25,039
don't know EX what kinds of shows we'll

2063
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,760
do with the Cabana and you guys in the

2064
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,560
future but I can see lots of

2065
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:31,079
possibilities like we could do

2066
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:33,920
little uh highlight segments from the

2067
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:35,519
Cabana we could do really topical ones

2068
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,079
if you guys want we could let you guys

2069
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,960
host your own show if you want so I

2070
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:42,118
think there's lots of interesting

2071
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:45,158
opportunities to come I think three of

2072
01:32:42,118 --> 01:32:46,679
us might like to do some comedy

2073
01:32:45,158 --> 01:32:50,158
skits

2074
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:52,319
together you guys you guys is like uh uh

2075
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:54,879
what do you call it symbiotic nature

2076
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:58,559
with each other and how how each other's

2077

2080

2162
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:44,800
oh my God now it's over my head we

2163
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:46,359
talking a strain yeah it was a specific

2164
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,800
stra that was passed out there I think

2165
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:50,519
it was a mass super

2166
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,320
scum I I don't remember that one no I

2167

don't remember that one either but there

2168
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:58,079
are so many in lot during my era yeah

2169
01:36:55,399 --> 01:37:00,799
yeah that's

2170
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:02,399
funny well sometimes it's hard for us to

2171
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,159
stay relevant because we want to still

2172
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:08,839
grow the old school strains where a lot

2173
01:37:05,158 --> 01:37:10,479
of people just like 1980 just called

2174
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:13,360
they said they want their pounds

2175
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:16,799
[Laughter]

2176
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:19,439
back um and that's the thing for me dude

2177
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,560
I I popped so many seeds and including

2178
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:24,479
so many of so much of my own gear it's

2179
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:27,960
just hard to remember standouts like

2180
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:31,319
there were so many standouts but you

2181
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:34,198
know you're always just moving on CH so

2182
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:35,840
many seeds and and if you didn't pop

2183
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:39,000
them like as we know they're just going

2184
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,679
to go to waste dude like yes still even

2185
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,639
me you know ien I haven't bred a seed

2186
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:46,800
since 2017 and 2018 and I literally have

2187
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,520
like millions of seeds like what am I

2188
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,119
going to [ __ ] do with them right it's

2189
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:54,760
like I live and and and story of my life

2190
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:57,759
I've given away far more seeds than I've

2191
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:59,880
ever sold like I think we all have

2192
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,239
right

2193
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,319
buiness I gave away like most of my

2194
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:06,598
collection because they were just going

2195
01:38:03,319 --> 01:38:08,719
to go stale just like these JoJo packs

2196
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:11,760
or the JoJo over there which is I'm at

2197
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:14,880
that point too 20 years old it's like

2198
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,480
yeah well and not everybody stored

2199
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,359
everything good so I'm hoping that you

2200
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:21,879
know there you know tissue culture or

2201
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:23,920
embryo Resurrection

2202
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:25,920
yeah maybe that's something you know

2203
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:28,239
dude cuz I am sitting on some pretty old

2204
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,118
seats that were not stored properly that

2205
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:33,319
I just would love to get to you know

2206
01:38:30,118 --> 01:38:35,439
some free 911 stuff but that's you gotta

2207
01:38:33,319 --> 01:38:39,079
keep

2208
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:41,439
cross I have stuff dude from you know

2209
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:44,399
that goes back to the late 90s

2210
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:47,079
ridiculous right start busting some

2211
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:51,319
seeds man some of the original stuff

2212
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:55,039
that we got and I I wouldn't even know

2213
01:38:51,319 --> 01:38:58,639
what to do with it if I germed it you

2214
01:38:55,039 --> 01:39:01,118
know I have such limited capacities to

2215
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,800
do that I gotta find somebody who wants

2216
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:04,238
them though that's the problem send me a

2217
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,800
list we'll find some people that'll pop

2218
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:09,799
them for sure that's probably the idea I

2219
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:12,000
forget I forget who said it but it was

2220
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:14,960
one of the the wisest you know comments

2221
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,840
I ever heard or read on a forum was that

2222
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,158
if everybody just took a single pack out

2223
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:23,159
of their collection and just started

2224
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:25,559
them just one talk everybody and just

2225
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:28,799
see what's there dude we could find the

2226
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:30,719
new new from the [ __ ] old time right

2227
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,480
like and that's all it would take you

2228
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:35,800
know few thousand people just popping a

2229
01:39:33,479 --> 01:39:39,519
pack from like the [ __ ] early

2230
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:42,320
2000s yep absolutely kill cookies and

2231
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,679
kill cook thank you thank you I'm on

2232
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:46,759
that path man like I I'm still on the

2233
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:48,599
blueberry path where we like finding old

2234
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:51,159
blueberry for me meant the world you

2235
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:52,960
know and finally we locked it down got

2236
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:54,638
something that's true truly blueberry

2237
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,118
tasting and smelling and you could pop a

2238
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:58,239
pack of seeds and they're all clones of

2239
01:39:56,118 --> 01:40:00,920
each other you know oh that's cool dude

2240
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:03,919
long time to get that that Tony guy his

2241
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:06,480
blueberry was [ __ ] so he originally

2242
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,760
sourced his from DJ Short so it was the

2243
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:10,638
same stuff but it was it was a very

2244
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,360
early generation before it was super

2245
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:15,400
inbred with just a few plants it was

2246
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:17,039
before that so it still had a lot of

2247
01:40:15,399 --> 01:40:19,359
open space you could still find that

2248
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,198
super actually blueberry smelling

2249
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:24,079

2304
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:48,359
real blueberry plant that doesn't smell

2305
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:50,880
like skunk doesn't smell like anything

2306
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:52,359
else but just truly blueberry jam it

2307
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:55,159
blows people's minds when they smell it

2308
01:42:52,359 --> 01:42:58,759
and see it taste it my story was when I

2309
01:42:55,158 --> 01:43:01,399
was living in New Orleans I lived in a

2310
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:03,639
50y old house and I had a grow in the

2311
01:43:01,399 --> 01:43:06,920
back bedroom back of the house

2312
01:43:03,639 --> 01:43:10,239
overlooking the backyard and if I was

2313
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:12,760
down outside in the backyard I could

2314
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:15,519
smell the one or two blueberry plants

2315
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:17,840
over everything else growing in the room

2316
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:20,760
at that point those were the first seeds

2317
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:22,960
I ever got actually this is even well

2318
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:25,239
before I was on the Internet or anything

2319
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:29,079
and a friend of a friend went to

2320
01:43:25,238 --> 01:43:31,039
Amsterdam and brought back SE there one

2321
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:35,800
strain was mind

2322
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:35,800
control one was Valley

2323
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:41,279
Girl maybe it was just the two strains

2324
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:44,000
but it was a there was valley girl and

2325
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:47,198
the mind control and they were both

2326
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,479
phenomenal strains yeah and of course

2327
01:43:47,198 --> 01:43:51,399
the lost to history at least for me but

2328
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:53,238
we still talk about the weed me and some

2329
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:57,279
old friends to the

2330
01:43:53,238 --> 01:44:00,839
St but why did I even bring that up um

2331
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:03,880
blueberry smelling out the window okay

2332
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:06,840
yeah the Dutch the Dutch cluster the D

2333
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,800
it was a room full room full of valley

2334
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:12,000
girl and just a couple of bluberry

2335
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:14,800
plants would just overtake all that

2336
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,520
strain I'd smell and this is before I

2337
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,760
was smart enough to use carbon filters

2338
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:22,480
or even knew about carbon

2339
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:25,920
filters was barely on the internet then

2340
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:30,399
and so I had like a real stink going on

2341
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:31,960
man and fortunately it was in a part of

2342
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:35,439
town where no one probably either gave a

2343
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:37,279
[ __ ] or if anything they would not nark

2344
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:40,079
me out just rob my

2345
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:42,359
house anyway this is way back in my

2346
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:46,079
ghetto growing career back back in the

2347
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:49,759
day uh I was growing with 4inch Rockall

2348
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:51,079
cubes in rows of rain gutters that I set

2349
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:55,039
up on a

2350
01:44:51,079 --> 01:44:57,238
tilt with one gutter at the end to catch

2351
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:59,359
from all the other drains going into a

2352
01:44:57,238 --> 01:45:04,000
reservoir

2353
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:06,519
and for as horrible as the system really

2354
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,880
was it got some really good results this

2355
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:09,599
was

2356
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:13,800

01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:36,359
skdy he's gonna tell you no exp way you

2411
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,279
want the results you gota you gotta

2412
01:47:36,359 --> 01:47:40,799
follow the recipe it's like Bak good

2413
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:43,479
good baked goods you know and that's why

2414
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:48,719
people will wait for skinny pox right

2415
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:51,319
because they know yep um and that's also

2416
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:53,439
why you'll hear hear me rant one day

2417
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:55,759
about all this crop steering crap with

2418
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:57,638
where they push the high ppms I hope

2419
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:01,119
none of you guys are super crop steering

2420
01:47:57,639 --> 01:48:03,599
fans because no I can rip on it and

2421
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:07,359
Darren many years ago Darren talked me

2422
01:48:03,599 --> 01:48:11,679
into trying a very low PPM grow with my

2423
01:48:07,359 --> 01:48:14,679
rock bull less is more less is more more

2424
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:17,480
and while I did switch to EC instead of

2425
01:48:14,679 --> 01:48:20,599
PPM anymore I still keep it low and I

2426
01:48:17,479 --> 01:48:22,158
grow it like a 1.0 I try telling the

2427
01:48:20,599 --> 01:48:23,760
same thing like like you don't

2428
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:25,439
necessarily need to raise the nutrients

2429
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:28,079
until it's telling you to do it until

2430
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:30,719
you see exact why would you push like

2431
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:32,118
that you get the resins and the flavors

2432
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,480
and everything once you start pushing

2433
01:48:32,118 --> 01:48:36,719
that you lose it to trade out for weight

2434
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:37,759
and everything else exactly and then

2435
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:40,118
they're

2436
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:43,560
like oh my God they're getting like a

2437
01:48:40,118 --> 01:48:45,960
runoff of three point something yeah

2438
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,159
right are you are you buying it for good

2439
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:50,960
weed or are you buying it for biomass

2440
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:54,279
right biomass right yeah they're growing

2441
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:55,800
it for the biomass I I think yeah they

2442
01:48:54,279 --> 01:48:58,198
really are it's like you know they're

2443
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:00,440
all using you know I guess salt

2444
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:03,039
nutrients nowadays I guess got really

2445
01:49:00,439 --> 01:49:06,919
popular whatever bulk whatever I still

2446
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:08,639
use pure blend pure blend Pro hard to go

2447
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:12,760
bad with that dude that has great flavor

2448
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:15,000
in it I grow in dirt he grows in dirt

2449
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:16,960
this old man I grow in dirt reality

2450
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:20,399
reality of growing the dirt is like I'm

2451
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:23,920
very small scale I grow for me my family

2452
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:26,439
and the reality is that yeah I can look

2453
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:29,118
at at the Gary Payton you know I can get

2454
01:49:26,439 --> 01:49:32,238
a clone from Steve of of Gary Payton I

2455
01:49:29,118 --> 01:49:35,598
can grow it he can grow it his is gonna

2456
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:37,759
yield you know twice three times as much

2457
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:40,000
as mine in some cases the way you know

2458
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:43,159
he grows and the way he pushes

2459
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,118
things but we both have different needs

2460
01:49:43,158 --> 01:49:47,679
sure so I go for you know I go for what

2461
01:49:46,118 --> 01:49:51,359
I'm going to

2462
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:53,399
consume you know what comfort me is part

2463
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:56,039
of getting my hands dirty I used to be

2464
01:49:53,399 --> 01:50:00,399
an archaeologist so oh wow I didn't know

2465
01:49:56,039 --> 01:50:04,000
that yeah so I like playing the dirt um

2466
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:07,238
a lot so it's it's always been you know

2467
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,800
it just was a natural easy way and again

2468
01:50:07,238 --> 01:50:12,718
before the internet you know when I

2469
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,440
picked up a few books it suggested that

2470
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:19,719
the easiest way to learn was growing in

2471
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:22,519
dirt I have and I I've you've been using

2472
01:50:19,719 --> 01:50:25,399
the same basic formula now for almost 20

2473
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:28,440
years nothing changes I love

2474
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:29,319
it I got a man providing me a great set

2475
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:33,039
of

2476
01:50:29,319 --> 01:50:35,439
clones so it's always great that's how

2477
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:37,158
it goes so is there anything else you

2478
