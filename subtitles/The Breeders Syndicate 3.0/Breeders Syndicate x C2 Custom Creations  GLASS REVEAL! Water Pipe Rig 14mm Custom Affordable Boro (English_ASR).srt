and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,599
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,379
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
we're the traditional Market

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,679
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,738
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,200
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,280

attachment the normal bowl is actually

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,200
my favorite Bowl it's uh slotted

35
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,019
has a built-in filter

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,060
super thick and solid like

37
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,478
I don't worry about breaking it you know

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,280

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,420

of the show so

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,118
in honor of that we're going to use

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,439
the old vertex I talk about it all the

49
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,078
time a lot of people don't know what I'm

50
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,000
referring to this is the heat wand for

51
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,179
the rip

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,259
my rip master

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,959
um

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,378
my old friend irie eyes told me about

55
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,539
this back in the day and the story goes

56
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,239
um we're going to the can Illuminati

57
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:21,359
party and he was I don't know if he is

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,159
flying out to the party from LA but

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,739
resin lung had to stop by his place and

60
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,500
pick up his special bong

61
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,300
for in this special wand that he used

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,180
and I was like oh my God what a what a

63
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,160
yuppie dude what are you doing and I had

64
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,379
this plan where I was gonna like pretend

65
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,419
to break his bong because he's so like

66
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,280
anal about it needed to ship it or like

67
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,958
have someone pick it up and then we get

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,939
to the party and someone had I think

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,719
Denali had outdoor Blue Bonnet in the

70
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,699
first year

71
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,098
and um

72
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:52,560
I got to try it with this and it

73
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:55,818
completely changed my whole point of

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,219
view on smoking vaping

75
00:02:55,818 --> 00:03:02,699
flavors how you can assess them all of

76
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:05,459
it changed instantly so when I'm I don't

77
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:07,199
use it daily but when I'm like really

78
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,878
really wanting to figure out like what

79
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,299
something really tastes like and a

80
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,699
really really assess the high

81
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,800
you can't go wrong with the rip wand

82
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,719
um they've been having trouble sourcing

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,060
some of the parts for this for a long

84
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,280
time I know there's people working on

85
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,620
other ones but this so far this is my

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,500
best and the favorite

87
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:33,420
here we go uh this is ba 10 from

88
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,919
big ear and I can't remember what ba

89
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,199
stands for though

90
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,919
anyway let's see Born Again born again

91
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,919

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,080
thank you

93
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,739
hmm

94
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,560
actually has a really good flavor I

95
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,079
thought it was going to be very super

96
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,098
silver hazy but actually

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,099
like minty Christmas

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,879
yeah that's really good

99
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,039
it smells a lot like super silver haze

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,360
like a normal super silver haze the the

101
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,280
normal expression that goes around and

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
cut form out here but

103
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,239
ma'am it has a different flavor that's

104
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,240
really really good and unique

105
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,160
best I can go is like minty Christmas

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,020
not chocolate but almost like a

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,580
peppermint but not peppermint I I don't

108
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:04,579
