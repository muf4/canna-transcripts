00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599
be joined by members of the can

I'm Matthew here with my co-host

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,959
thousandth who's been absent for a few

22
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:51,558
episodes while he takes care of stuff

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,719
thousand where have you been what's been

24
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:57,759
going on yo yeah I everyone it's nice to

be back it's been a while um I don't

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,920
know it's not been that long but it

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,840
feels really long in in the context of

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,478
our show

29
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,439
just because we're weekly if you're gone

30
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,478
for like a few weeks people are like oh

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,959
my God he's been gone for months is he

32
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,478
gone now but I think it's been maybe a

33
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,158
month maybe it's been a month yeah um

34
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:20,319
but yeah life was just getting pretty

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,920
crazy I have kind of two pretty major

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,879
projects outside of you know outside of

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,960
cannabis that um were just yeah totally

38
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,560
consuming me one most people don't know

39
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,319
you're a leading actor

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,159
um behind the

41
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,158
scenes I was on a huge

42
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,039
feature yeah yeah Swedish soap

43
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,000
opera can see it

44
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:49,239
now but thankfully one of those projects

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,640
is like winding up um so you know I

46
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,078
could just feel like the mental space

47
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,478
kind of coming back but yeah for a few

48
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,519
weeks there I just couldn't even think

49
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,920
about anything so definitely

50
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,718
appreciate um you know Matt taking over

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,159
for a bit I I saw that Dan obviously

52
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:04,679
came on for a stream as well which is

53
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,719
awesome oh

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,439
yeah how was that show do you remember

55
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,799
that that was was that that

56
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,239
was that was not last week's but the

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,719
week yeah two weeks ago yeah from when

58
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,840
we're recording this currently it was

59
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,560
two weeks ago yeah no it was great

60
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,439
anytime Dan comes on it's always really

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,640
easy he's a quick thinker and he's witty

62
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,639
so it's just very easy to fire back and

63
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,039
forth you know he is quick he is quick

64
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,238
um I think I got to see a bit of it and

65
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,799
um his kid's really funny as well like I

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,319
like it the kind of like the random

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,760
insights into Dan's like home home life

68
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,439
yeah I know that's great yeah the chaos

69
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,399
of home

70
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,959
life yeah and I think

71
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,480
otherwise what was the other thing I

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,439
wanted to mention oh yeah I did have

73
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:57,079
another within within my growing I did

74
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,280
have kind of a big fail um I was meant I

75
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,040
was wanting to do a little pollen truck

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,479
and yeah tell us about just for yeah

77
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,039
yeah just just for my own personal

78
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,719
project not not a commercial thing at

79
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,400
all it was BL it was going to be a blind

80
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:14,080
selection everything but um as Matt

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,599
knows I wanted to do uh blueberry in

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,920
Cross

83
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,959
um and an appy cross well yeah blueberry

84
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:25,238
and cross and appy um and I just I think

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,959
partly because life was so crazy already

86
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,920
then I was struggling just to like there

87
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,920
were multiple points in which I think

88
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,798
[ __ ] up so as Matt knows I had some

89
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,958
germination difficulties with the

90
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,480
blueberry Andross totally my fault I I

91
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,878
think I just like didn't really think

92
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,798
about the fact that they were like you

93
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,438
know obviously it's quite an inbred line

94
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,840
and so I didn't really take the care

95
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,239
that you know that should have

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,560
warranted um yeah I bust balls about

97
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,480
germinations and how it should be done I

98
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,519
just had another message uh with

99
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,280
something similar where you know I like

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
I always say wait until you get your

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
first true leaves like barely starting

102
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,359
before you take them out of the sterile

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,680
environment before you put them in a

104
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,200
medium like to me that's super important

105
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,760
because they can get water through the

106
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,798
top as opposed to just trying to get all

107
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,518
through the tap rout when bacteria is

108
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,160
invading the tap rout and stuff and

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,120
someone just had like six seeds like all

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,280
start and stop and you know I mean like

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,639
it's just a a common thing to

112
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,559
hear I think it's one of those things

113
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,840
where if you are just used to Growing uh

114
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,839
really new you know relatively hybrid

115
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,239
stock then it's easy to become

116
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,000
complacent because you're like oh well

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,199
it's worked for me like just about every

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,959
time I'll just keep doing it the same

119
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,319
way even though I kind of knew of course

120
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,399
especially because I'm on the show with

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,279
you yeah that like my Approach which was

122
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:50,239
you know just like soak and then sew

123
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:52,279
yeah um is obviously not the most uh how

124
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,519
do I put it if you're playing a

125
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,679
probability game that's not what you

126
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,000
would do um exactly if you're trying to

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
maximize your like success that's not

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,839
the approach this is just like the most

129
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,599
convenient approach for a lot especially

130
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,599
as it relates to money too like people

131
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,960
buying seeds you know they're they're

132
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,360
they can be quite expensive so like when

133
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,719
you lose one out of a population of 10

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,879
that's a tenth of the money you've

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,840
invested gone now and then two and then

136
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,240
three and it you know yeah yeah so it

137
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,198
was my first big lesson I think for that

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
and um it was kind of fun still at the

139
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,400
same time like it's not it wasn't all

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
just bad like I remember messaging you

141
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,239
about it and then even getting to try I

142
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,079
think there was one that like it was

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,759
quite strange it like popped

144
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:36,680
it like had it had cottis but like its

145
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,199
tap wasn't developing and that was quite

146
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,439
interesting to look at um for a while um

147
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,759
and I guess I just like you know learned

148
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,038
about different things I talked to Dan

149
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,120
about it and he was like oh yeah you

150
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,159
could try like I think both of you were

151
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,439
like yeah you could try some rooting

152
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,880
hormone on the little yeah route to see

153
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,519
if it does anything and yeah so I

154
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,038
learned I learned quite a bit and it was

155
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,038
it was definitely like an interesting

156
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,038
like you were so hard on yourself bro

157
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:03,439
you were so hard on yourself dude I hate

158
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,478
it man like it I I know it's a part of

159
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,800
it but like yeah I don't like failing

160
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,279
like that yeah know I I I understand

161
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,720
like I I don't like failing at all and I

162
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,758
do it quite often I think it was also

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,840
just that added context of the like I

164
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,560
should have known a bit bit than that as

165
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,638
well I think that hurt more than just

166
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,959
the failure was like yeah yeah I think

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
we had just done the germination episode

168
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,799
right before that too that was the best

169
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,879
part yeah so that was stage one failure

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,280
and and in the end I still got like I

171
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,159
got one special girl out of that so I

172
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,758
was at least like thinking okay I

173
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,199
salvaged it just I have something

174
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,389
something um but that wasn't the end of

175
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,639
my fuckups

176
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:47,439
[Music]

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:51,038
um I so I had like five or six appies up

178
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,160
uh in addition to the BB incross yeah

179
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,079
and then what happened was that I found

180
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,800
a few males what I thought were males I

181
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,519
had one that was like definitely a male

182
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,199
and then I was like oh I've got this

183
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,120
other one that I think's a male and it

184
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,960
seems to like you know again quite

185
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,319
fairly arbitrary selection during V was

186
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,878
like oh yeah it seems to smell better it

187
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,240
seems to be like has nice branching

188
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,639
structure I'll just go for this one and

189
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,960
I threw the rest away and of course of

190
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,759
course when it flowered it was not at

191
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,680
all a

192
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:25,240
male no so no so I had no backups either

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,120
right so not a huge lesson like uh don't

194
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,720
just assume that your you know your your

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,598
pre- flower identification is always

196
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,560
right like at keep it back up yeah CU at

197
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,598
that point I remember looking in looking

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,879
in the grow space and being like oh my

199
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,519
[ __ ] god like this whole project is

200
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,280
[ __ ] now because of

201
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,318
me yeah like um prejudging like by

202
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,719
branching and stuff can be real tricky

203
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,960
especially with some lines that stretch

204
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,759
real heavy they can look real male and

205
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,758
yeah it's not it no I mean I was looking

206
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,639
at the pre-fl flowers obviously as well

207
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,439
it would just I thought I was I was kind

208
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,439
of like judging across the different

209
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,839
males that I had I guess or something

210
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,319
basically in my mind I had like three

211
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,000
males and I was trying to make a call

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,560
but they were obviously not all male

213
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,800
yeah so yeah you know obviously many

214
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,319
obvious lessons there like taken more

215
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,680
time to have committed to one could have

216
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,639
kept backups of the others like but with

217
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,079
small space it's hard to do so yeah yeah

218
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,840
yeah I think definitely the context

219
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,719
being quite stressed about it as well I

220
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,799
was kind of like hurrying to make a call

221
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
so that I could free up space and free

222
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,079
up my own time being like okay cool I

223
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,200
can get rid of all these plants now

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,879
great yeah um but yeah you know overall

225
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,000
still really funny and like of course I

226
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,519
still get to grow a bunch of great

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,720
plants still get to you know flower out

228
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,519
the appies get to flow out the

229
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,839
bbx um and the bbx I've kept as well

230
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,679
I've got cuttings so we'll get to go

231
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,720
again um and uh I didn't keep the appies

232
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,000
unfortunately but I'm going to be I'm

233
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,759
running already vegging the

234

okay though like I got plenty of other

244
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,278
blue stuff that I want to look through

245
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,560
like the blue resin you know Blue Sour

246
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,720
the the the blue Bubba stuff as well you

247
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,719
gave me a couple of different versions

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
of that there's some really nice berries

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,079
coming out of the blue Bubbas both of

250
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,799
them the PE Berry and the blush um yeah

251
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,319
yeah yeah it's a great selection that

252
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:45,719
may be my next that might be what I do

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,839
next yeah um but yeah otherwise this

254
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,720
current or this upcoming um truck is

255
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:57,279
hopefully going to be that BB and cross

256
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,160
girl and uh an eie appy mail and that

257
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,759
will be fun are you sure you don't want

258
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,559
to just jump into reversals before you

259
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:07,480
even do

260
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:10,039
that oh man no I a little more no no no

261
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,039
no no no I don't to add any more comp

262
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,278
any more complexity to this I just want

263
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,679
to make some

264
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,278
sceds um and just like yeah like I said

265
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,799
to you I think privately like just

266
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,519
really want to see what the process is

267
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:25,000
actually like and go through it

268
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,200
um and yeah I think it's just one of

269
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,159
those things I think that you naturally

270
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
want to learn as a grower after a while

271
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,600
right like it just makes sense yeah I

272
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,480
mean there's nothing more um I don't

273
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,959
know satisfying to me than like having

274
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,839
fully formed seeds and buds as you pull

275
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,518
them out looking at the maturity seeing

276
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,560
they're all mature and yeah I I love

277
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,078
that whole part of it watching New Birth

278
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,039
happen it's weird it's weird how

279
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,599
maternal instincts kick in when it comes

280
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,360
to seed braing over time so even

281
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,360
especially on your first time too though

282
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,879
like that's yeah yeah it's it's it's a

283
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,839
good feeling

284
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,480
yeah and I mean maybe this kind of ties

285
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,120
into what we'll talk about a bit later

286
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,320
on kind of reflecting on some of these

287
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,240
uh conversations that you and I have had

288
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,800
with the especially the older Forum guys

289
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,200
like I think one thing it reminds me of

290
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:18,078
you know when I hear them talk

291
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,879
is it's nice to remember that kind of

292
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,879
feeling that magical feeling when you

293
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,919
first started um when you new and and

294
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,919
how amazing it all was and it's not that

295
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,240
like we lose that completely but it's

296
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,599
easy to like forget maybe sure yeah

297
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
and I think you know obviously pushing

298
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,000
yourself to doing new new things is one

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,720
way to kind of um get that feeling back

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,919
like you know for me like trying to make

301
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,519
seeds is is is going to be somewhat

302
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,519
equivalent to me growing my first plants

303
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,360
it's a new completely new experience

304
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,519
cannabis burnouts a real thing like

305
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,800
especially over you know decades time it

306
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,720
can be very very serious and you can get

307
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,278
burned out pretty hard so it is always

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,440
good to keep it changing and keep you

309
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:01,519
know experiencing new things in it

310
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
yeah definitely definitely I I won't you

311
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,440
know I wanton name names but you know

312
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,480
the I like there's a there's a there's a

313
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,600
friend mutual friend that we have who

314
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,879
like yeah just just had a hard time and

315
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,879
it's like you can see like how much work

316
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,958
it is obviously obviously like to

317
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,360
maintain you know that many mothers or

318
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,958
you know to try and do all these

319
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,800
different projects

320
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,198
and yeah yeah so hats off to all of you

321
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,359
who've been doing this for you know you

322
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:30,240
said decades that's not me obviously

323
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,480
some of you have and that is

324
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,360
that is the next level to me yeah that's

325
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,759
hard especially keeping moms and [ __ ]

326
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,639
too once you get into that it's like now

327
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:43,198
you're in it for the long haul you know

328
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,919
yeah yeah yeah no no vacations no

329
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:46,838
breaks that was the other thing I was

330
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,879
goingon to mention there was a couple of

331
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,560
months ago like it was actually possible

332
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:54,480
that we were thinking of doing a small

333
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,039
overseas trip this year yeah um for

334
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,079
unrelated reasons that's not happening

335
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:02,278
but like even trying to think in my mind

336
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:04,000
like how to prepare for that um you know

337
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,679
like if I you know what I would try to

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,919
save and how I would try to save it like

339
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,559
would I have to pass them to someone

340
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,319
else to take care of would someone have

341
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,679
to come to the house and you know yeah

342
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,000
obviously these are known problems that

343
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:16,719
we all have I remember one time I tried

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,440
to do it using something called blue

345
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,399
mats um yeah yeah that's so for people

346
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,399
that don't know they little ceramic like

347
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,240
things that have a hole on top with a

348
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:33,278
plug connected to a u a piece of I don't

349
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,079
know tubing and you you set it in the

350
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,799
like a bucket of nutrient solution you

351
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,399
set the the dripper end into the plant

352
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,359
and over time it's supposed to Wick it

353
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,639
up in there but the problem is like

354
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,039
unless they're weighted heavily they'll

355
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,159
just sit at the top and barely get any

356
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,679
water into it and I found that out the

357
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,039
hard way one time you know like it's

358
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,599
it's so complex I was like oh yeah I'll

359
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:57,679
just run blue mats no big deal I've seen

360
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,040
other people do that [ __ ] so yeah no

361
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,000
it's it can be hard compx

362
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,198
I've looked at that too obviously as

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,958
many of us have and I think the thing

364
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:07,359
that freaks me out is how long it would

365
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,518
take kind of what you're saying really

366
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,120
just yeah how long it would take to test

367
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,879
and calibrate um you need weight

368
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,240
on yeah and you need to actually like

369
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,720
figure it out over quite a long period

370
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,399
of time and then and then know that it

371
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,600
will work otherwise don't rush into it

372
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,839
last second and just wing it in hope I'm

373
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,800
telling you yeah that sucks yeah you at

374
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,160
next we I don't know why they're not

375
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:34,958
like sold weighted because they just Bob

376
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,600
on top and barely get any water in it

377
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,119
but you need it like almost completely

378
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,320
immersed to get water in it so if it's

379
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,959
not weighted heavily enough then it

380
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,199
won't go into the water it it just

381
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,000
doesn't make any their design doesn't

382
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,879
make any sense to me so you mean this is

383
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,799
the like Reservoir side is that right

384
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:55,000
yeah yeah yeah it doesn't make any sense

385
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,278
to me at all I'm sure some experienced

386
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,559
blat people can can comment yeah chime

387
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,480
in leave a comment below and tell me how

388
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:04,359
I screwed up yeah yeah tell tell those

389
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,278
of us who are like maybe vaguely

390
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,039
interested as a contingency if we you

391
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,720
know how how you would approach using

392
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,319
something like

393
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,879
that yeah

394
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,759
um anything else well you know speaking

395
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,958
of burnout it was good you know part of

396
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,839
the break was actually being able to get

397
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,119
out of the city just for a few days so I

398
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,880
left the plants here and they were fine

399
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,879
for a few days um thank God for Pete for

400
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:31,240
me just that's why I don't do Coco um

401
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,278
and it was nice just to be aware for a

402
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,720
few days and just like have a change of

403
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,399
scenery I think in fact when when you

404
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,399
and Dan were doing the live I was on the

405
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,679
road and Dan was messaging me being like

406
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,318
where's Matt he's late like should I oh

407
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,758
yeah that's right that's right I think I

408
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:49,039
woke up like last minute or

409
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,278
something yeah I think you guys started

410
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,000
no it wasn't too bad I think you guys

411
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,600
started maybe like 10 15 minutes off the

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,318
mark but it was fine yeah yeah that's

413
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,079
funny as well yeah nice to be on the

414
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,120
road

415
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,439
the last time you were on the road Matt

416
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,799
uh last time I was on the road was just

417
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,399
for that last trip rose all

418
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,958
sick

419
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,519
oh yeah oh I I mean technically the like

420
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,919
a few weeks ago when I went out and djed

421
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,240
and uh out in the mountains ah yeah yeah

422
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,519
yeah got it yeah yeah I was so [ __ ]

423
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,360
hung over I was wild I don't drink

424
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,240
anymore ever like ever not a beer here

425
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,560
there so yeah yeah someone busted out

426
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,039

out there of me like snoring in my car

429
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,959
like that sounds like it would be nice

430
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,759
for like a couple of shots of when you

431
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,479
get kind of sick of that or does it like

432
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,039
is it okay to keep drinking I mean it

433
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,399
was delicious to me it was so it was

434
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,439
sweet and delicious I never had it

435
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,519
before this dude uh Steve he had like a

436
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,920
a parka and like it was a scooter rally

437
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,120
out in the mountains for like Vespas and

438
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,879
Lamas and old mod culture and um so he's

439
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,120
wearing his parka and he opened it up

440
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,679
and he had like all these little like

441
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,798
airport whiskey bottles of all these

442
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,079
different types he's like B so he's like

443
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,359
here try this peanut butter whiskey I

444
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,720
took a sip I was like that's delicious

445
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,000
clunk clun clunk clun clunk and I had

446
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,640
already drank some beer earlier so that

447
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,078
was just end the end of me pretty much

448
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,520
but I was the last one standing trying

449
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,918
to get everyone to still drink with

450
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,599
me yeah there's no way I could like I I

451
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
I haven't I haven't really had a drink

452
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,798
in a long time and I think if I were to

453
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,918
have like a night I would be [ __ ] for

454
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,720
ages like yeah it took me I think I

455
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,720
slept for like two days after that I was

456
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,038
just so hung over so hung

457
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,200
over not a

458
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,319
fan hey at least it was a change of

459
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,279
scenery I guess and sure it was nice to

460
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,439
see those people as well for you yeah

461
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,079
and I had a DJ Gig the next week um

462
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,440
going underground records here opened up

463
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,678
their new location and one of my best

464
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,440
friends that I used to be in a band with

465
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:01,480
owns it so we did a DJ Gig there the

466
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,759
next following week but that was in town

467
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,679
it was fun though it was nice seeing

468
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:08,240
everybody like all the old homies show

469
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,240
up while we're just playing

470
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,720
music yeah that sounds

471
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,038
nice yeah I mean I I don't really like

472
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,079
DJing too much um especially don't like

473
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,079
being called the DJ because it has all

474
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,639
that connotation with it I just like

475
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,599
playing music forcing people to listen

476
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,440
to the music that I like is is my

477
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,719
pleasure you

478
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,840
know yeah yeah and it's a great service

479
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,759
for those people yeah yeah I bet yeah or

480
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,759
some punk rock down the

481
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,600
throat yeah I mean I think for me that

482
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,279
was I think that that that's like the

483
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,599
summary of my time away ultimately and

484
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,279
um I think I think today's episode will

485
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,079
be a bit more of a rambly one we we're

486
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:51,639
going to take it easy we've got a few

487
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:54,000
different like mini topics to to discuss

488
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,120
um and so I think yeah we're going to

489
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,240
talk about uh well Matt mostly is going

490
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:02,798
to talk about the the uh upcoming

491
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,558
rescheduling of cannabis uh and then

492
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,200
we'll maybe reflect a bit on like the

493
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,599
Forum episodes the some of the

494
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
releases uh whether you know Matt and I

495
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,798
have are excited about any any shows

496
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,079
coming up um and then we also have a bit

497
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,679
of a like Community question that we can

498
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:21,240
dig into for to to kind of wrap it up um

499
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,559
but yeah just a chill one

500
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,120
today all right yeah Matt do you want to

501
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:28,798
tell us about the whole resiling thing

502
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,319
yeah I mean like first off it it took me

503
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:34,319
a while to look into because my

504
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:36,319
immediate reaction when I hear about a

505
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,319
law being passed that isn't voted on I'm

506
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,439
like okay who lobbied for it what money

507
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,678
went into it and if we're not voting on

508
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,240
it they don't do anything to give us

509
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,960
more

510
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,159
like rights on their own just for the

511
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,679
good of their just out of the goodness

512
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,280
of their heart that doesn't happen with

513
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,798
our government or or in politics ever

514
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,918
like I know you didn't vote on it you

515
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,079
know but let's uh let's I was he

516
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,759
schedule this you know like there's

517
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,000
always a reason behind it they always

518
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,519
have agendas it's politics it's how it

519
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,558
works for me so I didn't really look

520
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,798
into it much um but I did you know

521
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,119
enough people were asking about I was

522
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,119
like well I guess I should kind of look

523
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,798
into this you know instead of just being

524
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,158
skeptical um so it looks like it's going

525
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,359
to pass I don't remember how long it's

526
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,679
going to take to pass but it's not

527
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,158
necessarily passed yet um there there's

528
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,360
like a 30 to 60 day window for people to

529
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,880
like write in and like the DEA to

530
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,079
comment on it and all kinds of other

531
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:36,039
weird [ __ ] that goes on

532
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:38,918
um let's see you know you have different

533
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:41,240
Republican Senators chiming in on it

534
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,960
Democrats and the one thing I I saw

535
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:47,240
about an hour ago they they uh tweeted

536
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,440
out that the DEA didn't sign off on it

537
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,880
which was interesting and they don't

538
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,080
know quite the implications of the DEA

539
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
not signing off on

540
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:58,038
it so that's kind of an unknown right

541
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,200
now was there something about the

542
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,960
director cheing being there or something

543
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,798
I saw a headline maybe yeah I don't in

544
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,480
the thing it said they don't know if it

545
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,839
was like

546
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:15,278
a a stance of them not showing up to not

547
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:17,240
sign off on it as like a [ __ ] you um or

548
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:19,880
if it was just like a matter of someone

549
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,679
not being there but it wasn't signed off

550
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,520
on by the DEA which leaves room for a

551
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,360
lot of push back from the DEA if they

552
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:30,038
want to and they can always be an issue

553
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,479
always as they've always been because

554
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:35,879
that's what keeps them alive is drug

555
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,798
drug war money you

556
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,600
know um yeah I mean okay if it were to

557
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,319
if it were to go through um so assuming

558
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,038
it does go through like what do you see

559
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:49,960
it's impact being maybe safe for like

560
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,879
maybe we start with like um people like

561
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,278
you man like how how might it impact

562
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,080
Someone Like You who's like you know it

563
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:58,000
wouldn't selling seed stuff it wouldn't

564
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,439
like from my level of seed sales it

565
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,400
wouldn't affect at all like it's not

566
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:07,200
changing plant counts it's not changing

567
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,759
um uh the ability to accept credit cards

568
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
it's not changing anything like that um

569
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,359
there is some kind of banking build

570
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,839
that's slightly altered by it but like

571
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,798
this all goes back to licenses licensing

572
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,798
the banking thing yeah yeah the the

573
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:22,960
banking thing is a huge part of why the

574
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:24,918
Cannabis industry is having issues um

575
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,120
there there is some IRS statute it

576
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,440
changes a little bit and I think it only

577
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:35,119
changes it to the point of where you can

578
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,679
like report like lights as taxable stuff

579
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,479
you know like if you buy lights you can

580
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,360
report that as a write off um and I

581
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,880
guess that wasn't a thing before I

582
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,639
didn't know that but I mean I don't ever

583
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,278
you know write weed stuff off because it

584
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,320
just seems like playing fire you know

585
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:54,679
what I mean um but it's been interesting

586
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,439
to hear like the different political

587
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:01,159
Avenues since you know we're a a a

588
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Democrat and Republican only country

589
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,600
um there was a quote from a Republican

590
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,880
senator here that said marijuana is a

591
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,079
gateway drug and Democrats move to

592
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,240
legalize reflects pro-criminal

593
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,639
anti-American policies that will

594
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,759
stimulate more crime on American streets

595
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,038
he also argued that cannabis banking

596
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,038
legislation facilitates an entire

597
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,720
infrastructure and an ecosystem for more

598
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,278
drug usage In America which um very very

599
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,600
1970s

600
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:31,599
1960s type rhetoric I'd say yeah um but

601
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,558
that's to be expected I don't I don't

602
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,240
quite understand um the Republican

603
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:38,759
Democrat divide on this because they're

604
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,400
both so money hungry for taxes whe even

605
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,839
though Republicans say they're not like

606
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,519
they're as money hungry as the

607
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:48,278
Democratic side is for taxes could be

608
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:50,319
thing for their voter base you to like

609
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:53,240
play to what they perceive their voting

610
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,359
base you know their values to be in like

611
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,319
I don't know trying to make a bit more

612
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:57,639
of a show of it but ultimately maybe

613
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,439
still being like no it's going to be

614
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,240
great for for the taxes or like our I

615
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,120
don't know yeah and the one thing I also

616
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,400
read was that they wouldn't be able to

617
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,558
it would take like light speed

618
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,519
unprecedented um quickness for them to

619
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:14,000
pass this before the next presidential

620
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,119
election which depending on who's

621
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,119
President next if it's completely

622
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,759
different

623
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,439
Administration that could come backfire

624
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,079
and refold everything and make this a

625
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,278
totally nonissue you know what I mean um

626
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,359
but at the same time like I don't want

627
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,759
to sound like I'm saying you know

628
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,879
Democrats are doing something

629
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,798
Progressive for the Cannabis industry I

630
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,399
don't believe that for one second like I

631
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,720
think that they're doing it for

632
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:38,558
themselves like for their own

633
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,038
Investments for their you know their

634
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,480
sons and daughters who have these

635
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:43,879
cannabis companies that they're

636
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,079
investing in like that's what I think

637
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,440
this is all about big money that's

638
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,678
investing it's not to benefit um any

639
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,519
smalltime grower it's not to benefit the

640
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,440
people who have been pushing for

641
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,918
decriminalization or rescheduling all

642
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,840
these years there's nothing that's going

643
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,720
to benefit us like that that's not how

644
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,398
this works um maybe asking an obvious

645
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,240
question but would it benefit like Big

646
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:09,678
Industry players yes yeah I think so in

647
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,319
the end but they it wouldn't be like um

648
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,399
like a collective owner it wouldn't

649
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:17,558
benefit someone like that it would be

650
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:19,839
Big Industry like uh like one of the top

651
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,759
six marijuana companies on Earth you

652
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,798
know something like that that control a

653
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,919
large share of the the money coming in

654
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,240
um I'm sure those companies I'm sure the

655
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,200
stock prices of just sky Rock since

656
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,640
those announ very possible very possible

657
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,919
um here's a good quote too um let me see

658
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,278
I'm trying to see who is by sander zag

659
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,240
zagzebski co-chair of Clark Hills

660
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:44,119
cannabis practice whatever that is

661
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,839
schedule three doesn't legalize weed in

662
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,558
fact it just means it has a medical

663
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,798
benefit and you can buy it with a

664
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:54,440
prescription uh said whoever sandersi of

665
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,839
cherry of Clark Hill's cannabis practice

666
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,558
but none of the providers of cannabis

667
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,839
are licensed pharmaceutical companies

668
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,359
they're not FD regulated and of course

669
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,480
none of the recreational folks are

670
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,398
getting a prescription of any type so

671
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,839
cannabis is not going to be complying

672
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:11,519
with that regime um yeah the immediate

673
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,839
impact of uh rescheduling will be that

674
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:17,440
the IRS code section 280e will no longer

675
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,158
apply to plant touching state legal

676
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,919
cannabis companies and they will be able

677
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:22,720
to take normal business tax deductions

678
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,360
afforded to other Industries so that's

679
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,600
like the main thing is

680
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,000
that it's write-offs tax write-offs and

681
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,158
that's what tells me it only affects

682
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,319
like the major corporations that are

683
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,159
interested in that and that's probably

684
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:40,879
who lobbied for this what about like uh

685
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:44,278
individual consumers in terms of like

686
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,760
uh I don't know criminality and and what

687
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,200
people could be charged with how does

688
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,440
that so so far they're not even like

689
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,038
looking into as far as I'm aware like I

690
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,880
was researching this like making it

691
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,278
reverse charges of people already in

692
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,520
jail it's not really affecting that and

693
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:03,000
that's disgusting to me um it's and

694
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,798
again someone this is another quote this

695
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,679
is simply ending the federal prohibition

696
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,558
on cannabis for all purposes it will

697
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,159
still be up to states to decide what

698
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,599
legal what's legal within their

699
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,000
boundaries so it's still up to states to

700
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:18,079
decide and if your States like a more

701
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,119
anti-cannabis State it's not really

702
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,639
gonna like mess with that all that yeah

703
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,119
okay wait so can we come back to the

704
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,480
banking thing can you tell me a bit more

705
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,319
about the banking thing cuz that's like

706
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,000
a separate but related that's it own act

707
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:34,158
right that yes act and so how does it

708
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,359
how would it be affected by this

709
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,559
rescheduling or how how are they like

710
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,398
it's not it's not it's supposed to be

711
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,398
like Optics and say like oh this is a

712
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,359
good look for future like that they

713
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,518
might change that future you know what I

714
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,639
mean but because of this it might leave

715
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,679
them to change that okay even with that

716
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,320
like you have to have the correct

717
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,720
licenses and everything to even have

718
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,038
that apply to you like you know you have

719
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,679
to be one of the bigger companies that

720
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:00,839
pays these big big bucks to be able to

721
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,038
play with banking systems when this does

722
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:07,319
happen in the future um yeah it just

723
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:09,359
sounds like a bunch of Chad [ __ ] from

724
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,798
what I'm from what I'm hearing from you

725
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,119
it seems like for most of us and most of

726
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:14,440
the people who watch this show it's

727
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,678
probably not going to change our lives

728
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,798
or you know sorry the the Americans who

729
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,440
watch the show it's not going to change

730
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:24,079
their lives too much no and to me it

731
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,720
does similar stuff to like prop 64 was

732
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,720
telling everyone that it made cannabis

733
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,880
legal in California and people just like

734
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,319
oh cannabis is legal in California look

735
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,519
at the US it's so Advanced with its

736
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,839
marijuana laws and like while everybody

737
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,759
else is like going out of business

738
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:41,398
because we can't compete with big

739
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,759
corporate cannabis like it seems to me

740
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,599
to be one of those things where it's

741
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:47,359
like they go we rescheduled you know

742
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,319
we're so Progressive blah blah blah and

743
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:53,000
it's just nothing it means nothing yeah

744
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,278
it's cynical yeah yeah and and I'm

745
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,079
always like very very biased on those

746
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:01,200
takes but just even looking at what like

747
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,960
non-biased takes are on it they all are

748
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,919
saying the same thing I'm getting from

749
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,399
it you know like it's not going to

750
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,519
change anything U unless you're a major

751
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:10,918
player and and it's not even going to

752
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,038
necessarily go in before the next

753
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,919
presidential election which could mean

754
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,919
that it's a non it might be a non-issue

755
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,360
that it'll get flipped off the second

756
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,080
you know another Administration goes in

757
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,798
if they do which I don't even know what

758
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,079
to say about any of that but yeah I

759
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,319
think it was interesting to me because

760
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:33,038
it um the announcements came around the

761
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:35,839
same time that uh Germany legalized yes

762
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,240
um and obviously that they're not the

763
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,480
same at all or like you know there's a

764
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,399
huge contrast between the two I think

765
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,038
Germany's one is

766
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,839
like yeah it's not full

767
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:46,759
decriminalization either it's like

768
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,398
legalization in the sense that like uh

769
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,640
you know as an adult you can carry up to

770
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:53,199
x amount right and you have X amount of

771
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,960
plants like two or three or something

772
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,519
weird yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's

773
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,640
it's wild to see people's reactions to

774
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,558
stuff like that in Europe like um you

775
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,000
know like I I mess around in the UFO

776
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:08,158
World a little bit so I was I was in a

777
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,839
chat room over there uh for a YouTube

778
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,240
show and just a random guy in there was

779
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,199
talking yeah congratulations to us you

780
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,919
know cannabis just legalized in Germany

781
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,159
we can grow one plant or whatever it was

782
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,480
and I was just like oh man you don't

783
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,159
even realize though like you don't even

784
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,880
know how bad this is you're you're it's

785
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,159
just it's I don't know it's such a

786
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,519
Negative take on all of it but just I

787
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,559
just see the Fallout 10 years from now

788
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,000
that they're going to be like actual

789
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,519
cannabis producers not just consumers

790
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,679
because consumers don't seem to ever

791
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,359
recognize the part that like how it

792
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,120
affects the Growers and will affect what

793
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:48,519
they get to smoke on the back end of

794
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:50,079
it no well to be fair to most consumers

795
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,679
it's just like a black box right they

796
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,199
don't really know much about what's

797
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,919
actually as long as they can go byy and

798
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,200
smoke they're happy that like I said

799
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,278
yeah they the producer aspect of it they

800
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,240
don't get they're gonna end up with

801
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:05,798
Walmart weed

802
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,319
so try to explain that it's like just

803
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,519
okay I'm looking at the I'm looking at

804
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,038
the law it's if I'm not mistaken and

805
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,720
someone obviously free to correct me

806
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,798
anyone in the comments but uh for an

807
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,038
adult they can carry up to 25 grams

808
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,200
which is about an ounce um and you can

809
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:24,798
grow up to three plants three yeah

810
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,200
that's what it was yeah yeah so think

811
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,679
about how much great breeding you can

812
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,000
get done with three plants it's very

813
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:33,559
hard yeah very hard so how how are these

814
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
like all the best breeding that's been

815
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,918
done in our in the Cannabis scene in

816
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,919
America has been done clandestine it's

817
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,480
not been done by these Big Industry

818
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,759
people selecting out of a thousand

819
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,399
something plants it's been homeg Growers

820
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,319
you know um but three plants makes it

821
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,879
rough makes it really rough to hybridize

822
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:56,158
do any of that stuff

823
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,639
so man I it it is really complicated and

824
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,919
like I sometimes think if I being really

825
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:04,359
optimistic uh you could say that

826
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,440
superficially it's going in the right

827
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,879
direction and hopefully eventually that

828
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,840
will lead to something better than what

829
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,559
we

830
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:13,519
have um I think that's they rarely give

831
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,879
back rights yeah like to me it's just

832
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,960
like they they don't give back rights

833
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:22,919
just to do it ever that's not something

834
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,759
yeah yeah yeah politics yeah yeah yeah

835
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,080
and when you that's like why when I see

836
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:28,000
oh we're rescheduling even though you

837
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,839
didn't vote on it it wasn't like you

838
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,919
know a movement by the people that's

839
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,879
when I'm

840
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:37,440
like who lobbied who lobbied Lobby

841
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,799
[ __ ] I don't I'm I'm so anti lobbyist

842
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,600
it's the most disgusting part of our

843
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,558
political system well one of them other

844
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:47,319
than the fact there's only

845
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:49,240
two like two sides that can get into uh

846
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,079
any kind of office

847
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,038
really yeah yeah I mean this all just

848
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,638
reminds me as well that down here you

849
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:58,720
know in the uh Democratic uh nation of

850
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:00,879
Antarctica um

851
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,399
we had it's similar like in terms of its

852
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,720
classification it's a similar problem

853
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:09,319
like it's I think here it's called class

854
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,720
a um and it you know alongside like the

855
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,918
hardest stuff um so you know more or

856
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,200
less the same class you guys call it one

857
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,679
to three right yeah one to three so you

858
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,960
probably have a to c yeah a Toc same

859
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,919
thing we had a it was slightly different

860
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,159
in that we actually had a n a national

861
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,919
referendum uh a vote on whether to

862
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,919
legalize and it wasn't I don't think

863
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,960
there was ever the option to

864
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,240
decriminalize I think it was only like

865
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,558
legalization so similar to Germany like

866
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,038
you'd have limits um the vote failed on

867
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:44,319
like a knif edge knif sge it was like a

868
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:47,278
like maybe less than 1% yeah um that it

869
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,000
failed so you know people voted no and

870
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,880
it was just really infuriating because

871
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,638
the government at the

872
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,039
time still could have just passed it

873
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:56,678
like they or they could have done

874
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,398
something but they just you know they

875
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,038
just kind of used that to cover their

876
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,599
asses and they were just like yeah see

877
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,119
it's no so we're not we tried yeah yeah

878
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:06,678
we tried there you go and now it seems

879
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,039
likely that that kind of opportunity

880
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:09,760
won't come up again for another like

881
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:11,000
decade you know because there's nothing

882
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,280
in it for the

883
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,239
government yeah but at the same time I

884
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,720
just think like knowing that that's a

885
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,358
place I'd like to move because that's

886
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,559
where opportunity is found in the Bold

887
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,559
you know I see what you mean I see what

888
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,838
you

889
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,320
mean yeah I don't know it is complicated

890
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:30,199
because at the same time it's like I

891
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,000
also it's hard

892
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,319
to someone who's just a consumer and

893
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,280
feel them feeling safer is hard to you

894
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,879
know that's kind of irreducible that's

895
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,280
you know you can't say that's a bad

896
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,759
thing for people who just no I'm just

897
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,919
kidding just kidding people but it is it

898
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,879
is complex for us who are like yeah on

899
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:54,440
the other side of it yeah I just it to

900
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:56,639
me it's my my passion's breeding so it

901
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,800
stifles breeding it to me it totally

902
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,039
stifles it like if it's left up to

903
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,800
corporate a cannabis who know really not

904
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:08,440
[ __ ] about cannabis to then take the

905
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,839
genome further that like it just

906
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,358
completely stifles all like like I said

907
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:18,039
everything all the best genetics out

908
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:20,559
there have been made in Black Market OBS

909
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:23,000
um over the years and there's not been

910
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,480
since since the legal times there hasn't

911
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,358
been a lot of advancement in breeding in

912
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,880
fact that's when we got the cookies era

913
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:31,039
so it's just like this is what we get

914
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,320
you know so it's to me it's it's proof

915
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,599
and evidence of it stifling

916
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,440
breeding yeah yeah it Narrows things it

917
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,640
um yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean because at

918
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,800
the end you you're just subject to the

919
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,078
forces of capitalism right which are

920
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,800
ultimately like

921
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:53,200
exploitative and um just want to exploit

922
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,800
the you know whatever type um of product

923
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,039
that like seems to be the most

924
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,599
successful and that's all you're ever

925
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,279
going to get right

926
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,920
what I've been talking about like my

927
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,920
friends up there tell me is that the the

928
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,000
people who do the buying of seeds for

929
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,519
the government that are allowed to be

930
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,280
sold aren't even cannabis people so you

931
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,199
have people choosing what genetics go

932
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,440
forward forward that probably don't even

933
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,679
smoke or have any interest in why these

934
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,358
are the genetics are choosing to go

935
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,279
forward I don't even know how they

936
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:24,119
determine that like it's a crapshoot or

937
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,119
a monkey throwing [ __ ] you know like

938
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,519
yeah it just blows my mind how that

939
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,119
works

940
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,960
yeah

941
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,760
yeah

942
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,720
um yeah anything else on this I'll never

943
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,440
rely on politicians for my job or career

944
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,719
or my passion like I I've tried to make

945
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,000
this such a non-issue for how I exist

946
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,519
and live that I could give less of a

947
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,079
[ __ ] what's going on in the political

948
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,079
world it doesn't affect me and it never

949
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,720
will I don't

950
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,318
think pardon my

951
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:58,239
French n it makes sense I get it I get

952
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,400
it it's it's pretty

953
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,239
it's it's very

954
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,838
um it's very discouraging to witness

955
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:07,679
like the more you learn about um how

956
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,159
those games work and the lobbying and

957
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,440
everything it is extremely Bleak um even

958
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,199
for those of us who live outside of the

959
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,760
US like obviously everyone we know we

960
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,759
have to kind of like watch what's going

961
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,079
on for you guys because it it does have

962
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,040
like consequences for the rest of us

963
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,200
especially those countries yeah um so I

964
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,159
mean Germany as well right so those two

965
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,679
you know the US and Germany

966
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,960
making moves is something that we have

967
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:35,078
to pay attention to yeah

968
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,720
definitely but yeah yeah still still

969
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,280
pretty disappointing yeah um if you guys

970
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,239
have any other opinions please weigh in

971
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:47,160
in the comments it's obviously like

972
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:49,439
quite a you know quite a thorny issue so

973
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,318
and I like if I'm being a little bit

974
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,000
even more skeptical I'd wonder if they

975
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,639
brought up the scheduling [ __ ] during

976
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,079
this particular time in the world with

977
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,879
the chaos going on on like be like a

978
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,839
highlight to a distraction yeah because

979
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,838
like people were wondering why Democrats

980
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,719
and Republicans are aligning so hard on

981
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:09,679
a specific issue together when they

982
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,879
don't on anything and all of a sudden

983
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,199
it's like okay let's bring up AR reason

984
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,079
to fight again you

985
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,519
know yeah yeah don't think about the

986
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,039
wars think of any of that yeah

987
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,719
exactly

988
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,880
geez well okay well mat is there

989
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:27,799
anything else you want to say on this no

990
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,079
I just

991
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,839
just people do your research um even

992
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,920
though I didn't even do research much

993
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,880
until recently for this but um use

994
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,318
common sense if they're giving you

995
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,559
something you didn't ask for and it's

996
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:44,679
the people who take money from you and

997
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:46,279
taxes ask questions don't just assume

998
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,399
it's for the benefit of the people

999
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,760
because it's usually

1000
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,760
not that's my best

1001
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,760
advice maybe I don't know I feel like as

1002
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,960
you know citizens under such governments

1003
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,400
you just hope that the interest happen

1004
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,400
to align with yours that's that's

1005
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,039
literally it

1006
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,000
yeah vote at politics locally and hope

1007
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,559
to affect stuff in your state you know

1008
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,838
like there's that old quote all politics

1009
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:14,000
is local um that's a real thing you know

1010
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:17,199
but even then it's just who wants to get

1011
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,199
involved in [ __ ] politics anymore God

1012
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,559
I hate

1013
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,239
politicians oh man it's a freaky looking

1014
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:26,119
game from the

1015
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:29,000
outside cannabis is bad enough bro and

1016
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,559
political enough I don't want to get

1017
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,960
that yeah and which is

1018
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:37,239
worse I'm not sure euphology might be

1019
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,240
worse than all of

1020
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:44,879
them okay shall we move on to just our

1021
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,598
like a mid-season recap yeah let's do it

1022
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,200
so man and I talked a bit about this

1023
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,680
we're not like going to get into like

1024
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:52,279
very very specific uh Reflections or

1025
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,879
anything but I kind of I was my prompt

1026
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,440
for Matt was like we had a bit of a

1027
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
theme this season which was talking to

1028
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,400
people who were involved in the forums

1029
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,680
from quite early on um whether that's

1030
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,200
canak Cabana Crews there're two of them

1031
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,318
right de man's crew and then Kirby's

1032
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,480
crew and then well maybe not Cruz like

1033
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:13,119
those two generations generation and

1034
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,079
then we had subro on as well and so I

1035
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,400
think I think my PRT for Matt was like

1036
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,640
you know do you have any like very very

1037
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,960
broad uh like feelings Reflections after

1038
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,400
hearing some of that like didn't it make

1039
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,199
you think about your own time in that

1040
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,119
time on the forums uh you know whether

1041
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,000
it's like what they were growing what

1042
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,240
the culture was like for them versus for

1043
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,318
you um I don't know yeah STW I think

1044
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:46,199
yeah um so like uh start with the can

1045
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:48,800
cavana episodes um like uh Dem man

1046
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,559
skiddy hoe their generation was the

1047
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,240
generation before mine on the forums

1048
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,480
like before I started getting really

1049
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,639
involved so it was it was things like

1050
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,400
that for me are always a treat to hear

1051
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:04,039
when people that came before me were

1052
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,519
integrally involved in stuff that I was

1053
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,639
involved in later and hearing like

1054
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,358
different because not everything's

1055
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,799
literal or not everything's passed down

1056
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:13,719
correctly so you get to hear all these

1057
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,599
stories about how other things happened

1058
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,318
and I don't know like that those are

1059
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,000
some of my favorite shows to do is

1060
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:22,119
interviewing the people who came before

1061
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,838
me and were just as passionate about

1062
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,519
like seeds and genetics as I am that's

1063
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,159
the kind of stuff that really really

1064
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,079
really interests me

1065
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,239
um I think it also when I hear them and

1066
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,560
their stories it obviously makes me

1067
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,199
imagine what it would have been like to

1068
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,480
have been them where it was like an

1069
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:40,039
absolutely New Frontier of like

1070
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,440
communicating about this stuff and just

1071
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:47,000
like you know um Uncharted Territory

1072
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,838
right yeah and like the idea to pass

1073
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,480
Cuts around and hold them and get them

1074
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:53,279
out to people on forums and stuff like

1075
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,838
that wasn't being done before these guys

1076
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,240
so I mean there were small Pockets like

1077
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,000
the 77 crew and stuff like that but

1078
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,919
generally speaking that generation of

1079
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,358
guys um it really wasn't being done like

1080
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:09,599
that before so it really really built

1081
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:12,000
the whole industry as it was to carry on

1082
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,880
um yeah I will say one more thing is

1083
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,760
that like for me like one of the feeling

1084
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,280
I did feel some jealousy right in the

1085
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,880
sense that uh obviously not saying that

1086
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,960
there were no politics but the politics

1087
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,200
back then were very different and it it

1088
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,720
didn't it definitely seemed like not

1089
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,879
every action was so weighted was so you

1090
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,959
know I don't know how you would put it

1091
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,720
but um they definitely it felt like they

1092
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,400
were much Freer to do whatever right

1093
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,239
pass things around to whoever share um

1094
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,440
hold on people weren't as precious as

1095
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:46,879
they are or might be

1096
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:50,720
now um so yeah into the Kirby episodes

1097
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,358
um those those were my era like I was

1098
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,919
active during that time and and this

1099
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:56,679
goes on to the sub Rob era he was a

1100
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,639
little bit before me but then our times

1101
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,639
kind of Co onesided even down to me

1102
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:04,358
being in the San Diego's finest you know

1103
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:07,598
threads with him um the the one thing I

1104
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,880
noticed the most probably in the in the

1105
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,760
My Generation

1106
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,200
episodes my my experience from other

1107
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,839
people's experiences in the Forum is

1108
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:19,519
always so vastly different like I came

1109
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:22,400
in trying to be the figurative pipe bomb

1110
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,920
for the industry in my mind like seeing

1111
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,119
everything I don't like and seeing all

1112
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,559
the corruption and just wanting to like

1113
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,160
caused chaos and and started over you

1114
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,440
know like this needs to be broken and

1115
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:35,920
rebuilt there's so much corruption just

1116
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,679
inherently in here like a revolution of

1117
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,559
sorts like I'm an idiot so like I really

1118
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,239
thought I could do this [ __ ] you know um

1119
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,559
in doing that I was banned from every

1120
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:48,318
Forum that existed at some point other

1121
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,559
than my own you know like maybe yeah I

1122
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:52,239
don't think there was any that I didn't

1123
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,800
have some sort of temporary ban from so

1124
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,519
well while these guys were you know like

1125
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,000
had a lot of camaraderie and stuff on

1126
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,559
the forums I had some of that

1127
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,039
but not a ton like not a ton I was very

1128
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,359
much a rogue

1129
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,358
element so yeah it's it's interesting to

1130
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,920
hear other people that have had those

1131
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,639
experiences and like I had friends that

1132
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,159
were like really well-liked on the

1133
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:15,159
forums and stuff but it was always a

1134
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,920
joke because I was the most hated guy so

1135
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:19,279
like trying to

1136
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,358
um associate with that was always really

1137
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,559
hard you know there of course there's G

1138
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,639
to be some jealousy there like I would

1139
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,359
have lik to have had that camaraderie I

1140
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,879
just didn't necessarily feel that with

1141
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:31,480
everyone and if you and at that time if

1142
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,920
you spoke up against anyone that was a

1143
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,240
big name and and even asked hard

1144
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,519
questions uh even respectfully hard

1145
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,479
questions you were just met with

1146
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,358
derision and once you're banned from a

1147
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,400
place everybody's like why' you get

1148
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:45,960
banned must be a piece of [ __ ] and that

1149
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,559
just carries on each time you get banned

1150
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,679
more and more if everybody's banned this

1151
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,440
real bad you know what I mean so I guess

1152
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,480
that's one downside of that time which

1153
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,159
is that people were very like it was a

1154
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,679
lot more for like of bit a term like

1155
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:01,000
feudal like

1156
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:03,519
hierarchical yeah you know there these

1157
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,760
little like on not enclaves but little

1158
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:09,280
like tribes and um if you were out you

1159
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,640
were out right of those yeah and I've

1160
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,400
talked about it before on the forums

1161
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,358
during my era that like okay versus uh

1162
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,280
like the Dem man era there was one main

1163
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,838
Heaven Stairway seed bank where you got

1164
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,760
to go do this stuff and you know

1165
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:24,799
overgrow was attached to that that Forum

1166
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,079
but during my era every single form had

1167
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,920
a seed bank attached to it and and in in

1168
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,200
doing that if you spoke up against any

1169
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,000
of those breeders on there you're exnay

1170
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:36,279
and blacklisted from that forum and all

1171
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,679
you know like all the dick writers that

1172
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,000
go along with that on each level so yeah

1173
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,679
it's uh that that is a main difference I

1174
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,119
think between those two eras how hard it

1175
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,399
would be to assimilate it would have

1176
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:52,358
been much easier to assimilate during um

1177
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:57,519
the man's era say versus um what Kirby

1178
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:59,679
was talking about for sure or sub even

1179
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,440
okay well I mean on that note like did

1180
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,639
you have any thoughts about maybe more

1181
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,920
on the side of like genetics provenance

1182
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:09,960
like were there did you have thoughts on

1183
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,720
like you know how different was you know

1184
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,440
the stuff that each of these groups were

1185
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:19,318
growing um to what you were maybe or

1186
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,159
even just uh between themselves um were

1187
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,800
there any like new was there any new

1188
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:24,679
information that came to light in any of

1189
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,440
those conversations I'm sure there was

1190
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:27,879
new information um I'd have to go back

1191
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,838
and relist

1192
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,880
yeah but like like d man's crew era um

1193
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,880
lots of Brothers Grim we hear that

1194
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,680
non-stop from that era um the Dutch

1195
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,519
Flowers we talked about Dutch Flowers

1196
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:42,879
that's some new info that I that I could

1197
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:44,440
put out there um Dutch Flowers they

1198
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,838
weren't a Dutch they weren't a Dutch

1199
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,679
seed company but they were called Dutch

1200
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,519
Flowers and they were ran they were sold

1201
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:52,118
on Heaven Stairway and they were making

1202
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,920
like you know like they put them on

1203
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,640
auction on seedbay for like cbay for

1204
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,838
like you know a th000 which was

1205
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,719
ridiculous for back then like ridiculous

1206
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:05,119
but it would be you know bit up bit up

1207
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:07,199
bit up and um I've always had this

1208
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,838
theory that and and it was I think it

1209
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,399
started through reeferman which is like

1210
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:12,599
the worst Source on Earth for

1211
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,160
information but when I first spoke to

1212
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,960
him I asked him who ran Dutch Flowers

1213
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:18,239
because that's always fascinated me this

1214
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,960
this company that had like the first

1215
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,759
hype seeds and um he's like oh yeah that

1216
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,199
was Cal reian I was like are you sure

1217
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,240
he's like yeah well you know I worked

1218
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:27,439
with him a lot you know like I I know

1219
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,598
what he was doing

1220
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,838
and then my old buddy JoJo would make

1221
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,559
seeds and send him into Heaven Stairway

1222
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,880
and looking back I would see that they

1223
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,240
would come out and be released under

1224
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,640
Dutch Flowers that was also kind of

1225
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:41,799
interesting but I didn't know if like he

1226
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:44,400
was just sending in reproductions for

1227
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,440
free at that time or how it was working

1228
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,119
um but when I was talking to dman he

1229
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,280
came to the same conclusion separately

1230
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:53,400
on his own about Cal reian and that's

1231
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,599
not his real last name by the way so so

1232
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:02,280
you guys know um I'm not doxing him um

1233
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:05,519
it's or RC Richard calan

1234
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:09,119
um it always seemed to be like really

1235
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:11,519
really nice um copyrighting like the

1236
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,800
best for its time like this strain will

1237
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,719
be blah blah blah it came got its name

1238
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,640
because of blah blah blah it was always

1239
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,719
really well spelled out always sounded

1240
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:21,558
really good like the metal Haze because

1241
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:24,078
we grew with uh or could had this

1242
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,359
metallic taste you know like all these

1243
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,440
different facets chocolate trip so chocy

1244
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:33,000
with the chocolate thae and the Indigo

1245
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,838
diamond and you know um yeah it was

1246
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,679
always so appealing even even during my

1247
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:38,039
era go going back and reading that they

1248
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:40,759
always had the best copywriting and

1249
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,920
that's kind of what calan was known for

1250
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,880
um that's right I remember you

1251
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,280
mentioning specifically how good the

1252
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,960
marketing the writing was right it is

1253
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,400
phenomenal like legendary um I mean I

1254
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,679
probably use as try to incorporate

1255
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,440
aspects of that in my own just like in

1256
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:59,558
in trying to describe as best I can

1257
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,960
when I'm selling something my experience

1258
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:03,960
with it based on reading those and being

1259
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,159
like oh because they're saying this this

1260
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,960
and this I feel like I can get this this

1261
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,239
and this from it and that appeals to me

1262
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,480
but like I've tried to be more accurate

1263
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,558
about it because their [ __ ] was not

1264
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,599
accurate at all like go looking back

1265
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,240
after being able to grow a bunch of

1266
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,440
Dutch flower stuff like chocolate trip

1267
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,279
wasn't chocolatey it was more like c99

1268
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,639
you know like [ __ ] like that like

1269
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,880
yeah I don't know that's that's one of

1270
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:31,199
those parts of um history I'd like to

1271
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,599
really really pull the threat on is RC

1272
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:36,598
and his his business because Heaven

1273
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,359
Stairway was so legendary and um he's

1274
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,798
still out there you know like the guy's

1275
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:42,759
still out there I and I know where he

1276
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:45,519
works and it would be nice to interview

1277
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,119
him but like because he went through so

1278
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,199
such a big process with the courts and

1279
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,880
[ __ ] I don't know if that dude has PTSD

1280
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:55,000
from it all or he even wants to speak on

1281
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,920
anything it would be great if he did um

1282
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,119
if anybody knows him you know can always

1283
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,280
show them the show and tell them to

1284
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:03,318
reach out um yeah that's one of those

1285
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,480
white whes like figuring out the RC

1286
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:08,039
Story versus Dutch Flowers and overall

1287
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,318
the Heaven Stairway story I actually

1288
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:11,960
remember you talking about RC like quite

1289
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,279
a long time ago on this show before I

1290
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,119
started and stuff potentially like he's

1291
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,920
someone or maybe that was R oh R he's

1292
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,519
the other good really good writer yeah

1293
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,039
he's the other amazing amazing writer

1294
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:24,358
yeah from High Times back in the day

1295
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:27,279
again that dude so far is still alive

1296
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:29,759
he's really old but like I would killed

1297
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,640
to interview him and have gotten no

1298
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,799
response no interest no nothing like

1299
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,879
I've I've written him letters uh emails

1300
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:39,199
I've tweeted at him I see him respond to

1301
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,599
other people so he's looking at his

1302
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,879
tweet his Twitter but like yeah I can't

1303
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,318
get anything like that those two are

1304
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,079
some of the bigger white whales and of

1305
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:52,920
course the other R the other RC Rob

1306
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:55,160
Clark the other RC yes yes we um yeah we

1307
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,480
will say say less about that for now but

1308
00:50:55,159 --> 00:51:00,920
yeah for sure um the three white whales

1309
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,440
though you know sorry this is a t

1310
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,400
complete tangent I think we'll come back

1311
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,559
to the Forum stuff but just thinking

1312
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,079
about copyright um are we [ __ ] now

1313
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,440
with chat GPT like like all the white

1314
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:15,519
label companies just going to start

1315
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,760
using AI to write all their like you

1316
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,280
know really generic descriptions of

1317
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,680
stuff I also think like pictures for

1318
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,119
plants are soon to be [ __ ] like you

1319
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:26,719
can just have a a a picture you can't

1320
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,838
back research and see that someone's

1321
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,679
this picture from someone and you can

1322
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:32,679
have it completely made up by Ai and now

1323
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:34,199
you have this new strain even though the

1324
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:36,118
the the seeds may not look like that at

1325
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:39,159
all when you grow them out but like as a

1326
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,280
presentation to put a picture up there

1327
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:42,920
like yeah I think that's going we're

1328
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,519
[ __ ] with that too like it's going to

1329
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,358
be hard to tell who's lying who's not

1330
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:49,280
unless you're a good grower grow them

1331
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:50,880
out can you know have have data points

1332
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,000
to show oh this isn't even like that

1333
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,880
that guy's a [ __ ] dummy you know

1334
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,159
there GNA be a lot of that coming up o

1335
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:01,318
okay that this might be like a topic for

1336
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:03,239
another episode sure yeah what AI means

1337
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,358
for marketing in

1338
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:09,199
Canabis you know like I'd rather not

1339
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:11,279
have a picture than use a fake picture

1340
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,558
like that like that's just promises

1341
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,880
promises yeah um yeah I don't know

1342
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:19,200
that's actually misleading as opposed to

1343
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,200
like I don't know yeah

1344
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:25,399
exactly okay okay anyway sorry back to

1345
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,200
back to the Forum stuff for a bit um

1346
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,200
what about when what about talking to

1347
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,318
sub Rob because obviously that one you

1348
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:35,159
know that San Diego that's local to you

1349
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,838
how did you feel about those those talks

1350
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,078
I like subro and me have been friends

1351
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:42,639
for a long time I love that dude like me

1352
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:44,318
and him have talks about life and just

1353
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,679
everything in general we get along so

1354
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:47,400
well on every level politically

1355
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,159
everything like we just see the world in

1356
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,160
very similar ways um during the San

1357
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,000
Diego's finest area he was the only

1358
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:57,679
person that was nice to me in that

1359
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,119
[ __ ] thing um like no one liked me

1360
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,879
there not one like they just did not

1361
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:06,358
like me and I you know I'm kind of

1362
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:07,318
grading so I get that but um yeah so I I

1363
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:08,798
would have liked to have been more

1364
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:11,880
involved in that and I remember at the

1365
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:14,280
time feeling like like I should have

1366
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,318
been more involved in it but I felt like

1367
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,798
I wasn't allowed to be more involved in

1368
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:21,239
it if that makes sense one thing I did

1369
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:23,079
learn that I wasn't aware like because I

1370
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:25,159
was kind of friends with ape like during

1371
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:26,960
those years uh G as we referred to him

1372
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:29,239
ape and

1373
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,079
um buying tons of clones off him a lot

1374
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,358
of the Clones me and Rob were running

1375
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,160
during those years were the same exact

1376
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:36,960
clones and I didn't know that and I

1377
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,279
didn't know uh that that he was a major

1378
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,960
influence like one of the main

1379
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,319
influences on Sand die was finest

1380
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,440
popping up to showcase the Clones so

1381
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:47,119
that was fascinating shout out ape again

1382
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,480
he's the guy who who made sure I had

1383
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,920
cookies really early on and Cherry Pie

1384
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,719
and stuff um always been super super

1385
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,200
good to me like yeah I mean even in my

1386
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:59,039
like brief paray through that through

1387
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:01,719
those threads like you could tell he was

1388
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:05,318
like a hub right like yeah write that

1389
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:07,000
down by the way hit up ape might well

1390
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,318
have him on see if we can get him on

1391
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,440
yeah yeah yeah he's a great speaker too

1392
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:16,880
he really intelligent so yeah it'd be

1393
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:18,920
good good call um what about the plants

1394
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,200
that sub Rob talked about like most of

1395
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,880
them were they mostly familiar to you

1396
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,118
because they local

1397
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,838
or all of them all of them were familiar

1398
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:30,039
like that that's what was really cool

1399
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,960
about that was like when you have these

1400
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:34,679
strains from your local area that you're

1401
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,240
very familiar with or that are like

1402
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:38,798
legendary and you grow up thinking about

1403
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:41,439
those or you know what I mean like

1404
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:44,119
they're big in your life that builds

1405
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,079
camaraderie as well you know um the bull

1406
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,240
riter the one that like by the time I

1407
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,160
got down there it was gone it was just

1408
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,959
[ __ ] gone so it was like just this

1409
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,519
mystery you know like anything about it

1410
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,440
was a mystery but Afghani bull writer

1411
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:58,880
was down there you know um and and of

1412
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,960
course me and Rob like kind of had

1413
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,119
differing opinions on the uh the release

1414
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,318
of The Afghani bull riter but you know I

1415
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:09,039
had a lot more info on that uh the Back

1416
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:11,159
info on uh the particular person we were

1417
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,838
referring to so yeah that's always going

1418
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:14,679
to happen you know like especially in

1419
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:17,920
Cruz like he's going to like someone

1420
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:20,759
that I don't or be be L at least like

1421
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,440
not know as much about someone as I do

1422
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,760
or have as much to say about someone as

1423
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,720
I do different experiences that happens

1424
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,680
a lot um yeah yeah that that tends to

1425
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:31,038
happen when I talk to people that were

1426
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,318
around during a certain era I'm like

1427
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,400
[ __ ] that guy you know like what do you

1428
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:37,798
mean he's okay [ __ ] that guy that

1429
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,920
happens a lot so

1430
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:42,280
yeah one thing I didn't get the chance

1431
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,240
to ask him in that first episode

1432
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,880
was like what's happened to those that

1433
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:49,279
group of people now or whether he's

1434
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,559
still in touch with them or still does

1435
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,280
stuff with them or um like one of the

1436
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:54,599
main guys was a guy named gry skull I

1437
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,319
mean I'm still in touch with gry skull

1438
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,760
too but he's moved on I think from

1439
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,719
cannabis now finally

1440
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,799

1441
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:05,679
know I'll keep it vague on that but yeah

1442
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:07,079
he's a great dude though everybody all

1443
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:08,440
those guys still talk to each other I

1444
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:13,798

1453
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:37,960
those in those shows it was it was clear

1454
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:39,558
enough to some people who are newer like

1455
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,480
that some of these guys were actually

1456
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:44,760
directly involved in some of the

1457
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,599
biggest you know things that we have now

1458
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,640
like for example I know one thing we

1459
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:51,359
wanted to cover that we didn't get to

1460
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,519
was talking about um hplv and the fact

1461
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:55,358
that like on San Diego's finest that was

1462
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,280
one of the first times it popped up like

1463
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,400
people talking about it was gry skull

1464
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,200
talking about the sour no the Gorilla

1465
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,358
Glue Flo I think or sour dub one of the

1466
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:06,598
two um being quote unquote dted that was

1467
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:09,279
one of the first times it was ever

1468
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:11,200
brought up that was on there and later

1469
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,680
talking to Tumi and a few other places

1470
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,000
it sounds like sour dub was actually

1471
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:17,159
patient zero according to everything

1472
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,199
they've back traced that that might be

1473
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,480
where this

1474
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:24,000
weird however it was introduced from

1475
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,440
hops was onto the sour dub plant and

1476
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,400
then distributed maybe not at the

1477
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,280
beginning of sour dub but later on you

1478
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,760
know I wonder if it's possible as well

1479
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,640
that there were multiple patient zeros

1480
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:36,480
in different places at a or there

1481
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:38,879
literally was just one single point of

1482
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,400
origin I yeah don't know enough about

1483
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,119
these things um I don't know yeah I mean

1484
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,599
it it just seems s like such a random

1485
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:50,720
thing to bring a uh something over from

1486
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,240
pop cannabis I got to say as I was

1487
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,480
reading through those threads it was

1488
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:57,078
really interesting to kind of like see

1489
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,358
them talk about it without of course

1490
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:00,720
like you know without the context that

1491
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:03,679
we have now yeah yeah and it's almost

1492
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:06,318
like [ __ ] I don't know like

1493
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:08,759
uh I it's like a flashback in a movie or

1494
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:11,000
something where like you seeing the like

1495
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,720
origin of some villain or something you

1496
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,639
know and people like the first thoughts

1497
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,639
that or what people were saying about

1498
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:20,199
yeah this like evil presence that was

1499
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:21,598

1505
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:34,079
know I that's that's a part we didn't

1506
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,160
get to that I thought that would be

1507
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,960
interesting to talk about yeah Rob Rob

1508
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:40,960
didn't want to talk about that yeah

1509
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,079
again um the other thing that popped up

1510
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,358
in those threads that we didn't get to

1511
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,119
talk to I mean speak to although it's

1512
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:47,679
not like the most exciting topic but I

1513
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,640
did notice it was the Forum cut

1514
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,399
appearing in those threads as well and

1515
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:53,879
when that happened yeah like I said um

1516
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,920
that was around the time ape got it to

1517
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:02,039

1520
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:08,798
Cherry Pie and and cookies that was one

1521
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:11,159
of the first threads like just huge

1522
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:13,519

1523

people got to see in animal cookies too

1524
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,519
um so yeah and that was that was one of

1525
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,599
the first times I saw it and really got

1526
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,599
to see like this weird un same did he

1527
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,599
post those in the same thread or is like

1528
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:26,640
his own I don't remember if he started

1529
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:30,280
in San Diego's finest but I know up in

1530
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:34,960
there but he did have his own thread

1531
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:37,359
called lump status flowers I think right

1532
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,000
or lumpy GSC cherry pie or something

1533
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:43,838
like that yeah but he was a part of the

1534
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,400
the SD's finest crew too um yeah because

1535
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:47,558
you know one thing about going through

1536
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,318
the San Diego's finest threads is that

1537
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:52,760
there are a lot of pictures of old

1538
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:55,519
plants in those and I doubt that like

1539
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,640
you could like you if you searched on

1540
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,199
Google that you would find those

1541
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,159
pictures I think like you'd have to

1542
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:01,639
actually go and dig through them um but

1543
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,000
there's a lot still there I was quite

1544
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:06,639
surprised I was surprised that Rob

1545
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,838
pulled up the super hog it was an old

1546
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:12,960
line that me and James hog had worked on

1547
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:16,239
like the the um Hogs breath OG SoCal

1548
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,159
Master hybrid and like he text me's like

1549
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:20,959

1550
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:24,038
like I don't know 2009 is I think I have

1551
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,440
the super hot yeah it's [ __ ] like I

1552
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:28,960
haven't seen that in a long time totally

1553
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,960
forgot about that strain

1554
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:36,598
yeah wild to see

1555
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:37,798
that um I think I it was maybe the I

1556
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:42,960
don't know if I'd seen pictures of the

1557
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:45,639
p91 before that thre yeah they're up in

1558
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:49,039
there yeah so I I linked to those

1559
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:50,639
threads in the sub Rob part two episode

1560
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,520
um definitely encourage people who are

1561
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:55,358
interested in that to go and like have a

1562
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:57,639
browse I mean it's like four three or

1563
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,440
four three threads for the cuts one for

1564
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:02,879
seeds I think

1565
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,000
the the finest Cuts threads are like

1566
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:08,280
like two to 300 pages each yeah they're

1567
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,798
so long they're so long I was trying to

1568
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:13,400
get through all I was trying to like um

1569
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:16,599
quickly just literally flip through all

1570
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,559
the pages but it was so yeah much it'd

1571
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:21,280
be hard to intake all that info you know

1572
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:22,839
in a city I think what I was I was

1573
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,359
starting to just ignore all the text and

1574
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:26,279
just look at only the pictures but even

1575
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:28,279
that was a lot yeah that would that

1576
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,119
would still be

1577
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,680
intense yeah it's a lot there like going

1578
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,039
back and trying to restudy and reread

1579
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:36,159
that I was going through the same thing

1580
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:38,480
and some of the stuff I was remembering

1581
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,078

1582

like of course it's interesting to me

1592
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,599
because I was a part of some of that and

1593
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:10,119
and participated in it and uh had wild

1594
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,960
experiences in it met some of my best

1595
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:14,119
friends on Earth you know there um but I

1596
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,400
don't know how interested the audience

1597
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:16,720
is in it so leave a comment below and

1598

let us know if you want more of stuff

1599
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,439

1600
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:23,318
people that are nerdy as [ __ ] like I am

1601

been interesting I'm gonna guess that

1604
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,640
our audience is now like I want to say

1605
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,358
divided but they're obviously going to

1606
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,798
be different um groups within within the

1607
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,000
audience and I think we got a whole

1608
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,519
bunch of new people in through the

1609
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,920
growing episodes and yeah obviously a

1610
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:44,278

sure okay okay well maybe the other

1625
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:22,439
stuff I was thinking that we could just

1626
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:24,440
touch on even briefly is like um both

1627
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,798
the some of the I know you've been

1628
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,039
talking about these anyway but you know

1629
01:03:25,798 --> 01:03:29,639
some of the drops that have already

1630
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,839
happened and maybe upcoming upcoming

1631
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:36,278
drops so obviously it would be hard for

1632
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:38,078
us to like um go over everything but are

1633
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:41,440
there any like highlights for you I

1634
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:43,839
think from yeah so the past like few

1635
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,599
months we've had my blueberry incross

1636
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,519
drop that I'm super stoked about it's

1637
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,359
it's where I feel like I'm happiest with

1638
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:53,559
the the blue work at from Blue Bonnet

1639
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:55,318
and uh essentially DJ shorts blue blue

1640
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:58,079
bonnet that's what I'm happiest with

1641
01:03:55,318 --> 01:03:59,519
like being able to release that um we

1642
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,200

1643

1645
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:11,119
that's one of my favorite Haze lines uh

1646
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:14,039
that in Neville's Haze probably um and

1647
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:19,039
he made amazing crosses with it like so

1648
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:22,119
yeah I'm stoked on that um pack has

1649
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,240
another blue dream cross to drop still

1650
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:26,200
of reversals that haven't been announced

1651
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,278
and he just recently had one I knew

1652
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:30,639
about that yeah and he had one with the

1653

1656
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:42,679
phenomenal stuff we got to see some nice

1657
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:43,919
grows of all that in the patreon so yeah

1658
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:47,000
definitely join the patreon if you want

1659
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,680
to see like uh a lot of these tester

1660
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,719
picks and uh what else we have the oh

1661
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:53,798
Matt Elite drop like I've been trying to

1662
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,318
get Matt to drop for five years at least

1663
01:04:53,798 --> 01:05:00,119
at least um

1664
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:03,000
you know I grew his seeds very early on

1665
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:05,200
and I I was just blown away not not just

1666
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,880
by the seeds but by the human behind

1667
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:10,399
them um how good of a grower he was so I

1668
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,838
knew how in order to do selections you

1669
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,278
have to be able to grow a plant to its

1670
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,199
ultimate potential to see what it's

1671
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:19,798
capable of and because he's such a good

1672
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:21,919
grower his selections are phenomenal and

1673
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:24,000
um I got to see that by growing his work

1674
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,559
and for the last five years I've really

1675
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,199
wanted to get to get his stuff out there

1676
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:33,200
and he's just a very very much like uh

1677
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:37,239
bod in a sense like just very

1678
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:38,759
kind and doesn't like drama totally left

1679
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:40,159
the weed world because of drama just

1680
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,680
doesn't want to deal with it like too

1681
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:45,679
many people throw out negative energy is

1682
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:47,838
just not into it so he knew that

1683
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,440
releasing this might open himself up to

1684
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:53,038
some of that and he just wasn't into it

1685
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,838
at all but I'm very glad and thankful

1686
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,400
that he did because there's going to be

1687
01:05:54,838 --> 01:06:00,119
a lot of really really stoked people um

1688
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,838
OG's been missing from our community not

1689
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:06,358
not missing it was in abundance for a

1690
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:09,078
long time and then trying to find like

1691
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:11,358
really good OG Kush in regular seed form

1692
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:13,559
became damn near impossible like I had

1693
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:15,358
it in in hybrid seed form with blues and

1694
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:17,359
stuff but I didn't really keep a lot of

1695
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,719
the OG OG stuff because it was around so

1696
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,960
much back in the day but nowadays people

1697
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:26,000
are really trying to find that gassy

1698
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:29,480
gassy cushy you know that pinea gassy

1699
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,960
Fuel and that's all this is in Spades

1700
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,679
and it's in regular seed forms so you

1701
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:37,119
can make crosses with it and uh yeah and

1702
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:41,000
it's like 26 seeds a pack you know like

1703
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,680
he he hooked it up so I'm I'm I I'm over

1704
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,559
the moon about are some of them up

1705
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:47,440
already or are they like about to go up

1706
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,599
or no they're all up cool yeah yeah

1707
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,400
they're all up and available people

1708
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:52,200
stopped pestering you about when they're

1709
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,480
going up and yes people have stopped

1710
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:56,118
that and now it's more like when is he

1711
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,480
going to restock this one sold in 5

1712
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,559
minutes once he got to raise talk

1713
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,039
there's still some left but yeah it's

1714
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:03,960
they they went very fast especially the

1715
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:06,839
resurrection which is the uh line I've

1716
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,519
talked about the most the Kem 91 chmd

1717
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,199
I95

1718
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:14,278
because like the reason it was called

1719
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,838
Resurrection is because like he felt

1720
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:17,358
like and I didn't understand this until

1721
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:19,599
after I smoked it I was like that's why

1722
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:22,440
you called it Resurrection it was like

1723
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:25,000
Kem 91 but just with the turps turned up

1724
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,358
to I don't know just a ridiculous amount

1725
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,760
so you can smell all those the back

1726
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,400
smells that you'd smell on the clone of

1727
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,039
chm91 you'd be like man that would be

1728
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,920
really nice if it was you know a lot

1729
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:36,520
louder of that and it was just like all

1730
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,680
those scents turned up and um it was

1731
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:39,920
like resurrecting that old clone to be

1732
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:42,960
what those guys probably smelled when

1733
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,639
they first grew it um that Line's

1734
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,599
perfect it's absolutely perfect so that

1735
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:50,920
sold out like I think even less than

1736
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:54,440
five minutes like minute you know it was

1737
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,318
gone wild yeah I don't know I was stoked

1738
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:59,679
on it I was stoked to get

1739
01:07:56,318 --> 01:08:01,239
there yeah yeah it's nice to see that um

1740
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,239
you know you got the message out and

1741
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:07,679
people are definitely very very eager

1742
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:09,598
yeah for it I love that guy too so it

1743
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:10,798
makes me happy that he can because the

1744
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,318
other thing was he's like yeah nobody

1745
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:13,719
wants this [ __ ] nobody cares and I'm

1746
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:16,000
like for years I've been telling them

1747
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:18,599
dude you don't know you don't know I

1748
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,719
promise you you'll be surprised and of

1749
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,120
course like when things sold out he's

1750
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:26,798
like godd damn you know that's shocking

1751
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:28,640
but yeah shout out to man

1752
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,359
yeah and I hope uh H&amp;L doesn't mind me

1753
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,679
saying this but I feel like hnl also has

1754
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:34,239
been like quite really like

1755
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,679
self-deprecating about his work and I'm

1756
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,318
like why you like this why you so jaded

1757
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:40,440
I mean at the same time I'm like I also

1758
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:42,759
know why you're so jaded but he's just

1759
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:45,198
very humble farmer guy you know that's

1760
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:48,880
just him yeah him and Matt Elite are

1761
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:50,278
very very similar in in a lot of ways um

1762
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,759
and you know to be fair like I know what

1763
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:54,920
it's like to have been working in a

1764
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:57,399
space for a really long time it is it is

1765
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,920
easy to get like you know disillusioned

1766
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,719
or like feel a bit like me about the

1767
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,600
whole thing but his attitude is more

1768
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:06,480
like just seeds you know like that's

1769
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:09,079
just it just

1770
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:11,879
seats but yeah I think the mango hay

1771
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:13,559
stuff will get a great reception um I'm

1772
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,319
glad that most of the people buying it

1773
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,960
aren't people buying off of hype too

1774
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:19,000
because mango Haze isn't like something

1775
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,520
super hyped it's people that want to

1776
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,719
have a haze experience that understand

1777
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,080
what a haze experience would be and what

1778
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:29,119
it would entail to grow that it'll be

1779
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:31,318
long lanky you need to grow plenty of it

1780
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:33,158
to find a keeper people understand that

1781
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:35,120
that are buying it so that's I think

1782
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:38,198
that's super important too like lines

1783
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,439
can be received well and or ill-received

1784
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:41,960
based on who buys them like if you're

1785
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:44,639
not educated on Haze and you're buying

1786
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:48,920
it you probably won't be stoked

1787
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:51,480
um you know yeah yeah buy

1788
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,960
commercial yeah I think and I hope I'm

1789
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:54,319
not mistaken I have to go check again

1790
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,319
because you know you guys sent me so

1791
01:09:54,319 --> 01:10:00,399
much stuff but I think sent

1792
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:01,359
me dog [ __ ] you know e mango Haze he

1793
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:03,639
might

1794
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,920
have yeah hope I haven't gotten that

1795
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,440
wrong but that that seems kind of fun

1796
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,279
yeah makes

1797
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,399
sense he also had um freebies I think it

1798
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:14,119
was

1799
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:16,719
uh what was it can't remember what the

1800
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:19,679
female was but it was cross to C Vietnam

1801
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:22,239
Black so like an nl5 Haze oh yeah I

1802
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:25,319
vaguely remember but can't remember what

1803
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:27,000
theis Emil side was God damn it but yeah

1804
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,079
yeah know like I remember looking going

1805
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,039
[ __ ] these are the freebies that's fire

1806
01:10:29,079 --> 01:10:35,519
fire fire fire so yeah guys goow some

1807
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:37,920
and send Matt some yes send me some

1808
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,320

1809
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,480
yeah yeah send me some in eight months

1810
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:45,599
whenever it's

1811
01:10:41,479 --> 01:10:47,079
done [ __ ] oh man I impressed that you've

1812
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,120
I mean at the same time I I gathered

1813
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:52,439
like this like how bad it was how bad it

1814
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:56,198
was that this is what you're resorting

1815
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:58,879
to um so I also appreciate that I it was

1816
01:10:56,198 --> 01:11:01,119
a miserable experience um going through

1817
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,119
canono hyperemesis

1818
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,960
syndrome but this is a miserable

1819
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:07,559
experience because like I I have such

1820
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:10,480
bad anxiety all day and I really was

1821
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:13,440
using cannabis to cope with that and

1822
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,799
dabbing um and it really I don't know if

1823
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:18,079
it at the time I felt like it wasn't

1824
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:21,480
helping that much but like looking back

1825
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:24,840
like being sober all the time it

1826
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:27,439
definitely made a difference and it does

1827
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,000
it's major life change and I remember

1828
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,399
thinking like during the time when I was

1829
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
going through all the throwing up [ __ ]

1830
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:36,158
like thinking like you know slowly

1831
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,158
coming to the conclusion that maybe this

1832
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:42,119
is CHS and that I would have to stop for

1833
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,679
at least like a month to figure it out

1834
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:47,519
like thinking that it it would have to

1835
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,600
be the last resort in my life to ever

1836
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,400
come to that point where I would quit

1837
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,880
smoking for a month full to even find

1838
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:57,439
out just to find out and I was able to

1839
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:01,279
do it from the jump and never went back

1840
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:03,879
like I never re you know I I don't know

1841
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,960
but it sucks it sucks ass I cannot wait

1842
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,480
till time's up and I can start flooding

1843
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:11,000
my receptors

1844
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:12,759
again right maybe few were dabs when you

1845
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,760
come back yeah yeah I'm not going to dab

1846
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,800
anymore that's one thing I'm not going

1847
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,320
to do is dab um I really

1848
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:22,520
learned like I I I have a a hard time as

1849
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,799
a like a former addict and like I'm I'm

1850
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:27,719
an addict of a lot of different things

1851
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,400
in my life whether it's food or you know

1852
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:34,439
how I spend my time or interest how how

1853
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:36,198
OCD I get about stuff yeah yeah yeah I I

1854
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:38,399
don't realize when I'm being compulsive

1855
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:40,119
about stuff so like dabbing could be a

1856
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,319
real issue so I'm just not going to do

1857
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:43,960
it when it uh I'm able to smoke again

1858
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:45,920
flour I think I'll be fine with just

1859
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,719
flour and won't have any more issues if

1860
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:53,359
I go through this whole process and

1861
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:55,920
really do um clean my receptors out yeah

1862
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,920
yeah okay

1863
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,399
well um is there anything else you

1864
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,119
wanted to highlight otherwise we can

1865
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:03,799
move on to squirrel's this moved on to

1866
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:05,399
squirrel's question was a good question

1867
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,360
I mean what do you so you have a read of

1868
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:10,198
it I think you've got the the document

1869
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:12,599
on your screen um what do you I'm not

1870
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:14,359
I'm not 100% of on how to approach this

1871
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,960
I'll leave this to you I think like how

1872
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,839
do you interpret this question um he he

1873
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,960
was asking me to break down how scammers

1874
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:25,400
inflate generic terms over promising

1875
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:27,760
traits so I think I've talked about this

1876
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:29,279
briefly in different aspects and

1877
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,239
different respects to different lines we

1878
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:34,960
touching in many different ways MH but

1879
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:37,079
um like he said for an example like ABC

1880
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,840
sour Haze

1881
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,760
nl5

1882
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:44,639
um three different lines that are

1883
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:48,440
notoriously hard for line breeding

1884
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:51,359
so trying to breede

1885
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:54,238
certain okay let me let me rewind it

1886
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,759
back let's say you have a line and you

1887
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:58,759
grow out

1888
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,800
plants and only one of those plants has

1889
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,280
that expression and you grab that plant

1890
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,360
to breed with it right if you then cross

1891
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:08,920
it to something

1892
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:10,719
else you you wouldn't expect to see 50%

1893
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,960
of the population to be that because in

1894
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:15,600
its own population it was recessive it

1895
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,840
was very rare on the line if it was

1896
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,600
recessive it was just very rare

1897
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,239
occurring you know

1898
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,800
um I think that's what he's referring to

1899
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:28,319
in stuff like this like Haze it's self

1900
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:31,560
has tons of different Expressions so

1901
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:33,639
promising like a haze IBL is hard it's

1902
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,560
very hard to do uh it would take many

1903
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:38,600
years of breeding a haze in a certain

1904
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:42,520
direction because it's a a like one of

1905
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:45,719
the first poly hybrids um things like

1906
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:48,639
ABC uh a trait that isn't locked in

1907
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:50,800
until you're in the F4 generation

1908
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:54,279
roughly F3 F4 you're starting to see

1909
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,679
true beating traits of that uh ABC type

1910
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:59,920
like having a a one-off ABC hybrid would

1911
01:14:56,679 --> 01:15:03,158
be more hard to find that you know um

1912
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:06,319
what else do we got here sour now sour I

1913
01:15:03,158 --> 01:15:08,359
think can dominate in looks more often

1914
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:10,238
than it does in turps sour has a

1915
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:12,359
particular look so when people see that

1916
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,119
they think because it's very distinctive

1917
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:16,198
look I've got it yeah they think we've

1918
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:18,439
got it they think we got it for sure but

1919
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:22,319
that's just one trait out of everything

1920
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:24,638
that comprises sour um that burnt rubber

1921
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,920
nastiness in sour isn't necessar going

1922
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:29,920
to show up with that trait the look

1923
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,800
trait every time so I I think that's

1924
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,480
kind of what he means by this like we've

1925
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,600
seen a lot of sour different iterations

1926
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:39,959
of the generations and whatnot but like

1927
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,239
in um for example Karma saau like there

1928
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:45,158
was a lot of just mostly OG in that it

1929
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:48,799
looked like sour but it was a lot of OG

1930
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:50,920
turbs um and people really thought they

1931
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,400
had it you know just because it had the

1932
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:55,480
look so I think that's what he's

1933
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:58,359
referring to in this um I don't even

1934
01:15:55,479 --> 01:16:01,279
know if it's more of a a scammer thing

1935
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:03,719
as opposed to just like people that are

1936
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:06,559
behind the scenes making the seeds don't

1937
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:08,840
know what the [ __ ] they're talking about

1938
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,120
um they're not growing out enough plans

1939
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,480
to see that they haven't achieved what

1940
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:13,719
they're

1941
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:16,000
claiming nor do they understand how

1942
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:18,279
genetics work and that having a rare

1943
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,679
expression pop up in a line doesn't mean

1944
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:22,479
that they can cross it once and then

1945
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:24,440
that line is like half that yeah I think

1946
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:26,119
that's I think that's the key I think

1947
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:28,279
that's a key framing I think that's a

1948
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:29,519
good summary statement of this and I

1949
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:31,479
mean I had a

1950
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,320
different maybe this is another way to

1951
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:37,319
ask you this question which is

1952
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:39,079
like if you were you know uh you're

1953
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:42,559
trying to be responsible as a breeder or

1954
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:44,119
seed seller um knowing that like these

1955
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,120
things tend to be

1956
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:47,760
probabilistic um what's the best way to

1957
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:48,960
frame this kind of information because

1958
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,360
obviously you need to give people some

1959
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,639
information but you you kind also

1960
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:54,599
pretend that like you know absolutely

1961
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:56,880
what they're going to get so I guess you

1962
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,480
know one of my initial impulses to say

1963
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,920
well you can you know one thing that I

1964
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:03,359
do see people do is like present like a

1965
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:06,079
range right a range of expressions and

1966
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,839
say okay when when I grew this out when

1967
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:11,840
my testers grew this out we saw like you

1968
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:13,520
know some collection of possible traits

1969
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,239
and I guess that's maybe one of the ways

1970
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,280
you can approach it right like yeah the

1971
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:19,718
other way is to use a true breeding line

1972
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,238
as a parent that will help a lot you

1973
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:22,760
know like if one of those parents is

1974
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:25,119
very close to true breeding for several

1975
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:28,800
traits I mean that's why again why move

1976
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:32,519
on from Bonnet forever because it it's a

1977
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:35,600
tributing line like it regularly and

1978
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,080
reliably kicks blueberry turps and it

1979
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,520
has a very specific look has specific

1980
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:43,600
resin pattern type that it breeds true

1981
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:45,520
for in the sense that it in almost

1982
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,880
everything it's crossed to it'll occur

1983
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:52,000
more regularly than its partner in that

1984
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:54,679
sense um that makes it so you can say

1985
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,600
okay you can expect to see bury this

1986
01:17:54,679 --> 01:17:58,960
this that you know like three different

1987
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:01,239
main Expressions that helps because it

1988
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,639
it brings some accuracy um but the other

1989
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:05,718
way yeah is to just explain the

1990
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:07,679
different ranges the the different be be

1991
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:08,600
realistic about the flowering times too

1992
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,079
because a lot of people are not

1993
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,560
realistic about flowering times

1994
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:14,559
whatsoever in the

1995
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,520
descriptions yeah it reminds me didn't

1996
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,320
we did we not do a show where like we

1997
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,960
actually look through like some seed

1998
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,439
websites just to see what the marketing

1999
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,439
was like did we actually record that I

2000
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:26,759
don't I think we did I don't think we

2001
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:26,759
did

2002
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:31,638
I was goingon to say that like another

2003
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:33,119
time we could like we could pull up a

2004
01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:34,800
website in the background and actually

2005
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:36,639
show people who we're talking about just

2006
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,600
to like you know not rough too many

2007
01:18:36,639 --> 01:18:42,400
fills and like maybe like just comment

2008
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,520
on like the way that the information is

2009
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,079
Being Framed stuff like that uh we can

2010
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,120
do that another time I think that'd be

2011
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:50,800
fun I it' be a nice experience it would

2012
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:51,639
be funny it' be very funny I think make

2013
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,279
lots of

2014
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:56,000
friends I'm so sure we did it I I feel

2015
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:58,158
like I memory of you and I looking at

2016
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,359
say like Barney's Farm website I think

2017
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:01,238
we did you know what I think we did that

2018
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:03,198
for just like a few minutes of something

2019
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:05,158
but not a full episode of it it would be

2020
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:08,079
interesting to go through like open up

2021
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:09,399
the attitude let's go through the list

2022
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:11,279
that actually was that would be a great

2023
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:13,119
episode comment below if you want us to

2024
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,840
do that because I'll take the Heat and

2025
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:17,960
do it you know like I don't I think for

2026
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,920
the major seed banks it's not too you

2027
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,239
know it's not too scary because you know

2028
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,719
they're this like like you said it's

2029
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:24,079
like Walmart it's like who cares like

2030
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,600
Walmart the attitude anyway they're a

2031
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:29,479
bunch of [ __ ] that's what I say um

2032
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:31,199
they were [ __ ] to me [ __ ] them so but

2033
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:32,718
it's not even about them it's about the

2034
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:33,719
the Breeders they carrying though like

2035
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,480
we'd be going over the Breeders are

2036
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:38,880
carrying those are individuals um and uh

2037
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,000
yeah but I'm down to do it because like

2038
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,079
everybody should be held accountable

2039
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,840
including myself you know people hold me

2040
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:47,279
accountable all the time and ask me

2041
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:49,319
every question they can so why not

2042
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,800
everybody else you know I've talked

2043
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:53,319
about these ideas before like in a

2044
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,039
broader sense like uh I think that we we

2045
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:57,319
probably could do a different kind of

2046
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:58,679
reviews of like differents of cannabis

2047
01:19:57,319 --> 01:20:00,920
content but I just haven't really

2048
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:02,319
thought about how to frame it all like I

2049
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,520
think it would be very funny to do like

2050
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:08,519
a Strain Hunters one for example oh my

2051
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:10,199
God yeah um but again I don't know how

2052
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,120
you know practically I'm not sure but we

2053
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:14,678
can think about it I me yeah comment

2054
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:16,399
down below if you want us to review um I

2055
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:18,560
don't know mainstream I guess you'd call

2056
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:20,719
it mainstream Cana content I think it'd

2057
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:23,120
be fun to do like on the on the patreon

2058
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,880
Discord to load it up like a video and

2059
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:27,519
just have me talk over it but then again

2060
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,079
I'm probably oh yeah on the stage yeah

2061
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:32,800
yeah it would work on the stage it would

2062
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:32,800
be hilarious yeah I could do

2063
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:38,238
that okay um what were we talking about

2064
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:40,119
again oh yeah yeah that question yeah I

2065
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:41,559
think also it just reminds me that yeah

2066
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:43,039
like you said we have approached this

2067
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,360
question in like many different ways I

2068
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:47,000
think in the past like we had that whole

2069
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,399
episode on like white labeling we talked

2070
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,439
about it again with pico white labeling

2071
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:54,039
that side of the marketing we've talked

2072
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:56,559
about breeding in general and like how

2073
01:20:54,039 --> 01:21:01,439
you look at in terms of probability and

2074
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:04,039
like um you know what a true breeding um

2075
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,238
plant would do in a breeding project as

2076
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:07,119
opposed to something that you you know

2077
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:08,519
have no clue about or like you know

2078
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:10,960
whatever

2079
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,440
um in some ways this is just the

2080
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,840
question isn't it like this is the

2081
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:15,879
question we just come back to again and

2082
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:18,079
again which is how do you given the

2083
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:21,079
information that you have as a consumer

2084
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:23,960
or buyer of seeds or whatever like make

2085
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:26,359
decisions about what you're buying and

2086
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,520
it's I need to make B marter episode

2087
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:29,319
which would be like going through the

2088
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,679
attitude or something how do I how would

2089
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:35,119
someone experience go through and pick

2090
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:37,679
seeds you know if they're something

2091
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:40,119
specific something like that yeah yeah

2092
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,359
yeah we could do it we could do it

2093
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:42,800
because I think what we've done in the

2094
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:44,679
past has looked at it from a breeding

2095
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,119
point of view yeah but not necessarily

2096
01:21:44,679 --> 01:21:49,079
from the buyer's point of view no no

2097
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:51,719
it's yeah and I you know like a lot of

2098
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:53,760
what I was doing early on was because I

2099
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:56,600
was also a seed buyer not just a seed

2100
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,320
maker and I felt like people need to be

2101
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,679
protected like this their hard-earned

2102
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:02,719
money you know like people are getting

2103
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:04,000
swindled left and right not just people

2104
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:06,760
some of my friends were still getting

2105
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,399
swindled at this point you know still

2106
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,719
are and uh it' be nice to have something

2107
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:13,399
for them to understand like this is

2108
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:16,840
something I take into account when I'm

2109
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:19,039
looking at seeds and Seed buying from

2110
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:21,600
someone this far in that's from the

2111
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:23,600
opposite side of the spectrum go in look

2112
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,159
at other things and but I'm sure people

2113
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,600
would say I'm just a hater or you know

2114
01:22:25,158 --> 01:22:28,319
just hating on certain companies because

2115
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,000
I'm jealous or something but I

2116
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,880
realistically be it'd be nice to do from

2117
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,600
a seed buying perspective to help people

2118
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,440
I mean I have you know my current take

2119
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,840
on it is that like I just won't there's

2120
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:39,399
no way I would even consider buying

2121
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,960
anything if I just if I don't know the

2122
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:42,559
person and when I say don't know them I

2123
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,840
don't even mean like I recognize their

2124
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,039
brand I mean like if I haven't talked to

2125
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,520
them and I don't know what they're about

2126
01:22:46,039 --> 01:22:50,960
I'm not even going to consider it you

2127
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,480
should be able to ask questions and yeah

2128
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,600
yeah be able to be relatable to these

2129
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,959
people because at the end of the day

2130
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,320
rock stars I'll put it differently as

2131
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,439
well like there's so much good work that

2132
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:03,119
can be trusted or like good work from

2133
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,519
good people who can already be trusted

2134
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:08,039
so why would you even like bother with

2135
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,239
like yeah anyway been that from the

2136
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:11,479
rooftops forever like why even waste

2137
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:15,439
your money like that when there's

2138
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:16,638
already good people yeah yeah yeah

2139
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:18,198
you're not going to be rewarded for like

2140
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:22,400
taking risks in that regard I don't

2141
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:25,238
think no no no there's not a lot good to

2142
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:27,719
find that way

2143
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:29,399
yeah okay well I think that's good that

2144
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:31,319
kind of signals that yeah maybe we do we

2145
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:33,599
should do a show on on that specifically

2146

trolls and [ __ ] this one handles itself

2196
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:37,158
I mean it's pretty self- policing if

2197
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:39,840
someone doesn't fit in and they're just

2198

being rude and and hurtful they don't
