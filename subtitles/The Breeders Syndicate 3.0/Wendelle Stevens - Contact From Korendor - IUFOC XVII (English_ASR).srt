[Music]

6
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,359
morning with one of our very favorite

7
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,080
speakers of all time

8
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,079
um today wendell is going to take us on

9
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,120
a journey back almost 50 years

10
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,879
to a little-known case

11
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,759
which at the time was largely ignored

12
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,478
but with what we know now

13
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,080
probably shouldn't have been rather

14
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,319
important case

15
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,319
most of us do not know much about it

16
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,180
it's going to be a treat ladies and

17
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,879
gentlemen please welcome wendell

18
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,840
[Applause]

00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,839
thank you bob

20
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,959
thank you ladies and gentlemen

21
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,960
it's nice to see so many old friends

22
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,000
back here

23
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,918
i

24
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
have a little announcement to make to

25
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,560
start off with i'm always asked at these

26
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,879
conferences why don't you republish that

27
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,478
picture book well it's too expensive for

28
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,680
us to do it we never did it never

29
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,240
intended to

30
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,439
but one has been published michael

31
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
whalen

32
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,199
who founded the

33
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,160
american figure got permission from

34
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,240
billy to redo it and he redid it right

35
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,240
from the original slide transparency and

36
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,639
the pictures are much sharper here

37
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,879
than anything else i don't have any for

38
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,478
sale here but there's some bookmarks on

39
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,879
the stage here you can pick up with an

40
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,279
address you can contact for it

41
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,038
now my presentation today

42
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,279
is going to be about

43
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,439
the bob renaud case

44
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,559
i don't think many of you remember that

45
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,639
but with

46
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,079
at my age with a little bit of hindsight

47
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,478
i can look back

48
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,399
and see one that we popularly threw out

49
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,839
at the time probably shouldn't have been

50
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,159
because

51
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,839
now we have all of the features of that

52
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
case have been repeated in other cases

53
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,359
and

54
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,560
somewhat contemporary with this case

55
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
were

56
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
the cases of george adamski

57
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,719
which has been

58
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,478
criticized

59
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,639
over and over again

60
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,839
everybody tried to call him a charlatan

61
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
and a fraud

62
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,679
but you know

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,879
nobody really investigated that case in

64
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,879
this country

65
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,918
the only person that really investigated

66
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,879
the adept case was bruce cathy from new

67
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,519
zealand

68
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,120
an airline pilot that came up here went

69
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,279
to mr adamski

70
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,079
went over all the sites went back to the

71
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,318
earth contact site and everything and

72
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:36,159
his report in one of his books is the

73
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,319
only real report on the adamski case

74
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,720
now the rest of them took their cue from

75
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,000
the lorenzens from afro

76
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,199
and afro was the first

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,839
world or first ufo civilian or civilian

78
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,759
ufo research organization in the world

79
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,758
after nightcaf which was not really

80
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
civilian

81
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
and

82
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,839
coral and jim when when the newspapers

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
began to report the identity case out

84
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,799
there in los angeles carl and jim went

85
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,960
to visit george adamski

86
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,120
now carl was a beautiful lady but she

87
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,719
was

88
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,759
had an acid tongue

89
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,919
and

90
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
she was not very kind to people that

91
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,279
they interviewed

92
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,638
so when they got to vista california he

93
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,079
wasn't home

94
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,879
people at the house told me he was

95
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,639
eating dinner little diner down the road

96
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,000
operated by i believe it was by his

97
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,280
sister or sister-in-law or something

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,439
and so they went down there and they

99
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,879
found george at his table eating his

100
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,639
breakfast

101
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,560
and they he invited him to sit down they

102
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,840
sat down across from him and

103
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,399
carl in her usual

104
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,399
way to begin such investigations

105
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,758
fold her fingertips like this said

106
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,239
george just how the hell did you do it

107
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,080
and he immediately

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,519
suspected that they're not there to get

109
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,199
facts that they're there to pin him to

110
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,719
the wall so he said my dear lady you

111
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
just take a hubcap and throw it in the

112
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,199
air

113
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,799
and photograph it so that's what the the

114
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,439
lorenzo has published in the afro

115
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,680
bulletin and being the pioneer everybody

116
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,079
else copied from the april bulletin

117
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,720
and nobody investigated the case after

118
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,279
that until bruce kathy so

119
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,680
this is something like that now let me

120
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,439
add a couple of comments here i was

121
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,120
inves lou zinstag in basel switzerland

122
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,959
brought me the meyer case

123
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
we'd been exchanging photographs and she

124
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,478
heard about the case in her backyard

125
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,918
and she called me one day and said

126
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,519
i'm going to be coming to the united

127
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,958

133
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,440
leah and brit elders happened to be in

134
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,640
my house at the time when i picked her

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,160
up and brought her out to the house and

136
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,360
she showed us the pictures for the first

137
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,240
time

138
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
they were really great and

139
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
i

140
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,080

my arrangements go back in and start my

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,839
investigation of the case myself

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,240
but she was

144
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,000

145
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,440

154
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959

00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,000
he owned a jewelry store there so that's

174
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,759
i know it's all true

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,759
and i don't think that he could have

176
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,799
faked it

177
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,200
others

178
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,359
similar to that were kelvin rowe

179
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
orpheo angelucci

180
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
violet gilbert i got to tell you about

181
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,838
violet gum you probably never heard of

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,519
her she was a contactee in santa barbara

183
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,760
california

184
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,560
and her visitors

185
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,078
agreed one time to let her photograph

186
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,119
their ships

187
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:36,319
and she told a

188
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,200
photography friend that owned a photo

189
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,800
processing shop at a studio in santa

190
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,959
barbara what was going to happen and

191
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,799
what was the best film to get and he

192
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,000
said oh by all means we should get coat

193
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,919
of color because it's the sharpest

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,799
and she invited him to go with her and

195
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,479
so she took her handheld 35 millimeter

196
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,319
camera and an eight millimeter movie

197
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,920
camera and rolled the film

198
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
he did the same and he took a four by

199
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,439
five press camera with him took pictures

200
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,719
with that also

201
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
now the the visitors appeared on time

202
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,160
they took pictures of it flying overhead

203
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,319
they took pictures of it making an

204
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,799
approach it took pictures of it landing

205
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
and occupants getting out

206
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,599
and the the uh

207
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,440
contact only lasted about a half an hour

208
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
but they quickly snapped a lot of

209
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
pictures they shot all their almost all

210
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,799
of their film

211
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,759
so after this event

212
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,078
they rushed right to the

213
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,039
back to the studio to turn in the film

214
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:36,958
for processing they both went to a

215
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:39,278
five-point uh grocery drugstore that had

216
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,278
a film processing center there

217
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,879
and they turned their film in at that

218
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,399
time you had to wait about two weeks for

219
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,039
it to be processed

220
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,639
and sent back now they don't process

221
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,399
code of color

222
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,240
except in licensed processing

223
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
laboratories there's only five at that

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
time there was four in the united states

225
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,159
and one in hong kong

226
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,000
so all the code of color film had to go

227
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,360
to one of the licensed processing

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
laboratories

229
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,159
so when they went back to pick their

230
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,560
film up two weeks later on schedule

231
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,799
they got a u-goof slip in the envelope

232
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,439
instead no film nothing came back the

233
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,879
slip says you may have had you

234
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
taken your pictures with the lens on the

235
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,240
camera might have had your thumb over

236
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,479
the over the lens but the pictures

237
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
didn't come out and you were entitled to

238
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,839
a free roll of film take it to your

239
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
nearest supplier

240
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,440
both of them got the u-group slips now

241
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,879
that's a little

242
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
little unusual

243
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,958
and they're the the the one man was an

244
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,799
expert photographer

245
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,958
for him to leave the lens on actually he

246
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,319
was using through the lens camera anyway

247
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,759
he couldn't see anything if the lens cap

248
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
was on

249
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,919
so uh

250
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,839
when i heard about this i was visiting

251
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,919
out there and and guilt violet was

252
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,959
telling me what happened to the film and

253
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,120
i said

254
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,799
well why don't you send them to

255
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,919
take him to a kodak shop or something

256
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,199
like that

257
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,278
so

258
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,360
she took hers to a kodak shop he sent

259
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,399
his ups through his own channels and

260
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,079
again they both got you goof slipped

261
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,320
so she's telling me this and she said

262
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,078
i've got one roll of 35 millimeter film

263
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
left if you think you can get it

264
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,919
processed i'll give it to you

265
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,000
i said yeah i can get it processed let

266
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,039
me have it and i'll see what i can do

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,278
so at that time i was in touch with

268
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,439
bob beck robert beck who was the head of

269
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,958
color control processing code of color

270
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,040
film for the film studios out in

271
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,879
hollywood

272
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,399
and he said yes i can get it developed

273
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,320
for you i said i'm only going to leave

274
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,000
it with if you could guarantee me that

275
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,959
you could return the roll of film

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,200
process or the role of film unprocessed

277
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,599
but in any case i've got to have the

278
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,839
original film back

279
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,040
process to run process

280
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,240
he said i can i can do it for you

281
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,159
he says come back in about 10 days and i

282
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
left and i got a call from him two days

283
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,319
later and he said come down to the

284
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,079
office

285
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
so i went down to see bob and he had the

286
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,559
roll of film on his desk he says mr

287
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,040
stevens i can't guarantee you that i can

288
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,278
return this film if we process it

289
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,799
he said i wasn't aware of this wasn't

290
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,120
familiar with this but he says my lab

291
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,159
chief says that we have we are governed

292
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,919
by a classified government directive

293
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,198
that regulates all

294
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,198
code of color

295
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,879
licensed processing agencies again

296
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,599
there's only five

297
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,600
and they have to report certain things

298
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,360
seen on film and he says what you

299
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,199
describe on here is one of the subjects

300
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,079
that we have to report they'll send

301
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,159
somebody to take a look at it and

302
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,719
you may not get it back so i said don't

303
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,639
process i'll give it back to the owner

304
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,160
and that's what happened to that anyway

305
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
that was a good case she got a lot of

306
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,639
good pictures she didn't get much

307
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,920
publicity but it was a remarkable case

308
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,039
and there would have been some marvelous

309
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,120
evidence if

310
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,559
if we could have gotten it

311
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
the next one

312
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,838
that was contemporary with george was

313
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,480
the mitchell sisters now if you remember

314
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,240
george adamski said his contacts were

315
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,800
with venusians

316
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,360
and the mitchell sisters said their

317
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,639
contacts were with martians but in the

318
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,199
mitchell sister's case they had

319
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,320
venusians aboard the martian spacecraft

320
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,319
and then in the

321
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,039
violet gilbert case they mentioned

322
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,560
martians working with them

323
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,559
there was another case uh

324
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,559
halsey

325
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,799
lieutenant commander halsey i think his

326
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,119
name was

327
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,838
his uncle was bull halsey who he said

328
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,639
also had contacts

329
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,680
but this lieutenant commander halsey

330
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,759
was on

331
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,958
at the end of the war when we had a cut

332
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,800
back in money

333
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,039
and we couldn't return everybody at one

334
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,198
time the peachy boat commanders were

335
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,519
given grids in the pacific to run to

336
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,799
patrol until they could be returned and

337
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,000
retired

338
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,838
and

339
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,240
halsey young commander halsey was

340
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,079
running his grid with his patrol boat

341
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,959
when it ran onto solid ground in open

342
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,838
ocean and was lifted up in the water

343
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,359
he never saw this before us not on the

344
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,079
charts and he jumped overboard and he

345
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,720
jumped down onto a solid object

346
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,000
it kept rising and his his pt boat is

347
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,040
high and dry

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,120
then a cutting tower came up out of the

349
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,198
hard surface the door opened and the man

350
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,600
stepped out took him aboard

351
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,120
and showed him around and

352
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,360
told him that they had been observing

353
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,560
him for some time they knew him by his

354
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
first name

355
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,319
i told him that they they showed him

356
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
around then when they let him go they

357
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,959
told him that the time was up and that

358
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,399
they would

359
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,000
be would be

360
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,000
would see him again

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
and they did they came back

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,958
several times while he was still

363
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
patrolling in the pacific and when he

364
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,559
returned

365
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
home to california

366
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,919
uh told his wife about what was

367
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
happening she said i'd like to meet him

368
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,319
he's someone the next time he had a was

369
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,399
summoned for a contact he told him about

370
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,879
his wife's desire and they said that's

371
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,198
okay we consider you a unit

372
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,958
bring her along so he did and then him

373
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,719
and his wife would

374
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,319
meet them at rendezvous points that

375
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,079
would be sent to them through the mail

376
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,839
they'd receive a letter with a

377
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,599
rendezvous point at a certain place in

378
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,639
time and would they go there

379
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,679
the

380
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,400
venusians they said they were

381
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,319
met them and sometimes the venusians

382
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,038
came with a martian one time they came

383
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,119
with a martian couple and they all had

384
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,679
dinner and a restaurant together now

385
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,558
this is a little difficult to accept we

386
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,319
don't

387
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,838
when we look at venus

388
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:26,159
we see

389
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:28,960
a hot surface 800 degrees centigrade

390
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,720
40 atmospheres of pressure nothing could

391
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,880
live there

392
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
as we understand it in our physical

393
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,640
sense and we have to remember

394
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,200
that when when we look up we're looking

395
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
up through physical eyes with physical

396
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,480
senses

397
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,200
and all the instrumentation we build is

398
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,720
to simply extend or augment our physical

399
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,120
senses

400
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,319
the venusians explain that their life

401
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,639
wave

402
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,480
does not vibrate to the same frequency

403
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
as ours that the life wave is a little

404
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
bit finer

405
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,280
in

406
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
in density of vibration or density of

407
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,879
frequencies

408
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,798
and something equivalent to our lower

409
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
astral and that when they come here they

410
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,200
have to slow down their vibrations to

411
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,360
interact with us physically

412
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,038
since we can't speed up our vibrations

413
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,639
they interact with them

414
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,798
in their reality

415
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,240
their astral reality we we don't

416
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,319
perceive them

417
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,160
but that doesn't mean they're not there

418
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,720
they say and there are a lot of visitors

419
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,840
from the venus and life wave come to

420
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,038
this planet

421
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:32,639
they say that that their life wave

422
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,240
exists in a vibrational level above the

423
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
physical level that we see when we look

424
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,200
at venus

425
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,798
and someplace in the clouds and that

426
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,279
they have

427
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,798
trees and plants and rivers and flowers

428
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,678
mountains and everything that we have

429
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,480
but

430
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,480
in their density of reality appropriate

431
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,759
to their density of reality

432
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,759
so we have

433
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,319
a number of cases of

434
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,200
visitors from venus describing such

435
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,759
conditions and we are unable to test

436
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,279
them because we just can't see into that

437
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,079
and

438
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,240
one of the venusians offered a a reverse

439
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,720
situation said if somebody else looking

440
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,960
at the earth whose sight was denser than

441
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,759
the earth site and looked at your planet

442
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,480
and saw only the top of the molten

443
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,000
lava layer under the basaltic crust he

444
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
would think that was your surface of

445
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,440
your planet because the rest is

446
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,240
transparent to it and he said that would

447
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,360
be a river situation from between earth

448
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,279
and venus

449
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,199
so now

450
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,240
we

451
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
we have

452
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,279
getting up to the contract we want to

453
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,079
talk about they said

454
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,160
that they came from another planet also

455
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,879
and that they had to make a change to

456
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,440
remain here in comfortably and in a

457
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,799
physical sense

458
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,558
all these others by the way were

459
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,200
successfully put down

460
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,119
by the ufo clubs who are really their

461
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,038
own worst enemies

462
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,439
for lack of money and resource for

463
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,519
proper investigation they never could go

464
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,279
anyplace and do anything they had member

465
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,798
subscribers that barely paid for the

466
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,119
publication but they never could afford

467
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,679
to send anybody anywhere

468
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,119
to say a week or two in another country

469
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,640
or elsewhere and do any kind of

470
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,879
investigation

471
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,759
if a club couldn't own you they attacked

472
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,360
you that was that was norm

473
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,839
if they did own you others did the

474
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,158
attacking so that was the situation with

475
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,879
the case we want to talk about involving

476
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,880
bob renaud

477
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,200
so i went back through the contact cases

478
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,479
that i'm familiar with

479
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,200
and i made a list of things in common

480
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,720
with other ufo cases and this seems to

481
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,400
be

482
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,960
we seem to have a pretty much of a

483
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
general application here

484
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,038
they all

485
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,720
the ones that

486
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,839
interact with us that we are concerned

487
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,759
about

488
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,639
are human in appearance just like us

489
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,079
when we see them they look like us they

490
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,400
just

491
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,839
a little bit different in morphology

492
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,519
ears a different shape lips in different

493
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,599
shape eyes a different shape color a

494
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,960
little different but they're human

495
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,279
placental animals like us

496
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,960
they're always using a variety of

497
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,678
different ships they don't come in just

498
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
one type in most cases there's more than

499
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,280
one type

500
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,640
making the approach and the contact

501
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:17,038
and this seems to be a norm also

502
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
most of them speak our languages

503
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,400
fluently

504
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,519
and they before they can interact with

505
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
us of course they have to learn the

506
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,599
language so that means a period of

507
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,480
observation before the contact is ever

508
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,639
made

509
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,400
and we're not aware of that until the

510
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,280
contact is made by that time they know

511
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,280
quite a bit about us

512
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,720
they are also careful uh make careful

affairs earth

515
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,639
concepts they use marvelous technologies

516
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,240
like ultralight speeds they can read

517
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,200
thoughts they use our radio and

518
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,880
television communications at will

519
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,558
they use all of our communications

520
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,600
including telegraph and computers as

521
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,440
well and we've had examples of

522
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:04,879
other forms of communication used by the

523
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,960
way back to the adamski case he was told

524
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,039
to go to that diner at near blythe

525
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,480
by his friends in a con

526
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,319
a contact

527
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,759
about the same time george hunt

528
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,960
williamson got

529
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,440
word from his sources to go to the same

530
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,480
diner south of life

531
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,679
and a railroad telegraph operator from a

532
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,240
little town outside of prescott

533
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,080
received over the railroad telegraph

534
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,599
where he had his contacts had been

535
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,720
coming over the railroad telegraph

536
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,519
regularly

537
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
he recognized the source it was it was a

538
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,519
practice with him that was their way of

539
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,079
communication and they sent him and his

540
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,839
wife to the same diner

541
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,158
south of life

542
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,558
and adamski and george hunt williamson

543
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,600
and his wife and al bailey and his wife

544
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:53,599
all met

545
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,599
at the diner

546
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,439
and decided

547
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,798
that they're on the same

548
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
since they've all been sent there by

549
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,359
their

550
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,960
sources

551
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,759
they

552
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,519
certainly nothing is going to happen

553
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,759
on the highway in front of the diner so

554
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,679
they got in their cars and going to

555
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,519
drive up to a remoter area the women had

556
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,240
packed lunch and they were going to

557
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,839
go up out of town and have a picnic and

558
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
they chose the road north towards the

559
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,439
mountains

560
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,120
they went up there a little ways and

561
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,880
stop for the picnic you know the rest of

562
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,119
the story the george adamski story by

563
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,840
the way the reason he had the water in

564
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,678
placer paris in his car is his contacts

565
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,918
told him to take the water and plaster

566
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,640
of paris before he left

567
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,600
to go to the diner

568
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
so

569
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,480
those that like to dismiss the adapsky

570
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,519
case

571
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,599
fred steckling has a table in here and

572
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,200
his father was the one that interacted

573
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,319
regularly and frequently with george

574
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,679
adamski

575
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,278
and

576
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,240
you can get more information from him

577
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:53,359
but

578
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,440
i

579
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,678
i have to wonder if the georgia napster

580
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,278
case is such a patent fraud why did the

581
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,960
united states government

582
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,759
send a government airplane to pick him

583
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,079
up at miramar every time you had a

584
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,079
substantive contact and fly him to the

585
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,240
pentagon for debriefing

586
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,359
and then flying back to miramar in a

587
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,359
military airplane that means that

588
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,759
they didn't think he was a fraud and

589
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,079
they they invited him often invited him

590
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,599
to stay in the pentagon in the pentagon

591
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,278
guest facilities overnight which he

592
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,879
always refused to do

593
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,119
he would leave the pentagon take the

594
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,120
ferry across the potomac and go to the

595
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,959
rotifer's home

596
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,399
across the river from the pentagon he

597
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,919
always stayed there because he didn't

598
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,480
know what might happen if he stayed in

599
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,480
the pentagon

600
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,519
now

601
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,599
the

602
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,000
most of the visitors use

603
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:46,798
tractor or levitation beams they pick

604
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,038
their their subjects up equipment also

605
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,960
in a beam of light that

606
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,278
that lifts it and they can move it and

607
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,400
place it wherever they want it

608
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,319
none of them

609
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,278
that i've encountered have had any money

610
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,839
system

611
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,359
like ours they their system is entirely

612
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,759
different they don't carry cash and they

613
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,119
don't have bills

614
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,720
most of them have

615
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,719
no religions like ours

616
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,440
all of them have intrusive observational

617
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,720
technologies and technologies and can

618
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,320
look in on anything we're doing

619
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,759
some of them had underground and other

620
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,839
water bases and what i'm going to talk

621
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,798
about does have both

622
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,798
here on this planet

623
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,439
many of them limited their direct

624
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,038
contact with humans to a very few

625
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,640
selected individuals and they didn't

626
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,000
allow it to be

627
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,679
broadened

628
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,558
i'll tell you what

629
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,880
why

630
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,480
are one reason that may be why when i

631
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,679
was investigating the pleiades case of

632
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
course i always wanted to meet the

633
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,960
palladiums like everybody else

634
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,120
and he billy meyer had his close friend

635
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,798
guido moosbruger his wife

636
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,798
and a couple others that he wanted to

637
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,798
take into the case with him to meet

638
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,480
samyasi

639
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,720
and finally he

640
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,960
resorted to a little trick he put

641
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,360
one of them over under a poncho on the

642
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
back of his moped when he was going to a

643
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,959
rendezvous

644
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,400
and in this was on a

645
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,759
night in january in the middle of the

646
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,278
night at two o'clock in the morning

647
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,079
actually cold as heck

648
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,599
and

649
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,599
in the forest on the way to the

650
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,599
rendezvous site they told them to stop

651
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,480
and let the passenger off

652
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,278
they weren't welcome or they would leave

653
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,519
so he put the woman off in the snow

654
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,798
with no cold wheel or gear and went to

655
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,079
meet the rendezvous he said he'd be

656
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,119
right back

657
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,199
he's in the warm ship with samyasi and

658
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,079
he says aren't you sorry for that poor

659
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,840
woman back there in the cold

660
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,278
and samyasi said we told you not to

661
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,439
bring her and he said i don't understand

662
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,359
this at all why can't i bring somebody

663
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,038
in you know is this is it what's so

664
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,798
secret about all this

665
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,000
she says no big thing and it's no big

666
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,319
secret she said the problem comes

667
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,400
when we when the second person enters

668
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,678
the scene she said

669
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,320
everybody

670
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,320
doesn't have the same concepts doesn't

671
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,000
have the same background

672
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,480
they have different background different

673
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,240
languages different educational

674
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,240
levels different understandings of

675
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,440
different things and she said they don't

676
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,200
all see

677
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,519
everything the same way

678
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,440
she says witness five

679
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,798
witnesses to an automobile accident they

680
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,200
already describe it and there are

681
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,798
details that their despair disparity

682
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,880
discrepancy between the details when

683
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,599
they go to make comparisons later she

684
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,480
said the problem comes when the second

685
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,398
third and other people enter the case

686
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,839
because they won't see it

687
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:36,079
exactly the same way you do and in time

688
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,599
they begin to group up they some will

689
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,798
agree and others don't agree and then

690
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,719
more agree and then they have more

691
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,200
factions she said look at your christian

692
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,038
religions you have 220 different

693
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,360
factions each one believing he has the

694
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,398
true source she says this is what

695
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,319
happens when you expand the context she

696
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,398
says it's more economical to us to

697
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,398
simply stop the context with you and

698
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,798
start with somebody else that hasn't

699
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,839
that does not have these needs in order

700
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,158
to

701
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,000
work productively so after that i kept i

702
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,919
stopped trying to get into context of

703
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,960
course everybody else did too

704
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,360
but

705
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,319
now we knew why it's not going to happen

706
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,319
and maybe never going to happen

707
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,879
the uh

708
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,200
oh and

709
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,080
for that reason all contacts

710
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,679
were limited to single contactees

711
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,359
as far as i know i don't know of any

712
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,320
case where except for the husband and

713
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,959
wife team where they more than one

714
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,599
contact or or contact he was admitted

715
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,600
into the case

716
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,240
they most of them spoke of an

717
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,159
organization of planets

718
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,599
of some kind

719
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,960
in the case of the

720
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:50,558
solar cross brothers channeled by uh

721
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,558
the young guy what was his name uh

722
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,120
who

723
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,440
yeah

724
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,359
miller dick miller

725
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,880
and

726
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,240
they uh

727
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,640
spoke of

728
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,558
an organization of planets that they

729
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,159
were a member of

730
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:07,678
and it included a lot of the local

731
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,760
planets here

732
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,640
uh

733
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,599
that the the corinthians speaking to bob

734
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,880
renaud described two major organizations

735
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,839
that are in

736
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,559
are

737
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,879
have operations in our sector of space

738
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,759
and they did not include the solar cross

739
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,919
group

740
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,158
they had an alliance of planets and a

741
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,440
confederation of planets there roughly

742
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,320
we'll go into that a little bit more

743
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,519
later

744
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:37,678
but there does to seem to be

745
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,440
a system of organization beyond earth

746
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,278
some of the visitors have bases on our

747
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,278
moon of course the corinthians did too

748
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,519
some of them mentioned well a number of

749
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,079
mentioned mars and venus beings visiting

750
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,359
earth and so do the

751
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,079
corinthians

752
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,798
and there are other witnesses involved

753
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,960
now the first information

754
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,879
if i can find the

755
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
pointer here

756
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,679
okay we'll

757
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,600
bring up a slide here

758
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,038
that's what i just covered that

759
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,079
information there

760
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,759
i hope it's readable

761
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,720
this is

762
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,599
the

763
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,399
first publication that put out anything

764
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,319
on the bob renaud case this is

765
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,000
the ufo international

766
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:31,839
put out by afsca american amalgamated

767
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,839
flying saucers company

768
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,278
uh put up by the gabriel green gabriel

769
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,759
green was

770
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,200
a young man that inherited the family

771
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,158
fortune

772
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,519
and took it to organize a research ufo

773
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,960
research group

774
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,519
and started publishing a little magazine

775
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,720
and this is one of his early issues

776
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,798
actually there were several issues

777
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,519
before this but what you see here

778
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,839
is a picture on the cover

779
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,879
done by a staff artist

780
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,639
of a corinthian vehicle that was

781
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,120
manufactured on corondora and

782
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,759
transported here by a telemetric process

783
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,959
it was apported here but from corridor

784
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,398
and we'll go into that a little bit

785
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,759
later

786
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,798
this next one is a succeeding issue

787
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,038
of

788
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,038
the afsca journal it's also ufo

789
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:25,278
international is what it was titled

790
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:27,200
uh had another some more of the story

791
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,240
here is gabriel greene the publisher of

792
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,679
the

793
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,679
that journal

794
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,120
uh

795
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,640
he uh

796
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,879
he had a pretty good well-going

797
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,880
organization he went to the giant rock

798
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,960
convention there's still a few old folks

799
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,000
here that remember the conventional

800
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,600
giant

801
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,640
giant rock in california may even

802
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,398
remember gabriel green at one time the

803
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,080
independent party in the united states

804
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,239
rely on him for as a candidate for

805
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,359
president

806
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,319
and we'll go into that a little bit

807
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,359
later

808
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,678
here is the report that i

809
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,599
summarized from the work done by gabriel

810
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,000
green back in the

811
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:06,639
in the early 60s

812
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,759
and this is what the cover that i worked

813
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,679
out for

814
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,278
the book that i am putting out by the

815
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,679
way the book is only in e-book format

816
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,000
couldn't afford to publish a hard copy

817
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,080
and the back cover of the book looks

818
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,079
something like this well it looks like

819
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,079
we've lost one

820
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,240
sticking slide there it is

821
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,199
back cover the book and

822
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,038
that is uh actually lost the back cover

823
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,120
but that's the diagram

824
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,558
of the ship now let me see if i can find

825
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,199
a pointer here

826
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,359
on the left-hand side you see a little

827
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,360
craft a board a little disc shaped crap

828
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,000
with a dome

829
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,000
that's a

830
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
one of the smaller scouts it only

831
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
carries one or two people

832
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,359
and it's carried aboard this other

833
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,839
larger scout also shuttlecraft

834
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,558
and

835
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:00,558
was bob renaud was eventually

836
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,960
shown how to operate this little craft

837
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,639
operates very simply and he was shown

838
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,319
how to operate it and

839
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,919
a couple of times they sent the craft to

840
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,319
pick him up in the driveway in front of

841
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,559
his house with nobody else aboard the

842
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,079
canopy would go up all by itself and a

843
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,960
voice would invite him aboard and he'd

844
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,678
get in

845
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,399
and it would fly him out to the

846
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,399
shuttle craft

847
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,960
now bob renaud appeared one time

848
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,039
on the platform describing his case and

849
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,240
that was at uh buck nelson's program

850
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,000
back in wisconsin i think it was

851
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,240
mountain view miss wisconsin in about

852
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,359
1967.

853
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,679
and

854
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,240
oh here we go thank you very much

855
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,240
and uh

856
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,440
okay we got one

857
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,119
and so

858
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,320
and he was attacked by the

859
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,398
debunkers

860
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,639
and ridiculed for telling his story

861
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:53,439
because there it was one of the earlier

862
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,880
stories of ongoing contact

863
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,240
and

864
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,720
he decided

865
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,798
that he his problem and trying to answer

866
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,360
the question is nobody wants to listen

867
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,639
to it a substantive answer they want to

868
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,599
ask a one-line question they want a

869
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,039
one-line answer it's hard to do

870
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,719
i often get those in the swiss case

871
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,199
and so he

872
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,838
he decided that he didn't have time to

873
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,519
educate the closed minds and he didn't

874
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,239
have any particular interest in it

875
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:25,679
anyway he knew his truth he had his own

876
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,678
facts and he didn't feel any need to

877
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,559
persuade anybody else to believe what he

878
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,119
already knew himself and so he refused

879
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,480
to go on a platform anymore he stopped

880
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,480
sending his uh

881
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,240
reports to gabriel green

882
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,320
and just kept them all to himself the

883
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,239
context continued but

884
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,559
the

885
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,678
carl and annie white in wiesbaden

886
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,679
germany

887
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,720
an organization they called deweest

888
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,519
published

889
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,158
the ufo not richton which is ufo news it

890
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:57,199
was the only ufo newspaper in the world

891
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,838
it came out weekly was about 18 pages

892
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,239
and it had all it was nothing but ufo

893
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:04,880
news and reports around the world so

894
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,719
they soon heard about bob renaud's case

895
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,160
and they invited him to come to germany

896
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,838
and tell him about it send him a ticket

897
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,879
prepaid ticket

898
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,199
he did

899
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,960
took his notes and went to wiesbaden and

900
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,639
met carl and annie white

901
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,119
they talked about his case for several

902
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:22,480
days and the vice became so interested

903
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,640
they wanted to publish his information

904
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
and he finally agreed to let them

905
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,639
publish it only if they wouldn't allow

906
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,559
it to be translated into english and

907
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,400
sent back the united states

908
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,799
so the vice published the notes that he

909
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,519
had and it took three volumes there's

910
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,519
volume one

911
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,000
and here's volume two

912
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,639
it's got a picture of one of the shuttle

913
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,000
craft on that one

914
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,000
and here is volume three

915
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
the slides are out order that looks like

916
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,240
that's volume one anyway

917
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,599
there were three volumes

918
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,519
that uh

919
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,519
were published by ufo not greekton

920
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,199
and uh

921
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,960
it included in those volumes they

922
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,199
included the only pictures that were

923
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,920
ever released

924
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,118
of bob renaud's

925
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
facility

926
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,760
bob renaud was a high school graduate

927
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,960
about 19 years old

928
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,680
turned 20 while this was early going on

929
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,519
he rented a basement room in his parents

930
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,879
home and worked

931
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,800
in a general electric factory in

932
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,079
massachusetts

933
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,880
and

934
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,240
he took his money that he earned in his

935
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,640
job and and collected electronic

936
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:47,598
equipment he became a ham radio buff

937
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:50,719
built his own ham radio set from a kit

938
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,838
and then he proceeded to build himself

939
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,799
a home built television set from a kid

940
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:56,400
also

941
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,560
you see the television set in the left

942
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,720
side of the picture there and his ham

943
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,000
radio is in the front on the little

944
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,838
table

945
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,559
and uh

946
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,159
he he was happy with his communications

947
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,199
gear and his setup and it was doing

948
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,480
serving him well he he uh he was being

949
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,078
fulfilled

950
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,519
by

951
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,440
the efforts that he was putting into it

952
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,358
and he was

953
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,079
there sitting there reading a magazine

954
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,319
one night and he thought he'd tune up

955
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,359
tune in the bbc news broadcast from

956
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,119
london

957
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,799
so he put his magazine down and went

958
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,119
over turned his set on

959
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,240
let it warm up and then tried to tune in

960
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,720
bbc and the closer he got the bbc the

961
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,279
louder noise he got

962
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:44,000
in his uh radio there was a beep beep

963
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,760
beep beep that was quite loud when he

964
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
got on bbc it was so loud he couldn't

965
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,440
really hear bbc so he tuned down to get

966
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,960
away from it

967
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
couldn't hear very good very good that

968
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,039
way either so he turned back up again

969
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,358
and went looking for the meat when he

970
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,838
homed on the beep and got it loud and

971
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:02,719
clear it stopped

972
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,719
and a soft boy said bob stay on this

973
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,919
frequency we want to talk to you we've

974
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:11,039
been trying to contact you for some time

975
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,519
so he was amazed that this was happening

976
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,480
stayed on the frequency

977
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,320
and they told him that if he would

978
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,358
make some adjustments in a shortwave

979
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
radio

980
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,598
he could signal them and they could come

981
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,759
back to him immediately on a better

982
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,079
frequency a clearer frequency which they

983
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,440
set up for it he made the modification

984
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,519
then he had

985
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,358
regular contact between him and the

986
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,599
visitors

987
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,598
so after four or five of these contacts

988
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,519
they told him how to modify

989
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,920
his home built television set to do the

990
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,759
same thing so he could pick up images on

991
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,800
his television set

992
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,359
of them

993
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,240
brought transmitted from their craft

994
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:52,559
and now he had two-way communication he

995
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,879
could sit in front of his television set

996
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,039
a round black and white screen there

997
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,039
and

998
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,400
talk to him on his radio

999
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,320
and see him at the same time and he he

1000
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,200
thought this was great

1001
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,880
and those contacts continued to develop

1002
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,799
and they told him that they would

1003
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,000
eventually talk to him face to face

1004
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,320
here here's the only time that he

1005
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,400
appeared on a convention i'm sorry

1006
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,119
that's another picture of him in his uh

1007
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,960
little basement studio

1008
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,119
and here's a picture of

1009
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,159
buck nelson's convention

1010
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,320
from uh a book where i found that's buck

1011
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,319
nelson in the left side walking into the

1012
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,440
picture it wasn't a very impressive

1013
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,440
convention but it still attracted a few

1014
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,320
people and it attracted the debunkers

1015
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,320
right along with all the rest

1016
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,078
here's another

1017
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,559
issue of gabriel green's

1018
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,039
ufo international now he's calling it

1019
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:54,078
flying saucers international

1020
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,358
and this picture shows the corinthian

1021
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,200
car

1022
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,838
where they picked the

1023
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,679
bob renaud up in front of his house

1024
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,239
and they flew to

1025
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,838
an area not more than eight miles from

1026
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,679
where he lives

1027
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,318
in the berkshire mountains descended

1028
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,919
into a forest clearing

1029
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:12,880
when they got a few yards above the

1030
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,480
ground

1031
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,640
it opened up like you see there

1032
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,318
clamshell doors opened up

1033
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,400
the car went down a shaft the doors

1034
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,079
closed behind it

1035
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,318
and they were in a

1036
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,240
an elaborately excavated underground

1037
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,440
facility that the car traveled down the

1038
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,439
corridors

1039
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,760
carrying the passengers with it

1040
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,920
and they traveled some distance it was a

1041
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,000
quite a large facility they they went

1042
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,000
down several corridors and parked the

1043
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,838
car in a parking garage and got on

1044
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,519
escalator walks sidewalks moving

1045
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:47,199
sidewalks to down some more corridors to

1046
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,719
a welcoming room

1047
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,799
and

1048
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,919
there

1049
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,839
his friends uh presented bob to somebody

1050
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,159
at a reception desk and

1051
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,078
and they prepared a pass for him to be

1052
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,118
used a plastic pass

1053
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,119
that had

1054
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,200
some coded signals in it

1055
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,519
and this they gave him this pass so he

1056
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,078
could use it to get into the facility by

1057
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,960
himself if he ever needed to or was told

1058
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,960
to or wanted to

1059
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:16,960
the

1060
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,200
next issue

1061
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,480
of the flying saucers international

1062
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,639
showed

1063
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,719
the first man to walk in space

1064
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,000
this guy walked in space

1065
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,159
on a

1066
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,119
corinthian craft in a corinthian space

1067
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,960
suit

1068
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,960
eight months before

1069
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,000
our first american astronaut

1070
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,400
made an extra vehicular

1071
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,159
exit from our spacecraft

1072
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,559
so we gave a lot of credit to our first

1073
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,559
man to walk in space but he's really not

1074
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,358
the first one to be out there

1075
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,679
outside the craft and

1076
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:53,440
it was bobbering out

1077
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,118
here is a little more detail

1078
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,159
on the

1079
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,119
the spacesuit that they provided him

1080
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,879
it

1081
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,440
was not a highly pressurized suit

1082
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,519
but it contained an atmosphere or his

1083
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,280
earth atmosphere in it

1084
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,318
it had control buttons on the breast

1085
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,200
there

1086
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:15,599
it had magnetic boots that

1087
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,719
stuck to the surface of the spacecraft

1088
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,800
they were in

1089
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,719
when he tilted his angle ankle at a

1090
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,880
certain angle it would release the

1091
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,799
magnetism and he could lift the boot

1092
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,640
when he put it down again it would stay

1093
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,839
fast until he dipped his ankle a certain

1094
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,838
way

1095
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:33,039
and

1096
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:35,039
there's also a diagram there

1097
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,279
of the spacecraft the inside of the

1098
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:41,759
spacecraft that took him

1099
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,760
out into space for that walk-in space

1100
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,559
and

1101
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,400
we'll come back to that diagram a little

1102
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,480
later this cut that particular scotch

1103
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,680
craft i believe was about 60 feet in

1104
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,119
diameter

1105
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,480
if i remember correctly but we get

1106
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,000
another diagram

1107
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,119
of it

1108
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,639
this next one shows

1109
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,680
a as an artist

1110
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:04,318
rendition of bob renaud's departure from

1111
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,318
his driveway and that little remote

1112
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,159
controlled domed disc that carries only

1113
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,639
one or two people that i showed you

1114
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,318
aboard another craft here it's

1115
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,679
approaching the care

1116
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,239
carrier craft

1117
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,559
and you see the iris port that opened as

1118
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,479
it got closer and it went in that iris

1119
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,279
board inside

1120
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,838
into the hangar and bob got out and met

1121
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,480
his his friends

1122
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,480
there

1123
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,000
now this is

1124
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,599
a picture

1125
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,400
a photograph

1126
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,318
of the area where they parked the car

1127
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,720
now the first time

1128
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,880
for the first face-to-face meeting he

1129
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,959
got his signal on his ham radio told him

1130
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,240
to be out in front of his house at four

1131
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,838
o'clock sharp

1132
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:47,279
so we went out there about five minutes

1133
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,078
early and

1134
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,000
almost right on the dot headlights came

1135
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,440
around the corner in the distance this

1136
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,318
is dark at night

1137
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,599
it was cold morning in the winter time

1138
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,800
and a plymouth convertible turned the

1139
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,280
corner

1140
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,039
with one man in it he pulled up stopped

1141
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,119
and opened the door

1142
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,679
to let bob in when he when he got in the

1143
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,119
convertible he saw that it was a man

1144
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,919
that he worked with

1145
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,480
in the general electric plant

1146
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,559
near in a town near his home there

1147
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,199
and this man had

1148
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,279
attempted to engage bob in

1149
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,879
discussions of ufos several times and

1150
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,839
bob wasn't really interested in the

1151
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,680
subject but he sat and listened and

1152
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,078
he didn't pay much attention to the guy

1153
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,639
until now he's driving the car

1154
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,599
at the rendezvous time he got in the car

1155
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:40,318
with him and he drove out of the out of

1156
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,480
town and into a wooded area where

1157
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,079
they came on this other

1158
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,240
car that was that ported here from

1159
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,119
corondor they parked the plymouth in the

1160
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,519
trees right back in out of sight there

1161
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,920
got in the corinthian car and went to

1162
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,400
the underground base for the first visit

1163
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,240
at the underground base

1164
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,039
here's another

1165
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,719
pickup point this time he was picked up

1166
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,599
and taken to

1167
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,519
this place in the in the corinthian car

1168
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,559
they left the corinthian car and got

1169
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,800
into a

1170
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,799
larger craft and went elsewhere

1171
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,880
this is a diagram

1172
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:25,358
of

1173
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,358
a the 60-foot diameter spacecraft

1174
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,639
these are unmanned disks here that are

1175
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,199
used for

1176
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:36,318
remote control observations

1177
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,318
aboard the craft and

1178
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:42,079
this little disc here

1179
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,720
are more remote monitors

1180
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,960
like these that they launch and control

1181
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,639
from the control panel inside here and

1182
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,559
they do all kinds of

1183
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,879
surveillance and observational work with

1184
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,358
these monitored disks that are

1185
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,358
very sophisticated can do a lot of

1186
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,358
things

1187
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,560
here's a diagram

1188
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,119
of a larger craft this craft is 155 feet

1189
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:14,799
in diameter

1190
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,160
and here we see some bigger discs

1191
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,760
that

1192
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,519
are about the size of the other disc we

1193
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,599
just looked at that carry monitors the

1194
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,800
bigger discs are launched and recovered

1195
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,039
from this

1196
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,560
150 foot diameter

1197
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:32,159
disc craft disc shaped craft that

1198
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,960
carried a crew of about 60 people

1199
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,960
i borrowed that one

1200
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,318
now there's uh

1201
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,879
all kinds of facilities here the latrine

1202
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,318
facilities the dining facilities

1203
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,880
everything's all

1204
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,119
illustrated in here and it's in

1205
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,680
the book that i've published in ebook

1206
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,838
format all everything you see here

1207
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,279
is published in ebook format

1208
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:56,880
and you can bring it up on your screen

1209
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,119
make it as big as you want to read the

1210
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,559
letters it's a lot larger you like you

1211
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,400
look at the details

1212
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,400
and the shape of its construction there

1213
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,960
this next one is a much bigger craft

1214
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,800
this craft i believe is on the order of

1215
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,559
250 to

1216
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,280
sphere

1217
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,400
about 250 feet in diameter i believe let

1218
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,839
me

1219
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,838
get back here to my

1220
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,480
my notes

1221
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,479
see if i can find the details i had

1222
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,839
on it

1223
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,200
i'd like to give you

1224
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,920
the uh

1225
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,960
well i should have been turning these

1226
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,639
carefully as i went but uh now i believe

1227
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,318
i'm getting back to where

1228
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,558
i want to be

1229
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:02,558
uh

1230
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,599
that's the 155

1231
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,480
before that was 155 foot diameter here

1232
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,039
we are

1233
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,639
the 400 foot diameter

1234
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,679
alliance

1235
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:20,159
craft spc-12 is what they called it i

1236
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,679
don't know what that means

1237
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,920
bob was given

1238
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,679
printed guidebooks

1239
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,920
for this ship so he could tell where he

1240
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,759
was and find his way around

1241
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,358
which he was allowed to keep the

1242
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,640
guidebooks were printed in corinthian

1243
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,119
but by now

1244
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,078
they have taught him to read corinthian

1245
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,760
script

1246
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,960
and he found an interesting thing he

1247
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,200
found that when he was in the

1248
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,960
underground base in massachusetts

1249
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:44,399
that all the signs in the underground

1250
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,199
base were lettered in english and he

1251
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,280
asked

1252
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,838
or evolve his escort

1253
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,640
why the english signs he said well we're

1254
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,799
in an english-speaking country and all

1255
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,920
of our employees here all of the people

1256
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,160
that work here

1257
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,519
are trained in english and they go out

1258
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,759
and come back

1259
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,599
and they need to know the language and

1260
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,760
so this is just to

1261
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,838
keep it all current they said that that

1262
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,720
they learned our languages a long time

1263
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,039
ago

1264
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,318
with shortly it took them like two weeks

1265
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,400
to learn the first language and they

1266
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,800
chose english because that seemed to be

1267
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,720
spoken more prominently

1268
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,880
in what appeared to be the country with

1269
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:24,000
the most advanced technical

1270
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,000
information available

1271
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,039
right we lost the slide again that

1272
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,400
machine back there is not doing too well

1273
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,639
there's a picture of

1274
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,760
orival's space car

1275
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,400
on the top

1276
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,640
i've lost part of it in the screen here

1277
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,480
and this is the garments that they wear

1278
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,598
in the underground base facility and

1279
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,400
also

1280
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,318
in

1281
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,440
the the disc shaped craft when they come

1282
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,119
to visit

1283
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,039
uh they

1284
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,480
they're earth style garments but they

1285
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,119
this is not what they wear when they

1286
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,960
come out and mix in society they wear

1287
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,838
clothes that they bought in clothing

1288
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,679
stores just like we wear but this is a

1289
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:04,639
comfortable kind of a uniform that they

1290
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,239
wear

1291
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:12,719
in their corindian base facilities

1292
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:15,439
and there's a man here's a woman

1293
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,439
if you didn't know it

1294
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,879
this is the diagram

1295
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,720
of the alliance of planets

1296
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,640
let me get my

1297
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,959
i got a lot of papers up here i

1298
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,358
have to keep shuffling to keep up with

1299
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,199
where we are there we go

1300
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:36,159
a diagram of the alliance of planets

1301
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,960
the top division there

1302
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,960
the alliance

1303
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:45,280
was formed with 150 planets

1304
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,159
joined in a dream that had been

1305
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,000
been

1306
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,399
flourishing for centuries the name has

1307
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,800
long since been called the united

1308
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,559
world's alliance but the great visions

1309
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,720
of our founders are as fresh today as

1310
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,519
they were in that hallowed place where

1311
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:02,000
they were farmed 650 years ago of your

1312
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:04,318
time which has become a shrine that

1313
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,119
every alliance citizen tries to visit at

1314
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:10,159
least once in his lifetime

1315
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,440
earlier i stated this is a

1316
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,879
corinthian addressing uh

1317
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,280
bob reloud

1318
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,880
earlier i stated that the present count

1319
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:24,160
of the alliance worlds was about 740

1320
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,800
000. although that is the full number of

1321
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:29,039
the uaws it is now split into two in the

1322
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,800
five major divisions

1323
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:34,318
of which corn doors has about

1324
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,839
143 000

1325
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:39,119
planets it's one of 143 000 planets in

1326
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,039
its division

1327
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,599
of the alliance of planets

1328
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,639
this segmenting was made necessary by

1329
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,800
the sheer

1330
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:50,879
enormity of the task of attempting to

1331
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,760
govern so many worlds under one roof the

1332
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,240
process of partitioning took place over

1333
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,599
a period of four years and was ended

1334
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,519
about

1335
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,440
september 19th of

1336
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:05,679
1986 of your time the system of

1337
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,119
government that i will now outline came

1338
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:11,039
out of that conclave carried out

1339
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:14,240
at this of this mammoth operation at

1340
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:16,558
that time the council of elders

1341
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,239
the top line on the chart there

1342
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,079
the council of elders is still the

1343
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,598
official ruling body of the full

1344
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,200
alliance now

1345
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,720
this is not

1346
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,358
ruled by edict

1347
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:30,159
it's ruled by

1348
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,318
recommendation a council

1349
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,239
deliberates on problems and makes

1350
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,318
recommendations and they either follow

1351
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,838
it or they don't but

1352
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:39,679
they usually follow it because that's

1353
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:43,199
usually the best course of action the

1354
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,598
council is made up of the wisest men

1355
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,919
in their society and each

1356
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,559
unit of the society picks the wisest men

1357
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,519
they have to participate in the levels

1358
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,720
going up to the senior councils

1359
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,079
they're kind of a government but it's

1360
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,399
not elective

1361
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:02,800
and it's not addictive

1362
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,800
it isn't it doesn't issue mandates

1363
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,880
there are five sub-councils that handle

1364
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,838
the matters within their respective

1365
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,559
divisions in turn these are subdivided

1366
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:15,279
into sector councils that each control

1367
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,040
about ten 000 planets in a specific

1368
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,359
region of space

1369
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,119
these are given

1370
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:23,119
these are again segmented into

1371
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,119
sub-sectors the lowest level of the

1372
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,800
official alliance hierarchy

1373
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,960
each of them handles the affairs of

1374
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:33,200
about 100 worlds

1375
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:35,599
in space close facial proximity

1376
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:39,439
this basic diagram illustrates the new

1377
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,920
format it was adopted in 1988

1378
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,880
so the council masters up there has five

1379
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,119
divisions of 143 000 each

1380
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,318
the sub-council down here

1381
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,200
of masters also has five

1382
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,679
sub-councils

1383
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,879
within their divisions and the sector

1384
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,519
council

1385
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,680
has about 10 000 planets in each

1386
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:03,199
specific sector

1387
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:06,639
and those are subdivided into

1388
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,639
groups of 100 worlds

1389
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,960
and these are rule the masters that

1390
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,559
we're talking about are the wisest

1391
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,440
people that they have in our society

1392
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,880
they're they're they're spiritual people

1393
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,200
they uh

1394
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,960
they achieve mastership by knowing more

1395
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,719
than anybody else

1396
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,480
and because they're all telepathic this

1397
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,439
is easily recognized

1398
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,920
and so

1399
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,440
when a recommendation is made by

1400
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,639
a senior master it usually is followed

1401
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,159
because

1402
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,078
it's the best course of action that

1403
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:38,078
could be decided anyway

1404
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,798
and will result in the we'll get the

1405
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,798
best result

1406
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,598
so now where is exactly where is

1407
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,440
corondor

1408
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,400
this is arcturus

1409
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,639
and about two fingerlings finger width

1410
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,880
north northeast of our tourists as you

1411
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,118
look at it in the night sky

1412
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,519
right in there someplace at the head of

1413
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,920
the arrow is a star that you can just

1414
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,838
barely see it's it's the finest

1415
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,440
magnitude on the star charts it's just a

1416
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,838
tiny little dot

1417
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,079
and that's their son korrina we don't

1418
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:11,679
even number it on our charts

1419
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,798
it's uh

1420
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,679
and their son has several planets they

1421
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:17,199
come

1422
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,318
corinthians come from the third planet

1423
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,960
we'll go into that a little bit more

1424
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:23,279
later but there's the star chart from

1425
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,798
the start the big star chart

1426
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,440
astronomical star chart used by

1427
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:27,440
astronomers

1428
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,558
so the next thing we have here is

1429
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,239
probably going to be difficult for you

1430
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,040
to read is

1431
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:42,000
a list of corinthian scientists

1432
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:44,239
that have been working

1433
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,358
in one relationship or another with bob

1434
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:49,078
renaud

1435
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,078
he's met them all

1436
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,960
and they represent for instance just

1437
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:54,719
just

1438
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,559
to give you some idea

1439
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:00,399
vern farrell the top one works in

1440
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:03,040
anthropodia anthropodynamics

1441
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,039
the other two all do also

1442
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:07,599
john lahr the fourth one down works in

1443
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,000
chemistry and the next one does

1444
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,480
jerry saul the electronics engineer

1445
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,679
helped bob renaud do some

1446
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,039
modifications on his equipment

1447
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,798
vero pollen

1448
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,880
under that is a genetical biologist

1449
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,159
olly soren after that is a genetical

1450
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,000
biologist sencore is a linguist

1451
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:30,399
they can learn languages in about two

1452
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,119
weeks any language

1453
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,960
orival is a mathematician he was the

1454
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,039
principal contact with bob bernard

1455
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,559
orival is the one that picked him up and

1456
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,279
escorted him around the various

1457
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,760
facilities they took him to see

1458
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,760
but he was a mathematician

1459
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,440
leonary down in the

1460
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,440
lower middle

1461
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,240
is a psychologist she was the first

1462
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,318
voice that contacted him over the radio

1463
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,159
and he maintained a constant contact

1464
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:00,079
with linare whenever he was being

1465
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:03,920
escorted around the corinthian

1466
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:06,160
facilities she accompanied orival and

1467
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,760
together they showed him around they

1468
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,000
introduced him to people

1469
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,920
they demonstrated things for him

1470
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,400
in their parent in their corinthian

1471
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,119
society and their base facilities here

1472
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,358
on this planet

1473
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:22,079
below the break and the names there is

1474
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,598
han kim a sociologist

1475
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,960
before or below him or also a

1476
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,039
sociologist

1477
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:32,400
below them the last four names are

1478
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:34,000
airy lawn is a teratologist

1479
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,240
and the rest are the other four are

1480
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,838
teratologists tarantologists are

1481
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:43,759
scientists that study

1482
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:43,759
earth the particular studies of earth

1483
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:46,798
this next chart

1484
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,679
which you can't probably can't read

1485
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:49,119
either

1486
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:52,078
is the crew

1487
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:54,640
of the spc-12 which is the big 400 foot

1488
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,599
diameter sphere that he was shown about

1489
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,480
given a

1490
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,920
a

1491
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,798
manual

1492
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,720
guide in corinthian language how to get

1493
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:05,838
around there they let him keep the guide

1494
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,439
by the way he still has it

1495
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,759
and the crew

1496
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,798
was made up of

1497
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,880
the top one is an analyst esther laurie

1498
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,719
then the captain alaina eldrani met him

1499
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,920
several times as a co-captain he only

1500
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,000
met once

1501
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,798
communications officer ken roy helped

1502
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,719
him do some work on his gear also

1503
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,759
there were console operators three of

1504
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,719
them

1505
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,640
uh

1506
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,199
another in three engineers a flight

1507
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:35,199
engineer more mathematicians and

1508
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,798
an astrological officer a navigator

1509
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:39,279
the last group

1510
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:42,079
is masters

1511
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,240
in the governmental hierarchy the

1512
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,559
masters that he met

1513
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:48,879
at one time or another

1514
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,559
in the upper case letters are the elder

1515
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,960
masters

1516
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,640
and lowercase let

1517
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,798
letters are just masters the elder

1518
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:01,199
masters are elected by

1519
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:03,280
the conclave of masters because of their

1520
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:04,798
they they rise to a level of superior

1521
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,839
knowledge

1522
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:08,798
and there are not very many of them

1523
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:11,039
now the

1524
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,318
to give you an idea what the masters are

1525
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,159
and what they do they all have

1526
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:15,440
specializations also that first one on

1527
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,519
the top there

1528
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,720
is krenlor

1529
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,880
he's from arcturia arcturia

1530
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,358
is one it's a headquarters planet for

1531
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,318
the alliance many records are kept there

1532
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:27,598
and he

1533
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:29,119
frequently met

1534
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,079
grenoir

1535
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,079
akinvesta

1536
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,760
had primary responsibility for the earth

1537
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,399
operations going on here by the

1538
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,400
corinthians

1539
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,480
then there was more from corinthian

1540
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,480
corridor

1541
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,599
okay

1542
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:53,440
here's

1543
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,760
the last group our miscellaneous

1544
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,798
personality met along the way

1545
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,960
and

1546
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:01,599
just to characterize them a little bit

1547
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,960
there was the first one artadoric was a

1548
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,960
replacement

1549
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,880
for all this is interesting art and

1550
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,519
doric

1551
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,880
a time came when they wanted to take bob

1552
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:12,480
to view

1553
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,960
something that was going to take more

1554
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,679
than one day which

1555
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,679
means he's gonna have to get a vacation

1556
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:22,558
from his job or maybe lose it

1557
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:25,039
his parents who he's carefully kept

1558
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,640
his contacts from his parents because he

1559
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,719
knew that they would be highly disturbed

1560
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:31,440
that they knew what he was doing between

1561
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:33,279
the hours of midnight and morning

1562
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,519
so he never told them

1563
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,599
he had a pet dog slept on his on his bed

1564
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,440
put in his bed

1565
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,960
and he

1566
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,400
he didn't have time to tell his

1567
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,440
employers

1568
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,280
so

1569
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,440
for that pickup they brought the

1570
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,359
corinthians brought another man

1571
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,240
with him and introduced him to bob but

1572
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:54,798
he looked just like bob like a twin

1573
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:57,199
and they said this is art to doric he

1574
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:59,199
will replace you while we're gone he has

1575
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,960
been carefully prepared

1576
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:02,879
to

1577
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,240
use your habits and mannerisms speaking

1578
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,920
with your voice

1579
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:09,759
and work your job at the at the general

1580
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,440
electric plant nobody will know the

1581
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,319
difference

1582
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,480
and they left artadoric he was dressed

1583
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:17,440
in the same kind of clothes that bob was

1584
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,119
wearing

1585
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,000
and he went into the house into bob's

1586
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,039
basement room and went to bed bob went

1587
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,519
with

1588
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:27,199
orival and the rest of the team on the

1589
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,440
mission they were taking him on at the

1590
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:29,439
time

1591
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:37,319
i don't see any other particular

1592
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,318
names of interest there

1593
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,759
there here's one

1594
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,358
there in sin was a venusian

1595
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,960
working with the corinthians that they

1596
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,440
had picked up

1597
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:53,639
who was from a venusian mission on the

1598
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,639
moon that was observing earth

1599
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,318
now

1600
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,719
they showed

1601
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,480
bob their language and and gave him a

1602
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,879
language course when he learned to speak

1603
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,400
current and read corinthian

1604
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:11,200
and i'll i've got

1605
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,680
some symbols here to show you here's uh

1606
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,598
what the korean language

1607
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,558
looked like these are punctuation

1608
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,640
symbols the third column over right

1609
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,160
right about here those are corinthian

1610
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,000
punctuation marks

1611
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,440
and their equivalents

1612
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
are

1613
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,079
shown out here in this column

1614
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,519
the first one for example example is a

1615
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,400
period

1616
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:36,559
and the second one is a comma

1617
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,599
the third one is a hyphen

1618
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:42,559
the fourth one is a colon and so forth

1619
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,280
but they had a very well

1620
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,359
developed language system as as well

1621
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,079
developed as english or any of the other

1622
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,838
earth languages and in some instances it

1623
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,640
was even more developed and conveyed

1624
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:54,960
more

1625
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:58,078
knowledge in the words than we

1626
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,079
than we know and use

1627
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,318
here's another page on the

1628
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,559
korean language all of this by the way

1629
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,838
is in the little mini cd

1630
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,280
where you can bring them up and look at

1631
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:10,480
them in great detail later if you're

1632
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,039
interested

1633
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,880
these show

1634
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,400
a sentence

1635
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,680
right here written in corinthian

1636
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,039
language

1637
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:21,440
which says

1638
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,359
it's a phrase that was frequently used

1639
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,159
as they were departing they'd say

1640
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,159
loose enos

1641
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,400
and that meant

1642
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,400
go in the light and until next we meet

1643
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,400
and this shows uh

1644
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:43,119
corinthian symbols

1645
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:46,880
and these are galinguan symbols now the

1646
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,000
linguists corinthian linguists explained

1647
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,079
that

1648
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,440
in the alliance of worlds the hundreds

1649
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,079
even thousands of

1650
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,318
worlds in the alliance

1651
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,400
in this particular sector of space there

1652
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:01,119
are two major

1653
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,358
interplanetary languages

1654
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:06,160
one is galinguan

1655
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:06,159
and the other is

1656
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,318
is uh

1657
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:14,960
oh boy forgot it england and solex mall

1658
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:17,038
solix mall was the language system that

1659
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,960
was described by george hunt williamson

1660
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,240
in his books uh other tongues other

1661
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,000
flesh

1662
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,759
he never mentioned anything yes he did

1663
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,480
mention galinguan in his book too but he

1664
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,480
didn't explain anything on it this

1665
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,720
the corinthians explained that the

1666
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:37,599
korean language language was derived

1667
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:40,078
from galinguan and that in

1668
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,160
the foundation of languages that

1669
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,359
these two major language

1670
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:46,078
systems

1671
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:48,400
have many derivatives it's like

1672
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,880
on earth many languages are derived from

1673
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,240
latin one might say that latin

1674
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,880
was a base language for earth languages

1675
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:59,199
and in that same sense galinguan was a

1676
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,039
base language for many planetary

1677
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,759
languages within the

1678
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:06,880
the alliance of planet system

1679
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,720
and solex mal was the basic language of

1680
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,358
another federation of planets in the

1681
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,279
system there incidentally where it was a

1682
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,119
parallel group

1683
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,160
parallel to the alliance of planets that

1684
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,079
had

1685
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,000
roughly the same number

1686
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,039
of planets and they're intermixed with

1687
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,639
the alliance planets and they cut their

1688
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:29,200
allied in what they call a

1689
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:32,639
there's the

1690
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,639
alliance of planets and the

1691
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:38,480
superman

1692
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,480
uh

1693
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,960
alliance and

1694
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,639
confederation of planets the

1695
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,720
confederation of planets is something

1696
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,000
like the alliance of planets

1697
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,318
that

1698
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,440
does have the same kind of a governing

1699
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:52,960
system

1700
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,920
and similarly but

1701
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,400
the

1702
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,559
confederation of planets uses another

1703
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,280
base language system

1704
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,760
than galinguan i don't have anything on

1705
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,079
that here but those two are present all

1706
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,760
over our neighboring our sector of the

1707
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,760
galaxy gail england

1708
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,000
the other one and solix mall

1709
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,239
so

1710
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,599
when i was studying the

1711
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,239
languages there i should have had that

1712
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,920
up i was talking about it

1713
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,719
here is uh

1714
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,639
while i was doing this

1715
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:38,000
i discovered another book that was

1716
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:40,400
written about bob renaud apart from

1717
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,559
what gabriel greene was publishing

1718
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,400
and this was a book that was written by

1719
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,599
john dean

1720
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,599
who wrote

1721
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:51,920
he was pretty well known for his

1722
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,519
authorship of flying saucers and the

1723
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,119
scriptures a book that he had written

1724
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,440
before this

1725
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,920
and john w dean

1726
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,079
hearing of bob's renowned contacts made

1727
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,400
direct contact with him and began a long

1728
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,480
correspondence with bob about the

1729
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,160
context with the corinthians

1730
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,318
and their intentions

1731
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,078
this was welcomed by bob as one of the

1732
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,358
few with whom

1733
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,680
serious interest

1734
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:16,960
in with serious and interesting

1735
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:19,440
intentions about

1736
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,519
his spectacular case and a regular and

1737
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,159
frequent communication developed between

1738
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:26,000
bob and john dean

1739
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:27,519
john asked many questions got many

1740
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,798
answers

1741
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:30,880
including a description of the

1742
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,599
corinthian language and a table of other

1743
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:36,798
stars with planets in our vicinity of

1744
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,240
our milky way this part we

1745
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:41,519
will share some of the profound

1746
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:44,239
information revealed by to bob renaud

1747
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,719
for john dean at john dean's request by

1748
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:49,038
the corinthians themselves as originally

1749
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:51,838
published in john dean's book flying

1750
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,920
saucers close-up

1751
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:56,558
and here is that book for those of you

1752
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,599
that have a copy of it

1753
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,280
well

1754
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,798
i don't see the

1755
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,640
title on the top

1756
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:04,480
i don't know why we don't have that let

1757
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,318
me back up

1758
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,559
that should have had flying sausage

1759
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:09,920
close-up by john w dean that little

1760
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,720
picture was in the middle of the page

1761
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,440
and this is amazing because the slide

1762
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,278
was photographed from this page

1763
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,640
and you see we've lost all the writing

1764
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,040
on the slide and tell me how that could

1765
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,039
be done

1766
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,520
gremlins yeah

1767
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,519
so john dean

1768
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,520
asked a lot of questions

1769
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,319
he was

1770
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:44,560
very interested in

1771
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,480
details that gabriel greene didn't get

1772
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,239
about for for example about the first

1773
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,039
moon trip

1774
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,559
and

1775
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,798
bob had

1776
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,400
pretty much terminated his

1777
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,000
furnishing of information to gabriel

1778
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,679
green by the time he took the first trip

1779
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,079
to the moon

1780
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,399
and this is a scene painted by

1781
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,880
a staff artist for the

1782
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,479
flagship close-up book you just the

1783
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,960
cover i tried to show you

1784
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:12,479
and this shows

1785
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:15,039
bob renaud and a woman from the control

1786
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,079
center at on the moon astra laurie

1787
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:17,920
riding

1788
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:19,359
moon scooters you notice they're

1789
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,039
wheelers

1790
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:24,079
and they're in

1791
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:26,319
low gravity or low pressure suits

1792
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:26,318
for

1793
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,079
traveling around on the surface of the

1794
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:32,158
moon shows the

1795
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,439
earth there painted into the scene in

1796
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,719
the

1797
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:36,719
in its proper perspective

1798
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,880
so here now then is the book

1799
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:42,479
flying saucers and the scriptures

1800
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,319
published by john

1801
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,639
dean some of you may even have that book

1802
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,120
in your in your collections

1803
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,798
it's not a very big book but it was a

1804
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:52,719
discussion of

1805
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,479
the biblical

1806
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,079
reports

1807
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:59,039
of contacts with

1808
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,880
extraterrestrial beings and an analysis

1809
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,039
of them and an attempt to explain them

1810
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,560
by john dean

1811
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:06,560
before these contacts began

1812
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,880
now john dean

1813
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:14,559
asking about the

1814
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,960
language was the one that

1815
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,480
that persuaded bob to get the

1816
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,840
description of the language and the

1817
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:22,238
language

1818
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,920
uh presentations there was a lot more to

1819
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:25,599
it by the way just those three pages

1820
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,880
only showed the punctuation

1821
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,079
and a phrase

1822
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,440
but he got a a system of description of

1823
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:33,439
the language and how to speak

1824
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,679
vocabulary words also and how to

1825
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,960
phrase make phrases

1826
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,039
so

1827
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,520
not satisfied with that much john dean

1828
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:45,760
started pressuring bob

1829
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,640
get a list of the inhabited planets in

1830
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,520
our

1831
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,800
near

1832
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,120
space

1833
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,480
so bob asked the corinthians to what

1834
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:53,760
they could do

1835
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:56,479
they said they would get their

1836
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,640
scientists their astronomers to prepare

1837
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:01,439
such a list

1838
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,880
and john dean was writing his

1839
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,559
book

1840
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,480
that you just saw flying saucers close

1841
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,640
up with a large section on bob renaud

1842
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:13,399
and the publisher was pushing him now

1843
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,400
to get the rest of his information in

1844
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,800
and he still had not received

1845
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:21,119
the list of planets

1846
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,440
that he'd asked for and he was delaying

1847
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:25,519
the printing until he could get the list

1848
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:27,839
he was pushing bob to get it

1849
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,159
baba's trying to hustle the corinthians

1850
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,560
to get the list to john dean and

1851
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:33,519
and he gave john gave them john dean's

1852
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,520
address

1853
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,920
and when the corinthians

1854
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,120
prepared the list to transmit it

1855
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,440
instead of

1856
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:43,519
delivering it to bob to be delivered to

1857
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:46,399
john dean they're trying to speed it up

1858
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,960
by sending an emissary from the

1859
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:51,519
earth base in massachusetts with the

1860
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,480
list to go out and mail it to john dean

1861
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,080
directly which they did and the package

1862
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:58,399
arrived john dean looked and he thought

1863
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,760
gee this is just what i look for what i

1864
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:00,879
asked for

1865
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,880
and i

1866
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,600
i'll send it right off to the publisher

1867
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:09,719
i don't have time to do anything with it

1868
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,719
so that's what went to the publisher

1869
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,599
so the list

1870
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,600
included

1871
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,719
and this is the beginning of

1872
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,960
that chapter on the other planets in

1873
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:27,279
john dean's book

1874
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,560
and i'll read the prelude here because

1875
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:31,840
it's kind of important the list will

1876
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,679
include those planets among the 75

1877
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,079
brightest stars known to earth

1878
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,840
astronomers

1879
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:40,079
the listings will be as follows the

1880
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,520
star's astronomical destination

1881
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,479
designation

1882
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:48,239
as used by astronomers such as gamma

1883
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:51,279
booties its common name is used by the

1884
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:54,000
alliance in this chart which is nearly

1885
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:57,279
always the the word used by the

1886
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,679
inhabitants if any of its planets it's

1887
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,279
the last register number it's this is

1888
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:03,359
from us in light years from earth and

1889
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,479
light years that is accurate to within

1890
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:06,719
one light year

1891
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:09,439
and further data on these stars may be

1892
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:12,000
found in any comprehensive astronomy

1893
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:14,479
textbook or book of tables

1894
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,319
so these stars the 75 stars are all

1895
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:17,678
listed in our astronomy books and

1896
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,840
they're all bright enough to be seen

1897
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:21,520
with the naked eye

1898
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,199
the planets will be listed in their

1899
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,679
orbital order

1900
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:27,439
from the innermost planet out

1901
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,600
and the names will be

1902
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,399
those used by the inhabitants if any

1903
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,480
otherwise names used commonly

1904
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:35,599
by the alliance to designate them will

1905
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:37,678
be

1906
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,039
shown

1907
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,760
inhabitation codes include

1908
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:46,158
uninhabited

1909
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:48,560
col colonized ind indigenous population

1910
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:51,359
in billions of inhabitants

1911
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,800
length of day and hours to one tenth

1912
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:57,279
that's in earth hours diameter and miles

1913
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,239
length of years in earth years

1914
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:00,800
and the

1915
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:04,079
allegiance whether it's an alliance

1916
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,640
planet or a confederation planet

1917
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,238
and there's a third federation here it's

1918
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,320
a calaran federation that is in

1919
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,559
opposition to the first two

1920
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,039
and they don't allow anything to be

1921
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,840
released to the alliance and the

1922
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:21,679
and confederation planets so the the

1923
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:24,000
calran empire is quite different and we

1924
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:25,679
we find them in opposition to

1925
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,760
both the alliance and the confederation

1926
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,239
and they will turn up in later on as we

1927
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,239
go here

1928
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,239
this is not to be considered a

1929
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,919
comprehensive list of planets of the

1930
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:37,678
alliance but rather

1931
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,800
intended to acquaint the readers with

1932
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:42,880
only those nearby stars easily visible

1933
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,239
without telescopes

1934
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,239
now the first one is

1935
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:50,639
alpha conus majoris

1936
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:53,920
which is serious that's this

1937
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,920
group right here there's the name

1938
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,560
it's uh

1939
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:05,360
eight light years distant from us 8.8

1940
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:08,079
light years distance from us

1941
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,319
the first one on the list their periton

1942
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,679
is colonized

1943
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:15,599
uh its population is 42 hundredths of a

1944
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,440
million that's probably four million two

1945
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,640
hundred thousand

1946
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:24,079
the length of the day is 27 hours and

1947
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,760
not 27 to 9 10 hours of earth time the

1948
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:27,399
diameter of the planet

1949
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,400
is

1950
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:34,079
5.709 million miles

1951
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:35,759
its comparative year is 64

1952
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:37,439
of our year

1953
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,199
and it belongs to the alliance of

1954
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,479
planets

1955
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,279
the second one down here

1956
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,799
is

1957
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,960
wooden

1958
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:50,159
it's colonized

1959
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:53,480
its population of billions is 1.6

1960
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:55,519
billion people the length of the day is

1961
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:57,359
19.3 hours

1962
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,440
the diameter is 6

1963
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:02,880
320 miles

1964
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:05,039
its comparative year length is 1.94

1965
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,520
almost two of our years

1966
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:09,039
and it belongs to the omegan

1967
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,719
confederation now the omegan

1968
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:13,198
configuration is going to come up again

1969
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:16,880
a little bit later

1970
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:18,879
it's the omegan headquarters by the way

1971
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,000
then the next one

1972
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:24,800
below that does not have an indigenous

1973
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,279
does not is not populated

1974
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,600
and doesn't have any indeed it is

1975
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:31,679
populated but only with indigenous and

1976
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:35,039
indigenous population that hasn't looked

1977
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,359
out from its planet yet is still

1978
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,039
stuck on the planet

1979
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,319
and the next one below that also is

1980
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,560
inhabited

1981
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,639
but the inhabitants

1982
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,360
its indigenous habits not colonized by

1983
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,800
either the alliance or the confederation

1984
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:50,799
and doesn't belong to the omega the

1985
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,119
third one also

1986
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,239
then the fourth one vector well it's

1987
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,800
about this

1988
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:58,639
sixth and seventh vector and

1989
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,960
right now we get

1990
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,880
there right in there

1991
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,520
are two planets

1992
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,960
that are both colonized

1993
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,400
the first one

1994
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,319
has a population of 1.96

1995
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:14,359
billion

1996
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,559
its length of day is

1997
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:20,599
31.5 hours

1998
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,600
the diameter is 2.88

1999
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,920
2 80 miles

2000
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:29,600
comparative length of year is

2001
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:31,279
7.45 of our years

2002
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,480
and it belongs to the confederation of

2003
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:36,079
planets the up the other besides the

2004
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,678
alliance in our area

2005
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:40,399
and the one below it also belongs to the

2006
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,399
confederation

2007
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,840
the

2008
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,920
next one is uh

2009
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,759
in syria just a few comments we're not

2010
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:00,238
going to do all of these but i'm just

2011
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:02,159
going to show some examples here

2012
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:04,079
serious by the way this

2013
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:06,000
let me back up to it

2014
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,439
chart we had here this this is serious

2015
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,679
here

2016
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:14,879
and it has 12 planets on the list there

2017
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,880
nine are occupied

2018
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:19,920
and keldan the one uh the third one down

2019
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,000
as i said before

2020
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,760
is the omegan headquarters

2021
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,198
the omegans are

2022
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,840
apart from the alliance and the

2023
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:27,839
confederation

2024
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:33,359
the first one of sirius

2025
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,279
is the brightest star in the northern

2026
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:37,599
sky

2027
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,479
peritum

2028
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:43,679
the top one right there

2029
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:45,279
has a population of forty

2030
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,600
forty two hundredths of a million that's

2031
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:49,439
four million two hundred thousand it's a

2032
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,480
research planet for high temperature

2033
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,359
equipment

2034
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:53,359
among other things

2035
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,760
there's another one

2036
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:59,920
of import here it's damat

2037
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,520
which is the fourth one down

2038
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:05,119
right there

2039
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,840
and damat has a population of 4.9

2040
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:09,359
billion

2041
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:12,000
population it's the fourth

2042
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:13,839
planet out from the sun

2043
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,119
and it's a major military system for the

2044
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,119
alliance for the alliance

2045
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,840
and the rest go on from there

2046
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,600
so we won't go there's

2047
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,840
there's a quite a bit more we won't go

2048
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,679
into that

2049
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,520
at the moment here

2050
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,440
we can come back to it if

2051
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,960
anybody really wants to

2052
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,678
be sure we get some more stuff covered

2053
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:42,399
here okay here's a

2054
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,399
here's a good one

2055
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,119
let me buzz down here

2056
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:51,119
a little ways

2057
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,880
these are all star charts furnished by

2058
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,279
the corinthians

2059
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:58,159
listing major stars

2060
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:00,800
and the planets orbiting them

2061
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:02,399
they're all in the little e-book

2062
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,400
so you can study them in detail if you

2063
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:05,399
like

2064
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,480
i don't know why we got a break we're

2065
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:13,198
getting some drop outs

2066
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:15,519
okay that's the last of the list

2067
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,359
which shows uh

2068
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:21,040
a summary there

2069
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,039
i can find my summary card here

2070
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:33,479
it shows the

2071
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,480
25 most important planets

2072
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:43,119
it show that shows that 75

2073
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:44,719
of the brightest stars of the naked eye

2074
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:48,158
were listed

2075
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:50,239
15 only 15 of the 75

2076
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:52,479
have no planets now our astronomers are

2077
01:20:50,238 --> 01:20:54,799
having a little bit trouble of trouble

2078
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:57,198
finding planets and they believe that

2079
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,800
if we find another star with planets

2080
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:01,279
we're going to be lucky

2081
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,440
it may tend to prove that there could be

2082
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,679
somebody else besides us

2083
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:08,238
in this whole vast universe

2084
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:10,319
the corinthians see

2085
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:12,000
that about 90 percent

2086
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,399
or more of

2087
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,600
all stars have planets families of

2088
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:17,839
planets

2089
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,679
of the 75 that they listed for us only

2090
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:24,239
15 have no planets

2091
01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:26,880
252 are of the planets are inhabited

2092
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,559
and 165 of those known planets are not

2093
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,679
inhabited

2094
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:35,199
four there are 417 total planets

2095
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:36,719
in the 75 star system

2096
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:39,678
corondor

2097
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:43,480
is the third planet out

2098
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,480
from the stark arena

2099
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,679
got a lot of papers up here they're a

2100
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,679
bit of a problem

2101
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:55,678
there's a map of corondor

2102
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:58,479
again it's

2103
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,239
seen beyond our tourists it's 411 light

2104
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:01,519
years from earth

2105
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:06,479
it's the third

2106
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:09,360
planted out from its star corina

2107
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:11,119
the capital city is right in here it's

2108
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,439
rel city

2109
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,119
is a capital for the planet

2110
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:19,119
it's uh

2111
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,119
over three times the size of earth

2112
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,479
uh

2113
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,760
it's the top scientific planet of the

2114
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:35,679
alliance one of the best in our galaxy

2115
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,679
it's the home of ndwa

2116
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:43,439
and major industries the major city is

2117
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,440
pharrell city

2118
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,198
the

2119
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:52,560
it has

2120
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:55,920
more land mass for water than we have it

2121
01:22:52,560 --> 01:23:00,320
has about 60 percent land mass

2122
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:01,840
where ours is probably less than 30 35

2123
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:03,439
it's a bigger planet it's three times

2124
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:07,000
the size of ours

2125
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:07,000
it has uh

2126
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,639
it has a a stronger

2127
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,079
gravity it's a

2128
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,199
although the planet is three times the

2129
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:19,359
size of ours it only has

2130
01:23:16,198 --> 01:23:21,119
3.2 times our gravity

2131
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,839
which is quite a bit for us they say

2132
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:24,399
that

2133
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,920
an earth human standing on the surface

2134
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,158
of mars

2135
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,679
of corondorf if he fell down he's likely

2136
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:31,839
to break bones

2137
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,880
and if he stood in a corindian rainstorm

2138
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:38,239
he'd be pelted to death by the raindrops

2139
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:40,639
so we can't visit corondor

2140
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,158
in our earth bodies

2141
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:43,199
very easily

2142
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:46,079
so

2143
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:50,638
they explained to bob that

2144
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:52,559
all planets have that have evolved

2145
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:54,239
life forms and most as we see from the

2146
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,080
listing here most of them do and are

2147
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:57,039
inhabited so life forms have evolved

2148
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:58,960
there

2149
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:00,319
that all planets

2150
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,960
are different from each other they're

2151
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:06,000
like the leaves of a tree or snowflakes

2152
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:08,079
there are no two planets identical

2153
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,079
and the conditions on

2154
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:11,760
there's no identical conditions on two

2155
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,920
planets and so

2156
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,000
the life form that evolves the

2157
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,119
archetypical life form that evolves on

2158
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,920
the planet

2159
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:20,399
is

2160
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,560
it evolves peculiar to the conditions of

2161
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:24,399
that particular planet

2162
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,480
and for them to go to another planet

2163
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:29,119
sometimes it's too

2164
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:31,359
inhospitable for

2165
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:34,000
anybody to make the trip elsewhere

2166
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:36,880
so they discovered that

2167
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,238
in the process that they use of coming

2168
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,440
here

2169
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:41,238
they

2170
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,599
they use a something like a

2171
01:24:41,238 --> 01:24:45,198
teleportation process

2172
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,560
where they step into a cabinet on

2173
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:48,158
corridor

2174
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,080
and step out of a cabinet at the

2175
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:52,399
receiving station in the in the base

2176
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:55,039
here before they had a base here they

2177
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:57,198
had to project the base

2178
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:58,800
to this planet and receive it at the

2179
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,399
projected base

2180
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,400
and that was difficult because it

2181
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:04,719
limited what could be transmitted but

2182
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,638
they transmitted enough to build a

2183
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,639
proper receiving

2184
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:10,480
port on on earth

2185
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,639
and then they began to teleport their

2186
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:15,279
equipment and people here directly

2187
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:17,279
now they said they told bob renaud they

2188
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,439
said we don't look

2189
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,759
exactly like you in our native state

2190
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:23,279
that if you could see us

2191
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,520
as we live on corondor you would

2192
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:27,439
probably think we're ugly as a matter of

2193
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,040
fact we think you're ugly too

2194
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:29,919
when we look at you

2195
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:32,800
but

2196
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,480
bob always saw those visitors as the

2197
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,639
women were extremely beautiful there

2198
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:38,158
were no fat ones no skinny ones

2199
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:42,000
they were all pretty well stacked the

2200
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:44,399
men were good looking strong hunks

2201
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,800
handsome and he thought they must have a

2202
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:48,479
planet of beautiful people there

2203
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,920
and now the corinthians are explaining

2204
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,638
to them when they

2205
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,000
come here they are teleported here

2206
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,319
and when they're received at the

2207
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,520
teleport station here their atoms are

2208
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:00,559
assembled

2209
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:03,040
on the earth archetypical form it's our

2210
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:06,080
ideal form for earth

2211
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:07,279
in earth chemistry and so they do look

2212
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:10,559
handsome they

2213
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:13,279
we don't archetypically

2214
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:16,159
visualize

2215
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:17,679
crippled people diseased people

2216
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:19,119
so they were explaining to him what his

2217
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,440
body would look like when they took him

2218
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,719
to corindor they said the reverse is

2219
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:24,960
true when you go there we have an

2220
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,399
archetypical form oh we only got two

2221
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,520
minutes late

2222
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:29,359
and

2223
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,400
when you get there you they said your

2224
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:32,399
body

2225
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:33,439
will look like this and they show them

2226
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:35,359
an image

2227
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:37,279
the image i showed him was a little bit

2228
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:38,399
shorter than he stood

2229
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:42,000
it had

2230
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:43,359
very strong neck muscles had a a a heavy

2231
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,920
skull

2232
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:47,279
strong nest muscles strong muscular

2233
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,399
frame

2234
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:51,679
stocky

2235
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:53,039
torso and legs to sandy at increased

2236
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,239
gravity there

2237
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:56,560
and

2238
01:26:54,238 --> 01:27:00,158
it had

2239
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:02,239
the body and breathed gas with less a

2240
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:04,960
richer atmosphere than ours was normal

2241
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:06,238
for it ours is a little weak for the

2242
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,158
corinthians when they come here and they

2243
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:10,638
take it takes the time for them to

2244
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:14,158
adjust to acclimatize to our

2245
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:16,400
our uh less rich oxygen

2246
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:17,439
atmosphere here

2247
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:20,799
and

2248
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:22,559
so they invited they actually

2249
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,960
they invited about to come there now

2250
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,639
when i started this

2251
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,480
and i bob

2252
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,480
bob brown says what would you speak on i

2253
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:31,519
said well i from my age i'd like to look

2254
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:33,359
back

2255
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,960
i think i have pretty good hindsight now

2256
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:36,719
and i know that we threw out some very

2257
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,039
important cases and i'd like to

2258
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:41,279
talk about the bob renaud case

2259
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:43,039
so he said okay

2260
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:44,639
and so when i started doing the research

2261
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,319
on he put that in a bulletin by the way

2262
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:49,520
he put it out on his website that i was

2263
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:51,439
going to talk about corrindor

2264
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,480
and about three weeks ago i received an

2265
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:54,399
email

2266
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:55,678
and i've been looking for bob bernat for

2267
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:58,079
30 years

2268
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:59,039
everywhere he just disappeared from

2269
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:00,319
sight

2270
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:01,840
together

2271
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:02,960
and i couldn't find him

2272
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,440
and

2273
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,359
now i get an email letter from bob

2274
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:09,119
renaud

2275
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:10,158
and he said that it had been his

2276
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:13,679
practice

2277
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:15,920
to search the web and the e-net for any

2278
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:18,158
references to corondor periodically for

2279
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,760
the last 50 years

2280
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:22,158
very seldom found anything but he

2281
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,239
suddenly hit got a hit he found corondor

2282
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:27,119
mentioned and was going to be discussed

2283
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:28,559
at this conference here at this time and

2284
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:29,599
i was going to be the speaker and he

2285
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,039
gave my

2286
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,280
email address

2287
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,719
he looked me up in the web and he got my

2288
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:37,039
web page which gave him the email

2289
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,319
address he sent me an email later and he

2290
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:40,560
said

2291
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:42,799
i i see you're going to talk about my

2292
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,880
case he said you know i haven't been

2293
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,960
putting anything out on it he said it's

2294
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,880
not really for public consumption he

2295
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,920
says they don't understand it takes too

2296
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,760
long to educate them he said i don't

2297
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,199
mind if you want to talk about the case

2298
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,960
but he said

2299
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:58,799
the case is still going on you know i

2300
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,600
said no i didn't know that

2301
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,520
he said i have had contacts ever since i

2302
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,280
terminated the arrangements with

2303
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,639
gabriel greene he said i gave some

2304
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:08,559
information to

2305
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:10,400
john dean and after that i just stopped

2306
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,840
sending information out to anybody

2307
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:14,079
but he said i've been making notes all

2308
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,000
this time he said i have hundreds of

2309
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:18,960
pages of notes would you like to have

2310
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,359
some i said oh i i sure would

2311
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:24,158
two or three days later i received a big

2312
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:25,198
cd in the mail from bob reynolds 400

2313
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:27,759
pages

2314
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:29,919
of new information contact notes on his

2315
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,360
contacts since then he'd been to the

2316
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:34,960
moon twice more and he'd been to the

2317
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:37,359
planet corridor several times

2318
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:39,920
working there and operating there in his

2319
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:41,839
corinthian body when he steps out of the

2320
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,279
teleportation cabinet in corridor he's

2321
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,840
in his corinthian body when he comes

2322
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:48,158
back here he's in his earth body

2323
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,279
and he he said i have

2324
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:50,960
written

2325
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,119
done a little writing on the moon trips

2326
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,198
but he said i have written nothing on my

2327
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:58,158
trips to corridor because they suggested

2328
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:59,439
i not do so he said the first one was a

2329
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:02,079
business trip

2330
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:03,759
and the next one was a recreational trip

2331
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:05,760
he said i could probably

2332
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,760
describe the recreational trip but he

2333
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,679
says i have never written it up and he's

2334
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,440
had a couple more trips since then and

2335
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:12,719
they welcome him when he gets there as

2336
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:14,079
an old friend

2337
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,079
many of his

2338
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:18,559
contemporaries are still there they live

2339
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:20,719
an average of a thousand years

2340
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,080
time's up they live an average of a

2341
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,319
thousand years

2342
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:26,158
whereas we live shorter lives so

2343
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:27,840
most of the people that he interacted

2344
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:29,599
with are still there

2345
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,600
or still here well they still have their

2346
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,440
bases here there's one

2347
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,520
underground in massachusetts one off the

2348
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:38,079
coast of san diego underwater one in the

2349
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,239
south atlantic and they have some bases

2350
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:42,800
in other countries now also and speak

2351
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:45,359
the other languages where their

2352
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:48,159
expeditionary teams happen to be

2353
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:49,679
they also have by the way they have

2354
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:51,839
prepared

2355
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,520
what they call

2356
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,760
agents of theirs but

2357
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,960
they're people that have been especially

2358
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,199
trained and conditioned to live here

2359
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:02,079
that move out into our earth

2360
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:04,479
society and are maneuvered in to

2361
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:06,319
positions of semi-authority and they

2362
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:07,839
said they have some of their agents are

2363
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:10,238
in the pentagon some are in the white

2364
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,079
house some are in congress some are in

2365
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:14,399
the senate he said they have

2366
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:16,880
successfully infiltrated our population

2367
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,519
to a great degree as well

2368
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,480
as the governmental bodies of russia and

2369
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,600
they said

2370
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:24,000
it's

2371
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,320
that the collapse of the russian import

2372
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,279
and explodes the cold war

2373
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:31,119
is due to in some extent to the

2374
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:33,519
contribution of our agents working

2375
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:35,599
internally and quietly to

2376
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,280
tamp things down and he said we are

2377
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,719
still trying to keep things a little

2378
