1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,359
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,099
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
cannabis strain history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,059
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,419
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,140
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,699
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,439
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,340
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,340
to the underground

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,219
welcome to Peter's Syndicate I'm here

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,839
with local botanist our very good friend

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,420
from the breeder Syndicate and we have

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,379
thousand fold here to help me Host this

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,899
um thousand you want to tell them what

23
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,780
we're going to be talking about today

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,640
yeah welcome everybody so last week we

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,280
covered the technical aspects of the

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,679
seed making process and as we promised

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,480
this episode is the first episode in a

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,299
series on breeding

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,459
so some disclaimers to start us off

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,340
breeding is a huge and extremely complex

31
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:14,099
topic we are not authorities and cannot

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,900
promise perfect information and you know

33
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,280
I'll do my best and I'm sure the other

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,080
two will do their best as well to

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,420
signpost clearly when

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,000
we're uncertain or when we just don't

37
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,780
know

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,259
why

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,000
you're gonna lie okay that's cool

40
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,618
today's episode will be an overview on

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,019
some of the science and theory behind

42
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:37,019
breeding and where it does and does not

43
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,879
meet up with the Practical reality

44
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,739
again because breeding is such a big and

45
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,739
complex topic we're going to try to draw

46
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,118
a loose parameter around it uh perimeter

47
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,219
I should say around it

48
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,900
um a Line in the Sand so we have a

49
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,519
foundation to work from for the

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,159
subsequent episodes

51
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,618
in the subsequent episodes we I think

52
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,259
will want to cover different historical

53
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,739
or hypothetical breeding scenarios and

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,719
that will allow us to get more into the

55
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:05,719
particularities nuances of breeding

56
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,479
um

57
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,219
yeah in terms of how today's show is

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,800
going to be laid out

59
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,340
um we're going to first of all cover the

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,560
or gesture towards the mendelian science

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,020
behind breeding and some of its limits

62
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,120
we're then going to move on to an

63
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,459
overview of breeding techniques and

64
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,280
strategies and kind of give

65
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,780
an isolated account of each with a

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,539
little bit of context

67
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,459
and finally we'll summarize

68
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,598
um with the section called what makes

69
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,598
breeding so hard

70
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,800
but yeah without further Ado I wanted to

71
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,560
dive into

72
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,420
some of the science behind breeding

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
um specifically

74
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,738
the science drawn from Mendel's

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,559
principles so the mendelian framework of

76
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,200
breeding because

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,180
this is many I think many of us have

78
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,939
this as a reference point many of us

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,439
have maybe picked us up at high school

80
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:05,878
or you know it's pretty easy to pick up

81
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,039
now if you haven't come across this

82
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,840
before and I do recommend it

83
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,239
um I'm not going to actually teach

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
people what this is but what I will say

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,599
is that

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,759
Mendel's principles of inheritance

87
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,679
provide like a basic understanding of

88
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,179
how traits are passed from parents to

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,719
offspring

90
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,000
and kind of laid the basis for modern

91
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,979
breeding in the 20th century

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,439
so indeed paired pretty closely with

93
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,539
that is the Punnett square and some of

94
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,219
you will be familiar with that it's

95
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,060
basically a little table that helps you

96
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,979
predict potential outcomes of crosses

97
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,019
between two individuals it's like a

98
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,658
visual representation of the possible

99
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,239
combination of alleles and helps you

100
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,939
determine like the genotypic and

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,378
phenotypic ratios for The Offspring yes

102
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,620
but

103
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:58,139
again trying to draw a line around that

104
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,180
essentially the tool is meant to help

105
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,318
you predict design and control your

106
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,580
breeding project

107
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,199
correct

108
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,819
um

109
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,139
and why I wanted to start with this is

110
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,298
because

111
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,158
I think there's actually quite a big

112
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,500
disconnect between

113
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,039
that

114
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,680
idealized simplified theory of breeding

115
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,540
and the actual reality of breeding and I

116
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,400
would agree

117
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,919
yeah I mean

118
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,198
before I kind of dive into some of the

119
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,060
reasons why that is I don't know Matt

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,460
did you or local did you want to say

121
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,220
anything about

122
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:42,560
you know your Vibe with

123
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,560
the mendelian stuff in general

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,540
um not off of the top of my head

125
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,339
so with with Mendel's stuff in general

126
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,319
that's like you said it's usually the

127
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,779
first place a lot of people encounter

128
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,540
any kind of genetic uh learning whether

129
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,719
it's in high school or you know uh

130
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,720
College uh intro level botany class or

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,540
even biology for that matter

132
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,960
um yeah it's it's an intro based on

133
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,879
one-to-one pairings of a wealth

134
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,299
um a lot of times that means very simple

135
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,918
traits in an IBL uh we can go more into

136
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,620
that too so people understand what that

137
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:22,978
means but basically it's the idea behind

138
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,959
it is a very uniform predictable line

139
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,538
crossed to another uniform predictable

140
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,779
lie and what will come from those

141
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:33,120
pairings when there are very simple

142
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:35,038
traits uh be it parents with blue eyes

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
parents with brown eyes very simple

144
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,139
one-to-one trait reading

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,740
I think that's a perfect place to start

146
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,439
um

147
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,079
and yeah so like Matt said the simple

148
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,639
mendelian framework first of all assumes

149
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,918
that well not first of all but generally

150
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,860
assumes that traits are like easily

151
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,478
identifiable easily measurable and that

152
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,100
they are each trade is controlled by a

153
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,839
single Gene so there's like a one-to-one

154
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,720
correspondence between the trade and

155
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,339
Gene for for this model to kind of like

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
be at its best

157
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,519
so we actually have our first question

158
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,339
here as well which I think is quite

159
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,198
important in the winner asks I really

160
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,599
want to know what it's meant by true

161
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,000
breeding I understand past traits but

162
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,539
what is the test to make sure that it's

163
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,538
true

164
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,780
um so I will say this that in terms of

165
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,538
science

166
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,179
um attributing Trail plant means that it

167
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,439
is homozygous for that trait or if

168
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,600
you're talking about a Pure Line in

169
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,639
journal you're saying that those plants

170
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,759
are homozygous

171
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
um for most traits yes local does that

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,020
sound right to you

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,660
um yeah that makes sense

174
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,399
and like I kind of am curious from a

175
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,800
practical point of view if you don't

176
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,719
have the science how how can you tell

177
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,759
whether something a trait or a plant is

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,600
true breeding only by observing the

179
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,180
progeny that's like the simple basic way

180
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,500
um should you have to give examples

181
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,579
on this

182
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,060
sure

183
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,579
so like uh example loop on it

184
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,879
um it's a worked blueberry line

185
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,779
um we knew that just from

186
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,819
uh

187
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,779
practical data from other people having

188
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:18,919
grown it that it typically in most rooms

189
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,179
would Express heavily blueberry terpenes

190
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:23,579
with that said we didn't know that it

191
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,038
would necessarily breed true for those

192
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,439
traits meaning anything it's crossed to

193
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,060
or whatever it's crossed to we didn't

194
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,939
know for sure if it would pass those

195
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,199
berry traits consistently you know and

196
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,360
that would be true so we were trying to

197
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,759
see if it was true reading for a single

198
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,038
trait so in those crosses when we did

199
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,720
them most of the time no matter what it

200
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,418
was crossed to the berry traits were

201
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,860
dominant therefore it's not totally true

202
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,719
breeding but it's more true breeding

203
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,720
than most plants you'll find in cannons

204
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,620
yeah um I'll also add on that you kind

205
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,439
of have to look for something to breed

206
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,019
Truth for one trait like you can't

207
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,199
assume that one plant's gonna breathe

208
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:09,060
true for like six different traits you

209
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,000
know in this you have to kind of Target

210
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,160
a single trade yeah

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,959
um that's a big thing to notice too in

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,300
cannabis or to to note

213
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,918
yeah yeah yeah

214
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,780
for sure

215
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,519
um and I think that that takes me to our

216
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,399
next Point as well you know one of the

217
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,359
other reasons why it's so difficult to

218
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,698
apply

219
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,000
Mendel's model like Matt already said is

220
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,560
that we have a distinct lack of fixed or

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,979
true breeding traits and true

222
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,139
homozygosity in cannabis right so

223
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,300
there's another little narrative that

224
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,158
comes out of Mendel's framework which

225
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,278
people love to refer to

226
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,919
which is the idea that you have two you

227
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,200
begin with two true breeding parents

228
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,899
you cross them to produce a true F1

229
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,820
hybrid with heterosis and hybrid Vigor

230
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,159
right people look to spin this narrative

231
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,600
well you also have to say that they're

232
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,319
if you're going to make a true F1 hybrid

233
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,899
it has to be too distinctly

234
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,640
uh distinct and different genotypes

235
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,500
that's that's one of the other most

236
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,699
important parts for a true F1 hybrid it

237
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,679
has to be two distinctly different

238
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,820
genotypes

239
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,799
sure

240
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,660
and then people also like to talk about

241
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,778
the fact that yep in a true F1 hybrid

242
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:24,958
population it's meant to be homogeneous

243
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:26,700
if you have two properly homozygous

244
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,139
parents correct

245
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,600
um but that doesn't happen in cannabis

246
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,580
I'll say that oh right and second

247
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,000
secondly the stage that's meant to

248
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,500
follow that is the F2 stage and

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,480
according to Mendel's model when you

250
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,740
begin with two true breeding distinct

251
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,220
parents

252
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,100
it's in the F2 Generation where you're

253
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,660
meant to see genotypic segregation

254
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,920
correct

255
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,199
however

256
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,620
in our world you couldn't see

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,839
segregation probably at every generation

258
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,480
correct so this model

259
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,740
doesn't work on that point

260
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,899
no

261
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,320
um and it is interesting to me when I

262
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,320
think about

263
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,459
um

264
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,379
what you make of a pack of seeds that

265
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,000
you bought that says

266
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,639
F1 F2

267
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,639
because you know people make assumptions

268
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:24,799
based on Mendel's framework they sure do

269
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,799
what what those things actually mean

270
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:31,259
um okay so in addition to that that

271
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:34,439
Narrative of the true F1 hybrid going to

272
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:37,500
F2 with segregation some of the other

273
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,660
reasons why we can't easily apply

274
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,100
Mendel's framework

275
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,860
um one there's something called

276
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,360
polygenic traits I.E these are single

277
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,120
traits that could be controlled by

278
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,579
multiple genes

279
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,600
and again if you look at Mendel's

280
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:53,099
framework

281
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,040
they're meant to be one-to-one

282
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,659
correspondences so that already adds a

283
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,939
significant amount of complexity to your

284
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:02,399
search or your experiment

285
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,779
the next one is genetic linkage so you

286
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,700
have genes that are kind of grouped

287
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:08,159
linked within the same chromosome that

288
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,720
further complicates your efforts to kind

289
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,659
of like isolate

290
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,399
uh correspondences yep

291
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,159
um you have something else called I

292
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,899
don't know if I'm saying this term right

293
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,179
pleiotropy

294
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:23,220
pleiotropyotropy yeah where it's one

295
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,099
gene that actually affects multiple

296
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,139
traits so it's the inverse of polygenic

297
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,839
where polygenics one trade control by

298
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:34,860
multiple genes this is one gene

299
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,959
affecting multiple traits yes so I think

300
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,600
they're actually even more yeah there's

301
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,099
there's a a really important one when it

302
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,920
comes to cannabis called suppressor

303
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,500
traits and um and and that's another

304
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,778
version of the link trait and suppressor

305
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,759
traits instead of like a linked trait

306
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,078
being like if this trait is here in this

307
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,120
plant and this trade is here in this

308
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,259
plant all of a sudden you see this this

309
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,959
trait that you hadn't seen before

310
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,240
because it needs both factors to show it

311
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,199
uh with a suppressor trait it's the

312
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,299
opposite

313
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,700
needs both traits to suppress it and all

314
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,319
of a sudden this trade is gone whereas

315
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,540
like both parents may have something

316
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,120
that you think is awesome but for

317
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,639
whatever reason certain alleles or or

318
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,320
Genies line up differently and then once

319
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,019
across that suppressor trait completely

320
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,519
suppresses a specific trait so that's

321
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,980
also in there too a super important

322
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,539
cannabis it's been never used to refer

323
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,539
to it as the ghost trait

324
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,539
um

325
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,819
also add

326
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,278
um I was reading earlier

327
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,860
um that there are uh you know obviously

328
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,078
what we call uh dominant traits but

329
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,879
they're like additive traits you know

330
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,638
kind of the opposite of your suppressor

331
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,740
trait that you were talking about so I

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,959
guess you know here's an example since I

333
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,120
can't really speak at you know at a

334
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:55,439
strain level you know

335
00:12:51,120 --> 00:13:00,240
um so say uh we have fish in the wild

336
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,000
um there's this a gene a uh you know one

337
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,539
that allows for it to have

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,220
um

339
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,860
you know

340
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,339
it Blends in so it's not heavily

341
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,019
predated right and then there are these

342
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,700
additive genes that are going to have to

343
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:19,980
do with size

344
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:23,339
and so that fish can if it has that

345
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,039
dominant gene will be true for that you

346
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:29,180
know uh less lesser amount of predation

347
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,919
Gene but you know have variable

348
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:34,679
variability in size due to those like

349
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,740
additive you know type genes

350
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,039
um it's still gonna be true for that

351
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,379
like anti-predation

352
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,919
Gene but you're gonna have these other

353
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,600
influences that are not really going to

354
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,278
affect that dominant Gene's effect

355
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,980
gotcha

356
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:56,100
gotcha I'm not sure if that that really

357
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,778
oh yeah that's no that's super cool I

358
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,920
think you know for me this preparing for

359
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:01,259
this episode has been really different

360
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:04,139
from the other ones because the other

361
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,759
ones I could kind of like Loosely sketch

362
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,339
the structure off the top of my head

363
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,559
whereas this one because I am an amateur

364
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,459
obviously I actually have to do a bit of

365
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,679
like

366
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,659
personal investigation you know like

367
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,099
actual some actual research and so a lot

368
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,259
of these a lot of the points I just made

369
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,060
are new things that I've learned and

370
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:25,439
it's it's amazing to me

371
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:26,939
um just how complex and wild the reality

372
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,600
of

373
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,300
um like you know uh sexual reproduction

374
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,060
and and all the complexities

375
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:39,419
um of the genetics are

376
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,458
um so yeah I've used this example

377
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,379
several times and we probably won't get

378
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,679
into epigenetics because it's so little

379
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:49,198
known about it especially but yeah but

380
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,479
um the example I I that is kind of like

381
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,759
a um paradigm shift for me was learning

382
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,699
that a male that smokes one single

383
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,679
cigarette right and he smokes one single

384
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:01,379
cigarette it'll affect his progeny down

385
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,939
for Generations through epigenetics and

386
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:06,360
that's like a scientific that's like in

387
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,920
paper papers now so that that really

388
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,778
blew my mind because if you think about

389
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,819
the stressors that we put our cannabis

390
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,519
through and the epigenetics and all that

391
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,620
like you can imagine how far down we are

392
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,740
affecting progeny without even realizing

393
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,560
what we're breeding with so I absolutely

394
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,120
yeah an environmental factors it's

395
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,259
important for breeders to be competent

396
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Growers

397
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,299
for that reason

398
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,980
yeah environmental factors in general

399
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,859
um can't be covered by this model of

400
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,940
heritability it's It's precisely the one

401
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,940
of the major things that's being

402
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,160
excluded yeah

403
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,260
yeah so I guess

404
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,299
those are kind of the general points

405
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,720
that I wanted to gesture towards

406
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,439
and it was mostly to name

407
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,160
um

408
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,220
some of the many reasons why you cannot

409
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,559
just say hey take that framework and now

410
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,560
just slap it on because

411
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:05,159
this science is a simplified idealized

412
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:07,319
model yes very idealized it's not a

413
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,539
one-size-fit-all

414
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,760
um at all so

415
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,679
um I think I was I kind of want to

416
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
conclude this section just by saying

417
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,799
like it doesn't mean that we have to

418
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,100
throw all the signs out the window

419
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,958
they're obviously still really really

420
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,920
important principles that mendels

421
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,419
outlined that absolutely relate

422
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,939
um and there's so many kind of

423
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,278
techniques and strategies for breeding

424
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,699
that come out of these principles

425
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,500
that are still fundamental to Modern

426
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:38,879
breeding

427
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,379
um maybe the last thing I just wanted to

428
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,179
also

429
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,519
throw a mention at which we won't go

430
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,219
into is of course there's there's much

431
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,560
more modern science now Beyond Mendel we

432
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,079
have Micro assisted breeding

433
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,439
and stuff like that but that's going to

434
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,419
be outside the scope of our talk today I

435
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,279
think definitely since I don't do any

436
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,319
marker assisted braiding I could not

437
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,958
talk confidently got that

438
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,660
does do we have people doing that in

439
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,418
cannabis yet Chimera doing like we know

440
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,640
of chimera we know he's done some great

441
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,780
marker assistive reading

442
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,459
yeah yeah

443
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:17,279
that's cool yeah that's that's

444
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,720
definitely beyond beyond us for today

445
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,859
okay

446
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,019
so I did I did not want to segue into an

447
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,740
overview of various breeding techniques

448
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:27,740
and strategies

449
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,620
um

450
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,360
and I think to begin this section the

451
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,279
two really really important questions

452
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,219
that I think both of you could help

453
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,558
expand on is number one what material

454
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,900
are you actually starting with and

455
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,440
number two what are your breeding goals

456
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,440
yes

457
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,679
you had yeah you had quite a bit I think

458
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,480
you know you and you and local and

459
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,280
myself had a little discussion yesterday

460
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,140
about this and

461
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,440
you know what do you think it takes to

462
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,980
actually know what you are starting with

463
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,980
you know

464
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,119
this has been like the the drum I've

465
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,798
been beating as and probably you know

466
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,779
like I get I get a lot of comments about

467
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,418
me being the strained police or genetic

468
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,339
police or you know like the fun police

469
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,320
when it comes to cannabis strains why

470
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,199
you take that so serious who cares it's

471
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:24,058
dank who cares smoke it but the problem

472
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,100
is like for breeders if you don't know

473
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:28,440
what you're working with and you don't

474
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:29,399
have a firm grip on the history

475
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,798
um

476
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,600
for example you go buy your first pack

477
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,099
of seeds or not even your first pack you

478
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,538
just go buy a pack of seeds from someone

479
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,759
you don't really know that much about

480
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:39,960
but you've seen their stuff advertised

481
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,240
in High Times right

482
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,100
you take it home you go make crosses

483
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,220
with it and you find out five years

484
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:50,159
later that this was actually bought from

485
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,558
Spain and was a bulk purchase and it's

486
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,660
just some random maybe OG crisscross

487
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,418
made in Spain that was relabeled as

488
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,759
something else so at this point you've

489
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,960
been selling seeds or passing out seeds

490
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,940
with

491
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,558
God knows what genetics listed as

492
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,840
something and now your name's tied to it

493
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:11,038
at that point do you

494
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:14,220
what do you do like I so all this data

495
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,140
you've been bringing in like okay I'm

496
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,360
seeing this in my head this is what it

497
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,620
is I'm seeing this expression it must be

498
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,939
from this parent I'm seeing this

499
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:23,099
expression it must be from this parent

500
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,900
and you start adding this data into your

501
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:26,339
data Bank in your brain and you start

502
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,080
growing more strains and now you're

503
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,058
making more conclusions based off that

504
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,339
first grow on what you grew because

505
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:36,000
you're assuming that it was correct so

506
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,720
it so many things happen from this

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,558
um

508
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,079
how do you properly sort through and get

509
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,418
good starting material to work with

510
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,159
that is such a complex process and it's

511
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,020
really a personal journey and it took me

512
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,679
over a decade to really feel confident

513
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:54,058
about who I was buying seats from or who

514
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,298
I was getting seats from in the first

515
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:59,759
place and it really boiled down to

516
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:01,859
knowing your breeder asking your breeder

517
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,740
questions being very confident learning

518
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,839
myself about breeding and and asking

519
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,880
them hard questions about not even

520
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,939
necessarily hard but Earnest questions

521
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,160
about their process of making the seeds

522
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,019
where they Source the cut you know

523
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,360
sometimes talk to the person they Source

524
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,119
the cut from this is all super important

525
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,538
and if you really really want to do

526
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,678
breeding breeding starting material and

527
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:27,660
being confident in your starting

528
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,460
material is as important as anything

529
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,500
else and it's really hard to illustrate

530
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,720
that until someone's further in the

531
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,380
breeding career and they have to go back

532
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,419
and see how accurate their [ __ ] was and

533
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,980
almost no one can nail it in the first

534
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,320
few rounds because of all the

535
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,140
misinformation in cannabis and the the

536
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,960
smoke and mirrors and all that so it's

537
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,400
an overlooked Mega important part of the

538
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,919
breeding process and I can't tell you

539
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,360
how many times people message like me or

540
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,740
one of the other breeders it'll be like

541
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:00,119
yeah

542
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,919
my you know like XYZ some some brand new

543
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,619
guy that we know has never sourced

544
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,360
anything correctly cross to DNA genetics

545
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:07,918
whatever you know like and they want us

546
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,019
to be jazzed about it with them and like

547
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,759
at the same time I know where those guys

548
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,460
Source their stuff and I know there's no

549
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,619
way what he thinks he has he has so

550
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,079
that's an impression he's now left on me

551
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:20,279
that this person really didn't do their

552
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,259
research from the beginning and they're

553
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,480
already making and selling seeds so

554
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,279
there there's a lot to it how your

555
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,200
relationships form in this in this

556
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,399
industry to to learn from people and to

557
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,940
be mentored

558
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,519
can be affected by your choice and

559
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,140
research ability and what you start with

560
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,900
and where you end up and the conclusions

561
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,679
you draw from from said data

562
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,820
um most importantly in my opinion is is

563
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,559
why it's so important to do that

564
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:49,139
research initially

565
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,700
yeah because I mean you if you don't

566
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,980
have a good starting point it's going to

567
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,558
affect all your Downstream you know

568
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,480
actions and and results there's there's

569
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:00,538
several years of projects that I've done

570
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,759
that I look back on even even like seven

571
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:05,759
eight nine years into my career

572
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,339
that I look back on now

573
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,619
and it's embarrassing because some of

574
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,959
them were obviously so off

575
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:14,399
from what I thought they would be

576
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,579
as far as

577
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,620
their part in history

578
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,939
um or what what was actually in them and

579
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,079
then I go and use them because I think

580
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,720
they're dank

581
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,699
and I trust the breeder

582
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,019
but that doesn't always turn out correct

583
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,460
and

584
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,859
there I could think of several examples

585
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,900
where I look goofiest [ __ ] you know like

586
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,459
like looking back I judge myself as

587
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,900
being very goofy for not having done the

588
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,380
proper research and taking someone's

589
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,380
work so

590
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,379
anything you want to add to that local

591
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,259
yeah

592
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,620
um so I mean obviously problem analysis

593
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:53,038
is you know very very important because

594
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:56,519
um you know we we do have to

595
00:22:53,038 --> 00:23:00,419
you know take into consideration ethics

596
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:03,418
um you know like is science you know

597
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,700
obviously like one of the

598
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,759
you know

599
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,220
I guess um key points of it is

600
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,679
to make sure you have ethical data you

601
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,200
know if it's not you know is it really

602
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,980
valid yes

603
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,460
um

604
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,339
but on top of that I'll also add

605
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,159
um you know it this isn't something that

606
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:28,859
you can just like Dive Right into and

607
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,900
start reading from the get-go

608
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,579
um you have to learn your parent

609
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,740
material like

610
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:37,199
you know what I mean like it's not like

611
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,859
you can just make a cross I mean you can

612
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,460
but is that actually like reading yeah

613
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,979
is that breeding no yeah exactly it does

614
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,740
take many cycles to learn a parent

615
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,500
because it's not simply growing a dank

616
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,599
you know while that is one aspect of it

617
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,419
you kind of want to see how it Expresses

618
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,240
in multiple different kinds of grows

619
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:03,120
because then you can kind of gauge what

620
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,740
those progenies May Express

621
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,079
you know if it's leaning towards that

622
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,058
parent if that makes sense you can make

623
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,359
a much better educated guess that way

624
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:15,178
for sure and and educated guesses in in

625
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,819
breeding like in your first the first

626
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,100
pairing educated guesses are a lot of

627
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:21,720
where we all start because before seeing

628
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:25,079
the progeny that's what you have is

629
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,038
educated theories or guesswork based on

630
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,038
observations

631
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:35,339
um I will add too that um I know we did

632
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,100
breeding goals and and uh something else

633
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:41,220
as an episode before but I really felt

634
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:42,599
like it kind of got confused between

635
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,240
um what I was talking about with

636
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,918
breeding and what breeding is and and

637
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,298
with

638
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,100
um I think it was not so on that one

639
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:51,779
saying that you know like breeding is

640
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:55,619
just crossing two things and seeing what

641
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:58,200
happens I I I really firmly believe that

642
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:00,719
breeding is goal oriented and only goal

643
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,400
oriented and that making things to see

644
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,079
what happens yes that's a part of

645
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,360
learning but that is not a part

646
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,000
necessarily a breeding the actual

647
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,859
breeding process proper so I wanted to

648
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,480
clarify that and I thought we could go

649
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,979
much deeper into the actual breeding as

650
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,798
opposed to just

651
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,579
repeating the crossing see what happens

652
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,200
there yeah yeah and I think the only

653
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:23,819
other point I wanted to add or it's

654
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,038
maybe a paraphrase of what both of you

655
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,859
have said but

656
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:30,778
um because there's a distinct lack of

657
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:33,359
good information on provenance in

658
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:34,980
history often you do have to treat your

659
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,879
starting material like it's just a black

660
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,980
box to be guessed right and so

661
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
whether it is

662
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,740
um like local Sid whether you're

663
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,620
starting with parent material and you're

664
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,538
needing to grow them out in in various

665
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:51,058
ways in various environments to kind of

666
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:54,000
really see what they do

667
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:55,558
um because or you're actually having to

668
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,579
run out progeny

669
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,298
to see the kinds of ratios you might get

670
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,339
um

671
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,500
in the phenotypes

672
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:07,798
um to see if you can like

673
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,179
almost uh backwards to juice

674
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:10,619
um

675
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,600
more information about the parents

676
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,219
that's really hard to do without the

677
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,918
experience and I talk in other episodes

678
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,600
like about thousands of plants right

679
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,580
yeah I talk about a lot about learning

680
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,278
the bass lines be it Northern Lights

681
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:25,740
skunk one Haze uh different Africans

682
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,480
like swazi uh Durban things like that

683
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,579
the bass lines and the reason I say that

684
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,259
is for the people who want it backwards

685
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:33,240
to Deuce

686
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,400
um like what possible parentage may be

687
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,259
learning those bass lines is one of the

688
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,759
most important things in being able to

689
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,519
do all that and that's one thing Neville

690
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:44,099
taught me early on as well as

691
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,960
um Hogg James hogtop be the same thing

692
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:48,000
learn the bass lines it's super

693
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,038
important if you if you want to be

694
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,380
serious about breeding know those lines

695
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,960
so I wanted to add that in too because

696
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,340
there's no reason like when you're

697
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,840
starting breeding there's no reason not

698
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,519
to learn those because they are so

699
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,839
important and they are the makeup of

700
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,839
like 90 of what we have out

701
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,179
yeah so I guess what we've really been

702
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,159
addressing

703
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,659
um in this section so far

704
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,000
is the information space and

705
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,760
the kind of tactics that you need to

706
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,659
employ to get as much information as

707
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,200
possible

708
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,640
and and I will I will also add that like

709
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,819
if people are having trouble doing the

710
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,259
research we do have our patreon Discord

711
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,798
um for breeder Syndicate and that's like

712
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:35,759
what we do 24 7 is

713
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:37,859
um talk about genetics history research

714
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,900
how to do this research how to apply the

715
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:41,278
research all that stuff so there are

716
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,900
there are much better resources than

717
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,298
there were at one time

718
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,440
instead of just saying like go do your

719
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:48,000
research we're actually trying to

720
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,860
provide a platform for people to do

721
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,038
their research too

722
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:54,719
absolutely thank you thousand because uh

723
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,460
you know we have our codex we're working

724
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,019
on with the strain base as well because

725
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,179
we want to provide a very accurate

726
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,819
stream base that is not a Wiki where

727
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,798
everybody can add to it and add whatever

728
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:06,778
goofiness they want

729
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,639
um and and we're working on that and

730
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:10,259
thousands put a lot of hours into into

731
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,299
doing this so I'm really stoked for

732
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,900
everybody to check it out

733
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:19,619
oh yeah I'm super hyped about that yeah

734
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,960
okay well coming back to where we are we

735
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:24,178
just talked a bit about how you know

736
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,400
what material you're starting with and

737
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:29,278
some allusion to breeding goals based on

738
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,798
the knowledge that you have of what

739
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:34,319
you're starting with so

740
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,139
I wanted to divide the rest of this

741
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,879
section into two broad

742
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,860
categories

743
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,940
because sometimes your starting point is

744
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:48,240
um

745
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,640
already a couple of individuals perhaps

746
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,380
that you're trying to who's traits

747
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,140
you're trying to narrow down and lock in

748
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,820
other times you might be starting with a

749
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,980
pool of material

750
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,538
in which you are wanting to perform a

751
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,240
search or maybe you're wanting to build

752
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,640
that pool of variability in which to do

753
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,099
the search so I think I wanted to begin

754
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,659
with that side where your I guess an

755
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,939
analogy for this is that you're you're

756
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,200
widening right so there's widening and

757
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,880
then there's narrowing and I think

758
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,278
breathing is this interplay of like

759
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,440
widening possibilities and narrowing

760
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,119
possibilities absolutely so in terms of

761
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,278
the widening I I guess one

762
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,398
characterization of it is like breeding

763
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,140
to explore and preserve and expand

764
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,278
variability

765
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,720
okay

766
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,919
um is there anything you guys wanted to

767
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,960
say just on that note of like reading to

768
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,120
widen to begin with

769
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,860
are we still in the the part where we

770
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,079
just say little bits

771
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:45,178
yeah okay

772
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,579
um well the one thing I'll say is that

773
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,320
cannabis itself for the most part is a

774
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,259
very wide variable

775
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,178
plant and I mean like a lot of people

776
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:55,740
talk about oh that's just so

777
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,899
bottlenecked and inbred there are very

778
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,120
few things I can I can reference in my

779
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:01,678
brain that have been hardcore bottleneck

780
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:03,479
other than things like you know cookies

781
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,100
has been shown to starting to be

782
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,740
bottlenecked genetically and that's why

783
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,959
we're seeing like mostly one expression

784
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,058
come out of all these you know different

785
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,120
gelato crosses

786
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:16,139
um or gelato selfs I should say

787
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,939
um

788
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,259
but yeah it's already a very variable

789
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,399
gene pool so a lot of people talk about

790
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:26,519
bottlenecking and it's less of a concern

791
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:28,319
overall than most people think as far as

792
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,839
like uh it might not be variable enough

793
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,158
it's cannabis is pretty freaking

794
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,319
variable and most people are breeding

795
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,419
with poly hybrids so

796
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,579
um it's not as much of a concern as most

797
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,919
people make it out to be

798
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,658
I agree so I think this this section for

799
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,940
us is kind of more of an academic

800
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,620
approach where we're just gonna you know

801
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,538
we'll we'll kind of

802
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:51,058
um

803
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,500
artificially or not just assume that for

804
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:55,379
whatever reason someone does want to

805
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,000
increase variable okay and if they did

806
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,799
you know what what are some of the

807
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,619
techniques that they could employ

808
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,538
I mean obviously you have something like

809
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,879
um the concept of open pollination which

810
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:08,099
is uh largely known as a conservation

811
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,860
preservation technique

812
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,538
um would you guys see there as one of

813
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:14,459
the techniques of actually increasing

814
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,440
variability

815
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,640
or not go ahead local local had a good

816
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,259
answer on this and we were talking about

817
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,299
it

818
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,759
um so

819
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,538
open pollination

820
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,359
um

821
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:29,398
I feel like it's really only ideal like

822
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,379
as you were saying thousand kind of in a

823
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,178
preservation conservation type of

824
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,320
scenario

825
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,340
um

826
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:40,319
you know I think cannabis is a crop that

827
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:42,898
you know has to kind of be like

828
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,879
directionally selected for at this point

829
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:46,678
you know because if you keep open

830
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,380
pollinating something you're just gonna

831
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,220
lose traits you know

832
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,240
um

833
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,579
by diluting them into you know instead

834
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,500
of making it a one to ten chance of

835
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:00,898
finding this Fina you might change that

836
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,480
into like one to two hundred or one to

837
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:06,719
100 or something one to ten thousand in

838
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,440
some cases you know yeah

839
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,538
um

840
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,640
so I think that's really one of the

841
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:18,898
biggest drawbacks to open pollination

842
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:22,860
um you know an alternative could be like

843
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:25,379
um a quote-unquote uh selective uh type

844
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:28,199
open pollination where you you select a

845
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,559
handful of males on a handful of females

846
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,759
or all the females or whatever you know

847
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,278
um

848
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,278
just because you're kind of weeding out

849
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,558
anything that and again this is all

850
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,500
subjective and all personal because

851
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,200
you're the person making selection

852
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,240
so you know obviously there's that

853
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,880
pressure

854
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,079
um so I mean really at the end of it

855
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,240
it's just

856
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,339
you know growing the progeny out because

857
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,960
you won't know if you expanded that gene

858
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:00,839
pool until

859
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,419
you actually see what it spit out

860
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:06,119
yeah and again you get back into the the

861
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,679
ability or maybe even accidental by

862
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,379
selecting one trait you've removed the

863
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,059
trait that you want you know like and

864
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,760
you know and this can be done in open

865
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:16,740
pollination you know or it could be you

866
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,319
could actually screw it up by doing just

867
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,700
a little bit of selection by ah you know

868
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:22,079
this one harms a little bit let's take

869
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,460
that one out and leave the rest of these

870
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,319
for the open pollination but that one

871
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,240
that earns maybe the one that had skunk

872
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,278
traits that you were looking for and you

873
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,079
just yanked it because it hurt or didn't

874
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,079
grow fast enough for you you know

875
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:36,538
um yeah this was a good one because you

876
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,820
guys actually answered one of the

877
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:41,339
questions we had which is from e

878
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:44,158
um who did want to hear about in his

879
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:46,079
words not a full op but

880
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,620
um using multiple choice females and

881
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:52,859
males um as your base stock so so me and

882
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:55,500
CSI discussed a lot of that when we were

883
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:57,778
doing the Northern Lights reproduction

884
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,538
what do we leave in and what do we leave

885
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:02,819
out do we want to take out some of the

886
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,859
stuff that we are pretty sure isn't nice

887
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,599
growing or

888
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:08,039
Maybe

889
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,539
you know just different things that we

890
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,239
were seeing in it like we were trying to

891
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:14,519
figure out do we even touch this do we

892
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,678
put our imprints on it and I think in

893
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,239
the end we decided to go with not I

894
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,320
think we in the end we decided to go

895
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,539
with

896
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,280
um just not touching it because it

897
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,800
wasn't ours we felt like it wasn't ours

898
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,659
to touch in the first place like that

899
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,879
um and people wanted nl5 in a pure open

900
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,099
pollination and at that point no one had

901
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:34,319
done you know at least a 50 seed plus

902
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,760
Pop to make those so we wanted instead

903
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,320
of you know the 10 seed pop that was

904
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,359
being sold we wanted to do a nice 50

905
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,480
seed look through because that's what we

906
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:47,000
had or we would have done more

907
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,000
yeah yep very good example

908
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:53,460
um yeah was anything else to add to this

909
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,319
idea of like open or maybe for like

910
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,320
where the term semi-open pollination

911
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,720
okay um another good example might be

912
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,480
skunk one

913
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,519
um skunk one was said to be skunky when

914
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,800
it came out and Sam the skunk man

915
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,599
himself says he did not do anything but

916
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,680
open successive open pollinations on

917
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,838
skunk one

918
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,578
and most of us are familiar with skunk

919
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,159
one now and what you're not going to

920
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,079
find is skunkiness in Skunk one you'll

921
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,960
find anything but that

922
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,220
um he says he intentionally bred out the

923
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,960
skunkiness

924
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,639
but if he's intentionally breeding it

925
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,260
out through open pollinations where he's

926
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,719
not selecting anything I'm not sure how

927
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,520
that was achieved intentionally

928
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,578
but it may be what local is talking

929
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,800
about successive open pollinations

930
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:40,579
accidentally removing a trait

931
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,400
think that I assume also that that

932
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:45,960
approach uh probably sums up a lot of

933
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,220
traditional

934
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,619
um

935
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:51,618
you know uh cannabis plant reading in

936
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,039
in various like indigenous cultures

937
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,500
right it's a kind of like semi-open

938
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,239
every year they choose the best

939
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,338
and yeah they check them all in for the

940
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,598
next year yeah it's mostly semi-open

941
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,920
correct

942
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,200
okay okay

943
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,099
um that's cool I guess one thing I'll

944
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,500
add

945
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,720
um is in kind of um you know

946
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,659
conservation population genetics there's

947
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:18,118
this term called the founder effect and

948
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:22,440
that is pretty much gonna be you know

949
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,480
the individuals and the frequency and

950
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,920
distribution of alleles you know in that

951
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,980
population

952
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,559
you know those are the founding

953
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:35,039
genetic you know

954
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:38,519
material donors so you know what you

955
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,699
have and if that you know frequency for

956
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,639
that certain trait isn't that common

957
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,500
then you know that specific fragment

958
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,920
that you're working with you may have

959
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,838
possibly isolated you know that trait um

960
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,980
yeah out

961
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,019
yeah

962
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,639
yeah and I've always wondered if that

963
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:57,780
happened with Hayes or you know like

964
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,900
there's a lot of them I wonder if that

965
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,740
happens yeah and sadly you know this

966
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:07,019
isn't this right here is more so this is

967
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:09,419
an actual game of chance you know what I

968
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:12,119
mean oh yeah

969
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,180
so that's one thing to add to that

970
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,220
specific type system oh yeah you're

971
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:19,379
gonna predict what phenos the seed's

972
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:22,039
gonna throw out by looking at the seed

973
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,440
yeah right

974
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,820
absolutely absolutely this you know

975
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,099
breeding

976
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,960
is a game of odds right it's it's a game

977
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:34,500
with like frequencies statistical

978
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,740
probabilities yeah absolutely

979
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,199
um okay well the other point I want to

980
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:42,719
move on to within this section of like

981
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,939
exploring uh

982
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,039
uh preserving expanding variability we

983
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,760
have of course outcrossing outbreeding

984
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,759
hybridization

985
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,719
now I was just curious like on this one

986
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,399
I mean there's not a lot to say about it

987
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:57,779
I think everyone understands what what

988
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
this is

989
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,099
um

990
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,599
how often would you

991
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:05,280
outcross just from the just from the

992
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,800
get-go

993
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,940
like under what circumstances would you

994
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,380
just be like Oh I'm starting with this

995
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,720
but you know I'm just gonna immediately

996
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,700
like cross it to something else

997
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,500
so a lot of the times when I like

998
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:17,939
thinking back to my career most of the

999
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,619
times when I would be out Crossing it

1000
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,780
was because I had a clone only selection

1001
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,820
and I didn't want to necessarily

1002
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,339
feminize it because that plant won't

1003
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,200
reverse well or for whatever reason I

1004
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:29,099
may be doing working on another reversal

1005
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,078
project

1006
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,720
but I also like working with males a lot

1007
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,480
I really do because I think there's it's

1008
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,519
it is harder in a sense that the mail

1009
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,260
isn't necessarily showing the visual

1010
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,239
traits it's always going to breed

1011
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,680
whereas females they don't necessarily

1012
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,039
do that either but you get a much better

1013
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,019
idea of their their resin production the

1014
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,880
kind of sense in that particular

1015
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:52,619
expression so you know what to look for

1016
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,900
on and on you know what I mean but with

1017
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,338
males it is it is tends to be more of an

1018
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,740
art form

1019
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:00,000
um in what you do

1020
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:02,519
I don't know

1021
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,739
so I guess like uh one way I could look

1022
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,380
at what you just said is

1023
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:09,358
um you can sometimes hybridize uh uh to

1024
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,358
actually get more information obviously

1025
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,858
right like in the crosses you you'll

1026
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:15,358
start to see like what's actually been

1027
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:17,759
passed and like you said if you've got

1028
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,500
males that's one of the only ways you

1029
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,160
can know and the other thing is

1030
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:25,139
obviously if one one strain has one or a

1031
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,118
few or one desirable trait that you like

1032
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:28,559
and another strain has other desirable

1033
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,960
traits you like and you want them both

1034
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,400
to be in a single strain that's the

1035
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,139
other purpose for hybridization that's

1036
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,980
the main purpose I would say

1037
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:39,420
yeah yeah that makes sense

1038
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,559
um local anything you want to add to

1039
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:46,260
that breeding yeah so the hybridization

1040
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:50,039
part I mean it's

1041
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,560
you know if you kind of know like the

1042
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:55,739
parent material you know and you you

1043
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:58,980
know whatever you popped a few and you

1044
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:00,959
can see it's relatively kind of

1045
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,139
um I guess this is obviously a

1046
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,619
hypothetical situation but you see that

1047
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:10,199
it's uh rather um IBL you know I don't

1048
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,960
think the smartest decision would be to

1049
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,759
you know breed it with itself again

1050
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,699
that's obviously like kind of a case

1051
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,980
where you want to hybridize so that you

1052
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:24,059
don't lose some of that blueberry

1053
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:27,539
potentially again yeah yeah

1054
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:29,039
really good point yep really nice points

1055
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:29,880
okay

1056
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:31,980
um

1057
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,900
I hadn't I had a question here which I

1058
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,039
wasn't very sure of and I didn't I

1059
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,320
didn't really understand how to approach

1060
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,179
it so I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys

1061
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,300
have a go at it but

1062
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:45,299
in terms of variability

1063
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,060
um and having a pool to search through

1064
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,519
are there techniques that allow you to

1065
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:53,338
dig into recessives

1066
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,780
more than otherwise

1067
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:56,279
yeah obviously we're going to get

1068
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,380
resistance coming through you know it's

1069
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,260
cannabis we already mentioned you've

1070
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,338
heterozygosity kind of pervasive so you

1071
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,460
it's not like you're not going to see

1072
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:07,920
recessives in any generation but either

1073
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,079
have y'all like experienced actually

1074
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,820
looking for recessives

1075
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,240
um did I just here in New Zealander say

1076
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,240
y'all

1077
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,578
I do say y'all I'm a weirdo that's

1078
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,880
beautiful

1079
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:23,160
um no yeah I mean otherwise

1080
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,039
use

1081
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,739
oh use like use guys

1082
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:29,460
you guys yeah

1083
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,919
yeah

1084
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,800
um s1s s1s are the one of my favorite

1085
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,920
places to see recesses and um and and

1086
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,539
outliers like specifically selfing is

1087
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,579
one of the quickest ways to see outliers

1088
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,440
in my opinion

1089
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:45,539
that's a funny thing about selfing hey

1090
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,039
because on the one hand you obviously

1091
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:48,960
it's a good tool for locking things in

1092
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,400
or narrowing but on the other hand I

1093
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,980
guess there's an element of it where you

1094
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,960
also will find weird stuff so it's

1095
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,280
double-edged sword a lot of us refer to

1096
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,079
it as a double-edged sword because

1097
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,720
you're gonna see Heist high ceiling low

1098
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,280
floor in a lot of s1s

1099
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,439
that's right and we'll get we'll come

1100
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,940
back to uh solving again in the

1101
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,280
narrowing section

1102
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,559
but yeah local anything on recessives

1103
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,560
and like looking at like

1104
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,139
looking for recessive traits and stuff

1105
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,078
um I mean I would just add on to the S1

1106
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:20,940
I feel like it's the most effective way

1107
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,460
to actually lock in any sort of

1108
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,720
recessives and um you know one thing

1109
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,059
that I've seen

1110
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:31,219
you know rather recently you know for

1111
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:34,500
example bitter did the S1 F2 of the p91

1112
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:37,739
yeah and it's like that in itself I feel

1113
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,320
is like is isolating you know recessive

1114
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:42,598
traits or maybe not even recessive but

1115
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,400
desirable traits within a selective

1116
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,920
selected Fino

1117
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,838
yeah oh yeah and people are going to

1118
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,019
want to hear about that again I think

1119
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,599
when we get to the locking in section

1120
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,219
okay so I had a I had a random one just

1121
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,480
to kind of tie this this section up

1122
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,219
because I don't know much about it

1123
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,539
myself

1124
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:02,338
um I'm not even sure if it necessarily

1125
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:04,800
fits in here but [ __ ] it we're gonna ask

1126
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:07,739
it anyway yeah try cheese cheese wants

1127
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,280
to know about ploidy manipulations

1128
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:12,539
yeah like with culture scene and

1129
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,400
that's that I don't think that fits in

1130
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,460
any of these scenarios people

1131
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,160
manipulating yeah with ploidism with

1132
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,619
with do you have anything there local

1133
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:24,779
yeah so I was gonna say

1134
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,760
um you know really the only way we can

1135
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,440
[ __ ] around with it is by you know

1136
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,680
treating it with you know harsh

1137
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,380
chemicals to induce that mutation

1138
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:37,078
um but I will say that it isn't uncommon

1139
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,180
for certain species to express Express

1140
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,180
different employee levels depending on

1141
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:43,679
like elevation or whatever whatever it

1142
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:45,838
may be

1143
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,578
um so you know I don't want to say it

1144
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,980
does but I also don't want to say it

1145
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:52,859
doesn't occur in cannabis you know and

1146
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,300
maybe are there are there plodiums that

1147
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,578
you can I mean if that's a correct word

1148
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,980
but are there like polyploids can you

1149
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:02,818
identify them visually

1150
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,740
um so I was actually reading a bit

1151
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:07,380
um because I saw this specific question

1152
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:10,559
and I was like okay you know I have

1153
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,358
worked with um a pi that has studied

1154
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,338
like polyploidism

1155
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:17,338
um in relation to like environment you

1156
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:19,440
know Richie works in the Sonora Desert

1157
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:21,960
so it's going to obviously be elevation

1158
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,639
type based stuff sure

1159
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,740
um and there is some correlation you

1160
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,379
know things that are higher in elevation

1161
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:31,259
may have more chromosomes or less

1162
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,940
chromosomes depending but can you is

1163
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,220
there anything about ploidism that you

1164
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,019
can like in cannabis that you can say Ah

1165
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:38,699
that's a polyploid visually without

1166
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,480
being tested

1167
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:43,318
um

1168
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,240
not 100 but I was reading this paper and

1169
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:48,179
they were saying apparently that there

1170
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,439
are going to be less stomata and larger

1171
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:52,799
stomata

1172
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,159
per Leaf area that makes so you still

1173
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,318
need a microscope exactly so it's not

1174
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,480
something you can like physically see

1175
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,179
like you kind of have to study it at the

1176
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,800
because I I see that online a lot like

1177
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:06,598
on Instagram where people be like check

1178
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,640
it out I got a polyploid and like

1179
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,099
they'll show a plant that like has like

1180
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,719
you know weird branching or something

1181
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,940
like you've got a polyploid and it's

1182
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,639
like bro yeah yeah you see that with

1183
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:20,700
people who have like uh fasciations as

1184
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:23,639
well yes yeah yeah it's like no those

1185
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:25,500
those don't necessarily reduce to pause

1186
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,838
yeah that's not correlated to

1187
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:31,579
polyploidism no

1188
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,920
yeah yeah because I I guess polyploidism

1189
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:37,619
is specifically like a chromosomal

1190
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,220
thing right like it's not that's what it

1191
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:43,318
actually corresponds to yeah

1192
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:45,358
okay that's cool and that was just kind

1193
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,980
of a fun one to track in there I just

1194
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,619
wanted to correct that it's polyploidy

1195
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,139
not polyploidism I just remember yeah

1196
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,720
that makes sense

1197
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:57,299
it's kind of an ugly word yeah anyway I

1198
00:45:54,719 --> 00:46:00,179
blame the word

1199
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,940
yeah last minute where it's just yeah

1200
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:04,879
anyway okay so now we move on to what I

1201
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,318
think most people think of as breeding

1202
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,180
where you are trying well that's not

1203
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,460
true but anyway uh breathing to narrow

1204
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:15,059
down and lock in

1205
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,679
yes and I guess the easiest or most

1206
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,019
straightforward one to begin with maybe

1207
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:20,818
is like regular Philly or breeding right

1208
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:23,818
so siblings have the same progeny lot

1209
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:26,338
generation intimated to produce new

1210
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:27,838
generations and this is where I guess

1211
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:29,039
you can kind of see like recurrent

1212
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:30,920
selections

1213
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,318
um

1214
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,579
uh in in successive Generations

1215
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:36,779
um

1216
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,460
yeah

1217
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,519
would either if you'd like to kick us

1218
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:45,000
off on like just this this method in

1219
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:47,219
general for trying to preserve something

1220
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,318
go ahead local good luck lock something

1221
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:51,480
in I should say

1222
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,460
um so obviously we're gonna start with

1223
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,179
our seed pop right

1224
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,500
um

1225
00:46:54,179 --> 00:47:02,460
so this is something that's you know

1226
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,900
very goal oriented you you kind of have

1227
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,440
to have a goal

1228
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:11,760
to make things and move things forward

1229
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:14,760
so so you want to make sure that

1230
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,339
you have an idea where you want to go

1231
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,800
and you want to make sure that you can

1232
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:22,799
identify these traits

1233
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,940
and move those traits forward by you

1234
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,099
know

1235
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,039
in this case we're working with the

1236
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:32,338
regular population you know and this may

1237
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:36,179
be one way to do it but it isn't an

1238
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:40,400
answer and you know some people may look

1239
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:42,960
for male plants that do look you know

1240
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,358
morphologically similar to a female

1241
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,519
counterpart you know and maybe you'd

1242
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,739
cross those two together and hope that

1243
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:53,219
those progeny are going to be consistent

1244
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:57,000
for that morphological you know shape

1245
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:59,699
but also those flower morphology traits

1246
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,818
you know because yeah we do smoked flour

1247
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:05,818
and we don't grow it specifically you

1248
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:08,338
know for shape yeah but

1249
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:10,318
you know that's kind of one way you

1250
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:12,719
could maybe approach that

1251
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:16,619
um or it maybe you can

1252
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:19,139
um cross you know one narrow one broad

1253
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,260
you know and see what comes out of that

1254
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:24,719
and try to find something in between you

1255
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,920
know it depends the goal really and yeah

1256
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,838
and that would be you know in that

1257
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,039
scenario their goal would be uh

1258
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,139
something that looks quote unquote

1259
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:34,619
hybrid that would be the goal right like

1260
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:36,779
with a that case yeah for sure

1261
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:39,119
I kind of did want to ask here because I

1262
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,300
don't know about this much myself but

1263
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,880
what's the within filial breeding and

1264
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,099
generational kind of um moving things

1265
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,858
forward what is the difference between

1266
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,318
picking like one male and one female for

1267
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:54,838
each generation and picking like a few

1268
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,000
of each in each generation

1269
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,519
and when would you kind of go with one

1270
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,679
as opposed to the other

1271
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:05,579
okay so for me

1272
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,618
I don't like to do multiple pairings and

1273
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:10,140
then mixing the seeds I don't mind doing

1274
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:12,358
multiple pairings and keeping the seeds

1275
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:14,879
segregated so I know what each parent is

1276
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:16,799
offering but like in many situations

1277
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,358
when I see people doing

1278
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,280
um like multiple females and multiple

1279
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:21,900
males what they'll do is do the cross

1280
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,019
and then combine all the seeds and call

1281
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:28,200
it all one thing and to me like that's

1282
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:29,759
fine but I wouldn't do it because like

1283
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,078
each one of those different parents is

1284
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,280
going to be taking it in a slightly

1285
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,859
different Direction with different

1286
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,720
traits combining it all together would

1287
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:39,480
be calling this oh this is that line but

1288
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,358
I like in my case because I sell seeds I

1289
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,760
like my customers to know what to expect

1290
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,619
and in order to be very precise with

1291
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,000
that it to me it should always be

1292
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:49,619
one-to-one pairings but there's people

1293
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,960
who disagree with me on this it really

1294
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,640
is just a philosophical kind of

1295
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,420
standpoint for a lot of breeders where

1296
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:56,420
they stand on that

1297
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:59,700
yeah I think that's why it's such an

1298
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,099
interesting question because there's no

1299
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:04,739
right answer here um absolutely we're

1300
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,359
looking at this at trade-offs

1301
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:08,338
um

1302
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:10,199
on this like I guess this is like the

1303
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,639
difference between like mess I don't

1304
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,919
know what the right term is mass or

1305
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:17,000
group selection in Philly or breeding

1306
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,000
versus one-to-one

1307
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,720
um so let's say you're in average

1308
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,519
um seed buyer right

1309
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:29,098
and you know you're getting maybe one to

1310
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:32,159
two packs of something maybe that first

1311
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:35,160
poll You're Gonna Wanna Do a you know

1312
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,739
not an open pollination but like a some

1313
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,379
kind of selective open pollination so

1314
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:42,719
you can search through more if you

1315
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,300
genuinely have intentions of searching

1316
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,379
for something in that line yeah

1317
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,240
um

1318
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,619
so

1319
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,679
you know

1320
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,680
um

1321
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:57,000
what was the question again [ __ ]

1322
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,199
I guess like the difference between one

1323
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,480
to one

1324
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:02,759
filial breeding where you choose one

1325
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,500
male and one female

1326
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,420
um and choosing multiple males and

1327
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:10,380
females per generation

1328
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:12,720
to step forward so when you want to open

1329
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:16,260
that pool up that's when you'd maybe

1330
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:19,199
want to use uh more broader pool of

1331
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:21,720
individuals but kind of you know me

1332
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,818
after the F2 I feel like I would kind of

1333
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:26,279
just take it one direction or the other

1334
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:29,279
and nothing really in between

1335
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,319
because then like what's the point of

1336
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,000
searching through an F3 finding

1337
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:35,579
something two things that are polar

1338
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,380
opposite and then keep Crossing them you

1339
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,019
know okay I have a further prompt here

1340
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,460
like what about the situation where you

1341
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:45,500
are choosing multiples but you're

1342
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,500
choosing them for very similar traits

1343
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,079
they just wouldn't see the point

1344
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:53,460
I would just I would just take clones of

1345
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,720
one you know and just fill it through

1346
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,480
with clones of one as opposed to

1347
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:00,179
multiple so this is kind of something

1348
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,579
that I find it's um I don't want to say

1349
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:06,899
it's relevant but kind of relevant to my

1350
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:08,818
current situation is I'm growing the um

1351
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,880
Electric Boogaloo across to the

1352
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:13,800
Appalachia Appalachia Appalachia however

1353
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,760
we want to say it right what's the name

1354
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,519
of that line

1355
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,780
uh good old Mountain Dew good old

1356
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:20,280
Mountain Dew from high and Lonesome

1357
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,940
that's right

1358
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,160
um but you know it's interesting because

1359
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,920
there seems to be three you know what

1360
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:32,219
we'll call frequencies you know things

1361
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,980
that are obviously very sativa you know

1362
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:37,139
things that are somewhat you know sativa

1363
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,900
but didn't stretch as much as the things

1364
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:41,159
that were obviously very sativa and then

1365
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,079
there are these plants that didn't

1366
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,779
stretch whatsoever

1367
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,119
so now the way that I'm kind of looking

1368
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,140
at it is you kind of have these three

1369
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,480
types

1370
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:52,980
but you have to find that individual

1371
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,400
within those

1372
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:59,719
types essentially you know yeah kind of

1373
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:03,420
fulfill that purpose you know so it's

1374
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:07,259
you know it's selecting within isolated

1375
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:09,180
you know fragments within a group if I

1376
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,339
don't know yeah oh it makes sense yeah

1377
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:13,919
very interesting

1378
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:16,858
now that's super cool

1379
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,539
um that's a good good anecdote there

1380
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:19,920
okay

1381
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:22,019
um was there anything else that you two

1382
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,460
wanted to say about regular filial

1383
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:26,579
breeding

1384
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,500
otherwise um it just goes back to again

1385
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,119
knowing your starting material if you're

1386
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,739
going to do affiliate braiding like you

1387
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:34,318
want to know what you're working with

1388
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:36,299
and be be sure of what you're working

1389
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:38,579
with because your filial breeding is a

1390
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,500
several year several step long process

1391
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,420
if you want to really like take it

1392
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,519
several Generations in you don't want to

1393
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,900
go spend five years on something and be

1394
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:47,639
disappointed because you found out it

1395
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,099
has you know cropped the [ __ ] in it

1396
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:53,219
or something like that another strain

1397
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:55,318
yep yep and later on we we will we will

1398
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,838
I think um

1399
00:53:55,318 --> 00:54:00,420
get to talk about situation situations

1400
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:03,900
in which you should stop or even go back

1401
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:07,159
but um good deal for now we're gonna

1402
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:10,139
move on to a pet topic which is

1403
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:15,920
self-fulfing and using selfing to

1404
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:15,920
narrow down lock-in certain traits

1405
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,140
okay

1406
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:21,598
um

1407
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:22,858
I mean when it comes to selfing there

1408
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,079
are several different methods I think we

1409
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:27,659
talked about some of these last time in

1410
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,640
the last episode did I yeah okay yeah in

1411
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:31,379
terms of techniques yeah techniques yeah

1412
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:33,118
so you can use many of those techniques

1413
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,460
that we refer to any one of them you

1414
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,440
know whatever works best for you some

1415
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,300
people have you know amazing luck with

1416
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,800
colloidal silver I didn't

1417
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,539
um you know

1418
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,859
that's usually the one most people go to

1419
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:47,400
because it sounds the easiest to make

1420
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:49,739
but I highly recommend an STS phase

1421
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,059
um when you do reversals most of the

1422
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:53,818
time you're going to be narrowing the

1423
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,839
pull much faster or actually all the

1424
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:56,460
time you're going to be narrowing the

1425
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,380
pool much faster in a selfish situation

1426
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,240
than you would be by outcrossing

1427
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,700
obviously you're bringing in in an

1428
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,098
outcross new genetic material and even

1429
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:08,039
if it's a filial generation breeding of

1430
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:10,440
the same line by selfing you're taking

1431
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:13,318
it down it's like almost like a fast

1432
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,000
forward Game Genie type jumping through

1433
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:16,800
genetic

1434
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,539
I don't know how you say that genetic

1435
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,660
segregation well

1436
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:23,519
what's that section medical time

1437
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:25,858
yeah jumping to another time yeah

1438
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,659
genetic time machine

1439
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:30,119
um it's also much more predictable right

1440
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:32,338
than filial reading yeah I mean yeah

1441
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,440
because it's targeted specific like

1442
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:37,199
faster

1443
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,200
um segregation

1444
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,199
yeah

1445
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,300
and you know going back to the bringing

1446
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,220
bringing back like the what I was

1447
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,660
problematizing earlier with Mendel's

1448
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,098
science

1449
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,838
um I think that's one of the reasons why

1450
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:53,818
sulfing is so big in cannabis right

1451
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,619
because we don't again we don't have

1452
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:58,139
access to

1453
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:59,280
um true breeding parents a lot of the

1454
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:00,480
time

1455
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,800
um we don't have access to True reading

1456
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,280
traits

1457
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,740
um most of the time so selfing is one of

1458
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,559
the ways you can kind of get around the

1459
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,959
lack of predictability there I don't

1460
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,819
think that that is a reason that people

1461
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,699
make Femme seeds I think that is

1462
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:18,960
probably taken into account by maybe one

1463
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:21,419
percent of the people who make

1464
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,599
self-seeds uniformity or what they're

1465
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:26,338
putting out I think mostly that is it's

1466
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:28,140
popular realistically because people

1467
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:29,460
like to save space and don't like Mills

1468
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:31,078
and it's much easier for them not to

1469
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,059
look for males or learn how to select

1470
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,800
males so that's tends to be why most

1471
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:36,720
people make Femme seeds is because it

1472
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,180
sells for that reason not because uh

1473
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,759
isolating anything

1474
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:43,318
yep yep that makes sense but I guess

1475
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,599
like whether they know it or not there

1476
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:51,179
is a distinct Advantage from yes the

1477
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:53,760
other exactly yeah yeah okay that's cool

1478
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:55,558
um local anything you want to say on

1479
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,000
just like selfing in general

1480
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,800
um in this context of logging in

1481
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,838
otherwise that we have we have quite a

1482
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,740
good question

1483
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:05,159
um

1484
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:07,739
yeah I mean other than you know it gives

1485
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:09,598
you the ability to tap into certain you

1486
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:11,879
know recessives that might be desirable

1487
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,980
you know really that that is going to be

1488
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,000
the most effective way to achieve it

1489
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,460
because

1490
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,800
I guess if you're thinking about it you

1491
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,519
know at a

1492
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,960
um molecular levels you're kind of just

1493
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:27,059
stacking these things on top of each

1494
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,780
other making the chance of something

1495
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:31,700
popping up significantly higher yeah

1496
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,559
yeah

1497
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:37,139
a good way of putting it

1498
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,940
okay so we can move on to in the wins

1499
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:42,299
question and I think now I look at it uh

1500
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:47,159
maybe split into two parts first part is

1501
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:50,220
have we seen many S3

1502
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:52,440
like lines

1503
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:54,299
no

1504
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,280
yeah and why is that

1505
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,619
because once you start trying to reverse

1506
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,900
at the S2 there tends to be a lot of

1507
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:04,140
issues with reversals it S2 that we

1508
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,639
found in S2 populations and I don't we

1509
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:07,920
don't know why necessarily because we're

1510
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:09,299
not like looking at it at the molecular

1511
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,099
level we're actually just looking at it

1512
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,660
from the visual expression level I'm

1513
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:15,539
going God damn it why doesn't this work

1514
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:18,239
but realistically it kind of makes sense

1515
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:20,460
um with a as you dig into the recessives

1516
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,598
more more things are kind of scrambled

1517
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,519
and

1518
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,800
you know like some things don't reverse

1519
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,659
well some things do reverse well and for

1520
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,640
some reason the more you inbreed the

1521
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:31,318
less likely things are looking to

1522
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,858
reverse well at least with the lines

1523
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:33,858
we've done

1524
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:37,440
yeah that makes sense I mean

1525
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,900
um

1526
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,179
as you inbreed further you are

1527
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,318
endangering essentially the fitness of

1528
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:45,838
the

1529
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,480
um the material right and and the and

1530
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,519
The Offspring

1531
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,139
yeah and if Auto Zones are controlling

1532
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:54,000
some of this um

1533
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:56,639
even though you know AutoZone's with a

1534
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,960
non-sexual chromosomes even though they

1535
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,940
are not sexual they might be helping

1536
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,920
control some of that

1537
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:04,679
so there's a lot

1538
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,298
in in selfieing with the recessives and

1539
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:07,558
that is just there's a lot of

1540
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:09,239
variability a lot of things that could

1541
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:10,680
be controlling it I don't personally

1542
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,479
understand I'm not a scientist and like

1543
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:15,058
I know we said at the beginning but

1544
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,099
again I am far from a scientist I am

1545
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:20,640
very lame in service where's my my buddy

1546
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:22,798
local here actually went to school you

1547
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:25,440
know like that's not me so I I may be

1548
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:28,019
using some odd words to people apologies

1549
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,280
to the science Community for destroying

1550
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:31,280
everything I'm saying yeah

1551
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:34,199
okay

1552
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:35,760
um local anything you want to add to

1553
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:37,259
that otherwise I can move on to the next

1554
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,079
part of the question

1555
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,420
um so yeah so Matt was saying that you

1556
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:46,019
know you're obviously you know stacking

1557
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:50,760
these jeans on top of each other

1558
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:53,818
um so you know it's kind of like fast

1559
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,880
forwarding in genetic time you know a

1560
00:59:53,818 --> 01:00:00,119
few Generations so we know that this

1561
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,460
isn't at the extreme of an F2 this is

1562
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,760
you know something more and more

1563
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,920
isolated and so as you isolate these

1564
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,440
things more deleterious alleles have

1565
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,139
higher chances of popping up and you

1566
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,380
know things you know not reversing past

1567
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:18,480
S2 could be just a symptom of inbreeding

1568
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,000
depression you know through Rapid

1569
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,699
breathing and like I said it may be the

1570
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,559
the things we were selecting as well you

1571
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:28,139
know to choose to do I mean maybe if you

1572
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,940
took like uh let's say a super mega

1573
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:32,039
polyhyper like animal mints like if you

1574
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,440
go on seedfinder for example and look at

1575
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,239
the tree like it's like 90 feet long

1576
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,639
because it's just a bunch of poly hybrid

1577
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,558
stacked on each other maybe in that case

1578
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,358
taking that to S2 might have a higher

1579
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,380
chance of reversals because it's just so

1580
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:45,380
many you know

1581
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:52,280
you know and

1582
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:55,260
uh obviously some of these um you know

1583
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:57,119
depressions you know that we see aren't

1584
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:00,119
always going to be physical traits you

1585
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:03,240
know exactly one of crybaby's big things

1586
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:06,480
are uh plant hormones and whatnot you

1587
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:08,939
know and that can that obviously has so

1588
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,099
much to do with why the plant does

1589
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,740
pretty much all the [ __ ] it does so like

1590
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:16,079
yeah it not reversing might just mean

1591
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:17,399
that it doesn't have the genetic

1592
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,220
capability

1593
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:24,200
to reduce said levels of hormones or

1594
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:24,199
regulate you know that exactly

1595
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:30,118
cool very nice

1596
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:31,739
okay so I'll reframe the next part of in

1597
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,000
the wind's question

1598
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:34,979
um to say

1599
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,920
uh because as as you mentioned now we're

1600
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:40,440
not we haven't really seen S3s but

1601
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,858
have we seen many instances of uh S2s or

1602
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,338
s1s being crossed and yes what's the

1603
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:46,338
vibe there

1604
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:51,298
um yeah I know that me and CSI like we

1605
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:55,740
found some of our best stuff in like a

1606
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:58,858
in self-sisters crossed to each other so

1607
01:01:55,739 --> 01:02:01,679
um let's say you pop uh a pack of for

1608
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:04,440
example California Orange s1s we would

1609
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:06,298
take uh one selection that we really

1610
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,159
liked from the California oranges ones

1611
01:02:06,298 --> 01:02:09,838
and we find another selection that we

1612
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,539
really like for another reason from the

1613
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,759
California before oranges ones and when

1614
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,980
we cross those we won't necessarily be

1615
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,559
getting what's called an S2 because it's

1616
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:21,539
not it's not necessarily self would be

1617
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,339
using the same exact expression onto

1618
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:25,679
itself but this is two different

1619
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:28,798
expressions from the same line me and

1620
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:30,960
CSI refer to this as an F2 reversal and

1621
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,039
in it's not necessarily the proper

1622
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,720
terminology it's not scientific

1623
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,699
terminology but we needed something to

1624
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:37,259
denote like what we're doing and what

1625
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:37,980
stage we're at and it's not necessarily

1626
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,859
self

1627
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,838
it is technically a filial generation of

1628
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:45,000
sorts and it's a reversal and I like

1629
01:02:42,838 --> 01:02:46,500
denoting reversals so people understand

1630
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,940
that something was reversed in the

1631
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,420
process so that they understand that

1632
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:53,400
it's more narrow as it were than using

1633
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,338
like you know other material outcross

1634
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,139
but in that sense like we are I can

1635
01:02:56,338 --> 01:03:00,298
think of so many examples

1636
01:02:58,139 --> 01:03:02,400
um where we're crossing two sisters two

1637
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:04,559
sisters from the same line in a in a

1638
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,760
little generation just brings out

1639
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,339
amazingness

1640
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,619
um a great example would be bitter when

1641
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:12,000
he took my p91 s1s and found two

1642
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:15,358
selections he liked from that and made

1643
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,599
the p91 f2r I believe it's called and it

1644
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:20,159
it seriously was so much better than the

1645
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:21,599
original starting material it was so

1646
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,078
much better than anything I saw on the

1647
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,480
s1s and um yeah and it's not uncommon

1648
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,760
for that to happen in these uh feminized

1649
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,818
hybrids

1650
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,980
yeah it's basically oh go go ahead man

1651
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:36,838
no local you do it

1652
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,519
um oh I was just gonna say that it you

1653
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:42,000
know it's pretty cool to kind of grow

1654
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:44,519
those lines out because it kind of like

1655
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,500
how do I say this it locks things in

1656
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:49,858
while opening

1657
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:52,019
things up in a way yeah it sounds

1658
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:54,298
counterintuitive but that's almost what

1659
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:56,639
it does because like the sweet pea for

1660
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:58,798
example like everything had copious

1661
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,659
amounts of resin like yeah you know

1662
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:04,559
everything

1663
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:07,679
um smells you know two kind of smells I

1664
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:10,079
guess yeah really yeah soapy and then

1665
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,440
one that was really nutty you know

1666
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:17,099
exactly yeah literally so at that point

1667
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:20,519
it was just picking a plant that vibed

1668
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:23,160
with you really yeah so I I think those

1669
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:25,079
are really fun lines to hunt because you

1670
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,298
can kind of um

1671
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:29,760
how do I say this um I don't think

1672
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:32,880
personalize it is is really the way to

1673
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:38,339
put it but kind of adapt it to your your

1674
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:40,440
environment yeah yeah you know

1675
01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:42,719
and then there's also you know like the

1676
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,000
the feminized hybrids where it's not

1677
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,098
sisters and it's two different clones

1678
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,358
Crossing and we've also found amazing

1679
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:49,980
stuff in there

1680
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:52,139
um I tend to like the sister to sister

1681
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,179
more than just the um two different

1682
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:56,338
lines because that is more of a let's

1683
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:57,899
see what happens type scenario for the

1684
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:58,798
most part with the the clone of clones

1685
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,500
but

1686
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,480
um I mean like for that example the the

1687
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,039
uh reverse train wreck onto the Santa

1688
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,539
Cruz blue dream I think that's become

1689
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,880
one of the favorites in our group you

1690
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:11,219
know what I mean like and this is it was

1691
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,798
better than either parent in my opinion

1692
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:16,139
on their own combined it made for

1693
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,519
something better than both parents which

1694
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:19,519
is it's not always common

1695
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:25,259
yep and I guess to bring it back to the

1696
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,619
um this section on like narrowing

1697
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,480
locking in would y'all say that selfing

1698
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:32,160
and I don't know if I'm wrenching the

1699
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,079
science here but would jail say that

1700
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,659
something

1701
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,039
um gives us a a bit of chance of

1702
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:39,420
actually having something that's true of

1703
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,960
reading

1704
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,960
yes

1705
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:45,180
yeah

1706
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:48,420
generally speaking yes

1707
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:49,019
yeah cool yeah

1708
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:53,338
um

1709
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:55,559
okay and maybe the last question uh last

1710
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:57,960
part of this question is and you kind of

1711
01:05:55,559 --> 01:06:03,420
alluded to this when you cross

1712
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:06,420
two s ones do you do you expect a

1713
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:08,400
um a little boost in Vigor all right is

1714
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:11,420
that a way to offset some of this

1715
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,420
inbreeding depression

1716
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:18,240
yes I and I'll say just anecdotally

1717
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:21,118
specifically with the p91 one p91 was

1718
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,558
very very very uh the reason it was

1719
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,660
given to me is because the dude who had

1720
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,700
it the very last cut he was like this is

1721
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:28,739
dying on me and there was no Vigor left

1722
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,358
in it there was really no resin

1723
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:35,159
production left

1724
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:37,798
um it definitely restored Vigor to an

1725
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:39,719
almost obsolete cut so in that sense yes

1726
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:43,759
I mean like the line we have a vigorous

1727
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:43,759
line that represents p91 very well

1728
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,659
nice

1729
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:52,440
anything you want to add to that local

1730
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:53,519
um um not that I can think of

1731
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,679
okay

1732
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,838
that's cool well is there anything else

1733
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:01,739
we want to say about selfing in the

1734
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:03,838
context of uh locking in uh

1735
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:05,759
just that it's the most effective for me

1736
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:11,338
in my opinion it's the most effective

1737
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:12,599
way of of breeding to lock in traits

1738
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:15,599
um

1739
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:17,400
however it can be done with Mills as

1740
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,420
effectively it's sometimes it's a lot

1741
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,460
more luck or a lot more experiential uh

1742
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:26,940
knowledge though

1743
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:28,980
yep yep and while we haven't really been

1744
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:32,400
constraining this conversation to be

1745
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:34,318
about breeding at smaller scales I think

1746
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,119
those of you who are interested in that

1747
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:37,199
you can already see what the advantages

1748
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:39,000
are

1749
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,259
in absolutely using something like

1750
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,599
selfing

1751
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,220
um if you don't have that much time

1752
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,619
space numbers

1753
01:07:44,219 --> 01:07:49,439
when I did the most of my stuffing work

1754
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:51,180
was when I was uh blowing up Apartments

1755
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,519
like multiple Apartments because it was

1756
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:55,259
small spaces like obviously I could

1757
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:57,119
knock down walls in these apartments so

1758
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:59,099
I could like join them together and make

1759
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,260
a bigger space out of it so there's a

1760
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:03,420
lot of different small spaces with low

1761
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:06,539
electricity loads in those old ass

1762
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:07,980
Apartments so I I did a lot of selfing

1763
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:10,140
during those years and it was highly

1764
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:13,019
effective highly effective way of doing

1765
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:16,798
small space breeding

1766
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:18,539
nice nice I think that will be a juicy

1767
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:22,019
morsel for a lot of people

1768
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:23,819
well McKay I guess well I will add a

1769
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:26,160
color

1770
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:28,140
um is you know if you're a first time

1771
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,119
breeder it might not be the worst idea

1772
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:32,699
to kind of start with that because it

1773
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:34,679
gives you an accurate measure of what

1774
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:36,899
you're actually working with like you

1775
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:39,239
have direct

1776
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:42,000
you know representation of

1777
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:43,738
something that may be expressed in the

1778
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,798
process that's a good way of putting it

1779
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:49,379
something that maybe expressed me

1780
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:53,460
very nice I love that

1781
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:55,020
okay now we've gone to another I

1782
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,439
wouldn't say a favorite topic but maybe

1783
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:02,279
like a pet peeve more than anything yeah

1784
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:05,460
we have back Crossing now yeah I will

1785
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:08,100
say this I think I can say that

1786
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:10,739
for whatever reason there's a common

1787
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,239
misconception that back Crossing is just

1788
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:14,698
about

1789
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,399
um locking stuff in

1790
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:18,659
but in actuality it's a little bit more

1791
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,059
the context for is a bit more

1792
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:25,079
complicated than that yeah um back

1793
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:28,080
Crossing in in in proper terms is you

1794
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:30,179
trying to incorporate a single trait a

1795
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:33,960
single new trait into a recurrent parent

1796
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:37,798
that's already stable that's the real

1797
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:40,198
function of back Crossing correct and if

1798
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:42,000
we go back to the idea that the

1799
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:43,919
likelihood of you having a true breeding

1800
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,159
recurrent parent

1801
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,798
is already very low super low

1802
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:52,798
it already kind of partly undermines

1803
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:55,319
this whole Enterprise one yes and two

1804
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:57,300
the possibility of you having another

1805
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:58,619
true breeding parent that's true reading

1806
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,140
for this one trait that you're trying to

1807
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:04,738
bring in to the other parent is also

1808
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:07,619
extremely low yeah so to me we're kind

1809
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:09,599
of I think that's why back Crossing as a

1810
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:11,519
concept in cannabis is so confused is

1811
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,860
because one people misunderstand what it

1812
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,780
actually is meant to do and number two

1813
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:19,579
people don't even have the correct

1814
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:19,579
starting conditions to do it correct

1815
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,039
um so that's that's how I wanted to

1816
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,820
introduce that

1817
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:25,738
um

1818
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,000
is there anything y'all would add to

1819
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:28,198
this because I know that there are lots

1820
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,960
of anecdotes

1821
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:33,899
um about like people's myths about bad

1822
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,119
Crossing in Canada's yeah

1823
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:38,460
um so one of the the biggest examples

1824
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:40,738
given or the most common used examples

1825
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:44,279
of back Crossing being massively

1826
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:45,839
successful is Cinderella 99.

1827
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:47,880
um it was some of the first examples in

1828
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,300
cannabis of people saying like check out

1829
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:54,359
my work this is vx1 and this is actually

1830
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:57,119
like 33 Cinder you know princess and

1831
01:10:54,359 --> 01:11:00,059
this one is 75 princess and this one's

1832
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,979
actually 99 princess so since the

1833
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,520
genetics have been back crossed this

1834
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:06,718
many times of course it's going to be 99

1835
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,800
princess you're always going to see

1836
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,439
princess

1837
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:13,140
and in theory that sounds great in

1838
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:16,139
practicality it did not work at all c99

1839
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:19,140
has many many phenos and expressions and

1840
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:20,520
traits and it's it's pretty broad it's

1841
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,440
pretty broad now there are some that

1842
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,960
occur more regularly like the grapefruit

1843
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:26,939
pineapple but there's a lot more than

1844
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,000
that in there and to me it was a fine

1845
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:32,879
example of how back Crossing is used

1846
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,579
incorrectly understood like totally

1847
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:39,119
misunderstood like calling it like a 99

1848
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:41,279
princess that's not how cannabis works

1849
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,779
just like these simple crosses and no

1850
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,460
matter what you use as long as you're

1851
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:46,380
just back Crossing

1852
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:49,619
you're you're going to get 99 that's not

1853
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,940
how that's not how [ __ ] works so

1854
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:53,158
um you know most people throw that out

1855
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:56,698
as an as an example of how bat Crossing

1856
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:59,039
was A-Okay successful and to me it was

1857
01:11:56,698 --> 01:12:00,960
like the opposite like the the perfect

1858
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,119
proof of why

1859
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,739
um a perfect example of how

1860
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,300
misunderstood that crossing of the

1861
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:07,738
cannabis

1862
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,920
yeah

1863
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:13,379
um I you know I really don't think that

1864
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,980
there is a need to go really past the

1865
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,600
first back cross really you know because

1866
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:21,000
again

1867
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,940
in a back cross you should really know

1868
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
the starting material so you know let's

1869
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:29,000
take um Blue Bonnet for example you know

1870
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,039
it's something that's extremely stable

1871
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,679
and it's something that you know

1872
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:36,899
it I would feel confident using it in a

1873
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:39,840
background because like it just has

1874
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:42,539
visible traits that like you know you

1875
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,119
can link yeah as we were kind of

1876
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:47,219
chatting about earlier so it's like if

1877
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,260
that plant is stable then in that first

1878
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:52,079
generation you should be able to find

1879
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:56,100
what you want you know yes

1880
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:58,859
if you're getting more than what you

1881
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,380
want like do you even know what like

1882
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:02,819
genes you're targeting is there a goal

1883
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:05,819
in mind you know

1884
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:08,158
it it's a little more complex than just

1885
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:10,500
hitting the reoccurrent parent or

1886
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:13,319
whatever each time and I'll add into

1887
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:16,020
like in in the theory of back Crossing

1888
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:17,158
we are trying usually usually like when

1889
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,900
I'm doing a back cross especially like

1890
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:20,158
blue bonnet let's say blue bonnet the X1

1891
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:21,238
right

1892
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,839
um

1893
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:28,139
I am trying to find an outcross parent

1894
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:30,480
that is going to bring more stability to

1895
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:33,239
what I'm looking for so I'm not

1896
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,919
necessarily in a bx1 gonna go wild with

1897
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:37,259
the outcross or go something like

1898
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,359
totally opposite unless the trade I'm

1899
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:40,679
looking for is something in that and I

1900
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:42,259
know that's true reading too and it

1901
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:44,279
could absolutely bring that trade over

1902
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,960
if you take something completely

1903
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:47,340
different and bring it into your back

1904
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,939
cross

1905
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,400
um

1906
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:52,139
it can go any number of ways any number

1907
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:53,819
of ways and you're not effectively back

1908
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,960
Crossing at that point you know just

1909
01:13:53,819 --> 01:13:57,420
kind of playing

1910
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,619
yeah yeah and I was I'll kind of

1911
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:01,679
paraphrase this a little differently

1912
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:03,719
which is that often in cannabis your

1913
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,760
individual plant that is you want to use

1914
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,500
as a recurring parent the individual

1915
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,820
plant that you want to use as the like I

1916
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:12,420
think they call it like introgressive

1917
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:13,979
parent they're likely to be largely

1918
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:16,260
um heterozygous

1919
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:19,500
yeah and if you are using heterozygous

1920
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:21,600
material you're not going to get the

1921
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:24,179
predicted results based on the model of

1922
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,400
that cross that that's just yeah that's

1923
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:27,359
just how it works

1924
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,559
um

1925
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:31,380
is there anything else you want to say

1926
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,140
about back Crossing um have we seen many

1927
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:37,739
successful examples of it in the market

1928
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:41,780
I would say I would say

1929
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:41,779
um it's a good example of a bx1

1930
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:49,019
I I'm not using myself but I I can't you

1931
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:50,579
know what exactly I'll say an example of

1932
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:54,120
um

1933
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:56,219
let's see a failed bx1 Maybe

1934
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:57,779
for my own

1935
01:14:56,219 --> 01:15:01,319
um

1936
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:04,500
um so with the Platinum banana OGB X1 I

1937
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:06,059
used a uh outcross it was a long time

1938
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,679
ago and I hate even admitting this it

1939
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:11,699
was an outcross of cookies and cream

1940
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:15,060
banana OG and my my goal was to keep it

1941
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:17,219
banana OG dominant and

1942
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:19,260
it looked good in some of the crosses

1943
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:20,880
but what I found was that cookies and

1944
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:24,480
cream tended to dominate it and it was

1945
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:27,600
the outcross but it was so dominant and

1946
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,759
so different that it really brought too

1947
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,100
much variability into what I was trying

1948
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,079
to do so I feel like that a lot of those

1949
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,400
while they were they were decent and

1950
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:37,979
they made great lines and there was

1951
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:40,559
banana popping out a ton it wasn't what

1952
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:43,099
I wanted from a bx1 line so I consider

1953
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,100
it a failure

1954
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:48,299
yeah yeah

1955
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,679
thank you for that

1956
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,239
okay I figure it's easier to throw

1957
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,658
myself under the bus than other people

1958
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:56,039
it's less fun someone else

1959
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:57,658
yeah because I think in many ways you

1960
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:59,460
could probably think of many bad crosses

1961
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:01,379
that are not you know not definitely not

1962
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:03,658
it I could think about 30 off the top of

1963
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:06,420
my head I'll keep myself yeah yeah we

1964
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:08,039
won't go there we won't go there okay so

1965
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,039
we're getting close to the end of this

1966
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:13,500
section on like an overview of various

1967
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:16,380
techniques for both

1968
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,119
um widening and narrowing

1969
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,800
um local I don't know at this point it's

1970
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:23,698
kind of it doesn't really fit anywhere

1971
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,100
but I wondered if you wanted to

1972
01:16:23,698 --> 01:16:29,219
say anything about population-based

1973
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:33,320
breeding like as a concept

1974
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:33,319
um and how it may or may not fit

1975
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:40,559
um so I'll start with um cannabis is you

1976
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:43,559
know we're really fortunate to be able

1977
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:46,800
to hold on to things in vegetative state

1978
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,880
for [ __ ] ever essentially yes

1979
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,060
um so

1980
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,560
that in itself kind of eliminates the

1981
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:55,580
need

1982
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,580
um to uh

1983
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:03,539
um that that really uh defeats the need

1984
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:06,500
to um

1985
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:10,019
damn I I lost myself

1986
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:14,960
a nice one Matt nice one bro

1987
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:18,600
um more editing yes so um since uh

1988
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,698
since uh since we do uh have the ability

1989
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,579
to keep things around for an indefinite

1990
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:25,979
amount of time you know Theory

1991
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:28,439
um it it doesn't

1992
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:31,619
really push us to study populations

1993
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:33,479
because we can just hold this thing onto

1994
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:35,880
you for the rest of our lives

1995
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:38,519
you know which is cool we're very

1996
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:40,640
fortunate to have but what happens in

1997
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:44,280
the instance that we lose these things

1998
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,920
yes you know I think there should kind

1999
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:50,880
of be a push for population type reading

2000
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:53,520
so that you can recover that thing that

2001
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:56,579
has been lost you know and population

2002
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,800
type could obviously you know include S1

2003
01:17:56,579 --> 01:18:00,658
type breeding yeah

2004
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,779
um you know because at the end of it

2005
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:05,759
your s1s are gonna be a population you

2006
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:08,039
know a group

2007
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,380
uh can I just be basic here and kind of

2008
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:12,719
ask you to even like just outline what

2009
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,279
what population breeding is

2010
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,100
yeah

2011
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:20,698
um so I mean that's just gonna take into

2012
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:23,760
kind of um consideration into kind of

2013
01:18:20,698 --> 01:18:24,479
like um selection you know

2014
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,360
um

2015
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:29,158
you have to weed things out to improve

2016
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:32,698
the population and move things forward

2017
01:18:29,158 --> 01:18:36,119
you know that in agriculture I feel like

2018
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:39,479
a lot of the breeding has been

2019
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:42,359
um forward and hasn't really focused on

2020
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:45,779
conserving things but in moving things

2021
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:47,639
forward there is progression but at the

2022
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:49,079
loss of

2023
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,420
you know

2024
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:54,140
certain genes that maybe we can't

2025
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,140
recover anymore

2026
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,679
yep

2027
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:02,219
um have we seen so would you say that

2028
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:03,779
like and maybe maybe I'm just

2029
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:05,698
reiterating an earlier point that was

2030
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:06,238
already made but

2031
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:08,219
um

2032
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:10,738
would you say that most of traditional

2033
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:12,060
reading and cannabis

2034
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:14,759
um

2035
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,380
has been population breeding like you

2036
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,940
know pre-modern I guess is what I'm

2037
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,719
saying

2038
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:21,119
um

2039
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,219
I mean I I couldn't really say because I

2040
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,679
I don't I really don't know like kind of

2041
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:28,619
the whole anthropology of like Old World

2042
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:31,260
cannabis and how it turned off the world

2043
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:34,099
and I don't want to make stories up

2044
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:34,100
um why

2045
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:39,119
yeah okay yeah okay well then then this

2046
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,919
would just be a gesture towards this

2047
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:43,198
other kind of possibility I think we

2048
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,760
won't go too deep into it but yeah it's

2049
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:48,379
an interesting point to make I think

2050
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:52,079
nonetheless yeah okay so

2051
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:54,060
we I think for me this is kind of the

2052
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,679
end of this overview of breeding

2053
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,420
techniques and strategies and I wanted

2054
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,239
to move into this section on what makes

2055
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:02,279
breeding so high but

2056
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:06,658
I think a good segue here is something

2057
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:08,340
that we've obviously uh talked uh

2058
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:10,679
implicitly about but we haven't actually

2059
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:14,159
addressed it in and of itself which is

2060
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:16,619
making selections

2061
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:18,539
uh yes obviously an integral part of

2062
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:22,019
reading

2063
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:25,859
um and yeah I mean where do we even

2064
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:28,140
begin with I want people to start I want

2065
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:30,238
people to start like maybe I shouldn't

2066
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:35,219
say I want people to start this is how I

2067
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:38,339
think of my plants in in a reading

2068
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:39,899
context I think of each individual plant

2069
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,880
and I'm not talking about strains I'm

2070
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:45,000
talking about each individual plant as a

2071
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:48,239
tool and each tool has a different set

2072
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,319
of traits so when I go and and plan a

2073
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:52,559
project

2074
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:53,698
I'm I'm considering what traits I have

2075
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,980
available

2076
01:20:53,698 --> 01:20:57,658
and I'm also considering where I would

2077
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:58,439
like to go and a lot of times I don't

2078
01:20:57,658 --> 01:21:00,899
even

2079
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:03,319
necessarily consider what I have

2080
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:06,479
available I think of something like

2081
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:09,479
cinnamon for example just a single Cent

2082
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:11,819
a single trade I want cinnamon how can I

2083
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:14,059
how could I come up with that with the

2084
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:17,219
tools I have available is it possible

2085
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:19,440
how many steps would it take

2086
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:22,140
um things like that is but mostly is it

2087
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:25,139
possible and if it's not reassess my

2088
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:28,140
goals or

2089
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:29,520
um find plants that I know will get me

2090
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,719
to the goal

2091
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,199
so

2092
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:35,760
I think of each plant like a tool in

2093
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:37,198
that sensor like a brush a different

2094
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,300
brush you can use to paint a different

2095
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:41,839
picture in other words

2096
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,840
yeah yeah

2097
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,340
um it's a funny one because I often I

2098
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:49,259
see questions where people are like how

2099
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:51,179
do you select and it's like sure you

2100
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:53,100
know you we can give principles but this

2101
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:55,380
is really where it does become more

2102
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,699
about the art right because absolutely I

2103
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,760
think like both of you alluded to

2104
01:21:56,698 --> 01:22:02,698
earlier like so much of it is about what

2105
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,440
you yourself want need what your

2106
01:22:02,698 --> 01:22:08,399
environmental pressures are dictating

2107
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:10,799
for you what your starting material

2108
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:12,299
um is already constraining you to so

2109
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,900
it's not there isn't really a silver

2110
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:18,119
bullet for selection and there isn't

2111
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:19,859
really like a casual answer there is

2112
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:21,300
also one other thing that we haven't

2113
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:25,019
really discussed and that's the

2114
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:28,219
invariable or and intangibles the

2115
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:31,800
intangible traits of smoking effect

2116
01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:34,439
smoking for effect this is a trait that

2117
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,800
is not just intangible meaning we can't

2118
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:39,119
you can't necessarily touch it feel it

2119
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,760
observe it with all your most of your

2120
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:43,380
senses right your your it's a sense yeah

2121
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,900
it's a whole different sense that we

2122
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:46,619
don't really normally tap into

2123
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:49,139
um

2124
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:51,359
and it's individual it's not just

2125
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:53,880
individual per person it's individual

2126
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,619
percent and setting so you can have

2127
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,179
different effects from the same exact

2128
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:59,399
growth the same exact strain the same

2129
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:01,260
exact bud in the same exact pipe and not

2130
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:03,359
finish the bowl and get a completely

2131
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:04,619
different effect from it

2132
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,019
um at a different time in the day let's

2133
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:08,579
say you're you're really stressed and

2134
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,960
versus when you were earlier that

2135
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:11,399
morning you were totally you know in a

2136
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:14,219
good mood blah blah blah smoking

2137
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:15,899
everything's fine happy chilling you get

2138
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:17,340
home from work you're super stressed

2139
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:19,139
you've got a lot of caffeine that day

2140
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,640
and you smoke and it's a completely

2141
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,760
different effect now you're getting more

2142
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:26,520
anxiety now you're getting more paranoia

2143
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:28,260
effect is is the intangible it's one of

2144
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,179
the most in my opinion one of the most

2145
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:32,880
important parts of breeding for in

2146
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:35,279
cannabis and probably the hardest to

2147
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:38,119
quantify so I wanted to definitely bring

2148
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:38,119
that up at this point

2149
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:45,420
yeah for sure and I think when we were

2150
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:46,319
talking yesterday in preparation for

2151
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:49,619
this

2152
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:51,658
you also mentioned like

2153
01:23:49,619 --> 01:23:54,300
you wanted to talk about applying proper

2154
01:23:51,658 --> 01:23:56,759
observation techniques

2155
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:58,619
um and controlling variables and

2156
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,960
ensuring that

2157
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:03,539
everything that you observe

2158
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,480
is relative to stable you know

2159
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,560
observational conditions and I guess

2160
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:09,419
that's another key part of making

2161
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,300
selections is like how consistently are

2162
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:14,100
you growing these these plants you know

2163
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,880
um how consistent is your environment

2164
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,920
Etc

2165
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:19,079
yeah I I touched on that earlier another

2166
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,359
thing like seed buyers don't usually

2167
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:23,760
take into account that I think is also

2168
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,319
very important and as a breeder I take

2169
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,179
this into account when I'm making seeds

2170
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:29,880
and who I sell the seeds to and how I

2171
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:31,980
sell them to them is where are your

2172
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,659
seeds being made

2173
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:36,299
um or who are you breeding for who's

2174
01:24:33,658 --> 01:24:37,738
your target audience more more that's

2175
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,659
more important who's your target

2176
01:24:37,738 --> 01:24:41,399
audience is this Siege you're going to

2177
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:43,738
be sharing with your friends are these

2178
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:45,238
seeds you're making for yourself

2179
01:24:43,738 --> 01:24:48,359
um

2180
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:50,099
indoor seeds made indoor for indoor

2181
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:53,460
people is great

2182
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:55,620
seeds made indoor tend to do well for

2183
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:58,859
outdoor they tend to do well going

2184
01:24:55,619 --> 01:25:00,719
outdoor however seeds made outdoor don't

2185
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:02,039
always do well like let's say I'm a

2186
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:05,039
breeder and I'm making all my seeds

2187
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:06,539
outdoor and my customers are 90 indoor

2188
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,340
that's where you're going to see a lot

2189
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:10,140
of problems with people saying man this

2190
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:11,600
stuff keeps hurting you know it's

2191
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:13,400
completely different

2192
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:16,620
environments where they've been

2193
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:18,658
acclimated completely different and

2194
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:21,300
that's a super important part to

2195
01:25:18,658 --> 01:25:23,158
consider so who is your audience and

2196
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,420
again who is your audience how serious

2197
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:25,679
are you going to take this if it's just

2198
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,539
for you and your friends are you going

2199
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,920
to worry about pollen contamination as

2200
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,658
much as you would if you're selling

2201
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,460
these seeds where people are paying good

2202
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:34,559
money for them and these are customers

2203
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,658
that you want to keep very happy or is

2204
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,699
it just your friends the target audience

2205
01:25:36,658 --> 01:25:39,960
is another super important part when

2206
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:43,859
you're going through your reading goals

2207
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,300
and what I'm Who is my intended user end

2208
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:46,738
user of the scenes

2209
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,300
yeah and I guess I'll point out

2210
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,759
something really obvious which is that

2211
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:53,340
your breeding goals obviously will at

2212
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,920
least majorly dictate your selections

2213
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:57,300
yes right and if they're not lined up in

2214
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,219
something's obviously wrong yeah

2215
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:01,020
something just disappointedly obvious

2216
01:25:59,219 --> 01:26:04,198
just to point out the obvious

2217
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:06,600
yeah um okay so just to zoom out a bit

2218
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:08,099
and just re-situate us when what we're

2219
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,560
talking about right now this is kind of

2220
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,120
more of a summary section and kind of

2221
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,860
trying to situate

2222
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:15,719
um some of the principles and techniques

2223
01:26:13,859 --> 01:26:17,939
we've already outlined in a more

2224
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:20,520
practical sense and and kind of

2225
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:22,500
address this this question of like what

2226
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,560
are all the complexities and nuances of

2227
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:28,679
breeding and so we've covered like why

2228
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:31,620
we can't straightforwardly apply uh the

2229
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:33,179
science we've covered the difficulties

2230
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:36,000
in actually knowing your starting

2231
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:37,739
material in all your planets we've

2232
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,800
covered applying you know proper

2233
01:26:37,738 --> 01:26:42,539
observation techniques and uh Matt just

2234
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,400
addressed like the complexities and

2235
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:47,399
setting even goals for yourself when

2236
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:50,039
you're breeding so I think one really

2237
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:53,099
big one that is worth talking about when

2238
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:55,380
it comes to difficulty is just how much

2239
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:57,420
time and how expensive this whole

2240
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,980
endeavor

2241
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:01,139
can be

2242
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:02,579
sure

2243
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:05,159
it's uh

2244
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:06,600
you know and and I thought about this a

2245
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:08,158
lot in other episodes but when it comes

2246
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,940
to reversals

2247
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,559
um

2248
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:12,419
early on there wasn't a lot of us doing

2249
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,760
them in the United States and it was

2250
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,960
often called like we the few of us that

2251
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,579
were doing it we're you know you're

2252
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,139
taking the cheap route you're taking the

2253
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:21,238
the easy route that's the shortcut

2254
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:22,859
that's all this that but realistically

2255
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:25,439
like there's so much failure in

2256
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:27,899
reversals and um that it is very

2257
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:29,698
expensive it and it takes a lot of time

2258
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:32,460
if you fail at a reversal and you don't

2259
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:34,439
have a backup and and keeping backups is

2260
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,300
tricky because that's when you may

2261
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:38,039
encounter pollen contamination if you

2262
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,900
don't time it correctly or have it

2263
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:42,179
spaced out right

2264
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:45,960
um it's a very expensive process whether

2265
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:48,000
you're doing male to female or feminized

2266
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,639
but I found it much much much more

2267
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,219
expensive and costly with feminization

2268
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,859
only because of the failure rate it's

2269
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:58,859
very easy not to fail as far as pollen

2270
01:27:55,859 --> 01:28:01,019
taking in male to female breeding but in

2271
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:03,479
actually doing breeding when I'm also

2272
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,639
saying failure it's did you meet your

2273
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:07,559
goal and that's another part where it

2274
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:09,779
can get very expensive if you're very

2275
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:11,580
goal oriented and you haven't end goal

2276
01:28:09,779 --> 01:28:13,380
and you're sticking to it and you're and

2277
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:16,380
you're working to that goal no matter

2278
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:19,079
what it takes time it takes money it

2279
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:20,460
takes space space is important the more

2280
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:22,079
numbers you run the better the chance

2281
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,460
you are of finding something you'd like

2282
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:24,960
to use

2283
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,460
um so yeah

2284
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,198
I think that's a really good distinction

2285
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:30,359
as well like there's they're the fail

2286
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:33,479
the kind of like mechanical failures and

2287
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:34,859
execution of the techniques or steps and

2288
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:36,919
then they're the failures to actually

2289
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:38,698
meet goals and those are actually quite

2290
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,340
distinct although of course they're

2291
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:46,079
connected yeah um

2292
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:46,980
so we had a we had a question here about

2293
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:49,679
um

2294
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:53,099
no so this is from farmer Dan and I know

2295
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:55,319
we had an example uh he asked

2296
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,120
how do you know when to work a line and

2297
01:28:55,319 --> 01:29:00,599
when to leave it alone like when do you

2298
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:02,519
stop go back instead of just pressing on

2299
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,320
um and I think you two mentioned to me

2300
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,440
you know like hi and Lonesome you know

2301
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:09,840
had had to go back with his Appalachia

2302
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:12,359
yeah and it's one of those things that

2303
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,460
like you know a lot of people talk about

2304
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:17,698
this when not a lot of people actually

2305
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:20,219
go back multiple generations and take

2306
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:22,138
the time or even make the observations

2307
01:29:20,219 --> 01:29:24,600
like I've run enough of this stuff

2308
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:26,279
myself and I've decided this isn't a

2309
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,420
good representation of what I wanted to

2310
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:29,340
put out there I'm not going to release

2311
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:32,340
these I'm going to go ahead and go back

2312
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:34,079
to the F2 when I'm already at F5 so

2313
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,340
three generations take it back I'm gonna

2314
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:37,380
go ahead and start back here the last

2315
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,159
time I saw a population I'm really happy

2316
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,139
with

2317
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,819
and I'm gonna see if I can reselect this

2318
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:43,199
and there's so few times I've seen this

2319
01:29:41,819 --> 01:29:45,840
and especially when someone's worked

2320
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:48,359
something up to F5 jump back to F2 work

2321
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:52,020
it back up in that direction

2322
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:53,759
um but it's a trait of a real breeder it

2323
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:56,340
is the absolute trait of a real breeder

2324
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,900
to be that goal oriented and like I said

2325
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:59,159
it's not very common and that's one of

2326
01:29:57,899 --> 01:30:00,899
the major reasons I look up to

2327
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:02,339
highlights of so much is because he is

2328
01:30:00,899 --> 01:30:03,420
that goal-oriented willing to do the

2329
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,400
hard work

2330
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:07,079
yeah I think this is where it comes to

2331
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:10,259
like your breeding philosophy your

2332
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:12,899
ethics your professionalism

2333
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:15,179
um all those things yeah

2334
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:16,500
um absolutely

2335
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:19,500
so

2336
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:21,420
for me we're coming to like an end of

2337
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,460
sorts like I was just this section was

2338
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:26,520
kind of just like us zooming out and

2339
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:28,980
looking back and and trying to summarize

2340
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,239
some of the difficulties in breeding and

2341
01:30:28,979 --> 01:30:32,238
I guess I want to say here

2342
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,659
um

2343
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:38,639
this isn't meant to discourage or

2344
01:30:36,658 --> 01:30:41,279
um demotivate people

2345
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:44,279
um or dishearten people about breeding

2346
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,960
no I think really with what for me

2347
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:48,359
anyway and and kind of like sort of

2348
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:51,359
producing this episode I think

2349
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:53,339
I just saw that there was a big gap in

2350
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:56,460
in the discourse around breeding where

2351
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:58,619
people don't really talk about these

2352
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,840
gaps and and complexities and nuances

2353
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:02,579
that often like if you if you're a late

2354
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,279
if you're an amateur like Enthusiast

2355
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:08,460
like me and you Google cannabis breeding

2356
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:10,559
all the stuff that you see that comes up

2357
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,779
in your top results are gonna be like

2358
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,340
[ __ ]

2359
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:16,380
a lot of the time you're going to get

2360
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,260
like European Sea Banks with their like

2361
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:21,840
there's the same blog post being copied

2362
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:23,460
like over and over again yeah and it's

2363
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,020
going to address just the most basic

2364
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:27,539
mendelian stuff that we went over

2365
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:30,780
earlier for example

2366
01:31:27,539 --> 01:31:34,560
so was there anything else in terms of

2367
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:38,279
like practical difficulties that you two

2368
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:41,960
want to add to this mix of like

2369
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:41,960
you know what makes this [ __ ] hard

2370
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:46,619
what makes it hard

2371
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,359
and in like

2372
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:49,679
this is a lot of the reason I kind of

2373
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:51,479
keep going back to the blue bonnet but

2374
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:53,460
it's it's one of those really really

2375
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:55,319
rare lines

2376
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:56,939
um and I and it's been hard to explain

2377
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:58,259
this to people

2378
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:00,599
um and I hope this episode helps

2379
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:03,539
illustrate it when you have a male that

2380
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:06,120
is true reading for a trait that is a

2381
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:07,439
very desirable trait but also most

2382
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:10,679
representations of that line

2383
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:12,359
specifically are low potency low resin

2384
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:13,739
production or not super high resin

2385
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:15,960
production filled with oils and stuff

2386
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:17,819
and it came with so many other good

2387
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,899
traits that it also reached true for so

2388
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:20,460
not only does it breed true for

2389
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:23,279
blueberry it breeds true for a few other

2390
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:26,460
traits and that was the key to me first

2391
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:28,439
that I realized that it probably wasn't

2392
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:30,359
a pure blueberry line because it was

2393
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:33,238
vigorous it had a lot of traits that

2394
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:34,799
aren't even existing in blueberry and

2395
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:36,539
um yeah and it breached true for those

2396
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,219
traits so it was heavily worked but it

2397
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:39,779
wasn't heavily worked in a direction

2398
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,579
that was so inbred that I'm seeing

2399
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:43,439
mutations everywhere in fact it was

2400
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:46,019
missing a lot of the uh the mutations

2401
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:48,299
that commonly pop up in blueberry but it

2402
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:50,040
still had extreme blueberry terms

2403
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:52,079
um it's also why I have a hard time

2404
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:53,460
moving on from Blue bonus stuff because

2405
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:55,439
when you find something that true

2406
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:58,139
breeding I I just don't know of any

2407
01:32:55,439 --> 01:33:00,719
other tool in cannabis quite like it and

2408
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:03,900
I haven't run into it as far as males go

2409
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:06,359
as far as for regular breeding goes and

2410
01:33:03,899 --> 01:33:08,279
is trying to explain to people what is

2411
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:10,439
so special about the work that Lone Star

2412
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:12,059
did is very hard because people just say

2413
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:14,339
it's just someone took blueberry and

2414
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:17,159
it's that you know anybody could do that

2415
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:19,500
I wasn't able to do it he did in many

2416
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:21,658
years of trying uh running a lot of the

2417
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:24,238
progeny making the crosses I could never

2418
01:33:21,658 --> 01:33:26,039
get it past just blueberry Terps without

2419
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,599
and I couldn't bring the potency and I

2420
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:30,960
couldn't bring any resin production with

2421
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:33,000
even in outcrosses so

2422
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:35,399
there's a lot of special stuff that can

2423
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,260
be done in cannabis there is a way to

2424
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:39,960
make true breeding strains it can be

2425
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:41,579
done but it takes a ton of work and

2426
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,800
that's not again not to discourage

2427
01:33:41,579 --> 01:33:45,539
anyone it's to encourage you to do more

2428
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,520
work it's it's to encourage you and say

2429
01:33:45,539 --> 01:33:49,260
that this can be done and there is

2430
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,179
special stuff like that out there and I

2431
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:53,039
did try to make that tool available for

2432
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:55,260
everyone and left it at a nursery for

2433
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:56,819
anybody to use that mail because I felt

2434
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:58,440
like when you find something that's

2435
01:33:56,819 --> 01:34:01,198
special in cannabis if you sit on it

2436
01:33:58,439 --> 01:34:02,519
you're kind of a prick

2437
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:03,960
um it's a very special tool that

2438
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:06,960
everybody should be able to use and

2439
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:08,520
blueberry has very that that scent for

2440
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,279
whatever reason has very medical

2441
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:12,719
applications that come along with it in

2442
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:14,759
my opinion and and for a lot of people

2443
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:17,760
who smoke it whether it's anti-anxiety

2444
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,500
nerve pain relief pain relief period And

2445
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,020
so with those medical applications to

2446
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,600
sit on that would be super selfish so I

2447
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:27,659
tried but the nursery ended up giving

2448
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,340
hbov so it no longer exists but I do

2449
01:34:27,658 --> 01:34:31,679
believe that people find stuff like that

2450
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,119
share it share it give it to the

2451
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:36,119
community it's that important breeding

2452
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:37,679
tools like that can open shift people's

2453
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:39,000
paradigms on what can be achieved and

2454
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:41,219
accomplished and I'm not even the best

2455
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,539
at what I do so I can imagine what

2456
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:44,880
something like that would do and

2457
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:47,100
something in someone super competent or

2458
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,880
someone's super creative's hands you

2459
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,039
know someone that thinks much

2460
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,500
differently than me

2461
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:54,119
yeah and I you know I I think it's good

2462
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,979
that you keep uh drawing our attention

2463
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:58,198
to the Bluebonnet because

2464
01:34:55,979 --> 01:35:00,299
it is exceptional and like we what like

2465
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:03,178
we what we mentioned like it is rare to

2466
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:05,159
find something that has

2467
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:09,000
you know relatively fixed traits that do

2468
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:10,859
pass and yeah that is yeah yeah and and

2469
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,859
I want to re I want to restate again

2470
01:35:10,859 --> 01:35:15,599
it's not flashing my buttons and like

2471
01:35:13,859 --> 01:35:17,460
bragging about blue bonnet because it's

2472
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,739
not my work and I mean I've done work

2473
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,239
with it that line is not my work it was

2474
01:35:19,738 --> 01:35:22,979
done by someone else named Lone Star

2475
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:24,959
from Texas resin company he's no longer

2476
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:27,000
with us and

2477
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,739
it's more to shine a spotlight on him

2478
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,119
and his work and his contributions in

2479
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:33,119
cannabis

2480
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:34,260
yep yep yep

2481
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:35,939
um local was there anything else you

2482
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,800
wanted to add on this kind of like

2483
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:39,779
summary of

2484
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,219
all the complexities of breeding and

2485
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:43,319
what makes it difficult at least from

2486
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:46,500
this General level yeah

2487
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:48,658
um I guess I'll just say make sure that

2488
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:50,460
what you're hunting and wanting to breed

2489
01:35:48,658 --> 01:35:54,479
with is something that you're genuinely

2490
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:56,698
excited about because you know as soon

2491
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:59,879
as you lose interest and something you

2492
01:35:56,698 --> 01:36:01,619
kind of lose motivation and where to

2493
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,960
take it

2494
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:06,719
um

2495
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:09,060
and to also understand that each plant

2496
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:12,239
is a tool like Matt was saying it's like

2497
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:15,120
you know me for example when I was doing

2498
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:17,519
seed pops it's like I was trying to find

2499
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:20,399
the thing that was most comparable to

2500
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:23,100
Sweet Pea but then you realize this

2501
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:25,679
isn't the way to hunt because like you

2502
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:27,000
know sweet pea is its own thing these

2503
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,560
other plants

2504
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,079
they're not related there's something

2505
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:34,139
different you know why am I looking for

2506
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:38,639
this and this when that's like you know

2507
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:41,219
not what it is yeah

2508
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,380
yeah really really good point I think

2509
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:44,819
there are like quite a few different we

2510
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,560
haven't really dived into this too much

2511
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:49,319
we've implied a lot of it there are a

2512
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:51,000
lot of interesting psychological

2513
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:53,039
um

2514
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,479
uh phenomena when it comes to breeding

2515
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:56,639
and things you have to overcome whether

2516
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,500
it's like the stress of knowing that

2517
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:02,219
you're you're you're doing these like

2518
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:04,139
big gambles whether it's about tension

2519
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:07,020
within yourself about what your goals

2520
01:37:04,139 --> 01:37:09,000
are or what material you should be using

2521
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:10,860
I think there's so many interesting like

2522
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,639
yeah

2523
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:16,619
um side effects

2524
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:18,359
failure and and the ability like the one

2525
01:37:16,619 --> 01:37:20,219
thing I see the most that people have

2526
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:22,259
the most trouble with and it was what we

2527
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:25,500
start talked about at the beginning was

2528
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:26,460
being really really honest with oneself

2529
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:29,238
about

2530
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:31,560
how you spent your money on your seeds

2531
01:37:29,238 --> 01:37:33,899
what you have

2532
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:36,420
who who made it

2533
01:37:33,899 --> 01:37:39,238
and just because you've invested money

2534
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:41,779
into it does it mean it's what you want

2535
01:37:39,238 --> 01:37:41,779
it to be

2536
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:48,500
confirmation bias is a huge cost fallacy

2537
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:48,500
yeah

2538
01:37:48,539 --> 01:37:51,060
yeah

2539
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:53,340
totally

2540
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:55,739
okay

2541
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:57,480
um if there's nothing else that you two

2542
01:37:55,738 --> 01:37:59,819
want to add I did have a couple of

2543
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:02,698
community questions just to type it off

2544
01:37:59,819 --> 01:38:05,698
let's do it um

2545
01:38:02,698 --> 01:38:07,678
so uh someone who was an overnight

2546
01:38:05,698 --> 01:38:09,000
sensation in the Discord is no longer in

2547
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:12,480
the Discord and we don't know whether

2548
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,399
they're like real or not um asked what

2549
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:17,519
fundamental breeding skills deserve more

2550
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:20,119
attention than most people appreciate

2551
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,120
research

2552
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:24,840
research number one number one most

2553
01:38:23,698 --> 01:38:25,919
people think that they are well

2554
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,719
researched because they have a High

2555
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,219
Times magazine or because they back

2556
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:31,920
write a forum

2557
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:34,079
that you know is one of the few out of

2558
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,399
the many that were existing that they

2559
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:36,899
think might have the best data because

2560
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:38,399
it's old and that's not necessarily the

2561
01:38:36,899 --> 01:38:39,899
case it might just have the most

2562
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:41,658
successful seed bank attached to it and

2563
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:43,859
that's why it's still around you know

2564
01:38:41,658 --> 01:38:45,839
might be the most successful marketing

2565
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:48,119
SEO that's why it's still around and

2566
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,739
survived the much better forums so

2567
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:52,380
research

2568
01:38:49,738 --> 01:38:53,459
is just if you don't do it you never

2569
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,560
know where you're going to start and

2570
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,480
you're just so hard to say this but

2571
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,679
you're really in many senses when it

2572
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:01,919
comes to breeding you're just playing

2573
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:03,960
and giving yourself bad data points or

2574
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,179
not bad data points because every data

2575
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:07,859
point is a data point but maybe no more

2576
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:10,619
null data points because you're going to

2577
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:12,299
have to toss them out at some point

2578
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:13,920
yeah

2579
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:15,539
yeah

2580
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:20,100
how about you local

2581
01:39:15,539 --> 01:39:22,439
I mean one uh research is obviously you

2582
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:25,139
know really important because

2583
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:27,479
you know not knowing what your baselines

2584
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:29,520
are kind of just you know voids

2585
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:33,119
everything out because you can't compare

2586
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:35,820
something like you can't trace ancestry

2587
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:38,519
you know and no matter what Philo says

2588
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:40,139
exactly and that's another thing real

2589
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:42,000
quick I want to interject

2590
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:43,920
going to philos looking at their data is

2591
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,380
not research like this has been proven

2592
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,060
to talk about it but right and you know

2593
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,760
that has to do with the whole provenance

2594
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:53,580
thing but you know one thing that kind

2595
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:55,980
of like resonated with me between this

2596
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:59,698
community and like the science Community

2597
01:39:55,979 --> 01:40:01,619
is in quantitative genetics you know we

2598
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:04,319
kind of have a similar goal of like

2599
01:40:01,619 --> 01:40:07,139
being able to tell what something is

2600
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:09,238
based off of growing Generations not

2601
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:14,219
just like one plant but multiple

2602
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:16,500
Generations parental you know uh F1 F2

2603
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:17,520
you know in crosses all that because

2604
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:20,760
like

2605
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:23,340
the more information you have you know

2606
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:25,020
with these populations the more it tells

2607
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:27,719
you about what your starting material

2608
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:29,699
was but not only that it tells you

2609
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:32,279
what's behind your starting material

2610
01:40:29,698 --> 01:40:35,158
because Beyond a certain point like the

2611
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:38,359
story just says yes and we don't know

2612
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:41,099
what happens before that sadly

2613
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:43,979
yeah yeah

2614
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:46,739
so I guess ultimately you just want as

2615
01:40:43,979 --> 01:40:48,479
much information as you can get however

2616
01:40:46,738 --> 01:40:50,638
you can get it whether it's by a

2617
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:51,839
provenance whether it's via progeny

2618
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,420
testing

2619
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,639
yeah you want you want to maximize your

2620
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:58,500
information space before you begin

2621
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,420
good information because there's just so

2622
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:02,100
much bad information and Matt in

2623
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:04,619
cannabis maximizing your information

2624
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:06,719
space isn't necessarily better it's

2625
01:41:04,619 --> 01:41:08,939
maximizing your

2626
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:11,219
yeah reliable information space which is

2627
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:14,039
the hardest part hardest part to get to

2628
01:41:11,219 --> 01:41:17,460
and that goes back to the research

2629
01:41:14,039 --> 01:41:19,679
yeah very good distinction

2630
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:22,260
um okay well we're kind of coming to the

2631
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:25,260
end of this episode and just to remind

2632
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:28,260
people what the intention was here

2633
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:29,460
the intention was really to set the

2634
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:33,840
scene

2635
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:36,539
to set the tone of like where does the

2636
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,579
theory get us where does it not get us

2637
01:41:36,539 --> 01:41:41,340
what are some of the Practical

2638
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:43,079
complexities of breeding what uh the

2639
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:44,940
trade-offs of some of the individual

2640
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:47,158
techniques

2641
01:41:44,939 --> 01:41:50,099
um what we have not addressed obviously

2642
01:41:47,158 --> 01:41:51,618
is any specific

2643
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:53,880
scenarios

2644
01:41:51,618 --> 01:41:55,618
for example they are going to be

2645
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:56,819
breeding scenarios where obviously

2646
01:41:55,618 --> 01:41:59,339
you're going to need a combination of

2647
01:41:56,819 --> 01:42:01,500
these techniques yes which is going to

2648
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:03,539
increase the complexity yet again and we

2649
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:05,340
haven't approached those things yet but

2650
01:42:03,539 --> 01:42:07,198
I think our goal for the next few

2651
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:10,260
episodes I don't know how many there

2652
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:12,118
will be is to and I haven't decided on

2653
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:15,300
this but I'm assuming it's either to

2654
01:42:12,118 --> 01:42:17,279
cover historical projects where there's

2655
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:20,340
a lot to learn from them

2656
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:23,219
or to cover hypothetical breeding

2657
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:25,139
projects where we can continue to tease

2658
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:27,960
out some of the nuances some of the

2659
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:30,060
possible approaches because I think as

2660
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:31,980
y'all are gathering like there's so many

2661
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,420
possible permutations of techniques that

2662
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:35,579
you could use as well you don't just

2663
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:37,260
have to use one technique for your

2664
01:42:35,579 --> 01:42:38,399
project at different points of your

2665
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:41,520
project you might need to use different

2666
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:45,960
tools right so I hope that we can get

2667
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:48,060
into the particularities and nuances in

2668
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:51,359
the subsequent episodes

2669
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:52,980
yeah I think I think I think we will one

2670
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:54,599
of the number one questions I'm asked is

2671
01:42:52,979 --> 01:42:57,599
can you cross a regular mail to a

2672
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,800
feminist see yeah got plenty of room to

2673
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,480
cover those

2674
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,739
yeah we've got lots of cool questions

2675
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:02,519
like that

2676
01:43:01,738 --> 01:43:05,459
um

2677
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:07,679
and I think again when it comes to

2678
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:10,439
setting the tone and we already I don't

2679
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:12,600
apologize for this too much right but

2680
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:14,279
um we took this kind of really honest

2681
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,020
candid approach

2682
01:43:14,279 --> 01:43:16,979
um almost kind of like pessimistic

2683
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,960
approach

2684
01:43:16,979 --> 01:43:20,638
just basically just trying to be real

2685
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:23,520
with people

2686
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:26,100
and trying to be as clear as we can be

2687
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:28,320
to the best of our knowledge on what you

2688
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:30,860
actually are going to face

2689
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:34,439
and I don't think there's any reason to

2690
01:43:30,859 --> 01:43:36,118
like be optimistic and skate over what

2691
01:43:34,439 --> 01:43:38,219
are clearly going to be obstacles for

2692
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:40,259
people so I think that was the major

2693
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:42,060
intent of this episode and sending the

2694
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:43,800
foundation for future conversations

2695
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:45,719
about breeding

2696
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,460
is there anything else that

2697
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:50,219
like the two of you

2698
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:52,739
um would like to add at this point

2699
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:56,279
go ahead local anything

2700
01:43:52,738 --> 01:43:57,599
I mean just do what's fun for you you

2701
01:43:56,279 --> 01:44:00,118
know like

2702
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:02,159
you're the person making this election

2703
01:44:00,118 --> 01:44:04,559
what are you excited about in selections

2704
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:06,738
you're seeing right now

2705
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,739
um

2706
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:12,420
I mean

2707
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:14,399
I've been really pumped about some of

2708
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:15,239
the Appalachia stuff

2709
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:18,420
um

2710
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:19,019
and it's really kind of interesting

2711
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:21,420
um

2712
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:23,760
you know

2713
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:26,520
having seen some of these stuff with the

2714
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,780
Appalachia you know and now that I'm

2715
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,219
kind of flowering out the good old

2716
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:32,399
Mountain Dew I think it's going to be

2717
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:34,920
really cool to kind of see you know what

2718
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:37,079
the difference in selection did

2719
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:40,020
you know are there going to be similar

2720
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:42,658
smell profiles you know because to me

2721
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:44,639
right now like what I'm smelling in this

2722
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:47,579
you know in the good old Mountain Dew is

2723
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:50,100
not what I've smelled like in the Silver

2724
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:52,559
Mountain Haze or the yo mama or any of

2725
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:55,920
that yeah it's a really different range

2726
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,900
of smell really so you know it's kind of

2727
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:00,920
cool to like slowly like

2728
01:44:57,899 --> 01:45:04,738
kind of pick away at these like you know

2729
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:07,139
comparisons that you know are

2730
01:45:04,738 --> 01:45:08,099
they're not like apple to Apple but it's

2731
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:10,819
not like

2732
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:13,320
Apple to Orange you know sure

2733
01:45:10,819 --> 01:45:17,579
you're seeing different parallels that

2734
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:20,158
that's a better way to put it you know

2735
01:45:17,579 --> 01:45:22,920
um so I think that's really cool

2736
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:25,738
um having seen you know um some of pax

2737
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:27,600
uh train wreck stuff in person like I

2738
01:45:25,738 --> 01:45:30,238
thought that was really [ __ ] dope

2739
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:33,060
because like homie literally brought the

2740
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:36,118
entire lineup I mean he did not really

2741
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:38,039
but you know most of what we had and it

2742
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:39,599
was really cool to kind of see how train

2743
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:42,960
wreck blended with some of these things

2744
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:45,600
and kind of also be able to see like

2745
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,800
that hey you know this

2746
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,020
thing

2747
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:53,279
um so-called dominance is a real thing

2748
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:55,380
because I I saw it you know yeah I can

2749
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:57,300
for sure be dominant over a lot of

2750
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:58,440
things but also it could blend

2751
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:00,119
beautifully

2752
01:45:58,439 --> 01:46:02,158
there are a few things that Blended

2753
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:05,099
amazing With You know despite its

2754
01:46:02,158 --> 01:46:07,519
dominance and so I think that's really

2755
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:11,699
one of the like

2756
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:13,560
you know takeaways really is you're

2757
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:15,599
never really gonna know until you see it

2758
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:19,739
and or until you make the combination

2759
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:22,619
either like and you know yeah dominance

2760
01:46:19,738 --> 01:46:24,599
we know it in theory like we know it's a

2761
01:46:22,618 --> 01:46:27,839
thing but to be able to see it you know

2762
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:30,000
it's totally different

2763
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:33,239
yeah and I'm glad you mentioned some of

2764
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,920
the homies projects because yeah again I

2765
01:46:33,238 --> 01:46:37,979
think in the subsequent episodes it's a

2766
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,600
perfect time to dip in like dig deeper

2767
01:46:37,979 --> 01:46:42,779
into some of those stories because I

2768
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:45,000
think they're so rich every project is

2769
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:46,859
so rich like with learning um that we

2770
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,679
could share with other people

2771
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:52,139
so yeah

2772
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:54,179
I guess that's uh it I don't really have

2773
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:55,380
anything else to add other than you know

2774
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:57,600
like uh

2775
01:46:55,380 --> 01:47:00,060
check out our Discord patreon if you

2776
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,920
want to do research with us

2777
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:04,920
um we're all there interacting a lot

2778
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:08,219
like even in the audio chat and um

2779
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:11,340
this is what we live eat sleep breathe

2780
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:12,420
drink this is a true passion for most of

2781
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:13,020
us

2782
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:14,819
um

2783
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:17,400
like we talk about it here a lot like

2784
01:47:14,819 --> 01:47:20,939
nerd out but like this is all some of us

2785
01:47:17,399 --> 01:47:23,219
do like yeah I want to add I want to add

2786
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:26,039
here too that like at the moment these

2787
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:28,319
episodes are kind of being co co-written

2788
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:32,340
in a way by our community members

2789
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:34,738
absolutely so we're actually like

2790
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:37,380
building this alongside what everyone

2791
01:47:34,738 --> 01:47:40,198
else is talking about their input's so

2792
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:41,760
important so important I mean as I've

2793
01:47:40,198 --> 01:47:45,719
been doing this a long time like trying

2794
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:47,039
to educate with what little I know but a

2795
01:47:45,719 --> 01:47:50,520
lot with what other people have taught

2796
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:52,800
me you know and um this has helped a ton

2797
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:54,119
and and I've learned a lot from them and

2798
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,159
they're helping

2799
01:47:54,118 --> 01:47:57,960
they're helping me figure out what I

2800
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:59,279
haven't covered in the past and maybe

2801
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:01,260
things that like I wouldn't have even

2802
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:03,658
taken into account because I'm so busy

2803
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:05,400
like with my head in a specific part of

2804
01:48:03,658 --> 01:48:07,559
breeding that I haven't even touched on

2805
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:09,238
a lot of the the stuff that I should

2806
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,739
have touched on earlier like bringing it

2807
01:48:09,238 --> 01:48:11,939
back so this has been amazing it's been

2808
01:48:10,738 --> 01:48:13,618
a great experience

2809
01:48:11,939 --> 01:48:16,198
and we will get we'll definitely get a

2810
01:48:13,618 --> 01:48:18,179
chance to to get to those points Matt in

2811
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:20,339
the future as well and so yeah again

2812
01:48:18,179 --> 01:48:23,880

2818
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:33,359
now where I can't promise that I've

2819
01:48:31,859 --> 01:48:36,179
actually seen every single question

2820
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:37,618
because that's that's how much volume

2821

we're getting now which is really really
