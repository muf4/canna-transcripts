you live

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,318
it's bad

47
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,039
it's super bad yeah because you live in

48
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,518
like literal purgatory yeah

49
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,840
mine is just partial purgatory

50
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
uh

51
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
but yeah i went uh yeah i went and saw

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
an old buddy of mine we hung out and

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,200
chatted for hours about various things

54
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,439
and uh

55
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,518

weeks so thank you all for thanks matt

57
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
for holding down the fort while

58
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,518
i went on a mission

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
uh which we'll uh

60
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,319
hear a little bit more about some point

61
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,079
in the future

62
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,759
yeah you know yeah hopefully hopefully

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
you'll be able to talk about it soon

64
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,000
yeah i mean i can say in a general sense

65
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
i just went on a

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
a mission looking for pockets of old

67
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,359
things

68
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,560
yeah and you found some pockets of old

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,840
things i did yeah i did yeah so people

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
are going to be you know and that's it's

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,759
kind of interesting too because it's

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
like one of the one of the things about

73
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,959
about weed that i find really

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
interesting and we'll talk about this as

75
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,959
part of like the clone thing tonight

76
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,079
is that how

77
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,560
like brokers and the demand from the

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
public dramatically changes what people

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
grow

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,519
yeah right so

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
in california or oregon or washington or

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,439
these places that are like really sort

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,840
of like in tune or can't sort of came

84
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,959
about with medical or legal earlier

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,120
there was a lot more rapid change in um

86
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
and what people grew because of what

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
people demanded

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,840
yeah and so in some cases now

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
um you know you have to go and look for

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,039
some of these i don't want to call them

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,360
backward states because that's rude but

92
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,878
like yeah states that were slower to

93
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
adopt

94
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,199
uh you know some of this stuff which

95
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,759
meant that people could grow things that

96
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,759
were a lot older and they still worked

97
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,959
really well for the crew that they were

98
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,399
giving them to

99
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
yeah because there was a lot of

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,399
competition with the new new as it were

101
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,199
there wasn't there wasn't pressure to

102
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,719
change yeah um and really you know that

103
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
it kind of ties into what we're talking

104
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,199
about tonight because pressure to change

105
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,758
and a desire to make your life easy and

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,280
give the broker what they want um is

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,080
what kind of makes uh old cuts disappear

108
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,679
yeah

109
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,120
you know that is it and that's what

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
we're seeing today and we've talked

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,040
about the last few episodes i mean if

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,439
you would have told me 10 years ago

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,720
that uh sour real sour diesel could be

114
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,800
kind of hard to acquire depending yeah

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,680
no one would believe it yeah i'm

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,000
actually shocked that lately today

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,720
people keep telling me that the forum

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,199
cut of cookies is becoming hard to

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,039
source which blows my mind yeah i mean

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,520
it's one of those things where you know

121
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,639
i've mentioned this before but um every

122
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,038
five or ten years weed reinvents itself

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,439
yeah i mean matt and i matt and i looked

124
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,279
at it i have a friend up here who got a

125
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,038
freezer of somebody who i know everyone

126
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,399
talks about freezer beans or whatever

127
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,159
yeah but uh my friend got a freezer of

128
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,679
old beans from people that was someone

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
that was retiring and kind of getting

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,639
out of the game right and instead of

131
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,879
being like from the ancient 80s or sssc

132
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,478
or [ __ ] that people claim it was almost

133
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,800
all from 2008 to 2012. yeah it was weird

134
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,478
era i reached in i reached out to matt

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
because i was busy having kids and doing

136
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,519
a bunch of sit down and that was sort of

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,600
like really your prime time yeah

138
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,079
right when you were like really really

139
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,479
in tune with what was going on yeah and

140
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,918
it was it was surprising to matt and i

141
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,079
looking over it

142
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,279
just how ancient a lot of those things

143
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,519
were and how 99 of it was unavailable

144
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,000
yeah even especially the rascal stuff

145
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,680
like at the time was really hot selling

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,160
really well a lot of the femme stuff he

147
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,560
was uh our main competition at the time

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,160
as it were for femme stuff and looking

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
at it i'm not i a lot of that stuff's

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,479
hard to grab now and it's great stuff

151
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,000
yeah a lot of it and that's only from

152
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,318
you know 14 12 14 years ago yeah which

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,199
doesn't seem that long to me it's not

154
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,199
actually because you know

155
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,520
traumas are very current

156
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,199
you know it always feels current yeah so

157
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,000
that's what that's what's interesting is

158
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,560
like you get back to 10 12 years ago and

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
and it's almost impossible to find

160
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
um a lot of seed stock from then and

161
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,839
then you go back 10 more years and it's

162
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,160
harder and you go back to the 90s and oh

163
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,839
my god and you go back to the 80s and

164
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,960
it's almost legends

165
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,799
yeah

166
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,638
you know which isn't really all that

167
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
long but the way prohibition works and

168
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
the way the market works so

169
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,239
you know there's people there might be

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
people in various states that are slow

171
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,439
to adapt

172
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,639
um that have been rocking the same thing

173
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,918
for 20 25 years yeah because it's worked

174
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,598
for them

175
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,198
right and the little customer base that

176
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,439
they have that they you know that they

177
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,000
give their access to is super stoked on

178
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,160
it yeah um and you so you almost need

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
those pockets

180
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
um you know because like you know when

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,360
we talked about the purple episode every

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,199
big grower i knew ran some kind of gdp

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
urkel mendo p

184
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
um you know great yeah something hybrid

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,120
yeah

186
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,120
and then fast forward ten years and like

187
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,759
six people held on to it

188
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
yep how it goes out of hundreds just in

189
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
my little area

190
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,959
yeah

191
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,399
you know

192
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,839
and yeah there's someone that's talking

193
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,799
right now about oh i'm sick it has to be

194
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,198
purple

195
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,598
you know the purple craze was like i

196
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,319
would say it was like 030405

197
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:47,199
maybe a little bit of o6 and then it

198
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,160
went away for 15 years yeah it went away

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
for for quite a while 15 18 years or

200
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,720
something like that and then now all of

201
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,960
a sudden it's back

202
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,479
and people are just as annoyed now as

203
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,758
they were back then

204
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,878
yeah

205
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,439
you know

206
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
um although back then i would say

207
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,199
one of the biggest things about the

208
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,360
purple craze that i don't like

209
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,240
was it was really the first time

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,639
where

211
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,038
a lot of diversity got lost

212
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
because people just wanted what the

213
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,598
brokers wanted to buy

214
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
yeah

215
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,038
and so they were growing all these

216
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,878
different things and you know

217
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,839
um and then all of a sudden people are

218
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,400
like well i want purple

219
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,119
yeah

220
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,679
yeah a lot of beautiful beautiful green

221
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,759
lovely strains went by the wayside for

222
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,759
the the oracle days yeah and we're gonna

223
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,918
we're gonna talk about like old clones a

224
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,240
lot today and that was really one of the

225
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,439
eras that be that kind of ushered in

226
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
like the

227
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,320
everybody wants to grow the most popular

228
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,800
thing at the time yeah because pre

229
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,360
purple craze of like you know early

230
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,199
2000s the amount of diversity that

231
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,919
worked for the small and the medium

232
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,440
market was pretty incredible yeah if it

233
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,838
was good weed it probably sold

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
unlike today unlike today where you do

235
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,800
see a lot of really good weed go by the

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,880
wayside for

237
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,120
stuff that maybe we would all agree

238
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,519
isn't as uh

239
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
what we would consider kind as some of

240
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,320
the others

241
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
oh somebody just said oh six is when i

242
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,800
first went to reggae on the river and

243
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,959
the custy kids had got purple

244
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,559
got purple shirts on i went to i went to

245
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,599
reggae on the river from i don't know

246
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,879
probably like 95 to 03 or 004 i think 03

247
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
was like their

248
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,399
their 20-year anniversary maybe or

249
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,518
something like that

250
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,120
and uh after going for 10 years i'd seen

251
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,560
most of the acts i wanted to see and it

252
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
had gotten kind of

253
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,679
a little hectic

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
uh yeah i kind of felt like it was more

255
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,159
like have a bunch of city kids show up

256
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
on the river and hope nobody dies

257
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,000
kind of

258
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,839
can you imagine reggae on the river in

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,440
bakersfield how that would go with that

260
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,279
well there's no river

261
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,760
there's a river here but we didn't have

262
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,039
we had the kern river here which is big

263
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,120
but we didn't have that we what we had

264
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,199
was called reggae fest

265
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,799
and it was just i started playing those

266
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
shows in about 06 because we had the

267
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,919
reggae band going on at the time but it

268
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,560
was very different than like the steel

269
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,799
drum type reggae that a lot of people

270
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,039
had it was just phenomenal to see what

271
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,199
bakersfield offers in terms of reggae

272
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,958
fans it was it's pretty cool i mean i i

273
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,278
never got to go to reggae on the river

274
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,958
myself that's a that's a tangent but i

275
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,200
will talk about it just a couple of

276
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:26,159
times because when i was coming out here

277
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,399
in the mid 90s as a midwestern kid

278
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,480
um reggae on the river has like two

279
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,320
extremely clear memories where i really

280
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
realized that like the emerald triangle

281
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,040
in california was a different place than

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,600
where i was from yeah um there was there

283
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,719
was dready kids walking around reggae in

284
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,120
95 96 back then it was still a two-day

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,879
it was still a two-day weekend festival

286
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,639
and it was a lot more locals that hadn't

287
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,639
had like as many like city kids and

288
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,278
stuff coming up from the bay yet yeah

289
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,319
but people were walking around with with

290
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,078
five gallon buckets with spears in them

291
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
and you could buy a spear

292
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,078
like a a spear of wheat a top oh oh i

293
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,519
thought you meant spirits to threat i'm

294
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,278
like wow like it's not like that kind of

295
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,480
spear but i mean like for me as like

296
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,159
someone who comes from like a world

297
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,639
where it all had to be hidden

298
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,719
oh yeah walking up and down the lot

299
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,039
with a bunch of stems sticking out of a

300
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,440
top and pulling out an 18-inch top to

301
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,278
sell that's [ __ ] awesome that was

302
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,000
pretty incredible and like where where

303
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,399
reggae used to be it's like um where the

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,120
river is you can like look up and like

305
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,120
the 101 the highway 101 is way up there

306
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,240
right yeah and i remember i was like

307
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,759
sitting in a seat on the riverbed and i

308
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,560
was pulling bongs

309
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,360
and i looked up and there was a highway

310
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,838
patrol looking right at me

311
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,600
and so coming from the midwest like if

312
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
you make eye contact with a cop and

313
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
you're doing drugs like you're it's not

314
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,000
a good scene

315
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,479
yeah no and he waved to me and then just

316
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,919
went back to what he was doing

317
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
and i was like literally ready to like

318
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,639
throw the bomb in the river and run into

319
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
the crowd

320
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
yeah because that was like my training

321
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,319
like what i you know like you it was

322
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,159
time to run yeah

323
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,839
and he was just he just gave me a wave

324
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:10,319
and and went back to what he was doing

325
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,920
and i was like oh my god you know

326
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
there you are you're back

327
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,719
yeah oh my god so

328
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
yeah i mean those are but those were

329
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,399
like two seminal moments at reggae on

330
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,159
the river that for most people might not

331
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,639
be that big of a deal

332
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,559
but it just showed like what yeah like

333
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,039
how different how like there was a

334
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,518
bubble that we lived in

335
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,599
you know yeah it was a bumper

336
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,240
that was a bubble so

337
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,000
i i went through and and tonight we're

338
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,159
gonna be might be joined by someone i'm

339
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,600
not sure we talked about it but as

340
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,439
stoners will do we just decided that uh

341
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
uh we'll see if he shows up you know

342
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,560
because you know

343
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,799
plans or plans and that's that's rough

344
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,399
even for me so we'll see if this person

345
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,000
shows up but um

346
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
i went through the can of bible three

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
because i remember that there was a

348
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,600
great list in here of the the late 90s

349
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,720
early 2000s clones

350
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
and i thought it would be fun to go

351
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,240
through this list together

352
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,519
and and there's some that i added in

353
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,959
there's some that i took out of their

354
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,799
list because they really weren't that

355
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,638
relevant in terms of anything they just

356
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,319
happened to be things that he was aware

357
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,079
of that he threw in the middle but um

358
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,120
we got it all together brynn even made

359
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,958
it pretty with a a fish and

360
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,919
uh yeah whenever you want to start going

361
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,199
through it we can start going through it

362
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,439
uh

363
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
jason someone just asked jason is not

364
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,160
the guest no

365
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,839
no one's talked to him but um you know

366
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,679
who knows you know i used to be pretty

367
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,279
good friends with him a long time ago he

368
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,638
would definitely be a character to have

369
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,759
on one day

370
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,480
um yeah for sure in that regard you know

371
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,159
yeah it would be very interesting

372
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
super opinionated i don't know maybe

373
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,159
he's mellowed in the last bit but uh you

374
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
know

375
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,719
highly opinionated he definitely oh and

376
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,198
that's mellow uh yeah he was super

377
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,199
opinionated in person uh some people it

378
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,479
drove him absolutely nuts

379
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,719
i can relate

380
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,278
that i really liked him and i liked like

381
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,120
his vibe and what he was trying to do

382
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,958
yeah yeah sure but it's hard because

383
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
like when you're when you're so certain

384
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,638
about something and you don't leave room

385
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,639
for other people's opinions

386
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,560
yeah you can secretly offend a lot of

387
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,440
people sure which matt knows nothing

388
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,119
about

389
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,279
i wouldn't i wouldn't i'm very open

390
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
people he's not he's not he's not into

391
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,879
that um

392
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,399
but uh

393
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,198
but yeah you know they

394
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,278
so just as a general sense um before we

395
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,479
before we you know dive into the list a

396
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,958
little bit um i will say that you know

397
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
like i was mentioning earlier

398
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,198
um

399
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,039
when there wasn't much weed uh most

400
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,198
weeds sold

401
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,879
yeah because it was better than mexican

402
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,519
that was sort of like the standard like

403
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,519
if it was better than green or brown

404
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,799
mexican it's sold

405
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,679
and then as

406
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,479
the thing matured and and like and and

407
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,879
and fads and waves started happening

408
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,519
certain popular cuts started getting you

409
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,439
know more in demand than others yeah but

410
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,959
there was this period i would say from

411
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,240
the mid 90s to the mid 2000s that may

412
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,599
have been

413
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,198
the greatest diversity era we've seen

414
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,560
and that's where most of these cuts that

415
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,759
matt and i are going to talk about come

416
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,759
from because

417
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,559
they came at a time when there was a lot

418
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,319
of seed banks starting to operate uh in

419
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,239
amsterdam and there was a lot of

420
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,519
genetics starting to get traded around

421
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
friends

422
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,600
and

423
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,720
um almost all goodweed had a place

424
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,959
yeah

425
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,959
and it hadn't really it hadn't really

426
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,239
been like oh you you don't have sour i

427
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,758
don't want to buy it you don't have

428
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,000
perkle i don't want to buy it you don't

429
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,759
have gelato i don't want to buy it that

430
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,720
hadn't happened so that meant a lot of

431
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
people

432
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,160
could

433
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,440
grow what they liked pick what they

434
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,319
liked and form a little vibe on it

435
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,560
yeah

436
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
and i would honestly say that's probably

437
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,198
all that stuff that we're about to chat

438
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,919
about is probably the backbone of today

439
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,039
you know i would also uh put this in the

440
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,439
era

441
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,958
before og kush was readily available in

442
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,680
seed for everyone

443
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,638
that's when i noticed the big change in

444
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,439
whole collectives being just og kush we

445
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,639
want og og are [ __ ] nothing you know

446
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,399
um

447
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,759
right before that was readily available

448
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,679
for everyone i i remember i remember uh

449
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,600
walking into a club in in the in uh l.a

450
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,919
yeah seeing literally no exaggeration

451
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,839
like 25 different types of kush

452
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,479
yeah

453
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,800
yeah and they're like reminders based on

454
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,360
it and you're like well like that's all

455
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,559
you're that's that's the whole thing

456
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,039
yeah you know

457
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,119
like there's nothing else

458
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,198
um but you know the reason why there's

459
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,799
financial reasons that happened

460
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,879
uh there's there was you know there's

461
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,159
various economic indicators that push

462
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,159
all those things

463
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,559
yeah you know like when i first started

464
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,958
coming out to uh to mendo

465
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,799
it was very very common to buy mixed

466
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,599
finos pounds

467
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,759
yeah it was all the same strain

468
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,240
right but they were they they would

469
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,798
blend the different plants together

470
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,318
it didn't have to be like i have a 50

471
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,838
pack of just this one cut

472
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,678
that hasn't started yet but then

473
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,958
eventually it became it had to be this

474
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,919
one thing

475
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
yep

476
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,799
and every time that's happened even

477
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,318
though the purples i love the urkel and

478
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,000
the mendo p and stuff like that are

479
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,599
pretty close to my heart and i love sour

480
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,880
diesel um and most of the sour diesels

481
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,480
that people argue about right now

482
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,960
whether they're real or not or most of

483
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
them are good smoke yeah og kush's are

484

good yeah

488
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,200
they just they just came at a cost of

489
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,160
everything else

490
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,440

00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,798
i don't i'm not familiar with it what's

499
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,599
that aoda is aota

500
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,558
and it was all of the above

501
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,719
okay

502
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,798
uh we used to rock the aota in the early

503
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,319
2000s i don't know who mentioned it

504
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,639
um but the iota was really tasty lead

505
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,879
so whoever mentioned that uh super cool

506
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
that you popped that up yeah that's

507
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,600
something i didn't even know about i

508
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,759
don't think i don't think i've seen the

509
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,519
aoda since probably

510
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,079
oh i don't know i don't know when the

511
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,000
last time i saw the oh the the toyota

512
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,759
but we had it in our crew i don't even

513
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,960
remember where it came from

514
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,279
to be honest

515
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,000
um but it was uh it was it was it was

516
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:49,279
good weed it was it was fruity

517
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,200
and uh it was it was really tasty

518
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,720
okay so i keep remembering little ones

519
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,519
to add in as i'm going through this but

520
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,038
i'll start at the top afgui which

521
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,038
predictably was going to be one of them

522
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,798
do you have experience with the afco

523
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,720
uh

524
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,679
you know a lot of people liked the af

525
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,798
gui

526
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,480
i sort of thought it was blandish

527
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,558
you probably smoked that nasty ass

528
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,839
outdoor version i mean i don't know you

529
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,160
can talk about it then because i don't

530
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,558
have the greatest memories of the afgoo

531
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,360
so i it it was spelled so many different

532
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:22,079
ways people would spell like afkahui f

533
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,399
gui some people think that gooey is

534
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,199
appgui which goes from gooey breeder i

535
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,679
don't know i don't have enough

536
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,160
experience with gooey breeders gooey um

537
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,320
the fbi i was familiar with was a more i

538
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,120
wouldn't say short but yes it was it was

539
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,399
more squatter than most uh

540
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,479
plants you people are used to dealing

541
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
with it had this beautiful almost

542
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,558
watermelon blueberry type terp that was

543
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,120
very hard to describe and it was true

544
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,440
breeding for it um almost everything i

545
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,279
crossed it to or that it was crossed in

546
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,038
took on the aft gooey smell and i could

547
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,480
see how people could get very

548
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,038
overwhelmed by it because it's very

549
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,000
distinctive um you could also describe

550
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,679
as like cantaloupe berry it was it was

551
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,839
unique and i i tended to love it it

552
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,000
would pass on beautiful resin traits uh

553
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,720
it had good potency not the best yield

554
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,919
but

555
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,640
i think overall uh it's one of my faves

556
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,960
off this list oh there you go i was

557
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,480
gonna dis it slightly because i know i

558
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,798
just saw a bunch of

559
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,798
lo of midi midzie before we called

560
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,558
things mids uh midzie outdoor yeah and i

561
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,960
i would think it could be very midi

562
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,798
outdoor it was not that it was not i

563
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,519
never saw the greatest examples but then

564
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,879
there you go you know

565
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,720
um how about

566
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,559
i have no experience with real albert

567
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
walker but i did get the [ __ ] fake

568
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,240
albert walker have you grown albert

569
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,720
walker i don't know that i grew the real

570
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,599
albert albert walker but i do think that

571
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,400
was a pretty flavorful and potent cut

572
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,158
yeah

573
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
i know fletch has a lot of familiarity

574
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,440
with it fletch would be an excellent

575
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,879
person to chat about the history of it

576
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,600
that's one that like

577
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,760
not

578
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,639
my none of my old crew

579
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,400
uh or really had any access to it you

580
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,520
know yeah i think there was one friend

581
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,440
of mine that might have been growing it

582
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,798
for a bit but it wasn't it wasn't too

583
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,360
much

584
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,679
okay um now this is one that a lot of

585
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,759
people are familiar with from um

586
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
oh what the [ __ ] dutch flowers their

587
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,759
work with it the blue dot

588
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,798
oh

589
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,720
i know there was two the blue dot uh i

590
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,158
am familiar with that that stuff there

591
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,038
was this guy

592
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,159
oh my god does he go by crunch bubble

593
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,679
uh

594
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,679
there was a guy on the forums you could

595
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,720
probably search for him or whatever and

596
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,880
uh the blue dot was one of the big

597
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,360
strains that used to get pushed through

598
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,919
grown in oakland a lot and it was pushed

599
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,918
through one of the early uh dispensaries

600
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,520
that we called the third floor that's

601
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,440
what it was third floor third floor

602
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,759
which was a pretty famous dispensary

603
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,400
back then in the east bay

604
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,200
um a lot of people got their purple cuts

605
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,159
from the third floor they were very tied

606
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,319
into my area to humboldt and and mundo

607
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,159
and stuff like that they got a hold of

608
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,158
like the the granddaddy and the urkel

609
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,880
and stuff like that and yeah crunch

610
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,200
bubble from icmag he used to blow up

611
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,600
tons of blue dot back in the day

612
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,759
um it was a nice cut i never ran it

613
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,038
personally but there it was like it was

614
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:16,079
one of those like bay area specials yeah

615
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,640
it really got rocked a lot um and i

616
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,558
think it was part of blowfish if i

617
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,159
remember he used to he that guy used to

618
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,480
send it you know you know you have like

619
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,240
40 lighters or whatever and yeah early

620
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
warehouses with like do you remember

621
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,038
like all the old like skinny rectangle

622
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,600
sunlight hoods oh yeah you know with

623
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,158
like the with the single ended 600 watt

624
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,240
hortolux hell yeah you know and like the

625
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,640
trays and all that like that was like

626
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,159
cutting edge of the time yeah um but you

627
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,080
know he had he had some you know pretty

628
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,919
good sized scenes or whatever that and

629
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,960
and there was like a huge demand for

630
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,000
blue dot

631
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,360
yeah so

632
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,119
uh i don't have a bunch of personal

633
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,879
experience growing it but i mean i would

634
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,599
get bags of it on occasion going to the

635
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,080
bay um and it was definitely like it was

636
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,879
a bay area classic

637
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,960
for a period of years

638
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,919
yeah someone just said i do think that

639
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,038
green crack is a fino of skunk one

640
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,280
um

641
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,079
you know at least it's it's heavily in

642
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,960
there

643
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,558
yeah

644
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,558
and put it that way

645
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,200
yeah i could see that definitely i mean

646
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,798
the mango that loud mango turf i usually

647
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,240
associate with skunk one touch stuff as

648
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,519
it is

649
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,400
um

650
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,400
blue [ __ ] dream

651
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,640
blue dream

652
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,360
so blue dream is one of those things

653
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,679
that

654
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,719
has a bad reputation

655
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,840
um

656
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,600
mostly because

657
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,158
uh anything that could get eight to ten

658
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,519
pounds at you know five let's say five

659
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,120
to ten pounds be a little bit more

660
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,319
generous anything that could get five to

661
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,399
ten pounds

662
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,678
outdoor reliably

663
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,840
um got blown up in my neck of the woods

664
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,080
and so if you to me if you grow blue

665
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,240
dream in like a little pot and you get

666
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,558
like a four to eight or ten ounce plant

667
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,319
or something it's really flavy and

668
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,399
really pretty wheat

669
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,759
yeah but most people's opinion of blue

670
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,640
dream is this giant outdoor

671
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,839
sort of b grade maybe poorly dried

672
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,360
um you know rock hard buds the terps

673
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,759
aren't really there

674
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,199
um but you know it kind of got famous

675
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,359
because

676
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,600
um you know people used to go with blue

677
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,519
dream billionaire right where back when

678
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,719
weed was worth a lot you could put out a

679
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:29,119
99 blue dreams and get 700 pounds

680
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,600
yeah wow

681
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,519
that's sweet [ __ ] yeah so there's it's

682
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,558
there's this run with blue dream green

683
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,798
crack even my maui a little bit where

684
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,879
um it's really big yielding

685
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,798
and then most people smoke the big

686
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,120
yielding stuff

687
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,000
and don't smoke like the little more

688
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:51,038
carefully grown nicer versions

689
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,159
yeah so their memory of it is uh

690
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,640
is just the big blown out crazy nugs

691
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,880
that are b grade so another thing that i

692
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
remember with blue dream during that era

693
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
was that a lot of people when it first

694
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,319
popped off were growing one cut there

695
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,278
was one blue dream cut that was going

696
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,119
around it was pretty pretty well um

697
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,278
passed out like people a lot of people

698
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,278
had this cut was being blown out of

699
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,798
collectives and it was pretty damn i

700
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,558
mean good for the time it was very

701
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,400
resonance had good potency good yield uh

702
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,759
didn't mold up too easy none of the

703
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,120
stuff that you know would normally keep

704
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,919
stuff down but after that big huge first

705
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,439
push seed lines were released named blue

706
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,159
dream by

707
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,640
emerald triangle seeds i think hso put

708
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,960
out a blue dream and those quickly

709
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,759
quickly were picked up and run

710
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,159
and those cuts were passed as blue dream

711
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,079
and the original cut was quickly drowned

712
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,919
out by um

713
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:50,000
other blueberry haze type combos

714
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,559
i do think that that thing that matt

715
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,359
just described is actually a common

716
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,519
thing

717
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,399
that can happen to certain strains where

718
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,720
a strain gets named something

719
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,159
uh then it gets made named put into a

720
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,759
seed line

721
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
and then there's all these phenos

722
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,000
floating around that aren't the original

723
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,000
cut that made it famous yes

724
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,519
um you know so there was a bunch of

725
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,880
different blue dreams it was supposedly

726
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,558
blueberry but by some kind of haze

727
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,400
it was a super so the original cut was

728
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,359
super silver haze crosstalk dj short

729
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,440
blueberry yeah and and so

730
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,678
you know they uh but you know like i

731
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,519
said if you grew if you grew like a

732
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,960
little six or seven ounce plant of that

733
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,038
thing in your light depth or your

734
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,720
greenhouse or your indoor

735
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,599
it was really nice weed

736
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,240
yeah it was i like it i i still like it

737
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,399
um our buddy pat works with it currently

738
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,720
he did the blue dream train wreck hybrid

739
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,440
for all of us older heads that's like

740
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,880
phenomenal and cool

741
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,080
yeah i mean

742
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,559
yeah good

743
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,480
i was just going to say that you know

744
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,000
the first time i really showed my face

745
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,558
on any of these things was when our

746
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,079
buddy uh csi asked me to do an event

747
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,399
that he was throwing up in humboldt and

748
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:05,199
i went and i was on a panel with

749
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,880
him and um uh you know mean gene and uh

750
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,120
kevin jodrey and just different folks

751
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
you know yeah um and he talked about

752
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,639
like you know train wreck

753
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
for northern humboldt was one of like

754
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,000
the first

755
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,599
named cuts

756
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
you know the wrath

757
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,240
yeah the wreck you yeah so there's a lot

758
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,038
of legends with the wreck because it was

759
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,079
uh

760
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,440
it was you know it was

761
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,038
i don't know if i don't know if santa

762
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,360
cruz original haze that's a whole

763
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,480
different movie uh blue dream is

764
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:37,278
super silver haze is a much much uh uh

765
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,038
changed child of haze

766
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,960
i see i think what select genetics 2 is

767
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,798
referring to is again there were several

768
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,558
different seed lines uh unknown

769
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,319
undisclosed haze so

770
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,079
most people would agree that that blue

771
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,599
hen from um what are they called can

772
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,678
tucky see i can't remember off the top

773
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,158
of my head but blue hen was the super

774
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,960
silver haze 98 blueberry probably where

775
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,720
it was selected from um but it was also

776
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,159
widely grown other

777
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
than that under the name blue pen as

778
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,640
well but the very first santa cruz cut

779
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,398
blue dream which still exists is a super

780
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
silver haze cross that's the one we're

781
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,759
referring to specifically and it's tasty

782
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,278
not everybody likes the high um

783
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,119
and if you grow it too big it definitely

784
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,599
is shitty but i think that's true of a

785
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,599
lot of weed yeah there's a sweet spot of

786
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,879
yield and quality

787
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,879
yeah you know bluegrass seed there you

788
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,320
go thank you cameron bluegrass seeds

789
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,159
yeah there's there's definitely a sweet

790
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,240
spot it's not all the same sweet spot

791
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,159
with strains but there's definitely a

792
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
point of diminishing returns as you get

793
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
bigger and bigger plants where it just

794
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,278
doesn't give you as nice of weed

795
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,360
yeah

796
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,359
you know so next would be bubble gum

797
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,480
bubble gum i am i i did i had a lot of

798
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,240
experience with a lot of other bubble

799
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,640
gums in the seed line but this this

800
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,440
specific clone i didn't get until a few

801
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,240
years ago and i find it phenomenal it's

802
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,278
an amazing breeder uh it's mold

803
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,200
resistant this specific cup that csi and

804
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,720
pip and all those guys use came via 1995

805
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
from the cup i believe it was bought the

806
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,640
same year that it won the cup so uh

807
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,399
that's that's what goes around it's a

808
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,840
serious it's a selection from series

809
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:15,839
seeds bubble gum the bummer for me

810
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,000
it's a great breeder yeah it's very

811
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,199
frosty yeah that's fairly potent i

812
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
wouldn't say it's

813
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
like

814
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,720
i wouldn't say it's up there with the

815
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,158
best of the best but it's got it's got a

816
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,839
good little punch

817
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,159
uh the disappointing thing about it to

818
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:31,918
me is that it smells

819
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,399
very strongly of bubble gum terps yes um

820
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,399
but the flavor does not translate for me

821
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,719
not even a little bit yeah i don't you

822
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,398
don't get any it doesn't it smells like

823
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,319
you're smelling big league chew

824
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,839
yeah but it doesn't smell like you're

825
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,839
chewing it doesn't feel like you're

826
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,839
chewing big leg chew when you smoke it

827
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,278
yeah but it's a great breeder it's super

828
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,199
consistent it's one of the most mold

829
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,679
resistant things out there

830
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,399
um it's a cool plant yeah

831
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,240
yeah arrowhead hemp farms yes indiana is

832
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,479
serious seeds it is a serious seed

833
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,399
selection though a lot of people put the

834
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,839
indiana bubble gum as the mother of

835
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,519
serious seeds that they use but that's

836
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,038
not the case it was actually a selection

837
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,879
from their

838
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,798
seat line and if we want to go even back

839
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,320
further there's you know adam dunn has

840
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,200
this whole thing about where it came

841
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,439
from

842
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,640
um you know neville felt like they just

843
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,519
stole it

844
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,600
from

845
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,679
working with him yeah and renamed it

846
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,439
that it was it was some big buds it was

847
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,480
some combination of stuff that he was

848
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,798
already working on yeah um you know um

849
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,120
so there's there's dispute over where

850
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,960
where where it came from yeah and that

851
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,719
happens a lot where people try to

852
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,038
obscure origins

853
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,880
yeah definitely that's a a common thing

854
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,798
you know so

855
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,640

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,319
writer it's very different um well betsy

866

867
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,759
writer

868
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,000
we still have uh old betsy still exists

869
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,879
and is still held and run by multiple

870
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,398
friends

871
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,159
and crew

872
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,319
um and it's supposed to be a sister of

873
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,320
the original bull liar i don't know that

874
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,480
matter i know anyone that has original

875
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,639
bull rider that we believe

876
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,558
not that we're sure of but old betsy

877
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,080
exists and who knows it could exist

878
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,759
outside of our our experience

879
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,319
it definitely could exist but i haven't

880
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:36,720
seen it a lot of people made uh

881
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,960
a lot of claims about it recently but

882
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,640
none hold up and most are uh based on

883
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,079
the afghanistan maybe i should say

884
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,679
something just real quick one time when

885
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,158
i was in chicago

886
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,440
uh before i moved to california i saw

887
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,519
some bubble gum

888
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,080
um that they had bought from out there

889
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,880
uh and brought back and it had uh hot

890
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:57,678
pink hairs and was lime green

891
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,600
um and was super gorgeous

892
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,200
uh i never really saw it again i only

893
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,439
saw it a few times who knows who was

894
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,759
growing it back then but i did see

895
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,798
a very cool version of it a long time

896
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,720
ago uh when sirius first released it

897
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,879
yeah

898
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,000
so um yeah that we went through bull

899
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,760
rider bubble gum banana oh gee do you

900
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,599
have any i know you've grown banana og

901
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,720
do you have any uh memorable experiences

902
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,158
with it i do actually think that

903
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
you know a lot of these things

904
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,320
especially in dessert and uh and fruit

905
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,839
names now annoy the [ __ ] out of me

906
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,278
because they have no relation what

907
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,278
they're marketing

908
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,599
they have no relation to whatever they

909
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,599
name them after but i do think banana og

910
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,879
does have a little bit of banana terp to

911
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,119
it yes

912
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,440
you know i i will say that i will say

913
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,119
it's it does have i get a banana sense

914
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,600
when i smoked it

915
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,879
uh it's an odd og i don't really know

916
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,119
what to make of it

917
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,720
um the oregon kid or somebody like that

918
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,518
made it famous it's not really my

919
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,519
background on that one so banana og came

920
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,200
from a pack of oh jeer's kush his

921
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,919
original release of what he wanted to be

922
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,759
the ogco seedline um

923
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,720
no chiquita banana is not the original

924
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,480
game way later and as a rename um so he

925
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,440
got it as

926
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,159
uh

927
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,558
the og kush the the clone that he had

928
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,360
and he got he selected a male from

929
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,200
some

930
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,479
i think it was an indoor

931
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,558
um 60 40 from segrematha which meant 60

932
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,278
sativa 40 indica i remember that line

933
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,200
yeah yeah he popped those and i've asked

934
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,720
um tony from secret math of what it was

935
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,480
and he said it was just something he

936
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,240
bought and bulk from someone he didn't

937
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,000
know it was just labeled 60 40 so he

938
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,079
knew exactly what it was so anyways

939
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,480
whatever was in the 60 40 kicked

940
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,798
whatever would be true for these banana

941
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,278
terps so he released ogiers kush

942
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,119
expecting it to be a good version og

943
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,240
kush and that's where people found this

944
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,239
beautiful clone that was very

945
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,839
banana-like and later on you know as

946
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,278
people pop more seeds more people found

947
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,918
different clones they would call banana

948
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,679
og there's one that circulates right now

949
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,440
that most people have is the same one

950
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,880
and it's very good there's a few more

951
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,399
that are more laffy taffy like

952
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,880
artificial banana type and that's what

953
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,959
you smell um i've smelled one banana

954
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,760
hybrid from um

955
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,679
uh pico our buddy and it smelled like

956
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,440
[ __ ] banana bread like just dead on

957
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,679
like that banana cinnamon it's one of

958
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,679
the the most amazing banana smelling

959
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
things that i've ever smelled so i'll

960
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,720
throw in something that's uh

961
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,119
kind of related um you know

962
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,039
before uh there used to be in the in the

963
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,679
40s 50s and 60s

964
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:30,320
um the banana the banana that everyone

965
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,720
ate was a different banana fino that you

966
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,838
eat than you eat now yeah and it was

967
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,078
destroyed by root fungus

968
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,918
right it had a much different flavor

969
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,320
than the current banana that everybody

970
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,878
has grown up with but what's interesting

971
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,960
is kind of how banana candy tastes a

972
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:50,000
little different than you would expect

973
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,519
it to taste like it's banana but it like

974
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it's kind of you think of it as like

975
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,878
candy candy banana yeah

976
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,800
that flavor was was developed off the

977
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,400
first bananas that were commercially

978
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,440
sold in america

979
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,920
yeah

980
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,039
and they didn't change it

981
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,880
you know

982
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,079
yep right there there you go the

983
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,079
cavendish

984
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
the so most banana candy is based on the

985
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,079
flavor of the cavendish banana not the

986
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,358
modern banana that everybody is used to

987
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,280
eating

988
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,519
and you know i actually owe a great deal

989
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,000
of my career to the banana og and some

990
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,239
of oregon kids stuff and uh tony from

991
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,159
sacramento stuff it still lives on today

992
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,239
and a lot of strains that i work with

993
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,039
and the others work with so banana og is

994
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,199
the [ __ ] i think i like it though i will

995
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,719
say in a lot of outcrosses depending on

996
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,639
what you cross it to there are phenos

997
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,118
that are just straight cardboard and

998
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:42,000
they're hard to dodge um

999
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,240
but that clone stands the test of time i

1000
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,599
think for sure it's a it's a good one it

1001
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,759
kind of got buried a little bit and it

1002
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,838
got lost amongst other things but it's

1003
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,240
it's a it's a cool unique terp and it

1004
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,078
had a nice buzz yeah

1005
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,399
so you know

1006
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,560
here's a fun one that that

1007
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,800
probably is is actually several

1008
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,639
different different clones or seed lines

1009
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,079
okay hold on one second

1010
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,400
these guys are correct actually the

1011
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,920
cavendish replaced the

1012
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,680
i was off the top of my head they're

1013
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,280
talking about which banana cultivars

1014
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:15,598
existed and i got it reversed uh okay so

1015
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,839
the cavendish was the first and and uh

1016
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,039
the cavendish is now and it replaced

1017
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,320
this thing i don't know how to pronounce

1018
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,838
it but it was like gross macau or

1019
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,359
something like that

1020
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,799
so

1021
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,039
yeah someone keeps asking about the

1022
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,440
chiquita that was the chiquita banana

1023
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,519
was uh popped from the platinum banana

1024
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,358
og kush which was a hybrid of bubba kush

1025
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,440
something in banana og

1026
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,199
and it came i mean that was so much

1027
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,800
later because it was from my work and it

1028
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,759
was later

1029
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,359
like

1030
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,839
seven years after i made the platinum

1031
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,920
banana og and my work was so much later

1032
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,920
after oregon kid did so no it's it

1033
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,440
they're very different but um the

1034
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,358
chiquita banana is based on if it has a

1035
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,960
lot more in it

1036
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,039
okay what's next

1037
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,599
cat piss again

1038
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,440
many many different clones i think i saw

1039
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,440
several in san diego

1040
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,039
called cat piss that were very different

1041
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,358
from each other some i didn't smell any

1042
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,759
catfish in some people did

1043
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:10,799
what's your experience uh well i'll say

1044
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,440
a couple things uh one is that you know

1045
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,400
i think that it's one of those aspects

1046
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,400
of smell that people relate stuff to

1047
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,800
so i think it's like i think it's like i

1048
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,160
think it's like how some people perceive

1049
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,920
certain kinds of terpenoline yeah right

1050
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,078
um and since terpenoline is kind of a

1051
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,320
common aroma that pops up i think

1052
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,400
there's more than one cat piss

1053
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,838
uh and i do believe we're going to have

1054
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,760
uh sha bud on the on the

1055
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,440
program year

1056
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,440
in the next couple of weeks

1057
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,000
and so we could probably save the deep

1058
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,800
dive into cat kiss for him

1059
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,480
because that is one of his specialties

1060
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,800
and he knows an enormous amount about

1061
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,960
the history and he's tried all the

1062
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,400
different ones there was a san diego cat

1063
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,720
piss there was a pittsburgh cat piss

1064
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,358
um there was different types

1065
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,559
yeah um you know but uh you know so

1066
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:01,519
there were there was a few different

1067
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,559
names

1068
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,480
yeah one second i'm bringing in someone

1069
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,960
if he wants to

1070
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,440
see how he's doing

1071
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,480
all right what is cheetahpis who [ __ ]

1072
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,320
knows

1073
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,440
this is so other than having the name

1074
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,920
pissing it

1075
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,400
um you know that's marketing that's like

1076
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
a cookie team coming up with marketing

1077
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,160
names cookie

1078
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,320
never really has any names that tie to

1079
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,639
what this strain is actually like yeah

1080
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,000
um they definitely have a team of

1081
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,639
marketing people

1082
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,400
deciding what to call things and what

1083
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,078
kind of art goes with it and what the

1084
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,240
packaging is going to look like and what

1085
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,400
the mylars are going to be

1086
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,358
um so they're a very new school type of

1087
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,160
approach to naming strains

1088
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,559
so

1089
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,639
it's all good gene you can text

1090
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,920
if you're so every time uh

1091
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,000
what's next

1092
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,599
um someone asked if any ssh smells like

1093
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,679
catfish yes i mean yeah that's a great

1094
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,838
example of terpenoline i have baptisy

1095
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,879
smells i have argued if you go and read

1096
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:03,039
like a bunch of neville's uh old posts

1097
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,119
on hazes he'll talk about when you

1098
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,880
inbreed haze all you get is a bunch of

1099
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,000
cat piss yes

1100
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,838
and when we in breed haze all we get is

1101
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,480
a bunch of terpenoline

1102
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,799
and as any breeder will tell you once

1103
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,159
terpentaline becomes the dominant smell

1104
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,280
in your strain

1105
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,399
boy is it hard to get other smells to

1106
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
pop up

1107
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,039
yeah

1108
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,720
you know it is very very very dominant

1109
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,159
yeah now there's different terpeneleans

1110
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,598
they're not all the same some are sweet

1111
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,960
some are astringent

1112
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,320
you know some are this or that or

1113
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,119
whatever there's definitely a range

1114
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,960
interpenaline there but um but yeah i

1115
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,720
when whenever neville talks about cat

1116
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,880
piss i think of of turpentine yeah and i

1117
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,118
do too i mean i know there's afghanis

1118
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,480
that are acrid and ammonia type and

1119
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,760
that's what i used to think of when

1120
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,599
people would say pissy i would think of

1121
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,560
the acrid ammonia urea type smells but i

1122
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,240
think a lot of people think of

1123
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,159
terpenolamine meaning i just my nose

1124
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,919
does not pick up that piss scent from

1125
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,118
tropinally and then when you you know

1126
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,280
the other part of it is like once you

1127
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,039
when you grow or you smoke c5 or

1128
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,880
something like that and it's just a

1129
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,039
terpenoline monster

1130
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,760
yeah and he refers to it as very cat

1131
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,519
pissy yeah then obviously that's what

1132
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,480
his mind goes to

1133
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,759
yeah

1134
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,719
you know

1135
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,040
so

1136
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,799
okay um next the cheese

1137
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,279
the cheese so

1138
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,039
the cheese has a pretty cool story

1139
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,680
yeah it might be

1140
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,039
the oldest skunk one fino that's spread

1141
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,399
around

1142
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,519
yeah it's supposed to be from the late

1143
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,920
80s

1144
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,318
uh it's it's supposed to be popped by

1145
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,200
sort of like a bunch of would you call

1146
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,559
them punk anarchist squatters

1147
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,679
supposed to be i don't know much about

1148
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,318
the crew i thought they were supposed to

1149
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:49,199
be ravers or some electronics same thing

1150
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:53,119
yeah same thing you know i mean when

1151
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:55,358
anarchists you know like punks ravers

1152
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,960
uh underground weirdos listening to

1153
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,119
unpopular music yeah you know yeah type

1154
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,480
of thing but skunk but it was a phenom

1155
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,000
of skunk one and most skunk one

1156
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,199
uh is citrus or

1157
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,519
floral

1158
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,639
uh sometimes grape

1159
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,159
uh

1160
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,318
never skunk

1161
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,039
and the rarest would be probably the

1162
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:22,159
kind of a funky cheese yeah

1163
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:25,358
aroma yeah and so there's a sister of it

1164
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:28,318
supposedly called psychosis yeah which

1165
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,000
is not nearly as circulated uh you know

1166
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,519
the english are all big on it because

1167
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,039
it's one of the few things that actually

1168
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:37,358
originated from their island yeah

1169
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,800
the blues livers psychosis and there's

1170
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,199
another one too that they always used to

1171
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,440
talk about and and i really i'd love to

1172
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,480
grow them one day but i have never been

1173
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,159
um

1174
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,920
where i could get it from uh

1175
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,159
from a source with provenance i've only

1176
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,838
gotten it from like seed lines or

1177
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,679
you know and it's one of those cuts that

1178
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,519
different people give different names to

1179
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,598
like the bright side cut or the this

1180
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,920
yeah that cut you know that kind of

1181
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,200
thing but it's basically

1182
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,159
it's basically a classic skunk one yes

1183
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,919
yeah you know um the other thing i will

1184
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,879
say about is i learned a lot from that

1185
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,358
cut

1186
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,599
a huge amount from that [ __ ] cut i

1187
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,358
learned that it was one of those cuts

1188
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,200
that like early on growing it it was

1189
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,719
really foot funky cheese for me so as i

1190
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,639
got it later and it was fruity and sweet

1191
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,399
i was like no wait this is a [ __ ]

1192

fake cut [ __ ] this thing this is not

1193

what i remember and it was one of those

1194
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,199
cuts that really taught me um

1231
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,519
um someone mentioned one that we

1232
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,880
actually i should have put on the list

1233
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,159
but i didn't and that's blackberry

1234
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,000
did you ever have any experience with

1235
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,960
blackberry up there not blackberry kush

1236
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,639
but just blackberry uh

1237
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,000
we had more with blackberry kush

1238
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,078
although i always thought it was just

1239
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,920
blackberry and people added kush to it

1240
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,519
because at the time all these brokers

1241
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,039
wanted kush so it's like here's your

1242
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,280
purple kush

1243
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,279
yeah um the original blackberry was a

1244
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
lot different from the the blackberry

1245
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,920
kush the blackberry kush was a white

1246
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,640
rhino bubba hybrid from oregon kid um

1247
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,639
the original blackberry was from um a

1248
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,879
dude named soma blaze if i remember

1249
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,440
correctly scott some ablaze and he ended

1250
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,400
up passing away um naboo ended up

1251
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,679
kind of carrying on the torch of it and

1252
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,000
you know there were a lot of beautiful

1253
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,399
pictures i think in one of these can of

1254
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,318
bibles if i can pull it up super fast

1255
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,318
has a beautiful picture of it uh there's

1256
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:41,759
a real famous picture of it inside of a

1257
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:45,519
jar of um like blackberry preserves

1258
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,280
uh that was really famous of it um

1259
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,358
at the time there wasn't a lot of

1260
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,839
colored weed

1261
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:54,400
so it stood out very much so

1262
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:56,318
and it was it was used a lot in a lot of

1263
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,440
the hybrids that were famous from that

1264
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,400
point on

1265
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,079
um because it bred true for whatever its

1266
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,760
purple traits were

1267
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,359
for a long time it you know people

1268
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,599
thought it was different from the mendo

1269
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,199
perps but i think later on people

1270
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,240
realized that there was a good chance it

1271
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,759
was a a bag seed for mendo perps and i

1272
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,159
think that's kind of where we're at oh

1273
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,520
man if nebu had a voodoo doll right now

1274
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,279
you'd be

1275
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,519
the jungler vein

1276
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,319
he would he would he would be really

1277
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:27,759
upset but it does seem like the timeline

1278
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:28,880
uh is is correct yes you know

1279
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,800
the one thing i'll say about the

1280
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,400
blackberry whether it was blackberry or

1281
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,000
blackberry kush

1282
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,358
um both of them were pretty weak

1283
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,079
potency-wise yeah hello mitsy fam

1284
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,358
i don't i wouldn't say midzie but not

1285
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,440
potent

1286
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,920
no i yeah it was very hard to get high

1287
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,679
from that stuff you know if that was if

1288
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,838
if that was the only thing in your jar

1289
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,279
you better have a light potency a light

1290
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,239
tolerance i should say if you want to

1291
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,839
get anywhere on it for me yeah yeah

1292
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,318
for me too and

1293
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,519
yeah blackberry push especially i had a

1294
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,119
very hard time it was beautiful too

1295
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,318
because it was super resonance and it

1296
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,960
was one of those things that i always

1297
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,719
put in my head as like that was some

1298
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,318
beautiful looking weed and when you pick

1299
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,000
it up you see all that resin it was the

1300
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,559
it was the it was the [ __ ] that taught

1301
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,760
me pretty [ __ ] frosty weed doesn't

1302
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,440
necessarily mean you're gonna get [ __ ]

1303
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,119
up for me

1304
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,559
uh blackberry kush was the kind of thing

1305
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,880
that brokers would come up here and

1306
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,400
freak out on and buy a [ __ ] ton of

1307
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,318
yeah once

1308
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,400
yeah once yeah and then they wouldn't

1309
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,960
they wouldn't move it they would like no

1310
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,720
i got way too many complaints it was too

1311
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,079
like people want to get high

1312
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,318
and some people are comparing it to

1313
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,640
purple punch but um

1314
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,400
purple punch has i think personally

1315
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,639
great terps and i would say blackberry

1316
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,960
kush really was not on the great terp

1317
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,279
range no and we didn't even call there

1318
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,679
was no terps then that was even that was

1319
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,280
even before most uh the the revolution

1320
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,838
of hashish that happened again with all

1321
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,240
the nails and all that so it never got

1322
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,000
the it never really got the

1323
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,279
i don't know it was it was bumped in

1324
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,920
mendo for a time but yeah yeah whatever

1325
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,280
okay here's your your your favorite

1326
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,039
kim dog

1327
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,480
i think we started covering some of it

1328
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:10,559
so go ahead the cam dog you know yeah i

1329
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,760
mean you know it was uh it's one of

1330
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,119
those things where it's been talked

1331
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:18,160
about tons by various people myself uh

1332
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,838
our buddy skunk va and all that

1333
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:23,039
um i would say that the best thing you

1334
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:25,838
could say about chemdawg is that it is

1335
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:29,039
it's got rare potency

1336
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:32,000
uh very rare potency and the potency

1337
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,880
tends to be dominant and translate into

1338
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,199
lots of hybrids that you make with it

1339
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,200
so it makes up for be and strangely it

1340
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,759
doesn't look very resinous

1341
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:44,159
uh it's not very pretty it sort of looks

1342
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,359
to me like ancient um

1343
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,000
it's you know it's like some kind of

1344
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:51,199
ancient ugly afghan yeah i think it's

1345
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,960
hideous and in like i see the skunky a

1346
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,199
crazy composer those two can make that

1347
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,199
[ __ ] look so pretty i i don't know how

1348
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,199
they do it but most grows like even my

1349
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,000
grows of it i see it is just

1350
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:04,000
cannibalizing its own leaves oh it does

1351
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,199
i mean that that actually yeah sour does

1352
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,838
the same thing as that and that's kind

1353
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,239
of why i think but they um there's an

1354
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,759
aspect to that where a lot of i'll say

1355
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,679
this and this might piss some people off

1356
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,319
or whatever but uh

1357
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,159
there's a lot of people that are taking

1358
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,719
we would always take the

1359
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:22,639
the dog to like say 10 weeks

1360
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:25,759
yeah right and that's when we kind of

1361
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:27,838
somewhere between 65 and 72 or 73 days

1362
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,480
depending on how long you could let it

1363
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,318
rock you know yeah and uh

1364
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,280
you know it would test somewhere between

1365
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:37,199
you know 18 and 22 or 23 then but it

1366
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,880
knocked your head off yeah and then when

1367
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,598
all this testing [ __ ] came into

1368
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,480
effect they realized that that was too

1369
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,720
low

1370
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,599
yeah and so some people started cutting

1371
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:50,159
it at like 53 54 days and you can see

1372
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,920
white hairs all over it but it'll test

1373
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:54,239
at 29

1374
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,880
yeah and then so the grower gets to grow

1375
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,039
it quicker and turn it quicker

1376
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,240
and then the dispensary is happy because

1377
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:04,079
it gets to put this high thc label on it

1378
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,239
and a lot of people end up on the legal

1379
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,280
market these days buying premature chem

1380
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,639
dog in my opinion yeah

1381
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,400
yeah i don't care

1382
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,279
i care what it does to my head

1383
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,318
yeah

1384
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,240
yeah so

1385
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,519
it would be nice if it had flavor too

1386
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:18,799
that helps

1387
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,719
sometimes this is what i'll say

1388
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,680
sometimes and this is just my personal

1389
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,719
opinion

1390
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,598
sometimes

1391
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:28,078
chem dog has amazing flavor

1392
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,559
yeah really deep flavor that i love and

1393
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,480
i can smell it in the weed and it ca and

1394
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,880
that smell translates

1395
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,358
and like i grow chem dog all the time

1396
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,119
and maybe one or two rips a year

1397
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,078
it gives me that flavor

1398
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,160
yeah

1399
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,920
and i have tried a million different

1400
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,279
ways to figure out whether it's heat

1401
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,039
whether it's newt whether it's this

1402
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,119
whether it's that i've grown salt i've

1403
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,719
grown it organic i've grown it every

1404
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,800
which way you can imagine

1405
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,279
yeah this is finicky sometimes it gives

1406
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,599
me the flav sometimes

1407
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,720
the potency is almost always there

1408
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,039
yeah it's it it the potency and the high

1409
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,358
is pretty is pretty standard

1410
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,440
yeah the closest i've seen of that chirp

1411
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,920
extreme was from and i always talk about

1412
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,480
this but like it i

1413
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,519
like i didn't get the love for chem 91

1414
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,679
or the dog as you guys called it until i

1415
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,759
smoked a chem 91 hybrid that he had made

1416
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,679
that was very chem 91 dominant in the

1417
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,440
terp but it was just turned to a 10. i

1418
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,358
imagine it's probably how chem 91 was

1419
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,838
when you guys first started growing it

1420
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,159
and um i understood the love for it

1421
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:32,000
after that because that that tur profile

1422
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:33,759
is [ __ ] nice and it's very unique

1423
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,400
i've never smelled anything close to it

1424
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,880
it uh it's in there it's just hard to

1425
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,119
coax out and it does do this thing where

1426
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,800
you can grow it perfectly organic or

1427
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,720
chem what you know uh whatever you want

1428
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,318
to do and a lot of the times it'll get

1429
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,000
this leaf rust and it'll start

1430
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,920
cannibalizing its leaves and i'll start

1431
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,639
dying i'll start looking like [ __ ]

1432
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,559
yeah um the butt itself usually stays

1433
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:57,118
perfectly fine yeah

1434
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,800
you know but uh but yeah it's rough i

1435
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,480
see i see a lot of those endless white

1436
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,839
pistols on it too just like no matter

1437
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,039
what people do it just will keep

1438
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,279
throwing white

1439
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,558
or stigma so i'll throw i'll throw out

1440
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,240
something interesting when you used to

1441
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,359
grow it under like hortolox or your

1442
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:14,239
standard whatever yeah it would take 80

1443
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:16,159
it would take 70 like i said 68 72 days

1444
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,838
something like that right yeah i grew a

1445
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,239
bunch of my favorite head stash under

1446
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,639
pure ceramic metal halides like a blend

1447
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,598
of the 31 and the 42

1448
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:28,558
and the dog [ __ ] got done two weeks

1449
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:32,079
earlier yeah and i pulled the chem the

1450
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,480
chem 91 at 87 days and it still had

1451
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,079
white hairs all over it yeah so it did

1452
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,159
this weird thing where the spectrum made

1453
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,200
this sativa finish two weeks faster than

1454
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,358
i'm used to

1455
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,199
yeah and then made the dog go two and a

1456
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,119
half weeks longer than i've ever seen it

1457
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,199
and it still wasn't done that's super

1458
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,440
weird who the [ __ ] knows why that is you

1459
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,598
know yeah but yeah i mean i've been i've

1460
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,280
been growing it since 1998 it's one of

1461
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,359
my favorite strains so i usually have

1462
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,359
one or two at least going for head yeah

1463
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:00,078
so i've grown it a lot

1464
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,199
okay next up your second favorite maybe

1465
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,160
chem d

1466
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:02,960
kim d

1467
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,078
yeah

1468
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,119
uh chem d chem d is cool you know uh

1469
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,920
chem d has a different high than chem 91

1470
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:14,880
it's prettier it's frostier much

1471
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,400
prettier it smells people's

1472
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,760
call it you know i don't know what you

1473
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:23,440
call it roadkill or dead bodies or

1474
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,359
some kind of like decrepit funk i i

1475
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,599
always refer to it as like bad breath to

1476
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,598
me but what's weird about it is that i

1477
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,039
can crack a jar six feet away from

1478
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,240
someone and they'll be like who's got

1479
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,318
the skunk yeah but i've also smelled

1480
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,399
baby [ __ ] come out of it like pure

1481
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:40,400
putrid baby [ __ ] but it has a lot of

1482
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,639
expressions yeah but then you get close

1483
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,680
to it and you can't smell that skunk yes

1484
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,838
you just smell the putrid yes you know

1485
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,558
um and i think i think it's a i think

1486
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,920
it's a i think it's a hybrid honestly of

1487
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,119
this might get me in trouble but i think

1488
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,760
it's a hybrid of chem 91 and uh super

1489
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,920
skunk yes um and i think the super skunk

1490
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,160
gives it its frost and its color it even

1491
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,200
herms kind of like the super skunk did

1492
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,199
yeah um and like i said uh the chem 91

1493
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:10,558
throws that crazy potency

1494
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,879
yeah um so it's a short squat afghan i

1495
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,680
would also say that uh there's three or

1496
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,920
four fakes that float around yes um and

1497
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,558
those fakes tended to get uh trade

1498
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,240
baited a lot more than the original cut

1499
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,559
so matt was talking about how certain

1500
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:25,439
cuts got buried by the wave of what came

1501
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,760
after

1502
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,960
yes lots and lots of people have fake

1503
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,040
candy

1504
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,199
everybody wanted d but not everybody had

1505
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:36,719
access to d but there was always a bunch

1506
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:38,399
of people willing to to to pass around

1507
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,639
fake versions of it for a little bit of

1508
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,720
tinga you know so and there's this thing

1509
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,480
too where it's like when i say trade

1510
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,159
baiting what matt and i mean when we

1511
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,719
talk about trade baiting is some people

1512
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:50,399
would go after cuts just to get certain

1513
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,719
things to be able to trade them for

1514
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,680
other things yes so like there was

1515
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,679
people like myself or skunk va or others

1516
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:58,639
that held on to the the chemd and had

1517
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,799
them and there's different people that

1518
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,318
had it and they held it kind of tight

1519
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,240
and then there were some people that got

1520
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:06,159
it just so they could use that cut to

1521
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:09,118
unlock a bunch of other cuts they wanted

1522
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,558
to get access to yes so they spread out

1523
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,400
and it just so happened that they got

1524
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,920
some fakes

1525
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,358
and even like some pretty reputable

1526
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,119
people that like are supposed to know a

1527
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,639
bunch got faced yeah so it was it was

1528
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,640
out there there was a bun there's a

1529
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,879
bunch of people and it can be really

1530
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:25,279
hard to tell in the bag

1531
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,519
what you know they look very similar

1532
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,000
side by side grows usually show you and

1533
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,920
to me the real d like it has a potency

1534
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,880
and a flavor the other ones don't

1535
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,039
yeah

1536
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,480
so there you go on that one

1537
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,000
i had no idea someone just said i have

1538
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,880
no idea if the gmo was made with the

1539
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,960
real chem i mean gmo was made in spain i

1540
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,760
think so i'm very doubtful that it was

1541
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,920
used it's a great gmo is a great cut on

1542
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,160
its own so yeah just kind of irrelevant

1543
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,720
in the sense that it works good it

1544
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:55,838
yields good it smokes good it

1545
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:58,639
washes good so you know it's a good cut

1546
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,400
yeah um and i i always like when i

1547
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,719
categorize it in my head i always refer

1548
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,599
to like the chem d i remember it as the

1549
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:08,239
more cushy looking one by its nature how

1550
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,559
it stacks and everything and the chem 2

1551
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:13,279
i always remember as the most cushy of

1552
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,079
the bunch it was more like little tiny

1553
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,798
nugs looking at all if i'm being real i

1554
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,880
think there's there's chem 91 in both

1555
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:23,519
sour diesel and in chem d

1556
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,358
yeah and chem d is sort of like a squat

1557
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,079
afghan version

1558
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:32,480
and saurs are sort of like a tall lanky

1559
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:35,519
colombian uh skunk type version yeah

1560
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,679
that's my that's my view okay chem dog

1561
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:40,239
number four

1562
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,558
chem dog number four is cool

1563
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:44,000
uh it's probably the most widely

1564
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,880
circulated

1565
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,519
chem

1566
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,960
yeah uh i would say i didn't see a lot

1567
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,358
of fake cuts

1568
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,960
there's not really fake cuts it yields

1569
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:53,838
like a champ

1570
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,519
um

1571
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:59,039
and uh

1572
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,920
it it reminds me a lot of nl5 haze

1573
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,719
yes

1574
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,559
um our buddy pip who we joke loves to

1575
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,159
take everything 12 weeks no matter how

1576
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,720
long it's supposed to take

1577
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:11,598
um i had him take a really nice nug of

1578
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:14,719
chem 4 and put it on top of a picture of

1579
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,160
neville's 1989 nl5 haze

1580
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:17,838
i have it on my phone i can't you know

1581
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:20,879
and but it's like it really is a dead

1582
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:21,920
ringer yeah um and i if i smoke enough

1583
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,480
chem d

1584
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,760
or chem 4 i get like a raciness in my

1585
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,719
chest

1586
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,240
yeah it has long running buds it's much

1587
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,000
taller

1588
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:35,519
uh the only thing i'll say about it is

1589
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,318
that uh it takes probably 12 weeks

1590
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,679
and a lot of people cut it at 10. yeah i

1591
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,079
think a lot of people were cutting it at

1592
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,078
eight to nine like in california so

1593
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,519
there's a there's a lot of chem d that

1594
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,280
doesn't make the cut

1595
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:49,679
um because most people don't want to

1596
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,079
take it that full 12 weeks

1597
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:54,318
i like that quote the blue dream of gas

1598
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,640
yes yeah but if you if you take if you

1599
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:58,798
take the chem for 84 days or something

1600
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,879
like that and you grow it nice it's it's

1601
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,039
really nice yeah and i would say no chem

1602
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,280
4 is probably one of the furthest from

1603
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,960
the original um

1604
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,680
it looks nothing like

1605
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,119
uh the the chem 91 actually chem one is

1606
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:12,879
probably the furthest from the original

1607
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,680
but tim ford definitely is very far from

1608
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,280
it indeed yeah um

1609
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,118
uh let's see

1610
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,519
we don't have to do the kim sister s1

1611
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,920
specifically let's do um we can do the

1612
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:25,759
kim sis real quick okay go ahead uh the

1613
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,599
kim sis is dead

1614
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:32,079
yes um it exists in a couple of s-ones

1615
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:34,400
one of them is called the bundy cut yeah

1616
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,760
one of them got traded as chem d all

1617
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,358
over the place

1618
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,280
uh mislabeled

1619
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:40,480
my buddy that i always call staten

1620
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,000
island

1621
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,440
confirmed that greg had both the sis and

1622
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,639
the dog

1623
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,559
in the early 90s yeah and he chose not

1624
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:52,838
to bring the sis west because he didn't

1625
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,760
like the high and it was ugly as [ __ ]

1626
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:57,759
yeah so there you go yeah that's that's

1627
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,599
good history on it you know

1628
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,440
um

1629
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,838
uh cherry slider do you have an

1630
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,159
experience with cherry slider no i came

1631
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:09,039
from a dude named skitty um it was it

1632
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,960
was from the early boards um

1633
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,480
i wasn't a big fan of it very leafy

1634
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,639
somebody just asked what does the chem

1635
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,920
sis skunk the a uses i think he uses the

1636
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,159
bundy cut

1637
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,559
which is a chem sis s1

1638
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:23,039
uh i talked to greg about the chem sis

1639
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,880
because it since it never came west

1640
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,679
uh with my buddy i never really had a

1641
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,519
bunch of uh access to it or anything and

1642
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,519
he told me as far as he knew the

1643
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:34,639
original was dead and there was only

1644
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,639
some bad seeds that existed so

1645
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,719
be that as it may

1646
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,000
all right um you ever [ __ ] with

1647
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,798
chocolate trip

1648
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,440
no

1649
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,719
no okay that was a dutch flowers cut um

1650
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,079
the one i grew is the one a lot of

1651
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,439
people grew and i thought it was like a

1652
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,960
c99 probably but no one's ever said that

1653
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,119
like i've never talked to anybody about

1654
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,599
it so maybe i'm just [ __ ] stupid one

1655
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,519
thing i'll say about dutch flowers

1656
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,039
is that i've always i've always i've

1657
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:00,960
said a bunch on this show that i thought

1658
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,199
that weed wasn't ready for modern day

1659
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,199
marketing techniques yeah because we're

1660
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:07,039
a bunch of like half autistic weirdos

1661
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,639
that hide out with plants but

1662
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,519
um you know

1663
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:13,679

trip or they're this or that and you'd

1668
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,759

1669
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,558

00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,679
professional ad guy in here and evoke

1678
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,558
some language

1679
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:48,639
yeah they use language very well

1680
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,440
they sure did um i collected their stuff

1681
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:53,039
heavily and even after i found out like

1682
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,440
by growing a bunch of it that it was

1683
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,199
really it was either just stuff renamed

1684
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,838
or just not very

1685
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,558
interesting you know

1686
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:04,000
um people are asking questions real

1687
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:06,640
quick that that are going way too fast

1688
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,920
so i'm apologize if if your question

1689
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:10,318
doesn't get picked up because we're

1690
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,200
trying to chat and whatnot

1691
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:13,199
um

1692
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:16,239
but i will say someone just mentioned

1693
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,118
pot of gold pot of gold was a uh

1694
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,679
um

1695
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,440
pot of gold and uh was it was one of my

1696
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:22,639
favorite probably my favorite thing that

1697
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,720
came from

1698
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:27,679
the flying dutchman

1699
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:30,159
and it was a hindu kush by skunk one

1700
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:31,759
yeah it was a very very flavorful strain

1701
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,000
i liked it a whole bunch they also had

1702
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,079
this other thing called the real mccoy

1703
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,480
which was a hawaiian biscuit they might

1704
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,400
be on the list but there's a it was a

1705
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,119
hawaiian by skunk one that was also

1706
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,039
super good um i liked both of those a

1707
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,920
bunch and then the final good question i

1708
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,880
thought was gravity from neville

1709
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,200
um

1710
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,920
we think although we're not sure

1711
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:57,838
it seems like gravity is unreleased

1712
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,838
versions of black domina

1713
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:06,239
uh so black domina was a scentsy release

1714
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:08,399
it was um hash plant by nl1

1715
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,558
by uh garlic

1716
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,480
yeah but he had a few different versions

1717
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,160
that he made before he released it and i

1718
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,639
think gravity is one of the two

1719
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,879
unreleased versions

1720
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,960
uh yes metal haze is one of the dutch

1721
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,559
flowers ones as well uh that was

1722
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,240
basically a skunk haze and it was

1723
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,319
definitely one of the ones that they got

1724
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,798
people drooling

1725
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,400
over releasing it i grew a bunch of that

1726
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:31,679
one as well but we are going in

1727
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,480
[ __ ] alphabetical order all

1728
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:34,639
right

1729
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,280
i'm [ __ ] it up so whatever

1730
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,719
you got damn pendejos so um

1731
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,519
uh let's see

1732
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:43,279
um cotton candy

1733
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,280
cotton candy did you ever grow a cotton

1734
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,280
candy cup i did grow a cotton candy i

1735
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,599
wish i knew more about it

1736
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,040
um and i actually recently grew a cotton

1737
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,880
candy s1 through my my my buddy who

1738
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,880
lives near me that i've traded back and

1739
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,079
forth with for forever i don't know

1740
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,838
anything about the lineage or the

1741
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,280
backstory of it

1742
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,279
but i did like it

1743
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,519
it was federation seeds cotton candy was

1744
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,200
the one that i was familiar with and

1745
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:08,960
like most stuff from federation there's

1746
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:12,000
um a lot of

1747
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,240
accusations of name renaming whatnot so

1748
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,159
i'm not sure what it really is but i've

1749
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,679
always been a big fan of it you know i

1750
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:19,199
like cotton candy i think that it'll

1751
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:20,558
make a comeback one day just because

1752
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:22,480
it's of its name

1753
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,480
and it's a structure it had a good

1754
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,639
modern look to it

1755
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,679
yeah somebody just threw in uh

1756
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,318
uh

1757
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:32,639
scentsy star genetics um luke from

1758
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:35,119
paradise seeds is scentsy star sensei

1759
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,279
star is an amazing line he refuses to

1760
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,920
talk any lineage or history that i'm

1761
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,559
aware of about specifics

1762
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:45,760
of scentsy star uh matt myself our buddy

1763
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:48,798
pip others have been hunting forever

1764
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,039
for real information uh don't know

1765
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,239
yeah yeah i i've tried recently with

1766
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,160
luke and

1767
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,798
and i highly respect luke like he's one

1768
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:59,358
of the most respected um actual breeders

1769
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:02,159
over in amsterdam by other seed makers

1770
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:04,798
and breeders he's a very serious breeder

1771
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:07,358
but it came from a different era where a

1772
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:08,880
lot of people stole his his genetics but

1773
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,598
he would give out testers people would

1774
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,559
release it before he even released it so

1775
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:18,000
uh yeah i would say a lot of the um

1776
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,559
people like uh simon from serious seeds

1777
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,559
luke uh others they didn't see any

1778
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,319
benefit in giving out lineage that their

1779
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,839
competitors would just steal and claim

1780
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,920
to have the same thing

1781
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:30,000
so neville was extremely open about what

1782
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,599
he used and where he got it and every

1783
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,039
other dutch person after that was

1784
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,720
tight-lipped as [ __ ]

1785
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,079
yeah i would say that's probably

1786
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:37,679
accurate right yeah that's super

1787
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,599
accurate yeah they got they got very

1788
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,239
tight-lipped they saw no benefit to

1789
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,838
revealing what it was made of it was all

1790
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:46,239
their secret sauce they didn't want

1791
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:48,159
anybody stealing the genetics and they

1792
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,038
didn't even want anybody writing similar

1793
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,879
genetics on their own packaging

1794
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,240
yeah so they just kept quiet about it so

1795
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,920
i don't we don't know what scentsy star

1796
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,719
is we don't know what ak is we don't

1797

1798
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,078

um

1800
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,759
cough is something that we have a really

1801
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:12,480
good friend of ours on the discord

1802
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,079
um that is probably more suited to cough

1803
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,358
history than us

1804
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,880

1805
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:20,798
fino

1806
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,720
it came out of connecticut

1807
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:25,358
in the early 90s and it made its way to

1808
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:27,358
colorado most people refer to it as the

1809
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:29,920
fort collins cough

1810
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:32,239

1811
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,200
um it's uh it's an nl fight to me it's

1819
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:54,160
their own sort of story behind them

1820
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:56,239

01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,798
of the story

1825
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,920
but that's the baby

character and he's had it for 20 plus

1833
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,838

1834
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,559
the people involved that brought it to

1835
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:26,558

1836
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,039
it's one of the survive it's i would say

1837
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:32,160
i i've said this before too but nl5

1838
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:35,359
hayes probably has the most surviving

1839
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:37,759
cuts around of any 90s cross

1840
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,119
yeah i wouldn't say so that between

1841
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,880
europe and here

1842
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,920
um and that's one of them

1843
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,039
yep

1844
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,838

1845
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:50,640

grown by monks in central california

1868
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:36,000

1870
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,679
both the super skunk and the chem

1871
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,359
it was his favorite weed that he could

1872
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:43,838
get on dead door

1873
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:47,038
and supposedly there was big sir holy

1874
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:49,119
skunk and big sir holy haze

1875

1876
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,798
dead tour and he swears

1877
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,760
that

1878
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:58,239
big sir holy had such a unique smell

1879
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,160
that you could have somebody walk by and

1880
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:00,879
that was like the fanny pack era you

1881
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:02,558
know

1882
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,838
uh you could have somebody walk by and

1883
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,200
not only could you tell that they had

1884
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,440
good weed you could tell that they had

1885
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,279
the big sir holy yeah

1886
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,280
um and then there's a gut there's some

1887
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,200
guys obviously that

1888
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,359
brought some seeds and some stuff that

1889
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:17,279
have some legend uh to it that brought

1890
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:19,199
it to maybe adam dunn or somebody like

1891
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,200
that and they had that supposedly they

1892
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,879
mixed it into sage

1893
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:25,118
um but that's

1894
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,880
you know it's working didn't make sage

1895
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,798
but so he wouldn't have been told i can

1896
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,039
never pronounce this but it's supposedly

1897
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,519
descended maybe from purple

1898
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:35,359
oh the z pots nejo purple yeah yeah and

1899
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:36,960
and they also refer to it as zacatecas

1900
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:38,798
purple because zacatecas is a z and

1901
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,240
easier to pronounce but yeah it was the

1902
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:44,000
zhua tanejo purple so the

1903
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,239
truck never stopped by my house so i

1904
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,639
just let matt take that one because i

1905
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:50,479
was going to mangle it bad

1906
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:52,318
if i tried to say it but there's a bunch

1907
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,599
of rumors about it it's a legendary

1908
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,440
strain one of my oldest friends uh it

1909
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,280
was his favorite weed on dead tour and

1910
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,159
it was sold on dead tour two different

1911
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,200
types

1912
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,679

1913
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:05,038
yeah yeah i i don't know what's been

1914
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,679
proven about it but it hasn't been

1915
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:10,000
proven about it um i know that that's

1916
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,960

yeah although the original crew that had

1946
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,519
the first headband never called it that

1947

1960
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:43,198
can watch it up there i recently made it

1961
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,199
available um

1962
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:47,358
i did a deep dive on trying to

1963
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:49,519
research provenance based on internet

1964
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,838
research on the day record diesel and i

1965
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,000
got not very far it doesn't go back very

1966
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:56,640
far but the clone's been around a long

1967
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,800
time so it's really hard to find things

1968
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,039
other than like some some tour manager

1969
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,159
from grateful dead kind of gave it out

1970
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:07,679
to some people and that's likely where

1971
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:09,359
that where it begins the story but um it

1972
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:12,158
does appear to be some kind of chem 91

1973
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:15,519
hybrid to me like 1091 early og type

1974
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:17,679
hybrid um super not it's really potent

1975
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,840
it's ripping potent and breeds for that

1976
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,679
potency i love the cut but i just don't

1977
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,800
know if it's the original diesel like it

1978
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,800
claims probably not

1979
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:30,800
what's the next one

1980
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,800
uh we got dog [ __ ] electric boogaloo

1981
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,840
i know so okay so

1982
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,480
uh the dog [ __ ] electric boogaloo was it

1983
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,279
it came out of minneapolis area

1984
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:44,718
minnesota in the very early 90s

1985
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:46,479
it's supposed to be a nl5 haze

1986
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,800
i wouldn't say that's a hundred percent

1987
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:51,039
guaranteed it's conjecture a little bit

1988
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,640
but boy does it really

1989
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:57,279
i think it is uh it made its way to uh

1990
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:01,840
oregon and got renamed dog [ __ ]

1991
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:03,679
which is a shame um because it was uh

1992
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,520
i think electric boogaloo is one of the

1993
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,640
coolest

1994
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,800
weed names

1995
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,079
yeah it is um

1996
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,600
i grow it

1997
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,158
i like it a bunch

1998
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:17,120
it's uh um

1999
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:18,639
you know it's a 12 or 13 week

2000
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:20,158
uh sativa

2001
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,159
very up high

2002
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:24,639
uh and it kind of looks like to me like

2003
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:26,879
classic 90s

2004
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,440
northern lights uh it kind of smells

2005
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,679
like classic 90s sweet to me yeah it's

2006
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:33,919
it's it's one of the pretty if it is

2007
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:37,440
pure nl5 haze it's one of the prettier

2008
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,239
ones as far as like visually attractive

2009
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:42,158
um i've had it for a while i love it

2010
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,079
yeah it's a great cut

2011
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:46,158
great buzz highly recommend it highly

2012
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,640
recommend the hybrids that come from it

2013
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:50,879
if you can get it or get hybrids of it

2014
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,800
uh i enjoy it quite a bit

2015
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,719
so this is one that's totally i have no

2016
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,920
experience with at all but you might

2017
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,359
dumpster

2018
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,199
dumpster

2019
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,399
uh dumpster

2020
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:02,559
is

2021
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:05,599
uh

2022
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,840
supposedly the story of dumpster is that

2023
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,920
a guy got

2024
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,360
busted right and the cops in the 90s

2025
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,319
were throwing

2026
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:15,920
all of his equipment and his weed out

2027
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:17,599
in a dumpster

2028
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,440
and while they were upstairs [ __ ]

2029
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,360
with it some people walked by and saw

2030
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:23,039
weed plants

2031
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,039
sticking out of the dumpster and grabbed

2032
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,760
one and ran off with it

2033
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,800
and

2034
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,719
they named it dumpster yeah

2035
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,960
likely story

2036
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,119
i mean it might be real who knows that's

2037
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,679
the story behind it whether or not that

2038
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:38,800
story is true or whether it's a tail or

2039
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,560
whatever

2040
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,119
um that doesn't give you a lot of

2041
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,440
information about its lineage yeah

2042
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:48,479
obviously but you know

2043
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:50,238
um g13 we did just a few weeks ago with

2044
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:52,319
archive we just uploaded it we went into

2045
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:54,238
more detail on it so we can skip over

2046
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,479
that one for now um

2047
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,319
the golden [ __ ] goat

2048
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:01,279
i'll let you talk about the golden goat

2049
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:04,559
yeah um it was made by

2050
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:08,079
uh jeff mr dink from colorado if i'm

2051
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,000
correct there was a sister cut i believe

2052
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,760
there uh i can't remember its name the

2053
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,479
funky [ __ ] or something

2054
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,560
like that um i think it was a

2055
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,639
iss romulan

2056
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,560
island sweet skunk an island sweet skunk

2057
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,719
was a rename of something else from

2058
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:26,480
somewhere else island sweet skunk is

2059
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:28,239
supposedly an nl5 hey spino

2060
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,158
really yeah 100

2061
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:32,079
um i know multiple canadians that have

2062
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:35,920
told me that

2063
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:36,880
and uh supposedly it got renamed by mark

2064
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,920
emery

2065
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:42,560
yeah who wanted skunk seeds

2066
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,880
to sell in his catalog um but it is

2067
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,400
supposedly an nl5

2068
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,359
haze fino

2069
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:49,039
um

2070
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:51,599
you know and it was crossed to something

2071
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,519
from uh

2072
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,480
the one that got sold from mark emery

2073
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,679
was crossed to something um that breeder

2074
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,519
steve had

2075
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,119
i can't remember i could get the story

2076
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,480
it's not popping up in my head right on

2077
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:04,238
the top of my head but that's that's

2078
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,718
what it is yeah and they're right

2079
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:08,718
actually uh mr dink was from kansas that

2080
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,880
is correct i don't know why i said

2081
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,239
caller it got real popular in colorado i

2082
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,480
think maybe he moved there i might be

2083
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,559
wrong on that but it got super popular

2084
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:18,799
at colorado for a long time and yeah

2085
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,320
island sweet scone hybrid of steve's uh

2086
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,880
sweet skunk and that's why he flipped

2087
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:25,679
out about it um sweet skunk widow there

2088
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,199
we go sweet skunk widow iss

2089
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,560
um

2090
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:30,399
yeah i don't i mean that's what steve

2091
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,159
says it is and the federation supposedly

2092
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,198
changed the name in his story

2093
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:34,879
um

2094
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,279
but yeah it was i thought golden goat

2095
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,199
was very frosty it was a nice like uh

2096
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:40,639
narrow leaf dominant plant i liked it a

2097
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:42,079
lot um

2098
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,840
but yeah it was it was one of those ones

2099
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:45,359
that got overblown in colorado so a lot

2100
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,960
of people just kind of [ __ ] talked it

2101
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,839
after a time but i thought it was pretty

2102
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:53,198
good i thought it was decent um

2103
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,199
the granddaddy purple

2104
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,960
so

2105
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,960
granddaddy purple came about um in the

2106
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,359
purple craze era

2107
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,480
i would say that the probably the first

2108
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,519
two

2109
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:11,839
purple cuts that got famous right then

2110
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:15,199
uh was my mendo perps and the urkel

2111
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:18,000
um and then right around that same time

2112
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:20,319
lavender came up there's a debate

2113
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,158
uh between whether or not lavender was

2114
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:24,079
massively different than urkel or was

2115
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:25,839
just a different little pheno

2116
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:28,559
um my buddy that i was just talking

2117
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,880
about uh that lives over in lake county

2118
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,840
i remember 20 22 years ago something

2119
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,480
like that

2120
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,159
um he had brought down the lavender

2121
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:39,919
from uh

2122
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:41,839

so

2172
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,880
someone in their 20s and 30s growing um

2173
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:28,960
supposedly there was this old vietnam

2174
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,480
vet that brought back some some seeds

2175
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,960
from vietnam

2176
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:35,359
and uh grew a bunch of hate and grew a

2177
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,359
bunch of sativas and started mixing them

2178
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,880
with local afghans and sort of had his

2179
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:39,920
own which was really common at the time

2180
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,760
his own

2181
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,800
his own hill wheat

2182
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,480
right

2183
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,239
and then um he was retiring uh because

2184
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,158
he'd done really well and he gave he

2185
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:52,079
gave her a few hundred seeds of his hilt

2186
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,439
hill weed right

2187
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:55,119
and um

2188
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:57,759
she said that she found what what got

2189
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:58,399
called the gdp in the first 50 seats

2190
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,360
yeah

2191
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,839
right

2192
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:04,238
uh later on she partnered i helped her

2193
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,880
build it actually she partnered on a 66

2194
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:08,399
lighter with uh ken estes

2195
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,039
yeah right i can say his full name

2196
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:12,960
because he's he's well known yeah um and

2197
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,279
she gave the cut to him

2198
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,880
yeah she's a super anarchist had no

2199
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:17,840
interest in being public or anything

2200
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,679
like that

2201
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,960
ken took it down to the bay and added

2202
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,119
his name to it

2203
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,880
of course he's one of the first people i

2204
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:29,119
know of that added his name to a cut yep

2205
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,640
you know later on other people started

2206
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,158
doing that taking cuts that weren't

2207
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,760
theirs and throwing their name on it as

2208
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:35,920
part of claiming it

2209
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,640
yeah um and he's given some mangled

2210
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,039
versions of that story i just told

2211
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,960
yeah because he didn't actually have any

2212
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:44,238
part to do with the origin story he got

2213
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,719
it from my friend

2214
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:48,959
yeah and um the interview that i post

2215
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:51,279
all the time of ken telling his origin

2216
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:54,079
stories at first he says it was a

2217
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:56,319
a skunk from a vietnam vet that quickly

2218
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:59,119
turns into a native american gifted it

2219
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:01,279
to him in front of a uh some headlights

2220
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:02,319
because he was such a wonderful white

2221
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,439
man

2222
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:05,759
so yeah

2223
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:09,919
so he turned it into a seed line that he

2224
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:11,840
helpfully called ken's gdp yep um and

2225
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,158
all that and so

2226
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,440
um but my version of it and i knew them

2227
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:17,839
at the time

2228
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:19,839
was that she gave it to him

2229
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,520
yeah and that you know this is back in

2230
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,119
the early 2000s or whatever when

2231
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,800
everyone wanted to stay invisible

2232
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:27,359
especially if you were running 60 70

2233
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,920
lights and off a generator in the woods

2234
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:31,839
sure and he decided to go down and flow

2235
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,359
it into the bay and flow it into third

2236
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,520
floor and flow it into various

2237
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:36,880
dispensaries and made a name for himself

2238
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,480
yeah

2239
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,359
so you can choose what you want to

2240
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:40,718
believe

2241
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:42,479
yeah about all that

2242
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:46,158
okay here's here's another one that ties

2243
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:46,158
straight into it and that's great babe

2244
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:53,360
kyle cushman's is it it was he the

2245
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,678
inventor was it brett bogue from um

2246
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:58,079
apothecary was he the inventor of the

2247
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,079
grape vape who is who is the creator of

2248
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:02,079
great bait

2249
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:02,960
this might also get me in trouble

2250
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:06,000
um

2251
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,800
but uh so i'll say this okay and i'll

2252
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,198
just let people decide yeah um

2253
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,840
yeah as everyone is well aware

2254
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:15,839
uh you know when things become famous

2255
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,800
quickly one or two famous cuts start

2256
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,840
getting renamed or hybrids or bag seeds

2257
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:24,000
start getting named because there's this

2258
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,440
there's this you know um big push to

2259
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,039
have your own [ __ ]

2260
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:29,279
yeah it happened with kush it happened

2261
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,960
with cookie it happened with the purple

2262
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,960
crates right

2263
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,639
so at first there was just mendo perps

2264
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,840
and hercle then all of a sudden there

2265
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:41,119
was mendo perps urkel grape ape gdp

2266
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:43,199
platinum purple purple dragon

2267
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,079
on and on and on and on right

2268
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,000
so

2269
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,920
uh some people think that great grape

2270
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
ape came out of willets some people

2271
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,520
think that grape ape um

2272
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,960
was just a rename

2273
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,520
okay

2274
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,439
um but there's a gentleman uh you can

2275
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,080
find him on the internet his name's

2276
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:01,279

2278
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,039
and he claims that he flew it down from

2279
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:07,039

and brought the grape ape to mendo

2282
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:14,000
so he claims that

2283
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,560
um kyle cushman had nothing to do with

2284
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,520
it other than kyle cushman moved to

2285
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,000

01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,639
from him

2290
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:27,840
very very very good but kyle had

2291
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,359
absolutely nothing to do with it

2292
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,960
whatsoever if you want to give anybody

2293

a bag seat of such or homie actually did

2297
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:38,880
that

2298
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,960

you know with a lot of these outlaw

2300
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,639
stories and stuff it's kind of who you

2301
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,239
choose to believe i i remember there was

2302
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:48,560
also the story that it was urkel shiva

2303
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:50,718
scott as well and just that just what

2304
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,719
went around with it i mean me and modi

2305
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:55,039
both referred to it as purple's pretty

2306
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,920
sister it showed up

2307
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:59,359
after the purple craze was i mean i'll

2308
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,359
explain the purple craze for a minute

2309
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:03,679
when i mean the purple craze i mean that

2310
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:06,319
there was brokers coming up from the bay

2311
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,359
to mendo and saying we will buy every

2312
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:08,799
gram

2313
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:10,880
of this purple weave that you can get

2314
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,719
your hands on yeah you have 50 of them

2315
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,440
you have 80 of them you have 150 of them

2316
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,359
you have 250 of them i'll cash you out

2317
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,198
and so what happens to growers when they

2318
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:20,960
start hearing brokers want to cash you

2319
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,879
out on however much you have

2320
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,119
yeah and so your neighbor is like dude

2321
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,039
i'm having some trouble moving my weed

2322
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,399
it's not going as fast as i want and the

2323
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:30,479
neighbor's like well i'll give you this

2324
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,399
cut and you just give it all to me

2325
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:33,279
yeah and i'll move everything you got of

2326
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:34,158
it

2327
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:35,920
yeah

2328
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:38,238
right so

2329
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,279
you know and then after a craze happens

2330
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:41,599
like that

2331
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:43,198
um all these different names pop up

2332
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,800
right

2333
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:46,638
so you know it went from one or two

2334
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,079
purple strains to eight or ten of them

2335
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,000
within a year or two

2336
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,719
yeah and it probably would have lasted

2337
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,279
longer but sort of the kush the cush

2338
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:57,920
craze and the sour diesel thing happened

2339
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:59,039
and sort of push the purples to the side

2340
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,880
yeah

2341
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:02,319
you know

2342
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,359
so that's right

2343
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:07,679
green crack also known as green cush

2344
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:09,119
with the c

2345
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:12,239
um

2346
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,519
i you know i i don't have a verifiable

2347
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,759
story

2348
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,360
behind it you know i know people claim

2349
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,560
various things you might know more about

2350
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:21,279
it than i do that you might want to

2351
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:24,480
speak on it to me it's some kind of

2352
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:25,840
skunk one yeah it grows like a skunk i

2353
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,919
don't know that it's pure skunk or

2354
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,480
anything like that but boy

2355
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:33,679
it grows and a lot of i think a lot of

2356
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:34,399
like uh dna's lemon skunk and all that

2357
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:37,039
[ __ ]

2358
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:38,638
is just a prettier name

2359
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:41,359
for green crack

2360
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:43,359
oh interesting yeah um

2361
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:45,039
um it was called green kush when it

2362
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:48,079
entered our circle and i got it through

2363
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,679
the hogs family circle um so it was

2364
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:52,800
originally whenever it was on the tags

2365
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,399
it was always cush kush and no cecil did

2366
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,639
not make green crack or have anything to

2367
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:58,000
do with it how cecil's name entered it

2368
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,159
and me and cecil went over this

2369
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,840
specifically because i was one of the

2370
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,759
first people to bring green crack into

2371
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,840
seed form to the community and stuff so

2372
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,280
i wanted to hunt down the history on it

2373
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,480
and i had heard the same thing with

2374
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:12,319
cecil his crew had a seedline called

2375
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,599
kush c-u-s-h

2376
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:15,920
and

2377
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:19,120
that's as far as the connection went it

2378
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:21,199
was that they both had renamed cushes

2379
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,198
and and they were both spelled c but

2380
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,719
that's as far as the connection went um

2381
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:27,198
yeah i think it's probably a skunk one

2382
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,119
type because it's super mango um with a

2383
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:30,960
little bit of cold it would turn mega

2384
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:32,800
mega purple it also bred true for that

2385
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,639
purple trait and it would show up

2386
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,520
genetically as opposed to just with cold

2387
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,800
and its hybrids um i think i i want to

2388
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,880
see it come back that it's one of those

2389
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,279
clones that was everywhere and now is

2390
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,840
nowhere all at

2391
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:44,960
i'll say once

2392
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,400
same thing

2393
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,760
i'll say the same thing about i said

2394
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:49,920
about blue dream

2395
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,840
you grow a four to six or seven ounce

2396
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,800
plant of green crack

2397
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,880
it's really nice weed yeah you grow a

2398
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,480
five or eight pound plant in the outdoor

2399
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,840
and beat the [ __ ] out of it and don't

2400
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:01,678
dry it the right way

2401
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,840
yeah but you grow a little moderate

2402
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,319
sized plant of it it's got really nice

2403
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,319
lemony terps it's got a unique kind of

2404
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:11,359
aroma to it it gets it has a nice

2405
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:12,479
uplifting buzz it's very pretty it burns

2406
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:14,319
well

2407
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:17,119
um and someone mentioned it i do think

2408
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:18,559
dna's lemon skunk is just a renamed

2409
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:20,880
green crack

2410
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,080
that they prettied up to breed with

2411
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,920
probably i mean they were known for

2412
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:25,359
doing that i mean when they started

2413
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,880
their company no offense to them or

2414
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:28,719
anything they just went around mendo and

2415
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,279
humboldt various places and gathered up

2416
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,840
as many good clone onlys as they could

2417
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,599
yeah well they started their company as

2418
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,920
soma's little little

2419
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:40,000
little buddies and he gave them a c99

2420
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,840
that they renamed to uh some sort of

2421
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,520
haze cantaloupe pays they i believe they

2422
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,800
called it that yeah so that's they

2423
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,320
started their company off of uh c99 and

2424
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,719
renamed it and when you start your

2425
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:53,279
company that way it it

2426
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:54,639
there's no reason to start doing it the

2427
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:56,719
right way

2428
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,079
that's why i look at it

2429
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,679
the seed business has never been

2430
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,840
particularly honorable

2431
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:05,440
no yeah um we got hogg's breath

2432
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,600
that's you bro

2433
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:10,158
yeah that was that was true

2434
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,239
san diego crew it was made by jimbo

2435
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:13,119
james hogg rest in peace

2436
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:15,039
um

2437
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:17,599
he said several different things that it

2438
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:20,719
possibly could have been made um his big

2439
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,400
one was a williams wonder hybrid um i

2440
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,079
think personally it was probably a skunk

2441
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,679
one some type of afghani williams what

2442
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:29,600
it would fit or lights would fit of some

2443
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:32,399
sort um it could be foot funky cheese it

2444
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:36,480
had a lot of the similar thialic smells

2445
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,719
of like a chem d or a um a cheese and

2446
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,959
i've seen sweet hogs

2447
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:43,520
it's it's it has very specific type

2448
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,920

2485
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:10,319
of the old sauer crew

2486

um has come out

2487
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:12,840
and said

2488
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,239
that uh

2489
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:18,480
um that you know the the they had these

2490
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:20,000
cuts diesel 1 and diesel 2 which were

2491
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:22,158
bag seed

2492
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,719
of some chem they were getting

2493
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:26,879
and um they grew them out and there was

2494
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,719
a buddy of theirs in new york that

2495
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:31,199
thought that the diesel 2

2496
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:33,198
um made there made it feel like there

2497
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:35,599
was a band around his head after he

2498
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:39,119
smoked it and so they nicknamed it the

2499
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,000
headband and it so happens that

2500
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:41,519
um

2501
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,238
that diesel 2

2502
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,360
there's it so happens that that cut

2503
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:46,799

2504
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:48,158
um

2505
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,079
that cut is the

2506
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:51,519
the seeds coming out of that cut is

2507
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:53,760
where the first

2508
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,719
um is where the first sour diesel came

2509
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:58,480
from

2510
01:28:54,719 --> 01:29:01,039

headband that i have that i call the la

2512
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:06,319
um 707 is a child of that made by

2513
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,159
mandelbrot yeah he crossed that to

2514
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,158
something that i'm not sure of

2515
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:13,119
um and then you know you get things like

2516
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:15,519
people were you know there's people that

2517

um and who knows if that's

2518
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:20,080
there's there's there's people that um

2519
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:21,679
that think that have tried to say that

2520
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:23,119
the one that matt uses what i call the

2521
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,039
56

2522
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,119
um is the original new york city

2523
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:29,039
headband and people advertise it at that

2524
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:30,719
duke had it they were bit there him and

2525
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:32,238
his crew were big on saying it was the

2526
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,719
first headband

2527
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:36,638
um loompa was big on saying that his

2528
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:39,039
headband was the only real headband and

2529
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:41,600
everything else was a pale imitation

2530
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:43,439
um and then the sour people come out and

2531
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,239
start talking about it and it turns out

2532
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:46,559
that

2533
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:48,238
you know um the headband they're

2534
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,920
speaking of that was the first one was

2535
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:51,519
not cush-like at all

2536
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,719
yeah

2537
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,480
so it's one of those ones that um

2538
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,480
there was a lot of stories based on it

2539
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,079
because there was a bunch of mystery

2540
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:02,238
uh and there's also a thing about that

2541
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:03,359
56 day i call it the 56th day just

2542
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:05,039
because that's

2543
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:07,759
it's like the least offensive nickname

2544
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:09,600
of it but um that came out of the cush

2545
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,719
crew in southern california and it came

2546
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,400
up to the bay

2547
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,960
and they renamed it

2548
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:17,439
yeah intentionally

2549
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,039
lumpa's story is a bit shady

2550
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:21,119
um

2551
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:23,600
he got to say the least and he got it

2552
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:24,800
and he got it and he decided to add his

2553
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,600
name to it

2554
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,440
yes and ever since he's been extremely

2555
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,440
touchy

2556
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:33,279
about uh that headband has to be the

2557
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,799
best headband and everybody else is just

2558
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,599
a [ __ ] for trying to have as good of a

2559
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,239
headband as loomba headband yeah um so

2560
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:42,560
it's really a muddled history you know

2561
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:44,638
every time we talk about it it stirs up

2562
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:47,840
so much [ __ ] you guys have no [ __ ]

2563
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:50,000
clue so there's the 707 headband which

2564
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,319
is a mandelbrot seed creation that he

2565
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,840
used off the the mother cut that i still

2566
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:55,599
have the l.a

2567
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,800
yeah there's a couple what i consider to

2568
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,320
be og kush type phenos which is the 56

2569
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,840
and the lumpa

2570
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:05,759
um the old-school guys uh that first had

2571
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,039
the diesel 2 and the headband they think

2572
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,119
it's dead

2573
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:11,039
yeah and they're suspect that it could

2574
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:13,439
exist on the west coast

2575
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:16,719
so like a lot of things there's mystery

2576
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:19,599
yeah let's put it that way

2577
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,439
there was one major claim that um duke

2578
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,960
had bought it from chemdawg but i

2579
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:25,119
specifically asked him dog about it and

2580
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:27,119
he said he's never grown headband so

2581
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,880
that that's a problem

2582
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:32,479
i mean i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure

2583
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:34,560
that when uh you know when uh duke and

2584
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:37,119
homie tried to work for your buddy matt

2585
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,360
and matt elite yeah that he got it in

2586
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:41,599
that little era when he was in colorado

2587
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,399
yeah and had no previous experience with

2588
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:47,760
it that cut that that he uses

2589
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:50,238
is a super super nice very potent cut

2590
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,800
sure yeah it's just it's just a cush cut

2591
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:54,959
it's not diesel yeah it's not the

2592
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,560
original head definitely definitely and

2593
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,439
they and um

2594
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,760
you know and uh yeah and lumpa's

2595
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:04,158
headband is is a is a cut that he got

2596
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,639
under suspicious circumstances

2597
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:08,638
and uh renamed it

2598
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:11,920
yep after himself

2599
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:14,719
yep and uh mateo yeah uh hemphill worked

2600
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:16,800
with the elite crew dave yeah so that

2601
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:21,359
will do exactly what i'm talking about

2602
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:23,119
uh uh icy collective probably skunk va

2603

they all have that that

2604
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:27,760
that cut kind of got pushed around the

2605
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,880
bay a bit i think i got it no six maybe

2606

um but yeah i mean i it

2609
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:38,158

from the original killer queen but the

2681
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:19,039

2693
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,679
level where uh

2694
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:47,520
you know i i view most citrus as sort of

2695
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,880
two one note for me

2696
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,520
yeah you know

2697
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:54,880
but it was a big yielding kind of ugly

2698
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:56,560
long running cola's plant

2699
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,480
and it's kind of one of those weeds that

2700
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,440
people love for two or three days and

2701
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,959

2705
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:12,559
g hybrid like it's so it's super obvious

2706
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:15,199
to me um it's not the prettiest bud not

2707
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:18,400
at all no it's kind of i would consider

2708
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:21,678
it a post cookie era i would consider it

2709
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:24,079
ugly it would yeah it's very ugly um

2710
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:26,399

about a lot of their various different

2725
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,760
subjects

2726
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:02,480

2727
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,960
asked him about uh that and the basic

2728
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:07,678
five and if he got any seed stock from

2729
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,679
neville and sort of just called it by

2730
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:12,480
different names at the time

2731
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:14,079
uh he laughed and smiled and didn't say

2732
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:16,000
a whole lot

2733
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:18,319
you know so we didn't really get any

2734
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,960
specifics from it

2735
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:24,639
but there's no indication that he got

2736
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:26,800
um that he got you know any private uh

2737
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:28,319
nl stock from anyone

2738
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,520

2740
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,080

2741
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:35,359

2742
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:36,238
massachusetts super skunk

2743
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:38,719
boy

2744

so this one has been described in other

2745
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,158
podcasts and stuff quite a bit

2746
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:44,238
yeah

2747
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:46,799
it's got an enormous amount of confusion

2748
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:49,839
about it it's a attained legendary

2749
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,000
status uh especially because some of the

2750
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,960
people that are involved in it are very

2751
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,399
famous

2752

uh and

2754
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:03,920
especially since that rank uh roadkill

2755
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:06,319
skunk uh seems to be the scam of the

2756
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,480
minute uh where for the last five or six

2757

2760
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,239

2761
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:15,840

2763
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:20,000
because the guy that went and got it

2764
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,000

i believe it's in sour diesel

2773
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:45,198
you know it's not really from

2774
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:47,439
massachusetts it got dropped off there

2775
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:48,719
uh by my buddy when he got the chem dog

2776
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:51,039
from dude

2777
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,639
um and what's interesting about it is

2778
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:55,439
that the cut

2779
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:57,039
when uh when skunk va went east and got

2780
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:59,759
the chem d and brought it back when we

2781
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:01,439
gave when greg got the dog back

2782
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,079
um

2783
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:06,238
by that point uh according to according

2784
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:07,118
to uh to our buddy he had already lost

2785
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,399
it

2786
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:12,479
and the the uh massachusetts super skunk

2787
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:14,799
that they posted in the

2788
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,879
um in the uh

2789
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,960
high times was a lot shorter was a lot

2790
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,639
squatter was a lot and that's the one i

2791
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,239
believe is the mom of diesel because

2792
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,679
diesel is a spitting image of that one

2793
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:26,079
and i was going to bring that up in the

2794
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:27,118
sense that it's more than likely bag

2795
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:29,198
seed

2796
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:32,079
but it's one of those ones where nobody

2797
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:34,238
really wants to claim the truth on it

2798
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:36,319
yeah a lot of people keep popping up

2799
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:37,759
swearing that they have it

2800
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:39,840
um

2801
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,760
a lot of ms it's one of those ones where

2802
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,679
it's like there's a massive demand for

2803
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,560
it

2804
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,480
but

2805
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,639
i've never seen anyone that i grew it

2806
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:51,519
from probably not 90 i don't know late

2807
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:53,199
90s to 08ish or something

2808
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,840
yeah and

2809
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:57,118
i've never seen a jar of it

2810
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,880
yet

2811
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:00,719
you know everyone that claims that they

2812
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,118
have rank skunk and it's gonna pop in

2813
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,399
their seeds i've never seen a jar

2814
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:07,039
i've never you know and you would think

2815
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:09,519
that it's so popular and people so want

2816
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:11,118
those skunk terps that all these various

2817
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,480
breeders and stuff that claim that

2818
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:14,158
they're gonna you're gonna find a bunch

2819
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:15,439
of skunk in their work

2820
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:17,679
um

2821
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:19,759
you know it's uh it's one of those

2822
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,158
legendary cuts now

2823
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,239
yeah most people got rid of it because

2824
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:25,599
it smelled like crazy

2825
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:28,158
and uh

2826
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:30,639
you know and and all that and like the

2827
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:32,638
the massachusetts super skunk i will say

2828
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:35,279
uh this isn't super well known but it is

2829
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:38,000
not pure super skunk either

2830
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:41,920
it was bred through various skunky

2831
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,319
things that ssc sssc had and neville had

2832
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:47,679
and then when neville released the super

2833
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:50,158
skunk they crossed that um

2834
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:52,000
that line that they already had to the

2835
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:54,000
super skunk

2836
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,359
and phenos of that are what became

2837
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
famous

2838
01:40:55,359 --> 01:41:00,479
yes that's the latest um

2839
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,560
the information that we got if one of

2840
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,399
our members of our crew got directly

2841
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,000
from the guy who

2842
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:08,079
pot or bread

2843
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,158
right the mass super and there's an

2844
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,359
aspect where you know there's like like

2845
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:12,479
we were just talking about with the

2846
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:14,158
headbands

2847
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,399
mystery history

2848
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:18,238
allows various people to make wild

2849
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:19,439
claims thinking that it won't ever get

2850
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:21,759
popped up

2851
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,960
um it came out to california with my

2852
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,520
friend when the same time you brought

2853
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:27,760
the chem dog out and it survived amongst

2854
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:30,800
our crew and he grew it for some time

2855
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:33,039
um it went to colorado through that that

2856
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:36,320
breeder's other friends and it got

2857
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:38,719
called skunk six out there uh after the

2858
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:41,279
the the number of the fien the number of

2859
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:43,359
the fino you know that they were growing

2860
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:46,238
and it's got a lot of legend to it you

2861
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:47,839
know it's probably in it's in my opinion

2862
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:50,000
it's probably in chem d it's probably

2863
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,960
it's def i think it's in sour

2864
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,639
um and a lot of people want it and it

2865
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,880
seems to not exist

2866
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:58,960
uh you know maybe it exists in various

2867
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:02,239
forms we'll see maybe it pops up one day

2868
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:05,118
but um more people have been excited

2869
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:07,359
about selling the name

2870
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,799
than making sure they have it

2871
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:10,479
in my opinion

2872
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,000
people have been excited about selling

2873
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:12,879
the name

2874
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,800
so

2875
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,800
i will say one other thing

2876
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,719
um that uh

2877
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,039
you know uh neville always said that his

2878
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:24,560
two best-selling things were super skunk

2879
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:26,399
and uh and nl5 hates yes so there's

2880
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,800
probably a lot of super skunk out there

2881
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:32,960
blended into various things i think that

2882
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,800
i personally think that super skunk is

2883
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,880
a lot of what people refer to as skunky

2884
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:39,279
dank um that went around in their area

2885
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,600
was probably if you know super skunk i'm

2886
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:44,479
damn near convinced of this after seeing

2887
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:46,239
stuff like the old p91 um my heirloom

2888
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,000
afghani line just an old afghani line

2889
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:50,399
that happened to be from florida it's

2890
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,399
very super skunk like um the clock

2891
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:53,839
worked cut um

2892
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:56,719
all kinds of [ __ ] around me was super

2893
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,239
skunky i

2894
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,840
how the hell could it have disappeared

2895
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:02,319
and it's really simple

2896
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,000
um most skunk you know people think

2897
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:06,238
about this crazy terp and i will say

2898
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,198
that it had the turp in spades

2899
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:11,439
right it was incredibly stinky

2900
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:13,359
it was only moderate potency it was only

2901
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:15,439
moderate density you could have this big

2902
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:16,559
ass bud and you'd put it on the scale

2903
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:18,319
and you'd be like oh that's going to be

2904
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,760
six or seven grams and it'd be like two

2905
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:22,880
and a half

2906
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,679
you know and it was pre-carbon filters

2907
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,440
um so it got a lot of people in trouble

2908
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:29,520
i mean i remember driving up to my house

2909
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:32,319
a bunch in summer and like parking in my

2910
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:35,199
driveway and i could just smell it

2911
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:37,118
and you know it was you know like i said

2912
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:38,638
earlier in the show other things get

2913
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:41,198
more popular

2914
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:43,039
and people drop [ __ ] and then they think

2915
01:43:41,198 --> 01:43:44,960
oh i can always get it back someone else

2916
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:46,960
is holding it someone else is holding it

2917
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,079
and now it's like

2918
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,039
you know

2919
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:53,679
people can't find it you know so

2920
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:55,359
but uh it exists in a lot of children i

2921
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:57,199
definitely think it's in sour diesel i

2922
01:43:55,359 --> 01:44:00,079
can smell it and sour i can even see it

2923
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:02,479
in sourdough yeah there you go

2924
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:04,880
i would agree 100

2925
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:08,718
uh this one's from my buddy sub rob

2926
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:10,480
um the matanuska valley [ __ ]

2927
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,880
i have a cool story about that yeah

2928
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:14,718
let's hear it so it sounds to me like

2929
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:17,679
the matt nuscha valley [ __ ] ends

2930
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:19,279
up being kind of like crippy or diesel

2931
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:23,118
or something like that in terms of it

2932
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:24,800
was like a name for fireweed yes right

2933
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:26,639
and uh

2934
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:29,199
when i was on dead tour there was a

2935
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:31,840
buddy of ours that was from alaska uh

2936
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:35,118
and was on tour and he would go home to

2937
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,880
alaska in between tours yeah and i gave

2938
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:39,039
him one time i gave him like twelve

2939
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:41,679
hundred dollars for a quarter pound

2940
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:44,238
yeah and then he didn't give me any weed

2941
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,679
for months and i thought he jacked me

2942
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:46,839
and then he called me up and he said hey

2943
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:49,520
i'm gonna send you

2944
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,239
something and he sent me this weed

2945
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,199
and

2946
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:55,198
it showed up in the mail and it was wet

2947
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:56,719
yeah and i took it out and i dried it

2948
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:58,559
and it was only like three and a half

2949
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,639
ounces so i lost like a half ounce of

2950
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,880
weight and it was three and a half four

2951
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:05,600
months late uh but he said it was

2952
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,520
thunder [ __ ] and it was olive dark green

2953
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,400
with these weird hairs and it was so

2954
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,239
good

2955
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:12,960
my buddies and i kept it in the freezer

2956
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:14,399
and we smoked it uh only for special

2957
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,439
occasions over the next six or eight

2958
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:17,920
months

2959
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:19,678
yeah great high great buzz

2960
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:21,679
much better weed than anything we had at

2961
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:24,079
the time as far as kind bud granted this

2962
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:25,199
is when i was 17 18 19 so take that into

2963
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:27,359
account

2964
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:28,960
uh and everyone that's claimed matanuska

2965
01:45:27,359 --> 01:45:31,198
[ __ ] since then none of it is

2966
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,800
looked like it yeah none of it looked

2967
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:33,678
like the weed that i got back then one

2968
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,079
time

2969
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:38,000
so yeah there you go i think that's like

2970
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:41,439
everyone's story that i've met there's a

2971
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,760
lot of people from alaska that

2972
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:45,599
i think are very convinced that you know

2973
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,760
the matt muska [ __ ] that they had

2974
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,920
was the original and the only and they

2975
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:52,079
can tell you all about it you know who

2976
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,440
grew it who made it etc etc but there's

2977
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:55,198
a lot of stories like that and i think

2978
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:56,879
that it i think they're probably all

2979
01:45:55,198 --> 01:46:00,079
telling their own truth i know what i

2980
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:02,000
mean i will say too that uh the the

2981
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:04,639
package that i got mailed was mailed

2982
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,399
from denali alaska post office

2983
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:08,960
yeah which was pretty funny

2984
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:10,960
yeah that is funny yeah

2985
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,480
now yeah yeah so

2986
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,560
uh but i thought i got ripped off for

2987
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,959
months because i gave him 1200 bucks

2988
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:18,800
and i didn't see any weed for months

2989
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,399
and he kept his he kept the funny thing

2990
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,360
about that this is a little bit of a

2991
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:26,399
side tangent but he kept his he was a

2992
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:29,359
native to alaska and he kept his um

2993
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:33,519
license and all that from alaska because

2994
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:34,960
alas native alaskans got um oil money

2995
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,560
yeah every year

2996
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,880
so even though he was on dead tour and

2997
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,679
he was like in the lower 48 most of the

2998
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,118
year

2999
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:43,440
he would keep all of his [ __ ] at his

3000
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:45,039
parents house and just go back there in

3001
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:46,719
between and he would get like between a

3002
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:49,198
two and a five thousand dollar check

3003
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:51,439
every year yeah isn't that [ __ ] wild

3004
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,279
one of my friends uh in high school got

3005
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:54,719
shipped out to alaska

3006
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:55,759
we were a bunch of punk rock kids and he

3007
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,279
got in trouble he got in a lot of

3008
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,600
trouble one day doing some punk rock

3009
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:01,118
things and i got shipped out to alaska

3010
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,199
for a few years and he came back and he

3011
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:05,279
was the first person to like talk to me

3012
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:07,359
about some strain that was like he's

3013
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:10,719
like bro

3014
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:12,319
thc numbers ever it's called the magnus

3015
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:14,880
valley [ __ ] you know and he had

3016
01:47:12,319 --> 01:47:16,880
this big tale of of uh

3017
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,880
you know this very special potent weed

3018
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,400
that was out there in alaska you know

3019
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,960
and i was always trying to figure out

3020
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,879
more about this thing and as i as i kept

3021
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,800
digging deeper and deeper like i learned

3022
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:29,118
that there were several people with

3023
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:31,199
several claims to several

3024
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:34,399
thunder [ __ ] out there the more you dig

3025
01:47:31,198 --> 01:47:36,638
into it the wider the story becomes

3026
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:39,279
yeah let's put it that way lots of

3027
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:40,800
bikers involved in most of them

3028
01:47:39,279 --> 01:47:42,880
let's put it that way so it's hard to

3029
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:45,279
say if it was a one thing or it was just

3030
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,600
a regional name like maui wowie like

3031
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:50,399
crippy even my buddies everyone thinks

3032
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:52,320
about diesel as sour diesel now but you

3033
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,158
know in the mid 90s or whatever the only

3034
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:56,639
reason why i got called sour diesel was

3035
01:47:54,158 --> 01:47:59,439
because the guy wrote our diesel

3036
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:02,159
yeah because diesel was slang for fire

3037
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:03,759
weed in new york city in that time

3038
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:05,759
yeah my friends that lived there said

3039
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:07,119
that you got all kinds of diesels

3040
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,960
because that was that was the name and i

3041
01:48:07,118 --> 01:48:10,238
think [ __ ] is a bit like that but

3042
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:13,039
there you go

3043
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:16,079
yeah have you have you ever heard of

3044
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:18,960
sour diesel being called the [ __ ] diesel

3045
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:21,118
have you ever heard that no okay and

3046
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:24,399
i've talked i've talked

3047
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:27,039
i've talked to almost everyone at length

3048
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:28,000
in the sour diesel original family

3049
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:29,519
you know

3050
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,238
um and i

3051

i never heard [ __ ] diesel but you know

3052
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:36,638
there you go yeah yeah i don't know why

3053
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:38,319
that's in my memory bank but yeah that's

3054
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:40,000
one of the names of my memory bank maybe

3055
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:42,960
that's a secret they kept amongst the

3056
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,760
boys yeah just a few of the boys

3057

the boys you know yeah just a few just a

3058
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:49,600

3116
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:55,118
convince me to open myself up to lots of

3117
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,800
criticism and hate and people throwing

3118

3126
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,960
you know doing some uh doing or

3127
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:15,198
releasing some stuff that might be very

3128
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,079
different than what is currently out

3129
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:17,759
there

3130
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,238
um and i don't know if people would be

3131
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,079
into it or not but it's it's always been

3132
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:23,519
sort of a you know a passion thing for

3133
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:25,519
me or whatever so

3134
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,480

3135
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,320
um

3136
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,118

3137
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:30,719
dude

3138
01:51:29,118 --> 01:51:32,238
we got pretty far in but there's a lot

3139
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:33,760
that like people are talking about that

3140
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:36,399
i've been writing down that i want to go

3141
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,000
back and touch onto there was i will say

3142
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,679
there was a there was a [ __ ] ton of

3143
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
really good questions

3144
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:43,599
this week a lot of them i missed because

3145
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,039
it's it's you might it's like rubbing

3146
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:47,520
your head and patting your stomach at

3147
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:50,238
the same time it's really hard to like

3148
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:52,560
talk intelligently in a flowing form and

3149
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:54,399
then think about like four or five cool

3150
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,239
questions all at the same time that you

3151
01:51:54,399 --> 01:51:58,399
see scroll by

3152
01:51:56,238 --> 01:52:00,559
so um matt's been taking notes we'll try

3153
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:02,799
to get we'll try to expand it and this

3154
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:04,639
show is you know as much as it's about

3155

it's for you guys too

3158
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,920
so hit us up all the time with questions

3159
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:15,519
or you know or ideas or thoughts on like

3160
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,719
what you might want to hear

3161
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,040
you know

3162
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:20,560
um yeah and i mean i'm not i'm not like

3163
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:22,639
that that's the whole thing people i've

3164
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,080
you know uh caleb matt other people

3165
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,679
they've been trying for years to not

3166
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:28,000
only get me to talk but to get me to

3167
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:29,760
like publicly release stuff

3168
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,198
and it's like it's kind of a [ __ ] being

3169
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,960
a public breeder

3170
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:35,359
so yeah i've been kind of hesitant to

3171
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:37,198
like open myself up to like a bunch of

3172
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:39,519
criticism and [ __ ]

3173
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:41,118
um yeah but i might i don't know you

3174
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,080
know deserves it there's a lot of

3175
01:52:41,118 --> 01:52:43,920
feeling

3176
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:46,399
there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

3177
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:48,399
cool things i think that get passed over

3178
01:52:46,399 --> 01:52:49,920
with fads

3179
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:51,920
so you know

3180
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,359
uh we are almost at two hours so i don't

3181
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,840
know i mean maybe we could we're

3182
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:58,719
thinking about having shaw on next week

3183
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,400
that's right we could continue this um

3184
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:01,198
we could you know two hours is kind of

3185
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:03,519
long

3186
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:05,839
uh but maybe we'll figure out a format

3187
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,280
to do the rest of them fairly soon yeah

3188
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,840
yeah i like that idea and if you're a

3189
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:11,198
part of the patreon and um the discord

3190
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,239

01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:14,399
for other clones you'd like to hear

3192

3194
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:20,000

3195
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,079
easier way for us to converse back and

3196
