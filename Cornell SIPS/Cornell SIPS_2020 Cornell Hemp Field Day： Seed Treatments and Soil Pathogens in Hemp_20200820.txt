[00:00.700 --> 00:05.480]  My name is Alan Taylor and I'm professor of seed science and technology at
[00:05.480 --> 00:10.720]  Cornell Agritech. My laboratory has been involved in hemp seed science and
[00:10.720 --> 00:16.560]  technology research since the Cornell hemp team formed in 2017. What I'm going
[00:16.560 --> 00:22.080]  to speak about today is on our work on the research and development of hemp
[00:22.080 --> 00:27.800]  seed treatments. Gary Bergstrom is my cooperator in plant pathology as his
[00:27.800 --> 00:33.680]  laboratory is supportive in helping characterize the pathogens associated
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.560]  with disease seedlings from our research plots. We also have field trials at North
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.240]  Dakota State with Burton Johnson and Chuck Johnson and John Fike at Virginia
[00:45.240 --> 00:53.240]  Tech. So the focus of our work is on application technology to begin with to
[00:53.240 --> 00:58.680]  have good methodology for seed treatment and coating technologies. This
[00:58.680 --> 01:05.640]  is a laboratory scale unit called a rotary pan technology, an R6 for a 6 inch
[01:05.640 --> 01:10.440]  diameter. The same technology is used for commercial scale equipment so anything
[01:10.440 --> 01:16.460]  that we do in the laboratory can quickly be scaled up to a larger. An issue that
[01:16.460 --> 01:20.720]  we had early on is that we need to ensure that we have uniformity of
[01:20.760 --> 01:26.480]  application over the seed surface and from seed to seed. We need to protect each
[01:26.480 --> 01:34.160]  seed from attack of soil borne pathogens at time of sowing. We'll take a step back
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.120]  and look at the biological market as there's a number of materials. Now this
[01:38.120 --> 01:42.880]  is not restricted to seed treatments. These could be foliar applications or
[01:42.880 --> 01:47.000]  soil applications and furrow applications. We have bio fertilizers and
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.520]  biostimulants which we're not going to be talking about even though my
[01:51.520 --> 01:55.080]  laboratory is working with biostimulant seed treatments but we're going to focus
[01:55.080 --> 02:00.320]  on biological control products and particularly the biopesticides. So we're
[02:00.320 --> 02:05.680]  going to kind of focus in on that area. So under the biopesticides we have
[02:05.680 --> 02:11.080]  biochemicals. They may be kind of a mineral based. They can be either formed
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.280]  from copper or phosphites. We have examples of those. Microbials we normally
[02:16.280 --> 02:20.960]  think of a microbial as a biopesticide but they're not the only materials but
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.720]  in this case we are using specific seed treatments from bacillus and
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.920]  trichoderma and with others and these are commercial formulations that we are
[02:30.920 --> 02:36.920]  testing as seed treatments. So this is our list of 12 seed treatments that we
[02:36.920 --> 02:43.000]  have. Those in green are the biologicals. First thing we have to do is test the
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.920]  seed treatment application rate. We want to ensure that there's no phytotoxicity
[02:47.920 --> 02:53.600]  from the seed treatments. Those in red are the biochemicals. Safeguard is an
[02:53.600 --> 02:58.320]  organic copper. The prudent is a phosphate material and then the group at
[02:58.320 --> 03:04.160]  the bottom in blue apron XL maximum you probably recognize as these are widely
[03:04.160 --> 03:13.930]  labeled on vegetables and field crops for as seed treatments. So first let's
[03:13.970 --> 03:19.570]  look at what happens to seeds after they're planted. We start off here in the
[03:19.570 --> 03:24.690]  laboratory to look at hemp seeds germinate very rapidly. So in this
[03:24.690 --> 03:29.570]  pathogen infested soil that we have the soil sprinkled over on top during the
[03:29.570 --> 03:35.090]  germination process after four days the seeds germinate very rapidly. After seven
[03:35.090 --> 03:40.970]  days many of the seedlings have died or are dying and by ten days non-treated
[03:40.970 --> 03:46.890]  seeds are killed. So this is a way that we can use a laboratory screening method
[03:46.890 --> 03:53.330]  taking advantage of a naturally pathogen infested soil to go ahead
[03:53.330 --> 03:59.130]  and to test these seed treatments before we actually go to the field. But our
[03:59.130 --> 04:04.730]  primary interest in showing you today is the field data. This is our two we have
[04:04.730 --> 04:10.570]  two field studies at Cornell. The first one planted on June 12th. Again now we
[04:10.650 --> 04:14.410]  can see how this color coding is going to help us. The black bar on the left is
[04:14.410 --> 04:18.770]  the control non-treated. You see all the green treatments and none of the
[04:18.770 --> 04:24.290]  biologicals doing any better than the control. However the safeguard the
[04:24.290 --> 04:28.930]  organic copper the prudent the phosphate doing quite well and as good as one of
[04:28.930 --> 04:35.570]  our best apron maximum treatments. So this looks very promising. We have a
[04:35.570 --> 04:42.890]  second study also in Ithaca this year planted on June 26th. Again the same
[04:42.890 --> 04:47.930]  trend is the biologicals not performing any better than the non-treated control.
[04:47.930 --> 04:53.370]  We are seeing improvements with both the safeguard in particular the safeguard
[04:53.370 --> 04:58.610]  and the prudent and again it's comparable to our best apron maximum
[04:58.610 --> 05:04.770]  treatment as the chemical seed treatment. This is where Gary's laboratory was
[05:05.130 --> 05:10.050]  instrumental in supporting this project. We would see the symptoms in the field
[05:10.050 --> 05:15.650]  as far as diseased seedlings. His laboratory has done the characterization
[05:15.650 --> 05:20.450]  of what pathogens are associated with those diseased seedlings. So we can see
[05:20.450 --> 05:25.250]  here and the picture on the the photo at the bottom on the left indicative of
[05:25.250 --> 05:30.330]  those testing positive for fusarium species. The picture on the lower right
[05:30.330 --> 05:36.690]  having pythium species present. Gary's laboratory is still ongoing work to
[05:36.690 --> 05:42.090]  characterize the species of these along with other samples that we have provided
[05:42.090 --> 05:47.690]  to their lab. As I said this is a multi-state project and being a
[05:47.690 --> 05:54.770]  multi-state project is good in that we do not want to simply have seeds that
[05:54.770 --> 05:59.570]  are tested in Cornell that only have good control in the Northeast. So we've
[05:59.570 --> 06:04.250]  expanded the testing. We have seed testing at Virginia Tech in the
[06:04.250 --> 06:11.490]  southern region and then North Dakota State in the north central region. Again
[06:11.490 --> 06:16.370]  the same color coding and the same scheme as we had in our previous slides.
[06:16.370 --> 06:22.450]  We see safeguard and prudent doing very well and this is from one study we have.
[06:22.450 --> 06:27.050]  There'll be one more study coming with data this fall from Virginia Tech. And
[06:27.290 --> 06:31.370]  then North Dakota State in this case we're seeing the chemical seed
[06:31.370 --> 06:37.490]  treatments doing quite well and this one across the board but still we're seeing
[06:37.490 --> 06:43.610]  for example safeguard doing a nice job. So we're gathering information now and
[06:43.610 --> 06:49.210]  the very good picture is that there we're seeing some consistency in our
[06:49.210 --> 06:56.730]  results from field to field and from location to location within the regions
[06:56.890 --> 07:02.450]  of the United States. So let's go ahead and summarize where we're at with this.
[07:02.450 --> 07:07.730]  Our biochemical seed treatments, the safeguard which was the organic copper
[07:07.730 --> 07:13.130]  and the prudent which is a phosphite had good efficacy in all of the studies. The
[07:13.130 --> 07:18.610]  data that we have in hand at this point in time. The chemical seed treatments
[07:18.610 --> 07:23.930]  Apron XL and Maxim still had good efficacy and again these are tried and
[07:23.930 --> 07:30.770]  true chemical seed treatments that are widely labeled. Unfortunately after two
[07:30.770 --> 07:34.970]  years of work where Syngenta was initially very interested in this
[07:34.970 --> 07:41.250]  project Syngenta is no longer providing support for hemp on any particular
[07:41.250 --> 07:45.610]  application. So it could be Syngenta herbicides and things like that. They're
[07:45.610 --> 07:48.890]  not going to be supporting those hemp labels in the United States which is is
[07:49.170 --> 07:55.650]  a big setback. So we really need other chemical seed treatments from another
[07:55.650 --> 08:01.130]  company to test and we're looking into that at this time. Finally the
[08:01.130 --> 08:08.090]  biologicals and we've done now two years in a row trying to test a good range of
[08:08.090 --> 08:12.610]  commercially available and use biological seed treatments simply were
[08:12.610 --> 08:20.730]  not effective in our study to control damping off. So I want to thank people
[08:20.730 --> 08:27.890]  first of all in my laboratory Hillary Maitin. Hillary kind of headed up all the
[08:27.890 --> 08:34.730]  field studies that you had as well as gathering data from the other states and
[08:34.730 --> 08:39.810]  then summarizing some of the data in the graphs that you're seeing. Michael Luce
[08:39.810 --> 08:44.610]  in my laboratory has done all the seed treatment application a lot of the in-
[08:44.610 --> 08:51.210]  house testing as far as germination, soil testing, and I saw bioassay. Masi's done a
[08:51.210 --> 08:55.650]  lot of the photographic work and other support work for this project. So very
[08:55.650 --> 09:00.050]  nice team that I'm very fortunate to have people working with me on this
[09:00.050 --> 09:07.370]  project. In Gary's laboratory Jen Starr was really instrumental in working with
[09:07.490 --> 09:12.330]  Hillary taking those field samples and doing the characterization and Kevin in
[09:12.330 --> 09:16.890]  Gary's lab is helping at the molecular characterization so we know what species
[09:16.890 --> 09:21.730]  are involved. Again we work very closely with the company registrants in other
[09:21.730 --> 09:25.970]  words the companies that actually are producing these. We're working directly
[09:25.970 --> 09:31.610]  with their R&D people to make sure that we're testing the best biological
[09:31.610 --> 09:36.210]  chemical biochemical treatment that they would have available for this project.
[09:36.330 --> 09:42.210]  And finally I want to thank support from IR4 but in particular for New York Ag
[09:42.210 --> 09:46.730]  and Markets for their continued support for this and for other Cornell hemp
[09:46.730 --> 09:51.210]  projects. Thank you very much.
