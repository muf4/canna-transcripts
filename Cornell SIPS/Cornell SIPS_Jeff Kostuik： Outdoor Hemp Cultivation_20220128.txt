[00:00.640 --> 00:04.640]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.640 --> 00:24.000]  So to all of our participants, welcome to the inaugural Hemp 411 seminar series.
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.000]  We are so thrilled that you're here.
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  There are so many people that have come together to make this a reality.
[00:35.000 --> 00:44.000]  And I, for one, am absolutely jazzed to see y'all here and your interest in hemp.
[00:44.000 --> 01:01.000]  So my name is Zachary Stancil. I am the USDA hemp germplasm curator. So I want to very briefly tell you a little bit about our work, and why we wanted to host Hemp 411.
[01:01.000 --> 01:17.000]  So, you know, I'm curious, how many of y'all have heard of the idea of a seed library. So a seed library is in many ways kind of like a regular library but instead of books, we hold these collections of different kinds of seeds.
[01:17.000 --> 01:28.000]  So our work here in Geneva, New York, is to establish a collection of many different diverse varieties of hemp.
[01:28.000 --> 01:41.000]  Our work is going to be collecting, growing out, collecting new seeds and distributing these hemp varieties to many different people all over the world.
[01:41.000 --> 01:56.000]  So, kind of like a regular library, those seeds can be checked out, you don't have to return them, by plant scientists, plant breeders, educators and many other groups of people.
[01:56.000 --> 02:15.000]  So we hope that these efforts will not only help protect the genetic diversity of hemp, but allow universities, companies, farmers, and ultimately everyone to benefit from the almost uncountably diverse uses of hemp.
[02:16.000 --> 02:36.000]  So that's kind of, you know, the nuts and bolts scientific element of our work, but, you know, in the course of many conversations, we are realizing that we're very passionate about making hemp science be a much more welcoming, inclusive and diverse space,
[02:37.000 --> 02:55.000]  especially to new scientists. I'm hoping that some of the people in this call have a future in hemp science research or hemp entrepreneurship, and we want to provide you information and resources that can enable you to follow those dreams.
[02:56.000 --> 03:21.000]  So, very quickly, I want to thank our, especially thank our, everyone's welcome here but we really want to thank folks from Alabama A&M, Alcorn, Central State, Dell State, Florida A&M, Fort Valley, Kentucky State, Langston U, Lincoln U, North Carolina A&T State, Prairie View A&M, South Carolina State, I'm from South Carolina, shout out.
[03:22.000 --> 03:35.000]  Southern University, Tennessee State, Tuskegee University of Arkansas, Heinbluff University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Virginia State, and last but not least, Virginia State University.
[03:35.000 --> 03:53.000]  I want to thank Tony Baracco and George Stack for really doing a ton of the logistics work and inviting so many awesome speakers to this series as well as GEMMA Autumn, Autumn candidate Erin Rogers.
[03:53.000 --> 04:03.000]  So let's get down to what we're all here for today. I'm so excited to introduce all y'all to Jeff Kostchuk.
[04:03.000 --> 04:13.000]  So, Jeff is the director at Hemp Genetics International. He's been passionate about hemp since 1998.
[04:13.000 --> 04:25.000]  He is a seed grower. He studied agriculture at the University of Manitoba. In 2012, he got a bachelor's degree at Athabasca University.
[04:26.000 --> 04:39.000]  He was previously the director of the Canadian Hemp Trade Alliance, and he currently holds a position of the chair of the National Variety Trials Committee and Minor Use Regulations.
[04:39.000 --> 04:51.000]  So, once again, welcome. I present you Jeff. Actually I think Tony wants to say a little bit about question and answers and the overall format.
[04:51.000 --> 05:04.000]  As Jeff gets his screen ready. I just wanted to mention that if you guys have any questions throughout the lecture, please put them in the Q&A section tab. Do not put them in the chat tab.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  So everything in the Q&A section.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  If we can get through it all.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  I'll hopefully be read during the Q&A.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  So yeah, don't leave your questions till the end.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  All right.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  Take it away, Jeff.
[05:18.000 --> 05:26.000]  All right, good to go. I'm assuming you'll tell me if you can't see my screen, Tony, or somebody but that sounds like we hear me okay and the screen is good.
[05:26.000 --> 05:46.000]  All good. All right, we'll fire away. So thank you very much, Zach for the introduction. I'll get a little bit into my background and how I got involved with hemp during the presentation also but what I'd like to do I guess is kind of this, it's, you know, really, realistically, I guess it's a bit of a dated presentation already.
[05:47.000 --> 06:11.000]  But as Zachary said I've been involved with the hemp industry, mostly, I would say as an applied research agronomist to start with, it's the province of Manitoba so that's kind of where I got my background in and how I got started in hemp and became known as the hemp guy contact for Manitoba and then in 2015 switched over to industry and got involved with Hemp Genetics International.
[06:12.000 --> 06:19.000]  So, we'll go through a few things I'll try to explain now what we're going to be looking at.
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.000]  There we go.
[06:20.000 --> 06:29.000]  Okay, so basically it really doesn't matter if we're talking about growing hemp for cannabinoid extraction for fiber, or for grain production.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.000]  So some of these things are applicable to all three of those economic returns for hemp.
[06:37.000 --> 06:53.000]  But some of the things that you need to ask yourself, whether you're a producer or a processor so obviously what is the market demanding, and what you want to do is be able to, you need to be able to identify what that market is demanding, how can you supply,
[06:54.000 --> 07:01.000]  especially as a farmer, and us as agronomists and researchers, how can we assist farmers to supply high quality hemp.
[07:01.000 --> 07:12.000]  And what I suggest is it's a systematic approach required to maximize quality. So it's like any other commodity or crop that we grow so proper planning is a necessity.
[07:13.000 --> 07:24.000]  Obviously, we're all here together on the webinar and that's a part of it. Agronomics, as I said, as a recovering applied research agronomist, that's dear to my heart.
[07:24.000 --> 07:38.000]  And it's a crop that will confuse you sometimes so there's different harvest and storage practices that you have to be aware of, you know, really with regards to all again all three aspects of grain, fiber, and cannabinoid.
[07:39.000 --> 07:52.000]  So when we look at agronomy you know we all know that we need to take a look at field selection, crop rotation, variety selection, seeding, everything seeding, fertility, weed control, harvest.
[07:53.000 --> 08:03.000]  So field selection. So, Zachary and I were discussing a little bit just earlier said you know what was it like, you know, getting involved with hemp in Canada in 1998.
[08:03.000 --> 08:17.000]  I said it's probably not much different than in the US where I think this is going on to a certain degree where we had interested growers, but they would never kind of have their field sort of in their best fields.
[08:17.000 --> 08:23.000]  The field would be kind of in the back quarter, the back 40, you know, kind of maybe not the best soil.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  So we had a ton of catastrophes because of that.
[08:27.000 --> 08:41.000]  Nobody really wanted to sort of be the coffee shop talk as far as that person's growing hemp you know they're this and that so you know we've come miles and miles from that we're now when we talk to growers it's more about the stuff that we're going to talk
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  about today so crop rotation history.
[08:44.000 --> 08:51.000]  So herbicide history is, is extremely important and that falls in place, of course, with crop rotation.
[08:51.000 --> 09:00.000]  But with herbicide history that hemp is quite susceptible to most herbicides, and is quite
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.000]  a lot of the residual herbicides can cause a problem with establishment and establishment is one of the toughest things to get your head wrapped around with him.
[09:10.000 --> 09:23.000]  Fertility levels. I know first starting out, you know you go to the University of Google and everybody's saying well this crop can grow without any, any nutrients whatsoever you don't have to take care of it you just put it on the ground and it's going
[09:24.000 --> 09:37.000]  to grow and, and, you know, save the world essentially which, which it can, but it's a tall plant it's an aggressive plant which means that it needs its nutrients so it is not a nitrogen fixer as also I've seen occasionally.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  It's a high user of nitrogen high user of potassium.
[09:41.000 --> 09:49.000]  So we have to make sure that we can feed that crop accordingly, because it is a crop now it's not just something that's grown for the fun of it.
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  What kind of are what are problem leads of hemp. It's the same thing.
[09:54.000 --> 10:13.000]  Hemp does not necessarily have a strong or even an allele pathic effect on other weeds, it relies on its plant structure the biomass to shade out weeds and rob it rob weeds of the nutrients so the advantage comes when you can get ahead when the plant
[10:14.000 --> 10:28.000]  can certainly be issues where, where, you know, if the week competitions either head to head or we have a head start hemp will have a very difficult time getting through problem leads so again that's another sort of myth that we need to make sure that people are
[10:28.000 --> 10:42.000]  aware of and trash management and I shouldn't actually have trash manager and there's two things here I guess that you know it can be considered, you know, the one man's trash is another man's treasure so the fiber industry, how do we, you know, the grain
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.000]  industry was what was really moving the industry and forward in Canada for a number of years over the last five years we were moving more into.
[10:50.000 --> 11:08.000]  Again, turning that lemon into lemonade so that fiber obviously has an extremely high value. And if you're not, if you do not have an area where you can get rid of your fiber in an economic fashion or a way to to turn it into some cash for you.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  So that's a real issue as far as what crops come in next year so I shouldn't say trash management I should just say residue management.
[11:16.000 --> 11:32.000]  So what kind of soil properties are we looking for so again, we want to basically a, you know, kind of your best soil some moderate soil texture, loam or or clay loam sandy loam, it's not to say that hemp couldn't do well on heavy clays, but it really just
[11:33.000 --> 11:43.000]  And so that is the issue and and compaction, essentially actually any, any soil irregularity, sorry.
[11:43.000 --> 11:57.000]  In, in, in your field, you know if you think you got a perfectly good field that's from corner to corner, not going to cause you any problems then then hemp will be the one crop that will show you where your problems are so sandy soils are good because
[11:57.000 --> 12:10.000]  they actually, you know, you don't have the issue of sand standing water but it does need moisture needs upwards of 12 to 15 inches of moisture you know to reach it so you know genetic potential for yields.
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.000]  So non saline good tilth you know, in other words, some of your best land, you'd want to be planting hemp on.
[12:19.000 --> 12:39.000]  This is what happens when we don't have that internal drainage or, or if we get significant rain effect which seems to be just about every second rain event is a significant one so this was a section of hemp for seed production and you can see where the, you know, he was able to seed
[12:40.000 --> 12:57.000]  everything we had a significant rain event come when the crop was probably about, you know, probably about two weeks after, and you could definitely see anywhere where the water was ponding for a little while or sitting hemp did not take that very well, we've got weeds
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  growing in there.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  You can see right in the bottom right hand corner that's the compaction issue that's where the trucks come into the field so.
[13:05.000 --> 13:15.000]  So, yeah, if there's anywhere in the field that you think has a soil type issue then hemp is going to give you an indicator of that.
[13:15.000 --> 13:27.000]  So variety selection and this is this is becoming more and more important we've got a number of breeding companies in the US now developing hemp varieties.
[13:28.000 --> 13:41.000]  So, you know, I've been in the business since about 2005 2006 with varieties but you can see just from this photo alone this again is from my good old days as they say so we've got a difference in height here we've got some male flowers in this bright
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  you can see the white.
[13:43.000 --> 13:56.000]  We've got some money issues varieties, these are a diet, you know what yields better does a diet you should feel better than a money issues and why is there a money issue so we'll, we'll kind of tap into that a little bit here so when we're looking at variety selection
[13:56.000 --> 14:10.000]  out there, you know I was just kind of looking at all the shout outs and the hellos. We've got a lot of researchers, a lot of research institutes hemp research data is somewhat scarce, and this is, you know, again, dear to my heart as an agronomist
[14:11.000 --> 14:25.000]  I need to get that a good handle on what research is out there and it has to be in my mind it has to be replicated data that's analyzed localized data, obviously the more site years the better.
[14:25.000 --> 14:35.000]  It's just all of the things that we know that are important for making those decisions, the coefficient of variation etc. All of those things need to be addressed.
[14:35.000 --> 14:47.000]  But some of the things I guess just from an economic standpoint are obviously yield, if we're talking about grain fiber or cannabinoid CBD yield is is the king right.
[14:47.000 --> 15:04.000]  When it comes into both again fiber and brain height is very important we want more biomass for the fiber crops, we want less biomass more seed head for for the grain varieties that you can still easily harvest disease susceptibility, there are
[15:04.000 --> 15:19.000]  different cultivars that are more susceptible than others to the likes of the tritis or sclerotinia, a number of different things, herbicide tolerance.
[15:19.000 --> 15:37.000]  I chair the minor use committee for the CHTA and work with the IR4 program in the US and there are differences in herbicide tolerance and I'll just name one as a as a as a one that we have use for in Canada is called bromoxynil so not
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  bromoxynyl but bromoxynil or bacterial.
[15:41.000 --> 15:55.000]  You know, a lot of all of the HDI varieties have a extremely high tolerance of bromoxynil, but there's some cultivars out there that if you drove by even with the herbicide in the back of your truck you're going to see some leaf browning and potentially
[15:55.000 --> 16:02.000]  some issues. Many times you get that and with hemp's aggressive growth nature it will grow through that but there are differences.
[16:03.000 --> 16:16.000]  maturity so a lot of the varieties there are photo period sensitive so it's not as it's not as a big a deal if you're at the same latitude but there certainly are differences between some varieties.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  Shelling is a big one again on the grain side of things.
[16:21.000 --> 16:28.000]  We'll show some pictures shortly but as hemp matures and dries down the brack material that's surrounding and protecting the seed
[16:28.000 --> 16:37.000]  basically opens up and that seed is exposed so whether it's birds and again birds is a huge one and I'm not sure if I got birds on here but
[16:38.000 --> 16:46.000]  shelling is associated also with birds and if you're doing any sort of research, make sure that you have a bird control measure in place of some sort.
[16:47.000 --> 16:58.000]  It's one thing to have a quarter section 160 acre field and have a few blackbirds circling it but you get a flock of blackbirds in a research plot and they'll do you some damage in a very short period of time.
[16:59.000 --> 17:07.000]  There was one question already about cannabinoid content and I'll put THC in that so there is a variance between
[17:09.000 --> 17:20.000]  there is a variance between varieties there too and seed size on the grain side of things it's quite important to as as a farmer, a smaller seed size ends up your
[17:21.000 --> 17:36.000]  your screenings, you know, that seed that when the seed cleaner takes it to get it ready for to clean it for a processor, you could be losing a lot of seed just due to seed size so a large seed size, but then what's the composition?
[17:37.000 --> 17:47.000]  And we'll get into that as far as the size of the hull and hearts and how we can utilize that so there's lots to talk about there, lots to know and we've kind of gone through that.
[17:48.000 --> 18:00.000]  So I mentioned the phototropic plants, I think for most of us we kind of understand that so as the days get shorter the plant detects that so it starts to go into its
[18:01.000 --> 18:12.000]  it's a reproductive cycles I guess or puts some of that energy into reproduction as opposed to just biomass growth and the issue that we have here is when we're moving some of the genetics from Canada
[18:13.000 --> 18:20.000]  further in latitude certainly that plant, you know, can't detect the sunlight difference like say if we moved
[18:21.000 --> 18:36.000]  one of our varieties into Texas or Florida, there just isn't enough of a difference in day length early in the season that the plant is tricked into thinking that it already has to start setting seed so we end up getting flowering happening way too early and stuff so
[18:37.000 --> 18:46.000]  so that's it has to be noted and there's genetics and there's ways that we can start to work around that but that's some of the issue.
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.000]  And then on the cannibal side, feminized seed, what is feminized seed? So feminized obviously is the female
[18:53.000 --> 19:11.000]  in a dioecious crop. Generally speaking, it favours a little bit more of the female than male so probably for most of us in the field, I guess we'll see about 60 to 60, 55 to 60% female versus 40 to 45%
[19:12.000 --> 19:31.000]  male plants in there and a monoecious variety, that ratio is essentially the same on a monoecious plant. So what I found in the past, there might be a slight yield advantage to a monoecious plant, but on a dioecious side, there doesn't seem to be as much of a difference for yield.
[19:31.000 --> 19:50.000]  Where it makes the differences on fibre quality because those male plants die off early and that fibre is much different than what the dioecious or the female plant is as it tends to live a little bit longer and do a little more work, just kind of like what happens in real life, I think, for most of us.
[19:50.000 --> 19:58.000]  But feminized, of course, on the CBD side, we just want to be growing. We don't want that energy spent on seed production, we want it spent on cannibal production.
[19:59.000 --> 20:17.000]  Autoflower is the opposite of phototropic, so there are some autoflower traits and some varieties have autoflower traits where they will be triggered more so on days after planting as opposed to day length and daylight intensity.
[20:18.000 --> 20:28.000]  So that seems to be much more, it came much more from the marijuana genetics side of things, not a lot of the straight hemp genetics have that autoflower trait in them.
[20:28.000 --> 20:41.000]  So that's, you know, it's of concern, it's of interest to breeders on how to trick the plant into being able to be adapted in different areas around the world.
[20:42.000 --> 20:53.000]  So this kind of gives you an idea. So this is what's called the list of approved cultivars in Canada and a variety has to be on this list for a grower to grow it commercially in Canada.
[20:53.000 --> 21:01.000]  And the requirements are Health Canada is part of the regulatory board, and so they basically they test for THC essentially.
[21:02.000 --> 21:14.000]  So all the varieties that are on this board have been tested numerous times, and they've been approved by Health Canada that they will consistently or predominantly stay below that 0.3% THC.
[21:14.000 --> 21:27.000]  The second part of that is the Canadian Seed Growers Association. So we have to grow nothing but certified pedigreed seeds, sorry. So at the very least the certified level registered or breeder.
[21:27.000 --> 21:38.000]  That's where the testing is done on the pedigree level. So a farmer, when he grows the crop, he doesn't even have to test at that point in time. The testing for that seed lot happens at the breeder stage of that.
[21:38.000 --> 21:52.000]  That breeder seed is planted to get registered seed, the registered seed is also tested. So again, as a registered or a pedigreed seed grower, that's my responsibility to test that and send that away for analysis.
[21:52.000 --> 22:06.000]  And then when it goes into certified seed and that certified seed is sold to a farmer, there's no longer a need for testing. And so it's something that, you know, I'm also on the HIA Seed and Grains Committee and I like this for that reason alone.
[22:06.000 --> 22:26.000]  There's extra regulations there. But, you know, for the farmer, he knows if it's a pedigreed, it's third party inspected, there's stability, uniformity and a difference between. So we know, he knows what's in that bag, he knows what the percentage or the germination percentage is.
[22:26.000 --> 22:44.000]  As a processor, if you're contracting to grow that, you know what you're getting to. So it's kind of, I think, a good risk mitigator in the industry as a whole. So when we're seeding with hemp, it's a small seed, a little bit, about three quarters the size of wheat, perhaps.
[22:44.000 --> 23:10.000]  But we want to seed shallow. A half inch is maybe, you know, that's kind of borderline. Half to an inch is probably as deep as you would like to go. On the grain side of things, we target a 25 to 30 pound per acre seeding rate. And of course, there's a difference in seed size. So we need to know what that, for us, the thousand kernel weight or how, you know, how many seeds are in a pound. So we need to make sure that we have that calculation done.
[23:11.000 --> 23:32.000]  The higher seeding rates for fiber, again, if we have a lower seeding rate, that plant has more time to spread out a little bit more, has more space. The internodes get closer together, it branches more. And when those internodes get closer together, and it's not reaching for the sun or not, you know, kind of competing for the sunlight, those internodes kind of get closer together.
[23:33.000 --> 23:41.000]  What we want for fiber are those longer internodes, so we have a more high quality fiber. Everywhere there's an internode, that's kind of a break in the fiber, essentially.
[23:43.000 --> 24:01.000]  Warm soils. Now this one, you know, we're getting a lot of, I wouldn't say pushback, but there's a lot of observations which are extremely true that when hemp is seeded, or sorry, when hemp is harvested and we've got some seed left on the ground, that seed, doesn't matter if you're in Manitoba, where I am right now,
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  or anywhere, if it has an opportunity to germinate, it will, under a lot lower soil conditions. You will see that.
[24:10.000 --> 24:25.000]  50 to 55 is when the majority of seeds, so one of the biggest issues is mortality, plant mortality. So, what we're seeing, what I've seen in the past is anywhere from 20 to 70% seed mortality, predominantly because of cold, wet soils.
[24:25.000 --> 24:37.000]  And so we want to make sure that we have it, you know, give that seed every chance that it can, because it's going to have a natural mortality in there, you know, pythium, other things, root diseases can be an issue.
[24:38.000 --> 24:49.000]  But our target plant stand in doing so is about 10 to 12 plants per square foot for the grain side of things, and of course higher for fiber.
[24:49.000 --> 25:01.000]  Equipment, just about anything can be used, planters, double disc drills, air seeders, and for us, the predominant choice of equipment here on the prairies is our air seeders.
[25:02.000 --> 25:13.000]  And in that case, we just want to make sure that we lower the fan speed because they will get basically some, the manifold where that seed starts bouncing around turns into a little bit of a coffee grinder.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  And that's when you open up that cap, you'll see it just mushes the seed. It's a very sensitive seed.
[25:20.000 --> 25:35.000]  This is just, again, a little bit of a, to give you an idea, if we look at the maximum thousand kernel weight, so we've got, you know, Alissa here, which is a parkland variety at 19, down to, I believe, where can we see, you know,
[25:35.000 --> 25:46.000]  and, you know, finola is one that is a very, it's not even on here, no, here we are, finola at 14.6 grams per thousand kernels, so a much smaller seed.
[25:47.000 --> 25:55.000]  So that adjusts your seeding rate, so we can go anywhere from 18 pounds up to 24 or 25 pounds, so that's the importance of making sure that you do that calculation.
[25:56.000 --> 26:09.000]  So this is just a picture of our farm. This is our air seeder. We use predominantly anhydrous ammonia as our nitrogen source. The seed is in the tank, our phosphate fertilizer, potassium fertilizer is in there.
[26:10.000 --> 26:17.000]  If you can see my mouse over this manifold right here is where, you know, we've got to check that often, so make sure that we have the wind
[26:17.000 --> 26:24.000]  lowered more so than wheat or even canola, because as it comes off this primary
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.000]  distribution point here into these hoses, this is where the damage is done. So if that's not turned down, we have a heck of a mess there and the potential for
[26:34.000 --> 26:44.000]  clogging of the air hose. So a little bit on fertility. We did a fertility nutrient uptake study some time ago, I think it was about 2004 or 2005 again,
[26:44.000 --> 26:55.000]  with one of our taller varieties at that point. So you can see in comparison to canola is what we did because that was really our other cash crop.
[26:55.000 --> 27:05.000]  So when we're talking about total plant nutrient uptake, as we know, kilograms per hectare can be relatively switched over to pounds per acre,
[27:06.000 --> 27:14.000]  I think less than 10%, something like that. Not much of an issue, but you can, you know, relatively speaking, you can compare. So as far as nitrogen goes,
[27:14.000 --> 27:23.000]  we found that hemp was using up to 200 pounds of nitrogen in the growth cycle, of which we've got 40 pounds of nitrogen that was captured in the grain itself.
[27:23.000 --> 27:33.000]  So if you're taking that grain to a processor off the field, you know that on an average yield of say 2000 pounds, or sorry, 1000 pounds or 1500 pounds of grain,
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  you're taking about 40 pounds per acre of nitrogen off with an uptake of about six and a half. You know, canola, we're taking more off.
[27:42.000 --> 27:56.000]  So we got to replace more nitrogen after the fact. So a lot of this nitrogen is tied up in the stock, which will leach back into the ground if we can make sure that we have some sort of a ready process or an opportunity for that straw to take on some moisture.
[27:57.000 --> 28:16.000]  Phosphate here, 47 pounds, very similar to canola. And in the grain, we're taking 19. The big one here too is potassium. So if we are into the fiber industry, taking off the crop green, not long, ready to happen, you know, we need to keep a good eye on those potassium levels because
[28:16.000 --> 28:35.000]  the total plant uptake, of course, is quite high. We're not taking much off in the grain. It's again tied up mostly in that stock. So it can be leached back in, but you do need to be aware of that. And of course, it needs that much potassium for, you know, for straw strength, which makes sense. It's a tall crop, once again.
[28:36.000 --> 28:54.000]  Some of the disease issues, you know, sclerotinia seems to be about one of the biggest ones. You can see the sclerotia body here within the stock. That's going to drop down and create those apothecia that, and there's so many hosts for sclerotinia, including soybeans, for us, canola.
[28:55.000 --> 29:05.000]  So that's another one that we have to make sure to keep an eye on. To date, we haven't seen, you know, I haven't seen an absolute catastrophe on this, but there's a certain percentage for sure.
[29:06.000 --> 29:22.000]  The other one, botrytis or white mold, we see this often also. It's kind of the same thing. It's for us on the prairies again. I think if we move sort of the northeast or eastern more humid areas in the US, that's going to become more of an issue.
[29:22.000 --> 29:36.000]  So again, there's some varieties that can handle or have a bit more of a resistance to these diseases, but on the grain side of things, these are some of the ones that are causing an issue in Canada, I guess, predominantly.
[29:37.000 --> 29:55.000]  Insects. We've got a European corn borer on the left here. We don't have a lot of corn where I'm at yet, but we did happen to find one of these in the stock, actually in the stem, starting to cause issues. So that one is of concern.
[29:55.000 --> 30:11.000]  The middle here is a Bertha armyworm, which basically the foliage feeders, like the grasshopper on the right here. I mean, there's so much biomass there, they just seem to eat a bunch of it and then hop away, and thus we have a very extensive, extensive infestation.
[30:11.000 --> 30:33.000]  And like Japanese beetle, I think is a huge one in the US too that I've seen hemp get basically stripped because of that. So I think for the most part, the seed heads are protected again from the trichomes. We see a lot of aphids in the greenhouse production is different when we're outside, not quite the same.
[30:34.000 --> 30:57.000]  Frost up here in Canada, you know, every second day we can get a frost. And in fact, in one summer we had a frost every month. But here was a seeding date study that I was trialing. So I had different seeding dates with crop at different plant stages. So we went right from the beginning of May, seeded right up to the first week of July, actually.
[30:58.000 --> 31:21.000]  So we got this frost May 30th minus 4.7. So that's just just below freezing, but you know, hard enough for a killing frost. You can see the smaller seedlings here, the yellowing, some corrosive there just from stress. Not as much of an effect on the larger ones, the earlier seeded. So if they can get established, again, we're okay, but it's just getting them out of the ground.
[31:22.000 --> 31:33.000]  In comparison, here's a soybean that was decimated and this is flax that had to be reseeded. So it seems to be able to handle frost on both sides of both spring and fall.
[31:34.000 --> 31:52.000]  Here's a picture of a halelope field. It was one of our customers. Believe it or not, he left this and this isn't the field that he has on the right hand side. But this is essentially what happens. This was a later event, whether it was wind or this could have been wind. But you see how we call this goosenecking.
[31:53.000 --> 32:10.000]  And essentially, you know, as hard as it is or hard as it seems to be to get the plant established, it's a resilient bugger too. It just wants to grow all the time. And you can see here, starts reaching for the sun again, trying to compete and will do anything it can to survive.
[32:10.000 --> 32:34.000]  So the field on the left, this is what there was. There was basically sticks and he ended up with about 60% of the yield potential of that. He left it. That hailstorm happened in the middle of July. There was nothing else that he could do. So just to give you an idea, if you get something like that and just wait a couple days, see if you've got anything once again growing up out of those internals.
[32:35.000 --> 32:46.000]  And this is what I was mentioning earlier, you can kind of see in the top left where the bracken material is slowly drying down and the seed is being exposed, particularly the one where if you can see my mouse is just sitting there.
[32:47.000 --> 33:06.000]  You know, if a bird happens to be coming by, they see that, that's pretty juicy for them. So, but this is kind of the same time that we want to start looking at harvest. So timing of harvest is a tough one to tell because what we want to do to limit the amount of wrapping, and I'll show you pictures of what wrapping will look like.
[33:06.000 --> 33:31.000]  We try to harvest the crop when the grain moisture is in that 10 to 20% moisture range. You want to slow everything down, your cylinder speed, your rotor speed, open things up as far as your concave, because you can crack the seed and that will affect not only the germination if it's a seed crop, but it will also create some oxidation within the seed and it's an issue with oil quality.
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  And actually, if you ever have an open up a bag of hemp parts and you see browns in there, that's because it was the seed was cracked and it's oxidized.
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  So you need to dry it down below 10% for safe storage.
[33:45.000 --> 33:56.000]  There are a couple different moisture meters that you can have that actually do have hemp as far as being able to determine what that moisture is so very important to have that in there.
[33:57.000 --> 34:12.000]  So this is the combine that I use now. I'll show you, I don't have my other combine, but I was used to most of my previous experience was in a small plot combine and I use an old, old hay bee because it was easy enough to just shove a summer student in the back if it ever got plugged.
[34:12.000 --> 34:31.000]  Now, this one, a different story, we, you know, a Macdon header, we like the fingers here flip up. It's got a nice space on the draper. So the objective is to feed the hemp as straight as possible to have it go through the combine once or one and a half turns around the rotor and then up the back.
[34:31.000 --> 34:45.000]  And so that's kind of the objective there. Basically, there is of course no hemp. So I just superimposed hemp over top of this barley setting, but these are my settings in the combine. So my cylinder, or sorry, rotor speed is at 470.
[34:45.000 --> 35:08.000]  My concave clearance is at 26 millimeters. My wind is about 870 RPM. My chaffer is set at 16 and my sieve is set at six. So these settings are maybe a little bit larger than wheat. We've got a good flow of air because we've got so much chaff material, but slow it down and open things up a little bit because it does show or harvest quite easily.
[35:09.000 --> 35:27.000]  This is some of the wrapping issues that I mentioned. This is just a spline on the, on the drive shaft of the front of the John Deere. And that's just from going over the headlands where you've harvested. If there's a place for it to pick up and wrap it will. This is the cleaning fan of that.
[35:27.000 --> 35:54.000]  Also starting to wrap in there. So you do have to kind of get out there and make sure that you don't have these problems and forward thinking. Basically, there's a show that used to be called Red Green and his favorite tool is duct tape. It makes a genius out of most of us. So we just took some PVC pipe here, put some duct tape around it. Hemp didn't have a chance. This is that same shaft. Didn't have a chance to wrap on there.
[35:55.000 --> 36:06.000]  This is in the back of the combine, the back beater. This is an issue too. So it starts to wrap on the shaft there. And this is where you start to get smoke from the inside of the combine, which really makes a person kind of sit up and take notice.
[36:07.000 --> 36:21.000]  But the same thing. We just use some baler belting here, bolted that onto that beater and rubbing the side of the wall kind of cleared that issue. So there's as farmers, they, you know, they figure this stuff out and we're happy to sort of pass on that knowledge.
[36:22.000 --> 36:32.000]  For grain production, this is a necessity to always have a fire extinguisher. Even if you're doing plots, it's not a matter of if you'll smell smoke, it's when. For sure. It's just the nature of working with this crop.
[36:33.000 --> 36:44.000]  This is the Labtronics, what is it, 919 I guess it is, that will test for, you can go to the Canadian Grains Commission. There is a chart there for hemp.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Storage and handling. I'm not sure how I'm doing on time here.
[36:51.000 --> 36:52.000]  I have to sit on my feet.
[36:55.000 --> 37:02.000]  So we want to make sure that we have as little contamination as possible, especially for grain production.
[37:03.000 --> 37:14.000]  So cleaning your harvest and handling equipment, cleaning out the bins. There's really no kill stock within the process of hemp. You take the hemp from the farmer's bin, goes to a seed cleaner, from the seed cleaner it goes to the processor.
[37:15.000 --> 37:24.000]  Processor will either dehaul or cold press the oil. So there's an opportunity for a lot of micro toxins to form.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  So in Canada here, because of the canola industry, this is very prominent in our vineyards, dryers.
[37:32.000 --> 37:44.000]  These are just hopper bottom bins with aeration to make sure that as soon as we get, you know, even, we don't even fill semis anymore, we just use tandems.
[37:45.000 --> 38:01.000]  Get that product on air as quick as possible because if you're at 12% moisture, you know, those plate counts of micro toxins start to rise and that food quality can be in jeopardy.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  So a dryer can work, but again, low and slow is the idea there.
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  You want to make sure that you don't toast the hemp, that if it's toasted hemp, it doesn't stun by the processor.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  So the take home message, dry low and slow.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  What are the issues? Bacterial mold growth, time, temperature, moisture.
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.000]  Time is the only one that we can really have an effect on. So we need to get that, again, that product on air as quick as possible.
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.000]  So I don't think, you know, I'll just kind of briefly go through. So cannabinoid production in Canada, there's both outdoor and indoor.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  These are, again, a much different looking plant, hemp plant than the grain production.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  It's much more, I call them more of a Christmas tree look.
[38:45.000 --> 38:57.000]  Whereas I think what we're trying to do in the grain side of things is make it more like a palm tree where, you know, we've got two foot of seed head and maybe a foot of stock is the ideal amount of hemp that we want and stuff.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  So, again, we're trying to harvest these little trichomes is the objective there.
[39:03.000 --> 39:10.000]  It's much more, like I said, as a, like a Christmas tree type operation, which I'm sure most of you have seen this again.
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.000]  And it's only been since 2017 when Canada was able to start to actually play with the leaf material or the flower material.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  Up till then, we can only take the seed and the stock off the field.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  All of that had to stay on. So we are now just getting into more of these genetics.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  Just an example here. This is a variety of grain variety on the left. This is a CBD variety right down the middle.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  It's a replicated trial that I did on my own farm.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  You know, a couple weeks later, you can see the canopy closes in very rapidly.
[39:42.000 --> 39:53.000]  So there's not, you know, you have to make sure that you've got a weed control plan with that low planting rate as opposed to the grain, which is seeded at 25 pounds to the acre.
[39:53.000 --> 40:01.000]  This is probably seeded at, well, it's probably 2,500 plants per acre. So quite a difference.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  So autoflower varieties, I think, are an important part of it.
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.000]  Seed certification, again, I'm a strong proponent of seed certification to know what you're getting.
[40:15.000 --> 40:22.000]  And this is just a friend of mine that had some CBD production and sent a picture. I thought it looked kind of cool.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  This is his unit as far as harvesting for flower materials. So again, this is an outdoor grow.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  Same kind of combine that I have, just a newer one.
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  Basically, he sets his system so that he closes a sieve and chaffer down. The flower material goes into the back.
[40:38.000 --> 40:49.000]  A little bit of grain goes into the tank. That flower material in the back is then immediately frozen, I think, in his case, and then extracted for CBD.
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  This is from Formation Ag, a company out of Colorado that I've been doing trade shows with that we share videos back and forth.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  Kind of give you an idea what that looks like. This is their unit again.
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  So this is, again, outdoor production, which is the predominant one in Canada.
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  There are a few greenhouses, but just because of our cold winters, the production predominantly is outside.
[41:14.000 --> 41:22.000]  So with that, harvesting fiber, I mean, there's a ton of ways we're getting to know a little bit about this.
[41:23.000 --> 41:30.000]  I guess the only thing that I'll say about fiber, this is some of the fiber trials we were doing back in the day when I was a younger man, thinner man.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  Retting process. This is the one that I think that a lot of work needs to be done.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  The retting process is almost like in China, they've got a wet ret.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  We don't have enough experience here. We don't know what the environment is really going to do.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  We don't have even enough processing to tell us this is what they want.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  Most of the processing is for herd, which the retting process has an effect.
[41:55.000 --> 42:03.000]  But this was predominantly for producing high quality textile fiber, which is the highest value for hemp fiber.
[42:04.000 --> 42:10.000]  So with that, I think the moon is bright. This is a picture of my combine this year. I thought it was kind of cool.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  Then I had a beautiful sunset one day too.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  With that, I just want one more announcement.
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.000]  HGI is a company that I currently work for.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  As of two weeks ago, we are proud to announce that we have merged with a company called Tridium T3H, which is in the bottom right here.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  Tridium is the one that I mentioned that had a lot of the genetics on the CBD varieties.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  We just felt it was a good fit. Industry is still kind of small.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  Our new company will be called Bird Seed Solutions. I've been nominated or hired on as the general manager.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  My Twitter account is the same. This is my new address.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  Both Tony and all the people have both my hemp genetics and this address.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  I'm more than happy to answer as many questions as I can. I know I kind of went a little bit over time.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  With that, I'll turn it back over to our crew here. Thank you very much.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  Thank you, Jeff. That was incredible.
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.000]  Something tells me you probably could have gone for three more hours with a lot of high depth information.
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  That was really fun and fascinating. We greatly appreciate your time.
[43:22.000 --> 43:31.000]  I know Tony has been working on some of the questions here. Let's put Jeff through the ringer and see how many he can answer.
[43:32.000 --> 43:39.000]  First question. We have a lot of questions here. I'll try to get through as many as possible before the 3 p.m. mark.
[43:40.000 --> 43:50.000]  Babu from Lincoln University asks, can you please suggest a plot combine for us to harvest the grains?
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.000]  The one we used this year got fire after the fiber stuck inside. SP20.
[43:57.000 --> 44:05.000]  The new winter cider ones, I forget the name, they're Eclipse maybe. I think they're able to handle hemp now.
[44:06.000 --> 44:14.000]  What I was using again was an old Hagee 125B. If you can find one of those with an adjustable sieve, that will work.
[44:15.000 --> 44:26.000]  Zern makes one. The Zern came off when Hagee was bought by Wintersteiger. Those are the two I know.
[44:27.000 --> 44:34.000]  It's the beater you have to watch right under your butt there, Babu. That's generally where you'll get some wrapping.
[44:35.000 --> 44:43.000]  Lloyd Wilson asks, can you please give us a percentage of hemp grown outside versus indoor growing? I assume he means in Canada?
[44:44.000 --> 44:54.000]  For Canada, yeah. As far as hemp acres, I would say 99% is outdoor with a 1%.
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.000]  As far as the revenue, that's a different story, I guess, because of the high cannabinoid revenue.
[45:01.000 --> 45:15.000]  Particularly, there's some indoor grow operations in BC, a couple in Ontario. The western prairies are predominantly all outside, outdoor.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  Well into the 90s for sure.
[45:19.000 --> 45:28.000]  Iris asks, can seed serve for multiple use? Example, a seed that serves as CBD be used for grain slash fiber?
[45:29.000 --> 45:42.000]  The short answer is yes. The long answer is no. What we're finding, particularly because we are exporting product into the EU now, so THC is a concern, as is now becoming CBD.
[45:43.000 --> 45:52.000]  There are some tri-purpose crops where we've got a good grain yield or an average grain yield, lots of fiber, but still some high cannabinoid in that flour.
[45:53.000 --> 46:04.000]  High, I mean 4% to 6%. What we're finding is some of that CBD is being transferred onto the seed, goes into the food product, and the EU will start testing for that in the not too distant future.
[46:04.000 --> 46:17.000]  So it is a concern. So that's what I mean. Yes, it can. It is kind of the same seed. There might be some differences within oil content or amino acid profile, but yeah, the seed is basically the same.
[46:18.000 --> 46:25.000]  Laura asks, any research available on degradation of cannabinoids during storage in biomass?
[46:26.000 --> 46:36.000]  That's coming. We worked with the Prairie Machinery Institute in Canada. This is also a CHTA project on basically on both things.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  So now we know exactly how many CFUs we need to make sure that we can maintain that quality in hemp.
[46:42.000 --> 46:50.000]  And their second part of that project is how quickly we need to dry down hemp flour for cannabinoid production.
[46:51.000 --> 46:58.000]  Now, the degradation I think comes into more play when in regards to the overhandling of it. It's the same thing.
[46:59.000 --> 47:05.000]  So you're working with a wet material, probably 30-40% moisture at least. And so mold is going to be an issue.
[47:06.000 --> 47:12.000]  So you've got to make sure that you saw I quickly went through that one round baler there. It's called an oracle baler.
[47:12.000 --> 47:21.000]  So some people have put that biomass at a higher moisture, wrapped it with plastic. Once the oxygen was used up in that, so you do have some ensiling happen.
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.000]  Once the oxygen is used up, they were still able to have the majority of that product still be good.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  So that's another important one. I think there's more research that needs to be done.
[47:31.000 --> 47:47.000]  Dr. Ryan Robinson asks, are there dry disinfection methods that have been considered? I have been aware of non-thermal plasma treatments of seeds to prevent mold and bacterial growth.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  There's some that we use.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  Not infrared light.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  Basically, removing the oxygen, etc.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  I can't remember the name, it escapes me right now.
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.000]  There's things that are there, but most of them are kind of a wet solution.
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  And that does tend to leave a taste on hemp.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  So there's a few kill stops that are coming along.
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  The biggest one is that we just can't use heat because that all of a sudden starts to play with the nutritional value of the seed.
[48:25.000 --> 48:35.000]  And that's one of our major selling features is that high protein, very good, you know, omega-3, omega-6, omega-9 portfolios.
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  Okay, so next question, kind of a two-part question.
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  Cindy asks, your slide said no clone purchases at this time.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  Is it illegal to sell hemp plants in Canada?
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  And Bill asks, you said no clones approved.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  At Ayasco, we certified the first CBD clone, Unicorn.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  Could our certified clone be approved in Canada?
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  Yeah, we're working on it in Canada.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  So that's exactly what we need is to bridge that data.
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  So that was the thing.
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  So I think, you know, utilizing the likes of the potato industry with a tuber, it's just, you know, there has to be a certification there.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  So it's just, it was not in Canada yet.
[49:18.000 --> 49:30.000]  It doesn't mean that you couldn't have your own greenhouse, start the plants there and transplant, but the sale of clones, although happened and happens, is, you know, under the regulations, not, not legal, I guess.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  Manuel Lopez says, our farm is in a tropical location.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  How will that impact the plant cycles?
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  That's a very good question.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  And I mean, you know, obviously there's genetics from there.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  They're likely more backgrounded in marijuana, I'm guessing.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  But on a photo period plant, that's the thing.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  I predict if we sent, if we sent our variety CRS1 to you, it would grow probably two to three inches, start flowering and that would be it.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  It just, there just is not that day length difference that it can adapt to.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  So auto flower would be an option.
[50:09.000 --> 50:22.000]  And like I said, there's thousands and thousands of genetics or this is a plant that's the most, the most uniform thing about hemp is that it's non-uniform.
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.000]  Like it's extremely difficult to, you know, to certify a crop and the pollen flow is so prolific.
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  You know, it's just, it's a challenge to keep varieties pure.
[50:35.000 --> 50:44.000]  So from my knowledge, like at least for our varieties, that's the impact it would have would be basically just a plant that tall.
[50:45.000 --> 50:53.000]  Lamar asks what US registry exists or is being developed for pre-approved green and or fiber varieties?
[50:54.000 --> 51:01.000]  I mean, there's, this is the tricky part about the US because it, you know, I'll say that each of your states seems to be a country in its own.
[51:01.000 --> 51:07.000]  And so there's different, you know, Colorado has a certification, but that's just for Colorado.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  No, it's not just for Colorado. They can put the Colorado certification on there.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  And it almost sounds like the Colorado Seed Growers Association is all the same as the Canadian Seed Growers Association.
[51:17.000 --> 51:25.000]  But that, all they do there is look at the THC content where the Ayahuasca certification is third party inspected.
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.000]  So the breeder has to say, okay, this variety has to look distinctly different from this variety with these traits or aspects.
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  So that's the uniformity part of it. So a certain percentage can fall outside of that.
[51:39.000 --> 51:45.000]  So if you had a dioecious crop predominantly and you had a hermaphrodite in there, that's where you start to get that cross-pollination.
[51:46.000 --> 51:53.000]  You're only allowed so much of that. So Ayahuasca, OECD are the two that are sort of world recognized, I guess.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  And Ayahuasca is really the North American one.
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.000]  So there are some of the hemp companies in the U.S. are going down that same route, even on the CBD side.
[52:04.000 --> 52:12.000]  Arcadia Bioscience, Jeremy Klecky up in Oregon, they also go with Ayahuasca certification.
[52:13.000 --> 52:19.000]  It's not mandatory, but I, yeah, I guess I think it's a good thing.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  Awesome. Babu has another question.
[52:24.000 --> 52:33.000]  Have you noticed differences in herd filling in the fiber hemp stock? Any suggestion? We found some varieties with hollow insides.
[52:34.000 --> 52:46.000]  Yeah, that's a lot of that's varietal, could be moisture also. Again, it's a great research project, Babu, but seeding rate, seeding density, I guess, seeding date and varietal.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  I would say those are the three things that you want to take a look there.
[52:50.000 --> 53:01.000]  But you're absolutely right. I think seeding density, like to get the most amount of fiber off an acre of crop, you want your stock to be pencil thin.
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  Like this is, again, the best fiber gives you the highest quality best fiber.
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  I'm not necessarily sure on herd. I think you can probably reduce that to grow more herd within that.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  But there's got to be a point in there where there's a trade off.
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.000]  So again, that's another great, the herd was really just a byproduct.
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  It was what the heck are we going to do with the herd once we got all this best fiber?
[53:23.000 --> 53:38.000]  Now, it's the exact opposite to a degree where herd has a pretty good value right now for bedding and everything else in hempcrete, where the best fiber, we don't just don't have the processing in North America to scale to make that.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  And then anytime we're shipping bales, it's always an issue.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  Awesome. Thank you for that.
[53:44.000 --> 53:54.000]  Jarius asks, does the THC level fluctuate throughout the growing process of hemp? And if so, how do you maintain the 0.3% THC level?
[53:54.000 --> 54:03.000]  So there is a technical manual that the Health Canada puts out for when you are supposed to test for THC in these crops.
[54:04.000 --> 54:14.000]  So basically, in a nutshell, it's when 50% of the seeds, so obviously a grain crop or a fiber crop, when 50% of the seeds resist compression is the time that they suggest that you take.
[54:14.000 --> 54:27.000]  So I know the difference in the US where you continually take THC testing until you get to a point where you know that 20 days later you have to harvest and you know that if I can wait until here, then I still fall within regulation.
[54:28.000 --> 54:42.000]  In Canada, it's not. So it's grown. There's a certain physiological time when you have to test on a feminized plant and also on a grain plant. So yes, it will fluctuate. I've seen it fluctuate after yield.
[54:42.000 --> 54:55.000]  I mean, again, the non-uniformity part, the heterozygous aspect of hemp, you can test one hemp plant and it changes within the structure of the plant too.
[54:55.000 --> 55:03.000]  So the top two or three inches has a higher CBD or chamomile content than the bottom leaves.
[55:04.000 --> 55:10.000]  We call those the sugar leaves and the fan leaves. So there's differences not only...
[55:10.000 --> 55:27.000]  There's just differences. Varietal, environmental, fertility. If it's under stress, it seems to me, I know Larry will probably argue with me, a lot of it is genetic and it doesn't change but that's what we all have to talk over a beer sometimes.
[55:27.000 --> 55:40.000]  So one of the leading researchers on this question is sitting in this Zoom call. I don't know if George wants to chime in or not, but he wrote an awesome paper about this question.
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  Probably too hard to summarize in five minutes.
[55:45.000 --> 55:52.000]  Yeah, I mean my study was mostly focused on high CBD varieties, and obviously it's very variety specific.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  So there is definitely a genetic component and then there's an environmental component to total cannabinoid content.
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  And every variety is different, so you have to be familiar with what you're growing, just as Jeff said.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  Thanks, George. I've been following your work there for sure.
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  We kind of met a couple years ago there. Yeah, perfect. Thanks.
[56:11.000 --> 56:28.000]  Awesome. We have one final question. I believe this is Ernie from Alabama A&M. He says, since you do not test for THC at farm production, can we rely on your genetics for the 0.03 level that is enforced at farm production in the US?
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  I can confidently say that for three of our varieties for sure.
[56:33.000 --> 56:41.000]  Our C variety, CRS1, which is the ones that do better in the US anyway. I mean, we've tested them for just about 20 years.
[56:41.000 --> 56:47.000]  They were actually taken off the list to even have to test and then Health Canada changed it again.
[56:47.000 --> 56:53.000]  So it's just they are so stable. They're just so low in THC. They just do not go over.
[56:53.000 --> 57:10.000]  Unless you do something completely, some sort of a, you know, spray or, you know, there are tricks or things that other growers use to enhance THC and CBD. If it's grown in a commercial, you would not have to worry.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Awesome.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  Thank you.
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.000]  I guess we do have time for one more question. This might be more towards for you, Zach.
[57:18.000 --> 57:27.000]  Cindy Cooper asks, is anybody working to get hemp designated as a USDA specialty crop that will open access to millions of research dollars?
[57:27.000 --> 57:38.000]  I do not know the answer to that question, honestly. I think it's a very valid question. I'm a little bit upstream of that right now.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  George, do you know?
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.000]  I have not heard of anybody doing that, but I wouldn't be surprised if somebody is working on it.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Awesome.
[57:49.000 --> 58:02.000]  Well, I believe that is, we're at time. I'm sorry if I didn't get to your question, but if I did not get to your question, please reach out to Jeff with the email he provided.
[58:02.000 --> 58:13.000]  I want to say, join us again in two weeks, where we'll have Dr. Bruce Bugbeat of Utah State University talking about indoor cultivation.
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.000]  So I really look forward to that talk. And thank you all for joining this talk.
[58:17.000 --> 58:23.000]  Thank you so much. This is, yeah, just looking at the participants, that's been one of the highest participant level that I've spoke to in some time.
[58:24.000 --> 58:31.000]  If anybody happens to be going to the World Ag Expo in California, we're going to have a booth there. So drop in and say hi.
[58:31.000 --> 58:38.000]  It's one of my first trips after this big COVID lockdown. So yeah, looking forward to stretching the legs a little.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  So thank you very much for the opportunity to Tony, Zach and George. Really appreciate it.
[58:42.000 --> 58:49.000]  And again, anything else we can do to collaborate with any of the other research institutes, I'm all for it.
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  As I said, that's my bread and butter. So I think it's a huge value for the industry.
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  Awesome. You're getting a lot of thank yous.
[59:07.720 --> 59:13.720]  This has been a production of Cornell University on the web at cornell.edu.
