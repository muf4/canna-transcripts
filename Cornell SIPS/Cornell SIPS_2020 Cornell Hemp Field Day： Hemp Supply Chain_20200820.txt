[00:01.470 --> 00:06.870]  Hi, my name is Lindsay Pascho and I'm on Cornell Cooperative Extension's Harvest
[00:06.870 --> 00:10.670]  New York team. I will be discussing the supply chain for industrial hemp in New
[00:10.670 --> 00:15.590]  York State with discussions about state of processors, a little bit about
[00:15.590 --> 00:27.160]  retailers and consumers. In May 2020, a survey was sent out to the hemp
[00:27.160 --> 00:33.600]  processors in New York State to find out what the state of hemp processing
[00:33.600 --> 00:39.520]  happened in 2019. Out of a little over a hundred processors in New York State,
[00:39.520 --> 00:46.140]  only 24 responded. 13 said that they did process hemp in New York State and 11
[00:46.140 --> 00:54.800]  said that they did not. We asked how much hemp did you process in 2019. 11
[00:54.800 --> 01:02.000]  respondents did not process any hemp and then the hemp range between 0 and
[01:02.000 --> 01:10.440]  8,278 pounds with a total of 122,088 pounds processed in New York State
[01:10.440 --> 01:23.760]  according to the respondents. In 2019, we asked what the minimum CBD content that
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.000]  hemp processors required from their growers. It ranged anywhere from 0 to 12%
[01:30.000 --> 01:42.280]  of CBD percentage they would like from growers. Then we asked processors what
[01:42.280 --> 01:49.120]  they were processing hemp into. This included hemp oil, seed cake, biofuel,
[01:49.120 --> 01:55.800]  plastic raw materials, hemp fiber, pellets and that was for pellet stoves,
[01:55.800 --> 02:12.580]  extracts such as powders, base oil, protein, tinctures, flour and CBD. In 2020,
[02:12.580 --> 02:18.620]  we wanted to know what processors were looking at for their capacity for
[02:18.620 --> 02:24.580]  processing hemp. The range is kind of all off the board but
[02:24.580 --> 02:32.420]  included weekly basis of 200 pounds. Some processors said for a month they
[02:32.420 --> 02:36.820]  could only do about two acres or anywhere between a thousand and a
[02:36.820 --> 02:42.700]  hundred and forty thousand pounds with also some processors responding that
[02:42.700 --> 02:52.280]  they could do anywhere from six thousand to a million pounds within the year.
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.680]  There's not a lot of information out there in New York State about the state
[02:56.680 --> 03:02.360]  of retailers and consumers. This will probably be potentially a future survey
[03:02.360 --> 03:08.000]  to find out from retailers and consumers where the industry is. There's a lot of
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.280]  predictions online about how retail stores might end up closing because of
[03:15.280 --> 03:22.080]  COVID-19. A lot of people can buy CBD locally or they can buy it
[03:22.080 --> 03:28.920]  online. The retail side is very unpredictable and so is on the consumer
[03:28.920 --> 03:36.280]  side. There's large predictions that CBD consumption will continue to increase
[03:36.320 --> 03:45.440]  between 2020 and 2024. If you have any other questions about hemp processors in
[03:45.440 --> 03:50.520]  New York State, please feel free to reach out to me. My email address is
