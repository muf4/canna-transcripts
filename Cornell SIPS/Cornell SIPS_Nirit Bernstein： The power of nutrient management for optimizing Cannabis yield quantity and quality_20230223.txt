[00:00.000 --> 00:02.560]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.710 --> 00:11.070]  Welcome to the 2023 WIHAM Webinar Series.
[00:11.070 --> 00:12.230]  My name is Felipe Monserrate.
[00:12.230 --> 00:15.230]  I'm a second year PhD student in plant breeding and genetics
[00:15.230 --> 00:18.210]  in Larry Smarts Lab at Cornell University.
[00:18.210 --> 00:21.470]  Once again, accompanied by Tony Baracco, a current alum
[00:21.470 --> 00:24.230]  who has assisted me in this webinar series
[00:24.230 --> 00:27.390]  and put it together in all planning and logistics.
[00:27.390 --> 00:29.950]  And lastly, I just want to mention that
[00:29.950 --> 00:32.390]  this webinar series is a component of a larger project
[00:32.390 --> 00:34.990]  which is the development of educational modules
[00:34.990 --> 00:38.230]  that will be freely available on the Cornell HEMP website
[00:38.230 --> 00:40.070]  at the end of the webinar series.
[00:40.070 --> 00:42.430]  In each module, we'll have a recorded webinar,
[00:42.430 --> 00:45.150]  an instructional slide deck with teaching a style
[00:45.150 --> 00:47.550]  of the subject and a set of high impact papers
[00:47.550 --> 00:49.510]  pertaining to the respective subject.
[00:50.710 --> 00:53.430]  All the webinars, this one as well as the future ones
[00:53.430 --> 00:55.150]  and the past ones will be available
[00:55.150 --> 00:57.150]  on the Cornell SIPS YouTube channel
[00:57.150 --> 00:58.750]  if you're interested in re-watching them
[00:58.750 --> 01:01.270]  or sharing them with someone that couldn't attend.
[01:02.630 --> 01:04.670]  So with that, I would like to introduce our speaker.
[01:04.670 --> 01:06.910]  Today's speaker is Dr. Nereid Bernstein.
[01:06.910 --> 01:08.550]  She's a senior research scientist,
[01:08.550 --> 01:11.150]  head of the Cannabis Physiology and Agronomy Lab
[01:11.150 --> 01:12.870]  at Volcani Center in Israel.
[01:12.870 --> 01:15.150]  I had the pleasure to meet her
[01:15.150 --> 01:18.910]  and go over with her a little bit at the SHS conferences.
[01:18.910 --> 01:22.710]  So it is very pleasant to have her here.
[01:22.710 --> 01:26.510]  The topic of her talk today is Nutrient Management
[01:26.510 --> 01:31.150]  for Optimized Production of Secondary Metabolizing Cannabis.
[01:31.190 --> 01:33.390]  I believe she has tweaked her title a little bit,
[01:33.390 --> 01:38.390]  but so without further ado, please Dr. Bernstein take it away.
[01:40.270 --> 01:41.710]  Thank you, thank you, Luis,
[01:41.710 --> 01:45.390]  and welcome whoever joined us for the webinar today.
[01:46.510 --> 01:48.590]  I will show you today some of our results
[01:48.590 --> 01:53.510]  concerning nutrient management for cannabis.
[01:53.510 --> 01:56.190]  Looking of course, on one hand at production,
[01:56.190 --> 01:59.550]  quantity and on the other hand in quality,
[01:59.590 --> 02:02.150]  which is critically as we know in cannabis.
[02:03.190 --> 02:05.270]  So first of all, just to explain
[02:05.270 --> 02:09.670]  why we need to do all this basic studies, basic work,
[02:09.670 --> 02:11.390]  is because since we, I mean,
[02:11.390 --> 02:13.710]  we know that cannabis is not a new crop.
[02:13.710 --> 02:15.390]  We know that it's a very ancient crop,
[02:15.390 --> 02:17.310]  probably one among the first crops
[02:17.310 --> 02:19.190]  that humanity has been used.
[02:19.190 --> 02:21.510]  And we know that it's been used for medical use.
[02:21.510 --> 02:24.390]  And because of this, it has a religious importance
[02:24.390 --> 02:27.550]  for recreation and a lot for commercial value.
[02:27.550 --> 02:29.550]  So it's been used forever.
[02:29.550 --> 02:30.590]  And then what happened?
[02:30.590 --> 02:32.830]  What happened, and this actually is important
[02:32.830 --> 02:34.870]  why we need to deal with it,
[02:34.870 --> 02:38.470]  with the research on all type of level,
[02:38.470 --> 02:40.150]  is that in 1961,
[02:40.150 --> 02:43.590]  there was an international single convection
[02:43.590 --> 02:45.430]  that was signed on narcotic drugs.
[02:45.430 --> 02:50.230]  And basically at that time, from this minute, from 1961,
[02:50.230 --> 02:53.230]  all research on cannabis stopped.
[02:53.230 --> 02:56.870]  So because cannabis was declared as a narcotic substance,
[02:56.910 --> 02:59.390]  not registered anymore as a medical product,
[02:59.390 --> 03:03.670]  definitely not allowed for recreational adult use.
[03:03.670 --> 03:04.990]  And when we think about it,
[03:04.990 --> 03:07.390]  and now it comes to why this is important to understand,
[03:07.390 --> 03:08.630]  when we think about this,
[03:09.470 --> 03:12.070]  basically the knowledge that we had on cannabis,
[03:12.070 --> 03:13.470]  maybe it was from the 50s.
[03:13.470 --> 03:16.270]  But when we think about cultivation and agronomy
[03:16.270 --> 03:18.390]  and plant science in the 50s,
[03:18.390 --> 03:19.950]  compared to what it is today,
[03:19.950 --> 03:21.910]  obviously there was a huge gap.
[03:21.910 --> 03:24.110]  So in order to bring this,
[03:24.710 --> 03:29.710]  once the recent changes that occur in regulation,
[03:30.910 --> 03:34.150]  and cannabis is gaining in many parts of the world now,
[03:34.150 --> 03:38.390]  a certain level of legal crop,
[03:38.390 --> 03:41.190]  either for medical, for recreation, or for both.
[03:42.550 --> 03:47.550]  And all of a sudden, from this illegal marijuana type crop,
[03:47.990 --> 03:50.950]  it has to be a modern cultivar,
[03:50.950 --> 03:54.230]  either for medical or for recreational use.
[03:54.230 --> 03:56.870]  And the level of knowledge that we had,
[03:56.870 --> 03:58.790]  maybe about eight or nine years ago,
[03:58.790 --> 04:01.870]  was almost zero on this crop.
[04:03.230 --> 04:05.950]  So therefore there's a need to develop
[04:05.950 --> 04:08.870]  innovative aquacultivation technologies
[04:08.870 --> 04:12.310]  to support the booming cannabis industry.
[04:12.310 --> 04:15.430]  And really I have to say that when we think of the level
[04:15.430 --> 04:19.310]  of agronomic knowledge that we need to have about cannabis,
[04:19.310 --> 04:22.590]  it's a challenge that I think that we've never faced
[04:22.590 --> 04:25.830]  with any other cultivar, any other crop before.
[04:25.830 --> 04:28.790]  Because we're not only dealing with being able
[04:28.790 --> 04:32.430]  to produce sufficient yield quantity for the growers,
[04:32.430 --> 04:35.910]  we're not only dealing with sufficient taste for the users,
[04:35.910 --> 04:38.710]  we're dealing with something that has to be standardized
[04:38.710 --> 04:42.630]  because it's used as a medical crop.
[04:42.630 --> 04:45.510]  And if not for medical use, also for recreation,
[04:45.510 --> 04:47.590]  or for life quality,
[04:47.590 --> 04:49.430]  the level of the secondary metabolites
[04:49.430 --> 04:53.110]  that has biological activity needs to be standardized.
[04:53.110 --> 04:54.510]  And this have never happened before.
[04:54.510 --> 04:57.310]  When we compare it to growing tomatoes or growing apples,
[04:57.310 --> 04:58.510]  I mean, it doesn't really matter
[04:58.510 --> 05:01.270]  if one side of the tomato is more red than the other.
[05:01.270 --> 05:03.230]  That means that it has more lycopene than the other,
[05:03.230 --> 05:05.750]  because eventually everything's going to be chopped up
[05:05.750 --> 05:07.870]  into a salad or into a ketchup.
[05:07.870 --> 05:10.550]  It's not being consumed as medicine.
[05:10.550 --> 05:12.790]  And therefore we're coming from a crop
[05:12.790 --> 05:14.790]  that has very, very little,
[05:14.790 --> 05:18.550]  or we had until seven or eight or nine years ago,
[05:18.550 --> 05:22.590]  we had basically no agronomic knowledge about,
[05:22.590 --> 05:24.630]  into something that we now have to increase
[05:24.630 --> 05:28.750]  to close the plant science agronomy gap very, very quickly
[05:28.750 --> 05:32.270]  in order to prepare it and prepare it to be used
[05:32.270 --> 05:33.390]  as a modern crop.
[05:34.350 --> 05:37.710]  So since there are challenges, there are still challenges
[05:37.710 --> 05:39.630]  and there are breakthroughs,
[05:39.630 --> 05:42.270]  I have to say that I was, because Israel was,
[05:42.270 --> 05:45.030]  I think the first country that legalized
[05:45.030 --> 05:47.310]  at least medical and recreational use
[05:47.310 --> 05:50.790]  following the 1961 convention.
[05:50.790 --> 05:53.390]  And I was approached at that time by the ministry of health
[05:53.390 --> 05:54.510]  and the ministry of agriculture.
[05:54.510 --> 05:56.790]  And I was the first scientist in Israel to be licensed
[05:56.790 --> 05:58.150]  to work with the crop.
[05:58.150 --> 06:01.230]  And many people say, possibly even in the world,
[06:01.230 --> 06:03.590]  I don't know, but at that time,
[06:03.590 --> 06:05.550]  there was so many questions that were coming,
[06:05.550 --> 06:08.710]  from growers in Israel, growers in the world.
[06:08.710 --> 06:11.150]  And it was difficult to decide what to work on.
[06:11.150 --> 06:13.110]  Of course, we started working on nutrition
[06:13.110 --> 06:15.790]  because this is the fundamental things for growing.
[06:15.790 --> 06:19.830]  So what I just want to say that project in the lab ever since
[06:19.830 --> 06:23.070]  and today cover in our lab cover
[06:23.070 --> 06:25.750]  a large area of research topic.
[06:25.750 --> 06:26.870]  Most of them, first of all,
[06:26.870 --> 06:29.710]  centers on optimization of field quantity
[06:29.710 --> 06:34.470]  and chemical quality of the product
[06:35.750 --> 06:37.710]  in terms of working on fertilization,
[06:37.710 --> 06:40.790]  light quality and intensity, plant architecture,
[06:41.430 --> 06:42.270]  training and so on,
[06:42.270 --> 06:44.110]  temperature, humidity, and many other things.
[06:44.110 --> 06:47.550]  So there I'll be showing data on fertilization.
[06:47.550 --> 06:50.070]  Everything geared for chemical standardization
[06:50.070 --> 06:55.070]  and optimization of wanted secondary metabolites.
[06:56.190 --> 06:57.950]  Critical issue that you're working on
[06:57.950 --> 07:01.150]  is prevention of contamination, microbial contamination,
[07:01.150 --> 07:03.030]  heavy metal contamination,
[07:03.030 --> 07:06.470]  pesticide that so little information is known about.
[07:07.390 --> 07:08.670]  Post-harvest practices,
[07:08.710 --> 07:11.470]  so the minute that we cut it,
[07:11.470 --> 07:16.470]  how does the degradation of the secondary metabolite
[07:16.470 --> 07:19.310]  and what's the connection between cultivation practices
[07:19.310 --> 07:22.030]  and post-harvest qualities
[07:22.030 --> 07:25.310]  and many other issues also related to medical
[07:25.310 --> 07:27.110]  that of course we will not be covering today.
[07:27.110 --> 07:29.510]  So today, as Luis said,
[07:29.510 --> 07:32.950]  I'm going to talk about optimization of fertilization
[07:33.870 --> 07:36.430]  or fertilizers for increased
[07:36.430 --> 07:38.030]  secondary metabolite production.
[07:38.390 --> 07:41.270]  Of course, not neglecting also the quantity issue
[07:41.270 --> 07:42.550]  of the yield.
[07:42.550 --> 07:44.910]  So it's plant development and biomass production
[07:44.910 --> 07:49.550]  versus or joined with quality chemical quantity.
[07:50.750 --> 07:53.310]  So that means that we need to affect plant performance.
[07:53.310 --> 07:56.750]  So how do we affect plant performance?
[07:56.750 --> 07:58.990]  It's very basic agronomic question
[07:58.990 --> 08:00.710]  which tends to be very complicated
[08:00.710 --> 08:04.270]  when we are hitting cannabis cultivation.
[08:04.270 --> 08:07.030]  But overall, we know that environmental conditions
[08:07.030 --> 08:10.950]  and cultivation conditions affect plant development
[08:10.950 --> 08:12.630]  and plant function.
[08:12.630 --> 08:14.510]  So plant development and plant growth,
[08:14.510 --> 08:17.590]  that means that it affects yield quantity.
[08:17.590 --> 08:19.030]  On the other hand, of course,
[08:19.030 --> 08:21.910]  environmental condition and cultivation conditions
[08:21.910 --> 08:25.230]  also affect not only primary metabolism in the plant,
[08:25.230 --> 08:29.390]  also secondary metabolism and the yield quantity,
[08:31.110 --> 08:32.950]  yield quality, of course, not quantity.
[08:32.950 --> 08:35.630]  Yield quality in cannabis is of course,
[08:35.630 --> 08:39.510]  based on production of the secondary metabolites.
[08:39.510 --> 08:42.310]  And of course, there's interaction between the two
[08:42.310 --> 08:45.150]  because the secondary primary metabolism
[08:45.150 --> 08:47.390]  and yield plant development
[08:47.390 --> 08:50.190]  affect very much secondary metabolism
[08:50.190 --> 08:52.550]  and the quality of the yield.
[08:52.550 --> 08:55.230]  So there are already data,
[08:55.230 --> 08:58.230]  already we do from our lab, some other labs as well,
[08:58.230 --> 09:01.190]  that shows that light affects secondary metabolism
[09:01.190 --> 09:03.670]  and temperature and stress conditions.
[09:03.710 --> 09:05.390]  And today we will be focusing
[09:05.390 --> 09:07.550]  on effects of mineral nutrition.
[09:08.750 --> 09:13.750]  So if we briefly mention secondary metabolism
[09:14.270 --> 09:18.710]  and hopefully by now, I mean, it's very well known.
[09:18.710 --> 09:20.590]  We have more than a thousand
[09:20.590 --> 09:23.510]  known biologically active compounds in cannabis,
[09:23.510 --> 09:25.710]  a thousand, it's a huge number.
[09:25.710 --> 09:29.070]  And they're divided into several chemical groups.
[09:29.070 --> 09:32.670]  The three most, the largest one are cannabinoids,
[09:32.670 --> 09:34.230]  which are specific for cannabis
[09:34.230 --> 09:35.710]  or almost specific for cannabis,
[09:35.710 --> 09:37.230]  and then terpenes and flavonoids,
[09:37.230 --> 09:39.510]  which exist also in other plants.
[09:39.510 --> 09:42.430]  And of course, because we have interactions between them,
[09:42.430 --> 09:46.030]  the entourage effect on the biological activity,
[09:46.030 --> 09:48.230]  whatever agricultural production we will do,
[09:48.230 --> 09:50.270]  if we are thinking about the chemical quality,
[09:50.270 --> 09:53.550]  we cannot ignore compounds other than,
[09:53.550 --> 09:56.470]  cannot grow other compounds than cannabis.
[09:56.470 --> 09:59.670]  And these of course are affected by two things.
[09:59.670 --> 10:00.910]  So one hand genetics,
[10:00.910 --> 10:03.310]  so different strains have different potential
[10:03.310 --> 10:06.270]  for production, but this is only the potential,
[10:06.270 --> 10:08.230]  whether what will be produced
[10:08.230 --> 10:10.550]  and to what qualities secondary metabolites
[10:10.550 --> 10:15.070]  will be produced depending on cultivation condition,
[10:15.070 --> 10:16.350]  on the cultivation condition.
[10:16.350 --> 10:18.190]  And therefore the actual production
[10:18.190 --> 10:20.190]  is dependent on the cultivation condition
[10:20.190 --> 10:24.350]  and mineral nutrition has a large part of it.
[10:25.310 --> 10:27.750]  So when we started to work on mineral nutrition
[10:27.750 --> 10:30.910]  after doing a few studies in the greenhouse,
[10:30.910 --> 10:32.710]  we decided that we have to go back
[10:32.710 --> 10:34.790]  to what's known for many plants
[10:34.790 --> 10:38.590]  since maybe the seventies or the eighties or before that,
[10:38.590 --> 10:41.390]  and to know how much nutrients does the plant take?
[10:41.390 --> 10:46.390]  How does the cannabis plant respond to nutrients?
[10:46.750 --> 10:47.670]  How much do they need
[10:47.670 --> 10:49.430]  in the first or second week of cultivation?
[10:49.430 --> 10:52.510]  What's the difference between how the amount that they need
[10:52.510 --> 10:55.390]  in vegetative stage of development
[10:55.390 --> 10:57.670]  versus reproductive stage of development?
[10:58.470 --> 10:59.310]  So in order to understand the plant
[10:59.310 --> 11:01.070]  and to see what the plant is taking
[11:01.070 --> 11:03.550]  and how does the amount of nutrient
[11:03.550 --> 11:07.270]  that is available to the plant affect the production,
[11:07.270 --> 11:11.430]  we had to go into classical mineral nutrition studies,
[11:11.430 --> 11:15.910]  which are done in soil-less cultivation.
[11:15.910 --> 11:17.430]  So this will be in pots,
[11:17.430 --> 11:20.110]  in mostly in a semi-controlled
[11:20.110 --> 11:24.470]  or controlled environmental condition
[11:24.470 --> 11:25.830]  where everything is regulated.
[11:25.830 --> 11:26.910]  How much we give the plant,
[11:26.950 --> 11:29.590]  what leach below the plant,
[11:29.590 --> 11:30.870]  what remains in the plant,
[11:30.870 --> 11:31.950]  how much do we have,
[11:31.950 --> 11:34.630]  each of those micro and macronutrients,
[11:34.630 --> 11:36.310]  how much do we have in the leaf and in the flowers
[11:36.310 --> 11:38.070]  and in the stems and in the root
[11:38.070 --> 11:39.910]  so we can understand and close the balance
[11:39.910 --> 11:43.030]  and then know how does the plant will respond to this.
[11:43.030 --> 11:45.710]  So most of the studies that I will show today,
[11:45.710 --> 11:47.430]  unless I'll tell something else,
[11:47.430 --> 11:49.030]  were conducted for this reason,
[11:49.030 --> 11:52.030]  as is very customary for classical mineral
[11:52.030 --> 11:53.790]  in nutrition studies
[11:53.790 --> 11:57.470]  that aimed understanding the uptake of the plant.
[11:57.470 --> 12:00.310]  It will be conducted in soil-less cultivation,
[12:00.310 --> 12:05.110]  in pots, in controlled growing rooms.
[12:06.830 --> 12:09.870]  So one of the first thing that we did is that,
[12:09.870 --> 12:12.030]  this was probably seven years ago,
[12:12.030 --> 12:13.630]  so six years ago,
[12:13.630 --> 12:15.830]  no one at the time had an idea,
[12:15.830 --> 12:18.270]  but you know what this plant is doing.
[12:18.270 --> 12:19.270]  So we checked,
[12:19.270 --> 12:21.110]  and this I wanna show you,
[12:21.110 --> 12:22.150]  we actually discovered
[12:22.150 --> 12:23.990]  that there's an issue with standardization
[12:23.990 --> 12:27.070]  at the time before that no one was actually aware of this.
[12:27.070 --> 12:28.350]  So we took a plant,
[12:28.350 --> 12:29.510]  and a plant, I mean,
[12:29.510 --> 12:31.350]  a very controlled experiment
[12:31.350 --> 12:33.310]  in which we did several treatments,
[12:33.310 --> 12:34.750]  but we checked concentration
[12:34.750 --> 12:37.790]  of the cannabinoids and terpenoids and flavonoids
[12:37.790 --> 12:38.790]  at the top of the plant,
[12:38.790 --> 12:41.310]  center of the plant and bottom of the plant,
[12:41.310 --> 12:42.750]  maybe primary in fluorescent,
[12:42.750 --> 12:43.950]  secondary in fluorescent
[12:43.950 --> 12:46.670]  and tertiary, the order in fluorescent.
[12:46.670 --> 12:49.310]  And I wanna show you some brief, just data.
[12:49.310 --> 12:50.510]  So if you look at, for example,
[12:50.550 --> 12:52.750]  the THC from the bottom of the plant,
[12:52.750 --> 12:54.430]  center of the plant and top of the plant,
[12:54.430 --> 12:56.630]  we see obviously that at the top of the plant
[12:56.630 --> 12:58.030]  there is much higher concentration,
[12:58.030 --> 13:00.070]  so there's variability.
[13:00.070 --> 13:01.950]  The same thing we can see for CBD,
[13:01.950 --> 13:04.270]  the same thing we can see for CBG
[13:04.270 --> 13:06.030]  and the opposite trend for CBN.
[13:06.030 --> 13:07.630]  This told us at the time,
[13:07.630 --> 13:09.510]  there's an issue with standardization
[13:09.510 --> 13:10.630]  and it's very critical
[13:10.630 --> 13:12.310]  because this is the medication
[13:12.310 --> 13:13.910]  that patients are taking.
[13:13.910 --> 13:18.710]  So if the patients are taking 12% versus 6%,
[13:18.710 --> 13:21.150]  it's like taking one aspirin or two aspirin
[13:21.150 --> 13:23.870]  or two antibiotics or one antibiotics in one time.
[13:23.870 --> 13:25.710]  So this standardization is critical
[13:25.710 --> 13:29.190]  because whatever the consumer is going to consume
[13:29.190 --> 13:31.350]  needs to be obviously standardized.
[13:31.350 --> 13:33.630]  And the big question now was,
[13:33.630 --> 13:37.190]  how does environmental condition
[13:37.190 --> 13:38.950]  combined with this, interacts with this?
[13:38.950 --> 13:43.310]  Does environment, does nutrition has affects this?
[13:43.310 --> 13:45.230]  And there was no information at the time.
[13:45.230 --> 13:47.870]  So this is the one of the initial studies that we did.
[13:47.870 --> 13:49.310]  This was done by a master's student
[13:49.310 --> 13:52.110]  in the lab at the time, Sariya Koch.
[13:52.110 --> 13:54.790]  And we checked commercial fertilization
[13:54.790 --> 13:57.910]  versus addition of 20% phosphorus
[13:57.910 --> 14:01.430]  or addition of NPNK together or humic acid.
[14:01.430 --> 14:02.270]  Why humic acid?
[14:02.270 --> 14:03.990]  Because everyone at the time was saying
[14:03.990 --> 14:06.590]  that humic acid can improve THC production
[14:06.590 --> 14:08.750]  and CBD production and it's great.
[14:08.750 --> 14:10.470]  So we thought we'll try it.
[14:10.470 --> 14:12.670]  And what we found out, which was great,
[14:12.670 --> 14:15.030]  I mean, it was a breakthrough at the time,
[14:15.030 --> 14:16.950]  to see that actually mineral nutrition
[14:16.950 --> 14:20.710]  have a huge effect on secondary metabolite production
[14:20.710 --> 14:21.670]  in the plant.
[14:21.670 --> 14:24.990]  For example, if we look at, let's look at what?
[14:24.990 --> 14:26.990]  Let's look at THC, for example.
[14:26.990 --> 14:29.350]  We see that humic acid actually reduced
[14:29.350 --> 14:32.670]  greatly production of THC.
[14:32.670 --> 14:37.670]  Addition of NPNK increased production of CBD
[14:37.790 --> 14:41.750]  and CBD was also reduced by humic acid.
[14:41.750 --> 14:43.310]  Meaning, let's not discuss right now
[14:43.310 --> 14:44.830]  what type of humic acid it is.
[14:44.830 --> 14:46.830]  I'm glad that's the topic for a different discussion,
[14:47.710 --> 14:50.270]  but what this told us is there is a huge potential
[14:50.270 --> 14:52.870]  for mineral nutrition and for supplements
[14:52.870 --> 14:57.870]  to affect the secondary metabolite production.
[14:58.390 --> 15:00.870]  So now we've done the same experiment.
[15:00.870 --> 15:02.230]  This is part of the same experiment.
[15:02.230 --> 15:04.790]  By the way, the data that I'm showing you is all published
[15:04.790 --> 15:06.230]  and you can find it online.
[15:06.230 --> 15:09.910]  In most cases, I put the references on top.
[15:09.910 --> 15:13.070]  This is, of course, all published data.
[15:13.070 --> 15:16.590]  And what we did is now we looked at the same treatments
[15:16.910 --> 15:18.870]  in the commercial treatment plus phosphorus,
[15:18.870 --> 15:20.630]  plus NPK and plus humic acid,
[15:20.630 --> 15:23.190]  of course, in addition to the commercial treatment.
[15:23.190 --> 15:25.470]  And we checked in three different levels on the plant
[15:25.470 --> 15:27.790]  and the bottom sent flowers from the bottom center
[15:27.790 --> 15:28.710]  and top of the plant.
[15:28.710 --> 15:29.630]  And we saw how is that,
[15:29.630 --> 15:33.710]  does it interact with the nutrition?
[15:33.710 --> 15:36.190]  And what we found out, and I just pointed one thing,
[15:36.190 --> 15:38.990]  for example, if we look at the humic acid treatment
[15:38.990 --> 15:43.670]  for Delta 98C, what we can see that all of a sudden
[15:43.670 --> 15:46.070]  the concentration are standardized.
[15:46.070 --> 15:48.390]  So at different location in the plant,
[15:48.390 --> 15:49.870]  we have similar concentration.
[15:49.870 --> 15:51.830]  This was a huge breakthrough.
[15:51.830 --> 15:54.030]  But on the other hand, it was standardized
[15:54.030 --> 15:56.510]  because it reduced the concentration in the top
[15:56.510 --> 15:59.270]  and in the center of the plant to a lower level.
[15:59.270 --> 16:01.230]  So that means it doesn't mean that that's what we want.
[16:01.230 --> 16:05.630]  Obviously we want production of the secondary metabolites
[16:05.630 --> 16:07.550]  that we are interested to increase,
[16:07.550 --> 16:09.590]  but it means that there's a potential
[16:09.590 --> 16:14.590]  for nutrient supplementation to affect also standardization
[16:14.630 --> 16:16.030]  or development in the plant.
[16:17.070 --> 16:20.190]  From now, from this point, we decided, okay, no,
[16:20.190 --> 16:24.350]  zero information about response of the plants,
[16:24.350 --> 16:26.270]  of cannabis plants with different nutrients,
[16:26.270 --> 16:28.190]  zero information at a time for how much
[16:28.190 --> 16:29.710]  the plants actually take up.
[16:29.710 --> 16:33.270]  So we started with a series, I started in the lab,
[16:33.270 --> 16:36.470]  a series of experiments separately
[16:36.470 --> 16:38.710]  for the vegetative growth of the plant
[16:38.710 --> 16:40.550]  and separately for the reproductive growth.
[16:40.550 --> 16:43.030]  Of course, cannabis is a short-lived plant.
[16:43.030 --> 16:46.430]  So under long for the period, it will grow vegetatively.
[16:46.430 --> 16:48.750]  And only when under short for the period,
[16:48.750 --> 16:50.590]  there's induction of flower development
[16:50.590 --> 16:55.030]  in florescent development and reproductive growth.
[16:55.030 --> 16:57.510]  So we've initiated those nutrient, for the first stage,
[16:57.510 --> 17:01.270]  the nutrient studies separately for the vegetative state
[17:01.270 --> 17:04.230]  growth and for the reproductive growth.
[17:04.230 --> 17:08.110]  And I want to show you some of our results.
[17:08.110 --> 17:09.430]  Right now, there's a lot of data,
[17:09.430 --> 17:11.470]  please focus on the image only.
[17:11.470 --> 17:14.190]  And this experiment was a response to nitrogen supply.
[17:14.190 --> 17:19.190]  This was done by Avias Loner, a PhD student in the lab,
[17:19.670 --> 17:20.950]  master's student at the time,
[17:20.950 --> 17:24.230]  is almost finishing his PhD studies now.
[17:24.230 --> 17:26.470]  And we really had no idea where to start with
[17:26.470 --> 17:27.790]  because there was zero information.
[17:27.790 --> 17:31.990]  So we started with a very large range of nitrogens,
[17:31.990 --> 17:36.030]  starting from 30 all the way to 320 milligrams per liter,
[17:36.030 --> 17:37.470]  is PPM.
[17:37.470 --> 17:40.910]  And we can see, so these are the five concentrations
[17:41.350 --> 17:44.670]  that we started as we can see under 30 PPM as expected,
[17:44.670 --> 17:45.950]  this is a very, very low,
[17:45.950 --> 17:48.390]  the plants were small and deficient,
[17:48.390 --> 17:52.710]  slightly better under 80 PPMs, 160 looked okay,
[17:52.710 --> 17:57.710]  so did 240, 320 already suffered from probably toxicity.
[17:58.790 --> 18:01.230]  So we have a classical response curve to nutrients
[18:01.230 --> 18:04.510]  going from deficiency to optimal range of supply
[18:04.510 --> 18:09.510]  to over threshold of optimum, which is towards toxicity.
[18:10.990 --> 18:12.870]  And if we look at the development,
[18:12.870 --> 18:16.950]  and if we look at the numerical value of this,
[18:16.950 --> 18:19.550]  so we look at the plant height and biomass production
[18:19.550 --> 18:21.350]  and so forth, it follows the same thing.
[18:21.350 --> 18:23.670]  So this is leaf fresh biomass,
[18:23.670 --> 18:25.870]  and we can see here the concentration of nitrogen,
[18:25.870 --> 18:28.670]  we can see an increase until an optimum
[18:28.670 --> 18:30.870]  and then a decrease, same thing occurs with stem,
[18:30.870 --> 18:32.550]  with a fresh weight of the stem,
[18:32.550 --> 18:35.870]  the same thing with fresh weight rate of the root.
[18:35.870 --> 18:37.270]  So it's classical response,
[18:37.310 --> 18:41.510]  and we can identify that 160 PPM nitrogen
[18:41.510 --> 18:43.470]  is an optimal range.
[18:43.470 --> 18:45.190]  What happened in terms of concentration,
[18:45.190 --> 18:47.750]  you can, in terms of concentration in the plant,
[18:47.750 --> 18:49.830]  physiological responses, respiration,
[18:49.830 --> 18:52.310]  we did dozens of measurements,
[18:52.310 --> 18:54.310]  you can, oh, I'm not going obviously to show them,
[18:54.310 --> 18:56.990]  you can log into the application if you want
[18:56.990 --> 19:00.590]  and see the plant response, the physiological responses.
[19:00.590 --> 19:03.190]  But overall, we can see that nitrogen accumulation
[19:03.190 --> 19:05.790]  as nitrate in the plant increased
[19:05.790 --> 19:07.430]  with the increase of end supply.
[19:07.430 --> 19:12.430]  So it's a classical plant response to nutrients.
[19:14.030 --> 19:17.470]  What happened in the reproductive stage of growth?
[19:17.470 --> 19:19.470]  So now we are talking about the flowering stage,
[19:19.470 --> 19:23.350]  the same type concentration of nitrogen,
[19:23.350 --> 19:27.390]  we can also see deficiency in 30 and 80 PPMs,
[19:27.390 --> 19:30.550]  we can also see beginning of symptoms
[19:30.550 --> 19:34.270]  of an optimal conditions under 320.
[19:34.270 --> 19:39.030]  And again, the optimum concentration probably is 160,
[19:39.030 --> 19:41.670]  although 240 will probably won't harm it,
[19:41.670 --> 19:43.070]  but it's not needed.
[19:43.070 --> 19:47.070]  So for the sake of economical condition for the farmers,
[19:47.070 --> 19:48.870]  environmental contamination,
[19:48.870 --> 19:52.470]  whether it's better to stick with 160,
[19:52.470 --> 19:55.830]  and we checked it for several varieties.
[19:55.830 --> 19:58.790]  But you know what, this is just biomass production.
[19:58.790 --> 20:00.790]  What happened when we actually went
[20:00.790 --> 20:05.790]  and analyzed concentration of the therapeutic compounds,
[20:06.470 --> 20:08.430]  biologically active secondary metabolites,
[20:08.430 --> 20:11.150]  such as terpenes and such as cannabinoids,
[20:11.150 --> 20:13.750]  actually the best production was actually,
[20:13.750 --> 20:15.350]  the highest production was actually
[20:15.350 --> 20:19.550]  in those sorry looking, hungry, nitrogen starving plants.
[20:19.550 --> 20:22.630]  That's where we received the highest concentration
[20:22.630 --> 20:26.430]  of the highest concentration of those compounds.
[20:26.430 --> 20:27.590]  So here are some examples,
[20:27.590 --> 20:30.710]  you can see many more of them in our publications,
[20:31.510 --> 20:32.590]  but for example, if we look at cannabinoids
[20:32.590 --> 20:35.350]  and we look again at the concentration of the minerals,
[20:35.350 --> 20:38.630]  so THC, CBGA, CBD, CBC,
[20:38.630 --> 20:42.630]  all of them were highest under the deficiency conditions
[20:42.630 --> 20:46.670]  and they're decreased with increased concentration.
[20:46.670 --> 20:48.350]  Same thing for most of the terpenes,
[20:48.350 --> 20:49.870]  most of the terpenes were highest
[20:49.870 --> 20:53.630]  under the low concentration of nitrogen and decreased.
[20:53.630 --> 20:56.510]  Some of them were not affected,
[20:56.510 --> 20:57.550]  but for many of them,
[20:57.550 --> 20:59.390]  and you can again look at the publication,
[20:59.430 --> 21:02.270]  highest concentration were in the hungry plant.
[21:02.270 --> 21:04.270]  So now we're in trouble,
[21:04.270 --> 21:07.310]  are we going to grow those tiny, hungry looking plants?
[21:07.310 --> 21:09.710]  Definitely not, we'll need to find ways
[21:09.710 --> 21:11.030]  and that's what we're working on
[21:11.030 --> 21:12.470]  to trick the plants to think
[21:12.470 --> 21:16.150]  that they're under stress of some kind
[21:16.150 --> 21:17.110]  in order to produce it.
[21:17.110 --> 21:19.590]  This is some of the work that we're working on
[21:19.590 --> 21:21.070]  in the lab today.
[21:21.070 --> 21:23.590]  So that was nitrogen, nitrogen deficiency,
[21:23.590 --> 21:25.350]  best for optimal production.
[21:26.310 --> 21:27.270]  What about potassium?
[21:27.310 --> 21:29.710]  This is again, was done by Avia Salona.
[21:29.710 --> 21:32.990]  So we checked it again, we had no idea where to start.
[21:32.990 --> 21:34.430]  So we had based on knowledge for,
[21:34.430 --> 21:37.310]  acronymical knowledge for a wide range of plants.
[21:37.310 --> 21:40.470]  We checked a concentration from 50 ppm,
[21:40.470 --> 21:41.910]  which obviously was,
[21:41.910 --> 21:45.670]  we were hoping to shoot from deficiency to toxicity.
[21:45.670 --> 21:50.670]  So we tried concentration from 15 to 240 ppm potassium.
[21:52.470 --> 21:56.830]  And again, we can see that the 15 and the 60
[21:57.390 --> 21:59.550]  plants were, it's definitely 15 was deficient,
[21:59.550 --> 22:01.870]  60 was slightly longer.
[22:01.870 --> 22:06.630]  And then between 100 and 175, that was an optimum range,
[22:06.630 --> 22:08.830]  probably saying that 100 is sufficient
[22:08.830 --> 22:13.830]  and there's no need to increase much more than this.
[22:14.270 --> 22:16.350]  So this is for the vegetative phase.
[22:16.350 --> 22:21.350]  What happened at the reproductive phase of growth?
[22:22.110 --> 22:27.110]  So this is again, the same five different concentration
[22:27.150 --> 22:28.870]  of potassium.
[22:30.630 --> 22:33.230]  By the way, I have to make sure that I explained
[22:33.230 --> 22:35.350]  that the irrigation here was done of course,
[22:35.350 --> 22:38.590]  by a fertilization.
[22:38.590 --> 22:41.590]  So that means that the fertilizer were mixed,
[22:41.590 --> 22:43.830]  dissolved in the irrigation water,
[22:43.830 --> 22:48.110]  in the irrigation water and supplied the plant as mixed.
[22:48.230 --> 22:53.230]  And also important to note is that most nutrient studies,
[22:56.310 --> 22:57.550]  mineral nutrition studies,
[22:57.550 --> 23:00.750]  which are aimed into seeing how much the plant takes up,
[23:02.470 --> 23:05.030]  we use perlite as the growing substance
[23:05.030 --> 23:07.590]  because it's a relatively inert medium.
[23:07.590 --> 23:09.470]  So whatever we give in the irrigation,
[23:09.470 --> 23:12.750]  that's what the plant sees during the time of irrigation
[23:12.750 --> 23:13.590]  and later on.
[23:13.590 --> 23:15.870]  So there's very little chemical interaction
[23:15.910 --> 23:19.470]  with the soil-less media.
[23:19.470 --> 23:23.350]  And also we adjust the volume of irrigation
[23:23.350 --> 23:25.430]  in every irrigation event to make sure
[23:25.430 --> 23:29.510]  that we have at least 30%, between 30 and 35% of leachate.
[23:29.510 --> 23:33.790]  So a flow down the pot.
[23:33.790 --> 23:36.790]  By this we ensure that we don't have accumulation,
[23:36.790 --> 23:40.310]  high accumulation of nutrients in the medium.
[23:40.310 --> 23:41.390]  So we leach the medium.
[23:41.390 --> 23:44.510]  And so that means that it keeps the concentration
[23:44.550 --> 23:47.310]  that the root sees rather constant.
[23:48.150 --> 23:49.950]  So going back to potassium.
[23:49.950 --> 23:51.630]  So we're looking at potassium
[23:51.630 --> 23:53.750]  in the reproductive phase of growth,
[23:53.750 --> 23:58.750]  again, from 15 to 240 milligram per liter, it's PPM.
[24:00.750 --> 24:03.030]  And based on visual appearance
[24:03.030 --> 24:05.910]  and based on a lot of biomass measurement
[24:05.910 --> 24:07.550]  and physiological measurements,
[24:07.550 --> 24:09.590]  100 PPM is the optimal range
[24:09.590 --> 24:12.030]  and it's quite sufficient.
[24:12.030 --> 24:14.110]  However, what happened again,
[24:14.710 --> 24:17.310]  when we measured secondary metabolites,
[24:17.310 --> 24:18.750]  cannabinoids and terpenoids,
[24:18.750 --> 24:20.030]  the same thing happens.
[24:20.030 --> 24:22.030]  The highest concentration was actually
[24:22.030 --> 24:24.950]  in the potassium starving plants.
[24:24.950 --> 24:27.270]  So both are potassium and from nitrogen,
[24:27.270 --> 24:30.190]  the best production of secondary metabolites
[24:30.190 --> 24:35.030]  was actually in those small looking hungry plants.
[24:35.030 --> 24:37.390]  So now the grower had to decide,
[24:37.390 --> 24:40.430]  is the shooting for higher concentration
[24:40.430 --> 24:43.190]  or is it shooting for more biomass?
[24:43.190 --> 24:46.590]  And of course, for those growers
[24:46.590 --> 24:48.390]  which don't sell flowers,
[24:48.390 --> 24:51.310]  but they actually do extract,
[24:51.310 --> 24:53.230]  and they are interested in biomass per plant
[24:53.230 --> 24:54.590]  or biomass per meter square,
[24:54.590 --> 24:57.150]  we have all this data in the manuscript
[24:57.150 --> 24:59.990]  and still the same thing occur, obviously.
[25:02.150 --> 25:04.910]  I mean, there were higher concentration,
[25:04.910 --> 25:06.230]  lower and lower this.
[25:06.230 --> 25:07.150]  And for the totals,
[25:07.150 --> 25:09.150]  it's possible to look at the manuscript.
[25:10.150 --> 25:13.150]  Just to show the results again
[25:13.150 --> 25:17.070]  for the secondary metabolite production.
[25:17.070 --> 25:20.750]  So if we look at the on the X axis on the conservation
[25:20.750 --> 25:22.550]  and the different cannabinoids,
[25:22.550 --> 25:23.590]  so we see again,
[25:23.590 --> 25:25.630]  this is what I was telling you before,
[25:25.630 --> 25:29.430]  the higher conservation of THC and CBD and CBDVA,
[25:29.430 --> 25:32.150]  most of the cannabinoids that we tested
[25:32.150 --> 25:37.150]  were highest under the nutrient deficient plant
[25:38.070 --> 25:40.790]  and it decreased with time.
[25:40.790 --> 25:42.350]  And this is a good data
[25:42.350 --> 25:44.150]  for some of the terpenes that we measured
[25:44.150 --> 25:45.230]  and we can see,
[25:45.230 --> 25:47.550]  and this is for two varieties, by the way.
[25:47.550 --> 25:48.590]  So we can see again,
[25:48.590 --> 25:51.630]  the reduction highest concentration for most of them
[25:51.630 --> 25:53.630]  was under deficiency conditions,
[25:53.630 --> 25:54.670]  but not for all of them.
[25:54.670 --> 25:57.830]  For some case, some terpenes actually increased
[25:59.270 --> 26:01.230]  with increasing concentration.
[26:01.230 --> 26:03.470]  That means that it's not a general phenomenon.
[26:03.510 --> 26:07.710]  It's actually effect on specific biosynthetic pathways.
[26:07.710 --> 26:10.510]  So it depends if someone is interested
[26:10.510 --> 26:13.230]  in a specific terpenes or specific cannabinoid
[26:13.230 --> 26:14.910]  or specific flavonoid,
[26:14.910 --> 26:18.430]  the specific effect of whatever mineral nutrient
[26:18.430 --> 26:21.590]  or environmental condition in general
[26:21.590 --> 26:23.750]  will have to be studied.
[26:23.750 --> 26:26.630]  Just to show you that those responses,
[26:27.470 --> 26:31.430]  that the responses are of the plant responses
[26:31.470 --> 26:34.790]  follow what we see in the visually
[26:34.790 --> 26:37.070]  and follow the results of the biomass.
[26:37.070 --> 26:38.350]  So for example, if we look,
[26:38.350 --> 26:41.750]  we checked many, many physiological parameters.
[26:41.750 --> 26:43.830]  I only show a few of them here.
[26:43.830 --> 26:44.790]  So let's say, for example,
[26:44.790 --> 26:47.350]  if you look at photosynthesis or transpiration
[26:47.350 --> 26:49.110]  or somatic conductance,
[26:49.110 --> 26:50.870]  and these are in two varieties
[26:50.870 --> 26:52.830]  of two cultivars of cannabis,
[26:52.830 --> 26:55.310]  that we see again, deficiency plant,
[26:55.310 --> 26:56.950]  the function function is lower.
[26:56.950 --> 27:00.590]  Then we have an optimal range of plant function.
[27:00.590 --> 27:03.790]  And again, probably a toxicity range,
[27:03.790 --> 27:05.190]  a toxicity range.
[27:05.190 --> 27:06.870]  And we say to be on the safe side,
[27:06.870 --> 27:09.630]  probably a hundred PPM potassium
[27:09.630 --> 27:13.870]  is more than is sufficient for cultivation
[27:14.790 --> 27:16.190]  and the reproductive phase.
[27:17.950 --> 27:21.430]  And these are the biomass data for the same experiment
[27:21.430 --> 27:23.830]  that shows that under low concentration,
[27:23.830 --> 27:26.470]  of course, biomass will be lower
[27:26.470 --> 27:28.030]  than under higher concentration.
[27:29.030 --> 27:31.350]  This is the results for the inflorescence
[27:31.350 --> 27:32.190]  or the dry weight.
[27:32.190 --> 27:34.350]  So this is the yield.
[27:35.750 --> 27:39.190]  So we have a contradiction between the biomass,
[27:39.190 --> 27:41.430]  which increases with increased potassium
[27:41.430 --> 27:42.910]  and with increased nitrogen.
[27:42.910 --> 27:45.750]  And of course the concentration of cannabinoids
[27:45.750 --> 27:47.670]  and terpenoids decreases.
[27:49.710 --> 27:50.670]  Phosphorus, right?
[27:50.670 --> 27:54.110]  The big three in mineral nutrition is N, P and K, right?
[27:54.110 --> 27:56.110]  So we looked at nitrogen and we looked at potassium.
[27:56.590 --> 27:58.950]  Of course, we're now going to look at phosphorus.
[27:58.950 --> 28:03.030]  This was a study that was done by Sivan Shiponi,
[28:03.030 --> 28:05.590]  a master's student at the lab at the time.
[28:05.590 --> 28:08.550]  And she was looking at phosphorus
[28:08.550 --> 28:10.550]  in the vegetative growth phase
[28:10.550 --> 28:12.630]  and in the reproductive growth phase.
[28:12.630 --> 28:14.910]  So let's look at the vegetative first.
[28:14.910 --> 28:19.350]  And we show here the results for two different varieties.
[28:20.510 --> 28:24.230]  And again, we started because we had no idea where to start
[28:24.230 --> 28:25.830]  because there were no information.
[28:26.550 --> 28:27.750]  By the way, when I say no idea,
[28:27.750 --> 28:30.070]  it's not because, I mean,
[28:30.070 --> 28:31.910]  there's no science-based information.
[28:31.910 --> 28:35.990]  If we were to look at on the website,
[28:35.990 --> 28:37.950]  what we like to say, Dr. Google,
[28:37.950 --> 28:40.310]  we find thousands of blogs and many, many of them
[28:40.310 --> 28:43.190]  were saying and still say up to today,
[28:43.190 --> 28:45.150]  cannabis is hungry for phosphorus
[28:45.150 --> 28:48.070]  at the vegetative growth, at the flowering stage.
[28:48.070 --> 28:49.390]  You need to put a short phase.
[28:49.390 --> 28:51.510]  You need to put a lot of phosphorus at the time.
[28:51.510 --> 28:55.110]  Some blogs were saying as much as 600 PPM
[28:56.030 --> 28:59.910]  Now for whoever grows and has an experience with agriculture
[28:59.910 --> 29:02.350]  you know that normally the maximum that we do
[29:02.350 --> 29:05.390]  in soilless culture in pots is 30.
[29:05.390 --> 29:07.470]  So I thought I was actually pretty brave
[29:07.470 --> 29:09.030]  by going out all the way to 90
[29:09.030 --> 29:10.750]  because most of our regular crops
[29:10.750 --> 29:12.190]  will die under these conditions.
[29:12.190 --> 29:16.310]  But we said, who knows, maybe cannabis is really unique,
[29:16.310 --> 29:20.790]  but going above this, there was no need
[29:20.790 --> 29:21.910]  and we didn't dare do it.
[29:21.910 --> 29:24.190]  So we did a classical experiment
[29:24.190 --> 29:26.790]  from 5 PPM until 90 PPM.
[29:26.790 --> 29:29.470]  And I was wondering whether we'll get toxicity
[29:29.470 --> 29:33.110]  in spite of what we see by so many cultivators
[29:33.110 --> 29:34.830]  and growers that now we know
[29:34.830 --> 29:36.430]  that even use higher concentration.
[29:36.430 --> 29:40.470]  So let's see if it's needed, at least for our type of studies.
[29:40.470 --> 29:43.510]  What we find out that 5 and 15
[29:43.510 --> 29:45.790]  was not sufficient amount of phosphorus,
[29:45.790 --> 29:48.470]  but 30, you don't need to go above 30
[29:48.470 --> 29:50.270]  for the vegetative growth phase.
[29:50.270 --> 29:53.350]  30 give a wonderful plant function,
[29:53.390 --> 29:55.350]  optimal cultivation.
[29:55.350 --> 29:56.830]  Something that we did find
[29:57.710 --> 30:01.190]  is that there is a very large range of optimum range.
[30:01.190 --> 30:03.270]  So really from 15 to 90,
[30:03.270 --> 30:06.710]  there were no toxicity symptoms, even above 90.
[30:06.710 --> 30:09.710]  Biomass at 15 was pretty on the good side.
[30:09.710 --> 30:10.950]  In order to be on the safe side,
[30:10.950 --> 30:14.230]  we recommend to use 30 PPM,
[30:14.230 --> 30:16.910]  but definitely there's no need to go above it.
[30:16.910 --> 30:19.750]  And this is a graph,
[30:19.750 --> 30:21.710]  babies of the results for biomass
[30:21.710 --> 30:24.350]  for the plants that we've just seen in the previous slides.
[30:24.350 --> 30:26.710]  So we see the concentration of phosphorus
[30:26.710 --> 30:30.150]  and we look at the dry weight here for two varieties
[30:30.150 --> 30:34.190]  and we can see the increase from all the way up to 15
[30:34.190 --> 30:36.350]  and from 30 all the way up to 90,
[30:36.350 --> 30:38.870]  no change, no statistical significant change
[30:38.870 --> 30:40.710]  in any of those two varieties.
[30:40.710 --> 30:43.430]  And when we look at the function of these plants,
[30:43.430 --> 30:45.390]  so if you look, for example,
[30:45.390 --> 30:49.710]  at photosynthesis and transpiration and stomatoconductance,
[30:49.710 --> 30:50.750]  we see the same thing,
[30:51.550 --> 30:53.510]  maximum increase all the way up to 30
[30:53.510 --> 30:56.430]  and then in some cases even decrease.
[30:56.430 --> 30:58.630]  So optimal function after 30
[30:58.630 --> 31:02.230]  and really not because of yield biomass
[31:02.230 --> 31:04.030]  and not because of plant function,
[31:04.030 --> 31:06.630]  we find in the varieties that we work with,
[31:06.630 --> 31:08.510]  we found no reason to go above 30.
[31:10.150 --> 31:11.510]  Interesting thing of course,
[31:11.510 --> 31:16.070]  is what happened at the reproductive growth phase.
[31:16.070 --> 31:18.190]  So what happens at the reproductive growth phase,
[31:18.190 --> 31:19.790]  again, several varieties,
[31:19.830 --> 31:22.070]  we did experiment with those two varieties
[31:22.950 --> 31:26.550]  and with two varieties
[31:26.550 --> 31:29.550]  and we can see that the same concentration,
[31:29.550 --> 31:33.990]  low concentration gave the plants were deficient
[31:33.990 --> 31:35.790]  and that but all the way up to 19
[31:35.790 --> 31:39.470]  in terms of plant development and biomass production
[31:39.470 --> 31:40.790]  and yield production,
[31:40.790 --> 31:44.150]  there was no need to go above 30.
[31:44.150 --> 31:46.910]  The optimum again was all the way up to 90.
[31:46.910 --> 31:49.470]  So we didn't see any toxicity symptoms
[31:50.150 --> 31:51.630]  or oversupply under 90,
[31:51.630 --> 31:54.830]  but really there was no reason to go above 30.
[31:54.830 --> 31:56.550]  And what happened when we evaluated
[31:56.550 --> 31:58.150]  secondary metabolite production,
[31:58.150 --> 32:00.590]  the same thing that we saw for nitrogen and for potassium,
[32:00.590 --> 32:03.430]  also for P, also for phosphorus,
[32:03.430 --> 32:06.670]  the highest concentration was in those deficiency,
[32:06.670 --> 32:09.270]  in those hungry plants, in the deficient plants.
[32:12.030 --> 32:14.750]  So when we look at the data, the biomass,
[32:14.750 --> 32:17.510]  so again, what the plants that we've seen a minute ago,
[32:17.510 --> 32:19.990]  we see again an increase in dry weight
[32:20.870 --> 32:23.670]  all the way up to 30, above 30,
[32:23.670 --> 32:28.150]  the increase is not significant anymore.
[32:28.150 --> 32:30.350]  This is by the way, is total plant biomass.
[32:30.350 --> 32:31.830]  This is in fluorescent biomass.
[32:31.830 --> 32:33.990]  Each one of those organ biomass
[32:33.990 --> 32:36.990]  can be presented separately.
[32:36.990 --> 32:40.870]  And this is the same thing for a different variety.
[32:40.870 --> 32:45.870]  So we've seen very similar responses for both varieties.
[32:45.950 --> 32:47.910]  What happened about the secondary metabolites?
[32:47.910 --> 32:49.470]  So we presented some of them.
[32:49.470 --> 32:51.430]  There are more in the publication
[32:51.430 --> 32:53.110]  if you're interested to look in.
[32:53.110 --> 32:56.270]  And let's look, for example, at the CBDA,
[32:56.270 --> 32:59.710]  if we're to write the THCA, BVA, THCA,
[32:59.710 --> 33:03.790]  for most of them, highest conservation, as I said before,
[33:03.790 --> 33:06.430]  were under the deficiency conditions
[33:06.430 --> 33:11.430]  and it reduced with the increase in production.
[33:12.510 --> 33:14.590]  So as a grower, really it's difficult.
[33:14.590 --> 33:17.830]  Definitely we're not going to grow those hungry plants,
[33:17.830 --> 33:19.390]  you know, because they are small
[33:19.390 --> 33:23.230]  and they produce small amount of biomass.
[33:24.550 --> 33:25.750]  We have to choose somewhere,
[33:25.750 --> 33:29.110]  but increasing above the optimal
[33:29.110 --> 33:30.550]  is definitely not recommended
[33:30.550 --> 33:32.590]  because you are risking reducing
[33:32.590 --> 33:35.390]  the secondary metabolites even further.
[33:36.790 --> 33:38.230]  In terms of plant function,
[33:38.230 --> 33:41.110]  so if we look at photosynthesis and transpiration
[33:41.110 --> 33:44.870]  and stomatal conductance with the different concentrations,
[33:44.870 --> 33:46.670]  so we can see, again, classical,
[33:46.670 --> 33:48.270]  that in under 30 ppm,
[33:48.270 --> 33:50.510]  it's reached the maximum function
[33:50.510 --> 33:53.830]  of statistically significant in all of those plants.
[33:53.830 --> 33:57.190]  So there's no need to go way above 30,
[33:57.190 --> 34:00.270]  at least in the varieties that we've checked.
[34:02.310 --> 34:05.190]  Okay, so now we thought we know it all, you know.
[34:05.190 --> 34:09.030]  We checked N, P, and K, phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium.
[34:09.030 --> 34:12.350]  For all of them, biomass was increased until a central level
[34:12.350 --> 34:14.830]  and secondary metabolites was highest
[34:14.830 --> 34:17.110]  under deficiency conditions.
[34:17.110 --> 34:19.150]  Elif Mourad, a master's student in the lab,
[34:19.150 --> 34:21.390]  actually, we were just tested last week
[34:21.390 --> 34:25.950]  and finished a master project very successfully, I should say.
[34:25.950 --> 34:27.670]  And this is a paper that's in press.
[34:27.670 --> 34:30.110]  It's just going to come up probably in a week or two,
[34:30.110 --> 34:31.430]  be published online.
[34:33.430 --> 34:36.070]  And she checked, she worked on magnesium
[34:36.070 --> 34:39.590]  in the vegetative and on the reproductive growth phases.
[34:39.590 --> 34:41.750]  And what we found here, again,
[34:41.750 --> 34:43.790]  we tried for a very low concentration
[34:43.790 --> 34:46.310]  all the way to 140, which is quite high,
[34:46.310 --> 34:47.950]  a quite high concentration.
[34:49.030 --> 34:52.030]  And we found out that 2 ppms and 20 ppms
[34:52.030 --> 34:54.710]  were below optimal range,
[34:54.710 --> 34:59.270]  but from 35 until 140, this was still an optimum range.
[34:59.270 --> 35:01.190]  So we didn't, so it's not a toxicity.
[35:01.190 --> 35:03.470]  We didn't identify toxicity level,
[35:03.470 --> 35:08.470]  but 35 is sufficient to receive optimal growth
[35:10.590 --> 35:14.270]  and plant development in the vegetative stage.
[35:14.270 --> 35:16.430]  We can see this, you can see this here tabulated
[35:16.430 --> 35:19.230]  for the biomass production.
[35:19.230 --> 35:21.750]  So this would be the total of the plant.
[35:21.750 --> 35:23.430]  And here we look at the leaves
[35:23.430 --> 35:26.030]  and we can see that above 30,
[35:26.030 --> 35:28.350]  we don't get increase in plant growth.
[35:29.310 --> 35:31.190]  What happened in the reproductive stage,
[35:31.190 --> 35:32.710]  in the flowering stage,
[35:32.750 --> 35:37.750]  the same five concentration of magnesium was checked
[35:37.870 --> 35:40.670]  and we clearly see deficiency symptoms
[35:42.070 --> 35:44.550]  under the low concentration.
[35:44.550 --> 35:47.550]  And then we see an optimum concentration
[35:47.550 --> 35:51.110]  all the way up to 40 in terms of,
[35:51.110 --> 35:54.310]  but this is for yield quantity, right?
[35:54.310 --> 35:56.070]  And also, by the way, I want to say the reason
[35:56.070 --> 35:58.670]  why those branches are falling down,
[35:58.670 --> 36:00.190]  because in order to take a photograph,
[36:00.190 --> 36:01.950]  a nice photograph of them and put them
[36:02.190 --> 36:03.630]  behind the black screen,
[36:03.630 --> 36:05.670]  we have to remove them from the supporting wires.
[36:05.670 --> 36:06.750]  So the mirror that we did,
[36:06.750 --> 36:08.990]  and then after photography, they're being put in.
[36:08.990 --> 36:10.870]  So that's not the normal way that they grow,
[36:10.870 --> 36:12.270]  it's just to show the plant.
[36:13.190 --> 36:15.710]  So it's a, what we find, okay,
[36:15.710 --> 36:19.830]  so for here we say the range is somewhere between 20 to 140
[36:19.830 --> 36:21.790]  in terms of biomass yield,
[36:21.790 --> 36:25.470]  in terms of yield production, in terms of quantity.
[36:25.470 --> 36:26.990]  What happened in terms of quality?
[36:26.990 --> 36:30.110]  So we were kind of sure NPK gave us deficiency,
[36:30.110 --> 36:31.670]  the best concentration.
[36:32.350 --> 36:33.190]  So let's see what happened here.
[36:33.190 --> 36:34.030]  So you know what?
[36:34.030 --> 36:35.870]  This is now what happened for magnesium.
[36:35.870 --> 36:38.470]  Magnesium is very different.
[36:38.470 --> 36:40.230]  If we look at the concentration of magnesium,
[36:40.230 --> 36:42.630]  increasing concentration of magnesium on the x-axis,
[36:42.630 --> 36:46.350]  and we look here, I put an example of some cannabinoids,
[36:46.350 --> 36:47.950]  under the magnesium deficiency,
[36:47.950 --> 36:50.990]  we receive the very low concentration of cannabinoids,
[36:50.990 --> 36:52.070]  and they actually increase,
[36:52.070 --> 36:57.070]  and we receive an optimum concentration under 35 ppm.
[36:58.070 --> 37:02.470]  And only above 35 ppm for most cannabinoids,
[37:02.470 --> 37:04.670]  we receive no statistical difference.
[37:04.670 --> 37:06.990]  For some of them, there was a slight difference.
[37:06.990 --> 37:10.390]  So again, from the varieties that we took,
[37:10.390 --> 37:14.070]  that we evaluated, there's no reason to go above 35,
[37:14.070 --> 37:16.510]  but you need 35 in order to make sure
[37:16.510 --> 37:20.030]  that you don't hurt your production.
[37:20.030 --> 37:25.030]  By the way, it's the physiology of why each one of those,
[37:25.190 --> 37:28.790]  which minerals are affecting differently is fascinating.
[37:28.790 --> 37:30.750]  In terms of magnesium, magnesium, for example,
[37:30.750 --> 37:33.870]  is critical for ATP function,
[37:33.870 --> 37:38.070]  and for a function of more than 300 enzymes in the plant.
[37:38.070 --> 37:41.430]  And it's important for sugar loading into the flow,
[37:41.430 --> 37:43.630]  and therefore, translocation of sugars
[37:43.630 --> 37:45.910]  and carbohydrates to the flour.
[37:45.910 --> 37:50.030]  And it's critical for many, many other processes.
[37:50.030 --> 37:52.910]  It's a part of the chlorophyll,
[37:53.870 --> 37:56.110]  a chlorophyll molecule,
[37:56.110 --> 37:59.750]  and it's important for activity of rubisco,
[37:59.750 --> 38:02.590]  for photosynthesis.
[38:02.590 --> 38:06.390]  So the responses are not just responses for stress.
[38:06.390 --> 38:08.950]  It's not like we have nitrogen deficiency
[38:08.950 --> 38:12.630]  of whatever deficiency, that's why the plant increased.
[38:12.630 --> 38:15.870]  And because the responses for each one of those nutrients
[38:15.870 --> 38:19.790]  can be broken down to physiological factors
[38:19.830 --> 38:23.750]  that the plants are involved with,
[38:23.750 --> 38:26.350]  that the minerals are involved with.
[38:30.310 --> 38:32.830]  Okay, in terms of nutrient,
[38:32.830 --> 38:35.150]  that's probably almost the last group
[38:35.150 --> 38:37.670]  that I want to very quickly show.
[38:37.670 --> 38:40.070]  And this is the work that was done again by Aviyar
[38:40.070 --> 38:42.710]  during his PhD studies.
[38:42.710 --> 38:46.110]  For nitrogen, there are two major forms of nitrogen
[38:46.110 --> 38:49.030]  that the plant can take up, and they're very different.
[38:49.070 --> 38:51.910]  One of them is ammonium, which is NO3 minus,
[38:51.910 --> 38:52.870]  so it's an anion.
[38:52.870 --> 38:56.350]  The other one is nitrate, which is NO3 minus,
[38:56.350 --> 38:58.710]  and then ammonium, which is NO4 plus,
[38:58.710 --> 39:00.870]  so it's an anion and a cation.
[39:00.870 --> 39:03.590]  And it affects very much physiology of the plant,
[39:03.590 --> 39:06.070]  or even up to the level of pH of the cytoplasm
[39:06.070 --> 39:09.750]  and many other compounds,
[39:09.750 --> 39:11.750]  many other processes in the plants.
[39:11.750 --> 39:13.070]  So it's always a question,
[39:13.070 --> 39:15.230]  okay, we know how much nitrogen to give,
[39:15.230 --> 39:18.510]  what ratio of ammonium to nitrate should we give?
[39:18.510 --> 39:21.710]  So we tested this, and this is an experiment.
[39:21.710 --> 39:24.350]  We gave either 100%,
[39:24.350 --> 39:26.590]  so this is the percentage of ammonium
[39:27.510 --> 39:29.510]  among all the nitrogen that was given.
[39:29.510 --> 39:33.310]  So we either gave it as 100% nitrate,
[39:33.310 --> 39:36.030]  or 100% ammonia, or ratios of name.
[39:36.030 --> 39:38.270]  So there's a percentage of ammonium.
[39:38.270 --> 39:42.230]  It's zero, 10, 30, 50, and 100%
[39:42.230 --> 39:45.790]  from all the nitrogen that we gave the plants.
[39:45.790 --> 39:49.190]  And this again is also, of course, published.
[39:49.190 --> 39:51.710]  And what we can see, even just by looking at the plant,
[39:51.710 --> 39:54.990]  100 ppm ammonium, the plant did not survive,
[39:54.990 --> 39:57.150]  so all the plants died.
[39:57.150 --> 39:59.950]  0% ammonia, meaning 100% nitrate,
[39:59.950 --> 40:02.110]  the plants were really happy.
[40:02.110 --> 40:03.510]  And we are looking at the biomass,
[40:03.510 --> 40:05.550]  it's easy to see this on the biomass.
[40:05.550 --> 40:07.390]  We see that the highest plant,
[40:08.590 --> 40:10.750]  the best morphology, the highest plant growth
[40:10.750 --> 40:14.910]  and development actually occurred under 0% ammonia,
[40:14.910 --> 40:19.190]  100% nitrogen nutrition, which is what cannabis prefers.
[40:19.190 --> 40:21.310]  How does it affect cannabinoids?
[40:21.310 --> 40:22.550]  So the same thing.
[40:22.550 --> 40:26.750]  We saw the highest production of cannabinoids under 0%,
[40:26.750 --> 40:29.510]  of some cannabinoids under 0% ammonia,
[40:29.510 --> 40:32.030]  so 100% nitrate for some of them.
[40:32.030 --> 40:33.230]  For some of the cannabinoids,
[40:33.230 --> 40:36.070]  the differences were not statistical.
[40:36.070 --> 40:41.070]  So probably we are safe to go all the way up to 30% ammonium
[40:42.070 --> 40:47.070]  if needed, but probably 0% ammonium is better for cannabis.
[40:50.150 --> 40:55.150]  The last slide that I want to show today for the nutrients
[40:56.110 --> 41:00.550]  is this with, sorry,
[41:00.550 --> 41:04.030]  this with the way that we calculate,
[41:04.030 --> 41:07.030]  the way that we need to calculate how much mineral
[41:07.030 --> 41:10.310]  to give the plant in every stage of growth.
[41:10.310 --> 41:11.790]  The studies that I showed now
[41:11.790 --> 41:14.350]  or we have to start with somewhere.
[41:14.350 --> 41:16.750]  So we have to find out what's the response of the plant
[41:16.750 --> 41:19.310]  to different levels of those minerals.
[41:19.310 --> 41:22.710]  And by the way, we have conducted experiments in the lab
[41:22.710 --> 41:24.230]  in other nutrients as well,
[41:24.230 --> 41:26.990]  on zinc and manganese and many others
[41:26.990 --> 41:30.270]  that we are in the process of summing them up
[41:30.270 --> 41:34.390]  for publication, but this was a steady concentration
[41:34.390 --> 41:37.430]  throughout the cultivation, throughout the vegetative
[41:37.430 --> 41:39.590]  or throughout the reproductive phase,
[41:39.630 --> 41:41.270]  other than doing flushing in the end,
[41:41.270 --> 41:43.390]  which means reducing level of concentration
[41:43.390 --> 41:46.310]  at the last we can have a growth.
[41:47.270 --> 41:49.150]  But still there's another level,
[41:49.150 --> 41:53.870]  many levels of layering that need to be investigated
[41:53.870 --> 41:55.470]  in order to understand plant response.
[41:55.470 --> 41:59.510]  For example, should we give different concentration
[41:59.510 --> 42:00.350]  every week?
[42:00.350 --> 42:02.190]  This depends on how much of the plants
[42:02.190 --> 42:03.790]  actually take up every week.
[42:03.790 --> 42:05.350]  At the beginning of the plants are smaller,
[42:05.350 --> 42:07.950]  definitely they take up less than when they're larger.
[42:07.950 --> 42:11.710]  And also the phrenological differences
[42:11.710 --> 42:13.590]  that in different stages of development,
[42:13.590 --> 42:16.910]  the plant might need more or less, more or less.
[42:16.910 --> 42:19.070]  So how do we deal with this?
[42:19.070 --> 42:21.350]  In agriculture, we usually try to develop
[42:21.350 --> 42:23.710]  what's called the position rate curves.
[42:23.710 --> 42:24.790]  What is the position rate?
[42:24.790 --> 42:27.670]  It's how much nitrogen is being deposited into the plant
[42:27.670 --> 42:29.110]  in the first week of cultivation,
[42:29.110 --> 42:30.430]  second week of cultivation,
[42:30.430 --> 42:32.070]  third week of cultivation and so on.
[42:32.070 --> 42:34.630]  How much copper, how much molybdenum,
[42:34.630 --> 42:37.230]  how much iron, how much post-source and so on.
[42:37.230 --> 42:39.630]  So we're working on this and this is a, again,
[42:39.630 --> 42:42.150]  this is a publication that will come up very soon.
[42:43.110 --> 42:46.190]  And we're looking in this rate, it's time after planting.
[42:46.190 --> 42:48.750]  So unlike the previous curve, we're looking at age,
[42:48.750 --> 42:50.510]  at age of the plant.
[42:50.510 --> 42:54.190]  The first group of curves is for the vegetative stage
[42:54.190 --> 42:57.470]  of growth and this is for the flowering stage of growth.
[42:57.470 --> 43:00.310]  So we cut the plants many, many times destructively
[43:00.310 --> 43:02.870]  and analyze how much minerals in the leaves
[43:02.870 --> 43:04.030]  and the shoots and roots.
[43:04.030 --> 43:07.030]  So we can know how much the plant takes up every week.
[43:07.830 --> 43:09.510]  So this is just gram per plant.
[43:09.510 --> 43:11.550]  So we can see that, of course, as the plant grows,
[43:11.550 --> 43:14.990]  there's an increase in amount of nutrients.
[43:14.990 --> 43:19.990]  Now, if we take the difference integral
[43:20.270 --> 43:21.870]  between one point to the other,
[43:21.870 --> 43:24.110]  this will give us the deposition rate curve,
[43:24.110 --> 43:26.030]  which means how much goes into the plant
[43:26.030 --> 43:27.590]  in the first week and the second week
[43:27.590 --> 43:29.630]  and the third week and so on.
[43:29.630 --> 43:31.350]  It's so complicated and there's no time
[43:31.350 --> 43:34.390]  to clearly show it here, but just what I want to show you
[43:34.390 --> 43:36.670]  that there are differences between nutrients.
[43:37.310 --> 43:39.230]  For example, if we look at nitrogen all the way up
[43:39.230 --> 43:41.710]  to the end of cultivation,
[43:41.710 --> 43:45.390]  the plant keep on taking nitrogen and phosphorus
[43:45.390 --> 43:48.510]  and iron and potassium.
[43:48.510 --> 43:50.270]  But if we look at calcium,
[43:51.430 --> 43:55.230]  no, they stopped taking calcium much more early.
[43:55.230 --> 43:57.350]  So for example, this was done by the way
[43:57.350 --> 43:59.510]  for between three and five cultivars.
[43:59.510 --> 44:01.670]  So this tells us, for example,
[44:01.670 --> 44:03.590]  that probably during this stage of growth,
[44:03.590 --> 44:07.070]  there's no more need to fertilize with calcium.
[44:07.070 --> 44:09.710]  And it also tells us how much to give
[44:09.710 --> 44:12.030]  at every stages of growth.
[44:12.030 --> 44:15.030]  So this is the next level I think that we need to deal with.
[44:16.030 --> 44:17.630]  What else do we do in the lab?
[44:17.630 --> 44:18.790]  And I'm not going to show this.
[44:18.790 --> 44:20.230]  Obviously, we're dealing with nutrition.
[44:20.230 --> 44:22.030]  I just thought that you may want to be interested
[44:22.030 --> 44:24.550]  or interested to look at some of our publication.
[44:24.550 --> 44:26.350]  We're dealing with light quality,
[44:26.350 --> 44:29.030]  so spectrum effect on plant growth,
[44:29.030 --> 44:31.790]  light intensity, temperature effect,
[44:31.790 --> 44:34.030]  studies about flowering control,
[44:34.030 --> 44:36.550]  a lot of work about post-harvest chemical changes
[44:36.550 --> 44:37.910]  to see what happened post-harvest
[44:37.910 --> 44:41.710]  and how can we affect post-harvest by cultivation?
[44:41.710 --> 44:44.310]  Because sometimes cultivation affects,
[44:44.310 --> 44:47.030]  and nutrition as well, affect post-harvest.
[44:47.030 --> 44:48.990]  Effect of botanical and conventional
[44:48.990 --> 44:50.550]  pest management treatments
[44:50.550 --> 44:52.550]  because we have to deal with contamination
[44:52.550 --> 44:57.550]  and many other issues.
[44:58.510 --> 44:59.350]  Okay.
[44:59.350 --> 45:03.030]  Okay, we also do a lot of work on plant architecture.
[45:03.030 --> 45:05.910]  So this is for standardization.
[45:05.910 --> 45:06.910]  If we look at a plant,
[45:06.910 --> 45:11.310]  we analyze conservation at primary and secondary florescence.
[45:11.310 --> 45:13.630]  So these are the colors, so to speak,
[45:13.630 --> 45:15.510]  with more inerrant florescence,
[45:15.510 --> 45:16.990]  which have more shading.
[45:16.990 --> 45:19.710]  And we analyze the difference between microclimate
[45:19.710 --> 45:23.230]  in the plant and stabilization and conservation.
[45:23.230 --> 45:26.190]  We did this on more than four varieties.
[45:26.390 --> 45:28.670]  It's published in two or three publications.
[45:28.670 --> 45:30.150]  This is control plants,
[45:30.150 --> 45:32.150]  plants that we only did defoliation,
[45:32.150 --> 45:33.310]  only removing the leaves,
[45:33.310 --> 45:36.590]  removing leaves and branches from the bottom of a plant,
[45:36.590 --> 45:38.990]  only removing secondary branches and so on.
[45:38.990 --> 45:42.790]  One trim or two trim, pinching and two pinching to the plant.
[45:42.790 --> 45:46.910]  And of course, all of this in order to see the effect
[45:46.910 --> 45:50.590]  on solidization and on the yield quantity.
[45:50.590 --> 45:53.750]  We also checked, and this was done by Nadav Dantzinger,
[45:54.630 --> 45:57.030]  who was a master's student in the lab at the time.
[45:57.030 --> 46:00.630]  And also the same type of plant pruning,
[46:00.630 --> 46:02.870]  how are they affected by plant density?
[46:02.870 --> 46:04.510]  Because plant density is very important,
[46:04.510 --> 46:06.710]  whether you plant one plant per meter,
[46:06.710 --> 46:08.430]  two plants per meter, 10 plants per meter.
[46:08.430 --> 46:11.070]  Of course, it's a matter of the interaction
[46:11.070 --> 46:14.070]  between plant architecture and plant density.
[46:15.430 --> 46:19.310]  To summarize, I want to say that, first of all,
[46:19.310 --> 46:22.350]  we found out and we know that minimal nutrition,
[46:22.590 --> 46:25.870]  I showed today NPK and magnesium,
[46:25.870 --> 46:27.470]  has a considerable impact
[46:27.470 --> 46:29.950]  on secondary metabolism in cannabis.
[46:29.950 --> 46:34.950]  So there's a power and there's a potential for those
[46:36.550 --> 46:40.750]  in order to control secondary metabolism.
[46:40.750 --> 46:42.550]  We have to be careful with this.
[46:42.550 --> 46:45.550]  Second thing is that yield quantity and chemical quality
[46:45.550 --> 46:49.270]  are very often affected differently by mineral nutrition.
[46:49.270 --> 46:51.150]  And therefore there is an urgent need
[46:51.150 --> 46:55.710]  for science-based plant science information
[46:55.710 --> 46:58.710]  to support the developing cannabis industry.
[46:58.710 --> 47:00.510]  And plant science is important,
[47:00.510 --> 47:01.750]  it's the basic for everything,
[47:01.750 --> 47:05.910]  for nutrition, for any economical process.
[47:05.910 --> 47:08.270]  And so there are many challenges
[47:08.270 --> 47:10.110]  and there are also breakthroughs.
[47:10.110 --> 47:14.030]  Definitely we need further development of our technologies
[47:14.030 --> 47:16.390]  for improvement of cultivation,
[47:16.390 --> 47:19.070]  both for quantity and for quality.
[47:19.070 --> 47:20.990]  Development of advanced technologies
[47:20.990 --> 47:23.110]  for directing the chemical quality,
[47:23.110 --> 47:25.030]  so not only the quantity.
[47:25.030 --> 47:29.070]  And controlling the chemical quality is a major issue
[47:29.070 --> 47:31.390]  for specific chemical indication.
[47:31.390 --> 47:35.190]  So once we will know what secondary metabolites
[47:35.190 --> 47:37.670]  are required for whatever indication,
[47:37.670 --> 47:40.470]  it's not only a need to identify which strain,
[47:40.470 --> 47:43.070]  which cultivar works on whatever medical indication,
[47:43.070 --> 47:45.310]  it's also will be a need how to make sure
[47:45.310 --> 47:48.030]  that it produces the same profile
[47:48.030 --> 47:51.790]  consistently within and between the batches of growth.
[47:51.790 --> 47:54.630]  And I wanna thank my amazing lab group,
[47:54.630 --> 47:56.950]  which is changing throughout the years.
[47:56.950 --> 47:58.310]  Many of them don't want to leave
[47:58.310 --> 48:00.870]  and we're doing master's and PhD and whatever.
[48:01.990 --> 48:05.230]  It's a very, very difficult studying medical cannabis,
[48:05.230 --> 48:07.150]  is really difficult because of the regulation.
[48:07.150 --> 48:09.550]  We spend a lot of time under cameras
[48:09.550 --> 48:12.590]  and other motion sensors and detectors and whatever.
[48:12.590 --> 48:15.710]  And it's very dedicated group that was facilitated
[48:16.430 --> 48:18.750]  the accumulation of the information
[48:18.750 --> 48:20.830]  that we were able to do.
[48:20.830 --> 48:22.590]  The funding for the studies that I show you
[48:22.590 --> 48:24.270]  comes from the Chief Scientist Fund
[48:24.270 --> 48:26.710]  of the Ministry of Agriculture in Israel.
[48:26.710 --> 48:31.590]  Because in 1916, cannabis was declared as a crop in Israel,
[48:31.590 --> 48:33.190]  which is a legal definition.
[48:33.190 --> 48:35.750]  It means that we are allowed to apply for funding
[48:35.750 --> 48:37.750]  to study this plant.
[48:37.750 --> 48:39.710]  And in the beginning, some of the plant material
[48:39.710 --> 48:42.310]  that we use came up from three growers in Israel
[48:42.350 --> 48:46.030]  from Kendo, which we still collaborate a lot with,
[48:46.030 --> 48:51.030]  from BOL Pharma and from El Fonteva in the past.
[48:51.870 --> 48:54.390]  And some of the, we're working together
[48:54.390 --> 48:55.510]  with Dr. Molly Zaks,
[48:55.510 --> 48:57.590]  who was from the Extension Service in Israel
[48:57.590 --> 49:00.270]  on the composition of the nutrient solution,
[49:00.270 --> 49:02.230]  which is not an easy thing to do
[49:02.230 --> 49:05.510]  in order to maintain such very good level of stability
[49:05.510 --> 49:08.070]  between the treatment.
[49:08.070 --> 49:09.470]  And that's it, thank you.
[49:11.870 --> 49:14.190]  Thank you so much, Dr. Bernstein.
[49:14.190 --> 49:16.350]  You have some, several questions,
[49:16.350 --> 49:17.550]  and I'm sure there will be more
[49:17.550 --> 49:19.630]  as we are talking right now.
[49:19.630 --> 49:21.510]  So would you like for me to read the questions
[49:21.510 --> 49:23.230]  or you wanna access them yourself?
[49:24.550 --> 49:26.030]  I can access them myself.
[49:26.030 --> 49:26.870]  Okay.
[49:28.150 --> 49:29.750]  Have you seen any modification,
[49:30.830 --> 49:32.150]  it's only me that sees this, right?
[49:32.150 --> 49:34.950]  I have to read them out loud, the questions, right?
[49:34.950 --> 49:37.910]  Yes, I will show you, you can read them out loud, yes.
[49:37.910 --> 49:40.230]  Okay, have you seen any modification
[49:40.790 --> 49:42.270]  in plant gender sex
[49:42.270 --> 49:44.910]  based on different fertilization treatments?
[49:44.910 --> 49:45.790]  Good questions.
[49:45.790 --> 49:49.150]  We were very concerned about this
[49:49.150 --> 49:50.630]  because we were expecting that maybe
[49:50.630 --> 49:53.870]  under stress conditions, we will see sex change.
[49:53.870 --> 49:55.870]  The answer is no, we didn't,
[49:55.870 --> 49:57.670]  but we did see under stress
[49:57.670 --> 49:59.750]  if something went wrong with the irrigation system
[49:59.750 --> 50:01.230]  and the plant didn't receive irrigation,
[50:01.230 --> 50:03.870]  obviously that we had a male development,
[50:03.870 --> 50:06.230]  but not under stress with nutrients,
[50:06.230 --> 50:08.430]  with nutrients in none of our experiments.
[50:09.430 --> 50:11.630]  Another question is, could it be
[50:11.630 --> 50:15.390]  that the lower nitrogen level had a higher concentration
[50:15.390 --> 50:17.990]  because there was less biomass,
[50:19.590 --> 50:22.470]  meaning the same quantity of THC,
[50:22.470 --> 50:25.710]  but less biomass, meaning higher concentrations.
[50:25.710 --> 50:27.230]  So this is a really good question.
[50:27.230 --> 50:31.030]  When we deal with nutrition and concentration of an element,
[50:31.030 --> 50:34.470]  we many times think about what we call a dilution effect,
[50:34.470 --> 50:36.630]  which is what was described here
[50:36.830 --> 50:38.790]  by the person that asked it.
[50:38.790 --> 50:40.950]  So maybe it's the same amount that's being produced,
[50:40.950 --> 50:43.150]  it's just higher because it's under,
[50:44.830 --> 50:46.710]  because it's in less biomass.
[50:46.710 --> 50:49.430]  So the answer is that we don't think so.
[50:49.430 --> 50:52.670]  And because there's no time to go into,
[50:52.670 --> 50:54.030]  to dip into metabolomics,
[50:54.030 --> 50:55.750]  what we've done for the nitrogen studies,
[50:55.750 --> 50:58.750]  we also have done metabolomics, primary metabolomics,
[50:58.750 --> 51:01.190]  that the study will probably come up really soon.
[51:01.190 --> 51:03.950]  And what we know that's happening is that,
[51:04.150 --> 51:07.150]  our hypothesis was that under high,
[51:07.150 --> 51:10.310]  when there is enough nitrogen, what does the plant produce?
[51:10.310 --> 51:15.190]  It throws it into proteins, DNA, and so on, and growth.
[51:15.190 --> 51:16.750]  So under, if there's enough nitrogen,
[51:16.750 --> 51:19.350]  there's enough growth and primary metabolism.
[51:19.350 --> 51:21.550]  When there's not enough nitrogen,
[51:21.550 --> 51:23.390]  we still get some photosynthesis,
[51:23.390 --> 51:24.590]  that we still have energy,
[51:24.590 --> 51:28.030]  but not enough in order to build high nitrogen compounds.
[51:28.030 --> 51:31.070]  And that's when the plant, there's a metabolic shift,
[51:31.070 --> 51:32.150]  that was our hypothesis,
[51:32.150 --> 51:34.110]  and it's worked out to be, this is the case,
[51:34.110 --> 51:35.870]  that there's a metabolic shift,
[51:35.870 --> 51:39.710]  to our production of compounds that don't contain nitrogen,
[51:39.710 --> 51:42.670]  such as cannabinoids.
[51:42.670 --> 51:45.590]  So we believe that under nitrogen, what we're seeing,
[51:45.590 --> 51:48.670]  we are seeing a metabolic shift under,
[51:48.670 --> 51:51.510]  to a level we call them C metabolites.
[51:51.510 --> 51:53.990]  Metabolites that don't contain nitrogen,
[51:53.990 --> 51:56.790]  because there's not enough nitrogen to support growth,
[51:56.790 --> 51:59.790]  be a production of proteins,
[51:59.790 --> 52:04.790]  or amino acid, or nitrogen, DNA, and RNA, and so on.
[52:08.150 --> 52:12.750]  Okay, another question is, does NPK affect male,
[52:12.750 --> 52:15.670]  okay, this was already asked,
[52:15.670 --> 52:17.390]  whether we can use this for breeding.
[52:17.390 --> 52:19.230]  So this is, I answered this.
[52:20.510 --> 52:24.310]  Another question is, did you estimate total secondary
[52:24.310 --> 52:26.870]  metabolite production per plant,
[52:26.870 --> 52:29.270]  with the nutrient deficiency studies?
[52:29.750 --> 52:32.150]  For example, the deficient plants at higher concentration,
[52:32.150 --> 52:34.270]  but due to biomass reduction,
[52:34.270 --> 52:36.990]  are total secondary metabolite production lower?
[52:36.990 --> 52:38.310]  Okay, so we checked this,
[52:38.310 --> 52:40.950]  and it's available in the publication,
[52:40.950 --> 52:42.510]  you can take a look at it,
[52:42.510 --> 52:45.030]  because we also thought maybe it can be,
[52:45.030 --> 52:46.750]  for people who are doing extraction,
[52:46.750 --> 52:48.870]  maybe this can work out,
[52:48.870 --> 52:50.790]  you know, if we get low biomass,
[52:50.790 --> 52:54.030]  but huge amount of concentration,
[52:54.030 --> 52:57.390]  it still may be that for extraction,
[52:57.390 --> 53:01.430]  if we use, if we get more biomass with lower,
[53:01.430 --> 53:04.030]  with lower concentration, maybe the number,
[53:04.030 --> 53:08.590]  the amount, the weight of the secondary metabolites
[53:08.590 --> 53:09.910]  will stay the same.
[53:09.910 --> 53:12.630]  So this was not the case, and I mean,
[53:12.630 --> 53:14.910]  it was not the case, so when there's a reduction,
[53:14.910 --> 53:17.830]  there's a reduction for overall plant,
[53:17.830 --> 53:21.430]  and you can see the calculations in our manuscript.
[53:23.390 --> 53:24.870]  Okay, another question,
[53:24.870 --> 53:26.590]  this is probably an ignorant question,
[53:26.590 --> 53:28.030]  there's no ignorant questions.
[53:29.910 --> 53:31.310]  I say a lot in plant science,
[53:31.310 --> 53:34.710]  but I don't understand why the concentration of a nutrient
[53:34.710 --> 53:39.710]  should be transient in comparing impact
[53:40.270 --> 53:43.190]  of cultivation strategy was transient,
[53:43.190 --> 53:45.110]  I don't know what it is.
[53:45.110 --> 53:49.430]  The concentration would be in external water supplied,
[53:49.430 --> 53:52.470]  but not absorbed in totally by the plant.
[53:52.470 --> 53:54.790]  What about total amount of water absorbed,
[53:54.790 --> 53:57.470]  size of the plant, rate of transpiration,
[53:57.470 --> 53:59.350]  and all the other variables?
[53:59.350 --> 54:02.710]  I would think this is like talking about
[54:02.710 --> 54:07.710]  the relative impact of feeding a child porridge
[54:08.630 --> 54:13.630]  made of 50% oats and 50% water, rather than 60-40.
[54:13.670 --> 54:17.070]  Wouldn't the key thing be the quantity of oats
[54:17.070 --> 54:21.630]  actually absorbed, not to mention frequency of feeding?
[54:21.630 --> 54:23.070]  Okay, I'll explain the question,
[54:23.070 --> 54:24.910]  I think it's a wonderful question.
[54:24.910 --> 54:26.190]  The question actually deals,
[54:26.190 --> 54:28.230]  if we put it in agronomic terms,
[54:28.230 --> 54:29.830]  deals about the interaction
[54:29.830 --> 54:32.910]  between irrigation and fertilization.
[54:32.910 --> 54:35.950]  If we give, because what we were talking,
[54:35.950 --> 54:40.950]  I was talking about in the webinar today,
[54:41.710 --> 54:44.990]  I was talking about concentration that we give in the plants.
[54:44.990 --> 54:48.110]  So we give same volume with same concentration.
[54:48.110 --> 54:49.790]  And I also said that we make sure
[54:49.790 --> 54:51.230]  that we have 30% of leachate,
[54:51.230 --> 54:55.710]  so we stay with relatively similar concentration.
[54:55.710 --> 54:57.430]  But what the question was,
[54:57.430 --> 55:00.590]  and it's a matter of also of how much we give,
[55:00.590 --> 55:04.550]  because if we give one liter with certain concentration,
[55:04.550 --> 55:06.830]  or we give two liters with same concentration,
[55:06.830 --> 55:09.630]  or we give three liters with same concentration,
[55:09.630 --> 55:14.270]  total amount of nutrients that we gave the plant differs.
[55:14.270 --> 55:15.830]  So this is a good question.
[55:15.830 --> 55:19.110]  The reason why it's not an issue in our study
[55:19.710 --> 55:21.470]  is because we're using,
[55:21.470 --> 55:24.230]  that's why in mineral nutrition studies,
[55:24.230 --> 55:29.230]  we usually try to use inert soil, inert media, growing media.
[55:29.230 --> 55:31.110]  So we were using perlite.
[55:31.110 --> 55:33.030]  And we have 30% of leachate.
[55:33.030 --> 55:36.470]  That means that even if we take now and give two liters,
[55:36.470 --> 55:37.790]  what will happen,
[55:37.790 --> 55:40.470]  the amount of water that will stay in the container
[55:40.470 --> 55:43.630]  is the maximum amount of water that the container can hold,
[55:43.630 --> 55:45.870]  and the rest of it will leach down.
[55:45.870 --> 55:46.710]  Will leach down.
[55:46.710 --> 55:50.030]  Once we monitor the volume that leached down
[55:50.030 --> 55:52.310]  and how much we give and keep it steady,
[55:52.310 --> 55:55.830]  that means that the plant received equal amounts,
[55:55.830 --> 55:59.670]  based similar, the plant is exposed to equal amounts,
[55:59.670 --> 56:04.670]  and in addition to equal concentrations.
[56:05.150 --> 56:06.550]  So I hope this was clear.
[56:06.550 --> 56:07.990]  If not, please ask again.
[56:11.310 --> 56:12.950]  Another question was,
[56:13.950 --> 56:19.700]  is there a textbook that would capture
[56:19.700 --> 56:22.500]  much or all of this information?
[56:23.500 --> 56:25.260]  I'm asked this question very much.
[56:25.260 --> 56:28.180]  How come that you haven't published a book yet
[56:28.180 --> 56:30.460]  about mineral nutrition of plants?
[56:30.460 --> 56:31.660]  You know, it's very tempting
[56:31.660 --> 56:33.620]  when we only have nitrogen and potassium,
[56:33.620 --> 56:35.220]  we're saying, well, maybe it's time now.
[56:35.220 --> 56:38.380]  Now there's still many, many ways to go.
[56:38.380 --> 56:41.300]  I think that there is a need, really.
[56:41.300 --> 56:43.540]  I think there's a need for a cannabis study.
[56:43.860 --> 56:45.380]  I think it's going to be very challenging
[56:45.380 --> 56:47.100]  because from the time that the textbook
[56:47.100 --> 56:49.900]  will begin to be written until it's being closed,
[56:49.900 --> 56:52.020]  probably the amount of information will double
[56:52.020 --> 56:54.660]  because people are just now starting
[56:54.660 --> 56:57.020]  to work intensively on it.
[56:57.020 --> 56:59.180]  And I fully agree that there is a need
[56:59.180 --> 57:02.780]  for textbook on cannabis.
[57:02.780 --> 57:03.860]  We're thinking about it.
[57:03.860 --> 57:05.820]  Other people are thinking about it as well,
[57:05.820 --> 57:07.660]  but we are not there.
[57:07.660 --> 57:08.500]  Not there.
[57:08.540 --> 57:11.060]  Can you discuss the concentration of nutrients
[57:11.060 --> 57:16.060]  you have reviewed in relationship with each other?
[57:16.060 --> 57:18.900]  For example, the amount of N versus P
[57:18.900 --> 57:21.620]  in various stages of plant development.
[57:21.620 --> 57:24.140]  This is a really good question.
[57:24.140 --> 57:28.220]  A very important issue in plant nutrition
[57:28.220 --> 57:31.460]  is not only the absolute amount that we give the plant,
[57:31.460 --> 57:33.900]  but also the ratio between nutrients.
[57:33.900 --> 57:36.100]  So, for example, if you have a plant
[57:36.780 --> 57:39.380]  but also the ratio between nutrients.
[57:39.380 --> 57:42.620]  So, and this comes from many reasons.
[57:42.620 --> 57:45.140]  One of them is that there's interaction
[57:45.140 --> 57:47.340]  between nutrients for uptake into the plant.
[57:47.340 --> 57:50.460]  So if, for example, we have in a soil solution,
[57:50.460 --> 57:52.740]  in a root solution, we have higher conservation
[57:52.740 --> 57:56.140]  of calcium, which we worked on,
[57:56.140 --> 57:57.740]  and we'll publish this soon.
[57:57.740 --> 58:01.940]  It will reduce uptake of other cations
[58:01.940 --> 58:04.020]  such as magnesium and potassium, for example.
[58:04.020 --> 58:05.020]  So this is one reason.
[58:05.020 --> 58:06.780]  Another thing, there can be interaction
[58:06.780 --> 58:07.900]  in the plant as well.
[58:07.900 --> 58:10.540]  There'll be competition for uptake in the plant,
[58:10.540 --> 58:14.580]  competition for translocation from the root to the shoot,
[58:14.580 --> 58:16.980]  and specific physiological interaction.
[58:17.940 --> 58:22.940]  So as I said, even though we are investigating this issue
[58:23.540 --> 58:27.340]  for several years, very intensively,
[58:27.340 --> 58:30.740]  this is the first stage.
[58:30.740 --> 58:33.620]  And because from my point of view,
[58:33.700 --> 58:37.140]  I mean, my point of view, we have to start somewhere.
[58:37.140 --> 58:40.220]  And because there's absolutely zero information,
[58:40.220 --> 58:42.620]  my choice, the way that I chose to do it
[58:42.620 --> 58:44.820]  is to start working on each nutrient separately,
[58:44.820 --> 58:46.980]  giving the next, the other nutrient
[58:46.980 --> 58:48.900]  in the optimum concentration.
[58:48.900 --> 58:50.540]  So after we finish, for example,
[58:50.540 --> 58:53.100]  the nitrogen concentration for potassium,
[58:53.100 --> 58:55.660]  we already optimized in this experiment
[58:55.660 --> 58:57.180]  based on what we know.
[58:57.180 --> 59:00.220]  Of course, there is interaction between nutrients.
[59:00.220 --> 59:03.340]  There've been one or two studies
[59:04.020 --> 59:05.780]  that came up for cannabis that started to deal
[59:05.780 --> 59:07.700]  with interaction between nutrients.
[59:08.900 --> 59:13.860]  So different researcher may have different point of view.
[59:13.860 --> 59:18.140]  My opinion is that only now after I know what's the range,
[59:18.140 --> 59:21.180]  what's the optimal range, deficiency or toxicity range,
[59:21.180 --> 59:22.860]  now within this optimal range,
[59:22.860 --> 59:27.860]  we need to optimize for ratios between nutrients.
[59:28.220 --> 59:32.900]  Before we actually knew roughly where the optimum range is,
[59:33.700 --> 59:36.860]  it's going to be almost impossible to have a grid
[59:36.860 --> 59:40.420]  of 300 to 400 treatments in order to do it.
[59:40.420 --> 59:44.460]  It's possible, but it also forces reduction in repetitions
[59:44.460 --> 59:46.260]  in the per treatment and so on.
[59:46.260 --> 59:50.540]  So what I think is that there are several stages.
[59:50.540 --> 59:53.340]  First stage, very important stage from my point of view
[59:53.340 --> 59:58.260]  is to evaluate effects for a range of concentrations.
[59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.980]  A different issue then is to evaluate for a range of ratios
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:06.460]  between nutrients, between different nutrients,
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.660]  and of course, to evaluate effects
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.420]  on different duration of growth.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.260]  So this is, I mean,
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.540]  trying to close a research gap of 30 years.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.580]  It's 30 or 40 years.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.100]  It's very, we are heading in this direction
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.820]  and we're working as fast as possible
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.380]  as well as other groups.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.380]  And definitely it's important.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.820]  But I also want to say one last sentence
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.780]  is that because we've analyzed, I mean,
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.860]  in all of our studies,
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.620]  we invested huge amount of effort
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.700]  in funding with mineral nutrition is really expensive.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.140]  We didn't analyze only potassium
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.060]  in our potassium experiment.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:48.100]  We analyzed almost all micro and micronutrients
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.220]  several times during the growth period
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.860]  in separate in the roots and the leaves and the stems
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:57.380]  and the flowers and the flower leaves
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.620]  and the sugar leaves, the flower leaves.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.620]  So we have, for example,
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.260]  when we look at a different concentration of magnesium,
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.020]  for example, we can see how it affected calcium.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:12.020]  So it gives us an indication of what ranges of magnesium,
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.420]  calcium will be affected
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.220]  and what ranges of nitrogen, phosphorus may be affected.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.460]  And now based on this information,
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.620]  which was enormously difficult and expensive
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.700]  to time consuming to accumulate,
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:31.100]  it will make us easier to direct experiment
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.540]  that will study relationship between different ratios,
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.900]  between different minerals.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.940]  Can you extend on the effects of luxury feeding
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.980]  of phosphorus in the flowering stage?
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.940]  We know that many of the growers believe,
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:52.420]  I mean, it's a belief that if you use
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.260]  high conservation of phosphorus, luxury feeding,
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.780]  luxury feeding is giving more phosphorus.
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.660]  We also use luxury consumption, which is more important.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.940]  That means that not always when there is a lot
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.140]  in the root zone,
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.620]  it will mean that the plant will take up a lot.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.100]  Sometimes there's a lot high concentration in the root zone
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.540]  and the plant will not take it up, then it's less important.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.980]  But in phosphorus, we see also luxury consumption.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.580]  We saw it also for potassium.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.340]  It's very well known for potassium.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.580]  Meaning if we gave more higher concentration
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.980]  in the root zone, we had higher luxury consumption
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.660]  into the plant and higher concentration in the plant.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:36.700]  So many growers believe and will give
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.980]  very large conservations of phosphorus
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.460]  during the flowering stage
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.980]  because they believe that it affects so-called bud.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.900]  I mean, it's not a bud.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.100]  Fluorescent is not a bud.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.820]  Bud is something else, totally botanist.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.660]  I'm even hesitating to say the word,
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.060]  but they believe it will give a more denser
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.140]  and larger fluorescence.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.820]  And from our experiments, yes,
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.460]  and it's in the publication also,
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.620]  we do see that the flowers themselves,
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:04.540]  not the fluorescence,
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.500]  the flowers themselves tend up to be larger,
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.220]  but when we measure overall biomass
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:15.700]  of the yield of the fluorescence, it doesn't change.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.620]  And also when we change cannabinoids,
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.420]  they decrease and terpenoids decrease.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:26.420]  So everyone needs to do their own calculation
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.580]  of what they're interested to grow.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.940]  But in terms of yield weight, it doesn't help.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.020]  In terms of yield quantity,
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.420]  I mean, conservation of cannabinoids and terpenoids,
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.300]  it definitely damages.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.260]  So it may end up being,
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.860]  and also one thing that's important,
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.260]  the fact that it looks more denser when it's fresh
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.980]  doesn't mean that it's going to be this way
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.100]  when the tissue dries out,
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.500]  you know, the way that we dry and make your cannabis.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.740]  How many days after planting
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.620]  in the reposition rate curves study
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.140]  were the plants switched to reproduction cycle?
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.140]  Okay, so what we did is that in order to make sure
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.300]  that we get a good enough description
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.980]  of what happened in the vegetative rate of growth,
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.940]  we actually did it in two batches,
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.500]  meaning we grew the plants in the vegetative stage longer
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.100]  than what we normally would.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.580]  I can't remember offhand, I think it was 40 days
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.460]  or 45 days, something like this, or 30 days.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.580]  But, and then of course, in parallel,
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.020]  we had another group of plant
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.460]  that was switched to the reproductive stage
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.100]  as customary with the cultivation.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.220]  So we dragged the vegetative stage a little bit longer
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:43.220]  in order to see that we get a good description
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.220]  of the vegetative development.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.060]  Thanks.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.140]  Okay, why do you think N and P deprived plants
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.940]  produced more desirable compounds?
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:55.180]  So for nitrogen, I already answered this.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.420]  I said that we believe that there's a,
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.660]  our hypothesis was that there's a metabolic shift
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.660]  toward production of low nitrogen producing compounds
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.260]  such as cannabinoids in metabolic studies
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.740]  in primary and secondary metabolomic studies.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.900]  This was, we've shown this to be true.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.820]  It's a paper that we are just submitting
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.300]  for publication this week.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.180]  And for phosphorus, we can only guess.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.540]  I mean, we know that phosphorus is part of ATP.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:26.020]  So it's part of the energy budgets of the plant.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.180]  It's part of anything really.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.860]  So we don't, right now we don't have any working experiment
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:35.940]  in order to work on phosphorus
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.860]  because we are dealing with many other nutrients
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.220]  in terms of metabolomics right now,
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.340]  but it can basically be very much be
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.340]  because phosphorus is involved in so many enzymatic reactions
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.940]  and in energy utilization in the plant
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.900]  that you just shut down activity maybe.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:04.020]  So, because it, I mean, instinctively it makes sense.
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.780]  It says if there's a reduction in biomass,
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.580]  that means that the reduction in energy,
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.780]  there's a reduction in production of secondary metabolites.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.100]  It sounds logical.
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.820]  Here we received an increase.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:19.940]  So we say it's possible, it really will mean
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:24.620]  that maybe some kind of production
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:29.540]  is inhibited under deficiency
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:33.180]  more than other type of metabolic production,
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.820]  which may be causing this.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.220]  So maybe the downstream metabolic processes
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.420]  are inhibited because of phosphorus deficiency,
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.660]  which allows other metabolic processes
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.460]  to continue toward a production of terpenoids
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.340]  and cannabinoids, which share of course,
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:55.020]  partly similar metabolic processes.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.860]  And it's a good question.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.140]  And I also have to say that I'm so happy
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.500]  that we've reached the stage
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.100]  in which we can even think about it
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.260]  because now we know that this is the case.
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.380]  You know, about two years ago, three years ago,
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.580]  we had no idea.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.700]  At least now we know what the phenomenon is
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:15.420]  and it's time to start working on the mechanism
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.780]  for why this is happening.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.540]  And another question is,
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:24.500]  is research of elements showed in this presentation
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:28.780]  done on clones, meaning cuttings, or from seeds?
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:33.780]  If from seeds, was seed from seed difference affected,
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.500]  differently affected the results between the plants?
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.900]  Okay, great question.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.780]  First of all, the study was done with clones
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.700]  and it was done with clones from same mother plants.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.780]  So because the lab, in order to get the differences
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.580]  that we were able to get,
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:56.300]  that there's such very small variation between treatments,
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.660]  and between treatments,
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:02.460]  we are freaks for uniformity of cultivation conditions.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.980]  I mean, people often ask us,
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.700]  how come your standard errors are so small?
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.540]  Some of the conditions are so small for biomass
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.180]  and for height and for cannabinoids.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.860]  This is because we invest a huge amount of energy
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:19.740]  and thought and effort into making sure
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.740]  that our replicates are similar.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:27.140]  And it's come to the fact that, for example,
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.340]  we start from clones.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.820]  Obviously, if we start from seeds,
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:31.540]  probably a lot of the trends that we'll see,
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.260]  we won't be able to see because of variability.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.300]  So we start from clones, we see simple,
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.660]  same mother plants.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.620]  We start with probably about half more clones
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.500]  than we need to.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.580]  So we generate probably like twice as many clones as we need.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.100]  So at the beginning of the experiment,
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:54.740]  we can sort them for uniformity of morphology and size.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.980]  So they're very uniform when they go into the experiment,
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.980]  they don't even have one centimeter difference between them
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.860]  when they start, so this allows us.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.180]  And in the cultivation room,
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.460]  every week we go with my light meter,
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.540]  we try to eradicate every variability
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.060]  that has a large effect on the plants.
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.020]  Light obviously is one of them.
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:18.940]  So the student goes in the growing room
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:21.300]  and every week measure light intensity
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.980]  in every 20 centimeters.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:27.180]  20 centimeters, I think is maybe 15 inches, 10 inches,
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.300]  I forgot, on the grid.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.940]  And adjusting the light intensity of the reflectors
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.420]  or whatever needed to make sure
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.180]  that we have absolutely uniform conditions.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:41.700]  So this is why we are able to get very low variability
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.980]  between replicates and this wouldn't have been possible
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:46.580]  with seeds, not with the level of uniformity
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:49.860]  or lack of uniformity in genetic material
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.460]  from seeds as we have today.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.500]  When looking at individual nutrients,
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.500]  how did you supply the other necessary minerals
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.620]  for normal growth?
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.620]  This is very good question,
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.260]  a major question in mineral nutrition.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:10.380]  We have a problem in science or we're probably in the world.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.060]  It's impossible to take magnesium
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.180]  and just to add it into the solution by itself.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:19.020]  Meaning if we have a solution that's made up from nutrients,
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.740]  you cannot break the salt and add,
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:21.580]  so you have to add it.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:24.060]  It is as magnesium sulfate, magnesium nitrate,
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.180]  magnesium chloride, whatever.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.860]  And so it's difficult.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.940]  So what we do,
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.500]  we don't start with a uniform growing condition.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:34.700]  We make, before we start, we actually,
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.900]  we have recipes, we build recipes
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.900]  that make sure that we keep as much as possible
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.460]  all other nutrients uniform
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:47.580]  and change only the nutrients that we need.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.500]  In terms of magnesium, for example,
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.580]  it was possible to do it for,
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.220]  we were able to keep all nutrients constant
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.220]  because of playing with different salts
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.820]  all the way up to the fourth treatment.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.740]  For the fifth treatment,
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.900]  we had to select another ion that will increase.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.220]  And now the question is what ion do you select?
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:10.020]  And it's a major issue in mineral nutrition.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.060]  In magnesium, for example, at the fifth treatment,
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.180]  it was 140 ppm.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.980]  All the way, only at the last treatment,
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.940]  we had to add an anion, a different anion,
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.060]  and we selected to do it with sulfate,
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.100]  with sulfate, because sulfate,
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.420]  we've checked in previous experiment,
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:31.580]  it doesn't accumulate to higher concentration
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.620]  in the plant within this range.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.740]  So all of the treatment, treatment one to four,
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.820]  received, if I remember correctly, 83, I think,
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.860]  80, maybe 85, I forgot exactly, ppm.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.980]  And in the highest magnesium treatment,
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.140]  it was a bit higher.
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:51.140]  It was around, it was around 120 or 130.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.780]  This still is within the range
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:58.180]  of reasonable sulfate concentration for the plant.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.780]  And also we know from prior experiment
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.300]  that it doesn't have an effect.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.340]  It's a great question,
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.260]  and it's something that we deal with
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.500]  with mineral nutrition all the time,
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.340]  and we do the best.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.980]  That's why we don't use fertilizers.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.340]  We use salt, actually lab salt,
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:15.100]  to mix individually each one of those treatments.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.140]  And we build it the best we can
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:20.060]  to make sure that we don't deviate from,
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.060]  that's not within the range,
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.900]  that we keep as much as possible
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.500]  constant concentration of all other nutrients.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:32.220]  Did you notice in CBD, CBG plants,
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.780]  the trannic fertilizer at the optimal point
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:39.180]  would increase the THC content over 0.3%
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.300]  and herbs, phosphorus in particular, could cause this.
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:48.900]  Well, the varieties that we use,
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.420]  most of them, I mean,
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:52.580]  for some of the studies,
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:55.020]  we use the high THC variety,
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.700]  a high CBD variety,
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:00.860]  and a balanced THC-CBD varieties.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:02.700]  Most of them, but we have,
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.260]  most of them were not done with only a high THC variety
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.300]  because of the large interest that we have in Israel.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.900]  And in Israel, we don't have the 0.3 restriction
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.020]  because all our cultivation has to be done
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.420]  in greenhouses and indoor.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:20.380]  Nothing is in the field.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:24.180]  We're not allowed to grow because of scares,
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.140]  worries about contamination from the soil.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.140]  It all has to be soilless cultivation
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:33.140]  in greenhouses or in growth chambers or indoor.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.540]  So I don't have a very good answer
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.620]  about CBD-only variety.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.940]  They don't have a THC.
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.860]  But from the varieties that we have,
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.820]  from the balanced varieties
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:48.740]  and from throughout the experiment that we have,
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:50.620]  we noticed that, I mean,
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:54.300]  at least for the effect on phosphorus,
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.860]  the highest concentration we received
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:01.140]  under phosphorus deficiency.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.260]  So this was true for CBD concentration,
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.540]  for THC concentration, for CBG concentration,
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.380]  for all of them.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.740]  So actually the highest concentration were under deficiency.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.500]  And the more we increased phosphorus,
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.220]  all those, the concentration of all this reduced.
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:18.340]  So no, we didn't find an increase in THC
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.500]  with an increase in phosphorus.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.060]  The opposite was actually true.
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.860]  Could growers implement a targeted NPT restriction
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:32.780]  near the end of the reproductive phase
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.060]  to achieve similar levels
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:38.700]  of increased secondary metabolite concentration?
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.980]  Or does the nutrient stress need to happen
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.620]  over the entire lifespan?
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:44.420]  Great questions.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.780]  We are dealing with flushing, right?
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.820]  Just to tell you that we are actually finished writing
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.620]  a manuscript about flushing.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:55.220]  We didn't have time to load it again.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.460]  For whoever is maybe not familiar with this,
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.820]  most growers, most growers at the last week
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:09.300]  or week and a half, 10 days or week of cultivation,
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.700]  some use different durations,
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:15.180]  either completely stop giving fertilizers.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.100]  So they give just water or reduce some of the fertilizer.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:23.180]  This is called term flushing in the cannabis jargon.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:28.820]  And the question is here, can we, it's very logical.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:32.620]  It says, can we just give nutrients, whatever we need,
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.260]  but just do flushing at the end,
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.220]  and this will replace the need
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.740]  for to give deficiency concentration.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.940]  So first of all, I would have to say
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.380]  that all our studies were done with flushing.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.620]  I mean, many of them we've done because we didn't,
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.460]  we asked ourselves the same question.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.420]  We did actually double the amount of plants
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.060]  and we did half of them with flush
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.660]  and half of them we didn't flush.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:58.060]  And those that, the flushing versus non-flushing
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.980]  will come up in a different experiment,
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.460]  in a different study.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.100]  In other words, no, it doesn't help.
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.500]  And the reason is that,
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.700]  the reason is that the production of secondary metabolite
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:12.180]  doesn't start at the last week of cultivation.
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:15.340]  It's a process, throughout several weeks before it.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.780]  So probably this is what they affecting.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.500]  And also it's probably a matter of overall energy balance
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.340]  and availability in the plant.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.580]  So, but this is again, these are all issues of when,
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.500]  I mean, not necessarily during the last week of flushing,
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.860]  but can we give it at the last half of the cultivation?
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.260]  Can we give it the center of the cultivation?
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.740]  All these questions that need to be worked out.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:42.220]  And these are definitely questions that we will need to,
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.020]  work about, it's very important to work about them.
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.980]  What are the best journals for getting primary literature
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.500]  on cannabis cultivation?
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:01.660]  Well, if the question is about scientific journals
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:05.460]  and I'm going to ask answer with scientific journals,
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:08.220]  then I think that the,
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.340]  I think that the publications,
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.420]  scientific publication about cannabis
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.700]  have been published in many journals.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.140]  I mean, in many journals,
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:23.260]  there are two journals which are specific for cannabis
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.580]  or actually three, the third one that was initiated,
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.540]  but not necessarily these studies will be done there.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.620]  And we see it cannabis cultivation anywhere.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.540]  I don't even want to name names of journal
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.620]  because really it can be found anywhere.
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.220]  The question is, are they available to the public or not?
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.060]  Some of those will be open access,
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.620]  meaning that you can just punch in
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.900]  and download the PDF with them.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.180]  And some of them will be accessed only through libraries
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.660]  or through paying directly to the publisher.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:53.460]  So the best way is not to search, to my opinion,
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.500]  not to search specific journals,
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.900]  but what we do in science is to search keywords.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.300]  I mean, if someone doesn't have access
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.020]  to scientific databases,
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.460]  they just use Google and write cannabis, nitrogen,
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:09.460]  cannabis, phosphorus, cannabis, nutrition, so on.
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:14.060]  And this will direct in addition to the non-scientific
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.500]  or look in Google Scholar,
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.060]  then it will direct to scientific publications
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.180]  that dealing with whatever issues of interest.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.300]  Are you doing any CO2 enrichment studies
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.060]  under enhanced CO2?
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.500]  Would you expect greater nutrient demand?
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.380]  Okay, that's a great question.
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:40.980]  We didn't do any CO2 enhancement studies.
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.860]  There are several reasons to them.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.540]  One of them, we're trying to mimic
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.900]  also greenhouse cultivation,
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:52.660]  but all our rooms have very good,
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.660]  I mean, very good ventilation.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.540]  So we are working under ambient CO2.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.500]  It never goes below CO2,
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.900]  but it never goes below ambient CO2 concentrations.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.220]  So in other words,
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.940]  concentration in our growing room
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.020]  are identical to the concentration,
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.940]  which are outside because of the way
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:17.420]  that the replacement of air circulation
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.060]  in the growing rooms.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:25.580]  And is it going to affect mineral uptake?
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:27.820]  I think the answer is that
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.740]  if it's going to affect growth rate,
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.740]  then it's going to affect mineral uptake
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.980]  because minerals are needed for growth.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.900]  If we need more leaves to be produced,
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.820]  then we need more nitrogen for protein.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.100]  We need more calcium for cell wall, for example.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.420]  This is very simplistic.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.820]  So if there'll be more growth,
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.020]  there'll be more need for nutrients.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:50.660]  On top of this, it may have,
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.660]  CO2 enrichment, of course,
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:58.700]  may have an effect on specific processes,
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:00.780]  metabolic or others in the plant,
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:04.180]  which may theoretically affect need for nutrients
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:07.780]  and then potentially mineral uptake.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.020]  This is when working on, of course,
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.180]  CO2 will affect photosynthesis,
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.460]  which will affect energy,
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.580]  I mean, carbohydrate,
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:20.140]  CO2 fixation and carbohydrate availability.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.260]  All this can have an effect,
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.940]  but whether it goes above
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.540]  affecting specific growth processes,
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.820]  it's something that needs to be investigated.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.100]  Do you expect the results,
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.980]  Louis, if we are over time
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.100]  and you need to stop us, then stop us, okay?
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.020]  I have no problem,
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.220]  like I have the freedom of extending this as long as I can,
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:43.460]  as long as we get to all the questions.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.300]  Okay.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:46.860]  Okay.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.940]  Do we expect the results,
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.140]  do we expect the result to be consistent
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.900]  across different growing media?
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.140]  Okay, the question is, what is the result?
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.260]  I mean, the result that we were shooting for
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.780]  that we were receiving
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.140]  is the effect of different concentration
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:06.580]  in the root zone on plant function,
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:09.940]  because the way that those nutrients were done
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:14.940]  is with a media that's as inert as possible,
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:17.060]  enough leaching so we don't build up
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:18.180]  concentration of the plant,
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.060]  so which allows us to really focus
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:21.860]  on the response of the plant
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:23.300]  to a steady concentration,
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:27.780]  to a uniform concentration in the nutrient solution.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.660]  Now, what happens if we use different growing media?
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.820]  So we know, of course,
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:32.660]  that many of the,
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:37.380]  in Israel, a growing number of cultivators
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.340]  is using perlite,
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.980]  but most cultivators, of course,
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.740]  is using media rich with organic media.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.060]  The main difference will be,
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:47.620]  one of the differences will be
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.660]  that the nutrients will be stored
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.900]  to the media.
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.820]  So if the media is less inert,
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.500]  then we have sorption and desorption
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.100]  of the nutrient.
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:01.140]  They can build up to higher concentration.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.780]  That means, on one hand,
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.300]  we will need to supply more
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.460]  to overcome whatever is remained
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.780]  in the media,
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.780]  is sorbed to the media.
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.620]  And on the other hand,
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:14.260]  there's a possibility for the media to release.
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.820]  So the way to do it,
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.580]  and this is the same as asking
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:20.100]  when we grow tomatoes in heavy soils
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.060]  or in sandy soil,
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.300]  will the response be different?
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.580]  The plant itself, in large,
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.140]  is going to behave similarly,
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.740]  other than the fact that the media
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:32.100]  can affect the root development
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.700]  and morphology and so on.
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.700]  But the plant itself is going to respond differently.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.220]  We just need to account
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:40.060]  for different interactions
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:42.740]  with the media itself.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.460]  But the first thing is to understand
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.220]  what the plant needs,
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.300]  what the plant takes up every week,
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.340]  how does it respond
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.020]  when we supply this and that concentration?
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:53.020]  And then we need,
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.740]  and after having this understanding,
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.500]  then it needs to be adjusted
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.140]  to different growing media
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:03.140]  or different soils for other crops.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.140]  Another question,
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:09.940]  have you ever analyzed petrochem products?
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.220]  Do you think if they are really standardized
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:16.420]  since that is their marketing pitch?
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.260]  And we all know that in Canada,
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.700]  they were not standardized.
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:21.660]  Thank you.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.180]  I have never analyzed petrochem products.
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.020]  I don't know.
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.820]  Are your paper open source?
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.100]  I try my best.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:36.340]  I mean, let's say that if I'm a researcher
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:39.900]  at Vulcanic Center over 30 years now,
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.020]  and before cannabis,
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.060]  I mean, the criteria for selection
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.180]  of journals might've been different,
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.500]  but with cannabis,
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.580]  I feel kind of a public responsibility
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.860]  because I know that so many people
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.300]  are interested in those data.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:56.820]  I do my best to publish them open access
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:59.220]  and most large,
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:02.020]  really large percentage of those publication
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.140]  are published in a open access journals.
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.380]  Several of them are not.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.900]  And I always tell people
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.740]  that if they come across something
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.020]  that it's not available to them,
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:13.140]  please feel free to contact us
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.900]  and we'll be happy to share those publication.
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.620]  But I think that about 80% of our publication,
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.860]  we pay huge sum for open access
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.060]  or actually some of the journals,
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.380]  many of them contact us.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.380]  They really want to publish those publications.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.300]  So we get them open access for free depending
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.700]  because we know that there is a huge interest
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.260]  in the publication.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:36.780]  We're sometimes amazed by,
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.380]  those journals published in them
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.900]  and we look at the paper a day later
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:42.860]  or two day later,
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.140]  it's with thousands of people that downloaded them
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:45.980]  and looked at them.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.540]  So we know that it's important
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:51.380]  to let people have access to those,
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:54.500]  to have access to those journals also
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:59.500]  to people that don't have access to scientific library.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.940]  Are there any plans to perform deficiency studies
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.540]  based on leaf tissue testing
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.820]  to account for growers
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.260]  who are not growing in inert media?
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.740]  Wow, that's a,
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.380]  okay, I'm telling you all my secrets, that's okay.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.100]  I have to tell you that in all of the study,
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.780]  the question for those,
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:25.300]  just to explain this, how important this question is.
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.300]  The question is really asking about
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.420]  evaluating what the plant,
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.820]  what the nutritional status of the plant
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:39.140]  based on analyzing leaf concentrations.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.300]  So we call this an agronomy,
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.060]  we call this representative leaf.
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:46.180]  What does that mean?
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.100]  That we identify on a plant,
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.380]  it can be a basil plant, a tomato plant, pepper plant,
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:54.060]  we identify what's called a representative leaf.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.980]  A leaf that in every stage in a growing cycle,
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.260]  we can go to it and sample it
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:01.540]  and we know what concentration to expect
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:04.140]  if the plant is under optimal condition.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:08.020]  So developing those tables of representative leaves
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:10.660]  are a great way of assisting,
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:17.260]  assisting growers that want to know what their situation is,
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:19.140]  is to create those tables that say,
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.380]  in this stage of growth,
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.060]  this is what you expect in the leaves,
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:23.660]  nitrogen, potassium, sodium.
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:25.460]  In the flowering stage,
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.460]  this is what you expect in the leaf.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:31.860]  So developing a concentration in the representative leaf
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:33.300]  is very critical.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.940]  What I want to tell you is that in all of the experiment
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.260]  that we conducted in the lab,
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.340]  all of the experiment,
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:42.860]  in addition to analyzing concentration in leaf root shoot,
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:45.660]  we also sampled representative leaves
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:49.220]  from hundreds, thousands of samples.
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.900]  And now after we finished this,
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:52.860]  actually all the students,
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.860]  those that left the lab,
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:54.700]  that didn't left the lab,
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.660]  got together the last couple of months,
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:57.740]  the last two months,
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.540]  we finished analyzing all the leaves
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.300]  and actually we are in the final process
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.620]  of putting those tables together
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:06.580]  and they will be published soon.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.500]  So it will give us,
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.580]  actually we are generating with this,
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:11.700]  it is for every,
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.700]  it will be separate for the vegetative stage,
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.820]  a separate for the reproductive stage.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:16.740]  And based on the fact,
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.020]  concentration of nitrogen,
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.020]  we know under optimum condition,
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:20.860]  what it should be.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.340]  And this will be a first step
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.180]  into generating those concentration,
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:30.060]  optimal concentration for a cultivation.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.260]  And I think that the other people
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:33.660]  are working on this as well.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.820]  This is very important.
[01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.330]  Okay.
[01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:40.530]  Have you investigated the accumulation
[01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:43.370]  of heavy metals and inflorescence?
[01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:45.010]  Gosh, every one of those questions,
[01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:45.850]  I have to say, yes,
[01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:47.330]  it's in the process.
[01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:50.650]  So I have to tell you that this is a issue
[01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:54.010]  that's major concern because,
[01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:57.770]  major concern because cannabis is considered to be,
[01:27:57.930 --> 01:28:02.730]  if a plant can be used for bioremediation,
[01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:04.610]  meaning some plants can take up,
[01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:06.290]  they have a tendency to take up
[01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:08.090]  high concentration of heavy metals
[01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:09.850]  and other contaminants as well,
[01:28:09.850 --> 01:28:11.410]  and to survive it well.
[01:28:11.410 --> 01:28:13.410]  Up to the point that it's considered to be used
[01:28:13.410 --> 01:28:15.250]  even for cleaning soils.
[01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:16.970]  To cleaning soil and hemp
[01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:18.410]  is considered to be a plant
[01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:20.490]  that's good for heavy remediation.
[01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:22.210]  This is one of the reason, by the way,
[01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:24.930]  that when we're thinking about contamination,
[01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:25.770]  that in Israel,
[01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:28.410]  only allowed to cultivate cannabis
[01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:30.610]  under soil is cultivation.
[01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:33.450]  And we have to test, by law,
[01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:36.410]  we have to test the concentration of everything,
[01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:38.690]  microbial, heavy metals,
[01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:41.650]  a huge number of chemicals in the soil
[01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.050]  before we even plant.
[01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:45.530]  We plant the plants, this is by law.
[01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:47.650]  But so we were concerned about it
[01:28:47.650 --> 01:28:51.090]  because normally in those soil is the media
[01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:51.930]  is being used,
[01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:54.170]  there's not that many heavy metals,
[01:28:54.210 --> 01:28:56.730]  but even some of our micronutrients
[01:28:56.730 --> 01:29:00.410]  such as zinc and copper and iron,
[01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:02.250]  they're heavy metals.
[01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.970]  So we were considering what happens,
[01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:08.170]  do they accumulate only in the root?
[01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:09.130]  Are they in the stem?
[01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:09.970]  Are they in the leaves?
[01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.770]  Do they accumulate in the inflorescence?
[01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:14.930]  And actually Tamar, a master student in the lab
[01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:16.850]  is working on this issue.
[01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:19.330]  We did two things, we just completed,
[01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:20.690]  I'm telling you all the secrets again,
[01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:22.330]  we just, it's not secrets.
[01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:26.130]  We just completed a study in which we gave the plant
[01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:28.650]  different mixes of different heavy metals
[01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:31.090]  and we are analyzing to see how much of it
[01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:34.130]  actually arrives into the inflorescence.
[01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:35.570]  One thing that I can already say,
[01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:37.050]  and this is not from this experiment,
[01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:40.330]  this is from data that you can look in our publications.
[01:29:40.330 --> 01:29:42.130]  If you look at our publication,
[01:29:42.130 --> 01:29:45.970]  because we analyzed micronutrients in all of this,
[01:29:45.970 --> 01:29:49.090]  so we can see where in the plant
[01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:53.970]  our zinc and manganese and copper and iron accumulate.
[01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:57.090]  And what we can see that many of those heavy metals,
[01:29:57.090 --> 01:30:01.610]  luckily, we retain in high concentrations in the roots.
[01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:03.930]  So they do move to the inflorescence,
[01:30:03.930 --> 01:30:07.250]  but under, we see higher accumulation
[01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.530]  and deposition in the roots
[01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:13.890]  and sometimes lower root to shoot translocation.
[01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:16.250]  Whether this is true also under high,
[01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:18.930]  specifically high concentration of heavy metals,
[01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:20.770]  this remains to be seen.
[01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:23.890]  Okay, the last question is,
[01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:28.610]  I know that hemp can control weeds effectively.
[01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:30.610]  Do you think it would be appropriate
[01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:32.290]  to use it as a copper crop?
[01:30:35.050 --> 01:30:36.210]  I don't know.
[01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:40.450]  I don't have an experience with hemp
[01:30:40.450 --> 01:30:42.490]  cultivated in the field.
[01:30:43.450 --> 01:30:46.690]  I have very little experiment with hemp cultivated in soil
[01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:48.250]  and I have no idea.
[01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:51.410]  It will also be an issue, I think, legal issue of,
[01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:54.650]  I don't know, but I really don't know.
[01:30:56.930 --> 01:30:58.930]  I think that that was the last question.
[01:30:58.930 --> 01:30:59.930]  That was the last question.
[01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:03.010]  I can just say quickly that there are some,
[01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:04.170]  there's a professor at Cornell
[01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:06.570]  that is working on that, copper crops,
[01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:08.090]  using hemp as a copper crop.
[01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:10.930]  So that research is coming up.
[01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:13.730]  Well, thank you so much, Dr. Bernstein.
[01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:16.890]  Thank you so much for all of you to attend
[01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:18.930]  and be interested in sticking along
[01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:21.090]  for the extra 30 minutes.
[01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:22.290]  I really appreciate it.
[01:31:22.290 --> 01:31:23.130]  It was very informative.
[01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:25.130]  Certainly there were a lot of questions this time.
[01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:27.010]  So that's great.
[01:31:28.330 --> 01:31:33.010]  So just next time in two weeks, actually on March 8th,
[01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:35.450]  please join us for our fourth seminar
[01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:38.290]  on outdoor cultivation and nutrient management
[01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:41.370]  by Dr. Heather Darby of the University of Vermont.
[01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:44.370]  So I will see you all in two weeks.
[01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:45.290]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:47.330]  Thank you very much.
[01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:50.490]  And thank you, Luis, for inviting me to the talk.
[01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:51.690]  It's always a pleasure.
[01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:59.330]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[01:31:59.330 --> 01:32:02.170]  on the web at cornell.edu.
