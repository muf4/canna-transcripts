[00:00.000 --> 00:16.160]  My name is Don Vines. I'm a professor in plant breeding and genetics in the School of Integrative
[00:16.160 --> 00:21.060]  Plant Sciences here at Cornell. And we've put together a program for our first hemp
[00:21.060 --> 00:27.440]  field day ever, where fortunately we have some nice looking hemp for you to be able
[00:27.440 --> 00:31.280]  to see. And I noticed everybody was kind of roaming around looking at it, and you'll have
[00:31.280 --> 00:36.400]  opportunity to do that a little bit later on as well. But we have a lineup of some of
[00:36.400 --> 00:40.400]  us here from Cornell who are working with hemp, and we have quite a few people and a
[00:40.400 --> 00:44.440]  number of people are growing who are interested in working on different aspects of hemp in
[00:44.440 --> 00:51.440]  terms of research and extension. And we also have Chris Loge, who I'm not sure he's here
[00:51.440 --> 00:55.640]  yet, but oh there he is, wonderful. He's from the Department of Agriculture and Markets
[00:55.640 --> 01:01.260]  who is going to be talking a little bit later on about the potential uses, the marketing
[01:01.260 --> 01:07.100]  of hemp and also some of the regulatory issues that growers need to keep in mind. I noticed
[01:07.100 --> 01:13.340]  that looking at the list of all of you who have signed up or enrolled online for this
[01:13.340 --> 01:18.380]  field day, that there's a wide variety of backgrounds that you come from and interests
[01:18.380 --> 01:24.500]  that you have about hemp. So what I would like to do is to keep this informal. Certainly
[01:24.500 --> 01:29.980]  there are a half a dozen or so of us who are going to be giving talks, but to keep it informal
[01:29.980 --> 01:36.340]  such that as you have questions or even comments or want to get into discussion about anything,
[01:36.340 --> 01:42.380]  just barge in at any time to do that. So it would be more fun if this was more of a two-way
[01:42.380 --> 01:48.460]  discussion or a multiple-way discussion than if it's just us up here lecturing to you.
[01:48.460 --> 01:55.460]  So keep that in mind. We also have Assemblywoman Donna Lepardo who is somewhere close by, but
[01:56.380 --> 02:01.100]  I don't think she's here. There she is! Oh wonderful! So she's just waving her hand there.
[02:01.100 --> 02:07.620]  I wanted to recognize her because she is the one who initiated all of the discussions about
[02:07.620 --> 02:13.700]  industrial hemp and the potential uses here in New York State and the subsequent legislation
[02:13.700 --> 02:18.740]  and essentially paved the way for us to be able to, I mean without her we wouldn't be
[02:18.740 --> 02:22.660]  having this field day right now essentially. So let's give her a round of applause for
[02:22.780 --> 02:31.680]  what she's done. And certainly any time that you want to contribute to the discussion,
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.760]  feel free to jump right on in. So again we'll keep this very informal. So what I'd like to do
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.400]  is to start out by just telling you how we got into this research here at Cornell University
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.320]  in the first place. And it started last year with the Department of Agriculture and Markets
[02:47.320 --> 02:55.120]  who made some funding available to us to start out by evaluating varieties of industrial hemp
[02:55.120 --> 03:00.840]  that come from Canada and Europe by and large. And to see which ones will perform the best under
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.320]  our conditions in New York State until we have time to actually do some breeding specifically
[03:05.320 --> 03:10.800]  for New York State conditions. So that's what this set of trials is all about here. There are
[03:10.800 --> 03:15.560]  a couple of people who will explain more about this a little while from now so I won't try to
[03:15.560 --> 03:22.080]  steal their thunder. But by the time we went through all the the regulatory approval process
[03:22.080 --> 03:28.400]  that had to be done in tandem, we couldn't do it all at the same time, it wasn't until late August
[03:28.400 --> 03:34.560]  of last year that we were able to actually purchase some seed. And obviously that's too late to get
[03:34.560 --> 03:40.800]  some good experiments going. But my research crew planted out some small trials only about a mile
[03:40.800 --> 03:47.040]  in that direction from here at the first of September last year. Not to really get good data
[03:47.160 --> 03:52.720]  on harvest, I mean by the time that froze sometime in November it was only about six or eight inches
[03:52.720 --> 03:59.600]  tall. But at least it gave us a chance to to see how well we could establish some experiments. They
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.120]  actually tried out two different planters and got some good data. So we have a little experience
[04:04.120 --> 04:09.880]  behind us before doing the real trials this summer. And you can see behind me that that it was very
[04:09.880 --> 04:16.400]  successful in establishing a good trial there. So that's what last year was all about. But what I'd
[04:16.400 --> 04:24.720]  like to do is to turn this over to Dr. Chris Smart to describe more of what the research plans are
[04:24.720 --> 04:29.520]  for us here at Cornell. And not only what we're doing now, but what we plan to do in the future.
[04:29.520 --> 04:36.960]  And what's happening in terms of production around the state in regards to research. Chris is a
[04:36.960 --> 04:43.360]  professor in the section of plant pathology and plant microbiology in the School of Integrated
[04:43.360 --> 04:49.040]  Plant Science. And she's the one who's coordinating all that we're doing here with Industrial Hemp in our
[04:49.040 --> 04:55.360]  college. And on top of that she's also a director. I know you're interim director, but essentially you're a director.
[04:55.360 --> 05:02.960]  Today is the day. Oh wow. So she is a director of the School of Integrated Plant Science.
[05:02.960 --> 05:12.880]  Well thank you Don and welcome everyone to Cornell. It is a beautiful day and this is a really
[05:12.880 --> 05:20.320]  remarkable hemp trial. Don and his crew have done a great job. In terms of the research that we're doing here,
[05:20.320 --> 05:27.440]  we now at Cornell, well let me give you a bit of a history. Last year in 2016 there were 15 or 16 states
[05:27.440 --> 05:34.080]  across the US that had industrial hemp research projects. This year, and Don's group was one of them.
[05:34.080 --> 05:41.280]  It was really fantastic that he was. This year there's 31 states. So industrial hemp is booming and we have a lot of
[05:41.280 --> 05:48.240]  folks to collaborate with across the country. So it's really nice that the state has enabled us to jump in and
[05:48.240 --> 05:55.440]  really get on the wave of industrial hemp that's happening right now. In terms of what we're doing, we now have
[05:55.440 --> 06:03.680]  11 scientists at Cornell that they and folks in their labs have projects on industrial hemp. Last year this time we had one.
[06:04.400 --> 06:12.720]  So the state has definitely got us enthusiastic about industrial hemp. We also have 10 educators from Cornell
[06:12.720 --> 06:20.640]  Cooperative Extension across the state that are involved in bringing information to growers about how to grow hemp
[06:20.640 --> 06:27.680]  and what can we do this year in terms of hemp and where are we looking to the future. So that's really exciting.
[06:28.000 --> 06:36.000]  In terms of some of the research that we'll be doing, there is a research project actually that is run through Cornell
[06:36.000 --> 06:43.840]  but it's actually a state funded project where this year there are 29 farms that are involved in the research project.
[06:43.840 --> 06:52.000]  These are farms that are all growing the same variety of industrial hemp. That variety is Anka. The reason we chose Anka
[06:52.080 --> 07:03.680]  was not some amazing scientific literature driven reason. It's really the seed that we could get a hold of at the time we decided to do this large scale project.
[07:03.680 --> 07:12.000]  But it is a dual purpose variety of hemp so it'll be interesting to see how it does on these 29 different farms.
[07:12.000 --> 07:20.480]  In terms of the research, we know what the history of the land that Anka is being grown on. We know we have soil tests and
[07:20.960 --> 07:30.720]  we'll have weather data, we'll have yield data so we'll know really how this variety does. We have farms from Lake Erie all the way down to Long Island.
[07:30.720 --> 07:41.280]  Growers are amazingly entrepreneurial. We have growers that are growing for fiber and for seed. We also have growers that are growing plants in the greenhouse
[07:41.280 --> 07:52.480]  and transplanting them out to extract the medicinal compounds, the non-hallucinogenic, non-THC medicinal compounds and they'll be selling those.
[07:52.480 --> 08:00.800]  And then we have growers that are actually harvesting 2-3 week old plants and using them for baby greens in salads and whatnot.
[08:00.800 --> 08:08.480]  So I've been amazingly impressed again continually by the growers in the state of New York, how entrepreneurial you folks are
[08:08.720 --> 08:15.760]  and all the different uses and creative ways that you can find to thrive in this farming environment.
[08:15.760 --> 08:24.320]  It has been a tough year. We've had a lot of water. My background is in plant pathology. I study diseases of vegetables.
[08:24.320 --> 08:28.480]  And if you're a vegetable grower you know it's been a tough year. It's been hard to get in because of all the rain.
[08:28.480 --> 08:36.320]  But our growers have gotten the hemp in. It's gotten in late and we'll be enthusiastic to see what we learn at the end of the season.
[08:37.120 --> 08:46.160]  In terms of other research projects, Larry Smart who's a plant breeder in the School of Integrative Plant Science as well,
[08:46.160 --> 08:50.080]  he and Don Vines are going to be establishing a breeding program.
[08:50.080 --> 08:59.120]  One of the things that we learned this year, Don's group knew last year, is that because of the permitting issues that Chris Logue will talk about,
[08:59.440 --> 09:04.400]  moving seed across state or country lines can be extremely difficult.
[09:04.400 --> 09:12.320]  And so it would be really great to establish a seed production industry here in New York so that New York growers can buy seed produced in New York,
[09:12.320 --> 09:17.200]  alleviating some of the permitting issues. And that will be coming online.
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.840]  But just starting a breeding program from scratch takes time.
[09:22.080 --> 09:32.080]  And so we're also working with local seed companies to try to find ways to import the seed more smoothly than what happened this year.
[09:32.080 --> 09:40.160]  Additionally, in that program we will be establishing a THC and CBD.
[09:40.160 --> 09:45.200]  CBDs are the non-hallucinogenic compounds, medicinal compounds produced by hemp.
[09:45.520 --> 09:59.680]  A testing facility that hopefully a year from now both researchers and growers will be able to use to determine what varieties have higher levels of those medicinal compounds when grown here in New York.
[09:59.680 --> 10:05.440]  So those compounds do change depending on the environment, depending on water content, and depending on heat.
[10:05.440 --> 10:08.480]  So that's going to be an important aspect of our program.
[10:09.200 --> 10:12.720]  We have a plant pathologist that's going to be studying plant diseases.
[10:12.720 --> 10:15.120]  We have an entomologist that's looking at insects.
[10:15.120 --> 10:20.320]  We have a system scientist who's looking at how hemp fits into a rotational system.
[10:21.120 --> 10:26.880]  We have also, I along with a microbiologist, are looking at the microbiome.
[10:26.880 --> 10:32.480]  You've heard that what's in your gut and on your skin helps make you who you are, healthy and things like that.
[10:32.480 --> 10:41.440]  Well, we're actually going to be looking at the microbiome of hemp to see what kind of microbes grow on hemp and how that might impact some of the products that we get out of it.
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.080]  So that's some of the research that we're going to be doing at Cornell.
[10:46.960 --> 11:02.000]  And we're really excited actually just to be involved with the growers and to learn from you guys what your needs are, but also what you're learning on your farms and how we can bring that back and feed those questions and those solutions into our research program.
[11:02.560 --> 11:11.760]  I also want to say that we do have a field day in Geneva on Tuesday, August 15th.
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.960]  So the Geneva plots, we have, Cornell has a campus in Geneva, it's about an hour north of here.
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.200]  So we have four trials here that Don's group will talk about today.
[11:21.200 --> 11:23.920]  We have two identical trials to these four in Geneva.
[11:23.920 --> 11:28.080]  And those trials don't look quite like this.
[11:28.560 --> 11:35.280]  So when we're in Geneva, we'll actually be talking about some of the struggles that you might have if you're planting a hemp crop.
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.480]  This is beautiful.
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.840]  As I've heard, some of the researchers are like, wow, if I knew it was going to look like this, I'd grow it in a heartbeat.
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.280]  But what happens when a field gets drowned out?
[11:47.280 --> 11:48.320]  What do things look like?
[11:48.320 --> 11:51.680]  What disease and insect prectures do you have and things like that?
[11:52.480 --> 12:00.320]  So we'll have some of the extension folks there and we'll talk about some of the issues that you could have if you're growing a hemp crop.
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.000]  And with that, I think I would turn it over to your folks.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.040]  Back to Don.
[12:05.040 --> 12:13.840]  Some of you who have stood up close to the hemp here may have noticed that these grain varieties here that are in bloom, there's a lot of bees in there.
[12:13.840 --> 12:15.520]  Bumble bees and honey bees and so forth.
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.400]  They're really doing a lot of pollinating and a lot of hemp for the pollen source.
[12:21.120 --> 12:38.560]  I also was thinking as I came out this morning and I was looking not straight in this way, but from the other direction, this stand is so thick that you could easily use this for, you know, like to have corn mazes and stuff like that, the pathways.
[12:38.560 --> 12:46.000]  So maybe once the regulations allow for that to happen, we could have hemp mazes.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.560]  We'll see what happens in the future.
[12:48.720 --> 12:59.440]  Next up, we're going to have a couple of people from our research program talk about the actual trials that are going on here to evaluate varieties for our conditions here in New York State.
[12:59.440 --> 13:02.640]  So I'd like to introduce two people to come up.
[13:02.640 --> 13:12.800]  Jamie Crawford, who I really have to acknowledge has done a lot of work to make the logistics of all of these things that we're doing with hemp happen.
[13:12.800 --> 13:16.960]  She's been very instrumental to pulling off a lot of things there.
[13:17.360 --> 13:25.760]  So Jamie is a research support specialist on the Forage Breeding Project, which is the project that I lead, but of course now we're into hemp research as well.
[13:25.760 --> 13:33.120]  And along with her is Amelia Yaffe, who is actually completing an internship with us.
[13:33.120 --> 13:40.560]  She's actually from SUNY Cobleskill and has to do an internship in order to complete her degree requirements there at Cobleskill.
[13:40.880 --> 13:50.800]  So she became interested in industrial hemp and we took her on as an intern to work with the hemp project this summer and has done a lot of really nice things there.
[13:50.800 --> 13:52.800]  So I'm going to turn it over to the two of them.
[13:52.800 --> 13:54.800]  Good morning.
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.160]  I have a bunch of things to tell you and I knew I'd forget, so you have actually a handout for what I'm going to talk about.
[14:00.160 --> 14:03.120]  It's called 2017 Industrial Hemp Trials.
[14:04.080 --> 14:11.600]  So the very first table on that sheet shows you our different locations for our trials and the planting dates.
[14:11.600 --> 14:18.000]  So the trial you see behind me right here, this one was planted June 9th.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.280]  And you can see it's done very, very well.
[14:23.280 --> 14:29.360]  The one directly behind me, this is our grain and dual purpose variety trial.
[14:29.680 --> 14:37.520]  And then we also had four entries that are exclusive fiber varieties and so those are the next block down.
[14:37.520 --> 14:41.200]  So those of you interested in fiber should go and check those out as well.
[14:41.200 --> 14:49.200]  So you can see we planted, well Chris had mentioned how far behind the trials were in Geneva.
[14:49.200 --> 14:51.200]  They were planted later.
[14:51.200 --> 14:57.680]  So we planted a second trial on this exact same soil type the day after we planted the first Geneva trial.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.480]  And that is what's down at the far end.
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.960]  So you could be able to see a little bit of a difference, a difference three weeks can make.
[15:06.800 --> 15:09.920]  The varieties are still photo period sensitive.
[15:09.920 --> 15:15.680]  So you can see that even though they are much shorter, they're still starting to flower at about the same time.
[15:17.040 --> 15:24.400]  Within the last two weeks, luckily we've had two people from different Canadian seed companies come and visit us.
[15:24.480 --> 15:32.480]  And they've said that even though it's planted later, it will still be harvested in, like, let's see.
[15:32.480 --> 15:38.720]  So since there's a three week difference in planting, there'll probably be a week and a half difference in harvesting time.
[15:38.720 --> 15:44.720]  So it's not going to be, you know, it's not the full three week difference for the harvest.
[15:45.840 --> 15:48.880]  So you can see our other trials on here.
[15:48.960 --> 15:50.960]  So we have one other trial here in Ithaca.
[15:50.960 --> 15:55.440]  That was planted on what I would call a challenging soil.
[15:55.440 --> 15:59.280]  So it's what we planted, we planted a trial on it last year.
[15:59.280 --> 16:04.080]  And what we planted with a grain drill, so it was planted about a one inch seeding depth.
[16:04.080 --> 16:05.520]  It just didn't come up at all.
[16:05.520 --> 16:06.480]  It was terrible.
[16:06.480 --> 16:13.840]  So we planted it this year with a forage seeder aiming for about a half inch seeding depth.
[16:13.840 --> 16:17.680]  And then bad luck, right?
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.200]  About two days after we planted it, we got a rain and then two nights in the 40s.
[16:24.160 --> 16:30.560]  And so the emergence in that field is not what you see here.
[16:32.240 --> 16:33.680]  It's sort of an understatement.
[16:34.400 --> 16:43.600]  In the trial right behind me, we're averaging between 10 and 18 seedlings per square foot.
[16:43.600 --> 16:48.480]  And on that other trial I was just talking about, we were averaging between four and
[16:48.480 --> 16:50.480]  seven seedlings per square foot.
[16:50.480 --> 16:52.800]  So it was a big difference, a big difference.
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.440]  And then we have the two trials planted in Geneva, one of them on a moderately well-drained
[16:59.440 --> 17:02.400]  soil and one on a somewhat poorly-drained soil.
[17:02.400 --> 17:04.320]  So we know we have those in New York State.
[17:05.040 --> 17:10.400]  And then our last trial is on a gravel, it's the only one that had a lot of rocks.
[17:10.400 --> 17:16.640]  So our last trial was planted in an organic system in Freeville.
[17:16.640 --> 17:22.560]  And so that was rotating out of red clover and then we planted hemp into it.
[17:22.560 --> 17:25.520]  So we're really looking forward to what we see in that one.
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.560]  So the plots behind me, each one is, well, this is sort of the joke.
[17:30.560 --> 17:33.760]  Some of the students pointed it out to me after I printed out the...
[17:33.760 --> 17:36.320]  So our plots are four feet by 20 feet.
[17:36.320 --> 17:39.600]  So everyone can make a 420 joke there.
[17:39.600 --> 17:42.160]  You have to have one at a hemp meeting, right?
[17:42.960 --> 17:49.520]  So, and then each entry is replicated four times throughout each trial.
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.160]  Like I said, we were aiming for their grain drill for about three quarters of an inch
[17:56.160 --> 18:00.640]  for a seeding depth in all of our trials, except for the East Ithaca one, where we aim
[18:00.640 --> 18:01.600]  for a half an inch.
[18:02.320 --> 18:09.600]  And then if you want to look at the back, you can see a list of the varieties that we
[18:09.600 --> 18:10.800]  have in the trials.
[18:10.800 --> 18:16.240]  So we've got 13 varieties that are listed as grain or dual purpose.
[18:16.240 --> 18:21.920]  So the ones you see on the signs here, the four fiber entries, which you can see down
[18:21.920 --> 18:22.560]  there.
[18:22.560 --> 18:27.280]  And then there's also some contact information for the seed companies that we got these varieties
[18:27.280 --> 18:27.600]  from.
[18:28.400 --> 18:32.320]  So for future trials, we do hope to get more entries.
[18:32.960 --> 18:38.480]  We want to be able to show for the farmers of New York State, the full spectrum of what's
[18:38.480 --> 18:39.440]  available to them.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.120]  So there's a couple other seed companies in Canada that ran out of seed this year.
[18:45.120 --> 18:48.480]  So we're hoping to get some of their entries from Parkland for next year.
[18:49.280 --> 18:55.280]  And yeah, so next Amelia is going to talk to you a little bit about some of the notes
[18:55.280 --> 18:55.920]  that we've taken.
[18:55.920 --> 18:56.400]  Yeah.
[18:56.480 --> 19:01.760]  First wondering, why didn't you just tissue culture the cannabis that grows organically
[19:01.760 --> 19:08.000]  here in digital city in New York to start a project that already have cold weather and
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  the soil hardiness cannabis?
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.040]  And I don't know.
[19:14.800 --> 19:22.240]  It's that would not be commercially available to farmers right now.
[19:22.560 --> 19:28.320]  The purpose of these trials right now is to see what farmers can purchase and plant in
[19:28.320 --> 19:30.000]  their fields right now.
[19:30.720 --> 19:35.680]  So yeah, I'm trying to talk to you about the variety trials that we have.
[19:35.680 --> 19:38.080]  That's part of a future breeding program.
[19:38.080 --> 19:38.480]  Right.
[19:38.480 --> 19:45.440]  So the whole idea, we would, of course, native hemp varieties are of interest in breeding
[19:45.440 --> 19:51.520]  programs, but for the trials, this is what a farmer can get seed of and plant next spring.
[19:51.520 --> 19:54.320]  So that's what we need to show.
[19:54.880 --> 19:55.280]  Okay.
[19:55.280 --> 19:57.200]  Any other questions before I pass?
[19:57.200 --> 19:57.840]  Yes, sir.
[19:57.840 --> 20:04.080]  The variety there that has three weeks behind, do you expect it to grow to this extent or
[20:04.080 --> 20:04.560]  it will never?
[20:05.520 --> 20:07.840]  I don't think it will ever get quite this tall.
[20:08.960 --> 20:09.520]  They were.
[20:09.520 --> 20:10.160]  I can answer that.
[20:10.720 --> 20:16.480]  Once it starts the photo period change, it stops its growth upward, produces flower or
[20:16.480 --> 20:16.720]  seed.
[20:17.600 --> 20:22.480]  The gentleman who came last week, he is the one who markets Anka.
[20:22.480 --> 20:30.240]  So Rubenstone, he was saying that they have areas where they've planted Anka in the
[20:30.240 --> 20:34.240]  beginning of May and that's like 15 feet tall.
[20:34.880 --> 20:37.520]  So yes.
[20:37.520 --> 20:41.840]  Jamie, are there a few varieties that are photo period insensitive?
[20:42.720 --> 20:44.160]  I thought that one up in Canada.
[20:44.160 --> 20:46.880]  That's what was called Scorza de Nes.
[20:46.880 --> 20:50.080]  It's photo period insensitive.
[20:50.080 --> 20:54.080]  I think that's what Larry actually wants to breed.
[20:54.960 --> 20:58.960]  There's nothing in a stay neutral yet, but that would be one of the first goals of the
[20:58.960 --> 20:59.920]  breeding program here.
[20:59.920 --> 21:01.600]  I thought there was already some detail.
[21:02.160 --> 21:10.160]  Yes.
[21:10.160 --> 21:13.840]  So I'll bring in Amelia and she's going to talk about some of the notes that we've
[21:13.840 --> 21:15.520]  taken on the trials so far.
[21:16.080 --> 21:16.480]  Hi.
[21:16.480 --> 21:22.720]  So I'm the research intern and with the help of some of our student employees, I've
[21:22.720 --> 21:27.040]  been collecting data on our trials on a weekly basis.
[21:27.040 --> 21:31.040]  Most of these data include notes on height, stand, and flowering.
[21:31.760 --> 21:36.400]  As you can see, all of our varieties are in bloom now.
[21:36.400 --> 21:38.880]  I think the fiber may just be beginning.
[21:39.520 --> 21:43.120]  The fiber varieties have been much slower to begin.
[21:44.800 --> 21:49.360]  And something I've noticed is there's vast differences between our monoecious and
[21:49.360 --> 21:50.480]  dioecious varieties.
[21:51.040 --> 21:57.200]  And for those of you who don't know, dioecious varieties are the ones that have male and
[21:57.200 --> 22:03.360]  female plants that are separate and monoecious plants produce male and female parts on the
[22:03.360 --> 22:04.080]  same plant.
[22:05.760 --> 22:14.560]  All of our dioecious varieties began to bloom sooner and they did so much more vigorously
[22:14.560 --> 22:17.680]  at first and then their growth sort of slowed down.
[22:17.680 --> 22:24.720]  Whereas the monoecious varieties have continued to grow a lot more at a much more
[22:24.720 --> 22:25.840]  steady and linear rate.
[22:28.160 --> 22:34.560]  We plan on combining our grain and dual purpose varieties in the fall when about 70%
[22:34.560 --> 22:35.600]  of the seeds are mature.
[22:36.800 --> 22:40.880]  So we're expecting to do that probably September, October.
[22:41.520 --> 22:46.320]  And our fiber trial will be harvested when 20% flowering occurs.
[22:48.320 --> 22:50.560]  So that's all we have for now.
[22:51.680 --> 22:58.320]  There was a note in one of your handouts that the monoecious are only used for breeding.
[22:59.200 --> 23:01.520]  They're not generally put in the field.
[23:02.320 --> 23:03.680]  I was just curious why.
[23:05.760 --> 23:10.720]  Well, there are breeding varieties that are monoecious.
[23:10.720 --> 23:12.160]  I think there's some varieties already.
[23:12.720 --> 23:18.960]  It says just because you said a comment that said monoecious cultivars are generally only
[23:18.960 --> 23:20.320]  grown by plant breeders.
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.000]  Is that that they're just not as advanced or is that they produce less seed or?
[23:28.800 --> 23:34.240]  I'm not sure that that's true because a lot of people prefer monoecious varieties because
[23:34.240 --> 23:38.960]  they won't lose 40% of their crops due to that male plant.
[23:38.960 --> 23:40.880]  Yeah, that's why I was just curious.
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.380]  Yeah.
[23:42.720 --> 23:46.320]  Will you be using the seed from these in future plantings?
[23:46.320 --> 23:49.680]  What about cross pollination between any of them?
[23:49.680 --> 23:50.180]  No.
[23:52.480 --> 23:55.520]  No, we plant we plant certified seed in our trials.
[23:56.400 --> 23:58.480]  And so we won't be saving any seed.
[23:58.480 --> 24:04.960]  Well, we will test the quality of these seeds for different oil production.
[24:04.960 --> 24:09.440]  But when it comes to planting again, we're going back to the certified seed bags.
[24:10.400 --> 24:11.440]  And it's illegal.
[24:11.440 --> 24:15.680]  I mean, just point out that it is in fact illegal to save the seed.
[24:15.680 --> 24:17.840]  Why is that?
[24:17.840 --> 24:19.360]  Chris?
[24:19.360 --> 24:21.200]  So you have to buy it every year.
[24:21.200 --> 24:26.160]  No, it has to do with federal DEA permission.
[24:26.160 --> 24:27.600]  Okay, it's the DEA.
[24:27.600 --> 24:29.280]  It's not an intellectual property.
[24:29.280 --> 24:30.000]  It is.
[24:30.000 --> 24:30.720]  Well, there is.
[24:30.720 --> 24:38.480]  There are some varieties that you will sign an MTA with, but it's also illegal.
[24:39.440 --> 24:42.640]  At least our permit does not allow us to hold these seeds.
[24:44.320 --> 24:45.440]  Can you clone these plants?
[24:45.440 --> 24:46.080]  Right.
[24:46.080 --> 24:46.560]  But there are...
[24:46.560 --> 24:48.960]  They're flowering now, but it's not an infected plant.
[24:48.960 --> 24:49.600]  Is that legal?
[24:50.240 --> 24:50.740]  No.
[24:51.760 --> 24:52.960]  So what are the farms...
[24:52.960 --> 24:56.400]  I mean, if you have a license to do that, then it's illegal.
[24:56.400 --> 24:57.600]  Then it is legal.
[24:57.600 --> 24:58.640]  Okay, but it's illegal.
[24:58.640 --> 24:59.040]  Oh, sorry.
[24:59.040 --> 25:00.960]  The question was, can you clone the plants?
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.160]  Can you put them into tissue culture?
[25:02.160 --> 25:05.120]  And that's absolutely something that we're going to be doing here at Cornell.
[25:05.120 --> 25:07.760]  In fact, the director of our tissue culture facility is here today.
[25:08.880 --> 25:14.800]  But you have to have the appropriate licensing from the company who sold you the seed,
[25:14.800 --> 25:20.080]  and you also have to have the appropriate permits so that Matthew doesn't get thrown in jail.
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.480]  We like him, and we like you, Matthew.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.920]  Will breeding efforts focus on varieties or strategies that won't necessarily incur as
[25:31.920 --> 25:36.320]  many licensing issues or material transfer agreements for farmers?
[25:37.120 --> 25:38.400]  That will not incur?
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.080]  Well, I mean, so eventually, ideally, people will be able to say,
[25:42.080 --> 25:45.840]  you can see from him and won't be breeding from varieties that might
[25:47.360 --> 25:49.920]  previously have such restrictions on them.
[25:51.120 --> 25:52.080]  State by state.
[25:52.080 --> 25:56.160]  If you're in Colorado, you're the only states that have certified seed planters.
[25:56.160 --> 25:56.660]  Yeah.
[25:57.920 --> 26:00.560]  Yeah, I'm not sure how to answer that question.
[26:01.360 --> 26:01.860]  Yeah, I didn't...
[26:02.260 --> 26:03.620]  I didn't quite hear the whole question there.
[26:03.620 --> 26:04.900]  Something about breeding, what?
[26:04.900 --> 26:06.980]  Well, I guess some of these varieties,
[26:08.580 --> 26:11.620]  I have licensing agreements that you can't repeatedly save seed.
[26:11.620 --> 26:12.120]  Right.
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.580]  Is that legally towards the companies that own the variety on top of federal regulation?
[26:16.580 --> 26:17.080]  Oh, yes.
[26:17.780 --> 26:18.820]  So that's absolutely right.
[26:18.820 --> 26:24.420]  That happens with most crop species, even with alfalfa that you see the plots behind you there,
[26:25.060 --> 26:26.660]  that we work with on our project as well.
[26:26.900 --> 26:31.940]  Especially the private companies will go through what's called a plant variety protection.
[26:32.740 --> 26:34.820]  Some will actually patent their varieties.
[26:34.820 --> 26:36.980]  And so that's a legal process.
[26:36.980 --> 26:43.220]  So that makes sure that you or I cannot pirate their seed and call it our own variety.
[26:43.780 --> 26:47.220]  They put all the expense into the research and development of that variety
[26:47.220 --> 26:48.740]  and producing the seed and so forth.
[26:48.740 --> 26:51.300]  They want to protect it so that they can get some payback
[26:51.300 --> 26:53.220]  so that it continue with the future.
[26:53.700 --> 27:00.900]  So that's just part of the legal protection system.
[27:00.900 --> 27:03.460]  It's not part of the drug enforcement agency or anything like that.
[27:04.100 --> 27:09.060]  But it's just part of the system to make sure that companies are protecting their own interest.
[27:10.180 --> 27:11.700]  And I don't say that in a selfish way.
[27:11.700 --> 27:15.300]  That's kind of the way it needs to be in order for companies to have the incentive
[27:15.300 --> 27:19.460]  to put all the funding into research and development of products like this.
[27:19.460 --> 27:20.740]  Does that answer your question?
[27:20.740 --> 27:23.860]  Well, I just want to hear if you then breed off of varieties that
[27:25.220 --> 27:26.100]  have those protections.
[27:26.100 --> 27:28.260]  Do those continue forward?
[27:28.260 --> 27:33.940]  So if we do that, we need to go to that company and ask if they would allow us to do that
[27:33.940 --> 27:35.460]  and sign an agreement.
[27:35.460 --> 27:41.620]  And of course, we'd have to pay them a royalty on any varieties that we develop from their materials.
[27:41.620 --> 27:44.660]  Usually there's a royalty basis per pound of seed.
[27:44.660 --> 27:47.540]  You know, so many cents per pound of seed that we have to pay back to them.
[27:48.900 --> 27:50.580]  There's a couple of patent attorney over here.
[27:50.580 --> 27:51.940]  There's a couple of different issues going on.
[27:51.940 --> 27:54.740]  You may actually be able to patent a gene sequence.
[27:54.740 --> 27:58.020]  You can't patent the whole genome, but you might be able to patent the sequence that
[27:58.020 --> 27:59.940]  gives it a particular characteristic.
[27:59.940 --> 28:05.220]  In that case, any of us wouldn't be able to grow a hemp plant with that particular gene
[28:05.220 --> 28:08.020]  sequence in it because then we would be violating their patent.
[28:08.660 --> 28:13.060]  But if you enter into a license agreement with one of these companies, then there's
[28:13.060 --> 28:17.300]  potentially additional restrictions on top of whether or not you can actually breed with
[28:17.300 --> 28:18.180]  their plant.
[28:18.180 --> 28:23.300]  Technically, by the patent law itself, if you breed with their plant and then produce
[28:23.300 --> 28:27.140]  something without that patented gene sequence, you might technically be okay by the patent
[28:27.140 --> 28:30.580]  laws, but by the license agreement, you might not be okay.
[28:30.580 --> 28:31.220]  Right, right.
[28:32.420 --> 28:34.900]  Any other questions about anything related to that?
[28:34.900 --> 28:35.300]  Yes.
[28:35.300 --> 28:37.940]  Do you have any plans to test auto flower for oil?
[28:38.980 --> 28:39.780]  Auto flower?
[28:39.780 --> 28:40.280]  Yeah.
[28:40.580 --> 28:41.620]  We haven't thought about that.
[28:41.620 --> 28:44.100]  At least I haven't, but that might be an interesting thing to do.
[28:44.100 --> 28:46.340]  We have a short growth cycle.
[28:46.340 --> 28:46.980]  Good point.
[28:47.220 --> 28:48.260]  What's the seed cost?
[28:48.980 --> 28:50.500]  How much does seed cost?
[28:50.500 --> 28:52.180]  Jamie, what do we have to pay for that?
[28:53.380 --> 28:53.880]  This.
[28:54.500 --> 28:55.380]  I'm going to give you the mic.
[28:57.220 --> 29:04.180]  So for the seed cost, it's probably $2.50 to $3 a pound for the seed.
[29:04.180 --> 29:09.780]  And then you pay for all of the testing that they have to do through APHIS to get it imported
[29:09.780 --> 29:10.900]  to the United States.
[29:10.900 --> 29:15.380]  And then the shipping is expensive on top of that as well.
[29:16.260 --> 29:19.380]  And then, I don't know, what did we work it out to, Chris?
[29:19.380 --> 29:19.940]  Do you remember?
[29:21.940 --> 29:23.540]  Roughly $50 an acre.
[29:23.540 --> 29:26.260]  Yeah, roughly $50 an acre for the seed cost.
[29:27.140 --> 29:28.820]  That was for ANCA?
[29:29.860 --> 29:31.940]  Yeah, that was also when we bought it in bulk.
[29:31.940 --> 29:39.860]  So we bought 51,000 pounds of it and got it at about $50 per acre.
[29:40.820 --> 29:42.020]  How many pounds per acre?
[29:42.900 --> 29:43.400]  30.
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.120]  Yeah, so the question was how many pounds per acre, and we were planning at 30 pounds
[29:48.120 --> 29:50.760]  per acre, which was about the $50 range.
[29:52.680 --> 29:53.180]  Yes?
[29:53.240 --> 29:57.560]  In addition to testing for the oil quality and the fiber content, will you take a look
[29:57.560 --> 30:01.240]  at the pharmaceutical value of this crop, even though I know it's not intended for that
[30:01.240 --> 30:01.720]  purpose?
[30:01.720 --> 30:03.560]  Yes, we're very interested in doing that.
[30:03.560 --> 30:09.480]  So what we would like to do is that, I mean, SUNY Binghamton has a pharmaceutical school
[30:09.480 --> 30:12.680]  now, and we talked to them about a year ago about interest.
[30:12.680 --> 30:16.440]  I know they're working with some other people now, too, but we would like to get some people
[30:16.440 --> 30:17.880]  interested in looking at that.
[30:17.880 --> 30:21.800]  Right, so the question was, I think, if I heard it right, I think the question was,
[30:21.800 --> 30:26.040]  are we going to be looking at other non-THC medicinal compounds?
[30:26.040 --> 30:27.000]  Yeah, basically.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.800]  Yeah, so this year, again, we're getting that up and running, so we'll just do it
[30:31.800 --> 30:33.160]  as a one-shot deal.
[30:33.160 --> 30:38.520]  We have at Cornell our BRC BioResource Center.
[30:39.800 --> 30:41.640]  We'll be gearing up for that.
[30:41.640 --> 30:50.600]  So we'll test for THC and then for the cannabinoids panel, and then next year, the idea is that
[30:51.480 --> 30:59.640]  we'd have more time to plan a more rigorous scientific study, and we would probably do
[31:00.520 --> 31:01.640]  different timings.
[31:01.640 --> 31:08.120]  But at least for this year, we'll get information from the 17 varieties, at least a snapshot,
[31:08.920 --> 31:12.360]  and we'll do that for each of our six locations that has the varieties.
[31:12.360 --> 31:13.400]  Yeah, I'm glad.
[31:13.960 --> 31:17.160]  Thanks for clarifying that, Chris, because yeah, we're not doing everything this year.
[31:17.160 --> 31:20.200]  This is our initial year, but in the future, we would like to do that.
[31:20.200 --> 31:21.160]  So, yes?
[31:21.160 --> 31:24.440]  Don, same question I asked you before about harvesting equipment, just wanted to sort
[31:24.440 --> 31:25.000]  of throw it out.
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.800]  If you guys have, what are you guys doing for combines or making adjustments to your
[31:29.800 --> 31:33.960]  combines, or if there's any specialty equipment you guys are looking into, or if anyone has
[31:33.960 --> 31:35.240]  any specialty equipment?
[31:35.240 --> 31:37.400]  So I think that's a general question for everybody.
[31:37.400 --> 31:41.400]  Ed and I were talking about that before we started here, about harvest equipment that
[31:41.400 --> 31:45.880]  you use, and it would probably be different for the fiber varieties versus the grain and
[31:45.880 --> 31:46.920]  dual-purpose varieties.
[31:47.480 --> 31:52.360]  I mean, I've heard, I've read that people have used the combine for the grain and dual-purpose
[31:52.360 --> 31:56.600]  types, but sometimes there can be some problems with all the stalk material wrapping around
[31:56.600 --> 31:58.360]  the components of the combine.
[31:59.480 --> 32:00.360]  So that is an issue.
[32:00.360 --> 32:02.440]  Anybody have any experience with that or thoughts on that?
[32:02.520 --> 32:05.560]  I have clients in North Carolina using hand accordicators.
[32:05.560 --> 32:06.680]  Using what?
[32:06.680 --> 32:07.000]  A hand what?
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.120]  Hand accordicators.
[32:08.120 --> 32:08.680]  Oh, okay.
[32:08.680 --> 32:09.180]  Yeah.
[32:11.000 --> 32:17.160]  I know a farmer in Vermont that actually left a remainder of the hemp field because it took
[32:17.160 --> 32:19.880]  about two or three days just to combine four acres.
[32:19.880 --> 32:20.360]  Oh, really?
[32:20.920 --> 32:28.360]  And they had to repeatedly stop and unwind the combine and resharpen the blades and whatnot
[32:28.360 --> 32:32.120]  because the fiber was just too much for their John Deere combine.
[32:32.520 --> 32:34.520]  So that could be an issue.
[32:34.520 --> 32:39.400]  And I know that's a common issue throughout the hemp industry right now, is the harvesting
[32:39.400 --> 32:39.960]  of it.
[32:39.960 --> 32:46.360]  Yeah, so that's something where some agricultural engineers could come in handy to work out
[32:46.360 --> 32:47.320]  that system.
[32:47.320 --> 32:49.560]  But there is, I mean, obviously there's a lot of fiber in there.
[32:49.560 --> 32:51.640]  Even in the grain types, there's a lot of fiber.
[32:51.640 --> 32:54.680]  I mean, otherwise, this tall material wouldn't stand up like it would.
[32:54.680 --> 32:57.080]  I mean, we're just catching up with the rest of the world here.
[32:57.080 --> 32:59.480]  Are there machines in other countries?
[32:59.480 --> 33:00.040]  Australia.
[33:00.040 --> 33:00.540]  Australia.
[33:00.700 --> 33:02.700]  I know that they have one that does it all the time.
[33:02.700 --> 33:04.700]  They have a plant that does it all the time.
[33:04.700 --> 33:06.380]  It's a historic challenge, though.
[33:06.380 --> 33:07.500]  It's always been a challenge.
[33:07.500 --> 33:08.860]  The hemp industry has always...
[33:08.860 --> 33:13.820]  My company is associated with some partners from the University of Taiwan.
[33:13.820 --> 33:15.900]  And we've been doing this in China for...
[33:15.900 --> 33:18.860]  They've been doing this in China for many, many years.
[33:18.860 --> 33:23.340]  Essentially, you could buy a piece of machinery that actually separates all of it.
[33:23.900 --> 33:28.460]  Seeds, oil, any part of this pack.
[33:29.420 --> 33:30.780]  So what is your company again?
[33:30.780 --> 33:32.700]  The Industries.
[33:32.700 --> 33:34.300]  What was that?
[33:34.300 --> 33:35.500]  The Industries.
[33:35.500 --> 33:37.740]  I believe it might be Cisco.
[33:40.700 --> 33:41.020]  Thank you.
[33:41.740 --> 33:43.820]  Other questions before we go on to the next speaker?
[33:46.780 --> 33:47.020]  Okay.
[33:48.380 --> 33:54.460]  I'm curious what you'll be doing next year or any research on, like, the systems work.
[33:55.020 --> 33:56.220]  Follows hemp well.
[33:56.220 --> 33:59.340]  How to deal with all the fiber in the field for next year.
[34:00.140 --> 34:00.620]  Yeah.
[34:00.620 --> 34:05.420]  Chris can help me answer that because she and Larry Smart have been thinking about this.
[34:06.060 --> 34:08.380]  One of the things that we want to do, too...
[34:08.380 --> 34:14.060]  Right now, we just have these variety trials just on Cornell land.
[34:14.060 --> 34:16.380]  We would like to spread that out some throughout the state.
[34:17.020 --> 34:21.260]  Right now, several producers are just growing Anka.
[34:21.820 --> 34:24.220]  But we would like to get some variety trials more widespread.
[34:24.540 --> 34:28.220]  Get a better idea of the best varieties for New York state conditions,
[34:28.220 --> 34:30.060]  not just on our experimental farmland.
[34:30.780 --> 34:31.420]  So that's one.
[34:31.420 --> 34:33.740]  But Chris, I don't know if you want to contribute more to that.
[34:33.740 --> 34:34.620]  Can you guys all hear me?
[34:35.180 --> 34:40.300]  So, yeah, in terms of on-farm or rotational strategies,
[34:40.860 --> 34:45.900]  there's a scientist, Matt Ryan, who's in the soil and crop science section of SIPS.
[34:45.900 --> 34:50.780]  And he's going to be looking at integrating hemp into his system study.
[34:50.780 --> 34:57.660]  And then in addition to that, I think one of the things that we can do fairly easily
[34:57.660 --> 35:02.140]  is right now we're looking at what is hemp following at the 29 farms.
[35:02.140 --> 35:06.140]  And there are some interesting things because there were some growers that sprayed
[35:06.140 --> 35:08.780]  and were ready to prep for soybean,
[35:08.780 --> 35:11.020]  but they couldn't get their soybean in because of the rain.
[35:11.020 --> 35:12.060]  And now they're putting hemp in.
[35:12.060 --> 35:16.060]  So we'll be able to tell, do the herbicides that were put on to prep for soybean,
[35:16.060 --> 35:17.900]  are they an issue for hemp?
[35:17.900 --> 35:21.580]  So in some ways, the 29 farms are helping us with that.
[35:21.580 --> 35:25.260]  The other thing that will be helped with is that we can go back to them next year
[35:25.260 --> 35:27.180]  and see if they're having issues.
[35:27.180 --> 35:29.500]  You know, what are they following and are they having issues?
[35:29.500 --> 35:31.820]  So we can follow that for a while.
[35:31.820 --> 35:37.020]  So right now, we are developing our systems approach,
[35:37.020 --> 35:42.460]  but we can use the 29 farms sort of as a real life, you know,
[35:42.460 --> 35:44.220]  scientific study to see what happens.
[35:45.180 --> 35:49.260]  And any of you, you know, once you guys start growing hemp
[35:49.260 --> 35:52.780]  and anything that you found has affected the hemp,
[35:52.780 --> 35:55.260]  either that you did before the hemp goes in the ground
[35:55.260 --> 35:58.140]  or after it's coming off going in the next year,
[35:58.140 --> 36:02.300]  I mean, that's all really valuable information that we hope to learn from you guys.
[36:02.300 --> 36:06.540]  Any other questions before we move on?
[36:06.540 --> 36:07.020]  Yes.
[36:07.020 --> 36:11.260]  I was curious to know if you watered this or if you just relied on rain?
[36:11.260 --> 36:11.740]  Not this year.
[36:12.540 --> 36:13.900]  Yeah, we've had plenty of rain.
[36:14.140 --> 36:16.780]  You did irrigate it once to start with, didn't you, Amy?
[36:18.220 --> 36:21.020]  We had one dry spell in June,
[36:21.660 --> 36:27.900]  and at that time, we weren't sure the DEA was going to allow us to plant in all of our locations.
[36:27.900 --> 36:30.140]  They were like, we need this to survive.
[36:30.700 --> 36:35.980]  So we did irrigate it for, I don't know, just a couple hours,
[36:35.980 --> 36:39.340]  one morning at the very early seedling stage,
[36:39.340 --> 36:42.460]  but none of the other trials were irrigated.
[36:42.460 --> 36:44.780]  We just were just like, we need this to survive.
[36:44.780 --> 36:46.300]  What happens if it cooks?
[36:46.300 --> 36:49.900]  And so there was an act of desperation here just to make sure.
[36:51.180 --> 36:52.780]  And it turns out it probably would have been fine,
[36:54.700 --> 36:56.780]  but none of the other trials have been irrigated.
[36:58.140 --> 36:59.740]  Obviously, it's been an unusual year.
[37:00.300 --> 37:02.620]  Last year was so dry and this year is so wet,
[37:02.620 --> 37:04.780]  and if you put the two years together, it averages out,
[37:04.780 --> 37:06.780]  but that's not the way the plants act.
[37:06.780 --> 37:08.860]  They don't work on averages.
[37:09.820 --> 37:12.140]  So with all the rain that we've had this season,
[37:13.180 --> 37:15.580]  each week we wonder, well, is the faucet going to turn off
[37:15.580 --> 37:18.060]  and then it's going to turn dry the rest of the summer?
[37:18.060 --> 37:21.260]  And you just never know, but it just keeps on going.
[37:23.260 --> 37:26.540]  I mean, we got this planted late, later, maybe several weeks,
[37:26.540 --> 37:29.180]  maybe a month later than what we really wanted to plant it,
[37:29.180 --> 37:31.020]  but yet it's growing very tall,
[37:31.020 --> 37:34.460]  and so we've had plenty of moisture to keep it going this season.
[37:35.740 --> 37:36.380]  Other questions?
[37:37.180 --> 37:37.740]  Yes.
[37:37.740 --> 37:40.700]  Do you have any faculty positions opening up at Cornell or anyone know
[37:41.180 --> 37:43.020]  for cannabis genetics?
[37:43.020 --> 37:47.260]  I know a lot of people are kind of taking on this as a new plant,
[37:47.260 --> 37:50.140]  but what about people who specialize in hemp and cannabis?
[37:50.140 --> 37:51.660]  Yeah, I'm going to turn that over to Chris,
[37:51.660 --> 37:53.820]  but I'm not aware of any new faculty positions right now.
[37:55.340 --> 37:57.340]  All right, we do have new faculty positions,
[37:57.340 --> 38:00.220]  but the ones that we have right now are not,
[38:01.260 --> 38:02.380]  they're not hemp related.
[38:03.580 --> 38:04.140]  Shouldn't they be?
[38:05.900 --> 38:10.060]  Well, so I think actually to answer that question quite seriously,
[38:10.140 --> 38:16.860]  I think that hiring a faculty member for a 40, 30 or 40 year stint
[38:16.860 --> 38:22.940]  or a 20, 30 year stint is a serious endeavor,
[38:22.940 --> 38:27.500]  and I think that we don't know yet how well hemp is going to do in New York.
[38:27.500 --> 38:30.220]  I mean, this is really the first time that it's been out,
[38:30.220 --> 38:33.820]  and so I think we need to give it a season or two
[38:33.820 --> 38:38.300]  to figure out how we plug that in to our research portfolio
[38:39.260 --> 38:44.140]  and footprint across the state to make sure that we still have folks
[38:44.140 --> 38:47.340]  that are working with our vegetable growers and our field crops growers
[38:48.220 --> 38:49.820]  just to make sure we're very well-rounded.
[38:49.820 --> 38:53.900]  And so I think the people that are on hemp, we're all in,
[38:53.900 --> 38:57.100]  and I feel like we're covering it quite well,
[38:57.100 --> 38:59.740]  and in the future, if it continues to expand,
[38:59.740 --> 39:01.420]  then we would certainly look into that area.
[39:02.460 --> 39:04.300]  I mean, we have the advantage, Chris mentioned earlier,
[39:04.300 --> 39:07.020]  that there are 11 of us on the faculty working on this,
[39:07.020 --> 39:11.180]  and we're all coming from our different areas of specializations
[39:11.180 --> 39:13.660]  put together as a package where we're cooperating together
[39:13.660 --> 39:16.780]  to look at the complete package.
[39:16.780 --> 39:18.380]  So it's not just breeding or genetics,
[39:18.380 --> 39:22.460]  but it's all different areas of research that we're working on here,
[39:23.100 --> 39:24.860]  and that's really what it's going to take.
[39:24.860 --> 39:26.060]  That's what's going to take the work,
[39:26.060 --> 39:28.780]  because it's not just one area of specialization
[39:28.780 --> 39:30.380]  that we need to be focusing on,
[39:30.380 --> 39:33.820]  but we need to look at all aspects of production and so forth.
[39:35.260 --> 39:36.540]  Okay, yes?
[39:36.540 --> 39:40.220]  Hi, I'm curious, is there thought about building communities
[39:40.220 --> 39:43.180]  in terms of worker cooperatives and such
[39:43.180 --> 39:46.300]  so that the extraction devices and the processing devices
[39:46.300 --> 39:48.540]  can be brought back to the farm, farming communities?
[39:49.340 --> 39:50.780]  That's where all the money is.
[39:50.780 --> 39:53.340]  It's one thing to grow the plant, but to manufacture and farm
[39:53.340 --> 39:57.580]  and to process into the 500 different uses,
[39:57.580 --> 39:59.020]  that's where really the money is.
[39:59.020 --> 40:01.020]  So I'm wondering if there's thought about that.
[40:01.020 --> 40:03.580]  Yeah, so I'm not totally sure what your question is
[40:03.580 --> 40:05.020]  about those various uses.
[40:05.020 --> 40:06.460]  Bringing the equipment back to the farm.
[40:06.460 --> 40:08.060]  So for instance, in North Carolina,
[40:08.060 --> 40:11.100]  there's a big movement about building worker cooperatives
[40:11.100 --> 40:12.860]  where they will buy the extraction equipment
[40:12.860 --> 40:14.940]  so that that money stays on the farm.
[40:16.060 --> 40:18.060]  We're seeing this in marijuana on the West Coast.
[40:18.060 --> 40:19.420]  Farmers don't make any money.
[40:19.420 --> 40:21.980]  It's all in the processing and building the markets.
[40:21.980 --> 40:24.940]  So I'm curious as to whether Cornell or New York State
[40:24.940 --> 40:28.220]  is thoughtful in thinking about building those sort of marketability.
[40:29.180 --> 40:31.180]  Cheryl from Harvest New York, I think is here.
[40:32.060 --> 40:33.260]  Cheryl, are you here?
[40:33.260 --> 40:33.820]  There you are.
[40:34.540 --> 40:37.580]  Yes, so we have Cheryl from Harvest New York,
[40:37.580 --> 40:39.020]  Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[40:39.020 --> 40:39.740]  Do you need the mic?
[40:40.300 --> 40:42.140]  No, and I don't have an answer to that right now.
[40:42.140 --> 40:44.140]  I am familiar with what's going on in North Carolina.
[40:44.140 --> 40:45.980]  I don't know that any thought's been given to that yet.
[40:45.980 --> 40:48.460]  I would say too, it's just too new yet so far.
[40:49.500 --> 40:51.260]  So I know Chris is...
[40:51.260 --> 40:51.740]  Where's Chris?
[40:52.300 --> 40:54.940]  He's going to be talking about processors towards the end of it.
[40:55.900 --> 40:57.340]  But I don't have an answer right now to that.
[40:57.340 --> 40:58.220]  It's a great question though.
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.280]  Okay.
[41:01.980 --> 41:02.700]  Let me move on.
[41:02.780 --> 41:04.300]  We'll have more opportunities for questions.
[41:04.300 --> 41:06.060]  We're not done yet this morning.
[41:06.060 --> 41:06.940]  But let me move on.
[41:06.940 --> 41:10.380]  Before I introduce the next speaker though, I might mention,
[41:10.380 --> 41:12.300]  some of you may have noticed or maybe you didn't notice
[41:12.300 --> 41:14.780]  the tall fence that's around our experimental farm here.
[41:15.900 --> 41:20.860]  So that fence is there because we have a lot of deer problems around here.
[41:21.500 --> 41:25.020]  And you see some forage species behind you, alfalfa and so forth.
[41:25.020 --> 41:26.940]  If we didn't have some way to control the deer,
[41:27.900 --> 41:30.700]  we wouldn't be able to collect the data for our research purposes
[41:30.700 --> 41:32.060]  that we need to collect.
[41:32.060 --> 41:35.740]  So I don't know, I mean, people have asked me if deer are a problem on hemp.
[41:35.740 --> 41:37.420]  And I don't really don't know the answer to that.
[41:37.420 --> 41:39.100]  We haven't had experience with it yet.
[41:39.100 --> 41:43.500]  Have any of you heard anything about whether deer will bother hemp at all?
[41:43.500 --> 41:44.140]  Yes.
[41:44.140 --> 41:49.260]  In Vermont, I was told that the seedlings, the deer really liked.
[41:49.260 --> 41:53.500]  But as the hemp grew tall and more fibrous, the deer just left it alone.
[41:53.500 --> 41:54.860]  Oh, okay. Too much fiber in there.
[41:55.580 --> 41:58.620]  So it might depend on the cultivar, really.
[41:59.260 --> 42:01.420]  So if we didn't have this fence here,
[42:01.420 --> 42:03.820]  they would be eating our alfalfa, but leaving the hemp alone.
[42:04.700 --> 42:04.940]  Okay.
[42:04.940 --> 42:08.780]  Well, I talked to someone in Colorado who said he wished he had fences up.
[42:08.780 --> 42:09.660]  Oh, okay.
[42:12.220 --> 42:14.860]  Do you know if it's mainly on young growth?
[42:14.860 --> 42:18.620]  Yeah, he was growing for CBD, but he didn't say at what point they were using it.
[42:18.620 --> 42:18.860]  Okay.
[42:20.060 --> 42:23.340]  Yeah, I'm growing for CBD in Oregon, and we've had no problem with deer at all.
[42:23.340 --> 42:26.300]  We have multiple, like four different farms going right now,
[42:26.300 --> 42:28.060]  different areas, so we've been very fortunate.
[42:28.060 --> 42:29.340]  None of them have been fenced down.
[42:29.340 --> 42:30.060]  Okay.
[42:30.060 --> 42:30.780]  Did everybody hear that?
[42:30.780 --> 42:33.660]  So he said in Oregon, they haven't had any problems at all with deer.
[42:34.860 --> 42:35.340]  Okay.
[42:35.340 --> 42:37.100]  Let me introduce the next speaker.
[42:37.100 --> 42:41.660]  You know, anytime you have more and more acreage of any kind of a crop species,
[42:41.660 --> 42:45.260]  and right now we don't have that, a lot of acreage, but it's growing.
[42:46.300 --> 42:49.180]  But whenever you have that, it's going to be
[42:49.180 --> 42:51.580]  susceptible to various disease and insect problems.
[42:52.380 --> 42:56.220]  So Dr. Gary Burstrom, he's the chair of the department,
[42:56.700 --> 43:00.780]  of the section of plant pathology and plant microbiology within the School of Integrative
[43:00.780 --> 43:06.860]  Plant Science, and he does a lot of research and extension activities on diseases of field crops.
[43:06.860 --> 43:09.980]  And Elson Shields, our entomologist, was going to be here,
[43:10.700 --> 43:14.940]  but some things came up and he's not able to be here today, but he did tell me
[43:15.580 --> 43:19.420]  about a few insect problems, but Gary, if you've seen any insects in your...
[43:19.420 --> 43:20.140]  Okay.
[43:20.140 --> 43:22.060]  I'll let you talk about diseases first.
[43:22.060 --> 43:22.540]  Thanks, Don.
[43:23.340 --> 43:30.860]  So I will confess that I'm a student of hemp diseases at this point,
[43:30.860 --> 43:34.620]  and trying to learn everything I can, along, I suspect, with a lot of you here.
[43:35.180 --> 43:39.980]  So as Don said, I've worked in field crops for a number of years,
[43:40.540 --> 43:47.580]  and we are looking forward to getting a better handle and inventory on what some of the pest
[43:47.580 --> 43:50.300]  problems are on industrial hemp.
[43:50.940 --> 43:56.300]  And I've also spent some time talking to some colleagues in some other parts of the country,
[43:56.300 --> 44:00.540]  and some of these recent visitors from Canada about some of the things they've encountered.
[44:01.100 --> 44:07.260]  But by and large, we're going to use these variety plots in Ithaca, Geneva, and other places,
[44:07.260 --> 44:14.300]  and these distributed farms across New York State to try to inventory all of the pest issues that
[44:15.100 --> 44:15.740]  we find.
[44:16.300 --> 44:22.220]  And typical for a new crop like this, a lot of these pathogens tend to be rather specific
[44:22.220 --> 44:25.180]  in the crop species that they attack.
[44:25.740 --> 44:30.940]  So we could reasonably expect, as we expand the acreage and intensity of the crop,
[44:31.500 --> 44:37.660]  we may not see a lot of these pest problems now, but we can anticipate that they would increase
[44:37.660 --> 44:43.580]  the more that we grow the crop intensively on a particular farm, or more extensively.
[44:45.180 --> 44:48.780]  So I think most of you are aware there are no pesticides of any class
[44:49.660 --> 44:54.860]  used on the crop at this point, and that includes fungicides, and that also includes
[44:54.860 --> 44:57.260]  seed treatment fungicides.
[44:57.260 --> 45:02.940]  Dr. Alan Taylor is going to talk a little bit later on the program about some seed treatment
[45:02.940 --> 45:03.740]  technology.
[45:04.700 --> 45:12.060]  One of the things we would be concerned about is what protection we need to get these seedlings
[45:12.060 --> 45:12.780]  out of the ground.
[45:13.420 --> 45:19.580]  And one thing we have noticed in a number of the locations, at fairly low incidence,
[45:19.580 --> 45:24.700]  not really causing an economic problem, but we could see even in this fairly dry season,
[45:25.500 --> 45:32.060]  we have seen a number of the water mold pathogens attacking the seed and seedlings,
[45:32.860 --> 45:38.300]  that under less favorable conditions for sowing the crop, we could anticipate more problem.
[45:39.100 --> 45:45.100]  And in the vast majority of field crops and vegetables, we, except for strictly organic
[45:45.100 --> 45:53.100]  production, there is often a seed applied fungicide or water mold active material.
[45:53.100 --> 46:00.860]  So that is something that we would be looking at in the future as a possible means of controlling
[46:00.860 --> 46:01.980]  some of these problems.
[46:02.300 --> 46:10.140]  We have also seen a fairly small incidence of some wilting and crown and root symptoms
[46:10.140 --> 46:11.340]  at low incidence.
[46:12.140 --> 46:17.500]  And I could share a whole long list of Latin names with you of the kind of organisms that
[46:17.500 --> 46:20.940]  we are finding there, but at this point we are just taking an inventory.
[46:21.500 --> 46:25.340]  And some of this goes back to what Chris was talking about, the microbiome.
[46:25.340 --> 46:29.660]  There are a lot of fungi and bacteria and other things that are just normally present.
[46:29.820 --> 46:34.620]  And just to find some of these things does not necessarily mean that they are causing
[46:34.620 --> 46:37.180]  some kind of a plague on industrial hemp.
[46:37.180 --> 46:42.380]  So part of the research going forward will be taking some of these organisms, trying
[46:42.380 --> 46:47.180]  to inoculate them onto healthy plants and seeing if they do cause disease.
[46:47.900 --> 46:53.500]  And down the road, I am very excited about this breeding program that will be going on.
[46:53.500 --> 46:59.100]  We will look at some of the principal plant pathogens that we find associated with them.
[47:00.380 --> 47:05.660]  And maybe doing, or someone in the future will be doing some purposeful screening of
[47:05.660 --> 47:09.980]  some of these varieties with some of these potential pathogen problems.
[47:11.500 --> 47:14.940]  It has been mentioned a couple of times about cropping rotations.
[47:15.500 --> 47:19.660]  And as a plant pathologist, that is a center focus for me.
[47:20.540 --> 47:27.580]  Not only can the organism survive in the soil or potentially come in with the seed, but
[47:27.580 --> 47:34.380]  in many cases, some of these organisms will survive on the debris that is left behind
[47:34.380 --> 47:37.580]  in the field and that be the bridge from one growing season to another.
[47:38.300 --> 47:42.700]  And coming back to what I said about the specificity of many of these crop diseases.
[47:43.580 --> 47:49.340]  So for instance, if we were planting this crop after a grain crop like corn or something
[47:49.340 --> 47:54.540]  like that, or a small grain, there would be very, very few organisms that would interact
[47:54.540 --> 47:56.380]  and cause problems on those two crops.
[47:57.100 --> 48:02.620]  The closer they are related, so we could expect some dicot plants to be a little more closely
[48:02.620 --> 48:06.540]  related to the hemp than some of our monocots.
[48:06.540 --> 48:10.940]  So we're going to be looking over time to see if there's any carryover of some of these pests.
[48:11.580 --> 48:16.460]  One that does concern me long term and has been a problem in Canada and some other places
[48:16.460 --> 48:17.340]  is white mold.
[48:17.980 --> 48:24.540]  It's a fungal problem that is already quite rampant in our legume crops and some of our
[48:24.540 --> 48:26.140]  other broadleaf vegetable crops.
[48:26.860 --> 48:33.580]  In soybean production, probably our biggest disease problem right now is Sclerotinia white
[48:33.580 --> 48:33.900]  mold.
[48:34.460 --> 48:41.020]  And that's a very broad host range fungus and it survives the survival structures of
[48:41.020 --> 48:43.100]  the fungus called Sclerotia.
[48:43.100 --> 48:47.180]  They will survive in the soil for a number of years.
[48:47.900 --> 48:53.820]  And so certainly white mold is something we'll be looking at in the hemp, particularly in
[48:53.820 --> 49:00.860]  rotations that would include vegetable beans, dry beans, soybean, highly susceptible crops
[49:00.860 --> 49:01.660]  to white mold.
[49:01.660 --> 49:04.860]  So rotations are very important in this sense as well.
[49:06.780 --> 49:08.700]  So I don't want to talk at you a lot here.
[49:08.700 --> 49:15.820]  I wanted to make you aware that we're very interested in learning more, first about what
[49:15.820 --> 49:18.940]  the diseases and potential disease problems might be.
[49:18.940 --> 49:22.140]  And obviously a long term interest is how to manage those.
[49:22.940 --> 49:29.100]  I will mention two people from my program, Kevin Myers in the back here and Jamie Cummings
[49:29.100 --> 49:36.620]  will be working in our lab to do a lot of the diagnosis and of potential disease problems
[49:36.620 --> 49:39.340]  and work with this new crop.
[49:39.340 --> 49:48.060]  So we would be appreciative of anybody seeing anything in their fields and letting us know.
[49:48.060 --> 49:50.860]  We'd be glad to diagnose problems in our laboratory.
[49:50.860 --> 49:52.620]  Get out in your fields and look.
[49:52.620 --> 49:57.340]  So please, please keep us informed and let us know how we can be of help to you.
[49:58.140 --> 50:04.700]  So another thing just to quickly say that one of the main advantages against diseases
[50:04.700 --> 50:08.460]  is just the vigorous rapid growth of this crop.
[50:08.460 --> 50:12.380]  And that's one of the things I've learned from talking to colleagues in other places.
[50:12.380 --> 50:13.820]  Yeah, we see some leaf spots.
[50:13.820 --> 50:15.740]  Yeah, we see some of this and that.
[50:15.740 --> 50:18.220]  But the crop basically outgrows them.
[50:18.860 --> 50:25.180]  And that is an advantage with this crop that it's timely planted in appropriate soils.
[50:26.300 --> 50:32.860]  Another thing, we're not weed scientists in our program, but Kevin has been taking some
[50:32.860 --> 50:35.660]  notes in the various plots about weed density.
[50:35.660 --> 50:44.460]  And a great take home message here is a tremendous correlation between the weed density in these
[50:44.460 --> 50:50.380]  plots and what the original stand was from the emergence, success and emergence of those
[50:50.380 --> 50:50.780]  plots.
[50:50.780 --> 50:56.380]  So the best defense against weeds, especially in the absence of any herbicides to use, is
[50:56.380 --> 50:59.900]  just to have a good crop establishment, have a good initial stand.
[51:00.460 --> 51:05.100]  And very often that this will be sufficient to outcompete the weeds.
[51:05.100 --> 51:07.660]  So a pretty good strategy if you can do that.
[51:08.700 --> 51:11.660]  Any questions or comments, some observations others have made?
[51:11.660 --> 51:12.460]  Yeah, please.
[51:12.460 --> 51:18.700]  What is the closest normal plant in New York, that family relationship to hemp?
[51:18.700 --> 51:19.900]  And if you...
[51:19.900 --> 51:21.260]  I would say hops.
[51:21.260 --> 51:22.380]  Okay, hops would be the closest.
[51:22.380 --> 51:28.460]  Can you then say that whatever attacks hops, diseases or pests, is similarly probably going
[51:28.460 --> 51:29.740]  to attack these?
[51:29.740 --> 51:33.740]  Only as a very general statement.
[51:34.700 --> 51:40.860]  Even within a plant family, there's tremendous specificity in these pathogens.
[51:40.860 --> 51:43.100]  There are some things that would be candidates that way.
[51:43.660 --> 51:49.420]  A lot of the things that attack through the soil, the water molds, the fusaria, rhizoctonia,
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.180]  some of these things tend to have a fairly wide host range.
[51:53.820 --> 51:57.820]  A lot of the leaf spotting type organisms are really rather specific.
[51:58.860 --> 52:02.780]  And I think things like the downy mildews, Chris, would be pretty separate from the hops
[52:02.780 --> 52:05.260]  and the hemp in this case.
[52:06.220 --> 52:14.620]  The more a pathogen is specialized, the less we worry about that for related crops.
[52:14.620 --> 52:16.460]  But definitely, that's something we'd be looking at.
[52:16.460 --> 52:19.100]  And there are some candidate things we'd be looking at.
[52:20.300 --> 52:25.660]  But I still come back to white mold being the biggest concern that way, because it's
[52:26.300 --> 52:30.060]  very broad host range to weeds as well as cultivated crops.
[52:30.460 --> 52:34.220]  Anybody observe anything on your farms at this point?
[52:36.220 --> 52:37.740]  Okay, well keep us in mind if we can help.
[52:37.740 --> 52:38.540]  Yeah, David?
[52:38.540 --> 52:45.100]  In regard to some of the pests, Farm Viability is funding Jen Gilbert Jenkins at Morrisville
[52:45.100 --> 52:49.340]  with some plots this summer specifically to look at insect pests.
[52:49.340 --> 52:52.460]  I don't know that she's doing much with diseases, but certainly with insects.
[52:52.460 --> 52:55.820]  So she might have some good information to share as well.
[52:56.060 --> 52:58.140]  So she might have some good information to share as well.
[52:58.140 --> 53:03.180]  Chris Becker has been interacting with her, and we have had a few things arrive at either
[53:03.180 --> 53:05.660]  Chris's lab or mine in connection with that.
[53:05.660 --> 53:11.020]  But yeah, we would absolutely love to plug in with that and get all the learning we can
[53:11.020 --> 53:13.340]  out of these plots that are established.
[53:14.380 --> 53:16.380]  And we've also provided funding for her.
[53:16.380 --> 53:23.420]  She's planning to do a statewide trial next summer on fertilization in hemp and 10 different
[53:23.420 --> 53:24.540]  farms around the state.
[53:24.540 --> 53:25.260]  Very interesting.
[53:25.260 --> 53:28.940]  We've provided some funding for her to buy the seed already for that.
[53:28.940 --> 53:29.740]  That's good to know.
[53:29.740 --> 53:30.300]  Thank you.
[53:30.300 --> 53:30.620]  Thank you.
[53:32.140 --> 53:36.380]  Don, would you like to say a few things about insects?
[53:38.380 --> 53:40.540]  So again, Elson Shields has been working on this.
[53:40.540 --> 53:45.020]  He's in our entomology department, but unfortunately he was not able to make it here after all.
[53:45.660 --> 53:51.580]  But he did send me a list of a few insects that he's observed in the hemp around the
[53:51.580 --> 53:52.300]  state so far.
[53:52.940 --> 54:00.380]  One of them is a lichens bug, maybe a quarter inch big bug there that eats the growing tips
[54:00.380 --> 54:06.460]  of the plant, but also the reproductive parts, the floral parts of the plant, which obviously
[54:06.460 --> 54:10.060]  could be very critical on the grain types or the dual purpose types there.
[54:10.060 --> 54:12.620]  So that's one of the things that he's keeping a watch on.
[54:12.620 --> 54:18.060]  Another insect which is actually prevalent on a lot of species is potato leafhopper.
[54:18.060 --> 54:19.980]  And we have problems with that on our alfalfa.
[54:20.620 --> 54:23.580]  If we don't spray an insecticide or use a resistant variety.
[54:24.140 --> 54:27.580]  But apparently he's been seeing it on industrial hemp as well.
[54:28.140 --> 54:29.900]  A third one that he mentioned is thrips.
[54:29.900 --> 54:34.620]  That's a very, very small insect, but that could get into the floral parts.
[54:35.260 --> 54:37.020]  They eat pollen and so forth.
[54:37.900 --> 54:41.500]  And some of the things, Elson didn't mention it, but some of the things that I've read
[54:41.500 --> 54:47.020]  is that people are suspecting that some of the major insect problems on corn could actually
[54:47.020 --> 54:48.860]  be a problem on hemp too.
[54:49.660 --> 54:53.180]  I don't know the validity of that or whether people are speculating at this point, but
[54:53.180 --> 54:55.420]  things like corn armory worm and some others there.
[54:56.300 --> 55:01.980]  So it is critical that entomologists be looking just like Gary does with the diseases there,
[55:01.980 --> 55:06.780]  that we have entomologists looking at insect problems so that we know what challenges that
[55:06.780 --> 55:07.660]  we have in front of us.
[55:09.980 --> 55:13.020]  So if you have questions about insects, I probably can't answer them, but you can ask.
[55:13.020 --> 55:18.460]  I would think that the insect pressure would build over time once there's more crop available.
[55:18.460 --> 55:19.260]  Absolutely.
[55:19.260 --> 55:20.780]  Same for diseases and insects.
[55:21.660 --> 55:26.860]  As the acreage increases across the state, certainly there's potential for more problems
[55:26.860 --> 55:27.980]  to be there as well.
[55:27.980 --> 55:28.480]  Good point.
[55:29.900 --> 55:31.180]  Other questions or comments?
[55:32.620 --> 55:37.500]  Okay, so I'm going to turn this over then to Dr. Alan Taylor.
[55:38.460 --> 55:42.860]  One of the problems that we've already been confronted with, there's one of these varieties
[55:42.860 --> 55:46.860]  in here, which I think is this short one, is it, Jamie, that had low germination?
[55:47.820 --> 55:48.780]  One of these was, anyway.
[55:48.780 --> 55:49.660]  It was in the five or six.
[55:49.660 --> 55:50.380]  Oh, is it down there?
[55:50.380 --> 55:51.020]  Okay.
[55:51.020 --> 55:55.500]  But one of the varieties was from seed that was a year older than the rest of them, and
[55:55.500 --> 55:57.180]  the germination rate was really low.
[55:57.740 --> 56:01.820]  And even though Jamie compensated with that to have the same number of pure live seeds
[56:01.820 --> 56:06.940]  per square foot, so that we're comparing apples and apples and not apples and oranges, still
[56:06.940 --> 56:11.900]  the stand density was not as great as some of the other varieties.
[56:11.900 --> 56:13.340]  So the seed's important.
[56:13.340 --> 56:16.780]  As Gary said, we need to get a good stand establishment.
[56:16.780 --> 56:21.020]  So we're very pleased that Dr. Alan Taylor from the horticulture section in the School
[56:21.020 --> 56:25.020]  of Integrated Plant Science is working on the seed aspects of this.
[56:25.660 --> 56:27.500]  Thanks, Don, for the introduction.
[56:28.540 --> 56:33.980]  As Chris mentioned, there's a number of states that really have been doing research on hemp.
[56:33.980 --> 56:39.340]  And a colleague of mine from North Dakota State is an agronomist, was giving a talk
[56:39.340 --> 56:45.260]  last year, and really talking about seed quality issues, stand establishment issues,
[56:45.260 --> 56:46.620]  a lot of these seed-related things.
[56:46.620 --> 56:51.980]  And my program here at Cornell at the Geneva Ag Experiment Station, we interact with a
[56:51.980 --> 56:55.580]  lot of different crops, vegetable crops, but also industrial crops.
[56:55.580 --> 57:02.140]  So I thought at the time, I said, this would be really a good project for my laboratory
[57:02.140 --> 57:03.660]  to get involved in.
[57:03.660 --> 57:05.900]  And then here, less than a year later, here we are.
[57:06.460 --> 57:11.660]  Whereas Chris says we have this Cornell hemp team, it's really a consortium of faculty
[57:12.460 --> 57:15.580]  with a wide range of expertise, all kind of focused on this.
[57:15.580 --> 57:20.860]  So I think we're going to be able to make quite a bit of progress in a relatively short
[57:20.860 --> 57:23.580]  amount of time as we're working on this.
[57:23.580 --> 57:30.300]  Also, as Chris mentioned, really good partnership with Ag Ed Markets and things like that, and
[57:30.300 --> 57:35.820]  being able to kind of work at the regulatory level with this and getting it out, as well
[57:35.820 --> 57:39.820]  as the research and the outreach that we're really so good at here at Cornell.
[57:41.260 --> 57:45.980]  We obviously see, as we're looking at here, that with seed, obviously the plant breeding
[57:45.980 --> 57:50.380]  and genetics has a key role in what the plant growth and development is.
[57:50.380 --> 57:56.380]  But another key aspect of seed is the seed quality, and really the quality assurance.
[57:56.380 --> 58:01.660]  As you're buying seed, if you're spending at least $50 an acre to establish, it's a
[58:01.660 --> 58:07.420]  major input into growing really a field crop, like as an agronomic crop as hemp would be.
[58:08.460 --> 58:12.860]  So you want to make sure that you're really, first of all, getting the good quality seed.
[58:14.780 --> 58:21.660]  As right now, for these trials, we have all the grain types or the multi-purpose types
[58:21.660 --> 58:24.380]  here, and there's also other trials with the fiber types.
[58:24.380 --> 58:27.500]  We have 17 seed lots that we're working on.
[58:28.860 --> 58:34.300]  About half of those are from Canada, the rest are from Europe, from Eastern Europe, Poland,
[58:34.300 --> 58:38.140]  Ukraine, over to Italy, France, are the production, the origin of those seeds.
[58:38.940 --> 58:42.700]  So we're looking at a pretty good kind of cross-section of commercial seed.
[58:43.420 --> 58:48.460]  All those seeds have to be imported here into the United States, so there are aspects that
[58:48.460 --> 58:54.780]  really need to be addressed as far as the quality for that sort of commerce coming into this country.
[58:56.140 --> 58:58.860]  There's really two aspects of seed quality.
[58:58.860 --> 59:01.180]  We always think, well, the seed's got to germinate to grow.
[59:01.900 --> 59:06.300]  Definitely the case, but another aspect, especially those that are not involved with
[59:06.300 --> 59:12.220]  agronomic crops or different seeded crops, is what we call the seed purity.
[59:12.220 --> 59:16.300]  What the purity is, is if you're buying a bag of seed, and that could be a bag of wheat,
[59:16.300 --> 59:21.100]  could be a bag of hemp seeds, is what else is in that bag?
[59:21.100 --> 59:26.700]  You want, for example, down there, you want the hemp, this is the Anka variety, but what else could be in that bag?
[59:27.260 --> 59:32.060]  There could be weed seeds present, there could be other crop seeds present,
[59:32.940 --> 59:37.900]  and also what we just generically call is inert material, just other materials, could be broken
[59:37.900 --> 59:41.100]  seeds, trash materials, stones, things like that.
[59:41.660 --> 59:47.660]  So in the 17 seed lots that we're working with now, Michael Luce, who works in my program,
[59:47.660 --> 59:51.980]  he was the former manager of our New York State seed testing laboratory,
[59:51.980 --> 59:57.420]  and that seed testing laboratory has now moved to Albany, but with Michael's actually running the
[59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.460]  germinations and the purities on those, we're seeing some of these seed lots, and again,
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:07.180]  I don't have enough data right now, we're still doing this to have as a handout, but some of
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:11.980]  these over five percent inert material, so basically we say it's pretty trashy seed that
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.980]  we're getting. Again, if somebody's buying this, you want to make sure that you're getting good
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:22.700]  quality seed. But probably the two keys that we're really concerned about in this purity are weed
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:29.740]  seeds. For us to import seeds, to receive the seeds, there has to be an APHIS permit conducted,
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:34.620]  where that what we call a noxious weed exam. Noxious weeds are seeds which are really defined
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.140]  by law that are harmful to agriculture, so you don't want to have those in the bag because you're
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:45.500]  also planting those. And also just other common weed seeds, things like that that may also be
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:51.260]  present. So we're going through these samples right now in just kind of testing, trying to
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:58.540]  get as much information on the quality aspect. For example, the Canadian seed lots that we've
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:04.300]  gotten, as they're close partners to us, they have their seed certification system, just like Phil
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:11.100]  has a seed certification program here. The basis of the two programs are the same as we look at
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.980]  seed certification. They have different levels. They have a certification number one level and
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:23.500]  number two. So how do those differ? They really differ based on the quality. The level one is the
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:31.980]  high quality seed, and so the germination needs to be 85 percent or higher, and just two weed seeds
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:37.660]  can be present in just one other crop seed in a 25 gram sample. Where are these other crop seeds
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:44.140]  coming from you ask? We do not have a herbicide that can be used in the seed production field,
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:51.260]  so if there was oats, and we've seen oats as contaminants as other crop seeds, sunflower,
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.220]  a lot of those seeds are also coming over in your seed. So again, we want that to be as clean as
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:06.300]  possible. Just as we've, again let's use that criteria with the 85 percent germination and the
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:14.060]  70 percent germination. Of the 17 seed lots that is being tested within the Cornell system this year,
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:22.780]  only five of those had 85 percent germination and higher. So again, we really need to have
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:28.700]  high quality seeds for that good initial stand establishment. Nine of those, which is about half,
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:34.380]  had over 70 percent. So again, what you know when this events up to be a commercial crop,
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:39.980]  what you're getting is very important because that really starts the basis for that. So that's kind of
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:45.020]  where we're at right now is in this, I'll say characterization, the quality assurance aspect to
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:52.780]  make sure that the farmer ultimately has high quality seed. The next part is, it's already been
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:03:00.300]  mentioned, there are issues, early germination events, early seedling emergence stand establishment
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:06.140]  issues with the hemp crop. And again, I learned from this from my colleagues in out of state, so this is
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.500]  not a New York problem. It's not unique to us. They have the problems in Canada. They have it throughout.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:19.580]  The seeds in themselves, I'll just say, are just have generally a low vigor. They tend to be
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:27.180]  weak germinators. Once they get going, you can see they grow like heck, but that early phase, which is a
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:33.020]  very, very sensitive phase, and we need to get the plant establishment again for that crop to canopy,
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:39.100]  which is providing the weed management as well. So everything really rotates on getting off to a
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:48.220]  good start with the hemp seed. Now since we're not able to use, labeled of chemical pesticides,
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:55.500]  including chemical seed treatments, then my laboratory is interested from the research
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.220]  point of view of looking at some development of some technology. So that'll be kind of where we're
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:08.620]  going with our research. Two areas, one is Gary mentioned a lot of the the damping off organisms
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:14.940]  that are going to be ubiquitous in our soils here, pythiums, things like that. What sort of a
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:21.900]  seed treatment could we use? Not a chemical seed treatment like a Kaptan or Thiram or an Apron,
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:28.060]  but what else could we use that we could still apply? And so we're kind of going to our toolbox
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:32.620]  where I work with organic vegetable seed productions, and not seed production, but seed
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:38.380]  quality as well, and so what can we take from that area as an organic seed treatment? So that's an
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:45.420]  area that we're going to be moving into that so we can get some protection from some of these early
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:54.860]  attacking, early soil-borne pathogens. The second aspect is again, they are inherently low vigor
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:05:01.900]  seeds, and again we don't know enough yet to really to be able to really define the vigor except
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:07.660]  doing a germination test, but we're relying on on people that have worked in this crop for a long
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:13.500]  time. So in that regards, again kind of some other work that we're doing is what we're calling
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.860]  biostimulants. Biostimulants are compounds, these are not pesticides, that are applied to plants to
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.980]  enhance plant growth and development. So we've already done work with seed treatments with some
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:30.140]  of these biostimulant type of materials, natural type of materials, no pesticidal effect on them at
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:37.260]  all. What would they do to a hemp seed? So again, you know we have a lot to do ahead of us, so we'll
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:42.540]  be ready for next growing season to actually to test some of these things. But that kind of gives
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:48.140]  you in kind of a quick summary where the seed science and technology program is at the Geneva
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:54.700]  Ag Experiment Station with Cornell. Focusing right now in the seed testing aspects, seed quality,
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:06:01.020]  just to make sure we can characterize the seed lots that we're working with, but then the future
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:05.980]  research and development really kind of rolling up our sleeves and developing some very practical
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:11.340]  seed treatments that could be used on hemp seeds to enhance plant establishment and early season
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:25.630]  growth. Thank you. Any questions along the seed line? Yes? I'm surprised by the substantial
[01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:32.830]  reduction in germination from that 2017 to 2016 lots. It was my understanding that that 2016 lot
[01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:37.150]  was the one that needed to have the seeding rate adjusted, and I'm wondering if that's
[01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:42.990]  somewhat more unique to hemp, maybe because of the high oil content? Because most other crops I'm
[01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:48.990]  familiar with didn't show such a dramatic difference between just one year as long as that seed was handled
[01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:55.070]  reasonably well. A really good question, and we're looking at the issues of seed quality, but also in
[01:06:55.070 --> 01:07:02.910]  the case if we have carryover seeds, things like that. There are kind of as we look kind of
[01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:09.470]  across the board of seeds, some seeds are just naturally short-lived seed, like a soybean happens
[01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:14.750]  to be a short-lived seed. Other crops just tend to be like a tomato seed is a very long-lived. So there's
[01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:21.790]  just sort of like my lifespan compared to my pet dog. The dog has a shorter natural lifespan
[01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:27.470]  than I do, so you have some of that. So the hemp kind of fits into that as far as just the genetic
[01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:33.630]  basis. It is a high oil content seeds, but some seeds, so there's not a strict rule of thumb on
[01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:38.510]  oil content. For example, the tomato seeds, which is a very long-lived seed, is a very high oil or lipid
[01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:44.430]  content seed. So there's a lot of things we really don't know, but from again kind of what we
[01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:52.510]  have seen is that the storage, especially in a carryover situation, can be an issue. And so for
[01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:58.430]  example, these companies that we've talked about up in Canada, the seeds that they're producing last
[01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:02.430]  year, the seeds that we're using, so they're produced, harvested, they have to be carried over.
[01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:08.990]  Of these three seed lots of Anka that we got, all the same variety, three different seed lots,
[01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:16.510]  this is from their germination conducted up in Canada. Two are in the upper 80s, one is in the 70.
[01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:23.230]  And I said, why, you know, in a nice sort of a way, why did that happen? Are these carryover
[01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:27.550]  seeds? And they said, no, they're all harvested. One was harvested a little later and may have had a
[01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:32.670]  little bit higher moisture content that went into that overwinter storage. That higher moisture,
[01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:38.830]  the seeds are just going to age faster. So there is just, so you can't even say variety how things
[01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:42.830]  are going to respond. You really have to look at the seed lot level. But even like I said in the
[01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:50.350]  example where we have lots and lots of that seeds for the commercial use this year, there are
[01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:55.150]  differences between those three seed lots. And again, they are attributing it just to that it's
[01:08:55.150 --> 01:09:00.350]  higher moisture content. We can check that moisture content. We have, you know, we can look at that,
[01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:06.510]  but after the aging has happened in seed storage, there's nothing, we can't go retro on this, but
[01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:12.750]  at least we can characterize that as knowing what the moisture should be and safe storage. Very good
[01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:20.830]  question. Thank you. Yes sir? Moisture content, is that dictated by when you harvest? Early harvest,
[01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:26.270]  more moisture, late harvest, less moisture as an example? Is that possible? So what is going on
[01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:32.990]  during seed development and the later phases of seed development is the seed on the mother plant
[01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:40.030]  is drying down. What they would like to do is ideally harvest at the right moisture content,
[01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:44.750]  and then that could go right into storage. However, if it is immature seed, it's going to
[01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:51.150]  have a higher moisture, or if it's rained or so, so that seed moisture is just going up and down
[01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:56.270]  with whatever the environment is going on. So if it's a high relative humidity, or if there's
[01:09:56.270 --> 01:10:00.590]  wetness, it's going to be picking up moisture from there. So the ideal thing is that you want
[01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:04.590]  to harvest at the right moisture content and then go into the storage and things like that.
[01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:08.670]  Have you determined what that moisture content is? I only have some things that I've written,
[01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:13.790]  but we've not actually characterized that, so I don't want to speculate on that right now,
[01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:22.350]  but thank you. That's a good point, because again, generally when we're in more of the seed buyer,
[01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:29.390]  right now New York is not a seed producer, we really are relying on what has happened upstream
[01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:34.030]  with the seed companies, what they've done with seed processing or what we call seed conditioning,
[01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:41.790]  sorting the seeds, doing things like that. And I just want to hit one other point on seed size.
[01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:47.070]  Again, as we're doing this purity, we look at the seeds, we're also taking, we have a thousand seed
[01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:53.230]  weight or thousand kernel weight they call it, but you do see varietal differences. Some are just
[01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:57.950]  larger seed than others, but even within the sample we have, there's a large difference in
[01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:03.230]  seed size. There's small seeds, medium seeds, large seeds, and again we want uniformity of
[01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:08.350]  germination, we want uniformity of stand establishment. That does not set us on the right
[01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:14.030]  foot if we're already starting off with a wide range of seed sciences within the same seed lot.
[01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:18.910]  So again, something else we need to kind of look at a little bit there too.
[01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:25.790]  Any other kind of, yes sir? So just with your other grain and crops you have seed
[01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:31.070]  foundation here that checks for quality and de-inerts and everything else.
[01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:38.830]  To me it looks like the hemp is kind of a rogue introduction to the seed industry and I would
[01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:44.430]  suspect that importing these seeds from other countries similar to grain, you're going to have
[01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:50.830]  those imperfections, you're going to have those variations. So I'm assuming APHIS, Ag and Markets,
[01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:56.590]  seed foundation, they're going to work at developing some basic standards for the seed,
[01:11:56.590 --> 01:12:01.070]  or is this just going to be an open quarrel mine, whatever comes in?
[01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:09.550]  Multiple points that you're making and all really good ones, because the bottom line is we want to
[01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:14.510]  assure a New York grower that's going to be planting the hemp that they have good quality
[01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:21.390]  seed. I think if we look at Canada, Canada started this in 1998, so they've been doing,
[01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:26.830]  they've been growing hemp for many years and these seed companies I would say are pretty mature.
[01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:32.430]  They're not mon pod type of companies that are just going out here whacking some seeds off and
[01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:39.150]  threshing them out and selling them. Now these are big operations and when we're buying a 750
[01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:44.510]  kilogram totes of those that are coming in, that's a big seed production facility that they have.
[01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:50.510]  I've not seen it, but they're very mature in that. They also have their own seed certification
[01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:57.070]  standards. For example, to make that number one certified has to have the high germination of 85
[01:12:57.070 --> 01:13:02.430]  or better, but just a few seeds. Now if it turns out, let's say just one other crop seed and then
[01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:08.830]  two weed seeds, if that sample they pull has four weed seeds in it, even though the germination is
[01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:14.190]  90 percent, it drops it down automatically to their certified level number two. The grower
[01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:19.790]  doesn't really know that. They just know it's a level two certification, it's a lower grade.
[01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:25.390]  They don't know why they have it, but we can track that down and know. So I think in their
[01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:32.510]  system they're using both the purity as a criteria for high quality and the germination. And it's a
[01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:37.150]  good system. It's a little different than what we do here in the states, but it is a good system so
[01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:41.230]  you know if you're getting that number one certified that you're getting very good seed.
[01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:48.510]  Yes sir? So the numbers you gave us earlier on the rates of germination, those were provided
[01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:56.510]  by the vendor at their certified levels? Okay there's two things. So when I talked about the
[01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:01.710]  ANCA, the three seed lots of ANCA, I don't even have the third seed lot yet. Everything's pretty
[01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:07.630]  pretty new and then it's not only 50 miles from Ithaca to Geneva, but it's just cumbersome,
[01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:13.070]  I'll just put it that way, and moving seeds around even within the Cornell system. So we have not done
[01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:19.870]  any of the testing on these three ANCA lots. What I'm saying is we do have samples from all of these
[01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:25.070]  types along with four other fiber types. That is where we did the actual germination and we're
[01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:30.270]  doing the purity right now. We're that new into this. When we have this field day two weeks from
[01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:35.870]  today in Geneva, I'm going to be able to talk more than I can now just because we're generating
[01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:42.510]  the data as we speak. So you'll be able to compare that data to what they certified? That's ultimately what I want to be able to do.
[01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:49.790]  Yeah, is we're taking out of a little baggie a sample compared to them going through their
[01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:54.910]  large inventory. So we want to make sure that what we're saying is representative, not that
[01:14:54.910 --> 01:15:01.550]  anybody's right or wrong, it's just being really representative. Yeah, exactly. Good. Yes?
[01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:09.790]  I'm not sure if there's patent laws or things like that surrounding seed. So say somebody took a
[01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:14.430]  headed one of your plants here and took the seed and replanted it, what kind of repercussions would
[01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:20.430]  there be? Those are more the legal aspects and we kind of talked about some of that, but basically
[01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:26.430]  it's not legal. You'd be dealing with trespass in addition to the patent laws. Yeah, so there's
[01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:33.390]  I'll say multiple issues around doing something like that. Right, so how is Cornell able to import it? Is it under the context of research?
[01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:38.990]  Jamie really did a yeoman's job of doing this. Jamie, you want to talk on
[01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:46.670]  acquiring the seeds for Cornell? I think Chris is going to cover all of the regulatory stuff.
[01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:52.510]  Okay, okay, perfect, perfect. Let's stay tuned and we'll get that question answered for you.
[01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:58.590]  Yes, sir? Did you do a moisture test on the incoming seed from Canada
[01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:00.430]  so you know what least level was there?
[01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:08.190]  We have not gathered that data, but what we do have are the samples that are still in the original
[01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:12.910]  bag so we can go ahead and sample out of that. What we're really concerned about is when we get a small,
[01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:18.190]  when you get a hundred gram sample, which is like a cup full of seeds, and that's in an open porous
[01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:23.390]  container and it's a humid day or a dry day, that's all going to change. So we really need to go back
[01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:28.510]  the best we can to that and then take a deep core out of that. Then we will have a more
[01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:34.030]  representative. But yeah, as you know, as every this whole season kind of progressed and getting
[01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:38.670]  things, there's a lot of woulda, coulda, shouldas, and there always is in doing research, but this
[01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:43.710]  was really a hurry up type of a year to get as far as we are right now. I think next year we'll be
[01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:49.390]  more in place with doing those quality right as soon as we receive the seeds. Excellent point.
[01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:56.030]  We need to be really good seedsmen here on our side as well. Okay, yes ma'am. Do you, do all of
[01:16:56.030 --> 01:17:02.910]  these plants have a THC and CBD profile? Have they been tested yet? And is it available anywhere for
[01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:09.150]  us so we can know what THC quantity or what CBD and what types of CBD? Is it CBD A, CBD B,
[01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:14.590]  just CBD? Do they have, have these varieties been tested for that yet? That's all to be done,
[01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:19.950]  correct? Chris, did you have the question? The question was have all the varieties been tested,
[01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:27.950]  sorry, for THC and CBD levels? And the varieties we're growing here, we'll test here. But in
[01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:34.990]  Canada, there's actually a really informative website, like Ontario Canada fact sheets. And
[01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:39.470]  they have fact sheets that cover lots and lots of different things. And one of the things they have
[01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:46.270]  is a list of varieties and those they found to be low or high THC contents. And I can't remember
[01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:51.710]  off the top of my head if they have CBD in there as well. But that's a very informative site for you.
[01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:04.910]  Thank you. Really, really good questions. And again, there's a lot of unsolved questions,
[01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:09.150]  but we are addressing these. So thank you very much for your comments and questions.
[01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:20.950]  Okay, thank you, Alan. Okay, so our last speaker is Chris Loge, who I really appreciate came the
[01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:26.710]  long distance. I mean, most of us are right here on campus or with Alan a little over an hour away.
[01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:32.470]  But Chris came quite a distance from Albany to be here. Chris is the director of the Division
[01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:36.150]  of Planned Industry in the New York State Department of Agriculture Markets. And he'll
[01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:39.190]  be talking about some of these regulatory issues like the question that was asked,
[01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:45.350]  as well as potential markets here. So thank you very, very much for the opportunity to be here
[01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:50.310]  today. I know I'm going to get lots of questions, so I'm glad I don't have notes that I'm going to
[01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:57.430]  follow. I'm just going to start out a little bit and tell you sort of how we got here. Gary described
[01:18:57.430 --> 01:19:04.870]  himself as a student of hemp diseases. I have become a student of hemp. It's been the school
[01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:10.550]  of hard knocks. There's some people sitting out here that have been very, very helpful to me in
[01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:17.510]  learning about this crop. So it's been a couple of years that we've been working on hemp. And
[01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:21.430]  as all of you know, we started out at the department with a pretty conservative
[01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:29.830]  program that limited our research partners or limited research permits to folks who were
[01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:35.270]  affiliated with colleges and universities and institutions of higher education.
[01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:41.270]  This spring, we were able to open it up and bring some farmers into it and some other folks.
[01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:48.550]  And then, of course, added a number of research partners with the ANCA trial this summer.
[01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:55.030]  So we're definitely sort of on the track towards a more liberal approach to this.
[01:19:55.750 --> 01:20:02.870]  I want to talk a little bit about the authority for any of us to be doing this. So the authority
[01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:11.430]  for any of us to be engaged in this comes from the 2014 Farm Bill. And basically what the 2014
[01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:19.670]  Farm Bill did, and I'll just paraphrase, basically it enabled universities or institutions of higher
[01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:26.070]  education and state departments of agriculture to engage in industrial hemp research pilot
[01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:34.950]  programs. So on the good side, the Farm Bill doesn't define what a pilot research program is,
[01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:40.710]  and it doesn't necessarily define what commercialization is. That in a way is sort of a
[01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:45.110]  double-edged sword. It's a good thing it's not defined. It lets us sort of figure out what the
[01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:49.990]  boundaries are. But I think the other thing that you need to keep in mind if this is something that
[01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:54.790]  you're considering doing, that at some point along the way, somebody might say, hey, you're up
[01:20:54.790 --> 01:21:02.950]  against the fence. You're going too far. And we are dealing quite a bit with Department of Justice
[01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:09.190]  and DEA. And I have to tell you, they've been extremely helpful to us. I think they've been
[01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:15.110]  pretty responsive with Cornell and SUNY Morrisville. But this is out of the ordinary
[01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:21.030]  for them. They regulate controlled substances from cradle to grave. In the case of hemp,
[01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:26.310]  they regulate the seed and then they step away from it. So this is new territory for them as well.
[01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:33.190]  The other piece that I'll throw out there is that the Farm Bill will be up for renewal or
[01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:41.270]  renegotiation in 2018. And so we need to be aware that there could potentially be some changes
[01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:46.150]  in that language in the Farm Bill. And so that's one of the things that's on my tick list
[01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:53.030]  from a policy perspective, working with some of our policy folks in Albany and in Washington, DC,
[01:21:53.030 --> 01:22:00.230]  to make sure that we can continue to move forward. So going forward with the 2018 Farm Bill,
[01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:06.230]  you could see the same language that was in 2014. You could see a step back away from that,
[01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:11.750]  that maybe restricts us more. Or you could see from a federal level, maybe some liberalization.
[01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:17.830]  So we need to be aware of that from the policy perspective. The other thing I'll say on the
[01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:24.710]  federal side is that we had some very high level discussions with some of the federal folks. And
[01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:30.790]  again, frankly, they don't answer a lot of questions directly. So if you start asking
[01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:34.550]  me questions about federal policy, I'm probably going to be a little cagey too.
[01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:42.070]  There is also, if you go on our website, you can check out a number of documents that are very,
[01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:47.910]  very important from a regulatory and an authority perspective. The three things that I would say
[01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:53.430]  you want to be looking at and be aware of on the federal level are the wording of the 2014 Farm
[01:22:53.430 --> 01:23:01.270]  Bill, the wording in the 2016 Omnibus Budget Act, that's very important as well. And then the third
[01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:07.030]  piece is a guidance document from, I think, July or August of last year that came out from DEA,
[01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:12.470]  FDA, and USDA. So those are sort of the three guiding documents that are out there.
[01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:18.710]  There's still a whole lot of gray in this. What we've tried to do as we've moved forward with
[01:23:18.710 --> 01:23:25.030]  this is to build a program that is, if you will, a safe harbor for folks who want to get involved
[01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:31.190]  in this. We want to try to keep you as farmers, growers, processors, what have you, sort of in a
[01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:37.190]  safe place from the federal perspective, but at the same time trying to move this ahead and learn
[01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:46.390]  as much as we possibly can. One thing I do want to actually make sure everybody knows Kate in the
[01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:53.350]  back there. Kate is the person who, if you call our office and you call the HEMP 800 number that
[01:23:53.350 --> 01:24:00.070]  was announced a few weeks ago, you will most likely talk with Kate. And she will, if she can't answer
[01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:04.550]  your question, she's going to take down your information and get the question to somebody
[01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:12.230]  who can help you. So bear with us on that. We're sort of building this as we go. I want to make a
[01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:18.150]  just a quick comment on the trial behind me here. This is probably the best hemp I've seen,
[01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:24.150]  not that I've seen a lot, but I was in Kentucky a couple of weeks ago for the hemp regulatory
[01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:30.710]  conference and we were on several farms and basically we were hearing all the same things
[01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:40.470]  that all the Cornell faculty have said today. Seed quality, emergence, competition with weeds, the lack
[01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:45.830]  of herbicides. If you're in a situation where you would use an herbicide or another crop
[01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:51.990]  protectant on this, we're coming up against all the same issues that have been identified
[01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:59.350]  in other states. So we're learning a lot as we go along. So a little bit about the process going
[01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:06.390]  forward. From an administrative perspective, I've kind of felt for the last two and a half
[01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:10.310]  years like I've been a little bit behind the curve on the timing on this.
[01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:16.790]  And so we're always trying, we're always on a scramble to get things done. And so our goal
[01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:26.950]  going forward this year is, for 2018 I should say, is to try to roll out the application process
[01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:33.670]  very, very soon. And so I'm going to throw some dates out there. Please don't come call me if
[01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:39.590]  this doesn't come true and give me a hard time. I'd like it to open up for applications during
[01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:44.550]  the month of August. That's this month, probably towards the end of the month because we've got
[01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:50.230]  some vacations and some other professional meetings that we, our staff, are engaged in.
[01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:58.070]  And what that would do is basically we'd probably leave that application period open for
[01:25:58.710 --> 01:26:04.790]  several months, maybe into the middle or end of October. That's going to give folks adequate time
[01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:09.510]  to develop their research plan. And again, I keep circling back around to that farm bill.
[01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:13.990]  That allows us to do research, not commercialization. So the thing that I'm going to
[01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:19.030]  weigh most heavily on an application is what's your research plan? What are you going to be
[01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:25.430]  able to bring to the table to offer as far as new knowledge or knowledge gained? And that,
[01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:30.870]  again, we take a very, very broad approach to research. It can be agronomic. It can be
[01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:36.550]  pest management. It can be marketing. It can be product development.
[01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:41.830]  You name it. You can probably make the argument that it's research.
[01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:49.750]  So basically getting that out there, August, September, October of this year is going to give
[01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:55.430]  you folks time to develop a good plan. It's going to give you time to start talking with
[01:26:55.430 --> 01:27:02.710]  your seed suppliers in Canada, the European Union, wherever you decide you're going to get your seed
[01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:10.470]  from. And it also gives us a little bit more time. We actually applied for our DEA import permit on
[01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:19.190]  March 17th of this year. And the DEA came out, I think, on June 27th or something. And they
[01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:25.510]  interviewed several of us. They took all of our personal information, names of our eldest children,
[01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:30.710]  where they were located, all that kind of good stuff. And so we're waiting on our permit.
[01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:38.870]  So next year, hopefully that permit will be in place soon. I'd like it to be in place before
[01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:42.790]  we go out with our application for 2018. I don't know if that's realistic or not.
[01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:48.310]  So once that permit is in place, that's going to give us the opportunity at the department
[01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:56.070]  to play the role of the importer. So what that means is if you were a research partner with the
[01:27:56.070 --> 01:28:03.110]  department in 2018, you would figure out what seed variety you wanted or varieties you wanted. You
[01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:08.710]  would talk with the seed company, Canada, the European Union, wherever, and make all the
[01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:14.630]  arrangements, financial, shipping, what have you, to get the seed into the country. And when it's
[01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:19.350]  imported, it would be delivered to Albany. And at that point, you would come to Albany and pick it
[01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:25.270]  up. We would release it to you. So that's kind of what we're looking at going forward. So we're
[01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:33.430]  hoping for a much more streamlined process. Definitely invested in this. I want to be as
[01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:41.110]  helpful as we can to folks. A couple things from the processing perspective. That was the other
[01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:48.710]  thing that I was asked to talk about today. So two things I think I want to sort of talk a little
[01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:55.270]  bit about. Sort of what I think of what's going on in the industry. I kind of look at the two major
[01:28:55.270 --> 01:29:01.590]  issues that I think are facing us. Almost like a set of bookends. You got the seed issue,
[01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:09.590]  okay. And we've talked about a lot of the physical attributes of the seed as far as seed quality,
[01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:15.110]  emergence, all that type of thing. You have the political, the regulatory aspects of it. Where can
[01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:22.470]  you get it? It's hard to get into the country, okay. Need a lot of permits. So if this industry's
[01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:29.510]  going to move forward, I think the plant breeding program and getting a domestic seed supply. And
[01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:34.790]  when I say domestic seed supply, I mean the seed supply within the borders of New York State,
[01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:39.190]  where this product is under the state's authority, is really, really important.
[01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:45.430]  I'm not a plant breeder, but I do have a background in horticulture. I think we all have to realize
[01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:52.630]  that's not going to happen overnight, okay. I've had a bunch of questions here and I heard some
[01:29:52.630 --> 01:30:01.590]  questions here today about feral stands of hemp. And so that's definitely something that's sort of
[01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:07.670]  on our radar screen. We got to understand what that is. So that feral hemp that's out there,
[01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:14.710]  that could be something else. We don't know. Probably hasn't been tested for THC,
[01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:21.670]  number one. Number two, we need to understand what the genetics of it are. So it could be
[01:30:21.670 --> 01:30:26.150]  the foundation for a really good breeding program or it might be something that we don't want,
[01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:31.430]  okay. And so it's going to take some time to understand what that is, okay.
[01:30:33.190 --> 01:30:39.670]  The other bookend that I think is really, really important is the processing and the marketing,
[01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:45.510]  okay. So that's the other thing that is potentially a little bit risky and where we need to do a lot
[01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:51.270]  more work and have a better understanding of what this plant and what this industry can do.
[01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:56.790]  And you know, there's some of you here that have known me for a while. I was in extension for over
[01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:01.190]  20 years and actually this isn't very much different than any other crop. I talked with
[01:31:01.190 --> 01:31:05.510]  a hemp farmer the other day and I said, hey, I'm going to tell you the exact same thing. I talked
[01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:11.990]  to people 20 years about strawberries, greenhouse flowers, whatever. We can teach you how to grow
[01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:17.910]  this, but we can't necessarily teach you how to sell it, how to market it. That part of it, you
[01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:23.590]  guys have to really sort of take the ball and run with that to a certain extent. So what we're
[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:29.590]  working on as far as marketing is concerned is we have in our division of ag development, we have
[01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:36.310]  some staff who do work on marketing efforts and we're at least taking the step of moving forward,
[01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:42.870]  identifying processors within the state of New York. Because again, relatively easy. If you've
[01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:48.710]  got some hemp product, you can in relative, with relative ease, move it about within the borders
[01:31:48.710 --> 01:31:54.790]  of the state. We're also identifying processors outside the state of New York. And so at least
[01:31:54.790 --> 01:32:01.270]  we'll have a resource list available to you that folks can look at. And then the other thing is,
[01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:07.030]  I believe yesterday or the day before, Empire State Development came out with some processor
[01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:13.990]  grants. So there are some funds available to help to spur the processing industry. And so if you call
[01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:19.670]  us at the department and talk with Kate, I'm pretty sure you do have a, you've got a contact
[01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:31.990]  person at ESD now. So we have someone we can refer you to. CEDE. Certification. Yes, thank you.
[01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:40.070]  The other thing that's on our tick list coming out of the bill signing and the summit and really
[01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:45.830]  related to my comments about developing a domestic within the borders of New York seed industry.
[01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:52.550]  One of the things that we really have high on our list to do is to develop some seed certification
[01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:57.910]  standards. So we've got, if you look in the Ag and Markets Law, there are seed certification
[01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:02.470]  standards for all kinds of different crops that we grow. We work closely with the folks here
[01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:09.510]  at New York State Seed Improvement and Cornell when we develop those standards. But that's going
[01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:15.030]  to be very, very important. And really what it comes down to, as Dr. Taylor said, in a nutshell,
[01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:20.790]  is sort of consumer protection for the people who are buying that seed. Okay. And that's really going
[01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:27.830]  to set the stage for developing that industry along with development of some genetics that
[01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:35.990]  are good for New York as well as good for the various uses of industrial hemp. With that,
[01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:42.790]  I can answer some questions. I'm sure there will be some. There always are. Yes, sir.
[01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:49.910]  With respect to the 2018 Farm Bill, what are the political pressure points that can be used to make
[01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:57.670]  sure it's motivated in a favorable direction? So the question was in regards to the 2018 Farm Bill,
[01:33:57.670 --> 01:34:04.070]  what are the pressure points as far as a favorable outcome? I think one of the things with
[01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:10.150]  anything at a federal level, and again, hemp is a very small piece of, well, actually not. It's a
[01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:14.470]  very large piece of what I've been doing over the last couple of years. But we've got a lot of other
[01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:18.630]  issues where we're dealing with the federal government. And I would just say in general,
[01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:31.190]  there's a lot of anxiety among sort of middle management folks and federal agencies. Not
[01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:38.870]  necessarily a great deal of direction. I would say one thing that we may have from a favorable
[01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:45.910]  perspective is Kentucky is a big state in hemp. And so you have Mitch McConnell with a leadership
[01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:55.670]  position in Congress. And so that potentially helps with the whole hemp situation. But I think
[01:34:57.350 --> 01:35:02.790]  trying to predict what the pressure points are is pretty hard with how things have been working at
[01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:11.270]  the federal level at this point. So the question is, is it on the New York delegation? And I think
[01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:16.470]  there's been quite a bit of interest from the New York delegation from my perspective. Donna,
[01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:32.990]  do you have something you want to add to that? Yeah. So we were just with Senator Gillibrand
[01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:40.510]  recently, and she's one of the main sponsors of the 2018 Industrial Hemp Farming Act. So our hope
[01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:47.550]  is that because of the interest from largely from Kentucky, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell and others,
[01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:52.750]  and the widespread support in places across the country where it's growing, that we can get around
[01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:58.590]  those pressure points by just pressuring for full passage of legalization. We think that
[01:35:59.470 --> 01:36:07.390]  is looking much more likely than it's ever before. I'm not positive how many of our New York
[01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:13.710]  congressmen have signed on. Last year I think we had five. And our congressman
[01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:19.790]  has recently retired, so he's not on the bill at the moment. But yeah, that's our goal. The
[01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:24.190]  goal is to pass the Industrial Hemp Farming Act and just make everybody's lives a lot easier.
[01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:29.390]  I'll stick around in case you guys want to. Okay. Thank you. Yes, sir. Yeah, I've got a question
[01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:36.670]  regarding the Farm Bill. Do you know why there's so much effort by the DEA and play on words when
[01:36:36.670 --> 01:36:44.990]  it comes to the CBD extract part of the plant? If they try to make it like it's THC, we know it's
[01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:51.070]  not THC. They play around a lot of words. And I've read... Are you talking about the rescheduling?
[01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:57.150]  No, not just the rescheduling. Well, yes, rescheduling, but also as part of the Farm Act,
[01:36:57.150 --> 01:37:04.590]  they're trying to delineate the CBD. And it doesn't sound favorable right now. So a couple
[01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:10.590]  things is there are even some states, and as I said, I was in Kentucky two weeks ago for the
[01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:16.990]  regulatory conference, which basically was pretty much limited to folks from state departments of
[01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:21.790]  agriculture. There were a few extension people there as presenters as well. So it was a pretty
[01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:31.390]  open exchange and forum. And even some of the states have defined industrial hemp as grain
[01:37:31.390 --> 01:37:40.990]  and fiber only and have limited CBD research. At the federal level, I think there's again
[01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:49.630]  a little bit of a disconnect perhaps, if you will, because some of those products
[01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:58.350]  have not necessarily had clinical trials on them. And so there's a hesitancy to move forward with
[01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:07.470]  them. And again, I kind of would go back, and I'm not going to poke another agency.
[01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:14.830]  DEA has been pretty helpful to us. DEA has been pretty helpful, I think, to Cornell and Morrisville.
[01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:23.870]  I think going back to my previous statement, regulatory officials
[01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:31.230]  look for black and white. And there's not a lot of black and white in this. And so when you have
[01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:37.790]  a DEA investigator or someone in a leadership position at DEA, and it doesn't fit neatly
[01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:43.390]  into how they've defined other substances, they really struggle with that. And so I think
[01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:51.070]  it's sort of a discovery or a process of trying to figure out what's what. We've taken a little
[01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:58.750]  bit more liberal approach on the CBD end of things. But we've also had a lot of discussions
[01:38:58.750 --> 01:39:05.790]  with our State Department of Health over the past six months about CBD. And they're in a role where
[01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:12.430]  they're going to be backing us up on a technical perspective. Because as I say to my boss,
[01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:20.110]  do you want an entomologist, a forester, and somebody with a dairy science background
[01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:25.870]  to be evaluating projects that might have medical or health implications? It's out of
[01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:30.670]  my wheelhouse. If you start to talk to me about the agronomy or the pest management,
[01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:36.030]  I can probably look at that pretty easily and tell if it's a good project, a worthy project.
[01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:42.830]  If I have questions, I have probably 11 folks at Cornell who can help me out with that.
[01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:48.510]  You start getting into some of the CBD stuff and start to make health claims and that type of
[01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:53.230]  thing. And even to some extent, nutritional claims, we don't necessarily have the backstop
[01:39:53.230 --> 01:40:01.070]  for that right now. And so we're developing that. How about you? Hey, how's it going? Good.
[01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:07.790]  Based on that line of what we're just talking about now, what is New York State's definition
[01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:15.630]  then of medical CBD marijuana versus what I'm looking at right now, which is hemp with CBD
[01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:22.190]  oil in it? What's the difference there? Is it a gray area? Thank you for saying it's a gray area
[01:40:22.190 --> 01:40:27.550]  because it is a gray area. We're trying to figure that out. One of the things that's a little bit of
[01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:34.350]  a challenge is within the medical marijuana program, there are very strict quality control
[01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:39.470]  standards in there, very strict production standards. That's not stuff that we have in the
[01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:46.590]  hemp, current industrial hemp regulations. It's not something that frankly is in the next iteration
[01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:53.950]  of the industrial hemp regulations. But we're working on trying to define where those regulatory
[01:40:53.950 --> 01:41:00.990]  boundaries are and when other agencies have to be brought in. We don't want to get in trouble and
[01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:06.190]  we don't want anybody that's sitting here in the audience to get in difficulty with either another
[01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:12.030]  state agency or a federal agency. And so I think a little bit of patience, a little bit of working
[01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:19.950]  through it, and we'll certainly get there. I have a little experience in hemp and marijuana and medical
[01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:26.190]  marijuana. As a police officer, I might not be confused by some of these taller varieties, but I
[01:41:26.190 --> 01:41:31.150]  definitely would be confused with the smaller varieties, not just based on its look, but based
[01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:36.030]  on its smell, its texture, and that essentially there's not real, there's that gray area.
[01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:42.030]  So is Ag and Markets, when people are applying for these applications, helping them reach out to their
[01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:47.310]  local police to make sure that they're aware? I know we have a sign, but my neighbors would probably
[01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:51.790]  read that sign and just report me for growing marijuana. So the question was, what about
[01:41:53.390 --> 01:42:00.510]  working with law enforcement as far as on industrial hemp? And so I don't have the regulations in front
[01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:06.910]  of me, but basically what we currently have in the regulations and definitely is going into the
[01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:13.390]  next version is a requirement for when you get your industrial hemp research authorization from
[01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:18.750]  the department, you have a certain amount of time to reach out to your local law enforcement agency
[01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:26.830]  and let them know that you have this permit. And so each of the original 10 authorization holders
[01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:32.750]  have done that and they report back to us that they've completed it. Oftentimes they send us a
[01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:36.830]  copy of the letter or give a reference to a phone call or what have you that happened.
[01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:45.630]  And interestingly enough, we've gotten questions on it. We had somebody actually call in and it came,
[01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:52.110]  I don't think it came to my desk, I think it came to Tim's desk, and came to his desk as,
[01:42:52.110 --> 01:42:57.870]  you have an industrial hemp call. Well, it was a county sheriff and a fisherman had
[01:42:57.870 --> 01:43:03.710]  scampered up from the riverbank and apparently had walked some distance from where he
[01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:10.030]  started fishing and he came up in something that looked like this and he called the police.
[01:43:10.670 --> 01:43:16.430]  And so that particular authorization holder had talked with somebody within the
[01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:21.630]  county sheriff's department, but some of the word hadn't gone through the whole organization. So we
[01:43:21.710 --> 01:43:27.870]  were able to take that call and answer it. We also have had calls from New York State Police
[01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:32.830]  Intelligence Unit because some of our authorization holders have sent the license in.
[01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:40.430]  The license looks like our plant life, plant industry, plant dealer or plant grower license.
[01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:47.470]  And when you photocopy it, the security paper, the watermark doesn't show up. And so they
[01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:52.830]  rightfully questioned whether it was the real deal or not. Did you want to add something, Donna?
[01:43:55.950 --> 01:44:05.310]  Two things, just for reference. Binghamton University has 15,000 CBD rich plants in the
[01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:11.710]  ground in a raised bed format. They're doing a different type of grow. Their plants were imported
[01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:18.830]  as cuttings from Kentucky. That is IP protected material that's been cut and cloned.
[01:44:19.630 --> 01:44:25.630]  And the local sheriff was very interested to come and see what was going on. But we've had
[01:44:25.630 --> 01:44:31.310]  across the board support from law enforcement, largely because when they understand the issue
[01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:37.790]  of cross pollination, this does have an impact on illegally grown marijuana, which makes them
[01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:42.350]  very happy. Some of us not so much, but some people are not happy about it.
[01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:50.990]  Yes. And since Donna brought up Kentucky, I guess I should address that issue. So if you look at the
[01:44:53.630 --> 01:45:01.150]  US Department of Justice guidance and you look at the three agency guidance document from a year
[01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:09.870]  ago, it expressly forbids the movement of plants and seeds among states. However, there's another
[01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:19.950]  document that says industrial hemp can move among states that have state authorized programs.
[01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:27.870]  And so the guidance document doesn't necessarily have force of law behind it. I will tell you
[01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:34.910]  that the DEA is fully aware that plants and seeds are coming from Kentucky and Colorado and Oregon.
[01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:43.470]  The department's not going to facilitate that, but we are not at this point going to forbid you
[01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:48.350]  from doing that. I think that will probably continue to be a question that we wrestle with
[01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:55.870]  a little bit. Some of the other states that we interfaced with down in Kentucky,
[01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:02.750]  basically were saying, well, once you do that, you don't kind of know what you're getting into your state.
[01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:09.390]  And so potentially you have some issues going forward from a regulatory perspective. So if you
[01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:16.510]  do that, you're doing it at your own risk. And anybody who's a current authorization holder has
[01:46:17.230 --> 01:46:22.190]  read all of the releases and signed the forms, anybody that applies, you'll see the
[01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:26.190]  paperwork that's involved in this. Sir?
[01:46:28.670 --> 01:46:32.750]  One of my wife's Canadian relatives involved in the hemp industry up there,
[01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:39.230]  he said a nightly occurrence, car pulls up, jumps the fence, whack a few bushes, back in the car,
[01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:45.470]  and away they go. As a grower or possessor of hemp in New York through this program, what are my legal
[01:46:46.190 --> 01:46:52.190]  responsibilities should that happen on my farm? Go back to bed, call the cops? This is getting
[01:46:52.190 --> 01:46:59.470]  out into the community, even whatever it's in. So first off, I'm not an attorney.
[01:47:00.110 --> 01:47:07.790]  I'm a plant industry director. But what I would say is, if I held a research authorization
[01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:16.510]  and that was happening, I would first, per our regulation, you've already got a relationship
[01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:20.830]  with your local law enforcement. That's part of the reason we want you to call if you have
[01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:25.710]  our research authorization. That's part of the reason we want you to call local law enforcement,
[01:47:25.710 --> 01:47:30.270]  so they know it's there. So they maybe can drive by a little more often if they want to keep an eye
[01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:35.710]  on what's going on, but also so you have a relationship. So I would say you want to call
[01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:40.670]  them and report it. And the other piece of it is, is for whoever's taking it,
[01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:50.030]  they have no legal protection. Once they cross the fence, if I cut one of these now and I went
[01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:57.150]  outside across that fence, I have a controlled substance. And so any law enforcement officer,
[01:47:57.790 --> 01:48:03.950]  because I'm not a research authorization holder in the program, would have every right to stop me.
[01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:11.550]  So I would say you report it and document that as well. Because one of the things that potentially
[01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:17.870]  happens going forward is, is you potentially get into a situation where your neighbor maybe doesn't
[01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:24.750]  like this form of agriculture and decides they want to challenge you on that. So you want to have
[01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:31.710]  a good record that you have been diligent about controlling this product and keeping it
[01:48:32.110 --> 01:48:38.350]  from getting where it shouldn't be. Yes, sir. Kind of a compound question for you here, Chris,
[01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:44.350]  flowing from this one. How do you establish the chain of title or provenance of the product that
[01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:50.510]  you have if you do acquire it by appropriate means and you're a processor, et cetera? Do you need to
[01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:57.070]  have a certification or the bill of sale? What documentation will essentially qualify you to
[01:48:57.070 --> 01:49:03.870]  hold that product? And then you had mentioned earlier that it's fairly easy to move this
[01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:08.270]  product around within the state of New York. That suggests to me that it might be a little bit,
[01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:14.190]  but you also did say identifying processors out of state. So I'm curious, is it something where
[01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:19.790]  the raw product, the raw seed, et cetera, is more difficult to send out of state?
[01:49:20.590 --> 01:49:24.510]  Once it's processed into a product, is that relatively easier to send out?
[01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:31.950]  Sure. So a couple of things. So number one, your first question was how do you establish the chain
[01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:38.350]  of title, correct? And so what we've done up to now is that we have had our authorization holders,
[01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:45.870]  if they're sending a product to processing, we've added that processor as a site under their
[01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:54.430]  existing license. I think what we're going to do going forward is to actually register processors.
[01:49:54.990 --> 01:50:01.470]  And so we don't envision the registration of processors to have a fee attached to it at this
[01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:07.710]  point in time. It's basically, you're filing with us to say you are a hemp processor. That way,
[01:50:07.710 --> 01:50:15.630]  if you are in possession, and really what concerns us is if you were a processor and you're in
[01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:20.590]  possession of any propagative material. So in other words, seed that hasn't been roasted or
[01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:28.030]  denatured or sterilized. We want to have you as a processor have a piece of paper in your hand
[01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:34.910]  that says you're authorized to have that in the event that federal officials came in and asked
[01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:39.710]  why you had that product. The second part of your question?
[01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:46.670]  It was again about the ease of transporting products across state lines, raw product usage.
[01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:52.590]  So if you go back, and again, I don't have the exact wording in my mind, but if you go back to
[01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:58.030]  the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it actually exempts certain parts of the plant, even right
[01:50:58.030 --> 01:51:03.470]  within the Controlled Substances Act. Now, one of the things I will say, and again, I'm not in the
[01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:08.670]  business of poking another agency, especially the DEA, since I need to get a permit from them right
[01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:18.030]  now. If you interpret the Controlled Substances Act literally, you could make the
[01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:25.150]  interpretation that hemp was never illegal. It was just really hard to get the permits for it. In fact,
[01:51:25.150 --> 01:51:34.270]  nobody ever got the permits for it over the past 50 years. So seed and plants, probably pretty
[01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:42.910]  difficult to get from state to state. That's going to pique the interest of the DEA. And I will tell
[01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:49.950]  you in our interviews, they're well aware of what's going on and have what I would say is pretty good
[01:51:49.950 --> 01:52:00.030]  intelligence. The other parts of the plant should move very easily among states that have an
[01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:06.590]  industrial hemp program. North Dakota, I believe last year, ran into some problems where one of
[01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:11.390]  their authorization holders had a large amount of material, and I can't remember what part of the
[01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:19.790]  plant it was, that DEA held for a period of time. And the Department of Agriculture and the DEA
[01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:28.190]  got into a war of letters, and eventually the product was released and went to where it needed
[01:52:28.190 --> 01:52:34.270]  to go. So I think we're going to run into some bumps like that from time to time. And again,
[01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:44.670]  what happened last year, which was I believe in December or January, and talking informally with
[01:52:44.670 --> 01:52:50.910]  my counterpart in North Dakota, his take on it was there was an administration change going on.
[01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:57.630]  There was a lack of clarity as to where this was going, and that somebody at a regional level had
[01:52:57.630 --> 01:53:04.830]  decided to take advantage of that change and try to make an example, so to speak. So I think,
[01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:11.950]  as we move through the 2018 Farm Bill process, we're going to have a much better sense
[01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:18.670]  of what the federal administration is thinking and where we're going on this. Yes, ma'am.
[01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:27.150]  So if you're planting hemp on forested land, because I've had theft on forested property,
[01:53:27.150 --> 01:53:32.910]  and this was handled by the, I guess, the Forestry Department of the state police.
[01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:39.470]  So if you're planting hemp on a property that's forested, well, let's say part of it is forested,
[01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:47.790]  and you're planting it on, who do you go to if you have a... I think if you have a theft issue
[01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:54.830]  and you're holding our Ag and Markets Research Authorization, you would go to your local law
[01:53:54.830 --> 01:54:00.270]  enforcement officials, but you would also want to be sure that we at the department knew what was
[01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:08.350]  going on as well. And do you get signage to put on the property? So the current regulation, and again,
[01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:15.630]  the current regulation that's on the books, we wrote those with the research institutions in mind.
[01:54:15.630 --> 01:54:20.270]  So frankly, they're a little bit outdated for where we are right now, as far as what's going
[01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:26.590]  on in the state. Those original regulations did have a specific signage requirement.
[01:54:26.590 --> 01:54:32.350]  And going forward, that's not going to be in the next iteration of the regulations,
[01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:40.190]  because you sort of have a double-edged sword with signage. If you put a no trespassing sign here,
[01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:46.750]  I'm not going to go in. But if my wife saw a no trespassing sign here, she would go in,
[01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:54.510]  because she'd want to see what was in there. We tested that years ago at the Washington State
[01:54:54.510 --> 01:55:00.190]  Governor's Mansion, and the troopers took us out of there. So we got three steps up the driveway.
[01:55:00.190 --> 01:55:06.430]  It's not like in Albany where there's a gate. Anyway, so signage is really going to depend
[01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:15.630]  upon your situation. Driving up and looking at this from the road, I could tell it was hemp from
[01:55:15.630 --> 01:55:20.430]  the road, but I was looking for hemp. If I was driving by here and had no idea that it was here,
[01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:27.390]  I would just think it was some different field crop. So a lot's going to depend upon your location.
[01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:32.190]  The signage, to a certain extent, one of our authorization holders said, hey,
[01:55:32.190 --> 01:55:37.790]  you're putting an advertisement on this. He wasn't concerned about the local kids going in
[01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:45.310]  the field and stealing it. He was concerned about somebody else within a five mile radius that was
[01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:52.510]  perhaps growing something else and didn't want the pollen from his crop to contaminate and elicit
[01:55:52.510 --> 01:56:02.670]  grow and having it be destroyed because of that. Yes. Is there any answer as to whether
[01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:12.190]  a farmer who's holding a federal program benefit like through FSA can grow under the New York
[01:56:12.190 --> 01:56:20.030]  permit? Excellent question. So the question was, can somebody who is participating in some of the
[01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:28.510]  of the other federal programs like Conservation Reserve or what have you, can they hold our permit
[01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:35.310]  and participate without putting into jeopardy their other payments? And so we've been going
[01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:41.150]  back and forth quite a bit with our legal counsel on that. And we don't necessarily have a clear
[01:56:41.150 --> 01:56:49.230]  answer on that. Our legal counsel at the department feels as though with our research authorization,
[01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:57.150]  there shouldn't be a problem. But that is not to say that somebody at the county level and an FSA
[01:56:57.150 --> 01:57:03.070]  or another federal office couldn't hold something up. So I think that's something we're still
[01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:10.830]  working on and trying to hammer that out. And perhaps that's something from a policy perspective
[01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:15.710]  that needs to be defined better in the farm bill. I do think the bill that was signed here back a
[01:57:15.710 --> 01:57:22.510]  few weeks ago at the state level reiterates the fact that this is an agricultural commodity. And
[01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:27.870]  I think that may help a little bit with this, but we're sort of on untested waters on that. But it's
[01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:32.350]  a great question and one that we've heard a number of times and are working on. So thank you.
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:43.620]  Yes, sir. I mentioned we've got what, 31 states now that are involved in research and production
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:52.100]  of some sort. Is there any group lobbying effort going on a federal level to
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:58:00.020]  look at legislation for the 2018 farm bill? I mean, our current attorney general is probably not
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:08.820]  hemp friendly. I think you mentioned one other workshop that he spells everything P-O-T.
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:09.880]  Soon.
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:16.420]  But I mean, moving forward, as these states develop this federal,
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:22.820]  I thought that was going to be one of the bookends you were talking about is a federal
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:23.380]  regulation.
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:32.740]  Yeah. I mean, that one is for sure is also in there. So I've been asked, actually was asked
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:40.740]  yesterday to be sure to write up my policy issues within plant industry for the 2018 farm bill. And
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:48.100]  was encouraged to have several that related to industrial hemp. So I think we'll come at it from
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:54.260]  that direction. I also think that the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:59.940]  will likely, and that's basically the commissioners and the state directors and
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:06.660]  those types of folks at the highest levels, will probably have something from a policy perspective.
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:13.380]  And then there's the Hemp Industries Association and some of the other like Vote Hemp,
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:19.380]  who I think will have some pressure from the producer and the general public side.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:24.420]  And Farm Bureau probably will as well. I don't know. Is that in their policy manual at this
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:24.980]  policy book?
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:25.780]  Yes, I got it put in there.
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:26.100]  All right.
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:31.540]  I got that time limit put in there too. We lobby in Albany and in Washington. And I make sure that
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:36.020]  I go because some of the older people still don't understand the difference between marijuana and
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:40.740]  hemp and still legislators, like when you said there are about five, when Donna was saying that,
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:44.180]  like there really weren't when I brought it up. People were not in the last three years
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:47.860]  understanding it. Now it's like they're like, oh yeah, I've heard about this. And we're going to
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:54.660]  keep going. And if you want to contact your county Farm Bureau and help support them and let them
[01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:58.180]  know that people are, farmers are interested in it. If they don't know farmers are interested in
[01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:02.180]  it, they're not going to want it. You know, we, Farm Bureau supports what farmers want. And if
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:05.300]  they're not feeling a need from farmers, then they're not going to want to support it. You
[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:09.780]  know, then I'm just the crazy hemp lady. So no, not at all.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.620]  Chris, I had a question. We heard a lot about
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:17.380]  seed protection and cloning protection, but what about it's a perennial plant?
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:22.980]  So how are we protecting it from growing back perennially?
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:28.020]  Like if a farmer cuts it down, say with a sift and leaves the roots in the ground,
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:32.820]  there's a good chance it's going to come back on its own. Or if they let it go to seed and they
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:36.020]  don't collect all those seeds before they hit the ground, there's a good chance it's just going to
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:40.740]  seed itself. So how, how are we talking about protection on that? And like with apples or
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:46.500]  other farm bodies, is there like a statute of limitations, like an apple that is crossbred,
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:52.500]  they have a new snapdragon one. I can plant it, but I can't sell it for 10 years. And then I will
[02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:57.220]  be able to sell it as whatever. Are there, are there things like that for this perennial growth?
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:02.100]  So I don't think we've really addressed that at this point in time. And perhaps that's something,
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:07.300]  you know, I know that's an issue because what I've learned is when it goes through the combine,
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:13.140]  it does shatter. And so you do have a lot of reseeding during, just during the harvesting
[02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:18.900]  process. So that is probably something that we've got to address at some point going forward. Yep.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:28.780]  Yes. Is there any interest in, in developing a market for the herd and putting that back in the
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:32.700]  ground and getting carbon credits? I know there's a lot of activity in India and in
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:39.100]  Europe. There's a whole market. So we actually have an authorization holder or current authorization
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:44.940]  holder that has a piece of that in their research plan to be looking at that a little bit. And I
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:53.660]  think, I think Dr. Vyans was talking a little bit about the systematics person looking at how it
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:02:00.940]  fits into a rotation. And so there may be some, you know, really good agronomic and carbon credit
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:07.180]  issues, you know, that are benefits in a rotation, even if you weren't going to the extent of
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:15.560]  growing it for grain or some other purpose. Is there, is there going to be a cap on how many
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:24.520]  research license holders are going to be available for next year? So the cap was removed from the law.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:32.040]  So what I would say to you is, you know, we're still going to require an application. We're
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:37.320]  still going to require the application fee. It's $500 for three years. And we're still going to,
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:43.800]  as long as the farm bill's in place and says it's a research pilot program, we're still going to be
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:51.640]  evaluating proposals and, you know, making sure that the projects that we, that we give the
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:57.000]  authorizations to, you know, have a research outcome associated with them. But we don't anticipate
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:04.520]  a limited number. Now, you know, the other piece of it, I also need to be protective of the fact
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:12.280]  that there are many important missions that my division is responsible for in New York State.
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:20.600]  And I have a limited number of people out there to do this work. And so we have export certification
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:26.680]  and interstate certification of many agricultural products that are very lucrative for the state of
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:32.920]  New York for our farmers. We need to make sure we fulfill that. We have plant pest and survey
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:39.480]  responsibilities for invasive insects and diseases that would, you know, cause damage to the
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:44.600]  agriculture of New York as well as the environment. We have to take that very, very seriously.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.800]  So I guess where I'm going is, is if I got 10,000 applications, I probably can't
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:58.840]  give out 10,000 authorizations. But what we're hoping to do is create an environment where we're
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:04.600]  learning as much as we can going forward for the time when maybe the Industrial Hemp Farming Act
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:12.520]  sails through. And if it's no longer a regulated substance, then our role is diminished a great
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:17.640]  deal, I would say, from a regulatory perspective. The other part that I'll just throw out there is,
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:24.840]  is I think anybody who's involved in this for the time being, with it being federally regulated as
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:30.200]  well as regulated at the state level, you have to understand what it is that you're growing. You
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:37.480]  need to know your seed source. You need to know that it does meet the 0.3% THC. And you need to
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:44.920]  do everything, you know, in your power to protect yourself as well as protect all the great work
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:51.080]  that's been done to bring this from something that everybody was scared to death of two years ago,
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:56.440]  to something where there's, you know, 50 or 100 people under a tent at Ithaca talking about it.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:02.280]  So, Donna, you want to make a comment on that? I know we're running long, but I just want to
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:06.920]  make a couple of quick summary comments. First, I want to thank Cornell for putting this together.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:11.640]  This is really informative. I just wanted you to know that you feel really good about being in New
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:15.560]  York State right now around this. Compared to other states who may be permitting this,
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:21.640]  you know, all of the gears are in motion. As hard as it is to believe, I have to pinch myself.
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:26.600]  The governor just put $10 million down on the table for processor grants of $250,000.
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:34.280]  And we have a one-stop shop and a helpline and many, many folks, good folks like Chris
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:39.720]  Lewis and others in AgriMarkets who are very committed to this. What I'm hoping to see happen,
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:45.240]  that's what I wanted to leave you with from my end, is we're hoping that hubs will be developing.
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:49.400]  We're seeing a food and beverage hub starting to develop in central New York. We're seeing a
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:54.520]  CBD pharmaceutical hub starting to develop in the southern tier. Hudson Valley is also doing
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:06:01.640]  some food and beverage and some CBD. It would be helpful if the Farm Bureau and farm collectives
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:05.160]  could get more organized so that we're not sort of tripping over each other,
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:11.560]  that you've got 10 farms all growing the same thing with a partner processor with a market in
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:17.720]  mind so we're not sort of in the Wild West here. The governor has directed all of Empire State
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:24.040]  Development, all the regional economic development councils to prioritize this. So in central New York,
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:28.760]  Finger Lakes and southern tier where there's a lot of money from the upstate revitalization
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:33.960]  initiative, they're looking for projects and they want to be able to provide some funding to help
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:38.840]  this. So we're lucky in this regard. So thank you, thank you everybody for going along with this.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:47.000]  Do you make a list of the farmers available to people who want to process so that we know where
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:53.000]  to go get material? So we have not done that at this point in time and so we're working through
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:07:01.640]  some foil issues on that and just trying to understand exactly what we can and can't release.
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:06.440]  And so we probably will have the answers to those questions in the next couple of weeks because
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:14.520]  we've been asked. But there's, I mean if processors are really interested, Extension puts out
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:20.120]  newsletters to all farmers, put in ad newsletters that you're looking for feed or you're looking for
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:27.160]  fiber, what you're looking for, and they'll come to you. And then no foil needed. Right.
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:32.520]  So if you were to get a farmer to give you seed, it has to be sterilized at the farmer level or are
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:40.440]  you allowed to sterilize? So as a processor you could sterilize it but the other thing is is that
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:46.120]  from what I've been told by some of the authorization holders is one of the things
[02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:52.200]  that they want is to be able to use the unsterilized seed in some products and that
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:57.400]  there are some attributes of the seed, you know, before it's roasted or before it's denatured in
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:03.720]  some other way that are beneficial. And so what I would say as long as it's not moving beyond the
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:10.040]  borders of the state where we can't really have any real impact on, you know, changing that policy
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:16.040]  today, you know, work with us to figure out how to get it to where it needs to go.
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:28.680]  Yes sir. To clarify while we navigate the gray area, can you get an application to grow for CBD
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:36.760]  only in New York State right now? Submit one. Okay and as far as the processes go, are extractions
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:44.120]  part of that dialogue? Absolutely. So what's going to happen on CBD, a little bit more detail
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:48.840]  on that, I guess I glossed over it a little bit. So a little bit more detail on that is that the
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:57.480]  Department of Health has asked us to put several CBD related questions on the application so that
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:05.640]  we can flag projects that need to have somebody with a health, nutritional, or medical background
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:13.720]  help us to review. And so those are probably going to go into a separate pile and we will
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:19.160]  have a group of folks from our department as well as from Department of Health who will be looking
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:24.600]  at those and trying to navigate those through the system and understand exactly what it is that
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:30.200]  you're wanting to do. And what we're contemplating, and again this is early on and it's an important
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:37.080]  detail that you ask about, we'll probably, we have what's called a research partner agreement.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:44.040]  So the way the process works right now is you submit an application, we act upon it, we say we
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:51.480]  like your project. And then the next step is we send you our research partner agreement, which
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:57.480]  is basically outlining what your responsibilities as our research partner with the State Department
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:03.160]  of Agriculture, what your responsibilities are, what our responsibilities are. And so in that
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:09.640]  agreement on the CBD end of things, there probably will be some specific clauses that are inserted in
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:17.480]  there that are again trying to build you a safe harbor within what we currently know about CBD.
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:22.840]  And it's, every state is struggling with the CBD thing because there's a lack of clarity.
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:29.320]  I can tell you one more thing that out in Oregon we struggle with. That Oregon had a thousand
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:34.760]  acres planted last year and had three thousand acres planted this year. Much of it's for CBD.
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:41.400]  There is not enough of an infrastructure to do anything with this material. There's so
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:47.560]  limited on extractive facilities, food grade approved facilities, you get all this
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.240]  flour and it's going out of state to get extracted because it has to.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:57.720]  Yeah, and there's definitely some challenges with that. We were in a processing plant in Kentucky,
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:04.680]  one part of it was for food grade work, the other part was fiber and structural materials.
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:11.960]  And I think they said that's one of the biggest plants in the country and it wasn't very big.
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:16.360]  So, you know, that's as I said, you know, the bookends, the seed and the processing,
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:19.400]  the processing piece is vitally important going forward.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:29.640]  Dave. Several people have mentioned grower co-ops and collectives and things like that
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:35.320]  and Cornell does have a resource in Bobby Severson and the Dyson School that provides
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:42.040]  guidance in terms of co-op formation. So there is that resource if you would like to pursue it.
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:50.280]  Thank you. That's very helpful. So, Chris, maybe we should wrap up and let folks talk
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:53.880]  to everyone individually and walk around the plots a bit. Sounds great. Thank you.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:57.000]  I'm going to get some water.
