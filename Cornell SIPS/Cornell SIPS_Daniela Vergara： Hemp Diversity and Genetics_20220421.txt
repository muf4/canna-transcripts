[00:00.120 --> 00:04.280]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.280 --> 00:11.230]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:11.230 --> 00:13.510]  My name is Tony Bracco and I work
[00:13.510 --> 00:15.390]  alongside Dr. Zachary Stansel,
[00:15.390 --> 00:17.950]  who's the USDA hemp germplasm curator.
[00:17.950 --> 00:19.710]  And I wanted to tell you a little bit about
[00:19.710 --> 00:21.150]  our work and why we wanted to host
[00:21.150 --> 00:23.350]  this hemp webinar series.
[00:23.350 --> 00:25.030]  And so my team and I run
[00:25.030 --> 00:26.790]  the hemp germplasm repository,
[00:26.790 --> 00:28.350]  which is similar to a library,
[00:28.350 --> 00:29.430]  but for seeds.
[00:29.430 --> 00:31.390]  And the first goal of our work is to help
[00:31.390 --> 00:33.590]  protect the genetic diversity of
[00:33.590 --> 00:35.630]  hemp and our second goal is to make
[00:35.630 --> 00:36.590]  a lot of different types of
[00:36.590 --> 00:38.310]  hemp available for science.
[00:38.310 --> 00:39.710]  And so these seeds can be
[00:39.710 --> 00:41.310]  requested by plant scientists,
[00:41.310 --> 00:43.150]  plant breeders, and educators.
[00:43.150 --> 00:44.950]  And we believe that these seeds can be
[00:44.950 --> 00:47.230]  useful to answer all sorts of questions.
[00:47.230 --> 00:48.830]  And we hope that this work allows
[00:48.830 --> 00:50.910]  universities, companies, farmers,
[00:50.910 --> 00:52.430]  and everyone else to benefit from
[00:52.430 --> 00:55.190]  a thousand percent potential uses of hemp.
[00:55.190 --> 00:57.310]  During this work, we've met so many
[00:57.310 --> 00:58.830]  interesting and dynamic people
[00:58.830 --> 00:59.870]  across the world of hemp that
[00:59.870 --> 01:01.390]  we wanted to present them to you.
[01:01.390 --> 01:03.030]  So we teamed up with our friends at
[01:03.030 --> 01:04.230]  Cornell University to
[01:04.230 --> 01:05.550]  present them to you today.
[01:05.550 --> 01:07.950]  So I want to give a huge thanks to George
[01:07.950 --> 01:10.830]  Sack, Gemma Osborne, and Ken Paul.
[01:10.830 --> 01:12.830]  But most of all, I'm thrilled
[01:12.830 --> 01:14.350]  to present our speaker today,
[01:14.350 --> 01:16.150]  Dr. Daniela Vergara.
[01:16.150 --> 01:18.030]  Dr. Daniela Vergara is
[01:18.030 --> 01:19.790]  an evolutionary biologist,
[01:19.790 --> 01:21.590]  data analyst, educator,
[01:21.590 --> 01:23.990]  scientific writer, and public speaker.
[01:23.990 --> 01:26.350]  In addition to her multiple publications,
[01:26.350 --> 01:27.750]  she founded and directs
[01:27.750 --> 01:29.430]  a non-profit organization,
[01:29.430 --> 01:32.070]  the Agricultural Genomics Foundation,
[01:32.070 --> 01:33.830]  which aims to make hemp and
[01:33.830 --> 01:36.550]  cannabinoid science available to a broad public.
[01:36.550 --> 01:38.430]  Dr. Vergara has been part of
[01:38.430 --> 01:40.430]  scientific teams at private companies,
[01:40.430 --> 01:42.670]  including Steep Hill and
[01:42.670 --> 01:44.030]  a biotech company called
[01:44.030 --> 01:45.950]  Front Range Biosciences.
[01:45.950 --> 01:48.790]  Through AGF, Dr. Vergara
[01:48.790 --> 01:50.750]  educates the public about science,
[01:50.750 --> 01:52.630]  data analysis, statistics,
[01:52.630 --> 01:55.070]  evolutionary biology, and genomics.
[01:55.070 --> 01:56.470]  Dr. Vergara is also
[01:56.470 --> 01:59.310]  an international consultant and policy advisor,
[01:59.310 --> 02:00.670]  and has advised companies in
[02:00.670 --> 02:02.590]  the US and Latin America.
[02:02.590 --> 02:04.310]  Additionally, she has worked as
[02:04.310 --> 02:05.510]  an expert witness for
[02:05.510 --> 02:08.230]  multiple legal cases in the US and abroad.
[02:08.230 --> 02:10.590]  Dr. Vergara is a scientific writer in
[02:10.590 --> 02:12.110]  both Spanish and English,
[02:12.110 --> 02:14.150]  and has translated her scientific work in
[02:14.150 --> 02:17.710]  Spanish for a broad public in Hispanic countries.
[02:17.710 --> 02:20.630]  Before we begin, I ask that as you think of
[02:20.630 --> 02:22.430]  questions for Dr. Vergara
[02:22.430 --> 02:23.830]  throughout the presentation,
[02:23.830 --> 02:25.910]  please put them in the Q&A tab,
[02:25.910 --> 02:27.910]  and anything written in the chat tab
[02:27.910 --> 02:30.550]  will not be looked at in the Q&A at the end.
[02:30.670 --> 02:31.910]  Please put your questions in
[02:31.910 --> 02:33.590]  throughout the presentation.
[02:33.590 --> 02:35.710]  And without further ado,
[02:35.710 --> 02:39.750]  present, take us away, Dr. Vergara.
[02:39.750 --> 02:42.190]  Thank you very, very much, Tony,
[02:42.190 --> 02:43.950]  for the very nice presentation.
[02:43.950 --> 02:45.830]  And thank you for the organizers.
[02:45.830 --> 02:48.710]  I am going to, so thank you very much.
[02:48.710 --> 02:50.230]  I am Daniela Vergara,
[02:50.230 --> 02:54.710]  I'm the Emerging Crops Specialist at Cornell.
[02:54.710 --> 02:59.070]  So this is my email,
[02:59.070 --> 03:01.950]  my website, my Twitter,
[03:01.950 --> 03:04.310]  if you want to contact me.
[03:04.310 --> 03:07.790]  So as Tony was saying,
[03:07.790 --> 03:10.830]  I was part of the University of Colorado Boulder.
[03:10.830 --> 03:12.470]  I still am a lecturer there.
[03:12.470 --> 03:15.950]  I teach a class for the broad public
[03:15.950 --> 03:18.110]  for it through continuing education,
[03:18.110 --> 03:20.230]  if anyone wants to take it.
[03:20.230 --> 03:21.870]  I am the co-founder of
[03:21.870 --> 03:23.710]  the Cannabis Genomic Research Initiative,
[03:23.710 --> 03:25.790]  which is our group at CU Boulder
[03:25.790 --> 03:28.150]  that aims to study the cannabis genome.
[03:28.230 --> 03:31.270]  And I co-founded the Agricultural Genomics Foundation,
[03:31.270 --> 03:33.030]  which is a nonprofit organization
[03:33.030 --> 03:34.470]  that I currently direct
[03:34.470 --> 03:36.150]  that aims on bringing science,
[03:36.150 --> 03:38.230]  cannabis science to a broad public.
[03:38.230 --> 03:39.750]  And right now I'm part of
[03:39.750 --> 03:42.230]  the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[03:43.390 --> 03:48.230]  So if you looked at the schedule today for 20, lucky me,
[03:48.230 --> 03:49.910]  I was scheduled to give a talk
[03:49.910 --> 03:52.230]  on hemp diversity and genetics.
[03:52.230 --> 03:54.990]  And due to my background,
[03:54.990 --> 03:57.350]  the first thing that I thought was to talk about
[03:57.350 --> 03:58.750]  the cannabis genotype.
[03:59.990 --> 04:03.470]  However, today is the birthday of this paper
[04:03.470 --> 04:05.350]  that got published last year.
[04:05.350 --> 04:08.430]  So it's one year since I published this paper.
[04:08.430 --> 04:10.510]  So I wanted to talk about this paper
[04:10.510 --> 04:12.470]  that deals with the phenotype.
[04:13.950 --> 04:17.630]  But the talk was on hemp diversity and genetics.
[04:17.630 --> 04:19.910]  So I needed to talk about the genotype,
[04:19.910 --> 04:21.030]  but in my opinion,
[04:21.030 --> 04:23.310]  one of the reasons why we study the genome,
[04:23.310 --> 04:25.510]  which is the whole conglomerate of DNA,
[04:25.550 --> 04:29.350]  all of the collections of letters in a genome, right?
[04:29.350 --> 04:30.670]  Each of us has a genome.
[04:30.670 --> 04:32.190]  Cannabis also has a genome.
[04:32.190 --> 04:33.990]  Each plant has a genome.
[04:33.990 --> 04:36.310]  So I wanted to talk about the genotype.
[04:36.310 --> 04:38.270]  And one of the reasons we study the genome
[04:38.270 --> 04:40.870]  is to relate it to the phenotype.
[04:40.870 --> 04:42.910]  So today I'm gonna be talking
[04:42.910 --> 04:45.830]  about the cannabis genotype and phenotype.
[04:47.070 --> 04:48.390]  And I wanna let you know
[04:48.390 --> 04:51.230]  that my talk is gonna be a little graph heavy,
[04:51.270 --> 04:55.670]  but I'm gonna try my best to explain each of the graphs.
[04:55.670 --> 04:58.030]  And I wanna start with acknowledging
[04:58.030 --> 05:00.990]  all of my collaborators from all over the place,
[05:00.990 --> 05:03.470]  Leafly, the Agricultural Genomics Foundation,
[05:03.470 --> 05:06.350]  CSU Pueblo, CU Boulder, of course,
[05:06.350 --> 05:08.990]  which is the place where I produced all of the data
[05:08.990 --> 05:11.110]  that I'm gonna show you today.
[05:11.110 --> 05:13.390]  And of course, Front Range Biosciences,
[05:13.390 --> 05:16.950]  where I worked for two years.
[05:16.950 --> 05:20.510]  And my talk is gonna have three different parts.
[05:20.510 --> 05:22.470]  I'm gonna talk about the cannabis genome,
[05:22.470 --> 05:25.830]  the cannabinoid genes, the terpene genes,
[05:25.830 --> 05:30.110]  and how each of these relates to the phenotype.
[05:32.870 --> 05:35.270]  And I'm gonna start with a take-home message.
[05:35.270 --> 05:36.950]  When in the industry,
[05:36.950 --> 05:41.230]  they tell you about sativa and indica, be skeptical.
[05:42.230 --> 05:44.910]  So I'm gonna start with the cannabis genome.
[05:44.910 --> 05:46.990]  So cannabis is an angiosperm plant.
[05:46.990 --> 05:49.030]  So it's a plant that produces flowers.
[05:49.030 --> 05:52.030]  It is part of the family Cannabiasia.
[05:52.030 --> 05:57.030]  Cannabis sativa L was described by Linnaeus in 1753.
[05:58.510 --> 05:59.830]  Cannabis is dioecious.
[05:59.830 --> 06:02.390]  So males and females are in different plants,
[06:02.390 --> 06:03.470]  kind of like us, right?
[06:03.470 --> 06:06.350]  We have males and females in different individuals.
[06:06.350 --> 06:09.750]  Males have an X and a Y chromosome like us,
[06:09.750 --> 06:13.310]  and females an X and X chromosome, two X chromosomes.
[06:13.310 --> 06:15.390]  There's also monoecious individuals.
[06:15.430 --> 06:19.070]  So monoecious individuals produce both males
[06:19.070 --> 06:20.750]  and female flowers,
[06:20.750 --> 06:23.630]  and they have undifferentiated chromosomes,
[06:23.630 --> 06:26.430]  which means that they're not like the X and the Y,
[06:26.430 --> 06:28.230]  but the chromosomes themselves
[06:28.230 --> 06:29.990]  are not different from each other.
[06:29.990 --> 06:34.350]  And apparently in this monoecious individuals,
[06:34.350 --> 06:37.630]  part of the chromosome is similar to the female chromosome,
[06:37.630 --> 06:40.270]  at least a part of the chromosome is.
[06:40.270 --> 06:42.310]  And cannabis is diploid, right?
[06:42.310 --> 06:45.230]  So it inherits like us.
[06:46.070 --> 06:49.030]  So it's one set of chromosomes from mom
[06:49.030 --> 06:50.950]  and one from dad, right?
[06:50.950 --> 06:53.710]  So part of the chromosomes come from dad,
[06:53.710 --> 06:56.350]  half of the chromosomes from dad and half from mom.
[06:57.510 --> 06:59.910]  The genome size in cannabis females
[06:59.910 --> 07:03.830]  have approximately 818 megabase pairs.
[07:03.830 --> 07:08.510]  So 818 million letters in the genome.
[07:08.510 --> 07:11.590]  The males have 843 million letters.
[07:11.630 --> 07:13.150]  The Y chromosome of the males
[07:13.150 --> 07:15.750]  is larger than that of the females
[07:15.750 --> 07:18.270]  because the Y chromosome is larger.
[07:18.270 --> 07:21.270]  And in fact, the Y chromosome in cannabis
[07:21.270 --> 07:24.150]  is the largest of all of the genome.
[07:24.150 --> 07:26.790]  And again, it has 10 chromosomes,
[07:26.790 --> 07:28.110]  nine of them autosomes.
[07:28.110 --> 07:32.350]  So nine of them are not related to sex chromosomes,
[07:32.350 --> 07:34.270]  and then it has an X and a Y.
[07:35.710 --> 07:38.110]  So when we sequence a genome,
[07:38.110 --> 07:41.190]  all of the letters of the genome, of the DNA,
[07:41.190 --> 07:42.750]  and we transcribe them,
[07:42.750 --> 07:45.470]  we have to break them up into little pieces.
[07:46.470 --> 07:49.070]  And then we have to put them back together
[07:49.070 --> 07:50.910]  bioinformatically,
[07:50.910 --> 07:53.550]  kind of like putting together a puzzle, right?
[07:53.550 --> 07:56.190]  So ideally, when we have something
[07:56.190 --> 07:58.510]  that is called a genome assembly,
[07:58.510 --> 08:02.070]  we would have nine autosomes,
[08:02.070 --> 08:04.110]  so nine chromosomes, nine pieces
[08:04.110 --> 08:06.590]  that are not related to the sex chromosomes,
[08:06.590 --> 08:07.950]  and then the sex chromosome.
[08:08.790 --> 08:11.030]  So in total, we would like 11 total pieces
[08:11.030 --> 08:12.830]  with the X and the Y, right?
[08:12.830 --> 08:15.550]  Nine autosomes plus X and Y
[08:15.550 --> 08:19.070]  with the 843 million base pairs.
[08:20.270 --> 08:22.590]  And indeed, right now,
[08:22.590 --> 08:26.430]  that is where we are, more or less.
[08:26.430 --> 08:30.150]  Thanks to Grassan collaborators from 2018
[08:30.150 --> 08:31.150]  in their preprint,
[08:31.150 --> 08:34.350]  and then later in 2021,
[08:34.350 --> 08:37.430]  we definitely have nine autosomes.
[08:37.430 --> 08:40.710]  So we have nine chunks of DNA,
[08:40.710 --> 08:42.950]  and we have one sex chromosome.
[08:42.950 --> 08:45.870]  We are still lacking the Y chromosome,
[08:46.950 --> 08:49.510]  but we still have 200 pieces
[08:49.510 --> 08:52.270]  that we don't know where they go, right?
[08:52.270 --> 08:56.030]  So we're very close of having a very good assembly,
[08:56.030 --> 08:58.710]  and Grassan's assembly is a very good assembly.
[08:59.790 --> 09:01.150]  And this is how it looks like.
[09:01.150 --> 09:03.790]  We have chromosome one, two, three, four,
[09:03.790 --> 09:05.710]  five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[09:05.710 --> 09:07.310]  and the X chromosome, right?
[09:08.190 --> 09:10.070]  We're still lacking the Y chromosome.
[09:12.190 --> 09:15.550]  And we not only have one assembly, right?
[09:15.550 --> 09:17.350]  We have multiple assemblies.
[09:17.350 --> 09:18.350]  I think that right now,
[09:18.350 --> 09:20.990]  we have between 13 to 15 assemblies
[09:20.990 --> 09:23.070]  that are publicly available.
[09:23.070 --> 09:27.750]  Here in this slide, I'm showing nine of them, right?
[09:27.750 --> 09:29.390]  So nine individuals, right?
[09:29.390 --> 09:30.710]  Nine, nine individuals.
[09:30.710 --> 09:32.870]  So we have an individual purple cush,
[09:32.870 --> 09:34.670]  finola, Jamaican lion,
[09:34.670 --> 09:36.670]  pineapple, banana, baba cush,
[09:36.990 --> 09:38.830]  and this is the one that Grassa assembled,
[09:38.830 --> 09:40.990]  the one that I was just talking about,
[09:40.990 --> 09:44.950]  canna tonic, carmagnola, USO 31 from CSU Pueblo.
[09:44.950 --> 09:47.670]  I'm not sure if they're already publicly available,
[09:47.670 --> 09:49.390]  but I'm sure they will be soon.
[09:49.390 --> 09:54.150]  And this supposedly wild assembly
[09:54.150 --> 09:55.830]  that is also in very good state.
[09:55.830 --> 09:59.590]  So I think that this two, CS10 and the wild one,
[09:59.590 --> 10:01.470]  we don't really know if there's wild cannabis.
[10:01.470 --> 10:04.190]  That's why it's wild, but that's what they say.
[10:05.190 --> 10:08.630]  These two are the ones that are in the best shape.
[10:08.630 --> 10:13.350]  So here I am showing nine of the 13 or 15 assemblies
[10:13.350 --> 10:15.030]  that we have available.
[10:17.110 --> 10:19.030]  So when we look at the relationship
[10:19.030 --> 10:22.350]  between cannabis varieties, cannabis strains,
[10:23.910 --> 10:26.510]  we see something like this.
[10:26.510 --> 10:29.750]  This is called a split tree graph.
[10:29.750 --> 10:32.910]  Each of these lines is a strain.
[10:33.230 --> 10:35.870]  The closer you are in this graph,
[10:35.870 --> 10:37.670]  the more of the genome you share.
[10:37.670 --> 10:39.710]  So if my son and I were in this graph,
[10:39.710 --> 10:41.510]  we would be very close to each other
[10:41.510 --> 10:44.070]  because we share a lot of our genome.
[10:44.070 --> 10:45.510]  So each of these line is a strain.
[10:45.510 --> 10:46.950]  I'm showing here the relationship
[10:46.950 --> 10:50.190]  between approximately 300 different varieties,
[10:50.190 --> 10:52.470]  300 different strains.
[10:52.470 --> 10:54.910]  This thread-like structure in the middle
[10:54.910 --> 10:58.230]  is the part of the genome that everyone shares.
[10:58.230 --> 11:01.190]  So it's the part of the ancestral part of the genome.
[11:01.310 --> 11:04.270]  And depending on how you divide this graph,
[11:04.270 --> 11:06.590]  you more or less see these three groups.
[11:06.590 --> 11:08.710]  This is how we divided this graph.
[11:08.710 --> 11:11.990]  And we can see here the broadleaf marijuana types,
[11:11.990 --> 11:14.510]  the narrowleaf marijuana types, and the hemps.
[11:15.830 --> 11:17.190]  The broadleaves and the narrowleaves,
[11:17.190 --> 11:19.830]  the broadleaves in purple, the narrowleaves in blue,
[11:19.830 --> 11:23.270]  these two are using medical and recreational settings
[11:23.270 --> 11:26.430]  while the hemps are used in industrial settings.
[11:26.430 --> 11:28.630]  And I wanna clarify something.
[11:28.630 --> 11:30.590]  These hemps for industrial settings,
[11:30.590 --> 11:32.270]  this group that we see here,
[11:32.270 --> 11:36.150]  are the ones that are used for fiber or for oil.
[11:37.070 --> 11:40.830]  So these guys over here are not necessarily the ones
[11:40.830 --> 11:45.150]  that have, I mean, usually they have less than 0.3% THC,
[11:45.150 --> 11:49.070]  but the government coined this same hemp
[11:49.070 --> 11:52.790]  for anything that has less than 0.3% THC.
[11:52.790 --> 11:54.270]  And there are some individuals
[11:54.270 --> 11:55.910]  that are not necessarily hemp,
[11:55.950 --> 11:58.430]  that are actually low THC marijuana,
[11:58.430 --> 12:02.670]  individuals that even though they have less than 0.3% THC,
[12:02.670 --> 12:06.910]  they fall in these categories over here in this graph
[12:06.910 --> 12:08.430]  when we look at the genome.
[12:09.790 --> 12:13.070]  Now, when we look at these nine assemblies
[12:13.070 --> 12:14.710]  that I just showed you,
[12:14.710 --> 12:18.310]  these assemblies also fall into some of these groupings.
[12:18.310 --> 12:20.510]  So we have, for example, purple cush
[12:20.510 --> 12:22.910]  and pineapple, banana, baba cush
[12:22.910 --> 12:24.790]  that are part of the broadleaf.
[12:24.830 --> 12:27.550]  Pinola, carmagnola and USO 31
[12:27.550 --> 12:29.270]  that are part of the hemps.
[12:29.270 --> 12:31.030]  Jamaican lion and canna tonic
[12:31.030 --> 12:32.670]  that are part of the narrow leaves.
[12:32.670 --> 12:33.870]  And then we have these two,
[12:33.870 --> 12:37.510]  CSN and the wild one that are hybrids.
[12:37.510 --> 12:42.510]  CSN indeed is a hybrid between a hemp and a marijuana type.
[12:45.790 --> 12:47.950]  And pinola and purple cush,
[12:47.950 --> 12:50.590]  I wanna say these were the first two assemblies
[12:50.590 --> 12:51.870]  that we had available.
[12:51.910 --> 12:54.710]  They were published in 2011 by a group,
[12:54.710 --> 12:57.190]  a Canadian group led by Jonathan Page.
[12:58.110 --> 13:02.070]  And then in 2019, they improved these assemblies as well.
[13:03.910 --> 13:06.470]  When we look at the variation in the nuclear genome
[13:06.470 --> 13:09.190]  and these are preliminary results,
[13:09.190 --> 13:11.870]  we have in this graph, we have our three groups,
[13:11.870 --> 13:14.590]  the broadleaves, the hemps, the narrow leaves.
[13:14.590 --> 13:18.310]  And we have in the Y-axis, which is our vertical axis,
[13:18.310 --> 13:19.870]  we have diversity.
[13:19.910 --> 13:22.030]  When we look at the diversity in cannabis,
[13:22.030 --> 13:25.110]  we more or less see that it has approximately
[13:25.110 --> 13:28.510]  2 to 3% nucleotide diversity.
[13:28.510 --> 13:32.310]  This is a measurement of genomic diversity.
[13:32.310 --> 13:35.070]  And this doesn't mean much,
[13:35.070 --> 13:37.990]  but when we compare it to other species
[13:37.990 --> 13:42.990]  like bonobos, chimpanzees, humans, domesticated corn,
[13:42.990 --> 13:44.790]  we can see that all of these species
[13:44.790 --> 13:47.310]  have less than 1% diversity.
[13:47.350 --> 13:52.350]  So cannabis has approximately 2 to 3% more diversity
[13:52.350 --> 13:53.950]  than any of these species.
[13:55.270 --> 13:58.670]  And we can see that as well in the phenotype.
[13:58.670 --> 14:01.070]  These are leaves from different strains,
[14:01.070 --> 14:02.750]  from different varieties.
[14:02.750 --> 14:04.830]  And we can see that the color varies,
[14:04.830 --> 14:08.310]  the number of leaflets varies, the size varies,
[14:08.310 --> 14:10.910]  and the leaves, all of these leaves
[14:10.910 --> 14:12.270]  are very different from each other,
[14:12.270 --> 14:15.390]  but the plants themselves are also very different.
[14:15.430 --> 14:18.550]  The height, the colors, the branching,
[14:18.550 --> 14:21.590]  and of course, the variety of compounds
[14:21.590 --> 14:23.190]  that cannabis produces.
[14:23.190 --> 14:25.270]  Cannabinoids, depending on how you count them,
[14:25.270 --> 14:27.710]  can be around the hundreds,
[14:27.710 --> 14:30.390]  also terpenes and flavonoids.
[14:30.390 --> 14:32.310]  There's a bunch of different compounds.
[14:32.310 --> 14:35.510]  And of course, the plant can be used for multiple purposes.
[14:36.950 --> 14:39.870]  The fiber can be used for rope, for paper,
[14:39.870 --> 14:42.910]  the oil can be used in personal products,
[14:42.910 --> 14:46.710]  hemp seeds are edible, it can be used for biofuel,
[14:46.710 --> 14:49.910]  for clothing, and of course, for medicine.
[14:51.670 --> 14:54.630]  In the industry, we're used to see these two names,
[14:54.630 --> 14:56.470]  indica and sativa.
[14:56.470 --> 15:01.470]  And then you have the indicas are supposed to have
[15:01.510 --> 15:06.510]  dense buds, and the plants are short,
[15:06.590 --> 15:08.230]  and the leaves are bushy,
[15:08.230 --> 15:10.110]  and then the sativas are tall,
[15:10.550 --> 15:11.630]  and the leaves are thin.
[15:11.630 --> 15:16.630]  But when we look at leaf shape,
[15:16.670 --> 15:19.790]  I'm gonna be showing this type of graphs
[15:19.790 --> 15:21.470]  several times throughout the talks.
[15:21.470 --> 15:24.870]  These are called principal component analysis graphs,
[15:24.870 --> 15:27.950]  and these are a dimensionality reduction graph.
[15:27.950 --> 15:30.590]  So we're basically taking a bunch of variation
[15:30.590 --> 15:33.230]  and showing it in two dimensions.
[15:33.230 --> 15:36.270]  Principal component one in the horizontal axis,
[15:36.270 --> 15:39.630]  the x-axis, and principal component one in the vertical,
[15:40.030 --> 15:43.190]  principal component two in the vertical, the y-axis.
[15:44.350 --> 15:47.510]  And in this case, we are showing the variation
[15:47.510 --> 15:49.070]  in leaf shape.
[15:49.070 --> 15:51.950]  Okay, so we have different points in these leaves,
[15:51.950 --> 15:53.710]  these points are called landmarks,
[15:53.710 --> 15:55.670]  we have different dots in these leaves.
[15:55.670 --> 15:58.310]  And if you are in this side of the graph,
[15:58.310 --> 16:02.110]  you have a squat leaf, and your leaflets are pointing out.
[16:03.030 --> 16:04.670]  If you're in this side of the graph,
[16:04.670 --> 16:06.910]  you have more of an elongated leaf,
[16:06.910 --> 16:09.590]  and your leaflets are pointing in.
[16:10.550 --> 16:11.910]  And between these two principal components
[16:11.910 --> 16:15.190]  of all of the variation, right, between these two,
[16:15.190 --> 16:18.910]  we're showing more, we're explaining more than 80%
[16:18.910 --> 16:21.270]  of the variation, which is pretty high.
[16:23.150 --> 16:27.790]  Females here are the circles, males are the squares.
[16:27.790 --> 16:32.310]  And if we had differences between sexes in leaf shape,
[16:32.310 --> 16:34.510]  we would expect, for example,
[16:34.510 --> 16:36.990]  that the males are in this side of the graph
[16:36.990 --> 16:38.630]  and they have a squat leaf,
[16:38.630 --> 16:40.990]  and the females are in this other side of the graph
[16:40.990 --> 16:43.150]  and they have an elongated leaf.
[16:43.150 --> 16:44.990]  Or perhaps the other way around,
[16:44.990 --> 16:47.830]  where the females are in this side of the graph
[16:47.830 --> 16:49.310]  and have a squat leaf,
[16:49.310 --> 16:51.270]  and the males in this other side of the graph
[16:51.270 --> 16:52.670]  with an elongated leaf.
[16:53.630 --> 16:58.190]  But what we see is that there's no correlation whatsoever
[16:58.190 --> 17:01.910]  between females and males and the leaf shape.
[17:01.910 --> 17:04.150]  So you can be a male and have a squat leaf,
[17:04.150 --> 17:06.470]  or you can be a female and have a squat leaf
[17:06.470 --> 17:08.990]  that has no relationship whatsoever
[17:08.990 --> 17:11.430]  between sex and leaf shape.
[17:13.830 --> 17:16.190]  And in fact, we see that leaf shape
[17:16.190 --> 17:18.470]  has no relationship with height,
[17:18.470 --> 17:20.510]  no relationship with branches,
[17:20.510 --> 17:23.590]  and no relationship with a bunch of other traits
[17:23.590 --> 17:27.070]  that we measure, stalk diameter, number of nodes,
[17:27.070 --> 17:31.390]  peteal length, bud count, it has no relationship.
[17:31.390 --> 17:34.110]  This is all data from birthday paper.
[17:36.590 --> 17:39.590]  And that is probably due to recombination.
[17:39.590 --> 17:41.670]  Recombination is this wonderful process
[17:41.670 --> 17:44.230]  that sexual individuals undergo.
[17:44.230 --> 17:46.350]  We have, again, a chromosome from dad
[17:46.350 --> 17:48.070]  and a chromosome from mom,
[17:48.070 --> 17:50.230]  and then a chunk of the chromosome swaps.
[17:50.230 --> 17:52.830]  So we get a chunk of the chromosome from mom,
[17:52.830 --> 17:55.430]  in dad's chromosome and et cetera, right?
[17:55.430 --> 17:57.350]  Recombination kind of looks like this.
[17:57.350 --> 17:58.710]  It's not just one little chunk,
[17:58.710 --> 18:00.110]  but there's multiple places
[18:00.110 --> 18:02.110]  where these chromosomes recombine.
[18:02.110 --> 18:05.590]  And thanks to recombination, we have a bunch of variation.
[18:05.630 --> 18:06.790]  And thanks to recombination,
[18:06.790 --> 18:08.430]  we differ from our siblings, right?
[18:08.430 --> 18:11.470]  It's one of the ways where we differ from our siblings.
[18:11.470 --> 18:14.270]  And maybe we share, I don't know, hair color
[18:14.270 --> 18:16.270]  or the shape of our eyes,
[18:16.270 --> 18:18.350]  but we are different from our siblings
[18:18.350 --> 18:21.670]  and recombination is one of the reasons.
[18:21.670 --> 18:22.830]  And thanks to recombination,
[18:22.830 --> 18:26.150]  we have red hair with blue eyes,
[18:26.150 --> 18:27.430]  brown hair with blue eyes,
[18:27.430 --> 18:29.630]  blonde hair with blue eyes, and so on.
[18:29.630 --> 18:33.590]  It's a great way to shuffle genes around
[18:33.590 --> 18:36.510]  and to create novel combinations.
[18:39.030 --> 18:43.630]  So when they tell you that indicas are tall
[18:43.630 --> 18:45.750]  and have this particular leaf shape
[18:45.750 --> 18:50.150]  and sativas or sativas are short, whatever it is,
[18:50.150 --> 18:53.390]  be skeptical because all of these traits
[18:53.390 --> 18:55.310]  can be shuffled around,
[18:57.110 --> 18:59.390]  especially all of these compounds
[18:59.390 --> 19:00.910]  because cannabis again produces
[19:00.910 --> 19:03.030]  a bunch of different compounds.
[19:03.590 --> 19:06.550]  Which leads me to the second part of my talk
[19:06.550 --> 19:08.670]  about cannabinoid genes.
[19:08.670 --> 19:12.190]  But to conclude this first part,
[19:12.190 --> 19:14.950]  cannabis has a lot of genomic variation,
[19:14.950 --> 19:16.990]  a lot of phenotypic variation.
[19:17.950 --> 19:19.550]  A bunch of these phenotypic traits
[19:19.550 --> 19:21.830]  are not correlated to each other,
[19:21.830 --> 19:25.790]  can be shuffled around and broken by recombination.
[19:25.790 --> 19:27.950]  Perhaps many different combinations
[19:27.950 --> 19:29.590]  are possible through breeding, right?
[19:29.590 --> 19:33.190]  Many different combinations that we do not see yet.
[19:33.830 --> 19:36.230]  The genome assembly still need a lot of work.
[19:36.230 --> 19:38.630]  We have very good assemblies,
[19:38.630 --> 19:41.270]  but we still do not have a good assembly
[19:41.270 --> 19:44.670]  of the white chromosome or of the monoecious chromosomes.
[19:46.310 --> 19:49.790]  So now I'm gonna start talking about the cannabinoid genes.
[19:51.750 --> 19:53.430]  Okay, so cannabinoid genes.
[19:53.430 --> 19:56.750]  So this graph is a very important graph.
[19:56.750 --> 19:59.070]  I've shown it in multiple talks.
[19:59.070 --> 20:00.590]  I wanna clarify something.
[20:00.590 --> 20:03.510]  This is just the last snippet
[20:03.510 --> 20:05.830]  of a huge biochemical pathway, right?
[20:05.830 --> 20:07.270]  This is just the last step
[20:07.270 --> 20:09.150]  of this huge biochemical pathway.
[20:10.310 --> 20:11.990]  When we talk about cannabinoid genes,
[20:11.990 --> 20:15.070]  we're talking about the genes that code for these enzymes,
[20:15.070 --> 20:16.830]  these three synthesis, right?
[20:16.830 --> 20:19.790]  I'm gonna talk about three cannabinoids
[20:19.790 --> 20:22.910]  of the multiple cannabinoids that cannabis produces.
[20:22.910 --> 20:26.550]  And those are THCA, CBDA, and CBCA.
[20:26.550 --> 20:30.030]  So these enzymes are proteins that perform a job.
[20:30.030 --> 20:31.350]  They do something.
[20:31.350 --> 20:35.070]  In this case, this synthesis, these enzymes take CBGA,
[20:35.070 --> 20:37.550]  so cannabijerolic acid,
[20:37.550 --> 20:42.550]  and convert it into other THCA, CBDA, or CBCA.
[20:43.710 --> 20:47.590]  Now, from this pink side up,
[20:47.590 --> 20:50.430]  all of this happens inside of the plant.
[20:50.430 --> 20:53.670]  And when we heat these compounds up,
[20:53.670 --> 20:54.790]  when we heat them up,
[20:54.790 --> 20:57.990]  they turn into THC, CBD, and CBC,
[20:57.990 --> 21:00.750]  but this is outside of the plant, right?
[21:00.750 --> 21:04.190]  So through heat, that's why baking, vaping, smoking,
[21:04.190 --> 21:08.070]  we heat them up, and they turn into the neutral forms.
[21:08.070 --> 21:09.670]  So the neutral forms, right,
[21:09.670 --> 21:12.070]  tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol,
[21:12.070 --> 21:14.390]  they lose this COOH, right?
[21:14.390 --> 21:18.110]  They go into the acidic form, into the neutral form.
[21:18.110 --> 21:20.790]  And again, this happens outside of the plant.
[21:20.790 --> 21:24.510]  These neutral forms are the ones that interact mostly
[21:24.510 --> 21:27.350]  with our endocannabinoid system.
[21:27.350 --> 21:31.030]  However, there is some evidence that the acidic forms
[21:31.030 --> 21:33.510]  also interact with the endocannabinoid system.
[21:34.670 --> 21:39.670]  But in any case, we have that these three enzymes
[21:39.790 --> 21:43.350]  use the same precursor molecule, they use CBGA.
[21:44.870 --> 21:47.390]  So under that definition,
[21:47.390 --> 21:50.590]  these three enzymes could be considered promiscuous enzymes
[21:50.590 --> 21:53.990]  because they are using the same precursor molecule.
[21:54.950 --> 21:57.870]  Now, when I was an undergrad,
[21:57.870 --> 22:01.190]  I was taught that enzymes are very specific,
[22:02.350 --> 22:05.190]  but this is not the case of these enzymes, at least.
[22:05.190 --> 22:07.070]  Apparently, it's not the case in general,
[22:07.070 --> 22:08.790]  but at least of none of these enzymes,
[22:08.790 --> 22:12.430]  we know that these enzymes in vitro,
[22:12.430 --> 22:17.030]  and this is thanks to a paper, Serpil et al. 2018,
[22:17.950 --> 22:21.230]  they show that these enzymes can produce
[22:21.270 --> 22:23.950]  up to eight different compounds,
[22:23.950 --> 22:25.670]  including each other's compounds.
[22:25.670 --> 22:27.470]  So in other words, THCA synthase
[22:27.470 --> 22:29.470]  can produce a little bit of CBGA,
[22:29.470 --> 22:32.510]  CBGA synthase a little bit of CBCA,
[22:32.510 --> 22:34.830]  CBCA, THCA, and so on.
[22:34.830 --> 22:38.510]  So these enzymes can be promiscuous and can be sloppy.
[22:39.750 --> 22:40.590]  Okay?
[22:41.470 --> 22:44.190]  So I want to define something,
[22:44.190 --> 22:47.870]  a gene is in a location in our chromosomes, right?
[22:47.870 --> 22:50.230]  So this is the same location for mom's chromosome
[22:50.230 --> 22:51.990]  and for dad's chromosome.
[22:51.990 --> 22:53.990]  And so it's a locus, right?
[22:53.990 --> 22:55.350]  So when we're talking about a locus,
[22:55.350 --> 22:57.590]  it's a specific location,
[22:57.590 --> 22:59.510]  and then allele is a form of a gene.
[22:59.510 --> 23:02.470]  And in this case, mom or dad could have the same allele,
[23:02.470 --> 23:05.110]  the same form of the gene, or they could differ.
[23:06.510 --> 23:07.670]  And at the beginning,
[23:07.670 --> 23:12.390]  we thought that if dad had both THCA and CBGA,
[23:12.390 --> 23:16.830]  so if dad was heterozygous and mom was also heterozygous,
[23:16.830 --> 23:18.550]  then the offspring, one quarter,
[23:18.590 --> 23:20.190]  would have THCA,
[23:20.190 --> 23:22.390]  two quarters would produce both compounds,
[23:22.390 --> 23:26.750]  and then one quarter would produce CBGA, right?
[23:26.750 --> 23:29.150]  So we thought that this was a one locus,
[23:29.150 --> 23:30.830]  two allele type of thing.
[23:30.830 --> 23:33.670]  It was the same gene that had two different forms,
[23:33.670 --> 23:35.310]  THCA and CBGA.
[23:36.550 --> 23:40.150]  And that's where we have this type one, type two, type three,
[23:40.150 --> 23:40.990]  right?
[23:40.990 --> 23:45.070]  Type one, high THCA, type two, both THCA and CBGA,
[23:45.070 --> 23:47.190]  and then type three, CBGA.
[23:48.750 --> 23:53.110]  And it wasn't until 2015 with a really good paper
[23:53.110 --> 23:55.110]  by George Weinblien,
[23:55.110 --> 23:57.590]  where they found one individual,
[23:57.590 --> 24:00.590]  they made a cross between a marijuana type and a hemp type,
[24:00.590 --> 24:03.870]  which is our CSN assembly.
[24:03.870 --> 24:06.150]  So they made this cross,
[24:06.150 --> 24:08.950]  and there was one individual that recombined.
[24:08.950 --> 24:11.230]  They had less than 100 individuals,
[24:11.230 --> 24:14.110]  I think it was around the 60s or the 70s.
[24:14.110 --> 24:16.870]  And there was one individual that got the THCA
[24:16.870 --> 24:19.670]  and the CBGA loci,
[24:19.670 --> 24:21.070]  one individual recombined.
[24:21.070 --> 24:22.470]  And thanks to that one individual,
[24:22.470 --> 24:25.870]  we found that these were two different genes
[24:25.870 --> 24:27.470]  that were in close proximity,
[24:27.470 --> 24:29.390]  approximately one Sany-Morgan apart,
[24:29.390 --> 24:31.990]  so one recombination event apart.
[24:31.990 --> 24:34.910]  So thanks to these recombination events,
[24:34.910 --> 24:39.030]  we now found that indeed these were two different genes
[24:39.030 --> 24:41.870]  that were in very close proximity,
[24:41.870 --> 24:44.070]  and that it was really hard to tear them apart
[24:44.070 --> 24:45.510]  because they were in close proximity.
[24:45.510 --> 24:48.750]  Again, when we used to play chain when we were kids,
[24:48.750 --> 24:51.390]  or maybe you still play chain right now, I'm not sure,
[24:51.390 --> 24:53.190]  but when we used to do that,
[24:53.190 --> 24:55.990]  it is harder to break people apart
[24:55.990 --> 24:57.230]  when they're close together.
[24:57.230 --> 25:01.270]  It is easier to break them apart when they're far apart.
[25:01.270 --> 25:03.910]  That's the same case as CBGA and THCA.
[25:03.910 --> 25:05.110]  They were very close together,
[25:05.110 --> 25:07.830]  and therefore it was very hard to tear them apart.
[25:10.030 --> 25:12.950]  So thanks to this one individual, this recombinant,
[25:13.950 --> 25:18.950]  Grasa used the same population with his paper.
[25:19.030 --> 25:21.670]  This is a paper that I was just talking about.
[25:21.670 --> 25:25.750]  George Weinblain is also part of this publication.
[25:26.990 --> 25:29.710]  And this is a very busy figure,
[25:29.710 --> 25:33.550]  but what I want you to take from this figure
[25:33.550 --> 25:37.430]  is that these genes indeed are very similar to each other.
[25:37.430 --> 25:38.950]  This shows the relationship.
[25:38.950 --> 25:40.790]  This part of the figure shows the relationship
[25:40.790 --> 25:42.030]  between the individuals.
[25:42.030 --> 25:43.910]  They're very similar to each other,
[25:43.910 --> 25:46.830]  and they are in very close proximity in the genome.
[25:46.830 --> 25:48.150]  All of these cannabinoid genes
[25:48.150 --> 25:50.630]  are in very close proximity in the genome.
[25:52.110 --> 25:54.430]  And this is what we see in their map.
[25:54.430 --> 25:56.510]  We see that all of the cannabinoid genes
[25:56.510 --> 25:58.550]  are in this chromosome.
[25:58.550 --> 26:00.830]  So at least the genes with major effects,
[26:00.830 --> 26:04.070]  the genes that have the most effects in cannabinoid production
[26:04.070 --> 26:06.910]  are on this chromosome,
[26:06.910 --> 26:10.630]  but there are multiple genes all over the genome
[26:10.630 --> 26:12.790]  that are related to cannabinoid production.
[26:15.810 --> 26:20.170]  Then in 2019, we had a paper where we discussed
[26:20.170 --> 26:23.650]  that all of the individuals have,
[26:23.650 --> 26:26.010]  all of the cannabis varieties
[26:26.010 --> 26:29.250]  differ in the number of cannabinoid genes.
[26:29.250 --> 26:32.010]  All of the different strains have different number of genes
[26:32.010 --> 26:37.010]  and that this variation in copy number in these genes
[26:37.730 --> 26:41.450]  could have associations to cannabinoid production.
[26:43.090 --> 26:45.770]  And indeed, when we look at the different assemblies,
[26:45.770 --> 26:48.050]  we can see that all of the assemblies
[26:48.050 --> 26:50.050]  differ in the number of genes, right?
[26:50.050 --> 26:52.250]  And we have, for example, this wild one
[26:52.250 --> 26:55.650]  that has eight copies of cannabinoid genes
[26:55.650 --> 26:59.010]  and Jamaican lion that apparently has up to 32.
[27:01.450 --> 27:03.450]  I also recommend this other paper
[27:03.450 --> 27:05.770]  that talks about cannabinoid genes,
[27:05.770 --> 27:08.130]  Van Velsen and Schrantz, published in 2021,
[27:08.130 --> 27:09.970]  that talks about the evolution
[27:09.970 --> 27:11.250]  and the origin of these genes.
[27:11.250 --> 27:13.330]  This is another must-read paper.
[27:14.770 --> 27:19.130]  So now we know that this THCA, CBDA being one gene,
[27:19.130 --> 27:22.810]  being one locus to alleles is not the case.
[27:24.090 --> 27:26.530]  So when we look at the genes,
[27:26.530 --> 27:29.530]  the cannabinoid genes from all of these different assemblies
[27:31.050 --> 27:32.570]  and we look at the relationship,
[27:32.570 --> 27:34.210]  again, I wanna make it clear
[27:34.210 --> 27:35.970]  that these are nine individuals.
[27:35.970 --> 27:38.890]  These are nine individuals that I'm showing in this slide,
[27:38.890 --> 27:40.370]  that these nine individuals differ
[27:40.490 --> 27:42.650]  in the number of cannabinoid genes.
[27:42.650 --> 27:45.610]  But when we look at the relationship of all of the genes
[27:45.610 --> 27:48.130]  from these nine individuals, this is what we see.
[27:48.130 --> 27:50.570]  And I'm not gonna go in depth into this graph,
[27:50.570 --> 27:54.450]  but what I want you to take from this graph is the following.
[27:54.450 --> 27:58.330]  There's a bunch of genes related to CBCA production,
[27:58.330 --> 28:02.530]  despite CBCA being produced in very low quantities.
[28:04.650 --> 28:07.890]  There are some genes related to THCA production
[28:07.890 --> 28:11.050]  and most of the individuals that have THCA
[28:11.050 --> 28:13.090]  are marijuana type cannibals.
[28:14.090 --> 28:15.850]  There's a bunch of genes that we don't know
[28:15.850 --> 28:16.850]  what they're doing.
[28:16.850 --> 28:17.810]  We have no idea.
[28:17.810 --> 28:21.530]  And every single one of the assemblies has a gene
[28:21.530 --> 28:25.970]  that falls into this category, in this unknown category.
[28:25.970 --> 28:29.530]  And there's some genes related to CBDA production.
[28:29.530 --> 28:33.050]  Some hemp have CBDA, some marijuana types have CBDA.
[28:34.050 --> 28:39.050]  So again, something that really caught my attention
[28:39.050 --> 28:40.890]  was for example, cannatonic.
[28:40.890 --> 28:43.130]  Again, this is one individual of cannatonic, right?
[28:43.130 --> 28:44.970]  So I'm drawing a bunch of conclusions
[28:44.970 --> 28:46.610]  based on one individual.
[28:46.610 --> 28:48.770]  However, cannatonic in the industry,
[28:48.770 --> 28:50.930]  it's sold as a one-to-one strain.
[28:50.930 --> 28:54.290]  So it's supposed to have one CBD and THC
[28:54.290 --> 28:56.090]  in equal proportions.
[28:56.090 --> 29:01.090]  However, cannatonic has a truncated CBDA gene,
[29:02.090 --> 29:06.770]  so an incomplete CBDA gene and an incomplete THCA gene.
[29:06.770 --> 29:08.810]  So it makes us wonder, right?
[29:08.810 --> 29:10.610]  If that one individual cannatonic,
[29:10.610 --> 29:14.890]  if there's other genes that may be coming together
[29:14.890 --> 29:18.170]  to form this cannabinoid phenotype, right?
[29:18.170 --> 29:21.970]  So we have then two genes or multiple genes
[29:21.970 --> 29:24.730]  that come together to form the phenotype.
[29:24.730 --> 29:27.810]  And in biology, we call that epistasis,
[29:27.810 --> 29:31.050]  where genes interact to form a phenotype.
[29:33.370 --> 29:36.490]  So perhaps all of these genes
[29:37.370 --> 29:40.930]  are interacting to form the phenotype, right?
[29:40.930 --> 29:42.570]  So what does the phenotype tells us?
[29:42.570 --> 29:45.930]  So this is a paper that is in press right now
[29:45.930 --> 29:48.490]  with my collaborators from Leafly.
[29:49.730 --> 29:52.250]  Here in the vertical axis, the Y axis,
[29:52.250 --> 29:54.730]  we have cannabinoid concentration.
[29:54.730 --> 29:56.050]  And here in the X axis,
[29:56.050 --> 29:58.090]  we have the different cannabinoids.
[29:58.090 --> 30:02.010]  And I want, so this figure is a little biased
[30:02.010 --> 30:05.210]  because this is the cannabis found in dispensaries.
[30:05.210 --> 30:07.490]  So of course the cannabis found in dispensaries
[30:07.490 --> 30:09.570]  have high THC.
[30:09.570 --> 30:12.410]  And we are not taking into account cannabis
[30:12.410 --> 30:15.930]  from hemp, right?
[30:15.930 --> 30:19.210]  We do not have hemp for fiber or for oil.
[30:19.210 --> 30:22.010]  It's not represented in dispensaries.
[30:22.010 --> 30:25.130]  But the cannabis from dispensaries,
[30:25.130 --> 30:26.970]  we have a lot of THC.
[30:26.970 --> 30:31.370]  The median is between 15 to 20, maybe 18%.
[30:31.370 --> 30:35.050]  Some individuals produce a lot of CBD.
[30:35.050 --> 30:36.810]  There's some CBG,
[30:36.810 --> 30:41.690]  but really most of the cannabinoids are negligible, right?
[30:41.690 --> 30:45.250]  Again, it's interesting that CBC is produced
[30:45.250 --> 30:46.690]  in very low quantities,
[30:46.690 --> 30:48.850]  despite there being a bunch of genes
[30:48.850 --> 30:50.650]  related to CBC production.
[30:51.650 --> 30:53.210]  And if we look at the relationship
[30:53.210 --> 30:56.770]  between THC concentration in the X axis,
[30:56.770 --> 30:59.490]  the horizontal axis, and CBD in the Y axis,
[30:59.490 --> 31:00.330]  the vertical axis,
[31:00.330 --> 31:01.610]  we see that there's some individuals
[31:01.610 --> 31:05.090]  that produce a lot of THC and very little CBD.
[31:05.090 --> 31:08.170]  Some individuals that produce a lot of CBD and little THC
[31:08.170 --> 31:10.210]  and some individuals in between.
[31:13.150 --> 31:18.150]  Now, if we look at leaf shape and cannabinoids, right?
[31:19.030 --> 31:22.750]  So again, males are the squares, females are the circles.
[31:22.750 --> 31:25.350]  And if we look at leaf shape and cannabinoids,
[31:25.350 --> 31:28.430]  perhaps we would be expecting two groups, right?
[31:28.430 --> 31:30.270]  That maybe these individuals over here
[31:30.270 --> 31:33.430]  have a particular chemotype and have a squat leaf.
[31:33.430 --> 31:36.270]  These individuals over here have another chemotype
[31:36.270 --> 31:37.670]  and an elongated leaf,
[31:37.670 --> 31:39.550]  or maybe even four different groups
[31:39.550 --> 31:43.230]  with four different chemotypes and four different leaf shapes,
[31:43.230 --> 31:45.150]  but that's not what we see.
[31:45.150 --> 31:48.790]  We see that leaf shape has no correlation whatsoever
[31:48.790 --> 31:50.550]  with cannabinoid content.
[31:50.550 --> 31:53.310]  So you can have high THC and have an elongated leaf
[31:53.310 --> 31:54.990]  or high THC and a squat leaf
[31:54.990 --> 31:57.430]  that has no relationship whatsoever.
[31:59.070 --> 32:04.070]  So again, when they tell you that indicas are one way
[32:04.670 --> 32:06.630]  and broad leaves and high cannabinoids
[32:06.630 --> 32:09.110]  and sativas are another way, be skeptical.
[32:10.790 --> 32:15.790]  However, we do see between cannabinoids here in the X axis,
[32:17.630 --> 32:20.030]  in the horizontal axis and terpenes,
[32:20.070 --> 32:23.070]  we do see that there is a correlation.
[32:23.070 --> 32:25.150]  So the more cannabinoids you produce,
[32:25.150 --> 32:27.110]  the more terpenes you produce.
[32:28.110 --> 32:31.750]  Now, this correlation is not very strong,
[32:31.750 --> 32:35.590]  but it is significant, which makes us wonder
[32:35.590 --> 32:38.190]  whether there are some genes that are related
[32:38.190 --> 32:40.670]  to both cannabinoid and terpene production.
[32:41.430 --> 32:44.070]  And I can think about some, for example,
[32:45.870 --> 32:49.830]  trichome density or trichome number, right?
[32:50.630 --> 32:52.790]  We know that in the trichomes is where we have
[32:52.790 --> 32:55.190]  the production of all of these compounds.
[32:56.030 --> 33:00.510]  Most of the trichomes are abundant in female flowers.
[33:00.510 --> 33:03.830]  So perhaps if you have a lot of trichomes
[33:03.830 --> 33:05.270]  or if you have big trichomes,
[33:05.270 --> 33:08.830]  you're gonna produce both a lot of cannabinoids
[33:08.830 --> 33:10.110]  and a lot of terpenes.
[33:11.990 --> 33:16.990]  And Zagara et al in 2019,
[33:17.270 --> 33:22.270]  they do suggest that there is an interaction between genes,
[33:22.590 --> 33:24.870]  that there is a network between genes
[33:24.870 --> 33:28.310]  that are acting together to produce the cannabinoid
[33:28.310 --> 33:29.750]  and the terpene phenotype.
[33:29.750 --> 33:33.110]  And this is another must-read paper in my opinion,
[33:34.350 --> 33:36.990]  which leads me to the last part of my talk
[33:36.990 --> 33:39.150]  about terpene genes.
[33:40.230 --> 33:42.270]  But to conclude this part,
[33:43.190 --> 33:46.470]  there are many genes related to cannabinoid production.
[33:46.470 --> 33:50.310]  All of these genes are interacting to produce a phenotype.
[33:50.310 --> 33:51.710]  That's still a question.
[33:52.870 --> 33:55.590]  Individuals differ in the number of cannabinoid genes.
[33:55.590 --> 33:57.350]  So there is copy number variation
[33:57.350 --> 34:00.270]  associated to cannabinoid production.
[34:00.270 --> 34:03.150]  And cannabinoids and other phenotypes
[34:03.150 --> 34:05.390]  are not related to each other.
[34:06.630 --> 34:08.270]  So terpene genes.
[34:09.670 --> 34:11.550]  And I wanna start with this graph,
[34:11.550 --> 34:13.190]  again, showing the relationship
[34:13.190 --> 34:16.630]  between terpene synthase genes, TPS.
[34:16.630 --> 34:20.630]  And this is by my colleagues at Front Range Biosciences.
[34:21.830 --> 34:25.190]  So something that I want you to see from this graph
[34:25.190 --> 34:28.190]  is that it appears that there's many genes related,
[34:28.190 --> 34:31.310]  for example, to the production of beta-mercine
[34:31.310 --> 34:35.710]  or to limonene and beta-ocemine, right?
[34:37.270 --> 34:40.310]  And if we look at this other paper by Booth et al,
[34:40.310 --> 34:44.670]  again, 2019, I think that 2019 was the year of the terpene.
[34:44.670 --> 34:49.550]  So we see that in the different chromosomes in cannabis,
[34:49.550 --> 34:51.270]  there are multiple genes related
[34:51.270 --> 34:52.950]  to terpene and cannabinoid production.
[34:52.950 --> 34:56.310]  So all of these genes are scattered throughout the genome.
[34:56.310 --> 35:01.310]  Again, supporting that idea from Zagor et al,
[35:01.350 --> 35:04.550]  that there are multiple genes acting in unison
[35:04.550 --> 35:07.790]  to produce this cannabinoid and this terpene phenotype.
[35:08.790 --> 35:12.710]  So I talked to you about epistasis,
[35:12.710 --> 35:15.310]  where it's genes interacting,
[35:15.310 --> 35:18.350]  but perhaps we also have pleiotropy,
[35:18.350 --> 35:20.670]  where we have one gene
[35:20.670 --> 35:23.790]  that is affecting two different phenotypes, right?
[35:23.790 --> 35:28.150]  So the expression of multiple traits by one gene.
[35:29.990 --> 35:32.310]  So perhaps what's going on with the terpenes
[35:32.310 --> 35:35.270]  is that, for example, we have TPS5
[35:35.270 --> 35:38.750]  that is related to the production of beta-mercine,
[35:38.750 --> 35:43.070]  but we also have TPS23 and TPS12.
[35:43.070 --> 35:45.430]  And perhaps we also have that TPS5
[35:45.430 --> 35:49.070]  is related to the production of limonene and beta-pinene.
[35:49.070 --> 35:51.310]  And then TPS12 is also related
[35:51.310 --> 35:55.070]  to the production of ocemine and so on,
[35:55.070 --> 35:58.070]  which is what Zagor et al are proposing.
[35:59.630 --> 36:02.230]  So maybe we have, between cannabinoids and terpenes,
[36:02.230 --> 36:05.270]  we have pleiotropy and epistasis in place,
[36:05.270 --> 36:08.390]  genes interacting to produce this phenotype.
[36:08.390 --> 36:11.230]  So now what does the phenotype tell us?
[36:11.230 --> 36:16.230]  And again, this is a graph from our leaflet paper
[36:16.950 --> 36:20.070]  that is only analyzing the cannabis from dispensaries.
[36:20.070 --> 36:22.550]  So it is a biased sample,
[36:22.550 --> 36:24.950]  but the cannabis from dispensaries,
[36:24.950 --> 36:28.350]  this is what we see in the Y-axis, the vertical axis.
[36:28.350 --> 36:30.390]  We have total terpene concentration,
[36:30.430 --> 36:33.030]  and here we have all of the different terpenes.
[36:33.030 --> 36:35.550]  And we see that the cannabis from dispensaries
[36:35.550 --> 36:39.070]  is high in beta-mercine, beta-cariophylline, and limonene.
[36:39.070 --> 36:42.910]  So if you go today at a dispensary,
[36:42.910 --> 36:45.950]  it's likely that you can buy something
[36:45.950 --> 36:49.270]  that has high beta-mercine, beta-cariophylline, or limonene.
[36:51.510 --> 36:53.190]  Now I'm gonna show another
[36:53.190 --> 36:55.190]  principal component analysis graph.
[36:56.790 --> 36:59.670]  Here, again, this is a dimensionality reduction,
[36:59.670 --> 37:02.670]  and each of the dots is an individual.
[37:02.670 --> 37:05.670]  And PC1, principal component one,
[37:05.670 --> 37:07.230]  explains the most variation.
[37:07.230 --> 37:10.030]  Then PC2 explains the next more variation.
[37:10.030 --> 37:13.190]  And between these two, in this particular graph,
[37:13.190 --> 37:14.590]  between these two,
[37:14.590 --> 37:18.510]  we're explaining about 60% of the variation,
[37:18.510 --> 37:20.310]  which is pretty high.
[37:21.230 --> 37:26.230]  So we would be expecting that if the sativa in red
[37:26.350 --> 37:28.350]  and the indica and the hybrid
[37:28.350 --> 37:29.630]  explain the variation,
[37:29.630 --> 37:31.710]  perhaps we would see something like this, right?
[37:31.710 --> 37:34.510]  Where the sativas are in a corner
[37:34.510 --> 37:36.790]  with a particular chemotype,
[37:36.790 --> 37:39.150]  and the indicas are in another corner
[37:39.150 --> 37:40.950]  with a particular chemotype,
[37:40.950 --> 37:43.470]  and then the hybrids are in between.
[37:45.190 --> 37:46.790]  However, that's not what we see.
[37:47.750 --> 37:50.870]  What we see is that the sativas and the indicas
[37:50.870 --> 37:55.630]  and the hybrids do not explain the chemotypic variation.
[37:55.630 --> 37:57.710]  Again, this is a dimensionality reduction,
[37:57.710 --> 38:00.350]  so we're taking all of the variation in chemotype
[38:00.350 --> 38:03.030]  and we're showing it in two different dimensions,
[38:03.030 --> 38:04.910]  PC1 and PC2 in this case.
[38:05.990 --> 38:09.430]  But we see that it doesn't matter if you're an indica
[38:09.430 --> 38:10.790]  or a sativa or a hybrid,
[38:10.790 --> 38:12.030]  according to the industry,
[38:12.030 --> 38:14.750]  that doesn't say anything about your chemotype.
[38:16.270 --> 38:20.750]  However, if we partition this same graph
[38:20.750 --> 38:23.070]  by the most common terpene,
[38:23.070 --> 38:25.190]  we see a different thing,
[38:25.190 --> 38:27.310]  and we can see different clusters.
[38:27.910 --> 38:29.110]  We can see that in this corner,
[38:29.110 --> 38:32.550]  we have individuals that have high beta-mercine, right?
[38:32.550 --> 38:36.350]  This is the most prominent terpene.
[38:36.350 --> 38:37.910]  And we can see that over here,
[38:37.910 --> 38:41.550]  we have the individuals that are high in terpenoline.
[38:42.950 --> 38:46.790]  And then when we take this same graph
[38:46.790 --> 38:51.790]  and we partition it using another mathematical algorithm,
[38:52.150 --> 38:55.950]  we can see that it clusters in three different,
[38:55.950 --> 38:58.310]  we can see three different clusters.
[38:58.310 --> 39:01.870]  One cluster that is high in caryophylline and limonene
[39:01.870 --> 39:03.430]  here in pink,
[39:03.430 --> 39:06.070]  another cluster here in blue,
[39:06.070 --> 39:08.350]  high in myrcene and pinene,
[39:08.350 --> 39:09.830]  and another cluster here,
[39:09.830 --> 39:12.590]  high in terpenoline and myrcene.
[39:12.590 --> 39:15.230]  So it seems that terpenes
[39:15.230 --> 39:20.230]  are better at clustering cannabis strains
[39:21.710 --> 39:24.710]  than the industry names.
[39:24.710 --> 39:27.270]  So again, when they tell you
[39:27.270 --> 39:30.670]  that sativas have a particular smell
[39:30.670 --> 39:32.750]  associated with a particular height,
[39:32.750 --> 39:34.550]  with a particular leaf shape,
[39:34.550 --> 39:36.790]  and indicas have another smell
[39:36.790 --> 39:40.270]  with a particular other height and another leaf shape,
[39:40.270 --> 39:42.310]  be very, very skeptical.
[39:43.830 --> 39:46.870]  So to conclude this part of my talk,
[39:46.870 --> 39:50.550]  there are many genes related to terpene production.
[39:50.550 --> 39:52.150]  Are all these genes interacting
[39:52.150 --> 39:53.710]  to produce a terpene phenotype?
[39:53.710 --> 39:55.870]  Again, that question remains.
[39:55.870 --> 39:59.790]  And terpenes seem to be better at grouping individuals
[39:59.790 --> 40:01.510]  than industry names.
[40:02.390 --> 40:05.470]  And to conclude my talk overall,
[40:05.470 --> 40:09.550]  there is a lot of phenotypic and genomic diversity
[40:09.550 --> 40:10.430]  in cannabis.
[40:10.430 --> 40:13.390]  Perhaps we can breed for strains
[40:13.390 --> 40:16.270]  that have not yet been developed.
[40:17.710 --> 40:20.950]  Cannabinoids and terpenes show a mild correlation.
[40:20.950 --> 40:23.310]  It seems that there could be genes
[40:23.910 --> 40:25.150]  that are affecting both.
[40:27.030 --> 40:29.710]  Cannabinoids are highly correlated between them.
[40:30.870 --> 40:33.710]  And there's multiple genes related to cannabinoid
[40:33.710 --> 40:34.910]  and terpene production.
[40:34.910 --> 40:37.350]  These genes are scattered throughout the genome.
[40:38.150 --> 40:41.710]  Terpenes are better at grouping strains than industry names.
[40:41.710 --> 40:45.030]  And many important traits by the cannabis industry
[40:45.030 --> 40:47.430]  are not related to each other.
[40:48.430 --> 40:52.470]  So again, when they tell you about indican sativa,
[40:52.470 --> 40:54.270]  be skeptical.
[40:54.270 --> 40:57.110]  And again, I want to thank all of my collaborators
[40:57.110 --> 41:00.030]  from academia and the industry.
[41:00.030 --> 41:02.830]  And I wanna give a shout out today on 420
[41:02.830 --> 41:04.310]  to all of my friends.
[41:04.310 --> 41:06.030]  Most of these are in Colorado.
[41:06.030 --> 41:09.070]  So I wanna say hi to all of you
[41:09.070 --> 41:11.950]  and my new friends here in New York State.
[41:13.390 --> 41:15.390]  And with that, visit our website,
[41:15.390 --> 41:17.710]  Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[41:18.950 --> 41:21.310]  And this is my contact information.
[41:21.310 --> 41:23.950]  And I am happy to take any questions.
[41:23.950 --> 41:24.790]  Thank you.
[41:25.750 --> 41:26.950]  Outstanding, Daniela.
[41:26.950 --> 41:29.110]  Thank you so much for that wonderful talk.
[41:30.190 --> 41:31.630]  Yeah, that was fantastic.
[41:31.630 --> 41:32.870]  Thank you.
[41:32.870 --> 41:34.150]  First question.
[41:34.150 --> 41:36.470]  Do the neutral forms of cannabinoids
[41:36.470 --> 41:39.230]  appear in the plant in low concentrations
[41:39.230 --> 41:42.990]  like during storage or drying or in a warm environment
[41:42.990 --> 41:45.350]  or heating from overhead lights or the sun?
[41:47.230 --> 41:49.150]  Yes, they do.
[41:49.150 --> 41:50.190]  Yes, definitely.
[41:50.190 --> 41:53.870]  Yeah, we do see that the neutral forms
[41:53.870 --> 41:56.110]  accumulating very low quantities.
[41:56.110 --> 41:57.750]  You do have to heat them up for them
[41:57.750 --> 42:00.510]  to accumulating in higher quantities,
[42:00.510 --> 42:03.070]  but yes, you do see a little bit.
[42:03.070 --> 42:03.910]  Yeah.
[42:06.910 --> 42:07.990]  Next question.
[42:08.950 --> 42:12.550]  What is your opinion on the use of feminized seeds
[42:12.550 --> 42:15.350]  in the cultivation and breeding of cannabis?
[42:16.870 --> 42:19.550]  Has the breeding done by the legacy market
[42:19.910 --> 42:21.670]  or has it contaminated the cannabis genome
[42:21.670 --> 42:24.870]  through breeding with feminized seeds?
[42:26.670 --> 42:27.910]  That is an interesting question.
[42:27.910 --> 42:31.310]  So I don't know, contaminated, I wouldn't say that.
[42:31.310 --> 42:32.390]  You know, when you're breeding,
[42:32.390 --> 42:34.630]  you're choosing for a particular trait.
[42:34.630 --> 42:37.550]  So I wouldn't say that it has contaminated.
[42:37.550 --> 42:41.950]  Now, okay, so feminized seeds.
[42:41.950 --> 42:43.270]  So what are feminized seeds?
[42:43.270 --> 42:46.190]  So something that I didn't talk about in cannabis
[42:46.190 --> 42:49.710]  is that when you stress the plant,
[42:49.710 --> 42:52.750]  so that means that you could apply particular hormones
[42:52.750 --> 42:55.190]  or that you can change light regimes.
[42:55.190 --> 42:57.710]  There are certain genes that are turned on
[42:57.710 --> 42:59.430]  and you can have a female
[42:59.430 --> 43:03.470]  and you can make that female produce pollen.
[43:03.470 --> 43:08.270]  So then you have a female that has two X chromosomes
[43:08.270 --> 43:10.550]  and that female produces pollen
[43:10.550 --> 43:12.870]  and you take that pollen from that female
[43:12.870 --> 43:17.870]  and self-fertilize her or fertilize another female friend.
[43:20.630 --> 43:23.470]  So then the seeds that are produced
[43:23.470 --> 43:26.470]  do not have a Y chromosome, right?
[43:26.470 --> 43:28.470]  So you're assuring that those seeds
[43:28.470 --> 43:29.990]  do not have a Y chromosome.
[43:29.990 --> 43:31.710]  They only have X chromosomes.
[43:31.710 --> 43:34.750]  That's why they're called feminized seeds.
[43:34.750 --> 43:37.710]  Now, several things.
[43:37.710 --> 43:41.750]  You don't know whether indeed those individuals,
[43:41.750 --> 43:44.110]  those seeds, whether they're not gonna have
[43:44.110 --> 43:46.390]  the possibility of producing pollen
[43:46.390 --> 43:49.990]  if you stress them out or if you apply hormones.
[43:49.990 --> 43:51.150]  Perhaps they do.
[43:51.150 --> 43:53.870]  And in fact, many of the feminized seeds,
[43:53.870 --> 43:56.390]  there is a low percentage of individuals
[43:56.390 --> 43:57.790]  that do produce pollen.
[43:59.350 --> 44:01.190]  So that regarding feminized seeds,
[44:01.190 --> 44:03.190]  I think that feminized seeds are great.
[44:03.190 --> 44:05.230]  If they work for you, why not?
[44:07.150 --> 44:09.350]  Now, the legacy growers,
[44:09.350 --> 44:11.750]  I mean, the legacy growers have a legacy
[44:11.750 --> 44:15.070]  and they have the word legacy attached to them for a reason.
[44:16.190 --> 44:17.550]  I think that in general,
[44:17.550 --> 44:20.550]  the breeding cannabis has not been very stringent
[44:25.190 --> 44:26.470]  for many reasons, right?
[44:26.470 --> 44:28.630]  Because cannabis has been illegal for so long
[44:28.630 --> 44:30.630]  that people have been breeding in their closets
[44:30.630 --> 44:33.230]  and their basement, literally, right?
[44:33.230 --> 44:36.030]  So it's really hard when you don't have enough space
[44:36.030 --> 44:38.070]  in your closet or in your basement
[44:38.070 --> 44:43.070]  to do good breeding, to breed for multiple individuals.
[44:43.790 --> 44:44.990]  You don't have space.
[44:44.990 --> 44:49.390]  You cannot grow 300 individuals, 500 individuals
[44:49.390 --> 44:52.390]  that you need when you're doing breeding.
[44:52.390 --> 44:57.390]  So in that sense, I do think that legacy growers
[44:57.550 --> 45:00.030]  have worked with the things that they have in hand
[45:00.030 --> 45:01.430]  and that they have done.
[45:01.430 --> 45:03.030]  They have done really good things
[45:03.030 --> 45:06.430]  with the possibilities that they have available, I think.
[45:09.530 --> 45:11.010]  Awesome.
[45:11.010 --> 45:13.010]  Next question.
[45:13.010 --> 45:15.650]  Were you able to, or do you believe it's possible
[45:15.650 --> 45:19.730]  to accurately determine cannabinoid levels in a plant,
[45:19.730 --> 45:22.290]  marijuana or hemp, using only leaves?
[45:24.610 --> 45:26.290]  Cannabinoid levels?
[45:26.290 --> 45:27.130]  I don't know.
[45:27.130 --> 45:28.770]  I think that you need the flower,
[45:28.770 --> 45:33.770]  but what I do know is that the ratios of cannabinoids,
[45:36.010 --> 45:38.010]  if you do it, even when the plant is little,
[45:38.490 --> 45:41.330]  the ratios do not change that much through time.
[45:41.330 --> 45:43.450]  And I'm not sure, I know that the leaves,
[45:43.450 --> 45:46.130]  and especially sugar leaves, those have a lot of trichomes,
[45:46.130 --> 45:48.090]  so they are gonna show cannabinoid,
[45:48.090 --> 45:49.410]  but I don't know if they're gonna show
[45:49.410 --> 45:51.410]  as much cannabinoids as a flower.
[45:51.410 --> 45:53.770]  Perhaps the ratios are gonna be the same,
[45:53.770 --> 45:55.730]  but the amounts are gonna differ.
[46:00.700 --> 46:01.540]  Great.
[46:02.460 --> 46:03.580]  Another question.
[46:05.780 --> 46:10.780]  Can you speak about variation in flowering time?
[46:10.900 --> 46:13.540]  And would you speculate that shorter flowering times
[46:13.540 --> 46:16.860]  may have some relationship to C. ruderalis?
[46:18.340 --> 46:19.540]  Flowering time.
[46:19.540 --> 46:22.620]  Oh, that's Larry Smart's baby.
[46:22.620 --> 46:25.580]  So can I speak about flowering time?
[46:25.580 --> 46:27.860]  We know that there is variation in flowering time, right?
[46:27.860 --> 46:30.820]  We know that there is, yeah,
[46:30.820 --> 46:32.700]  that there is variation in flowering time,
[46:32.700 --> 46:35.980]  and we know that depending on where you are
[46:35.980 --> 46:40.700]  or how many plants you wanna grow in a given time,
[46:41.500 --> 46:43.980]  you may wanna play with flowering time.
[46:43.980 --> 46:46.580]  If you want to grow several,
[46:47.820 --> 46:50.460]  if you wanna grow in one season,
[46:50.460 --> 46:51.980]  you wanna grow multiple plants,
[46:51.980 --> 46:54.540]  you wanna play with flowering time.
[46:55.740 --> 46:56.820]  Ruderalis.
[46:57.820 --> 46:59.780]  It seems like ruderalis is a thing.
[46:59.780 --> 47:03.340]  We still don't know, like up North in Siberia,
[47:03.340 --> 47:05.180]  it seems that it is a thing.
[47:05.180 --> 47:07.860]  Again, we don't know whether there's wild cannabis.
[47:08.020 --> 47:10.580]  We don't know whether the cannabis that it's found out
[47:10.580 --> 47:12.820]  is feral, you know, it escaped,
[47:12.820 --> 47:14.260]  or if it's indeed wild,
[47:14.260 --> 47:17.580]  we still do not know whether they're wild populations.
[47:17.580 --> 47:19.540]  And it seems that ruderalis is a thing.
[47:19.540 --> 47:22.300]  Indeed, you see these plants that are shorter
[47:22.300 --> 47:24.620]  and that are out of flower,
[47:24.620 --> 47:28.100]  and so they do not obey the light cues, right?
[47:28.100 --> 47:30.620]  So usually cannabis starts flowering
[47:30.620 --> 47:32.420]  when it senses that the light
[47:32.420 --> 47:37.420]  is diminishing during the fall months.
[47:38.180 --> 47:42.020]  But yeah, ruderalis, it seems that there's some plant,
[47:42.020 --> 47:43.580]  there is out of flowering plants.
[47:43.580 --> 47:45.180]  There are out of flowering plants.
[47:45.180 --> 47:46.860]  Now, whether or not those genes
[47:46.860 --> 47:48.940]  are coming from ruderalis or not,
[47:48.940 --> 47:52.500]  whether those genes indeed are associated to these plants,
[47:52.500 --> 47:53.980]  I think that that's a different question,
[47:53.980 --> 47:56.620]  but we could answer that question
[47:56.620 --> 47:59.740]  if we have sequencing of all of these ruderalis plants.
[47:59.740 --> 48:01.980]  And if we have good phenotyping data,
[48:02.540 --> 48:04.140]  we could answer those questions.
[48:07.120 --> 48:07.960]  Great.
[48:09.680 --> 48:11.320]  Another question, many questions.
[48:12.360 --> 48:17.360]  If you color the genetic PCA by terpene phenotype,
[48:17.360 --> 48:18.920]  is there any clustering there?
[48:20.760 --> 48:25.760]  If I color the terpene PCA by genetic phenotype, oh.
[48:26.880 --> 48:31.400]  Yeah, the genetic PCA by terpene variation, yeah.
[48:32.360 --> 48:37.360]  So what was that genetic PCA?
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.680]  Are they talking about the split-street graph?
[48:48.200 --> 48:51.440]  Because I don't think that I showed a genomic PCA,
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.440]  but okay, so I don't know, I didn't do that.
[48:57.320 --> 49:02.320]  But so far, I am showing here different datasets, right?
[49:03.720 --> 49:06.800]  In this talk, I show different datasets.
[49:06.800 --> 49:10.160]  Now, in an ideal world,
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.160]  we would have all phenotypes from each of the datasets
[49:15.160 --> 49:17.000]  and all genomics from the other datasets.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.240]  For example, with the leaflet dataset,
[49:19.240 --> 49:21.560]  we have a bunch of, you know,
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.960]  tens of thousands of chemotypes that we had available
[49:26.200 --> 49:27.920]  thanks to Leafly,
[49:27.920 --> 49:31.080]  but we did not have the genotype of those individuals,
[49:31.080 --> 49:35.800]  right, those were actually six different labs
[49:35.800 --> 49:38.960]  across the US, a lab in Florida, another in Michigan,
[49:38.960 --> 49:41.240]  another in California, in Washington,
[49:41.240 --> 49:43.840]  that people go to those labs to measure
[49:43.840 --> 49:46.240]  their cannabinoids and their terpenes.
[49:46.240 --> 49:51.240]  So we do not have pairing genetics datasets for them.
[49:55.970 --> 49:57.730]  That would be a really interesting question, right?
[49:57.890 --> 49:58.730]  Yeah.
[49:58.730 --> 50:01.730]  Mm-hmm, and expensive as well.
[50:01.730 --> 50:03.530]  Of course, everything's expensive.
[50:03.530 --> 50:04.850]  Yeah.
[50:04.850 --> 50:06.530]  Another question, kind of unrelated,
[50:06.530 --> 50:10.050]  so you mentioned where the labs were that generated
[50:10.050 --> 50:13.610]  that cannabinoid and terpene data.
[50:13.610 --> 50:15.770]  Do you know where the dispensaries were?
[50:15.770 --> 50:18.370]  Were they in the same states as where the labs were?
[50:20.410 --> 50:22.450]  I don't know.
[50:22.450 --> 50:24.770]  I know that the Leafly people do know.
[50:24.770 --> 50:29.770]  I was really excited to be part of that analysis
[50:29.850 --> 50:34.850]  because it's one of the biggest terpene cannabinoid
[50:36.050 --> 50:38.610]  chemotypes datasets that we've analyzed,
[50:38.610 --> 50:40.650]  and it was one of the best collaborations
[50:40.650 --> 50:42.530]  that I've had so far.
[50:42.530 --> 50:47.530]  And the four of us would meet on Fridays every two weeks,
[50:49.570 --> 50:51.570]  and it was a great collaboration.
[50:52.570 --> 50:55.730]  I know that there's six labs, independent labs,
[50:55.730 --> 50:59.450]  in six different places in the US.
[50:59.450 --> 51:02.810]  I was positively surprised by that dataset
[51:02.810 --> 51:06.210]  because the labs were very consistent with each other.
[51:07.170 --> 51:10.090]  The measurements were very consistent with each other,
[51:10.090 --> 51:12.530]  so I was positively surprised.
[51:14.850 --> 51:19.850]  So I don't know if Leafly is gonna make available
[51:21.970 --> 51:25.370]  the data or if the labs made available to Leafly
[51:25.370 --> 51:28.450]  the data from the dispensaries or from the people,
[51:28.450 --> 51:33.450]  which I actually think that it's not important, right?
[51:33.530 --> 51:35.970]  I mean, what's important is that, one,
[51:35.970 --> 51:37.490]  the labs were very consistent,
[51:37.490 --> 51:39.690]  and congratulations, cannabis industry,
[51:39.690 --> 51:42.810]  that despite still being federally illegal
[51:42.810 --> 51:45.490]  and still having so much restrictions,
[51:45.490 --> 51:49.610]  the labs are doing great job at measuring these chemotypes.
[51:49.610 --> 51:54.610]  So first and second, I think that that gives us,
[51:56.770 --> 51:59.330]  it gives us peace of mind that there are labs
[51:59.330 --> 52:02.410]  that you can take your cannabis
[52:02.410 --> 52:05.090]  and they're gonna do a good job at measuring it.
[52:05.090 --> 52:06.930]  So I think that that's independent
[52:06.930 --> 52:10.250]  of who the dispensary was or whether that was,
[52:10.250 --> 52:14.930]  I don't know, Purple Cush or Blue Dream,
[52:14.930 --> 52:15.970]  that doesn't matter.
[52:15.970 --> 52:18.570]  We have the data of the cannabinoids and terpenes
[52:18.570 --> 52:20.170]  that these strains had,
[52:20.170 --> 52:23.650]  and it's tens of thousands of strains.
[52:23.650 --> 52:26.530]  So we were able to measure a bunch of,
[52:26.530 --> 52:29.290]  and do a bunch of different statistics.
[52:29.290 --> 52:33.530]  And it was a very thorough statistic analysis
[52:33.530 --> 52:35.010]  that we did with that.
[52:38.510 --> 52:40.150]  Awesome.
[52:40.150 --> 52:41.750]  Another question.
[52:41.750 --> 52:44.750]  Is there evidence that terpenes or groups of terpenes
[52:44.750 --> 52:48.350]  are responsible for the sativa hybrid indica effects
[52:48.350 --> 52:50.750]  that are persisting in industry marketing?
[52:52.110 --> 52:54.310]  No, and that's what I just showed, right?
[52:54.310 --> 52:57.390]  So let me share my screen again.
[52:57.390 --> 53:01.990]  So this is the data that I just showed
[53:01.990 --> 53:06.990]  that, you know, like the industry says that,
[53:09.750 --> 53:13.990]  so the industry says that indica sativa hybrid,
[53:13.990 --> 53:16.150]  you have this particular characteristics
[53:16.150 --> 53:18.310]  which are not correct, right?
[53:19.150 --> 53:21.030]  We don't see that with the genome.
[53:21.030 --> 53:23.030]  We see that indica sativa hybrid,
[53:23.030 --> 53:28.030]  they are not related in any sort of genotype, right?
[53:28.030 --> 53:30.030]  And we don't see it with the phenotype either,
[53:30.030 --> 53:33.710]  whether we look at phenotypes like leaf shape or height
[53:33.710 --> 53:38.710]  or branching or nodes or males or females
[53:38.950 --> 53:41.550]  or terpenes or cannabinoids.
[53:41.550 --> 53:44.590]  So that indica sativa hybrid is,
[53:44.630 --> 53:48.110]  what the basis is for that indica sativa hybrid.
[53:48.110 --> 53:50.710]  Like it's kind of like saying, you know,
[53:50.710 --> 53:52.710]  like kind of relating like, okay,
[53:55.070 --> 53:58.910]  if you are blue eyed, you're always gonna be blonde.
[53:58.910 --> 54:01.070]  Like that has nothing to do with each other.
[54:01.070 --> 54:05.390]  Or if you are tall, you're always gonna have brown eyes.
[54:05.390 --> 54:07.350]  That has nothing to do with each other.
[54:07.350 --> 54:10.150]  Those traits are broken by recombination.
[54:10.150 --> 54:12.350]  So if we see this graph, right?
[54:12.350 --> 54:13.670]  We would be expecting, I mean,
[54:13.670 --> 54:15.230]  this is my main graph.
[54:15.230 --> 54:18.550]  Like it's not as pretty as what we actually really did.
[54:18.550 --> 54:22.510]  But if we would be expecting if the indica sativa hybrid,
[54:22.510 --> 54:23.990]  if it were true,
[54:23.990 --> 54:25.990]  we would be expecting that the indicas
[54:25.990 --> 54:27.270]  would cluster with each other
[54:27.270 --> 54:28.550]  and the sativas with each other.
[54:28.550 --> 54:31.510]  And maybe the hybrids are somewhere in between.
[54:31.510 --> 54:33.590]  But that's not what we see.
[54:33.590 --> 54:37.230]  We see that the names are not related whatsoever
[54:37.230 --> 54:39.230]  with the type of compounds.
[54:39.230 --> 54:42.670]  But we do see that we can cluster these strains
[54:42.670 --> 54:45.590]  based on the most common terpene
[54:45.590 --> 54:47.670]  or groups of terpenes, right?
[54:47.670 --> 54:49.910]  Here in this graph,
[54:49.910 --> 54:52.030]  when we do this clustering analysis,
[54:52.030 --> 54:55.590]  we do see this clear partition.
[54:55.590 --> 54:58.350]  And this clear partition is,
[54:58.350 --> 55:01.190]  we named the cluster one, cluster two, and cluster three,
[55:01.190 --> 55:04.310]  but you can call it, I don't know, Mary, Jim, and John,
[55:04.310 --> 55:05.390]  right?
[55:05.390 --> 55:09.110]  These three clusters do have particular terpenes
[55:09.110 --> 55:11.270]  which are the most abundant terpenes.
[55:11.270 --> 55:14.830]  So terpenes are better at clustering
[55:14.830 --> 55:19.880]  than the indica sativa hybrid.
[55:19.880 --> 55:24.400]  I don't know if that was clear.
[55:24.400 --> 55:26.680]  Awesome.
[55:26.680 --> 55:28.000]  Another question.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.120]  What do you think are the technical
[55:30.120 --> 55:31.840]  or computational bottlenecks
[55:31.840 --> 55:36.360]  for completing the whole cannabis genome?
[55:36.360 --> 55:38.320]  The technical or computational,
[55:38.320 --> 55:40.080]  I don't think that there are any technical
[55:40.080 --> 55:43.040]  or computational bottlenecks.
[55:43.080 --> 55:45.840]  I think that the bottlenecks are money
[55:45.840 --> 55:50.080]  because you require someone that knows a lot of bioinformatics
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.040]  and more money
[55:54.040 --> 55:59.200]  to sequence a really good white chromosome with long reads,
[55:59.200 --> 56:02.160]  you know, like a PacBio type of thing, long reads,
[56:02.160 --> 56:04.000]  and very high coverage.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.520]  So I would sequence a bunch of males with very long reads
[56:08.520 --> 56:11.000]  with very high coverage in both PacBio
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.280]  and corrected with Illumina.
[56:13.280 --> 56:15.760]  So that's some chunk of money,
[56:15.760 --> 56:17.680]  and then you would need a lot of people,
[56:17.680 --> 56:21.640]  good people that have really good bioinformatic skills
[56:21.640 --> 56:25.320]  that have a lot of time to dedicate to this, to do that.
[56:25.320 --> 56:28.360]  I think that one of the reasons why the white chromosome
[56:28.360 --> 56:31.160]  is not finished, it's because it's hard.
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.600]  It's huge, and it has a bunch of repetitive content.
[56:35.600 --> 56:38.720]  So it's really hard, you know, like you have blah,
[56:38.720 --> 56:40.320]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[56:40.320 --> 56:42.080]  It's really hard to put it together.
[56:42.080 --> 56:44.000]  It's really hard to build a puzzle.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.480]  So I think that it needs a lot of time,
[56:46.480 --> 56:52.840]  a lot of money to do it.
[56:52.840 --> 56:57.840]  Okay, I think we'll do one more question,
[56:57.840 --> 56:59.240]  and this will kind of bring us right back
[56:59.240 --> 57:00.640]  to where we started here.
[57:00.640 --> 57:04.320]  How do you think that we preserve the diversity
[57:04.320 --> 57:06.800]  in the cannabis genome so that we don't lose
[57:06.800 --> 57:09.880]  possible therapeutic effects on, you know,
[57:09.880 --> 57:12.440]  other diverse characteristics
[57:12.440 --> 57:13.880]  that may be present in the plant
[57:13.880 --> 57:15.800]  but have been overlooked in the past?
[57:17.600 --> 57:19.400]  Preserve the cannabis genome.
[57:19.400 --> 57:21.880]  Well, I think that that's what Zach and Tony
[57:21.880 --> 57:22.840]  are trying to do, right?
[57:22.840 --> 57:25.760]  I think that that's why the USDA and that repository
[57:25.760 --> 57:29.000]  is so important because that's the entire point, right?
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.960]  Preserving all of these different strains,
[57:30.960 --> 57:32.560]  all of these different varieties
[57:33.840 --> 57:37.160]  in order to have a big, a good library
[57:37.160 --> 57:40.720]  that represents the variation that's out there.
[57:40.720 --> 57:43.560]  And I remember that when Zach and I met,
[57:43.560 --> 57:47.320]  that was one of his questions, which I pondered
[57:47.320 --> 57:49.320]  and I discussed with multiple people,
[57:49.320 --> 57:52.080]  like how do we know that we are indeed
[57:52.080 --> 57:55.480]  having a good representation of what's out there?
[57:55.480 --> 57:58.560]  And if indeed those preliminary results are right,
[57:58.560 --> 58:00.840]  that cannabis has twice or three times
[58:00.840 --> 58:03.800]  as much variations as humans, at least,
[58:03.800 --> 58:08.000]  how many individuals do we need to have in that repository
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.840]  that are representative of what's out there?
[58:10.840 --> 58:14.440]  And what I recommend to people is, keep seeds.
[58:14.440 --> 58:16.880]  And then if you see a feral little guy
[58:16.880 --> 58:20.880]  and you see a ditch weed, do not ditch it.
[58:20.880 --> 58:23.680]  It may have really good characteristics.
[58:23.680 --> 58:26.680]  And yeah, so I think, or at least,
[58:27.840 --> 58:30.960]  try to give it to Zach somehow.
[58:31.840 --> 58:33.880]  I don't know what are the laws and the regulations
[58:33.880 --> 58:38.880]  with the USDA, but that is why Zach's
[58:39.040 --> 58:42.320]  and Tony's job is so crucial and so important.
[58:43.720 --> 58:46.720]  So just very, very briefly,
[58:46.720 --> 58:50.440]  I just wanna speak on everyone's behalf
[58:50.440 --> 58:51.560]  because I think it's true.
[58:51.560 --> 58:54.200]  That was a fascinating, mind-blowing,
[58:54.200 --> 58:58.240]  informative talk, Daniela, and you are a treasure.
[58:58.240 --> 58:59.720]  And thank you for your time.
[58:59.760 --> 59:04.760]  That was one of the highlights of the entire seminar series.
[59:05.360 --> 59:06.680]  So thank you again.
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.440]  And to the audience, we are very interested
[59:12.440 --> 59:14.520]  in hemogenetic diversity and conserving it
[59:14.520 --> 59:18.120]  for all of the reasons that Dr. Vergara illuminated.
[59:18.120 --> 59:19.640]  Please reach out to Tony and I,
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.000]  if you think you may hold some genetic diversity
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.400]  that we can conserve in the longterm.
[59:25.560 --> 59:29.360]  I just was curious, your vision of five, 10 years
[59:29.360 --> 59:33.200]  for hemogenetics, 20 years, what could that look like?
[59:34.840 --> 59:36.160]  Mine?
[59:36.160 --> 59:37.480]  Yes.
[59:37.480 --> 59:40.000]  Oh my God, that is such a good question.
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.520]  First, such a good question on 420.
[59:42.520 --> 59:44.800]  Please have a happy 420, everyone.
[59:44.800 --> 59:48.360]  But I've been thinking about the question now
[59:48.360 --> 59:50.760]  that I'm dealing with my job now requires me to work
[59:50.760 --> 59:53.400]  with people and with farmers.
[59:53.440 --> 59:56.640]  And I am gonna say something that may not be
[59:56.640 --> 59:58.880]  that popular among people,
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.880]  but I think that big companies and big corporations,
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.680]  which I'm not gonna name, I am not against them.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.600]  I think that many of them have done really good science.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.720]  However, I do think that there is a disconnect
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.440]  with what they propose and what the public gets.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.320]  I think that people need to be educated about genomics,
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.560]  not because you're all about it,
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.400]  not because you're all gonna become genomicists
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.920]  and bioinformaticians, but because when you understand it,
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.600]  you make better choices and educated choices.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.040]  I think that it's really important to know
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.320]  who is going to have this data.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.800]  GMOs are an excellent choice in my opinion.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.160]  GMOs and vaccines are kind of like mind blowing,
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:50.000]  like a movie, like a movie about a person
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.520]  like I think about it and it's like, wow.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.240]  And it's going to happen,
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.960]  but it's who is going to handle that data?
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.400]  Who is going to have access to that data?
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.000]  Is it gonna be few stakeholders,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.800]  which is what we've seen so far?
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.000]  Or is it gonna be part of the public realm?
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.640]  Are we all gonna have access to that?
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.720]  And I think that that is really important.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.600]  And I think that cannabis right now is in that point.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.040]  There's many companies that are looking,
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.480]  for example, flowering time genes.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.360]  There are several companies that have their eyes
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.680]  on flowering time genes.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.480]  Who is gonna hold those patents and those technologies?
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.600]  Is it gonna be two, three companies
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.480]  or is it gonna be all of us?
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.920]  So that's something that I hope that cannabis differs
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.200]  from other important crops.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.240]  Maybe a romantic way to end the presentation.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.840]  So I think we'll leave it at that.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.840]  Thank you so much, George and Tony
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.280]  and everyone that's contributed to this.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.440]  But once again, thanks again, Dr. Vergara.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.800]  Thank you.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.260]  Thank you, thank you very much.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.860]  I think we could have kept you in here for another hour
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.980]  just answering questions.
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:15.820]  Really?
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.020]  I'm looking at the Q&A.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.500]  We're in the consultee where I have it.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.100]  Or where the products came from.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.140]  These are really good questions.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.340]  As a follow-up, what is the thought of the difference?
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.660]  Oh, I know Matthew Indes was here.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.860]  Oh, I know some people.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.060]  So as a follow-up, so from Matthew Indes,
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.660]  what is thought to cause the difference in effect?
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.820]  I mean, I don't know the difference in effect
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.860]  because we have so many compounds
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.580]  interacting with each other.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.460]  That entourage effect is a very, in my opinion,
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:54.260]  it's a really interesting hypothesis.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.380]  And I think that you have different ratios of compounds
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.620]  and multiple of them.
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.500]  So if they're all interacting with each other,
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.060]  and besides, we don't know,
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:05.580]  if the joint that you smoke today,
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.140]  is it gonna have the same effect
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.180]  as if you do it tomorrow?
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.540]  Or is it gonna have the same effect on me as on you?
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.780]  We don't know that.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.140]  So those are really important, interesting questions.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.100]  Were the indicazative or hybrid data
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:21.180]  provided by the dispensaries where the products came from?
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.860]  Yes, this data was provided to Leafly
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.260]  from the dispensaries or from the people.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.340]  So yes, yeah, those were the names
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.060]  that the industry provided.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.460]  Does the biosynthetic pathway help explain
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.980]  the correlation of terpenes and cannabinoids?
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.620]  Tuxpanglir, I've seen Tuxpanglir before.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.700]  Yeah, I think so, right?
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.260]  Because they're using the same precursor molecule.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.780]  So, and then cannabinoids and terpenes
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.820]  at some point, they come from the same biochemical pathway,
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.740]  right, several steps above,
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.220]  they do come from the same biochemical pathway.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.540]  So yes, I do think that they do explain
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.740]  the correlation between terpenes and cannabinoids
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.060]  at some point, but there are multiple genes
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.460]  that are interacting, right?
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.500]  So, okay, what other, can you measure the amount
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.940]  of cannabinoids within the hires
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.020]  for industrial hemp production?
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.180]  That would be really interesting to do,
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.940]  to measure the amounts of industrial hemp.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.220]  However, because it is not required,
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.260]  then people do not do it, right?
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.860]  If you're growing it for fiber or for oil,
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.500]  you're just gonna measure THC to understand
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.220]  whether it's compliant with the law,
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.500]  but do you really care about the other terpenes?
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.300]  However, I do think that that would really complement
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.100]  the scientific story.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.340]  Anjali, Anjali, are the terpene synthase genes
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.780]  linked with the THC or CBDH genes
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.300]  when you show the PC analysis?
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.340]  So for that PC analysis,
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:53.340]  because we had so many high THC strains,
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.060]  we used those, right?
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.940]  Cause they were from dispensaries
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.140]  and people go to dispensaries for high THC mostly.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.780]  Thomas, are there any studies and collections
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.540]  completed in progress on American feral hemp?
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.180]  No, but we can start one, I think, or Zach.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.100]  There was one that came out like two days ago
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.380]  on Nebraska feral hemp.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:21.460]  You're right, you're right.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.460]  Yes, on Nebraska feral hemp.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.980]  So yeah, there are.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.500]  Do the number of cannabinoid genes
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.860]  affect the amount of cannabinoids
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.700]  that plant produces?
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.580]  So eight equals X and 32 equals first X.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.780]  We didn't find that.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.220]  We did find that there were some positive correlations
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.420]  between the number of copies
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.020]  and some negative correlations.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.180]  So we don't know for THC, for example,
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.620]  we found a positive correlation,
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.180]  but for CWD, we found a negative correlation.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.780]  So that's a good question.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.460]  Do you consider doing a PC analysis
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.780]  among phenotypes of flower
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.020]  and its correlation to cannabinoid quality and quantities
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.660]  since that genetic plays an important role
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.260]  in specific genes are expressed?
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.220]  Yes, but I don't know if a PC analysis
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.220]  would be the right way to do that.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.140]  I mean, I love PC analysis because they're so versatile,
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:09.700]  but anyway, I think I answered many of these questions.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.340]  I was curious, sorry, here we go.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.380]  I was fascinated by your statistically significant
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:23.660]  correlation between terpenes and cannabinoids,
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.620]  and that could be an example of a pleotropic
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.700]  or epistatic effect potentially.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.340]  Do you think that could also be explained
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.260]  by agricultural conditions?
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.220]  Second, healthy plants produce
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.580]  more secondary metabolites in general?
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.900]  That's a great question.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.460]  That's, I mean, that's a great question.
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.540]  I think that it could be, however,
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.700]  there are many terpenes that are produced
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.700]  when you are not in the best conditions
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.420]  where you're being eaten, right?
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:01.740]  So in certain conditions, you may not wanna produce,
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.980]  you're producing those terpenes
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.500]  because you're actually stressed, you know,
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.340]  like you're getting eaten by a worm,
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.140]  so you're producing those terpenes.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.700]  So I do think that, you know,
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:14.260]  like we know that light plays a crucial role
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.860]  in the production, at least of cannabinoids.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.020]  So perhaps when you have really good light,
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.380]  you produce more cannabinoids and therefore more terpenes.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:27.900]  We also know, again, I would like to know more
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.860]  about the genes related to trichomes, right?
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.540]  If you have bigger trichomes or more trichomes,
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:39.980]  are you also having more abundant cannabinoids and terpenes?
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:44.980]  But I do think that measuring those environmental effects
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.700]  and having a constant environment in order to do this,
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.340]  I think that that would be crucial.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.060]  That's a great question, I think.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.580]  Any work on a cannabis pan genome?
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.100]  Sorry?
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.380]  Do you know of any work on a cannabis pan genome?
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:07.020]  Well, that's what people are suggesting, right?
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.060]  That's where we're going, right?
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:14.020]  Again, I think it's important for academic institutions
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:19.020]  to be involved in that and to try to have students
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.780]  be involved with data collections.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.660]  But yeah, I think that that's a great way to do.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:29.550]  I think it's important to have these pan genomes, yeah.
[01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:34.630]  Well, thank you for saying a little extra.
[01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:37.870]  And, you know, I want to talk to you all day,
[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:41.030]  about this stuff, but we should probably let you go.
[01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:42.590]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:43.710]  I had a lot of fun.
[01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:45.750]  Thanks a lot.
