[00:00.640 --> 00:04.640]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.640 --> 00:15.600]  My name is Zachary Stansel and I am the hemp curator at the USDA Agricultural Research
[00:15.600 --> 00:16.600]  Service.
[00:16.600 --> 00:25.960]  So the work that we do in our laboratory is to create a seed library for genetically diverse
[00:25.960 --> 00:29.280]  hemp varieties from all around the world.
[00:30.280 --> 00:34.600]  Additionally, we are going to be studying all of those diverse and unique varieties
[00:34.600 --> 00:43.440]  of hemp for all kinds of different traits that plant breeders, farmers, and during the
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.040]  course of the last couple years that we've started this project, we've had just a tremendous
[00:48.040 --> 00:54.640]  honor of meeting, learning from, and collaborating with some of the most dynamic and influential
[00:54.640 --> 01:01.180]  scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts in the hemp world.
[01:01.180 --> 01:08.040]  So we are thrilled to share some of that knowledge that we've gained in that process with all
[01:08.040 --> 01:09.960]  of y'all.
[01:09.960 --> 01:17.960]  So I really want to thank Cornell University for co-partnering with us to make this hemp
[01:17.960 --> 01:20.960]  webinar series.
[01:20.960 --> 01:30.380]  And I want to give my biggest shout out to all of our friends at our HBCU institution.
[01:30.380 --> 01:39.960]  So we've been thrilled to see how these HBCU hemp programs are just emerging as real powerhouses.
[01:39.960 --> 01:47.880]  So we wanted to make sure that y'all were invited to the party and we're just so thrilled
[01:47.880 --> 01:50.120]  to have everyone here.
[01:50.280 --> 01:54.800]  So it's my great pleasure to introduce our speaker today.
[01:54.800 --> 02:01.760]  So Dr. Bruce Bugbee is a professor at Utah State University and the president of Apogee
[02:01.760 --> 02:03.540]  Instruments.
[02:03.540 --> 02:06.680]  So he has a very illustrious background.
[02:06.680 --> 02:12.440]  He's collaborated with NASA for 40 years to design food production systems for people
[02:12.440 --> 02:14.040]  living on Mars.
[02:14.960 --> 02:21.320]  In 2011, he was awarded the Governor's Medal for Science and is a fellow of both the American
[02:21.320 --> 02:27.160]  Society of Agronomy and American Society of Horticulture.
[02:27.160 --> 02:33.720]  He has recorded multiple videos on photo-biological principles.
[02:33.720 --> 02:41.000]  One video on cannabis has over 2 million views.
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.280]  So one might argue that his pinnacle achievement is summarizing so much of this information
[02:49.280 --> 02:54.360]  in a TED Talk called Turning Water into Food.
[02:54.360 --> 03:00.680]  So after Bruce's talk, we are going to have a Q&A session.
[03:00.680 --> 03:06.040]  So we'll start thinking of some great questions to stump him.
[03:06.080 --> 03:15.280]  I'm Bruce Bugbee and I'm pleased to be giving this talk today in the USDA Cornell Hemp Seminar
[03:15.280 --> 03:16.280]  on indoor production.
[03:16.280 --> 03:19.680]  Now you just heard previously on outdoor production.
[03:19.680 --> 03:21.620]  We're going to go indoors.
[03:21.620 --> 03:31.440]  The first thing I want to say is when we grow low THC compounds, the current value rarely
[03:31.440 --> 03:34.680]  justifies indoor production.
[03:35.440 --> 03:39.200]  There's a lot of other things that are high value that do justify it.
[03:39.200 --> 03:42.280]  And wheat, this is the core of our studies.
[03:42.280 --> 03:48.720]  And when we say hemp, in our case, we're always talking about medical hemp grown for the highest
[03:48.720 --> 03:52.280]  value direct consumption by people.
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.240]  So it can get pretty valuable.
[03:56.240 --> 03:59.040]  Let me start with a little diagram here.
[03:59.040 --> 04:02.200]  When we say indoor, what does that mean?
[04:02.520 --> 04:05.600]  To a lot of people, it means no sunlight.
[04:05.600 --> 04:10.760]  It means electric lights in a closed warehouse, in a closed room.
[04:10.760 --> 04:13.600]  And I'm going to put that over here.
[04:13.600 --> 04:15.120]  Here's our box.
[04:15.120 --> 04:21.000]  And I guess I could put some green plants in here too, inside the box.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.320]  And then since we're on a roll, here's the sun.
[04:25.320 --> 04:28.400]  Get the sun anatomically correct here.
[04:28.400 --> 04:30.280]  There's no sun in here.
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.320]  All of this is driven by electricity.
[04:32.320 --> 04:42.360]  It's very expensive to replicate sun compared to over here, a greenhouse.
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.160]  And now we put the sun in this.
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.880]  And of course, the sun goes right in, free sunlight.
[04:50.880 --> 04:53.360]  I've given several seminars on this.
[04:53.360 --> 04:58.280]  Most recently, one last October at Cornell University.
[04:58.280 --> 05:03.760]  And the title of that seminar was The Physics of Farming Without Sunlight.
[05:03.760 --> 05:04.760]  It's recorded.
[05:04.760 --> 05:06.160]  You can look that up online.
[05:06.160 --> 05:09.640]  It was part of the Horticulture Department seminar series.
[05:09.640 --> 05:17.400]  And I talked about this trade-off between farming without sunlight and greenhouses.
[05:17.400 --> 05:22.400]  And if you listen to my seminars, you'll know that I'm a huge proponent of greenhouses
[05:22.400 --> 05:24.680]  because we get free sunlight.
[05:24.680 --> 05:27.200]  This is high-tech greenhouses.
[05:27.200 --> 05:35.320]  So I should mention that these are closed, air-conditioned greenhouses in which we elevate
[05:35.320 --> 05:36.920]  CO2.
[05:36.920 --> 05:40.160]  So now, both of these have high CO2.
[05:40.160 --> 05:44.320]  They're life in the fast lane, really fast plant growth.
[05:44.320 --> 05:49.800]  It's just that this one uses free sunlight, and it uses a lot less fossil fuels.
[05:49.800 --> 05:55.120]  So the future of this, I think, is going to be high-tech greenhouses.
[05:55.120 --> 05:56.600]  Both are indoors and everything.
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.800]  I'm going to talk about is relevant to both.
[05:59.800 --> 06:06.080]  Both of them use supplemental lighting, especially in the winter, now from LEDs.
[06:06.080 --> 06:09.640]  This has the great advantage of some real high-tech glass.
[06:09.640 --> 06:10.640]  Not real high-tech.
[06:10.640 --> 06:12.000]  You buy it commercially.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.480]  But it reflects thermal infrared radiation from the sun.
[06:16.480 --> 06:22.760]  So it's much easier to air-condition greenhouses now than it used to be.
[06:22.920 --> 06:28.080]  And when they air-condition them, we control humidity and we can elevate CO2.
[06:28.080 --> 06:29.080]  So these are similar.
[06:29.080 --> 06:30.080]  All right.
[06:30.080 --> 06:31.320]  There's the whole talk.
[06:31.320 --> 06:33.020]  Indoor production, two things.
[06:33.020 --> 06:37.680]  But everything I say is relevant to both.
[06:37.680 --> 06:43.720]  Now let's take a look at what I call the nine cardinal parameters for growth.
[06:43.720 --> 06:49.380]  I've shown this slide several times, and other people have used it.
[06:49.380 --> 06:52.200]  So it's worth going through this again.
[06:52.640 --> 06:57.360]  When we go inside, we control all of these parameters.
[06:57.360 --> 07:04.160]  And of significance is CO2.
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.000]  We elevate CO2.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.880]  That enhances photosynthesis 30%, maybe even 40%.
[07:11.880 --> 07:17.120]  It allows us to use a higher temperature when we elevate CO2 because of photorespiration.
[07:17.280 --> 07:23.040]  It's a huge difference with indoor.
[07:23.040 --> 07:30.280]  Also we put light up here, control the light.
[07:30.280 --> 07:36.680]  Unlike outside, the sun comes up in the morning and we can't control whether it's cloudy or not.
[07:36.680 --> 07:40.320]  We can control when we plant, when we harvest.
[07:40.320 --> 07:43.900]  Indoors we have a huge control of light.
[07:43.900 --> 07:49.940]  With LEDs, and I'll talk about LEDs in a minute, we can turn up the LEDs and really
[07:49.940 --> 07:51.580]  increase the light.
[07:51.580 --> 07:55.180]  And wow, cannabis is an absolutely high light crop.
[07:55.180 --> 08:01.620]  It's like some race car that you can drive 400 miles an hour if you can pour enough light in.
[08:01.620 --> 08:07.100]  But when you put all that light in, the transpiration rate goes up.
[08:07.100 --> 08:09.260]  So you need more water.
[08:09.260 --> 08:12.100]  Need more water, you need more nutrients.
[08:12.100 --> 08:13.300]  Respiration in the root zone goes up.
[08:13.700 --> 08:15.660]  You need more oxygen.
[08:15.660 --> 08:17.460]  That optimum temperature is higher.
[08:17.460 --> 08:21.980]  You need more wind blowing through the crop to help cool it.
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.260]  Light drives everything.
[08:23.260 --> 08:25.140]  It's a huge factor.
[08:25.140 --> 08:30.080]  And in this lab, we spent a lot of time studying light.
[08:30.080 --> 08:38.300]  So that's a concept of all the things you can do with indoor production to elevate yield.
[08:38.300 --> 08:43.100]  Indoor production means our expensive inputs, particularly the light.
[08:43.100 --> 08:51.660]  But when the product is high value, all of this is economically justified.
[08:51.660 --> 08:59.980]  We have been studying in this lab medical hemp, which we also call low THC cannabis.
[08:59.980 --> 09:04.020]  It's all cannabis sativa, the same genus and species.
[09:04.020 --> 09:08.940]  The low THC is what's federally legal now.
[09:08.940 --> 09:14.260]  And that's the crop that we're studying at universities.
[09:14.260 --> 09:22.380]  That's in contrast to high THC cannabis that is psychoactive but federally illegal.
[09:22.380 --> 09:27.860]  So all of our licenses for low THC, when I say cannabis, I'm always referring to the
[09:27.860 --> 09:33.120]  low THC type, which has earned the nickname hemp.
[09:33.220 --> 09:37.400]  But hemp is often for rope and for clothes.
[09:37.400 --> 09:45.600]  So then we say medical hemp because this is grown for pharmaceuticals, not for seed and fiber.
[09:45.600 --> 09:54.640]  This is such a big thing that last year, we developed and taught an online course in the
[09:54.640 --> 09:59.960]  science and technology of medical cannabis cultivation.
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.640]  So capital C italicized, that's the name of the genus.
[10:04.640 --> 10:06.260]  This is the page.
[10:06.260 --> 10:10.400]  It's at cannabis.usu.edu.
[10:10.400 --> 10:13.540]  This course is, we got a lot of students.
[10:13.540 --> 10:15.420]  This course is now closed.
[10:15.420 --> 10:16.720]  It's done.
[10:16.720 --> 10:23.160]  But as we speak, we're working on a second edition to this course and it'll be posted here.
[10:23.160 --> 10:28.920]  But this website gives you a more in-depth view of some of the things I'm going to talk
[10:28.920 --> 10:31.760]  about here.
[10:31.760 --> 10:33.300]  Let's talk about LEDs.
[10:33.300 --> 10:38.960]  This is a real breakthrough and it's facilitated a massive amount of supplemental lighting
[10:38.960 --> 10:41.700]  for crops to push the growth.
[10:41.700 --> 10:49.920]  This is a curve over the last 20 years of LEDs and the electrical efficiency, it's gone
[10:49.920 --> 10:51.160]  from 10%.
[10:51.160 --> 10:55.240]  Here we are, 2022, right up here.
[10:55.240 --> 11:01.200]  Now, how does this compare for other lighting technologies?
[11:01.200 --> 11:07.200]  Before this, we used high pressure sodium, which is about 35% efficient.
[11:07.200 --> 11:13.360]  And you can see roughly 2010, LEDs caught up and passed high pressure sodium.
[11:13.360 --> 11:17.760]  And fluorescent is in the teens for efficiency down in here.
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.200]  So this gives you some sense of how good LEDs really are.
[11:22.200 --> 11:24.680]  But it also gives you a sense of where we're going.
[11:25.120 --> 11:26.920]  100% is a theoretical max.
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.840]  We're never going to quite get there, but this is our prediction.
[11:30.840 --> 11:36.200]  So we're close to where we're going to get with LEDs.
[11:36.200 --> 11:44.520]  What's changing about LEDs is price, reliability, those kinds of factors, the ability to get
[11:44.520 --> 11:48.480]  the lights consistently up to 80% efficient.
[11:48.480 --> 11:50.840]  This is just remarkable.
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.680]  Consider that this 20% here is still heat.
[11:56.680 --> 11:59.760]  People say LEDs don't put off any heat.
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.000]  If you're an instrument manufacturer, you put them in, they get plenty hot, even with
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.320]  20%.
[12:06.320 --> 12:08.600]  But they're a wonderful technology.
[12:08.600 --> 12:13.920]  They allow us to do all kinds of amazing things with colors of light.
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.320]  And I'm going to show you some of those things right now.
[12:17.320 --> 12:19.560]  Spectral effects on photosynthesis.
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.520]  I love this dark side of the moon prism breaking light up into colors.
[12:24.520 --> 12:31.720]  For the first time ever, we can pinpoint these colors and really study their effects on plants.
[12:31.720 --> 12:34.880]  It's fascinating what they can do.
[12:34.880 --> 12:42.000]  And our recent research in this lab has helped us see some things that we could not have
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.240]  studied without LEDs.
[12:46.240 --> 12:48.800]  Here's a big one.
[12:49.040 --> 12:52.640]  Far-red photons are these photons right here.
[12:52.640 --> 12:58.360]  I should draw that in red, deep red, the photons right here.
[12:58.360 --> 13:00.440]  They're right at the edge of our vision.
[13:00.440 --> 13:03.120]  Far-red photons are like a red-hot burner on a stove.
[13:03.120 --> 13:06.720]  Hard to read a book by them, but they're there.
[13:06.720 --> 13:08.480]  They're abundant in sunlight.
[13:08.480 --> 13:13.720]  And now we have a very, very efficient far-red LED.
[13:13.720 --> 13:18.360]  Historically, we have said those are not photosynthetic.
[13:18.360 --> 13:21.080]  They cause shade avoidance responses.
[13:21.080 --> 13:23.760]  They don't cause photosynthesis.
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.840]  We revisited that idea.
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.460]  We have been revisiting it over the past several years.
[13:31.460 --> 13:39.920]  And I'm pleased to report that we are proposing a new definition of photosynthetic photons.
[13:39.920 --> 13:47.920]  This work was the result of Shu-Yang Zhen, who was a postdoc with us for several years.
[13:48.480 --> 13:50.680]  Now she's assistant professor at Texas A&M.
[13:50.680 --> 13:52.560]  She's still working on this.
[13:52.560 --> 13:57.320]  And also Mark Van Iersel, who was a postdoc in this lab a long time ago.
[13:57.320 --> 13:59.240]  I forget, 20, 30 years ago.
[13:59.240 --> 14:03.640]  Now he's distinguished professor at the University of Georgia.
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.040]  We are still collaborating on this work.
[14:07.040 --> 14:13.920]  And to tell you how the circles that we go in, Shu-Yang got her PhD with Mark Van Iersel.
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.680]  And she came here to do photosynthesis research.
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.440]  Here's the paper that summarized all this.
[14:22.440 --> 14:30.560]  Just published last year, why far-red photons should be included in the definition of photosynthetic radiation.
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.900]  This is a review paper co-authored by all of us.
[14:35.900 --> 14:40.760]  This is pretty in-depth, but it's fascinating because I want to share the excitement of
[14:40.760 --> 14:42.300]  research with you.
[14:42.300 --> 14:47.240]  This is a huge finding for all of biology.
[14:47.240 --> 14:49.220]  Look at what these colors do.
[14:49.220 --> 14:50.460]  This is a leaf.
[14:50.460 --> 14:52.760]  And we'll put the leaf in green.
[14:52.760 --> 14:54.420]  On here, here's the bottom of the leaf.
[14:54.420 --> 14:55.940]  Here's the top.
[14:55.940 --> 15:00.500]  Blue and red photons are quickly absorbed in the top of the leaf.
[15:00.500 --> 15:04.020]  They're very efficiently absorbed, but they don't penetrate.
[15:04.020 --> 15:06.380]  They're so efficiently absorbed.
[15:06.380 --> 15:11.020]  Whereas the green photons penetrate deep into the leaf.
[15:11.340 --> 15:13.860]  When you get another leaf down here, they keep going.
[15:13.860 --> 15:16.340]  They keep penetrating into the canopy.
[15:16.340 --> 15:20.220]  So green photons, the value of green is underrated.
[15:20.220 --> 15:21.860]  Look at far-red.
[15:21.860 --> 15:24.460]  These also penetrate deep in the leaf.
[15:24.460 --> 15:29.340]  This is one of the reasons that these photons are so good.
[15:29.340 --> 15:32.900]  This, let's get rid of that.
[15:32.900 --> 15:36.580]  This is, there's two papers.
[15:36.580 --> 15:41.340]  You can pause this and see these papers, but two papers on the value of these far-red
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.500]  photons for photosynthesis.
[15:45.500 --> 15:47.060]  Far-red's almost like a blowtorch.
[15:47.060 --> 15:53.540]  It's a real powerful wavelength that we can now add and subtract when we do electric lights
[15:53.540 --> 15:56.580]  in greenhouses.
[15:56.580 --> 15:58.580]  Summary of spectral effects.
[15:58.580 --> 16:04.420]  I'm taking a dozen lectures and compressing them into minutes.
[16:04.420 --> 16:09.940]  This was helped out by Paul Kusuma, a recent PhD student in the lab.
[16:09.940 --> 16:16.180]  He's now a research scientist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
[16:16.180 --> 16:20.300]  But he helped us out a lot during his PhD year.
[16:20.300 --> 16:25.420]  Let's take these five categories of light and go through them.
[16:25.420 --> 16:30.860]  UV induces photoprotective pigments in plants.
[16:31.300 --> 16:37.500]  Some of those photoprotective pigments could be cannabinoids because they absorb UV light.
[16:37.500 --> 16:40.980]  UV light turns green lettuce red.
[16:40.980 --> 16:43.380]  That's anthocyanin.
[16:43.380 --> 16:51.660]  I will say that we don't have any evidence from multiple studies in this lab that more
[16:51.660 --> 16:58.180]  UV can trigger cannabinoid synthesis, even though people think that it does.
[16:58.220 --> 17:01.980]  Our results are now consistent with other labs on that.
[17:01.980 --> 17:06.860]  Blue inhibits cell expansion.
[17:06.860 --> 17:11.100]  If you want to keep plants small and short, you can do it with blue.
[17:11.100 --> 17:12.420]  I think I have a picture.
[17:12.420 --> 17:13.420]  Here's cannabis.
[17:13.420 --> 17:16.980]  30% blue, 5% blue.
[17:16.980 --> 17:18.340]  Look at that difference in height.
[17:18.340 --> 17:23.120]  You can shrink the plants, make them compact with blue light.
[17:23.120 --> 17:25.940]  When you do that, you have to plant at a higher density.
[17:26.100 --> 17:30.980]  These are all trade-offs with manipulating the shape.
[17:30.980 --> 17:36.660]  Green is key because it facilitates human vision.
[17:36.660 --> 17:39.460]  Here's some blue lights, blue and red.
[17:39.460 --> 17:41.060]  The plants look black.
[17:41.060 --> 17:46.780]  There's the green photons, beautiful plants, example of how critical green light is.
[17:46.780 --> 17:50.740]  We used to grow plants under purple light, blue and red.
[17:50.740 --> 17:58.300]  Now that's so difficult that we now add white LEDs to fixtures so we can see the plants.
[17:58.300 --> 18:00.680]  I think I have another picture here.
[18:00.680 --> 18:06.940]  This is cannabis under a high-pressure sodium light and under some LEDs.
[18:06.940 --> 18:09.060]  You can see the difference in color here.
[18:09.060 --> 18:11.540]  These just look more natural.
[18:11.540 --> 18:14.020]  The growth was the same.
[18:14.020 --> 18:16.300]  It didn't matter.
[18:16.300 --> 18:21.100]  In this study, we got some spider mites, a microscopic insect.
[18:21.100 --> 18:28.260]  We couldn't see those on the high-pressure sodium lights, but here in the LEDs with a
[18:28.260 --> 18:33.280]  better color rendering index, we could find the insects.
[18:33.280 --> 18:37.460]  We can also diagnose nutritional disorders.
[18:37.460 --> 18:45.220]  The bottom line is green photons are huge for helping people see disorders and microscopic
[18:45.220 --> 18:48.300]  insects in plants.
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.780]  Manufacturers are starting to put information now in their fixtures, but the color rendering
[18:52.780 --> 18:56.780]  index, this is obviously huge for people.
[18:56.780 --> 18:59.500]  For years, we've said, oh, it just doesn't matter for plants.
[18:59.500 --> 19:01.220]  Yeah, it does.
[19:01.220 --> 19:07.900]  I love the Chinese saying, the best fertilizer is the footsteps of the farmer.
[19:07.900 --> 19:12.360]  If you can't see the plants, your footsteps don't help much.
[19:12.360 --> 19:17.600]  Red photons are the meat and potatoes of the diet, the potatoes of the diet.
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.120]  They're very efficient for photosynthesis.
[19:20.120 --> 19:22.300]  The red LEDs are efficient.
[19:22.300 --> 19:29.920]  Many of our fixtures now are 80% to 90% red LEDs, both because they're electrically efficient
[19:29.920 --> 19:33.480]  and quickly absorbed by the plants.
[19:33.480 --> 19:38.380]  And then far-red photons, which are photosynthetic, do the opposite of blue.
[19:38.380 --> 19:39.380]  These inhibit.
[19:39.380 --> 19:40.760]  These enhance.
[19:40.760 --> 19:47.240]  We can play with those two colors of light to shape plants, tall, short, fat, thin, wide.
[19:47.240 --> 19:54.840]  It's a wonderful time to be doing research on this to optimize colors and plant shape.
[19:54.840 --> 19:58.500]  Now we want to switch to amount of light.
[19:58.500 --> 20:02.480]  This is an amazing story with cannabis.
[20:02.480 --> 20:08.680]  No other crop benefits from the high light the way cannabis does.
[20:08.800 --> 20:12.800]  What this graph shows you is daily light integral.
[20:12.800 --> 20:19.120]  This is the amount of light per day and yield up here.
[20:19.120 --> 20:24.440]  Other crops would look like that.
[20:24.440 --> 20:29.000]  They would saturate at a much lower level of light.
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.640]  Cannabis keeps growing.
[20:30.640 --> 20:32.520]  We've done this many times.
[20:32.520 --> 20:37.840]  This requires rooms with whole communities of plants to do this.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.560]  But our data, coupled now with that of some other labs, indicate we can push cannabis
[20:43.560 --> 20:46.040]  hard with high light.
[20:46.040 --> 20:49.780]  Let me give you a sense of how high this is.
[20:49.780 --> 20:58.880]  On the brightest days in the summer, sunny days, no clouds, we can get up to 60 right
[20:58.880 --> 21:00.260]  here.
[21:00.260 --> 21:04.360]  So we've exceeded a full sunny day in the summer.
[21:04.360 --> 21:07.320]  And this is near the summer solstice.
[21:07.800 --> 21:11.760]  The average in the field is more like 40 or 50.
[21:11.760 --> 21:16.960]  This would be a field average in full sunlight, somewhere down here, especially toward the
[21:16.960 --> 21:19.080]  end of the year.
[21:19.080 --> 21:26.200]  In a greenhouse that blocks half of the light, the average is down here.
[21:26.200 --> 21:31.580]  I'm going to put green GH greenhouse, which is about 30.
[21:31.580 --> 21:36.360]  And that's with no supplemental light, but grown in the summer.
[21:36.400 --> 21:43.160]  And of course, in the winter, we're down here, indoors, less than 10.
[21:43.160 --> 21:51.280]  Moral of the story, wow, here is a crop we can push with high light and push hard.
[21:51.280 --> 21:56.360]  Interestingly enough, in this data, let's erase those lines.
[21:56.360 --> 22:01.840]  In this data, we measured harvest index.
[22:01.840 --> 22:08.560]  Now, this is the ratio of flower yield to total biomass.
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.920]  As the light went up, harvest index also went up.
[22:12.920 --> 22:13.920]  Guess what?
[22:13.920 --> 22:21.640]  In our major crop plants, corn, soybeans, well, not so much soybeans, but high yielding
[22:21.640 --> 22:28.240]  crops, corn, the harvest index is down in here, in this zone.
[22:28.240 --> 22:30.600]  So cannabis is quite remarkable.
[22:30.640 --> 22:37.400]  A real high ratio of flowers to total weight, and that went up with light.
[22:37.400 --> 22:39.800]  Here's what the plants look like at low light.
[22:39.800 --> 22:42.760]  Not surprisingly spindly, small flowers.
[22:42.760 --> 22:43.760]  We increase the light.
[22:43.760 --> 22:49.760]  Boy, these were just short and compact and huge colas on these plants once we get up
[22:49.760 --> 22:51.240]  to 70.
[22:51.240 --> 22:58.880]  This is work done by Mitch Westmoreland, who is a current PhD student in the lab.
[22:58.880 --> 23:06.160]  If you are measuring lights, a daily light integral, the total photons in the day of
[23:06.160 --> 23:16.360]  70 would be 1,600 micromoles per meter squared per second at a 12-hour photo period.
[23:16.360 --> 23:22.440]  This number right here, we call the PPFD, photosynthetic photon flux density.
[23:22.440 --> 23:23.800]  This is what we measure.
[23:23.800 --> 23:25.360]  That's amazing.
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.760]  That's 80% of full sunlight the whole time when these plants are in here.
[23:30.760 --> 23:31.840]  This is just stunning.
[23:31.840 --> 23:36.080]  No other crop is like this, at least none that we have studied.
[23:36.080 --> 23:40.400]  Now I will say this is with high CO2.
[23:40.400 --> 23:46.280]  All of our work is done with high CO2 because it's immediately economically feasible and
[23:46.280 --> 23:53.360]  important to elevate the CO2, so that is not limiting in here.
[23:53.360 --> 23:56.920]  What did this do to quality when we push the plants this hard?
[23:56.920 --> 23:59.400]  You might think the quality would go down.
[23:59.400 --> 24:01.080]  It did not.
[24:01.080 --> 24:02.320]  Yield went up.
[24:02.320 --> 24:10.920]  Here is CBD, 15% flat line over this whole DLI up to 70.
[24:10.920 --> 24:12.360]  Didn't go up, didn't go down.
[24:12.360 --> 24:13.880]  Stayed the same.
[24:13.880 --> 24:18.840]  Here's THC, also a flat line, very slightly up.
[24:18.840 --> 24:28.880]  Now if you're an astute watcher, what's the US legal limit for hemp for low THC?
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.080]  0.03%.
[24:33.080 --> 24:36.000]  There's the legal limit right there.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.040]  These plants exceed the legal limit.
[24:38.040 --> 24:40.160]  We're pushing them hard.
[24:40.160 --> 24:41.560]  We do not sell hemp.
[24:41.560 --> 24:48.400]  We destroy all the hemp and so our license lets us get up to above 0.3.
[24:48.960 --> 24:56.360]  Of course, you got to be real careful not to exceed 0.3 for a medical hemp.
[24:56.360 --> 25:01.120]  This is an example of what happens when we push the lights hard.
[25:01.120 --> 25:05.520]  CBG is the precursor to both of these.
[25:05.520 --> 25:10.960]  If I do arrows on here, this is the precursor to both of these.
[25:10.960 --> 25:12.720]  Wow, look at that.
[25:12.720 --> 25:17.320]  It increased like 40% with high light.
[25:17.320 --> 25:20.480]  These plants are making a lot of cannabinoids.
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.360]  This is the ratio, CBD to THC, which we pay attention to a lot.
[25:25.360 --> 25:28.000]  We want the THC to be low so it's legal.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.160]  We want the CBD to be high.
[25:30.160 --> 25:34.560]  Lots of people make all kinds of claims about this ratio, but this line is really pretty
[25:34.560 --> 25:42.440]  flat and right at about 25 to 1, CBD to THC.
[25:42.440 --> 25:44.520]  Here's what the flowers look like.
[25:44.560 --> 25:50.800]  Boy, dense colas at high light and at low light, pretty spindly colas.
[25:52.680 --> 25:57.080]  Yeah, it looks like I'm at 25 minutes.
[25:58.880 --> 26:05.640]  Let's take a look at a couple other amazing things that are relevant to the field.
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.720]  We have been doing a series of studies on degree days in cannabis.
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.640]  We use degree days in lots of horticultural crops.
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.320]  It's just the temperature multiplied by the number of days.
[26:20.320 --> 26:22.640]  One hot day is equal to two cold days.
[26:22.640 --> 26:23.720]  That's the concept.
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.600]  We take temperature times time and we call it degree days.
[26:28.600 --> 26:35.280]  That concept predicts the rate of development, time to flowering in a lot of our horticultural
[26:35.280 --> 26:36.720]  crops.
[26:36.720 --> 26:39.000]  What does it do in cannabis?
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.920]  We recently completed a study.
[26:40.920 --> 26:43.480]  When I say we, this means Mitch Westmoreland.
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.280]  He did the work.
[26:47.280 --> 26:50.680]  Wildly different temperatures, really pretty warm down to really cold.
[26:50.680 --> 26:52.480]  These are in Celsius.
[26:52.480 --> 27:00.040]  This is in the 80s and down into the 50s in Fahrenheit, a huge range of temperatures.
[27:00.040 --> 27:03.040]  All the data fit one curve.
[27:03.160 --> 27:11.040]  The rate of development, meaning flower mass, is on a steady curve predicted by thermal
[27:11.040 --> 27:14.240]  time, also called degree days.
[27:14.240 --> 27:21.360]  This is quite remarkable that regardless of the extremes of temperature, if we add up
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.560]  degree days, we can predict rate of development of a crop.
[27:26.560 --> 27:31.520]  This by the way was all done at a 12-hour photo period.
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.160]  This is going to interact with photo period too, but in a controlled environment, we can
[27:36.160 --> 27:42.380]  set the photo period at 12 hours.
[27:42.380 --> 27:45.860]  Phosphorus, this is huge.
[27:45.860 --> 27:53.180]  Cannabis growers are famous for over fertilizing with phosphorus.
[27:53.180 --> 28:02.260]  For those of us studying nutrition at universities, we have long encouraged field growers to put
[28:02.340 --> 28:10.700]  on less phosphorus because it's a horrible environmental pollutant.
[28:10.700 --> 28:14.540]  Universally people put on more phosphorus than they need.
[28:14.540 --> 28:18.780]  Runoff causes it to end up in lakes and rivers and algal blooms.
[28:18.780 --> 28:20.380]  It's a bad story.
[28:20.380 --> 28:22.860]  Now we bring in cannabis growers.
[28:22.860 --> 28:30.020]  We have seen cannabis growers put an order of magnitude more phosphorus on cannabis than
[28:30.020 --> 28:33.380]  you would for any other crop.
[28:33.380 --> 28:37.420]  We started studying this, many series of studies.
[28:37.420 --> 28:46.280]  This is in liquid fertilizer now, not in a field rate, but most of our crops in here
[28:46.280 --> 28:51.100]  are grown with phosphorus in this range.
[28:51.100 --> 28:56.720]  I'm going to put optimal here.
[28:56.720 --> 29:00.560]  This includes dozens and dozens of crops.
[29:00.560 --> 29:02.220]  Down in here is optimal.
[29:02.220 --> 29:09.480]  We have found cannabis does indeed respond to more phosphorus, but only from about 15
[29:09.480 --> 29:14.320]  ppm to 30.
[29:14.320 --> 29:22.320]  Now we don't have data down here, but 30 ppm is beneficial to phosphorus.
[29:22.320 --> 29:25.320]  Going higher than that had no value.
[29:25.320 --> 29:28.160]  This is a non-significant slope of the line.
[29:28.160 --> 29:33.600]  It looks like it slopes down, but it's really statistically flat.
[29:33.600 --> 29:40.000]  We have not seen a value of these incredibly high phosphorus levels.
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.020]  And really we're waiting for people to announce, the growers to announce that they grow sustainable
[29:45.020 --> 29:51.880]  phosphorus, sustainable cannabis, not over fertilized with phosphorus.
[29:51.880 --> 30:01.800]  This is tricky business though, because there are some cultivars that appear to have benefit
[30:01.800 --> 30:04.120]  from higher phosphorus.
[30:04.120 --> 30:07.060]  It's not the norm, but there are some cultivars.
[30:07.060 --> 30:11.080]  And in those cultivars, let me see, let's put that in red.
[30:11.080 --> 30:18.200]  This line slopes slightly up, but the majority are a flat line.
[30:18.200 --> 30:20.840]  We're still studying this.
[30:20.840 --> 30:28.080]  Let me show you what we know, since I've got a minute here to show you.
[30:28.080 --> 30:30.520]  Here's a plant.
[30:30.520 --> 30:32.160]  Let's see, we're going to make this simple.
[30:32.160 --> 30:37.080]  We're going to put one leaf up here, and then we're going to have the flower bud right here.
[30:37.080 --> 30:39.880]  Very simple plant.
[30:39.880 --> 30:49.680]  In the later stages of development, phosphorus, shown here in red, moves out of the leaves
[30:49.680 --> 30:52.360]  into the flower.
[30:52.360 --> 30:58.720]  Even though there's ample P in here, when we track this over time, the flowers are cannibalizing
[30:58.720 --> 31:00.560]  the leaves for phosphorus.
[31:00.560 --> 31:05.840]  And you think, well, okay, if the flower needs a lot of phosphorus, this is a good thing.
[31:05.840 --> 31:13.040]  But these levels in the leaves get to be 1% phosphorus or more, way more than could ever
[31:13.040 --> 31:14.240]  be used.
[31:14.240 --> 31:22.120]  The optimum in the leaves is about 0.3%, and the leaves are doing all the work.
[31:22.120 --> 31:26.240]  They're full of enzymes, they're full of nucleic acids.
[31:26.240 --> 31:28.480]  They need a lot of phosphorus.
[31:28.480 --> 31:37.520]  The flowers shouldn't need any more than 0.3%, but they accumulate massive amounts of phosphorus.
[31:37.520 --> 31:45.800]  We think what's happening is plants that grow seeds supply their seeds with very high
[31:45.800 --> 31:48.760]  phosphorus to give them a good start in life.
[31:48.760 --> 31:53.200]  The seeds are packed with phosphorus, so they germinate and they have adequate phosphorus
[31:53.200 --> 31:55.400]  when they're a young seedling.
[31:55.400 --> 32:02.960]  Here we go with cannabis, feminized plants, no seeds, the plant still panics and moves
[32:02.960 --> 32:05.360]  phosphorus into this flower.
[32:05.360 --> 32:12.280]  And it's useless phosphorus, but if it's cannibalizing the leaves, it reduces yield.
[32:12.280 --> 32:16.040]  But these super high levels are not beneficial.
[32:16.040 --> 32:22.360]  And here's the amount of P. You give them an optimal level and there's minimal leaching
[32:22.360 --> 32:31.680]  and tremendous leaching, both from the field and from indoor cultivation from this.
[32:31.680 --> 32:38.080]  I think if we extrapolate to the field from this, I think we could roughly put pounds
[32:38.080 --> 32:39.560]  per acre.
[32:39.560 --> 32:44.160]  If you're listening in the United States and you're still using our ancient units of pounds
[32:44.160 --> 32:50.280]  and acres, this is roughly similar to kilograms per hectare.
[32:50.280 --> 32:55.480]  Don't over fertilize with phosphorus, please.
[32:55.480 --> 33:01.440]  One final topic, silicon, Si.
[33:02.200 --> 33:07.240]  Not an essential element, but generally abundant in field soils.
[33:07.240 --> 33:14.000]  Now we go to a greenhouse and we are in a container.
[33:14.000 --> 33:19.680]  Rockwool, peat based media, coconut coir, perlite, a lot of things.
[33:19.680 --> 33:24.520]  None of them have adequate silica for the plants.
[33:24.520 --> 33:28.400]  And as a rule of thumb, silicon dioxide is glass.
[33:28.400 --> 33:35.880]  So soluble silica goes into the plants and really strengthens cell walls.
[33:35.880 --> 33:39.320]  We know this from many years of study.
[33:39.320 --> 33:43.860]  One of the huge things it does is disease resistance.
[33:43.860 --> 33:50.600]  You can almost eliminate powdery mildew with ample silica in the root zone.
[33:50.600 --> 33:53.000]  We've seen it multiple times.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.680]  Growers had an outbreak of powdery mildew and you say, what's going on?
[33:56.680 --> 34:02.520]  Well, it turns out their silicon injector broke and it stopped and the disease came back.
[34:02.520 --> 34:09.880]  It helps with, we got biotic stress, abiotic stress, helps make the plants more tolerant
[34:09.880 --> 34:14.240]  of certain insects, mitigates heavy metal toxicity.
[34:14.240 --> 34:15.520]  We're always worried about that.
[34:15.520 --> 34:19.800]  We want the medical hemp to be clean, clean, clean.
[34:19.800 --> 34:22.040]  Silica helps with that.
[34:22.040 --> 34:23.040]  Stress tolerance.
[34:23.040 --> 34:24.760]  Now, let me show you an amazing picture.
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.720]  This is from Jonathan France, who is a PhD student in this lab.
[34:29.720 --> 34:31.680]  Some years ago, this is the reference.
[34:31.680 --> 34:34.400]  You can pause on this.
[34:34.400 --> 34:35.500]  Boom.
[34:35.500 --> 34:38.280]  This happens to be with Zinnia.
[34:38.280 --> 34:43.360]  I don't have a picture with this with cannabis, but cannabis got a lot of trichomes.
[34:43.360 --> 34:44.360]  Look at this.
[34:44.360 --> 34:47.680]  Silica, this thing is like a rhinoceros.
[34:47.680 --> 34:51.400]  Without silica, it's susceptible to disease and insects.
[34:52.400 --> 34:59.880]  When we grow in a soilless media, we want to be adding silica to that media to help
[34:59.880 --> 35:04.000]  the plants be rugged like they are in the field.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.480]  Now, remember where the cannabinoids are?
[35:08.480 --> 35:14.680]  If I do a little picture here, they're in trichomes.
[35:14.680 --> 35:17.400]  What are those trichomes made out of?
[35:17.400 --> 35:19.280]  Silica.
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.040]  Cannabis in particular benefits from ample silica in the root zone.
[35:25.040 --> 35:31.040]  The trichomes get tougher as well.
[35:31.040 --> 35:32.040]  Silica is hard to add.
[35:32.040 --> 35:34.400]  It's not very soluble.
[35:34.400 --> 35:41.960]  We recently have a paper on how to get it in liquid fertilizer systems with an injector
[35:41.960 --> 35:45.520]  so you can put it in liquid fertilizer.
[35:45.520 --> 35:53.280]  We have found, building on the work of other laboratories, that wollastonite, a natural
[35:53.280 --> 35:57.600]  mineral, is a tremendous source of silica.
[35:57.600 --> 35:58.960]  Just ground wollastonite.
[35:58.960 --> 36:01.300]  Here's the mineral, grind it up.
[36:01.300 --> 36:03.920]  It's calcium silicate.
[36:03.920 --> 36:09.280]  This goes into solution as calcium, and this is silicic acid.
[36:09.280 --> 36:15.200]  This is bioavailable silica, and wollastonite is slow release.
[36:15.880 --> 36:16.880]  Look at this.
[36:16.880 --> 36:18.760]  Peat, perlite, coconut coir, vermiculite.
[36:18.760 --> 36:19.760]  Hardly any silica.
[36:19.760 --> 36:22.600]  Down here, there's wollastonite.
[36:22.600 --> 36:24.440]  This is VanCell W10.
[36:24.440 --> 36:33.520]  This is a brand name of an American wollastonite mined in New York.
[36:33.520 --> 36:37.120]  It's sold for horticulture uses like this.
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.600]  This is, look at it, 160 days it was still releasing silica.
[36:41.600 --> 36:44.200]  This is a wonderful product.
[36:44.200 --> 36:54.560]  We put it in our media at, actually the brand name we use is VanCell 10.
[36:54.560 --> 37:00.080]  We put it in our media at one gram per liter.
[37:00.080 --> 37:09.200]  I know that's metric units, but you can convert to whatever other numbers you want.
[37:09.200 --> 37:12.480]  There's the low rate here.
[37:12.480 --> 37:14.920]  One final slide.
[37:14.920 --> 37:16.400]  This is our campus.
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.160]  Cornell, I was there again last fall, is a beautiful campus.
[37:21.160 --> 37:22.160]  So are we.
[37:22.160 --> 37:25.520]  This is, there's the Wellsville Mountains right here.
[37:25.520 --> 37:30.800]  My house is right over in here in this picture.
[37:30.800 --> 37:37.620]  If you're interested in cannabis, I invite you to come here to graduate school.
[37:37.620 --> 37:41.320]  We love collaborating with people.
[37:41.320 --> 37:45.880]  This is a fascinating crop with an exciting future.
[37:45.880 --> 37:52.800]  In some ways, we're using controlled environments to predict plant responses to the environment.
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.240]  We're using cannabis as a model crop for this.
[37:57.240 --> 37:58.920]  Thanks for listening.
[37:58.920 --> 38:03.720]  Now I'll look forward to your questions.
[38:03.720 --> 38:10.720]  I can think, I believe I can speak for everyone that Dr. Bugbee always gives a mind blowing
[38:10.720 --> 38:11.720]  presentation.
[38:11.720 --> 38:16.220]  And today was no different whatsoever.
[38:16.220 --> 38:18.320]  So thank you for that.
[38:18.320 --> 38:24.120]  That got my creativity and curiosity going on so many different levels.
[38:24.120 --> 38:28.240]  So I see a ton of questions in the chat.
[38:28.240 --> 38:34.960]  I think George and Tony are going to try to field those to Bruce.
[38:34.960 --> 38:37.680]  And by the way, we should be back live, right?
[38:37.680 --> 38:42.240]  Yep, I can hear you loud and clear.
[38:42.240 --> 38:43.240]  Yep.
[38:43.240 --> 38:44.240]  All right.
[38:44.240 --> 38:47.520]  So our first question is from Angela Goodwin.
[38:47.520 --> 38:51.240]  She asked, what is the definition of medical hemp versus hemp?
[38:51.240 --> 38:58.220]  Does the term involve the proposed use such as CBD oil?
[38:59.200 --> 39:04.920]  This is more of a economic distinction than a botanical distinction.
[39:04.920 --> 39:13.580]  But historically, when we've said hemp, we mean growing it for rope and well, mostly
[39:13.580 --> 39:15.660]  growing it for rope.
[39:15.660 --> 39:23.060]  If you look in the literature, there's ads by the federal government, the Navy needs
[39:23.060 --> 39:26.700]  the rope, grow hemp to make hemp for the Navy.
[39:26.700 --> 39:29.420]  This was like before World War II.
[39:29.420 --> 39:33.420]  And it was a huge campaign to grow a lot of hemp nationwide.
[39:33.420 --> 39:38.300]  Because the fibers, cotton fibers are like three inches long, hemp fibers are like, they
[39:38.300 --> 39:39.580]  can be three feet long.
[39:39.580 --> 39:43.420]  I mean, that's why it makes such rugged clothing and rugged material.
[39:43.420 --> 39:47.020]  Honestly, I think hemp has a huge future.
[39:47.020 --> 39:53.020]  And I think we're going to see hemp gradually start to replace cotton for clothes.
[39:53.020 --> 39:54.540]  Has deeper roots than cotton.
[39:54.540 --> 39:57.020]  I think it can be more water use efficient.
[39:57.020 --> 39:58.740]  That's another matter.
[39:58.740 --> 40:02.780]  But when we say hemp, we think of rope, historically.
[40:02.780 --> 40:08.860]  So then we start calling it medical hemp, which got that started to be illegal before
[40:08.860 --> 40:10.780]  World War II.
[40:10.780 --> 40:12.180]  And everything shut down.
[40:12.180 --> 40:15.620]  And we went through decades of this is terrible stuff.
[40:15.620 --> 40:16.700]  Nobody should be growing it.
[40:16.700 --> 40:22.120]  Well, and guess what, we got DuPont polyester, we didn't need hemp for rope so much anymore.
[40:22.200 --> 40:27.800]  But the distinction, then we say medical hemp because of its end use.
[40:27.800 --> 40:34.000]  It's not botanical, it's the end use for CBD and other cannabinoid products.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.920]  Botanically, again, they're both cannabis, sativa.
[40:37.920 --> 40:44.520]  We have lines and Cornell is a leader in studying this, that really make good fiber, that'll
[40:44.520 --> 40:45.520]  make good clothes.
[40:45.520 --> 40:49.400]  God, we're putting it in concrete now instead of rebar.
[40:49.400 --> 40:51.480]  Imagine, what a wonderful time.
[40:51.840 --> 40:54.840]  Botanical products to build houses.
[40:54.840 --> 41:00.120]  That's all hemp with the historical term.
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.280]  When we say medical, that means we're going to use it for pharmaceuticals.
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.320]  And we are breeding programs head in a different direction.
[41:07.320 --> 41:09.600]  We don't care if it makes fiber anymore.
[41:09.600 --> 41:15.940]  We want to focus on the medical part of it.
[41:15.940 --> 41:18.820]  I have to look to the side because that's where I got the screen.
[41:19.140 --> 41:23.180]  All right, we have a question from Ana Maria.
[41:23.180 --> 41:29.580]  Have you studied the effect of far red light on cannabinoid production and or flower size?
[41:29.580 --> 41:32.140]  Yes, we have.
[41:32.140 --> 41:37.020]  And I talked a lot about far red light in photosynthesis.
[41:37.020 --> 41:40.460]  But I also said it's like a blowtorch.
[41:40.460 --> 41:46.060]  When you take a plant science course, and especially maybe a plant physiology course,
[41:46.060 --> 41:52.340]  you learn that far red light is very enriched in shade underneath the tree.
[41:52.340 --> 41:54.900]  And what happens to plants when they grow in the shade?
[41:54.900 --> 41:56.340]  I can draw it right here.
[41:56.340 --> 41:58.980]  Let's see if I've got my screen.
[41:58.980 --> 42:00.660]  Here's a tree.
[42:00.660 --> 42:02.100]  Here's the shade.
[42:02.100 --> 42:07.900]  These plants get tall fast because of enriched far red light.
[42:07.900 --> 42:10.860]  So now experimentally, we give them more far red.
[42:10.860 --> 42:13.140]  And most plants panic.
[42:13.140 --> 42:16.100]  They think they're in the shade, and they get real tall.
[42:16.100 --> 42:19.340]  And that's almost always a bad thing.
[42:19.340 --> 42:25.580]  We can give far red light to lettuce, and it just keeps getting bigger horizontally.
[42:25.580 --> 42:29.500]  So we have to use far red light very carefully.
[42:29.500 --> 42:33.180]  It doesn't have a direct effect on cannabinoids.
[42:33.180 --> 42:36.620]  It has mostly effect on plant shape.
[42:36.620 --> 42:42.060]  And so what we'd like to do is have a nice, compact plant over here.
[42:42.060 --> 42:46.820]  And we have to be careful not to use too much far red and get the plants too tall.
[42:46.820 --> 42:50.580]  All righty.
[42:50.580 --> 42:53.340]  Our next question is from Felix Aikens.
[42:53.340 --> 42:58.180]  What is your experience with photo damage or photo inhibition in cannabis?
[42:58.180 --> 43:06.500]  I'll make my line slightly smaller here.
[43:06.500 --> 43:13.340]  Cannabis has less photo inhibition than many other crops, which is why we could do that.
[43:13.580 --> 43:20.420]  And you can see here how I had that graph, and the amount of light is here, and the yield is like this.
[43:20.420 --> 43:25.180]  This is the danger zone up here where we get so much light, it's too much.
[43:25.180 --> 43:28.740]  And it starts burning leaves, and it causes a problem.
[43:28.740 --> 43:37.540]  But cannabis apparently has sufficient photoprotective pigments that we can push it hard with light
[43:37.540 --> 43:40.580]  and get higher yields.
[43:40.580 --> 43:48.780]  Keep in mind now that this is under electric lights, which we don't give them very much UV light.
[43:48.780 --> 43:51.820]  In the sun, they get a lot of UV.
[43:51.820 --> 44:00.380]  The sunlight has something like 8% UV.
[44:00.380 --> 44:02.700]  And electrically, we can just take that out.
[44:02.700 --> 44:04.580]  We just don't get many UV.
[44:04.580 --> 44:08.940]  So all of a sudden, it could be damaging in sunlight to go this high.
[44:08.940 --> 44:15.820]  But if we give them the equivalent of sunlight without the UV, we can push them harder.
[44:15.820 --> 44:25.500]  It's a big topic, because there was an early paper by Leiden, L-Y-D-O-N, Leiden et al.
[44:25.500 --> 44:34.140]  And it was 40 years ago, but they studied high UV and cannabinoids.
[44:34.140 --> 44:38.020]  And they were only doing leaves, and they got really low levels.
[44:38.100 --> 44:44.180]  But in one of their lines, high UV increased cannabinoid production.
[44:44.180 --> 44:47.220]  But in the other line, it didn't do anything.
[44:47.220 --> 44:54.700]  So they concluded in their paper, the effect of UV on cannabinoids is not certain.
[44:54.700 --> 44:58.180]  But everybody says, well, the Leiden paper proved it helps.
[44:58.180 --> 45:03.020]  So there's a case of you got to read the paper to have good scholarship.
[45:04.020 --> 45:05.020]  All right.
[45:05.020 --> 45:07.940]  This is a kind of related question from Erica Hernandez.
[45:07.940 --> 45:12.420]  Has a saturation point been found for PPFD versus growth?
[45:12.420 --> 45:16.380]  What is required to determine the point of diminishing returns monetarily
[45:16.380 --> 45:23.660]  for added supplemental or sole light source?
[45:23.660 --> 45:26.860]  So I guess I can draw that graph again.
[45:26.860 --> 45:28.860]  Here's increasing light.
[45:28.900 --> 45:34.100]  But now we could put a dollar sign here for the cost of that light
[45:34.100 --> 45:36.580]  if we're doing it with supplemental.
[45:36.580 --> 45:39.980]  And we can put a dollar sign over here for yield.
[45:39.980 --> 45:47.020]  And clearly, this line, if it was exactly like that, wouldn't matter.
[45:47.020 --> 45:48.820]  But it's not exactly like that.
[45:48.820 --> 45:51.380]  It starts here, and it goes like this.
[45:51.380 --> 45:57.500]  So the economic optimum is really something more like that.
[45:57.540 --> 45:59.940]  That's a curved line.
[45:59.940 --> 46:05.780]  And economically, some point in the middle is an economic optimum.
[46:05.780 --> 46:08.940]  Again, because here you got to pay the electric bill.
[46:08.940 --> 46:16.860]  And in the sun, we get up in this part of the curve for free in the summer.
[46:16.860 --> 46:20.820]  This is part of the reason cannabis is just such a vigorous plant.
[46:20.820 --> 46:23.100]  It just grows enormously.
[46:23.100 --> 46:27.740]  It grows big in the field.
[46:27.740 --> 46:28.220]  All righty.
[46:28.220 --> 46:34.780]  A couple of people asked about what concentration do you think is high CO2?
[46:34.780 --> 46:39.900]  Do you start the CO2 high, or do you increase it as the plants get larger?
[46:39.900 --> 46:40.380]  Yeah.
[46:40.380 --> 46:45.820]  Well, if you ever take a class from me, you know I'm constantly drawing xy plots.
[46:45.820 --> 46:47.540]  So now we do the same thing.
[46:47.540 --> 46:49.220]  Here's CO2.
[46:49.220 --> 46:55.940]  That's a C. Here's 400, which is what we get for free outside.
[46:55.940 --> 46:58.980]  And let's go all the way up here to 2,000.
[46:58.980 --> 47:02.820]  Now, these units are parts per million.
[47:02.820 --> 47:07.300]  So way high, five times higher than the field.
[47:07.300 --> 47:08.820]  And here's photosynthesis.
[47:08.820 --> 47:11.220]  P net we'll put right here.
[47:11.220 --> 47:16.340]  So there's some point in here where it gets to zero.
[47:16.340 --> 47:21.580]  And then this curve looks like that.
[47:21.580 --> 47:32.420]  And right about here, in fact, this curve is probably something like this.
[47:32.420 --> 47:37.340]  1,200 is pretty much the saturation point.
[47:37.340 --> 47:41.180]  This depends a little bit on temperature.
[47:41.180 --> 47:46.100]  But enriching from 400 to 1,200, look, I've roughly drawn this.
[47:46.100 --> 47:46.940]  But look at this.
[47:46.940 --> 47:52.860]  This is a huge increase in photosynthesis and growth and biomass
[47:52.860 --> 47:58.860]  production by elevating CO2, which is one of the keys of indoor agriculture
[47:58.860 --> 48:03.500]  is to realize this big increase.
[48:03.500 --> 48:04.700]  Now, one other thing.
[48:04.700 --> 48:13.620]  If you don't elevate in CO2, this graph goes the other direction.
[48:13.620 --> 48:16.220]  Plants take CO2 out of the air.
[48:16.220 --> 48:20.820]  And if the room drops below 400, you'd just be amazed.
[48:20.820 --> 48:24.420]  I've seen rooms regularly go to 200.
[48:24.420 --> 48:30.020]  And wow, not doing anything is bad news because they suffocate.
[48:30.020 --> 48:32.180]  I mean, it's like having people in a closed box.
[48:32.180 --> 48:37.540]  They run out of oxygen. So if you don't enrich, you're going this direction.
[48:37.540 --> 48:43.880]  And if you do enrich, you're going that direction.
[48:43.880 --> 48:45.000]  Great.
[48:45.000 --> 48:45.920]  We have another question.
[48:45.920 --> 48:50.560]  How important is it to change the temperature during the day and the night?
[48:50.560 --> 48:55.160]  Is it recommended to set up one single temperature for indoor growing all the time?
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.480]  Or would it be better to set up a lower temperature during the dark period?
[49:00.480 --> 49:02.560]  Good question.
[49:02.560 --> 49:07.520]  Historically, with research on other crops, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers,
[49:07.520 --> 49:10.520]  we always give a cooler night.
[49:10.520 --> 49:12.440]  But that's to save money.
[49:12.440 --> 49:15.160]  We don't have to heat the greenhouse so much at night.
[49:15.200 --> 49:21.600]  And cannabis is so high value that that extra heat is not a big consideration.
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.720]  We have not found any advantage of a cooler night temperature.
[49:26.720 --> 49:29.920]  The plant is generally averaging the temperatures.
[49:29.920 --> 49:34.920]  So we typically have a constant temperature day and night.
[49:34.920 --> 49:37.320]  Now, we're still researching this.
[49:37.320 --> 49:39.360]  There's disease issues.
[49:39.360 --> 49:41.600]  There's condensation at night.
[49:41.600 --> 49:43.680]  There's a lot of interacting factors.
[49:43.680 --> 49:50.320]  But just from the straight physiology, we haven't found any value of having a warmer
[49:50.320 --> 49:53.240]  day and a cooler night.
[49:53.240 --> 49:54.920]  That's the quick answer.
[49:54.920 --> 49:59.580]  So.
[49:59.580 --> 50:01.500]  Another question.
[50:01.500 --> 50:03.860]  Curious about phosphorus partitioning.
[50:03.860 --> 50:10.140]  Do other field crops cannibalize tea to floral parts pre-seed?
[50:10.140 --> 50:12.380]  Yeah, another good question.
[50:12.380 --> 50:13.860]  Yes.
[50:13.860 --> 50:20.420]  All plants try to give their seeds a good start in life.
[50:20.420 --> 50:26.260]  So they pack the phosphorus into the seeds during the final weeks of maturity.
[50:26.260 --> 50:28.820]  So those little seeds have a bag lunch.
[50:28.820 --> 50:30.580]  They have a lot of phosphorus to start.
[50:30.580 --> 50:34.940]  And this is all a good thing for vigorous seeds.
[50:34.940 --> 50:37.740]  And so all plants do this.
[50:37.740 --> 50:40.740]  But cannabis is unique.
[50:40.940 --> 50:44.340]  First of all, with field crops, there's only so much a seed can hold.
[50:44.340 --> 50:49.500]  But now we go to cannabis with a big clump of flower and no seeds.
[50:49.500 --> 50:51.780]  And the plant, we call it panicking.
[50:51.780 --> 50:57.380]  It's still thinking, oh my God, I got to move flowers up there, phosphorus up there for
[50:57.380 --> 50:58.380]  the seeds.
[50:58.380 --> 50:59.620]  But there aren't any seeds.
[50:59.620 --> 51:04.420]  So it toss, it looks like it overcompensates.
[51:04.420 --> 51:07.140]  That's something you can help us with in breeding.
[51:07.140 --> 51:12.140]  So we don't keep the plant from panicking about this phosphorus at the end.
[51:12.140 --> 51:19.500]  But all of our data suggests it's cannibalizing the leaves for no gain.
[51:19.500 --> 51:25.590]  And it's why we end up having to put more phosphorus on.
[51:25.590 --> 51:27.230]  Great.
[51:27.230 --> 51:33.230]  Can you comment on the use of silica in soil media cultivation practices and if it is compatible
[51:33.230 --> 51:36.390]  with USDA organic certification?
[51:36.390 --> 51:38.230]  Yeah.
[51:38.470 --> 51:45.550]  I'm not super familiar with all the organic certifications, but we'll lost a night is
[51:45.550 --> 51:48.910]  a mineral and I've got to think that's pretty safe.
[51:48.910 --> 51:51.150]  It's just a ground up mineral.
[51:51.150 --> 51:53.470]  We put on rock phosphate all the time.
[51:53.470 --> 51:55.470]  That's a legal thing.
[51:55.470 --> 52:02.830]  So I would expect a ground up mineral like belastin that would be compatible with organic
[52:02.830 --> 52:03.830]  certifications.
[52:03.830 --> 52:05.870]  And it might, that might be well known.
[52:05.870 --> 52:07.550]  I just haven't looked at it.
[52:07.870 --> 52:10.910]  I know a lot of people are starting to use it.
[52:10.910 --> 52:14.950]  Great.
[52:14.950 --> 52:23.830]  Question about do, does ideal PPFD for environmental conditions change in the last few weeks before
[52:23.830 --> 52:24.830]  harvesting?
[52:24.830 --> 52:28.710]  Yeah, this is another really interesting question.
[52:28.710 --> 52:35.990]  And we get into the astute observations of historic cannabis growers.
[52:35.990 --> 52:37.670]  We call them the heritage growers.
[52:37.750 --> 52:40.510]  They were growing it before it was legal.
[52:40.510 --> 52:46.070]  And they don't necessarily have any background in the principles of plant science, but they're
[52:46.070 --> 52:48.310]  keen observers.
[52:48.310 --> 52:50.910]  And they've done all kinds of things with light.
[52:50.910 --> 52:58.070]  One of the things is put the plants in the dark for a few days prior to harvest.
[52:58.070 --> 52:59.550]  That's very unusual.
[52:59.550 --> 53:03.110]  I mean, photosynthesis stops.
[53:03.110 --> 53:07.230]  If there's anything going on with that, it's an indirect effect.
[53:07.790 --> 53:13.590]  And conversely, giving them ample light toward the end, you could make a case for that because
[53:13.590 --> 53:17.670]  now photosynthesis is high right before harvest.
[53:17.670 --> 53:24.110]  It could help quality of the crops, but the leaves are old and tired by that time.
[53:24.110 --> 53:30.190]  So we, it's like putting a grandpa on steroids so he can run the hundred yard dash fast.
[53:30.190 --> 53:33.390]  Well, steroids help, but would they help that grandpa?
[53:33.550 --> 53:37.710]  Well, maybe he should have got them earlier in the life cycle.
[53:37.710 --> 53:43.790]  So it's interesting to add light when a plant is sort of in the senescence phase, but some
[53:43.790 --> 53:45.950]  people argue for doing it.
[53:45.950 --> 53:49.760]  Great.
[53:49.760 --> 53:51.080]  Another question.
[53:51.080 --> 53:58.800]  Have you looked at any other cannabinoids for indoor growth, like barren cannabinoids?
[53:58.800 --> 54:01.560]  Like what kind of cannabinoids?
[54:01.560 --> 54:05.160]  Barren cannabinoids?
[54:05.160 --> 54:10.080]  We haven't done a ton of studies on minor cannabinoids.
[54:10.080 --> 54:25.160]  Keep in mind here, CBG goes to THC, CBD, and CBC.
[54:25.160 --> 54:26.360]  This is real minor.
[54:26.360 --> 54:27.720]  This is a teeny arrow.
[54:27.720 --> 54:31.120]  These are great big arrows here.
[54:31.120 --> 54:35.760]  And then these in turn go to other things in the biochemistry.
[54:35.760 --> 54:42.920]  These two here are 90% of the total cannabinoids in plants.
[54:42.920 --> 54:49.960]  So the other things that come out of this from other biochemical pathways are real interesting.
[54:49.960 --> 54:56.340]  Pharmaceutically trace amounts of CBN can be pharmaceutically important.
[54:56.340 --> 55:03.220]  We have not yet done much looking at manipulating the minor cannabinoids.
[55:03.220 --> 55:09.540]  It's something we're eager to get going on, but we focus mostly on these two right here.
[55:09.540 --> 55:15.860]  I think that answers the question.
[55:15.860 --> 55:24.460]  We have a couple questions about other potentially limiting nutrients, such as calcium or potassium.
[55:24.460 --> 55:26.340]  Could you comment on that?
[55:26.340 --> 55:27.340]  Yeah.
[55:27.820 --> 55:31.420]  You guys are really asking good questions.
[55:31.420 --> 55:38.940]  In all of plant physiology, all of us teach potassium is actively taken up and plants
[55:38.940 --> 55:43.180]  will accumulate huge amounts of potassium.
[55:43.180 --> 55:49.160]  Calcium is passively taken up, and we have a hard time getting enough calcium into many
[55:49.160 --> 55:51.420]  crop plants.
[55:51.420 --> 55:54.460]  In lettuce, lack of calcium is tip burn.
[55:54.460 --> 55:57.660]  In tomatoes, lack of calcium is blossom end rot.
[55:57.660 --> 56:02.500]  We have a whole long list of serious disorders from low calcium.
[56:02.500 --> 56:07.400]  Now we bring in cannabis and it turns the world upside down.
[56:07.400 --> 56:14.220]  In all of our studies with hydroponics, cannabis accumulates calcium as if it was actively
[56:14.220 --> 56:15.220]  absorbed.
[56:15.220 --> 56:19.260]  I mean, calcium is adequate at 1% or 2% in leaves.
[56:19.260 --> 56:22.780]  We've seen cannabis leaves at 8% calcium.
[56:22.780 --> 56:23.780]  It's amazing.
[56:23.780 --> 56:28.700]  It doesn't seem to be toxic, but this is just an amazing, and it depletes the solution of
[56:28.700 --> 56:29.860]  calcium.
[56:29.860 --> 56:32.420]  So do we need to give it more or is it?
[56:32.420 --> 56:33.740]  I think not.
[56:33.740 --> 56:35.580]  We keep giving it more.
[56:35.580 --> 56:38.900]  It can't control its appetite for calcium.
[56:38.900 --> 56:44.380]  Conversely, potassium is slowly absorbed by cannabis.
[56:44.500 --> 56:49.380]  It's not a fascinating thing from a plant physiology standpoint in terms of its ratio
[56:49.380 --> 56:56.460]  of taking up nutrients, but it sure takes up calcium fast, and we don't have any of
[56:56.460 --> 57:03.660]  the standard calcium deficiencies in cannabis that we do in all kinds of other horticultural
[57:03.660 --> 57:04.660]  crops.
[57:04.660 --> 57:13.660]  All right, we're getting to our 3 p.m. Eastern time here, so we'll have one last question.
[57:13.660 --> 57:19.100]  Would it be beneficial to grow hemp under 24 hours of light?
[57:19.100 --> 57:20.100]  Another great question.
[57:20.100 --> 57:23.660]  We'd probably go on for hours with these questions.
[57:23.660 --> 57:29.540]  First of all, it's a short day crop, so we need short days to get it to flower.
[57:29.540 --> 57:34.200]  If we just did 24 hours all the time, we'd get a massive crop and no flowers.
[57:34.200 --> 57:38.100]  So we need short days to get it flower.
[57:38.100 --> 57:42.820]  Now, do we need exactly 12 hours or can we go 13?
[57:42.980 --> 57:43.980]  Or should we go 14?
[57:43.980 --> 57:46.500]  It depends on the cultivar.
[57:46.500 --> 57:51.980]  And now we're going to work with breeders like everybody at Cornell and the USDA to
[57:51.980 --> 57:56.340]  develop lines that can take longer photo periods.
[57:56.340 --> 58:05.180]  If we give the plants 24 hours of light late in the life cycle, we have seen them revert.
[58:05.180 --> 58:08.660]  Instead of growing more flowers, they start to grow more leaves.
[58:08.660 --> 58:11.180]  So the quick answer to this is no.
[58:12.060 --> 58:14.460]  We can't grow it in 24 hours of light.
[58:14.460 --> 58:19.620]  It's too bad because we could get the daily light integral really high with continuous
[58:19.620 --> 58:23.140]  light, but the plant reverts to growing leaves again.
[58:23.140 --> 58:24.140]  Already.
[58:24.140 --> 58:26.700]  Well, I think we're at our end time here.
[58:26.700 --> 58:31.020]  So I'll thank Dr. Bugbee again for a fantastic talk.
[58:31.020 --> 58:35.820]  And thank you all for attending for all the fantastic questions.
[58:35.820 --> 58:40.060]  Just a reminder, in two weeks at the same time, we'll have Dr. Heather Bragg talking
[58:40.100 --> 58:43.540]  about hemp processing systems.
[58:43.540 --> 58:48.780]  And this video will be posted on YouTube if you'd like to watch it again.
[58:48.780 --> 58:49.780]  Thank you all.
[58:49.780 --> 58:50.780]  Thanks again, Bruce.
[58:50.780 --> 58:51.780]  Yes.
[58:51.780 --> 58:53.460]  Thanks for putting this together.
[58:53.460 --> 59:04.670]  Nice job.
[59:04.670 --> 59:10.590]  This has been a production of Cornell University on the web at cornell.edu.
