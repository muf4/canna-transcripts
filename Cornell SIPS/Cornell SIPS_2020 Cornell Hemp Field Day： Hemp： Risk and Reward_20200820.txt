[00:00.120 --> 00:04.700]  Good afternoon, I'm Mary Ulrich with Quinault Cooperative Extension in Orange
[00:04.700 --> 00:09.600]  County. I too am on the hemp team and I'm going to address a little bit about risk
[00:09.600 --> 00:14.320]  and reward because of course the question this year is the reward of
[00:14.320 --> 00:20.120]  hemp, the potential for profit, balance out with the risk because those two
[00:20.120 --> 00:26.960]  things should be in direct proportion to one another but they may not be. And so
[00:26.960 --> 00:32.400]  has hemp been all rainbows and kittens or is it a little wild westy? I've seen a
[00:32.400 --> 00:36.240]  lot of wild westy out there in the last couple of years and so I'm going to
[00:36.240 --> 00:42.400]  address a couple of ways to protect yourself from the bad actors and other
[00:42.400 --> 00:48.880]  potential negatives that occur. So how is risk measured and mitigated? You know we
[00:48.880 --> 00:54.280]  use cost of production data. John mentioned that it's coming along but the
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.280]  future market certainly is questionable. We certainly do need more of more
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.600]  interest from consumers to keep that price up to keep the demand up. We also
[01:04.600 --> 01:08.640]  mitigate risk with crop insurance. I don't know what the payments, I haven't
[01:08.640 --> 01:14.860]  talked to anybody who signed up for crop insurance and I mean the USDA FSA crop
[01:14.860 --> 01:20.620]  insurance, so I don't know what those payments are going to be for 2020. My
[01:20.620 --> 01:23.880]  prediction last year was that they were either going to be really good or really
[01:23.880 --> 01:27.960]  bad and so we'll see what happens with them. I'm always curious to talk to
[01:27.960 --> 01:31.880]  people who've had insurance so if you've had insurance please give me a ring
[01:31.880 --> 01:38.440]  because private or the federal government supported ones that would be
[01:38.440 --> 01:43.600]  I'd love that information. So and also one way to protect yourself or to
[01:43.600 --> 01:50.640]  mitigate risk is to have a contract and of course with the 2018 farm bill going
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.200]  to be brought into effect in New York State by the end of the year. There's
[01:55.200 --> 01:58.600]  lots of changes in the landscape happening and of course we're not used
[01:58.600 --> 02:03.840]  to legislation changing so quickly around crops but the last few years this
[02:03.840 --> 02:08.200]  has been quite a little roller coaster so that in itself is a risk that you
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.520]  don't know where things are going to go legislatively. Of course the big force
[02:12.520 --> 02:19.320]  majeure or the big risk is that FDA may decide to regulate the crop particularly
[02:19.360 --> 02:26.920]  in the case of CBD and that could have a huge impact on markets production. If
[02:26.920 --> 02:33.080]  FDA said no no this is a drug and everybody has to have just like a drug
[02:33.080 --> 02:38.060]  everybody has to have the same kind of testing and monitoring then there would
[02:38.060 --> 02:43.000]  be a lot of producers and processors that would no longer have a market
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.920]  because they couldn't meet those requirements. And so the other thing I
[02:46.920 --> 02:50.960]  just want to say about contracts you know if it sounds too good to be true it
[02:50.960 --> 02:57.280]  probably is and I'm going to show you a flyer in a minute that can help you out
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.360]  in terms of contracts. So what's the biggest thing that I see as a problem
[03:02.360 --> 03:09.280]  with hemp contracts or hemp relationships right now is that there's
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.040]  no collective knowledge. You know we for produce we have the Blue Book so the
[03:14.040 --> 03:20.160]  people can go look up buyers in New York State. Buyers are bonded so that if
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.520]  a seller doesn't get paid they can go to the state and get reimbursed through
[03:24.520 --> 03:28.740]  that bonding process. If you know they really didn't get paid for something
[03:28.740 --> 03:33.680]  that they sold and everything was supposed to be okay and the seller just
[03:33.680 --> 03:37.800]  didn't get their money there's a way to get it back but in hemp that doesn't
[03:37.800 --> 03:42.080]  exist right now. And there's no institutional memory which we should
[03:42.080 --> 03:48.200]  have or we have in other businesses. You know who is going to pay you. You know
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.960]  who the traditional bad actors are. You know the guys who pay in 30 60 90 and
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.020]  the ones who don't. If you don't know your neighbors do and so sharing
[03:57.020 --> 04:01.760]  information about that in other crops has been very open and hemp it has not
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.040]  been. So even what little institutional memory is being gathered it's not being
[04:07.120 --> 04:14.240]  shared and so it seems like bad actors are going from farm to farm or from
[04:14.240 --> 04:18.800]  region to region and causing trouble. And certainly this isn't just about CBD. I've
[04:18.800 --> 04:23.120]  had it happen that folks selling grain came to me because they didn't get paid
[04:23.120 --> 04:26.880]  for their grain because the buyer said that it was moldy but didn't tell them
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.920]  it was moldy until like three months later. So there's no way to trace back
[04:30.920 --> 04:37.160]  whose fault that was. It was just very unfortunate. And so also very unusual
[04:37.160 --> 04:42.440]  relationships between value and cost that the farmer needs to buy into the
[04:42.440 --> 04:47.480]  processing somehow which is really you know not the case. Ocean Spray you know
[04:47.480 --> 04:52.840]  really doesn't need the farmers necessarily to buy into the processing
[04:52.840 --> 04:56.800]  part itself. They might be a co-op in terms of selling but do they own the
[04:56.800 --> 05:04.120]  equipment? Maybe not. Or orange juice companies or any of those. There isn't
[05:04.120 --> 05:09.160]  that same kind of need to be involved. There's a lot of interest from people
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.240]  who have never been involved in agriculture. That can be a little bit of
[05:13.240 --> 05:16.960]  a problem. There's also what I call the billionaire rule. There's a lot of folks
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.840]  running around saying oh I have billionaire friends. Well unless you see
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.560]  a picture of him with Warren Buffett like on his Christmas card don't believe
[05:24.560 --> 05:29.640]  it. So one of the local growers actually said if it's a good party it'll still be
[05:29.640 --> 05:33.320]  going in a couple of years and if it's a bad party I never wanted to go in the
[05:33.320 --> 05:36.800]  first place. He said that one question about why he was because he was gonna
[05:36.800 --> 05:43.160]  grow and then changed his mind in the last minute in 19. And so just using
[05:43.160 --> 05:50.200]  caution. So to try and look more closely at some of those contract details
[05:50.200 --> 05:56.560]  there's this six page pamphlet. The first two pages are about production
[05:56.560 --> 06:00.960]  stuff but then the next four about contracts. I wrote it with the assistance
[06:00.960 --> 06:07.520]  of several attorneys, agricultural attorneys. And so just have a look at
[06:07.520 --> 06:13.680]  that. It's on both the Cornell website and the hemp blog. Here's the pages and
[06:13.680 --> 06:18.240]  so the blog is on the left. That's what it looks like and so there's regular
[06:18.480 --> 06:22.640]  updates there and updates for meetings and things like that. There's also the
[06:22.640 --> 06:27.240]  link for the contract thing and on the right don't forget that Cornell has its
[06:27.240 --> 06:31.560]  own website and then the team whether it's other people you've heard from
[06:31.560 --> 06:37.360]  today or John or Lindsey or myself all of our contact information is also on
[06:37.360 --> 06:40.720]  there on the team website.
