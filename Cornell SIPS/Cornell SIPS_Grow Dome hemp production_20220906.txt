[00:00.000 --> 00:07.530]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.530 --> 00:08.650]  Take it away, Donato.
[00:08.650 --> 00:10.110]  All right, good morning, everybody.
[00:10.110 --> 00:12.130]  And thank you, Larry, for having me.
[00:12.130 --> 00:14.570]  I appreciate you taking me on two years ago,
[00:14.570 --> 00:16.330]  a kid with a crazy idea.
[00:16.330 --> 00:19.650]  So today, what, well, first of all, my name is Donato Fraioli.
[00:19.650 --> 00:21.350]  And today, what we're going to talk about
[00:21.350 --> 00:24.170]  is my patent, Grow Dome.
[00:24.170 --> 00:26.570]  And before we get into it, it'll be a little easier
[00:26.570 --> 00:29.330]  to explain how we got here if I first tell you
[00:29.330 --> 00:31.730]  what my family business does.
[00:31.730 --> 00:32.570]  There we go.
[00:32.570 --> 00:35.050]  All right, so what we do is we build
[00:35.050 --> 00:36.130]  air-supported structures.
[00:36.130 --> 00:39.650]  My grandfather founded the company 60 years ago.
[00:39.650 --> 00:42.570]  I have had the great opportunity to learn under him
[00:42.570 --> 00:47.010]  and work with NFL teams, MLS teams.
[00:47.010 --> 00:49.490]  I have done everything from a Bitcoin mining dome
[00:49.490 --> 00:53.090]  this winter to a dome going out to New Zealand.
[00:53.090 --> 00:55.690]  So we cover quite a bit of ground.
[00:55.690 --> 00:58.650]  Our structures are used for many different things.
[00:58.650 --> 01:02.250]  But my passion as a kid growing up was agriculture.
[01:02.930 --> 01:05.570]  So I tried to figure out a way to weld that
[01:05.570 --> 01:07.330]  into our family's business.
[01:08.210 --> 01:13.210]  Being a kid, I had this vision of what can we do
[01:14.490 --> 01:16.170]  to feed the world, right?
[01:16.170 --> 01:19.770]  And what me and my lovely mother back there
[01:19.770 --> 01:23.250]  in the back row came up with was what we call Grow Dome.
[01:24.450 --> 01:29.450]  The concept was to feed the hungry people of the world,
[01:29.610 --> 01:31.810]  which was an ambitious goal.
[01:32.370 --> 01:33.730]  But one I learned very quickly,
[01:33.730 --> 01:36.370]  you need to make money to do that.
[01:36.370 --> 01:38.650]  With that said, I didn't learn that lesson
[01:38.650 --> 01:42.370]  until we fully developed this design,
[01:42.370 --> 01:46.170]  which essentially is our standard air-inflated product
[01:47.450 --> 01:51.770]  attached to a shipping container with an HVAC unit in it,
[01:51.770 --> 01:53.610]  entrance and egress doors,
[01:53.610 --> 01:57.250]  so that this was a modular portable system
[01:57.250 --> 02:00.170]  that could be dropped down with no site construction
[02:00.170 --> 02:03.370]  except earth anchorage and inflated
[02:03.370 --> 02:05.050]  in a matter of a couple of days
[02:05.050 --> 02:08.730]  so that you could have an indoor grow space.
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.680]  So some of the basic specs on it,
[02:13.680 --> 02:16.040]  and what I worked here with Larry on,
[02:16.040 --> 02:17.640]  actually ours is only 100 feet long,
[02:17.640 --> 02:22.640]  but it's basically 100 to an expandable four, five, 600,
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.120]  whatever you can imagine in terms of length.
[02:27.120 --> 02:30.760]  Structure, it's made out of a vinyl-coated polyester.
[02:32.080 --> 02:34.880]  It actually has, which is really cool,
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.200]  a pretty good insulation value for a greenhouse,
[02:38.200 --> 02:39.400]  which would be R4.
[02:39.400 --> 02:41.640]  We achieved that by having an outer skin
[02:41.640 --> 02:43.080]  and a dead air space.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.880]  There's an emergency backup system that can come with it
[02:46.880 --> 02:48.240]  and our cable net system.
[02:48.240 --> 02:51.600]  So when you look at the position of where I want this to be
[02:51.600 --> 02:54.280]  between your conventional greenhouse like we have here
[02:54.280 --> 02:56.880]  or your standard hoop houses that kind of blow away,
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.960]  I kind of want to live in the middle grounds.
[02:58.960 --> 03:01.800]  And when the last speaker talked about scale
[03:01.800 --> 03:04.800]  and making hemp work at scale or anything work at scale,
[03:04.800 --> 03:07.000]  the beauty of these, as you grow them,
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.960]  the cost per square foot shrinks.
[03:09.880 --> 03:13.440]  So my hope one day is I fly over the Midwest
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.240]  and I see a bunch of these deployed.
[03:17.930 --> 03:19.490]  The cool thing about dome construction,
[03:19.490 --> 03:22.090]  whether it's Grow Dome or my conventional construction,
[03:22.090 --> 03:27.090]  is it's modular in design, meaning we can change lengths,
[03:27.130 --> 03:30.010]  we can change widths, but for Grow Dome itself,
[03:30.530 --> 03:31.450]  by simply adding in bands,
[03:31.450 --> 03:33.050]  if we wanted to expand our project,
[03:33.050 --> 03:35.170]  we could actually just add in center sections,
[03:35.170 --> 03:37.130]  if you imagine it as a loaf of bread,
[03:37.130 --> 03:40.610]  and grow the structure in length very easily.
[03:40.610 --> 03:42.050]  It's transportable because,
[03:42.050 --> 03:44.370]  as I'll show you on the next slide of video,
[03:44.370 --> 03:46.010]  everything fits into that container,
[03:46.010 --> 03:48.730]  goes on a 40 foot truck, it's dumped off,
[03:48.730 --> 03:51.010]  and you're off to the races.
[03:51.010 --> 03:53.090]  It's lasted through these very exciting winters
[03:53.090 --> 03:56.210]  you have up here, so I proved that to myself.
[03:56.210 --> 03:57.410]  We can heat and cool.
[03:57.410 --> 03:59.370]  Right now we have just heating.
[03:59.370 --> 04:01.730]  We just installed, and as I've learned a lot
[04:01.730 --> 04:03.850]  from this experiment we've been running,
[04:04.810 --> 04:07.810]  filters to filter all the air going in.
[04:07.810 --> 04:11.170]  The basic premise of my structures is air holds them up.
[04:11.170 --> 04:12.690]  So you simply inflate the system.
[04:12.690 --> 04:15.370]  It's a columnless system with positive pressure,
[04:15.370 --> 04:18.330]  meaning it's difficult for bugs to get in.
[04:18.330 --> 04:22.050]  It keeps smells in, pests out,
[04:22.970 --> 04:25.130]  and we can control the pollen going in
[04:25.130 --> 04:27.050]  with a filtering system.
[04:27.050 --> 04:30.170]  And at scale, the construction can become very low cost.
[04:32.250 --> 04:35.530]  So this was some of my earlier visions and designs.
[04:35.530 --> 04:37.490]  Again, I was looking to feed villages,
[04:37.490 --> 04:41.330]  not necessarily look at hemp or cannabis in the beginning.
[04:41.330 --> 04:44.010]  And while we have studied hemp and cannabis,
[04:44.010 --> 04:49.010]  well, hemp here, I think this can be a great product
[04:49.050 --> 04:53.050]  for a farmer to buy and have an exceeding extension
[04:53.050 --> 04:55.450]  to grow high value crops locally
[04:55.450 --> 04:57.330]  through our tough winters.
[04:57.330 --> 04:59.050]  I know Larry really sees this
[04:59.050 --> 05:01.930]  as a season extension opportunity
[05:01.930 --> 05:04.970]  to get two crops per season.
[05:04.970 --> 05:06.650]  But I still do believe,
[05:06.650 --> 05:08.970]  and one of the next things we'll do when I do my next study,
[05:08.970 --> 05:11.730]  I will be bringing Grow Dome back to our factory.
[05:11.730 --> 05:13.250]  We will be doing an economic study
[05:13.250 --> 05:16.650]  on high value crops being grown in
[05:16.650 --> 05:18.170]  so I can give a business case.
[05:23.880 --> 05:26.920]  All right, so the vision in the pictures
[05:26.920 --> 05:28.520]  turned out to be this.
[05:28.520 --> 05:31.320]  I thought it would be a little self-explanatory.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.800]  Hopefully this works.
[05:34.720 --> 05:36.960]  All right, so this is Grow Dome showing up on the truck.
[05:36.960 --> 05:39.160]  I think this is at the Loomis Fields, what you call it?
[05:39.160 --> 05:40.480]  Yep.
[05:40.480 --> 05:42.000]  So we dropped it off that day.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.320]  Everything was done in a little bit of stages,
[05:45.200 --> 05:47.560]  but what we did is we basically used a jackhammer
[05:47.560 --> 05:50.240]  and one man, we installed earth anchors,
[05:50.240 --> 05:52.800]  we tested all the earth anchors.
[05:52.800 --> 05:54.480]  We then come back a couple months later,
[05:54.480 --> 05:56.120]  it could have been the same day.
[05:56.120 --> 05:57.520]  We take the structure.
[05:57.520 --> 06:00.480]  This is the 3,600 square foot structure.
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.920]  Small crew unrolls it.
[06:06.120 --> 06:08.280]  I think this was a two-day process for us.
[06:08.280 --> 06:10.200]  The goal is to get this down to a one-day process.
[06:10.200 --> 06:11.240]  And as you can imagine,
[06:11.240 --> 06:13.840]  this was a learning curve the first time doing this.
[06:15.040 --> 06:17.640]  We spread it out over the ground.
[06:17.640 --> 06:19.840]  I did beat the high tunnels up next to me.
[06:19.840 --> 06:22.080]  So I thought that was positive.
[06:22.080 --> 06:23.960]  You clamp these sections together.
[06:23.960 --> 06:27.120]  The sections are what I'm saying, it's modular.
[06:27.760 --> 06:28.600]  We could make this much longer
[06:28.600 --> 06:30.680]  by simply adding in more center sections.
[06:32.080 --> 06:34.880]  Once we had all of these sections spread out,
[06:34.880 --> 06:36.600]  it gets attached to the building.
[06:37.760 --> 06:39.200]  You can see it simply goes together
[06:39.200 --> 06:41.560]  with a little heat gun and some joints.
[06:41.560 --> 06:44.360]  All simple stuff, all pre-manufactured in our factory
[06:44.360 --> 06:46.360]  in upstate New York,
[06:46.360 --> 06:48.920]  where we build all of our air supported structures.
[06:50.160 --> 06:52.280]  That's me getting a good day of labor in.
[06:53.280 --> 06:56.280]  I've filmed these videos myself, so be patient with them.
[06:56.280 --> 06:58.840]  I didn't know what type of time limit would be under.
[07:00.520 --> 07:02.640]  Over the top of the fabric, there goes the cable.
[07:02.640 --> 07:05.000]  The cable's what gives you all your structural capacity.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.080]  So this is actually one of our company's
[07:07.080 --> 07:08.960]  general biggest patents.
[07:08.960 --> 07:10.480]  When you take a lightweight fabric,
[07:10.480 --> 07:12.480]  which is just a 14 ounce fabric,
[07:13.880 --> 07:16.840]  when you inflate that into the cable itself,
[07:16.840 --> 07:20.000]  the steel cable, the cable actually,
[07:20.000 --> 07:21.440]  takes all the fabric stress,
[07:21.440 --> 07:23.440]  takes it to the cable and down to the earth anchors
[07:23.440 --> 07:24.920]  at the bottom.
[07:24.920 --> 07:27.280]  And what that does is it allows a very lightweight
[07:27.280 --> 07:30.680]  14 ounce fabric to withstand a 50 pound ground snow load
[07:30.680 --> 07:33.560]  and about 110 mile an hour wind load, I believe,
[07:33.560 --> 07:35.000]  just off the top of the cuff.
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.200]  This is the finished product.
[07:37.200 --> 07:39.800]  It inflates in about 45 minutes.
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.000]  We were really pleased.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.800]  Again, this was a first shot at it.
[07:44.800 --> 07:47.240]  As you can see, there's a garage door at the end.
[07:47.440 --> 07:49.040]  The HVAC sits within.
[07:49.040 --> 07:51.600]  For now, on our first design,
[07:51.600 --> 07:53.360]  we had a generator sitting outside,
[07:53.360 --> 07:56.480]  but that could easily be sitting on top of the container.
[07:56.480 --> 07:58.920]  And at the end of the day,
[07:58.920 --> 08:03.120]  we were inside with a raw field,
[08:03.120 --> 08:06.440]  which then Larry had to get to work planting.
[08:06.440 --> 08:10.520]  So let me shift this off if I could.
[08:10.520 --> 08:12.480]  So, okay, I can click it now too.
[08:12.480 --> 08:13.560]  It's working, okay.
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.280]  So those are the disreviews.
[08:15.280 --> 08:17.160]  I took some shots.
[08:17.160 --> 08:18.160]  As you can see at the bottom
[08:18.160 --> 08:19.960]  is where all the earth anchors go in.
[08:21.600 --> 08:23.200]  That's the cabling system on top
[08:23.200 --> 08:26.600]  I was just talking about transferring the load.
[08:26.600 --> 08:28.000]  And what was this field?
[08:29.120 --> 08:31.120]  Just a couple months later,
[08:31.120 --> 08:32.560]  Larry had a ton of hemp in there.
[08:32.560 --> 08:35.840]  We have learned a lot and we know what we need to do.
[08:35.840 --> 08:37.680]  If you can see on the back end,
[08:37.680 --> 08:40.640]  we added in some fabric vents to increase air flow.
[08:40.680 --> 08:43.040]  To the outside, keep the space a little cooler.
[08:43.040 --> 08:45.440]  This is a working living, breathing project.
[08:45.440 --> 08:48.680]  You can see the inner skin hanging away from the outer skin,
[08:48.680 --> 08:50.800]  which actually gives you your R value.
[08:53.040 --> 08:54.200]  Close up of the plant.
[08:55.200 --> 09:00.200]  So we have a little work to do here, no doubt, Larry,
[09:00.720 --> 09:01.840]  but we're trying to get to a point
[09:01.840 --> 09:04.840]  where we can have a very finished end product.
[09:04.960 --> 09:06.560]  I just wanted to run through quickly.
[09:06.560 --> 09:09.280]  I know it's kind of not your guys forte potentially,
[09:09.280 --> 09:10.720]  but really where I see this going
[09:10.720 --> 09:13.360]  is in the first few steps of the food cycle.
[09:13.360 --> 09:17.400]  I would love to see my product minimizing pesticides
[09:17.400 --> 09:18.640]  because you're growing indoors,
[09:18.640 --> 09:20.920]  minimizing cross-pollination.
[09:20.920 --> 09:22.840]  Ideally, because we're indoors,
[09:22.840 --> 09:25.840]  we can get a more uniform crop,
[09:25.840 --> 09:29.320]  minimize the labor associated by using some machinery.
[09:29.320 --> 09:31.800]  And then we can get a more uniform crop
[09:31.840 --> 09:35.200]  minimize the labor associated by using some machinery,
[09:35.200 --> 09:37.360]  get obviously consistent production.
[09:37.360 --> 09:39.680]  As we know, environmental conditions kill you.
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.320]  One of my thoughts was to have a second container
[09:43.320 --> 09:44.280]  on the opposite side.
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.040]  So while you have food production occurring in the space,
[09:48.040 --> 09:50.920]  food processing could be done outside of the space,
[09:50.920 --> 09:52.280]  right in the adjacent container.
[09:52.280 --> 09:54.880]  So it could be a system where the equipment's brought in,
[09:54.880 --> 09:56.120]  the planting is done,
[09:56.120 --> 09:58.400]  and then the food is processed and packaged
[09:58.400 --> 10:00.000]  and ready for distribution.
[10:00.920 --> 10:04.160]  I would like to obviously bring this more localized.
[10:04.160 --> 10:06.440]  I myself deal with a lot of shipping in our main business.
[10:06.440 --> 10:10.560]  I can tell you there's a lot of cost associated with that
[10:10.560 --> 10:11.640]  and headache nowadays.
[10:11.640 --> 10:14.600]  So I really think we can do a good job
[10:14.600 --> 10:17.240]  of getting these in localized areas,
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.360]  whether it's hemp or just food itself.
[10:21.720 --> 10:23.400]  And then from the sales end of it,
[10:24.360 --> 10:25.920]  you'll get a longer shelf life
[10:25.920 --> 10:28.320]  because you're not having a long transport.
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.760]  We can grow during the growing season, fresh produce.
[10:31.760 --> 10:34.080]  And I usually find customers are really willing to pay
[10:34.080 --> 10:36.480]  when they can see what they're eating basically.
[10:38.720 --> 10:41.280]  As I said, I'm gonna do a little study for myself.
[10:41.280 --> 10:43.680]  I would actually like to connect with the last speaker
[10:43.680 --> 10:45.000]  a little bit on the hemp end of things
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.920]  so we can look at some of the numbers.
[10:46.920 --> 10:48.800]  But just like when we built the first tennis structure,
[10:48.800 --> 10:50.720]  we owned and operated them ourselves
[10:50.720 --> 10:52.120]  because once you have a business model,
[10:52.120 --> 10:53.840]  then you can easily go to obviously the farmers
[10:53.840 --> 10:56.560]  and companies and say, hey, spend X,
[10:56.560 --> 10:57.840]  you'll get this type of return.
[10:58.360 --> 11:01.080]  So I wanna have that all proven out as well.
[11:01.080 --> 11:02.520]  So in short, thank you.
[11:02.520 --> 11:04.640]  And if you have any questions, I'm around.
[11:10.930 --> 11:12.250]  If there's one question,
[11:12.250 --> 11:14.370]  we'll take one question for Donato.
[11:15.930 --> 11:19.530]  I should, but let me, I don't have a contact slide.
[11:19.530 --> 11:20.370]  I should have done that.
[11:20.370 --> 11:21.290]  Give me my card back.
[11:21.290 --> 11:22.130]  Go ahead.
[11:25.220 --> 11:26.340]  So you might-
[11:26.340 --> 11:28.500]  The question was about the light transmission
[11:28.500 --> 11:29.900]  through the dome, yeah.
[11:29.900 --> 11:34.900]  So I think each layer has 67% and there's two layers.
[11:35.740 --> 11:40.260]  You have the calcs on what came exactly through,
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.580]  which we can, I don't know.
[11:41.580 --> 11:44.700]  Yeah, so we had a weather station inside the grow dome
[11:44.700 --> 11:47.500]  and in the adjacent high tunnel.
[11:47.500 --> 11:51.500]  And I believe the, I don't have the exact numbers
[11:51.500 --> 11:55.460]  on my head, but generally I think the PAR
[11:55.460 --> 11:57.380]  within the grow dome was about half
[11:57.420 --> 12:00.300]  of what we were getting in the adjacent high tunnel.
[12:00.300 --> 12:02.580]  And just to add to that, I'm working with a company
[12:02.580 --> 12:04.260]  who came up here and visited the site
[12:04.260 --> 12:06.100]  for a fully recyclable envelope
[12:06.100 --> 12:08.340]  with about twice the translucency.
[12:08.340 --> 12:10.540]  So we're hoping to improve on that as well.
[12:13.180 --> 12:17.100]  So at scale, I think I'm gonna bring those costs
[12:17.100 --> 12:21.140]  into the $300,000 range for a model that's 400 feet long.
[12:22.180 --> 12:24.420]  So, but right now, if I'm gonna sell it,
[12:24.420 --> 12:25.580]  again, it's very difficult
[12:25.620 --> 12:28.140]  because I have to cover my factory's overhead.
[12:28.140 --> 12:30.220]  So right now, if you're to buy this today,
[12:30.220 --> 12:33.180]  I can usually sell this at $400,000.
[12:33.180 --> 12:35.180]  But my goal is at scale, you know,
[12:35.180 --> 12:36.620]  the shipping container costs are expensive
[12:36.620 --> 12:39.220]  because it's customized, units are expensive.
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.260]  I think I can take about 25% of that out
[12:41.260 --> 12:42.380]  once we get to scale.
[12:48.740 --> 12:50.180]  As long as you can put in earth anchors,
[12:50.180 --> 12:52.820]  which we did by hand, but if you had a machine to do.
[12:55.820 --> 12:57.820]  I'm curious if that's a problem.
[12:57.820 --> 12:59.460]  So actually, to be honest with you,
[12:59.460 --> 13:01.460]  I normally don't key weld them on.
[13:01.460 --> 13:03.500]  Most of our structures in our conventional business
[13:03.500 --> 13:05.420]  come up and down yearly.
[13:05.420 --> 13:07.700]  We just did that to prevent any rain from coming through
[13:07.700 --> 13:09.140]  and really seal it up tight.
[13:09.140 --> 13:11.420]  Those clamps, so that flap usually just sits over
[13:11.420 --> 13:14.020]  naturally, those clamps just drill on and drill off.
[13:16.340 --> 13:19.140]  Okay, last question.
[13:31.210 --> 13:32.730]  Absolutely, so I wanna get it to a point
[13:32.730 --> 13:34.890]  where I feel very comfortable in selling something, right?
[13:34.890 --> 13:36.610]  Because everything we do, our company
[13:36.610 --> 13:37.810]  or my family's name's on the line.
[13:37.810 --> 13:40.650]  So if we have a product,
[13:40.650 --> 13:42.210]  which I feel we're getting pretty close to
[13:42.210 --> 13:44.410]  where we can sell it and you can comfortably grow in it,
[13:44.410 --> 13:46.490]  the skin itself can change,
[13:46.490 --> 13:49.930]  the mechanical equipment itself now put filters in.
[13:49.930 --> 13:52.610]  So yeah, any improvements on the skin are very low cost
[13:52.610 --> 13:54.290]  because it's the smallest part of the structure.
[13:54.290 --> 13:56.330]  So we can definitely pass all that stuff on.
[13:57.370 --> 13:59.090]  Okay, thanks again, Donato.
[13:59.570 --> 14:07.380]  Thank you.
