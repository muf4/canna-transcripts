[00:00.000 --> 00:02.560]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.650 --> 00:09.370]  Good morning, everyone.
[00:09.370 --> 00:11.110]  So I direct Cornell's
[00:11.110 --> 00:12.990]  Controlled Environment Agriculture Group,
[00:12.990 --> 00:17.050]  which is growing plants in greenhouses and indoors.
[00:17.050 --> 00:19.410]  So I was curious how many of you
[00:19.410 --> 00:22.370]  work with growing cannabis products in greenhouses
[00:22.370 --> 00:25.370]  or indoors in some capacity by show of hands.
[00:25.370 --> 00:26.450]  Okay, good.
[00:26.450 --> 00:29.370]  So my talk today will be most relevant to you.
[00:29.370 --> 00:30.710]  If you're growing in the field
[00:30.710 --> 00:34.270]  and you work with transplants that you receive,
[00:34.270 --> 00:35.670]  this is also gonna be relevant.
[00:35.670 --> 00:37.950]  So I was asked to speak specifically
[00:37.950 --> 00:40.510]  on substrate testing for soilless hemp.
[00:40.510 --> 00:43.350]  And so that root zone where hemp is grown,
[00:43.350 --> 00:47.050]  either propagating plants or growing the plants
[00:47.050 --> 00:49.870]  through till flowering is very important.
[00:49.870 --> 00:52.230]  And you can really affect the plant health
[00:52.230 --> 00:56.550]  and productivity through that root zone.
[00:56.550 --> 00:58.710]  So instead of growing in soil,
[00:58.710 --> 01:00.230]  when we're growing in containers,
[01:00.230 --> 01:02.790]  we say that we're growing in soilless media
[01:03.710 --> 01:06.690]  or soilless potting mixes.
[01:06.690 --> 01:11.070]  And the goal of that media is the same as it is in the soil,
[01:11.070 --> 01:14.370]  which is to store and supply water, nutrients,
[01:14.370 --> 01:16.750]  and oxygen to the plant.
[01:16.750 --> 01:20.330]  And that oxygen component is actually really important.
[01:20.330 --> 01:22.350]  Roots need oxygen to respire,
[01:22.350 --> 01:24.590]  just like we need oxygen to breathe.
[01:24.590 --> 01:28.790]  And hemp roots are very sensitive to root diseases
[01:28.790 --> 01:31.730]  if they don't have sufficient oxygen.
[01:32.790 --> 01:37.310]  That soilless mix, that media also anchors the plant
[01:37.310 --> 01:39.930]  into the container so they don't flop over.
[01:39.930 --> 01:43.010]  And then I'm gonna talk about the important physical
[01:43.010 --> 01:46.130]  and chemical properties that you can have tested
[01:46.130 --> 01:47.890]  of your potting mixes.
[01:49.430 --> 01:51.430]  So just as a introduction,
[01:51.430 --> 01:54.290]  the different soilless media that we have available,
[01:54.290 --> 01:56.750]  we often split those into two groups.
[01:56.750 --> 01:58.550]  One are the organic components.
[01:59.310 --> 02:01.470]  And what I mean by organic in this case is carbon-based.
[02:01.470 --> 02:05.150]  So they're typically plant or animal residues.
[02:05.150 --> 02:07.090]  A coconut core is very common,
[02:07.090 --> 02:10.110]  the shredded husk of coconut that can be compressed
[02:10.110 --> 02:11.970]  and easy to ship.
[02:11.970 --> 02:16.210]  Peat, mined decomposed sphagnum peat moss,
[02:16.210 --> 02:21.210]  composted bark and wood, rice hulls, biochar, and compost.
[02:21.310 --> 02:25.190]  So those, because they're carbon-based materials,
[02:25.190 --> 02:28.830]  they have a fairly good nutrient holding capacity as well,
[02:28.830 --> 02:33.070]  or cation exchange capacity is what we talk about.
[02:33.070 --> 02:35.230]  And then we also have inert components
[02:35.230 --> 02:36.750]  that are not carbon-based.
[02:36.750 --> 02:39.310]  So those would be like this picture on the bottom right,
[02:39.310 --> 02:41.450]  which is stone wool or rock wool,
[02:41.450 --> 02:43.870]  is a spun insulation material.
[02:43.870 --> 02:45.510]  It has very good physical properties.
[02:45.510 --> 02:50.510]  It's good at holding onto water and allowing airspace,
[02:50.510 --> 02:54.270]  but it doesn't have an additional nutrient holding capacity.
[02:54.270 --> 02:57.750]  So when we're growing plants in this type of substrate,
[02:57.750 --> 03:01.870]  we have to supply nutrients every time that we're watering.
[03:01.870 --> 03:04.510]  Perlite and vermiculite are other examples of that,
[03:04.510 --> 03:07.370]  as well as lightweight expanded clay aggregate.
[03:08.230 --> 03:12.030]  So it's important to know the materials that you're using.
[03:12.030 --> 03:15.050]  You can talk with the manufacturer of them
[03:15.050 --> 03:17.470]  to see if they should do their own in-house testing
[03:17.470 --> 03:19.190]  for these physical and chemical properties
[03:19.190 --> 03:21.110]  that I'm about to talk to.
[03:21.110 --> 03:24.390]  That would be a sign of a reputable supplier.
[03:24.390 --> 03:27.310]  If they can't provide you with a nutritional test
[03:27.310 --> 03:30.310]  or information on the physical properties,
[03:30.310 --> 03:33.070]  you can also do some of the testing yourself,
[03:33.070 --> 03:33.910]  which I'll talk about,
[03:33.910 --> 03:36.310]  and other components you can send to a lab.
[03:37.910 --> 03:39.990]  So when we're talking about the physical properties,
[03:39.990 --> 03:44.990]  this is the balance of the water holding and air porosity.
[03:45.970 --> 03:49.430]  And so when we fill a container with a mix,
[03:49.430 --> 03:53.270]  we have the substrate itself or the particles itself,
[03:53.270 --> 03:56.310]  and then we have space that's not taken up
[03:56.310 --> 03:57.690]  by those particles.
[03:57.690 --> 04:00.870]  And when we water a container to container capacity,
[04:00.870 --> 04:04.030]  that is watering a container fully with water
[04:04.030 --> 04:06.550]  and allowing it to drip drain,
[04:06.550 --> 04:09.710]  then of those total pore spaces,
[04:09.710 --> 04:12.390]  they're gonna be divided into some of those spaces
[04:12.390 --> 04:13.790]  are still holding air.
[04:13.790 --> 04:16.190]  So that's called the air filled porosity,
[04:16.190 --> 04:18.830]  and that's a percent by volume.
[04:18.830 --> 04:20.870]  And then we have water holding capacity.
[04:20.870 --> 04:24.990]  So those are the pore spaces that are filled by water.
[04:24.990 --> 04:27.870]  And so the right soilless media is gonna have a balance
[04:27.870 --> 04:31.230]  between the moisture holding and the air porosity.
[04:31.230 --> 04:33.190]  And one of the ways that we can think about that
[04:33.190 --> 04:37.830]  is that water holding capacity and aeration balance
[04:37.830 --> 04:40.590]  and the height of the water table in the pot
[04:40.590 --> 04:44.230]  is really only affected by that particle size,
[04:44.230 --> 04:46.430]  where a smaller particle size
[04:46.430 --> 04:48.210]  is gonna be like that container on the right
[04:48.590 --> 04:50.730]  that holds more water and less air.
[04:50.730 --> 04:52.770]  And if you have a larger particle size,
[04:52.770 --> 04:56.330]  you're gonna hold more air and less water.
[04:56.330 --> 05:00.090]  And often you will see that potting mixes are formulated
[05:00.090 --> 05:03.310]  to contain multiple components.
[05:03.310 --> 05:05.450]  So we might have like peat
[05:05.450 --> 05:07.970]  as well as perlite and vermiculite,
[05:07.970 --> 05:11.030]  because together they give us the physical properties
[05:11.030 --> 05:11.870]  that we need.
[05:11.870 --> 05:16.870]  Their combined particle size balances moisture and air.
[05:17.270 --> 05:19.910]  So the metric that we're really looking for here
[05:19.910 --> 05:24.910]  is that the total porosity should be equal to 50% by volume.
[05:25.430 --> 05:29.170]  And then the water holding capacity within that
[05:29.170 --> 05:31.470]  should be at least 40%.
[05:31.470 --> 05:33.510]  And then that means the air porosity
[05:33.510 --> 05:35.410]  should be at least 10%,
[05:35.410 --> 05:37.790]  because air porosity plus water holding
[05:37.790 --> 05:39.910]  equals total porosity.
[05:39.910 --> 05:41.870]  And where that 10% comes from
[05:41.870 --> 05:43.770]  is in the traditional greenhouse world,
[05:43.770 --> 05:45.670]  not necessarily the cannabis world,
[05:45.670 --> 05:48.430]  but they found below that 10%,
[05:48.430 --> 05:52.750]  there's poorer root growth and not enough oxygen
[05:52.750 --> 05:57.550]  to support a really good robust root system.
[05:57.550 --> 05:59.430]  And where that 40% comes from
[05:59.430 --> 06:01.630]  is if the lower that number is,
[06:01.630 --> 06:04.150]  the more frequently you need to irrigate your container.
[06:04.150 --> 06:06.350]  So if you were overhead watering,
[06:06.350 --> 06:08.750]  maybe you would have to water three times a day
[06:08.750 --> 06:11.590]  if you had really poor water holding capacity.
[06:13.350 --> 06:15.470]  And just an example of physical properties
[06:16.230 --> 06:19.750]  of some of the different substrate components that we use.
[06:19.750 --> 06:23.150]  Often peat by itself, peat comes in different layers
[06:23.150 --> 06:26.190]  depending on how long it's been degrading.
[06:26.190 --> 06:29.030]  And some of the kind of virgin peat that's toward the top
[06:29.030 --> 06:32.670]  that has been degraded for a less period of time
[06:32.670 --> 06:35.390]  actually could serve as a potting mix by itself.
[06:35.390 --> 06:37.590]  It has sufficient water holding
[06:37.590 --> 06:40.570]  and it has at least 10% air filled porosity.
[06:40.570 --> 06:43.230]  More often than not, we have to add perlite
[06:43.230 --> 06:47.110]  or vermiculite to peat to improve its air filled porosity.
[06:47.110 --> 06:50.070]  And then coconut core is often used
[06:50.070 --> 06:51.230]  as a material by itself.
[06:51.230 --> 06:55.230]  Coconut core also varies in how well degraded it is
[06:55.230 --> 06:57.090]  or how fibrous it is.
[06:58.030 --> 07:00.030]  But you can find many coconut cores
[07:00.030 --> 07:03.150]  that by themselves have sufficient air porosity,
[07:03.150 --> 07:05.470]  have very good water holding capacity.
[07:05.470 --> 07:09.070]  And interesting in this case, it's 95% total porosity.
[07:09.070 --> 07:12.030]  So that means when you buy that coconut core,
[07:12.030 --> 07:14.230]  you're only getting 5% by volume
[07:14.230 --> 07:16.670]  is actually that fiber that you're paying money for.
[07:16.670 --> 07:19.810]  And the rest is airspace or water space.
[07:21.470 --> 07:25.030]  So I'm gonna move on to chemical properties.
[07:25.030 --> 07:28.970]  So pH really affects the availability of nutrients
[07:28.970 --> 07:29.810]  in the root zone.
[07:29.810 --> 07:32.390]  And it's been said that about half of the nutrient disorders
[07:32.390 --> 07:35.990]  that we have are related to an improper pH
[07:35.990 --> 07:39.350]  and not due to lack of the nutrient itself.
[07:39.350 --> 07:41.670]  So this graph shows us availability
[07:42.310 --> 07:44.190]  of the different nutrients that are important to the plant
[07:44.190 --> 07:48.150]  as the pH increases from four to eight.
[07:48.150 --> 07:50.070]  And so with some of the nutrients like nitrogen
[07:50.070 --> 07:51.490]  and potassium, we're pretty lucky.
[07:51.490 --> 07:54.670]  They're actually widely available in the root zone
[07:54.670 --> 07:56.690]  across that broad pH range.
[07:56.690 --> 07:59.650]  And then we have several nutrients like phosphorus
[07:59.650 --> 08:01.350]  and then all of the micronutrients,
[08:01.350 --> 08:03.950]  iron, manganese, boron, and so on.
[08:03.950 --> 08:06.670]  We're really above a pH of about six and a half
[08:06.670 --> 08:08.430]  in a soilless media.
[08:08.430 --> 08:11.350]  Those get locked up and are not available for roots
[08:12.030 --> 08:13.870]  to take up.
[08:13.870 --> 08:15.990]  And one thing about soilless media
[08:15.990 --> 08:18.490]  is they do have less buffering capacity
[08:18.490 --> 08:20.390]  than our traditional field soils.
[08:20.390 --> 08:23.750]  So with the field soil, we could get away with a higher pH,
[08:23.750 --> 08:25.270]  but in a soilless potting mix,
[08:25.270 --> 08:28.150]  we're really looking for this more narrow range.
[08:28.150 --> 08:29.710]  On the low end of the spectrum,
[08:29.710 --> 08:33.150]  if we move below a pH of about five and a half,
[08:33.150 --> 08:36.910]  we have issues with calcium and magnesium availability.
[08:36.910 --> 08:38.270]  And at low pH,
[08:38.270 --> 08:41.690]  we can also get too high of phosphorus solubility.
[08:41.690 --> 08:44.910]  That means our phosphorus can leach out of the container
[08:44.910 --> 08:46.350]  too readily.
[08:46.350 --> 08:48.350]  So really the optimal pH we're looking for
[08:48.350 --> 08:50.150]  for hemp or cannabis in general
[08:50.150 --> 08:53.470]  is five and a half to six and a half.
[08:53.470 --> 08:58.470]  And for monitoring, we recommend targeting 5.8 to 6.2.
[08:58.590 --> 09:02.470]  And then if you're say tracking pH every week,
[09:02.470 --> 09:04.150]  which I'll talk about,
[09:04.150 --> 09:06.070]  once you track out of that range,
[09:06.070 --> 09:07.510]  you would start taking action
[09:07.510 --> 09:08.950]  so that you have some time
[09:08.950 --> 09:10.670]  before you get out of that five and a half,
[09:10.670 --> 09:11.910]  six and a half range.
[09:13.670 --> 09:17.350]  So there's several factors that affect root zone pH.
[09:17.350 --> 09:20.690]  And one is your water source itself.
[09:20.690 --> 09:23.150]  Many of our well water sources in New York
[09:23.150 --> 09:24.510]  are high in their alkalinity.
[09:24.510 --> 09:27.530]  There's limestone deposits under the earth.
[09:27.530 --> 09:31.310]  And so the carbonates and bicarbonates in that water
[09:31.310 --> 09:32.550]  are like liquid limestone.
[09:32.550 --> 09:35.110]  They essentially increase the pH of our root zone
[09:35.110 --> 09:36.050]  over time.
[09:37.050 --> 09:40.170]  And so we often see that in Western New York
[09:40.170 --> 09:41.810]  and upstate New York,
[09:41.810 --> 09:43.570]  where our well water is high in alkalinity
[09:43.570 --> 09:46.430]  and our pH is creeping up over time.
[09:46.430 --> 09:49.330]  The fertilizers that we use also affect the pH.
[09:49.330 --> 09:52.010]  So a more ammonium or urea based fertilizer
[09:52.010 --> 09:54.010]  is going to decrease the pH
[09:54.010 --> 09:56.770]  and a nitrate based fertilizer increases the pH.
[09:56.770 --> 09:58.770]  So that's actually a tool that we have to use
[09:58.770 --> 10:01.610]  to adjust pH is adjusting our fertilizer.
[10:01.610 --> 10:05.290]  And then we can also use acids to decrease pH.
[10:07.050 --> 10:11.250]  So I mentioned problems with pH being too low,
[10:11.250 --> 10:15.730]  which are especially our deficiency of calcium and magnesium
[10:15.730 --> 10:17.370]  leaching of phosphorus.
[10:17.370 --> 10:18.450]  And if we get very low,
[10:18.450 --> 10:20.990]  sometimes less than like four and a half or five,
[10:21.870 --> 10:23.930]  iron and manganese and zinc and copper
[10:23.930 --> 10:26.410]  become very available to the roots to take up.
[10:26.410 --> 10:27.910]  And we can, in some cases,
[10:27.910 --> 10:30.610]  see toxicity of those micronutrients.
[10:30.610 --> 10:32.470]  And then when pH is too high,
[10:32.470 --> 10:34.790]  which tends to be a more common problem
[10:34.830 --> 10:38.950]  with the waters that we have in upstate New York,
[10:38.950 --> 10:41.030]  we get deficiency of those micronutrients,
[10:41.030 --> 10:42.870]  iron, manganese, and so on.
[10:42.870 --> 10:46.950]  And so this is a photo of iron deficiency,
[10:46.950 --> 10:49.270]  which affects the upper leaves,
[10:49.270 --> 10:50.910]  the youngest leaves on the plant.
[10:50.910 --> 10:53.670]  And we get yellowing of those upper leaves
[10:53.670 --> 10:56.510]  starting at the base where they attach to the stem.
[10:56.510 --> 11:00.030]  And then in particular, the veins themselves will stay green,
[11:00.030 --> 11:03.510]  but the interveinal region will be lighter yellow.
[11:05.790 --> 11:07.670]  The other major chemical property
[11:07.670 --> 11:11.910]  that I wanna talk about is electrical conductivity or EC.
[11:11.910 --> 11:14.550]  And we use this as an overall measure of fertility.
[11:14.550 --> 11:18.470]  What it does is it allows us to use a handheld sensor
[11:18.470 --> 11:20.550]  to get a measure of the overall salts
[11:20.550 --> 11:21.870]  that are dissolved in water.
[11:21.870 --> 11:23.710]  And it takes advantage of the property of water
[11:23.710 --> 11:26.790]  that pure water doesn't conduct electricity,
[11:26.790 --> 11:29.370]  but water with dissolved ions in it
[11:29.370 --> 11:31.670]  can conduct more electricity.
[11:31.670 --> 11:35.030]  So a low EC indicates low overall salts
[11:35.030 --> 11:36.550]  or low overall fertility.
[11:36.550 --> 11:39.290]  And then a high EC indicates high fertility
[11:39.290 --> 11:41.390]  or overall high salts.
[11:41.390 --> 11:43.530]  With hemp, and I'll talk about testing methods,
[11:43.530 --> 11:45.910]  but with the pour-through testing method,
[11:45.910 --> 11:49.270]  we're looking for an EC reading of about one to 2.5,
[11:49.270 --> 11:51.550]  depending on the crop stage.
[11:51.550 --> 11:53.790]  And this is a photo of nitrogen deficiency,
[11:53.790 --> 11:56.710]  which we would get often with overall low fertility
[11:56.710 --> 11:59.910]  or low EC, which is lower leaf yellowing
[11:59.910 --> 12:01.350]  and small plant size.
[12:02.630 --> 12:04.870]  So we're still in our early days
[12:04.870 --> 12:09.270]  of knowing exact fertilizer recommendations for cannabis,
[12:09.270 --> 12:10.270]  that's actually, or hemp,
[12:10.270 --> 12:12.950]  that's actually one of the things that I study.
[12:12.950 --> 12:14.670]  But there's recommendations
[12:14.670 --> 12:17.710]  where we adjust the fertilizer rate.
[12:17.710 --> 12:20.110]  Often we talk about the parts per million nitrogen,
[12:20.110 --> 12:22.810]  and then the other nutrients are adjusted
[12:22.810 --> 12:24.830]  in proportion to that.
[12:24.830 --> 12:28.030]  And so at the early vegetative stage,
[12:28.030 --> 12:31.350]  during propagation, say we're at 100 to 125
[12:32.030 --> 12:33.430]  parts per million nitrogen.
[12:33.430 --> 12:36.210]  During late flowering, or late vegetative,
[12:36.210 --> 12:37.590]  and into peak flowering,
[12:37.590 --> 12:40.610]  we'll be up to about 200 parts per million nitrogen.
[12:40.610 --> 12:43.230]  And then we will cut back down on that
[12:43.230 --> 12:46.790]  about two weeks before harvest.
[12:46.790 --> 12:50.670]  So that gives us a target EC of one to 1.5,
[12:50.670 --> 12:53.170]  up to two to 2.5 during the period
[12:53.170 --> 12:55.810]  when the plant is using the most fertilizer.
[12:57.870 --> 12:59.110]  So I wanna mention briefly
[12:59.110 --> 13:00.990]  some of the in-house methods that we have.
[13:01.510 --> 13:06.510]  So if you buy a pH and EC meter for about $200 total,
[13:07.110 --> 13:08.530]  you could do either the pour through
[13:08.530 --> 13:11.070]  or the one to two dilution method.
[13:11.070 --> 13:12.870]  Those are easy to do in-house.
[13:12.870 --> 13:14.470]  And then laboratories will usually use
[13:14.470 --> 13:17.010]  the saturated media extract method,
[13:17.010 --> 13:18.910]  which is a different method.
[13:18.910 --> 13:21.990]  So you can buy handheld pH and EC pens.
[13:21.990 --> 13:24.710]  They will cost about $100 per meter.
[13:24.710 --> 13:26.830]  You wanna use a reputable brand,
[13:26.830 --> 13:28.550]  some that I've had good luck with,
[13:28.550 --> 13:29.650]  not to exclude others,
[13:29.650 --> 13:32.830]  but our Blue Lab, Hanna Instruments, and Oakton.
[13:32.830 --> 13:36.210]  Some are dual purpose, so they can measure both pH and EC.
[13:36.210 --> 13:38.010]  Be sure to check the EC unit.
[13:38.010 --> 13:39.730]  There's some different units that are used.
[13:39.730 --> 13:41.530]  I like the ones that measure EC
[13:41.530 --> 13:46.530]  and in decimals per meter instead of PPM.
[13:47.250 --> 13:50.210]  And then the pH meter needs to be calibrated
[13:50.210 --> 13:51.450]  every day that you use it.
[13:51.450 --> 13:54.730]  So you'll get a pH four and a pH seven reference solution,
[13:54.730 --> 13:56.530]  and it'll take about a minute to calibrate it
[13:56.530 --> 13:57.870]  before you use it.
[13:58.870 --> 14:00.230]  So for the pour through method,
[14:00.230 --> 14:03.630]  which is the kind of easiest non-destructive method,
[14:03.630 --> 14:05.290]  you're going to water your plants
[14:05.290 --> 14:07.470]  about an hour before taking the measurement
[14:07.470 --> 14:10.570]  so that they can get to container capacity.
[14:10.570 --> 14:14.350]  You're then gonna place a plastic saucer under the container
[14:14.350 --> 14:16.030]  and then depending on the size of the container,
[14:16.030 --> 14:17.530]  you're gonna pour a known amount
[14:17.530 --> 14:21.070]  of distilled water on top,
[14:21.070 --> 14:23.290]  and then that's gonna push out a leachate sample.
[14:23.290 --> 14:24.790]  So with a six inch pot,
[14:24.790 --> 14:27.430]  we're using about 50 milliliters of solution.
[14:27.870 --> 14:29.830]  And then you collect that leachate sample,
[14:29.830 --> 14:32.030]  and then that's what you're putting your pH
[14:32.030 --> 14:35.570]  and your EC pens into and analyzing.
[14:36.870 --> 14:38.390]  With the one to two dilution method,
[14:38.390 --> 14:39.870]  or if you send a sample to a lab
[14:39.870 --> 14:42.070]  for the saturated media extract method,
[14:42.070 --> 14:45.310]  you're taking slices or core of the media
[14:45.310 --> 14:47.190]  from where the roots are actively growing.
[14:47.190 --> 14:50.430]  So we find that salts can build up at the top surface
[14:50.430 --> 14:51.470]  as well as the bottom.
[14:51.470 --> 14:54.230]  And so we wanna take samples of soil
[14:54.230 --> 14:55.390]  from the middle of the container
[14:55.390 --> 14:57.550]  where the roots are actively growing.
[14:57.550 --> 15:00.550]  You would take samples from 10 representative plants,
[15:00.550 --> 15:02.710]  pool those samples together.
[15:02.710 --> 15:04.910]  If you're gonna send in a sample to a lab,
[15:04.910 --> 15:05.750]  talk to the lab,
[15:05.750 --> 15:08.790]  but they'll usually require one to two cups of material.
[15:08.790 --> 15:11.510]  And then if you're doing an in-house test
[15:11.510 --> 15:13.930]  for using the one to two dilution method,
[15:13.930 --> 15:17.790]  what you're gonna do is air dry that sample overnight,
[15:17.790 --> 15:21.030]  combine one part by volume of the media.
[15:21.030 --> 15:23.190]  So often I like using little Dixie cups,
[15:23.190 --> 15:24.430]  little three ounce cups.
[15:24.430 --> 15:27.250]  So we'll take a three ounce scoop of that,
[15:27.250 --> 15:30.310]  and then two cups of distilled water,
[15:30.310 --> 15:33.190]  mix thoroughly and let that stand for 30 minutes.
[15:33.190 --> 15:36.550]  And then you can use your pH and EC meter
[15:36.550 --> 15:39.430]  to test that water extract.
[15:39.430 --> 15:41.630]  This is also a really good method to use
[15:41.630 --> 15:43.150]  when testing a new potting mix.
[15:43.150 --> 15:45.790]  So if you don't have the pH and EC information
[15:45.790 --> 15:47.230]  from the manufacturer,
[15:47.230 --> 15:48.570]  you can test a new potting mix
[15:48.570 --> 15:50.590]  to make sure it's not too high in salts,
[15:50.590 --> 15:52.850]  like some of our compost-based mixes.
[15:53.210 --> 15:56.130]  And it can also tell you about the overall fertility.
[15:57.130 --> 15:59.330]  The saturated media extract would be a method
[15:59.330 --> 16:01.690]  that the laboratory uses.
[16:01.690 --> 16:03.770]  And I won't go into that too much,
[16:03.770 --> 16:06.930]  but then typically besides testing pH and EC,
[16:06.930 --> 16:08.810]  they're gonna test the individual nutrients,
[16:08.810 --> 16:10.970]  the N, P, and K, and so on.
[16:10.970 --> 16:14.810]  And so it's nice to know what your mix is at the beginning.
[16:14.810 --> 16:18.610]  And then if you have questions about fertility over time,
[16:18.610 --> 16:21.090]  you can send a media sample into the lab.
[16:21.970 --> 16:25.290]  So this in-house monitoring for pH and EC
[16:25.290 --> 16:29.250]  really is most effective if you can do it weekly,
[16:29.250 --> 16:30.650]  or at least every two weeks,
[16:30.650 --> 16:34.010]  and then graph that over time and track that over time.
[16:34.010 --> 16:35.010]  So here's an example.
[16:35.010 --> 16:37.110]  I had plants growing in containers
[16:37.110 --> 16:39.630]  with a peat perlite potting mix.
[16:39.630 --> 16:42.810]  We would sample them every seven days or so.
[16:42.810 --> 16:44.010]  We started taking action
[16:44.010 --> 16:46.530]  when we got above a pH of six and a half.
[16:46.530 --> 16:49.610]  So we switched to a more acidic fertilizer for a week.
[16:49.610 --> 16:52.930]  We did that at day 28 and it was effective.
[16:52.930 --> 16:56.170]  We started getting out of range again about 20 days later,
[16:56.170 --> 16:59.050]  and we switched to an acidic fertilizer again
[16:59.050 --> 17:00.450]  for another week.
[17:02.770 --> 17:06.970]  So overall methodology for correcting for pH.
[17:06.970 --> 17:09.290]  If your pH is testing high,
[17:09.290 --> 17:10.650]  the quick method that you have
[17:10.650 --> 17:13.770]  is to do a one-time drench with acids,
[17:13.770 --> 17:15.930]  either two ounces of sulfuric acid
[17:15.930 --> 17:18.730]  or three and a half ounces of phosphoric acid
[17:18.730 --> 17:20.330]  per 100 gallons of water.
[17:20.330 --> 17:22.850]  A lot of growers will use that through a fertilizer injector
[17:22.850 --> 17:25.130]  that's say a one to 100 injector.
[17:25.130 --> 17:27.330]  So then their stock solution would be two ounces
[17:27.330 --> 17:30.530]  of sulfuric per one gallon of stock solution.
[17:30.530 --> 17:32.830]  And then that gets diluted down to the injector
[17:32.830 --> 17:34.570]  to 100 gallons of water.
[17:34.570 --> 17:36.770]  Gradual methods to correct for a high pH
[17:36.770 --> 17:40.490]  are to switch to a more ammonium-based fertilizer,
[17:40.490 --> 17:42.450]  or if you know that your tap water source
[17:42.450 --> 17:45.410]  is high in alkalinity is to continually add
[17:45.410 --> 17:46.890]  a dilute amount of acid
[17:46.890 --> 17:48.530]  to decrease your water alkalinity
[17:48.530 --> 17:51.170]  down to 80 parts per million calcium carbonate.
[17:52.130 --> 17:56.090]  Correcting for low pH, which is less of an issue here.
[17:56.090 --> 17:58.610]  I see it more in like Long Island, for example,
[17:58.610 --> 18:00.450]  where they have very pure water.
[18:00.450 --> 18:04.330]  We can use flowable lime or potassium bicarbonate.
[18:04.330 --> 18:07.890]  You do want to follow very carefully the label instructions
[18:07.890 --> 18:10.610]  because the flowable lime,
[18:10.610 --> 18:12.370]  if it's in contact with the foliage
[18:12.370 --> 18:13.970]  can cause a burn to the leaf.
[18:13.970 --> 18:15.310]  And so you have to go back afterwards
[18:15.310 --> 18:18.990]  and mist any material off the leaves if it got on them.
[18:18.990 --> 18:22.390]  And you'll also want to flush your irrigation lines
[18:22.390 --> 18:24.230]  after using those materials.
[18:24.230 --> 18:26.030]  A more gradual method that we have
[18:26.030 --> 18:28.810]  is to switch to a more nitrate-based fertilizer.
[18:30.550 --> 18:32.270]  And then EC correction.
[18:32.270 --> 18:34.570]  So if we have a high EC,
[18:35.630 --> 18:38.070]  that means that we're either over fertilizing
[18:38.070 --> 18:42.430]  or our water source or substrate is high in salts.
[18:42.430 --> 18:45.550]  So a quick method is to leach thoroughly with tap water
[18:45.550 --> 18:49.670]  and leach so that we get about a 50% leaching fraction.
[18:49.670 --> 18:51.870]  So about half of the water that you add to each pot
[18:51.870 --> 18:54.910]  is leaching out of the bottom and do that twice.
[18:54.910 --> 18:58.510]  And that's going to reduce the EC by about half.
[18:58.510 --> 18:59.990]  The longer term control would be
[18:59.990 --> 19:02.990]  to reduce your fertilizer concentration,
[19:02.990 --> 19:06.670]  leach more frequently with a 20% leaching fraction.
[19:06.670 --> 19:08.830]  So just do that periodically
[19:08.830 --> 19:10.410]  and then test your water source
[19:10.410 --> 19:11.810]  to see if it's high in salts
[19:11.810 --> 19:13.090]  or test your substrate source
[19:13.090 --> 19:14.370]  to see if they're high in salts
[19:14.370 --> 19:16.570]  to try to identify the cause.
[19:16.570 --> 19:19.610]  Correcting a low EC essentially is an indication
[19:19.610 --> 19:21.650]  that your fertilizer strength is not high enough.
[19:21.650 --> 19:24.450]  So you need to increase your fertilizer strength
[19:24.450 --> 19:26.090]  or reduce your leaching fraction
[19:26.090 --> 19:28.770]  if you are leaching at each irrigation event.
[19:29.810 --> 19:31.310]  With that, I just wanted to point out
[19:31.310 --> 19:33.010]  a few of the commercial testing labs.
[19:33.010 --> 19:37.710]  These will all do tissue, substrate, and water analysis.
[19:37.710 --> 19:42.630]  The cost tends to vary from about $30 to $45.
[19:42.630 --> 19:44.510]  And I find that growers typically,
[19:44.510 --> 19:48.470]  once they find a lab that works well for them,
[19:48.470 --> 19:49.830]  they tend to stick with that lab
[19:49.830 --> 19:52.710]  because every lab's results will be a little bit different,
[19:52.710 --> 19:53.550]  which is kind of funny,
[19:53.550 --> 19:54.870]  but they're like,
[19:54.870 --> 19:57.170]  if you want to do an apples to apples comparison,
[19:57.170 --> 19:59.550]  you typically stick with a given lab
[19:59.550 --> 20:01.390]  after a certain point in time.
[20:01.390 --> 20:03.070]  Some of these labs, for example,
[20:03.070 --> 20:04.630]  I know for sure that J.R. Peters
[20:04.630 --> 20:09.630]  and Macro Micro Laboratory will do tissue hemp analysis
[20:09.990 --> 20:13.990]  and they have sufficiency ranges
[20:13.990 --> 20:15.710]  that the laboratory can give you
[20:15.710 --> 20:18.570]  for what percent nitrogen should be in the leaves,
[20:18.570 --> 20:21.630]  for example, based on the stage that you're at.
[20:21.630 --> 20:23.430]  All right, with that, I will end
[20:23.430 --> 20:26.230]  and we'll see if Larry gives us any time for questions.
[20:26.230 --> 20:30.950]  Yeah, thanks very much, Neil.
[20:30.950 --> 20:34.310]  Unfortunately, we're going to try to get back on schedule.
[20:35.070 --> 20:37.110]  And in particular,
[20:37.110 --> 20:40.550]  Neil did not talk about all of his expertise in lighting.
[20:41.630 --> 20:43.790]  So if you have questions about lighting,
[20:43.790 --> 20:46.190]  also catch up with Neil.
[20:46.190 --> 20:49.090]  He is an encyclopedia of knowledge.
[20:56.550 --> 21:00.030]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[21:00.030 --> 21:02.870]  on the web at cornell.edu.
