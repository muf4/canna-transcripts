[00:00.000 --> 00:07.050]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.050 --> 00:09.590]  OK, so what's going to happen if you weren't here this morning?
[00:09.590 --> 00:14.670]  Savannah Shelna is a graduate student in Larry Smart's lab.
[00:14.670 --> 00:15.650]  This is her trial.
[00:15.650 --> 00:17.470]  It's a poverty and mildew trial.
[00:17.470 --> 00:19.230]  So since it's a trial, we ask that you not
[00:19.230 --> 00:21.590]  take any plant material off of the plant
[00:21.590 --> 00:23.070]  so she can do her work.
[00:23.070 --> 00:25.390]  But I think if we go inside, we can
[00:25.390 --> 00:27.350]  look at some of the things we're talking about.
[00:27.350 --> 00:28.970]  And I'm going to talk about bugs today.
[00:28.970 --> 00:33.190]  So let's make our way inside the high tunnel.
[00:33.190 --> 00:38.110]  OK, welcome inside the high tunnel here.
[00:38.110 --> 00:41.870]  Real quick, in case you weren't here this morning,
[00:41.870 --> 00:43.750]  high tunnel is a soil-based greenhouse.
[00:43.750 --> 00:45.710]  And it kind of brings, hopefully,
[00:45.710 --> 00:48.550]  the best of both worlds of field production
[00:48.550 --> 00:52.350]  in that we're using the soil as our substrate,
[00:52.350 --> 00:53.910]  our growing media.
[00:53.910 --> 00:58.110]  But at the same time, versus hydroponic, at the same time,
[00:58.110 --> 00:59.910]  we're getting those greenhouse benefits
[00:59.910 --> 01:04.070]  of controlling the environment to some degree.
[01:04.070 --> 01:08.230]  Since we are using the soil, and it's a lower technology
[01:08.230 --> 01:13.430]  greenhouse, we are going to probably have more insect pests
[01:13.430 --> 01:16.550]  than might happen outside just because we have the soil here.
[01:16.550 --> 01:18.670]  Excuse me, yeah, more than outside,
[01:18.670 --> 01:20.830]  because we also don't have rain.
[01:20.830 --> 01:23.030]  So the ventilation is an important feature
[01:23.030 --> 01:28.350]  on, I think, any greenhouse, high tunnels in particular.
[01:28.350 --> 01:31.030]  We use these roll-up sides so that we have air exchange.
[01:31.030 --> 01:34.470]  That air exchange is critical for any crop grown indoors.
[01:34.470 --> 01:35.870]  It gets more CO2.
[01:35.870 --> 01:39.110]  Plants use sunlight and CO2 to photosynthesize.
[01:39.110 --> 01:42.110]  So that air replenishment is important for CO2,
[01:42.110 --> 01:45.790]  relative humidity, and temperature management as well.
[01:45.790 --> 01:47.750]  It also means that insects can come in and out
[01:47.750 --> 01:49.830]  through those open sidewalls.
[01:49.830 --> 01:51.470]  So we're clear on that.
[01:51.470 --> 01:56.070]  So to control those insects, we have
[01:56.070 --> 02:00.030]  to think about what are we going to do to do that.
[02:00.030 --> 02:01.910]  I'm going to suggest that we look away
[02:01.910 --> 02:04.830]  from what we call conventional pesticides for a few reasons,
[02:04.830 --> 02:06.670]  hopefully that are obvious to all of you.
[02:06.670 --> 02:08.510]  One is the testing that we just heard
[02:08.510 --> 02:10.150]  about in our previous talk.
[02:10.150 --> 02:12.870]  If you're applying a conventional pesticide
[02:12.870 --> 02:17.790]  to these plants, that might ruin your testing.
[02:17.790 --> 02:19.750]  The next is it's probably illegal.
[02:19.750 --> 02:23.190]  So we don't have what we call traditional conventional
[02:23.190 --> 02:27.550]  pesticides that are labeled for cannabis, let alone inside.
[02:27.550 --> 02:29.630]  Because many of your pesticides that are registered outside
[02:29.630 --> 02:30.990]  are not registered inside.
[02:30.990 --> 02:32.510]  That means we need to look at other ways
[02:32.510 --> 02:34.750]  of controlling these pests.
[02:34.750 --> 02:38.710]  I'm going to talk about introducing good bugs
[02:38.710 --> 02:40.430]  to control the bad bugs.
[02:40.430 --> 02:43.870]  And we call that biocontrol.
[02:43.870 --> 02:45.390]  Or, yeah, biocontrol.
[02:45.390 --> 02:47.730]  There is another way to do that as well.
[02:47.730 --> 02:52.590]  And just as you can use what we call microbial fungicides,
[02:52.590 --> 02:55.750]  so in the talk that we just heard from Chris's grad student
[02:55.750 --> 02:58.390]  where you're spraying either a bacterium or a fungus
[02:58.390 --> 03:02.950]  onto the plant with the idea of controlling the pest disease,
[03:02.950 --> 03:06.390]  you can do the same with insects using microbials.
[03:06.390 --> 03:07.670]  I'm not going to talk about that.
[03:07.670 --> 03:09.790]  I'm going to talk about releasing the good bugs
[03:09.790 --> 03:16.510]  into control the bad bugs.
[03:16.510 --> 03:20.610]  So I'm using the word bugs instead of insects
[03:20.610 --> 03:22.990]  because we're not just dealing with insects,
[03:22.990 --> 03:24.750]  we're also dealing with mites.
[03:24.750 --> 03:26.050]  You may have heard of mites.
[03:26.050 --> 03:27.350]  Mites are insects.
[03:27.350 --> 03:29.110]  They have eight legs.
[03:29.110 --> 03:32.630]  There's a very common pest of cannabis called two-spotted
[03:32.630 --> 03:33.930]  spider mite.
[03:33.930 --> 03:35.710]  We heard about that earlier today too.
[03:35.710 --> 03:37.250]  That's a pest mite.
[03:37.250 --> 03:39.470]  The reality is there's probably more beneficial mites
[03:39.470 --> 03:40.910]  than there are pest mites.
[03:40.910 --> 03:44.310]  So we actually use good mites and good insects
[03:44.310 --> 03:48.030]  to control the bad bugs, the bad mites and the bad insects.
[03:48.030 --> 03:50.150]  So I'm going to say bugs as a general overall term
[03:50.150 --> 03:51.870]  to include both mites and insects.
[03:54.390 --> 03:57.870]  Another reason you might want to look at introducing good bugs
[03:57.870 --> 04:01.190]  into these high tunnels or greenhouses
[04:01.190 --> 04:02.690]  is if you want to do things organic.
[04:02.690 --> 04:04.190]  So if you have a product that you're
[04:04.190 --> 04:06.910]  representing in some fashion as organic,
[04:06.910 --> 04:09.550]  this is the way to approach that.
[04:09.550 --> 04:13.270]  The other benefit with introducing good bugs
[04:13.270 --> 04:16.110]  here is that it's less labor than spraying anything,
[04:16.110 --> 04:19.310]  whether that's an organic spray or a conventional spray.
[04:19.310 --> 04:22.030]  Releasing insects is less work, I find, than spraying.
[04:25.670 --> 04:27.930]  So how do we know what to release?
[04:27.930 --> 04:29.390]  Well, the first thing we have to do
[04:29.390 --> 04:31.630]  is figure out what we are releasing for.
[04:31.630 --> 04:33.950]  What are we going to introduce a good bug for?
[04:33.950 --> 04:35.470]  That means we're going to scout.
[04:35.470 --> 04:37.990]  And to scout, approach one of these beautiful plants
[04:37.990 --> 04:42.630]  next to you and start poking around that foliage.
[04:42.630 --> 04:43.830]  You're free to do that.
[04:43.830 --> 04:45.550]  Savannah, it's OK if they handle the plants.
[04:45.550 --> 04:46.230]  Is that correct?
[04:46.230 --> 04:47.990]  She says totally.
[04:48.030 --> 04:49.670]  Totally.
[04:49.670 --> 04:51.510]  Get in there and poke around a little bit.
[04:51.510 --> 04:56.390]  And what I like to do when I'm looking for insects and mites,
[04:56.390 --> 04:58.150]  I tend to start at the bottom of the plant,
[04:58.150 --> 05:01.190]  particularly in a high tunnel where we're using soil.
[05:01.190 --> 05:04.670]  And that soil or dust oftentimes is
[05:04.670 --> 05:06.950]  what gets these insects going.
[05:06.950 --> 05:09.430]  So I take a look at those lower leaves
[05:09.430 --> 05:11.550]  and I figure out what do I have going on there.
[05:11.550 --> 05:14.070]  I'm not going to go through that whole exercise.
[05:14.070 --> 05:15.390]  That's generally where I start.
[05:15.390 --> 05:17.310]  Not all of your pests will start on the bottom,
[05:17.310 --> 05:19.150]  but it's a very good place to start looking.
[05:19.150 --> 05:20.850]  And if you look at these cannabis plants,
[05:20.850 --> 05:25.910]  you will find some insect pests low down in the canopy.
[05:25.910 --> 05:29.150]  Now that I've figured out what I've got,
[05:29.150 --> 05:30.650]  well, you haven't figured that out.
[05:30.650 --> 05:31.870]  You figured out you've got something.
[05:31.870 --> 05:32.510]  It's a mite.
[05:32.510 --> 05:33.110]  It's an aphid.
[05:33.110 --> 05:34.230]  It's a thrips.
[05:34.230 --> 05:34.950]  It's a beetle.
[05:34.950 --> 05:36.030]  It's a worm.
[05:36.030 --> 05:37.350]  It's something.
[05:37.350 --> 05:42.230]  You need to figure out is there a beneficial insect or mite
[05:42.230 --> 05:45.190]  that will control that for me.
[05:45.190 --> 05:50.510]  And so I work with a couple of different biocontrol suppliers
[05:50.510 --> 05:53.870]  that are outstanding sources of information.
[05:53.870 --> 05:58.430]  I have one here from Arbico and one from Coppert.
[05:58.430 --> 06:00.630]  And these people are used to working with the cannabis
[06:00.630 --> 06:01.590]  industry.
[06:01.590 --> 06:03.350]  They have a lot of information on what
[06:03.350 --> 06:07.190]  are the good bugs that you put in to control the bad bugs.
[06:07.190 --> 06:10.510]  So a brief word on the good bugs.
[06:10.510 --> 06:12.430]  Again, we're dealing with beneficial mites
[06:12.430 --> 06:13.670]  and beneficial insects.
[06:13.670 --> 06:16.190]  We divide those into two major categories.
[06:16.190 --> 06:19.510]  They can either be parasitoids or predators.
[06:19.510 --> 06:22.710]  A parasitoid doesn't eat the bad bug.
[06:22.710 --> 06:24.910]  It somehow disrupts its life cycle.
[06:24.910 --> 06:28.030]  So parasitoid wasps are the common example of that.
[06:28.030 --> 06:31.150]  They lay an egg inside of an aphid.
[06:31.150 --> 06:34.070]  And then that egg grows, and then a wasp
[06:34.070 --> 06:35.190]  emerges from the aphid.
[06:35.190 --> 06:36.710]  It's pretty neat.
[06:36.710 --> 06:38.270]  That's a parasitoid.
[06:38.270 --> 06:42.230]  Their relationship with the pest is often highly specific.
[06:42.230 --> 06:45.790]  So they might only lay eggs inside of one species of aphid
[06:45.790 --> 06:48.310]  or maybe two or three species of aphids.
[06:48.310 --> 06:51.270]  For that reason, I tend to prefer
[06:51.270 --> 06:53.350]  what I call generalist predators.
[06:53.350 --> 06:59.350]  Predators that eat are bad bugs, and they'll eat many of them.
[06:59.350 --> 07:01.270]  So if we look at aphids, we not only
[07:01.270 --> 07:04.150]  have the hemp aphid that affects cannabis.
[07:04.150 --> 07:06.550]  We also have hop aphids that will affect cannabis.
[07:06.550 --> 07:07.630]  You have foxglove aphid.
[07:07.630 --> 07:13.870]  You have potato aphid.
[07:13.870 --> 07:14.430]  Lots of them.
[07:14.430 --> 07:15.830]  Green peach aphid.
[07:15.830 --> 07:17.830]  And so I prefer a generalist predator
[07:17.830 --> 07:18.790]  that eats all of those.
[07:18.790 --> 07:20.670]  It doesn't care what it eats.
[07:20.670 --> 07:24.030]  And so I'm going to highlight one of those here.
[07:24.030 --> 07:26.430]  This is a green lacewing larvae.
[07:26.430 --> 07:28.350]  And if you look at the picture on this bottle,
[07:28.350 --> 07:29.970]  you'll see what that larvae looks like.
[07:29.970 --> 07:31.670]  It looks like a monster.
[07:31.670 --> 07:34.630]  This thing is a monster if you're an aphid.
[07:34.630 --> 07:38.070]  Lacewings are these beautiful green flying insects
[07:38.070 --> 07:40.870]  in their adult stage with a very lacy wing.
[07:40.870 --> 07:45.070]  And what they do is they fly around this high tunnel.
[07:45.070 --> 07:47.910]  They sense where the aphids have their colonies.
[07:47.910 --> 07:50.150]  And then they lay an egg in the center of that colony.
[07:50.150 --> 07:52.950]  Not inside an aphid, but in the middle of that colony.
[07:52.950 --> 07:55.750]  That egg hatches out, and then this lacewing larvae
[07:55.750 --> 07:58.030]  comes out, and it voraciously goes
[07:58.030 --> 08:00.310]  after any aphid I could find.
[08:00.310 --> 08:02.150]  So I really like this one because it
[08:02.150 --> 08:05.870]  combines two important assets for me in biocontrol.
[08:05.870 --> 08:07.990]  One is general predation.
[08:07.990 --> 08:10.150]  So it eats almost any species of aphid.
[08:10.150 --> 08:11.750]  It eats many species of aphids.
[08:11.750 --> 08:13.150]  And it also has mobility.
[08:13.150 --> 08:14.390]  It flies.
[08:14.390 --> 08:16.230]  And it detects where those hot spots
[08:16.230 --> 08:18.950]  are inside of the high tunnel.
[08:18.950 --> 08:20.190]  So I'll pass this around.
[08:20.190 --> 08:22.710]  You can see that those are commercially available.
[08:22.710 --> 08:25.230]  You buy that, sprinkle it out into your crop.
[08:28.470 --> 08:30.950]  Actually, lacewing larvae are going
[08:30.950 --> 08:35.070]  to come probably in their larval stage.
[08:35.070 --> 08:37.910]  This is another wasp.
[08:37.910 --> 08:39.070]  The lacewing's not a wasp.
[08:39.070 --> 08:41.270]  It's another flying insect.
[08:41.270 --> 08:42.590]  This is a wasp.
[08:42.590 --> 08:43.950]  It's not a parasitoid wasp.
[08:43.950 --> 08:45.710]  It's another generalist.
[08:45.710 --> 08:48.030]  So this is aphidolides.
[08:48.030 --> 08:51.390]  And it, again, seeks out where are the aphids.
[08:51.390 --> 08:52.470]  And it lays eggs.
[08:52.470 --> 08:54.950]  And it goes out and consumes those eggs.
[08:54.950 --> 08:58.910]  Both of these fantastic generalist predators for aphids.
[08:58.910 --> 09:01.310]  For spider mites and thrips, we don't
[09:01.310 --> 09:02.950]  have that flying advantage.
[09:02.950 --> 09:06.870]  In that case, our predators have to be shaken out.
[09:06.870 --> 09:11.350]  And they'll come in a sawdust carrier or vermiculite carrier,
[09:11.350 --> 09:12.550]  just like that.
[09:12.550 --> 09:15.590]  And I would sprinkle that out into my crop.
[09:15.590 --> 09:17.150]  And they would seek their prey.
[09:17.150 --> 09:19.630]  Some of the common ones we would use for mites,
[09:19.630 --> 09:21.470]  their names, you don't have to memorize them,
[09:21.470 --> 09:23.870]  would be persimilis, californicus.
[09:23.870 --> 09:28.030]  For thrips, we use a beneficial mite called cucumaris.
[09:28.030 --> 09:29.310]  Again, you don't have to learn Latin.
[09:29.310 --> 09:31.190]  You don't have to memorize those things.
[09:31.190 --> 09:33.470]  Talk with your biocontrol provider.
[09:33.470 --> 09:37.150]  They can walk you through that process really well.
[09:37.150 --> 09:42.190]  Now I've got in front of me about 3,000 square feet
[09:42.190 --> 09:42.750]  savanna.
[09:42.750 --> 09:45.230]  Is this 30 by 96, maybe?
[09:45.230 --> 09:49.710]  OK, so about 3,000 square feet of growing space.
[09:49.710 --> 09:57.150]  This container has probably around 500 or 1,000
[09:57.150 --> 10:00.030]  of these wasps inside that are going to emerge and hopefully
[10:00.030 --> 10:01.790]  find my aphids.
[10:01.790 --> 10:06.110]  A much preferable way to get this product onto my crop,
[10:06.110 --> 10:09.430]  instead of treating these 3,000 square feet,
[10:09.430 --> 10:12.110]  is to treat my transplant area.
[10:12.110 --> 10:16.510]  So these 3,000 square feet of hemp plants,
[10:16.510 --> 10:18.870]  when they're small, are condensed into maybe 100
[10:18.870 --> 10:21.030]  square feet on a greenhouse bench.
[10:21.030 --> 10:23.830]  So I can treat that greenhouse bench with this.
[10:23.830 --> 10:26.550]  And then once I transplant out into my high tunnel,
[10:26.550 --> 10:28.990]  ideally those plants are pre-inoculated
[10:28.990 --> 10:31.190]  with the beneficial.
[10:31.190 --> 10:33.030]  So when do we treat?
[10:33.030 --> 10:34.630]  We treat early.
[10:34.630 --> 10:36.270]  How often do we treat?
[10:36.270 --> 10:38.070]  That depends on the pest, but we're probably
[10:38.070 --> 10:39.710]  going to treat often.
[10:39.710 --> 10:44.030]  If you're going to go this route, this biocontrol route,
[10:44.030 --> 10:45.430]  scouting is important.
[10:45.430 --> 10:48.230]  But I think it's more important to release early.
[10:48.230 --> 10:49.790]  You have to commit to this and say,
[10:49.790 --> 10:52.390]  I'm going to go this route, and I'm going to release.
[10:52.390 --> 10:54.790]  If you're growing indoors, it's a hot, dry environment.
[10:54.790 --> 10:57.230]  You're very likely to have the pests we mentioned today,
[10:57.230 --> 10:58.990]  mites, thrips, aphids.
[10:58.990 --> 11:01.510]  Assume that you're going to have them, and be prepared
[11:01.510 --> 11:02.590]  and release these early.
[11:05.470 --> 11:09.630]  There's no more words left on my highly sophisticated notes.
[11:09.630 --> 11:11.710]  Questions, comments, rebuttals?
[11:16.070 --> 11:16.570]  Yeah?
[11:16.570 --> 11:20.910]  Is this layout here, is this just for trials?
[11:20.910 --> 11:26.230]  Or would you say that this is standard for most pipelines?
[11:26.230 --> 11:29.150]  I would say it's for trials, but maybe Savannah's not here.
[11:29.150 --> 11:29.830]  I'm right here.
[11:29.830 --> 11:31.530]  Yeah, you want to address that, Savannah?
[11:31.530 --> 11:34.550]  Yeah, this is just specifically for this trial.
[11:34.550 --> 11:37.230]  I'll address why we chose this layout a little bit more
[11:37.230 --> 11:37.750]  in a second.
[11:37.750 --> 11:39.830]  Yeah, will you cover density?
[11:39.830 --> 11:40.990]  You can talk about density.
[11:40.990 --> 11:43.310]  If you want to, I'll explain and talk to you about it.
[11:43.310 --> 11:45.150]  Yeah, I don't know much about density,
[11:45.150 --> 11:47.110]  but I would say we're at sub-optimal density.
[11:47.110 --> 11:49.270]  So part of my talk this morning is
[11:49.270 --> 11:52.190]  focused on this greenhouse really
[11:52.190 --> 11:56.830]  needs to produce as much cannabinoid flour as it
[11:56.830 --> 11:59.870]  can to justify the investment in the steel and plastic
[11:59.870 --> 12:02.070]  versus growing this in the field.
[12:02.070 --> 12:03.870]  So for that reason, we want to find
[12:03.870 --> 12:06.430]  what is that optimal density.
[12:06.430 --> 12:08.770]  And I'd say we're well below it at this point.
[12:08.770 --> 12:11.350]  Maybe there's a grower in the room who has an idea on density
[12:11.350 --> 12:11.950]  in square feet.
[12:15.510 --> 12:16.150]  No?
[12:16.150 --> 12:17.110]  Is that a trade secret?
[12:17.110 --> 12:17.610]  Go ahead.
[12:17.610 --> 12:18.110]  Sure.
[12:19.910 --> 12:23.190]  So can you rotate these biologicals
[12:23.190 --> 12:27.950]  with low-risk pesticides like BT?
[12:27.950 --> 12:31.990]  So the question is, can you rotate these biologicals
[12:31.990 --> 12:35.590]  with low-risk pesticides like BT?
[12:35.590 --> 12:40.310]  So BT, for those who don't know, is a naturally occurring,
[12:40.310 --> 12:43.830]  it's a toxin that comes from a bacterium that specifically
[12:43.830 --> 12:48.190]  targets a set of worms.
[12:48.190 --> 12:53.390]  And probably has low activity against many of the species
[12:53.390 --> 12:54.830]  that we're targeting.
[12:54.830 --> 12:56.630]  If you go to the biocontrol websites,
[12:56.630 --> 12:58.750]  they generally show a compatibility chart
[12:58.750 --> 13:03.270]  of does this biocontrol mix well with, say,
[13:03.270 --> 13:04.670]  a BT or another pesticide.
[13:08.230 --> 13:11.270]  My approach would be to go with one or the other on that.
[13:11.270 --> 13:13.390]  Because in the end, you are applying an insecticide
[13:13.390 --> 13:14.830]  when you're using a BT.
[13:14.830 --> 13:18.990]  And it's probably going to have some negative effect,
[13:18.990 --> 13:21.270]  particularly on soft-bodied beneficials
[13:21.270 --> 13:23.590]  that I'm releasing in here.
[13:23.590 --> 13:25.910]  So knowing that I'm going to control multiple species,
[13:25.910 --> 13:29.710]  I'm going to need multiple predators.
[13:29.710 --> 13:31.550]  And I would let them do their work.
[13:31.550 --> 13:33.510]  Do you mind if I soapbox for a moment?
[13:33.510 --> 13:35.270]  I'd be happy to be soapboxed.
[13:35.270 --> 13:37.150]  But it depends on the topic, Steve.
[13:37.150 --> 13:38.750]  I'll try to keep the commercial short.
[13:38.750 --> 13:40.590]  Hi, I'm the rep for Marone Bio.
[13:40.590 --> 13:42.630]  We sell Grandivo and Venerate.
[13:42.630 --> 13:44.670]  They are two biopesticides.
[13:45.510 --> 13:46.910]  The two biopesticides.
[13:46.910 --> 13:50.350]  Going to your question about compatibility,
[13:50.350 --> 13:52.910]  we've been in the cannabis sector
[13:52.910 --> 13:54.390]  since the very beginning.
[13:54.390 --> 13:58.470]  And we use them quite a bit for managing Western flower
[13:58.470 --> 14:00.830]  thrips, all the species of aphids, spider mites,
[14:00.830 --> 14:02.750]  broad mites, et cetera.
[14:02.750 --> 14:05.950]  I like them a lot in a BCA program.
[14:05.950 --> 14:08.510]  And part of one of your evaluation points
[14:08.510 --> 14:11.190]  is you're looking at how to integrate all this mess.
[14:11.190 --> 14:13.070]  One of the things I like about BTs,
[14:13.110 --> 14:15.430]  although they're specific to caterpillars,
[14:15.430 --> 14:19.510]  is the mode of entry into an insect is by ingestion.
[14:19.510 --> 14:22.270]  Most, well, all of our beneficials
[14:22.270 --> 14:23.550]  are not eating your plant.
[14:23.550 --> 14:25.310]  That's what makes them beneficial.
[14:25.310 --> 14:29.390]  And so you're very unlikely with a BT or a Grandivo
[14:29.390 --> 14:32.030]  or a Venerate to actually get any in.
[14:32.030 --> 14:35.150]  And then the mode of action of them is as a stomach poison.
[14:35.150 --> 14:36.590]  So this goes back to,
[14:36.590 --> 14:41.590]  if your beneficials are not eating your plants,
[14:41.910 --> 14:44.430]  there's no way they're gonna get any of this product in here.
[14:44.430 --> 14:46.630]  So you can't integrate the two.
[14:46.630 --> 14:51.110]  I find that the whole industry, the whole BCA industry
[14:51.110 --> 14:54.270]  cropped up when there were no biopesticides.
[14:54.270 --> 14:56.990]  Now we have a whole lot of biopesticides.
[14:56.990 --> 15:00.190]  Integrating them, I think, is the real challenge.
[15:00.190 --> 15:03.150]  I'm talking not just my company, Biopesticides,
[15:03.150 --> 15:04.870]  but even though we hate to admit it,
[15:04.870 --> 15:07.630]  there are other biopesticides out there.
[15:07.630 --> 15:10.030]  I see a BioSafe rep back there.
[15:10.270 --> 15:12.830]  And their products are almost as good as ours.
[15:14.110 --> 15:16.110]  Thank you all very much.
[15:16.110 --> 15:18.710]  Yes, thank you for those unbiased comments, Steve.
[15:20.150 --> 15:22.990]  Steve from BioScience is one of our sponsors today.
[15:22.990 --> 15:24.270]  I encourage you to talk to Steve.
[15:24.270 --> 15:27.430]  He's been in the high tunnel and protected crop
[15:27.430 --> 15:31.030]  and outdoor crop world for almost as long as I have been.
[15:31.030 --> 15:32.950]  So a lot of knowledge there.
[15:32.950 --> 15:35.070]  One more quick thought that comes to mind for me
[15:35.070 --> 15:37.470]  is I look at this high tunnel,
[15:37.470 --> 15:39.190]  and as much as I love soil,
[15:39.230 --> 15:41.230]  I don't always wanna see the soil.
[15:41.230 --> 15:44.830]  So if this were a commercial production for me,
[15:44.830 --> 15:46.670]  I would mulch this one way or another.
[15:46.670 --> 15:49.670]  Either mulch these row middles with a plastic film,
[15:49.670 --> 15:52.030]  and there are degradable films you can use today,
[15:52.030 --> 15:54.350]  or with an organic mulch,
[15:54.350 --> 15:56.430]  such as straw or something like that.
[15:56.430 --> 15:59.350]  That alone is gonna provide a lot of benefits
[15:59.350 --> 16:00.390]  on insect control.
[16:00.390 --> 16:01.990]  It's also gonna provide moisture control.
[16:01.990 --> 16:04.590]  It's also gonna provide weed control.
[16:04.590 --> 16:07.430]  And it's also a nicer working environment for your labor
[16:07.430 --> 16:09.750]  when they're in here doing whatever they're doing.
[16:09.750 --> 16:12.990]  So quick, easy way to control pests
[16:12.990 --> 16:15.930]  or to reduce your pest load is to mulch these row middles.
[16:18.030 --> 16:19.390]  More questions or comments?
[16:20.510 --> 16:21.590]  Behind me?
[16:21.590 --> 16:22.430]  Yeah.
[16:22.430 --> 16:24.790]  You mentioned bio-controls.
[16:24.790 --> 16:25.630]  Sorry, Mary.
[16:26.830 --> 16:27.670]  I'll repeat it, go ahead.
[16:27.670 --> 16:28.710]  Bio-controls.
[16:28.710 --> 16:31.510]  Do I need a pesticide applicator's license for bio-controls,
[16:31.510 --> 16:35.110]  and what about these bio, you know, actual pesticides?
[16:35.110 --> 16:38.630]  Right, so Marie Ulrich from Orange County asks,
[16:38.630 --> 16:42.550]  do I need a license to apply either microbial products
[16:42.550 --> 16:43.910]  or beneficial insects?
[16:43.910 --> 16:45.630]  And the answer is no, you don't.
[16:45.630 --> 16:47.310]  So there's another set of paperwork
[16:47.310 --> 16:48.150]  you don't have to go through,
[16:48.150 --> 16:50.230]  which you don't have to jump through.
[16:50.230 --> 16:52.210]  And again, if you look at that OCM webpage,
[16:52.210 --> 16:53.750]  they're really encouraging you
[16:53.750 --> 16:56.710]  to be as organic as possible.
[16:56.710 --> 17:00.250]  That said, whenever you use a labeled pesticide,
[17:00.250 --> 17:02.130]  as a farmer in New York State,
[17:02.130 --> 17:05.490]  you are required to keep a record of that.
[17:05.490 --> 17:08.450]  How much product did you use, and when did you use it?
[17:08.450 --> 17:09.950]  And even the organic materials
[17:09.950 --> 17:12.330]  do have what we call re-entry intervals,
[17:12.330 --> 17:13.710]  and you have to respect those.
[17:13.710 --> 17:15.690]  And they have PPE requirements,
[17:15.690 --> 17:17.210]  in other words, you have to wear certain clothing
[17:17.210 --> 17:18.810]  or protective equipment.
[17:18.810 --> 17:19.730]  So.
[17:19.730 --> 17:21.290]  Worker protection standards.
[17:22.530 --> 17:25.350]  And are subject to worker protection standards.
[17:25.350 --> 17:27.150]  Mary loves talking about this stuff.
[17:28.130 --> 17:30.010]  She's the one to go to when you have questions
[17:30.010 --> 17:32.650]  on legal things.
[17:32.650 --> 17:34.150]  I'm good for other questions.
[17:35.650 --> 17:37.090]  Thoughts, comments?
[17:37.090 --> 17:39.210]  If not, I'm probably at the end of my time.
[17:44.220 --> 17:47.700]  This has been a production of Cornell University.
[17:47.700 --> 17:50.520]  On the web at cornell.edu.
