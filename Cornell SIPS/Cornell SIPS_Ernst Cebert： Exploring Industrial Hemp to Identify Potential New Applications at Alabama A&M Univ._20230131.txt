[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.710 --> 00:09.550]  Hi everyone.
[00:09.550 --> 00:12.350]  Welcome to the 2023 HEMP webinar series.
[00:13.450 --> 00:15.850]  It's nice to see you all back here.
[00:15.850 --> 00:17.390]  My name is Luis Monserrate.
[00:17.390 --> 00:20.470]  I'm a second year PhD student in plant breeding and genetics
[00:20.470 --> 00:23.350]  in Larry Smarr's lab at Cornell University.
[00:23.350 --> 00:26.310]  And I organized in this webinar with the help of a,
[00:26.310 --> 00:30.470]  called, excuse me, a Cornell alum, Tony Baracco,
[00:30.470 --> 00:33.090]  who you can see here in the video.
[00:33.090 --> 00:34.650]  First of all, I would like to acknowledge
[00:34.650 --> 00:38.050]  the amazing work and help of Kim,
[00:38.050 --> 00:40.690]  who put all of this digital infrastructure together
[00:40.690 --> 00:43.690]  for all of us to have this great webinar today.
[00:43.690 --> 00:44.990]  So thank you so much, Kim.
[00:46.170 --> 00:48.490]  Before we get started, there are a few orders of business
[00:48.490 --> 00:49.490]  I would like to cover.
[00:49.490 --> 00:53.310]  So please be patient with me.
[00:53.310 --> 00:57.410]  So there will be two buttons that you'll be using
[00:57.410 --> 01:02.410]  along this talk, as well as in the next webinars.
[01:03.050 --> 01:06.290]  There is a Q&A button and the chat button.
[01:06.290 --> 01:08.970]  Please make sure to use the Q&A button
[01:08.970 --> 01:11.690]  to enter your questions for a speaker.
[01:11.690 --> 01:14.730]  And for any other kind of dialogue
[01:14.730 --> 01:16.850]  that you would like to have with other attendees
[01:16.850 --> 01:20.770]  or with the speakers or with us,
[01:20.770 --> 01:22.130]  please use the chat button.
[01:23.450 --> 01:27.410]  Lastly, I wanna point out that this webinar series
[01:27.410 --> 01:30.210]  has a slight twist this year.
[01:30.210 --> 01:32.330]  Each of these webinars is a component
[01:32.330 --> 01:34.210]  of eight educational modules.
[01:34.210 --> 01:37.890]  So each module will consist of a recorded webinar,
[01:37.890 --> 01:39.330]  which is one of them,
[01:39.330 --> 01:41.570]  probably the one that you are seeing right now,
[01:41.570 --> 01:44.170]  an instruction and a slide deck
[01:44.170 --> 01:45.650]  with more of a teaching style
[01:45.650 --> 01:49.090]  that will be developed by the speaker
[01:50.290 --> 01:52.370]  and a set of high impact papers
[01:52.370 --> 01:56.730]  pertaining to the respective subject of educational module.
[01:56.730 --> 01:58.490]  So in this case, this educational module
[01:58.530 --> 02:00.770]  is called Botany and Physiology.
[02:00.770 --> 02:04.650]  These modules will be freely available, sorry,
[02:04.650 --> 02:06.330]  on the Cornell Hemp website
[02:06.330 --> 02:08.130]  and at the end of the webinar series
[02:08.130 --> 02:12.330]  for anyone interested in re-watching this webinar series
[02:12.330 --> 02:14.970]  or interested in learning more about hemp in general.
[02:17.090 --> 02:20.730]  Anyway, so with that, allow me to introduce the speaker.
[02:20.730 --> 02:23.210]  Today's speaker is Dr. Ernst Sievert.
[02:23.210 --> 02:25.330]  He's a research associate professor
[02:25.330 --> 02:28.210]  in the Department of Biological Environmental Sciences
[02:28.890 --> 02:30.930]  at Alabama A&M University.
[02:30.930 --> 02:33.050]  And the topic of his talk today
[02:33.050 --> 02:35.650]  is exploring industrial hemp
[02:35.650 --> 02:37.690]  to identify potential new applications
[02:37.690 --> 02:40.130]  at Alabama A&M University.
[02:40.130 --> 02:43.010]  So without further ado, please Dr. Sievert, take it away.
[02:44.290 --> 02:46.530]  Okay, thank you.
[02:47.650 --> 02:49.450]  Louis, why don't you give me a thumbs up
[02:49.450 --> 02:51.330]  if you can hear me very well?
[02:51.330 --> 02:52.210]  Well, very good.
[02:52.210 --> 02:53.050]  Thank you.
[02:53.970 --> 02:56.570]  Good afternoon, everyone.
[02:56.570 --> 03:00.850]  And as Louis said, Ernst Sievert,
[03:00.850 --> 03:03.530]  a faculty member at Alabama A&M University.
[03:03.530 --> 03:06.930]  And the very first slide is simply to show
[03:06.930 --> 03:10.170]  exactly where we do our work at a research station
[03:12.210 --> 03:13.370]  in Huntsville, Alabama.
[03:13.370 --> 03:15.650]  This is actually in Hazel Green, Alabama.
[03:15.650 --> 03:20.170]  So the first point I'd like to make
[03:20.170 --> 03:21.490]  in making this presentation
[03:21.490 --> 03:25.290]  is to show that Alabama is very unique
[03:25.290 --> 03:30.290]  in a sense that we have three land-grant
[03:31.890 --> 03:33.210]  independent university.
[03:33.210 --> 03:36.290]  No, they're simply connected
[03:36.290 --> 03:38.170]  because they're a land-grant institution,
[03:38.170 --> 03:41.530]  but they are independent institutions.
[03:41.530 --> 03:44.450]  And because of that, we have to be very careful
[03:44.450 --> 03:46.370]  how the kind of research that we do,
[03:46.370 --> 03:51.290]  any kind of federal funding that's provided
[03:51.290 --> 03:53.890]  to these state and federal funding
[03:53.890 --> 03:57.890]  is given with the concept in mind
[03:57.890 --> 04:00.610]  of not duplicating projects.
[04:00.610 --> 04:03.930]  So it makes it somewhat very unique
[04:03.930 --> 04:08.930]  for us to work together as three independent institutions.
[04:10.090 --> 04:13.250]  So as far as Alabama A&M is concerned,
[04:15.330 --> 04:17.410]  I had another slide there that missed.
[04:17.410 --> 04:19.570]  There was our research station slide that shows
[04:19.570 --> 04:21.810]  where we have all the work that we do here.
[04:21.810 --> 04:25.370]  We do it in about a thousand acre research station.
[04:25.370 --> 04:28.090]  That's about 10 miles north of the university
[04:28.090 --> 04:30.050]  where we do all of our work.
[04:30.050 --> 04:33.330]  The research station is subdivided into crops,
[04:34.210 --> 04:39.210]  horticulture type of work, animal work, and forestry work.
[04:40.090 --> 04:45.090]  So the topic of today, since we were supposed to mention,
[04:47.290 --> 04:50.610]  not mention, actually to focus on certain aspects
[04:50.610 --> 04:55.610]  of the botanical makeup of the cannabis genus
[04:59.210 --> 05:03.770]  and the various species that are associated with it.
[05:05.210 --> 05:07.650]  I know everyone who's probably listening to this talk
[05:07.650 --> 05:11.050]  know the history of cannabis here in the US
[05:11.050 --> 05:12.530]  and possibly around the world.
[05:12.530 --> 05:17.530]  One of the most ancient crop as far as cultivation
[05:18.530 --> 05:21.850]  for use of food, for use of medicine,
[05:21.850 --> 05:26.450]  and for use of materials and so on.
[05:26.450 --> 05:31.450]  So currently as we explored, we introduced the scrap
[05:32.210 --> 05:37.210]  in our myth for research and for consumer product and so on.
[05:37.650 --> 05:39.210]  There are renewed interest.
[05:40.170 --> 05:43.050]  A great deal of attention is being paid
[05:43.050 --> 05:45.930]  to the botanical aspect of these plants.
[05:46.210 --> 05:49.610]  The sativa, the indica, and rhodorelis,
[05:49.610 --> 05:54.610]  and then the hybrids of these three actually make up
[05:55.890 --> 06:00.890]  the rhodorelis, well, make up a different brand
[06:03.170 --> 06:08.170]  of the genus that we now being privy to.
[06:08.970 --> 06:12.770]  And as we collect more and more samples
[06:12.770 --> 06:15.410]  from around the world, as we collect samples
[06:15.810 --> 06:20.290]  to do our work, our concentration is mostly in THC,
[06:20.290 --> 06:23.650]  the psychoactive compound,
[06:23.650 --> 06:27.970]  and also the non-psychoactive compound, cannabinoid,
[06:27.970 --> 06:30.210]  which with medicinal properties
[06:30.210 --> 06:34.050]  and all of the type of potential characteristic
[06:34.050 --> 06:37.650]  of the plant, properties of the plant that we can use,
[06:37.650 --> 06:40.650]  that we have to explore to see how they can be put
[06:40.650 --> 06:43.210]  into a consumer product and use.
[06:43.250 --> 06:46.410]  Now, of course, in dealing with the plants,
[06:46.410 --> 06:49.650]  we have to understand the various form
[06:49.650 --> 06:53.250]  that we're gonna come in contact with,
[06:54.090 --> 06:57.570]  the monaceous type, the diaceous type,
[06:57.570 --> 07:00.610]  and hermaphroditic types.
[07:00.610 --> 07:05.610]  So we are in the early days of understanding the plant again
[07:09.130 --> 07:10.490]  in the research sphere,
[07:10.490 --> 07:13.530]  so we have to be dealing with all these type
[07:13.530 --> 07:17.370]  of botanical specification on a regular process.
[07:17.370 --> 07:19.850]  So let me do something here.
[07:21.250 --> 07:25.250]  So again, to continue showing
[07:25.250 --> 07:29.170]  that these are probably your primary interests
[07:29.170 --> 07:34.170]  that the public is interested in when it comes to cannabis,
[07:35.170 --> 07:40.170]  as it began to open up,
[07:40.170 --> 07:44.170]  the legality of it has begun to open up across the country.
[07:44.170 --> 07:49.170]  It's still in the hand of the federal government
[07:50.890 --> 07:52.730]  to actually open it up completely.
[07:52.730 --> 07:55.930]  So therefore, in our research world,
[07:55.930 --> 07:57.530]  we don't really have to worry
[07:57.530 --> 08:02.530]  about whether we're above a certain range of THC or not,
[08:03.050 --> 08:07.090]  but nonetheless, with the new rules that existing today
[08:07.090 --> 08:10.610]  of a specific level of THC,
[08:10.610 --> 08:13.450]  so as long as we remain at that level,
[08:13.450 --> 08:17.930]  we know that to be able to focus on these type of cannabinoid
[08:17.930 --> 08:20.810]  that a great deal of progress is being made right now
[08:20.810 --> 08:22.130]  across the country.
[08:22.130 --> 08:26.490]  So in the process, we here at A&M,
[08:26.490 --> 08:27.930]  we do a great deal of work
[08:27.930 --> 08:30.930]  with other colleagues across the country,
[08:30.970 --> 08:34.010]  and this is actually a slide from one of our partner
[08:34.010 --> 08:39.010]  from Oregon State University, Dr. Jeffrey Steiner,
[08:39.130 --> 08:42.690]  where he was emphasizing the future
[08:42.690 --> 08:46.850]  of these type of cannabinoid as to over time
[08:46.850 --> 08:51.850]  that we will see a greater marketing strategy
[08:54.450 --> 08:56.930]  that can be developed mainly
[08:56.970 --> 09:01.090]  because of the increased production,
[09:01.090 --> 09:02.290]  the increased interest,
[09:02.290 --> 09:05.090]  the increased demand for these products.
[09:05.090 --> 09:08.010]  So right now, we know that the very first few years
[09:08.010 --> 09:12.530]  of growing essential oil or hemp for CBD,
[09:13.530 --> 09:15.690]  the market is already down here.
[09:15.690 --> 09:17.690]  Okay, the market is already down here
[09:17.690 --> 09:20.170]  because of an overabundance of crop
[09:20.170 --> 09:25.170]  that was produced within the last few years,
[09:25.970 --> 09:29.850]  since 2014 from the 2014 Farm Bill.
[09:29.850 --> 09:33.930]  So, but of course, the point that was being made here
[09:33.930 --> 09:36.530]  by Dr. Steiner is that the science
[09:36.530 --> 09:38.930]  must come before the market.
[09:38.930 --> 09:41.810]  So this is where then we are focusing
[09:41.810 --> 09:44.490]  on trying to understand the science of the crop.
[09:44.490 --> 09:49.490]  So here is a slide showing some of an RCBD design
[09:49.530 --> 09:54.530]  of six cultivars of hemp that we received from Oregon State.
[10:00.370 --> 10:04.690]  And it's, let me see if I can remove my,
[10:06.250 --> 10:08.730]  something's hiding my slides here.
[10:08.730 --> 10:11.930]  Yeah, it shows that at Oregon State University,
[10:11.930 --> 10:15.330]  they're up there at near 45 degrees North latitude.
[10:15.330 --> 10:17.290]  And then we're down here at 34
[10:17.330 --> 10:19.730]  and where we are in Huntsville.
[10:19.730 --> 10:24.130]  So their goal at the Global Hemp Innovation Center
[10:24.130 --> 10:28.210]  was to go across to a 45 degree latitude around the world
[10:28.210 --> 10:29.850]  and collect samples that they know
[10:29.850 --> 10:34.850]  that would sort of adapt to their region.
[10:35.250 --> 10:37.970]  So once they get some of these entries,
[10:37.970 --> 10:41.890]  some of them they sent to us down here in Huntsville
[10:41.890 --> 10:43.530]  at this different latitude,
[10:43.530 --> 10:46.850]  and to begin to look into the potential adaptation
[10:47.370 --> 10:48.650]  of this thing in our area.
[10:48.650 --> 10:50.210]  So what are we doing with these things?
[10:50.210 --> 10:52.010]  Well, when we receive them,
[10:54.690 --> 10:56.930]  okay, once we receive them,
[10:58.930 --> 11:00.330]  throughout the growing season,
[11:00.330 --> 11:04.130]  we collect a series of data, which we'll show in a minute.
[11:04.130 --> 11:08.890]  And then eventually, once we harvest these plants,
[11:08.890 --> 11:13.650]  we go through a series of post-harvest analysis
[11:13.650 --> 11:15.170]  and data collection.
[11:15.170 --> 11:18.850]  And then once we collect all this information,
[11:18.850 --> 11:23.850]  we then send the floral material to Oregon
[11:24.170 --> 11:26.410]  and they do all the cannabinoid analysis
[11:26.410 --> 11:29.090]  while we do all the phenotypic characterization
[11:29.090 --> 11:30.370]  here in our area.
[11:31.450 --> 11:35.050]  They will do their G by E type of analysis
[11:35.050 --> 11:38.450]  with cannabinoid and phenotypic data.
[11:38.450 --> 11:41.050]  So this is the process that we followed.
[11:41.050 --> 11:45.210]  And this is an example of what we do
[11:45.210 --> 11:47.970]  during the ultra-vital season.
[11:47.970 --> 11:50.890]  We're looking at some full season entries
[11:52.330 --> 11:55.170]  versus some auto-CBD type.
[11:55.170 --> 11:59.650]  And we do the plant height, the same diameters,
[11:59.650 --> 12:02.170]  the inflorescence weight, dry weight,
[12:02.170 --> 12:04.010]  and all these types of data.
[12:04.010 --> 12:07.650]  We do, this is data actually from 2020,
[12:07.650 --> 12:11.450]  but we've been growing it 2021, 2022.
[12:11.450 --> 12:15.210]  So on a regular basis, this type of characteristic
[12:15.210 --> 12:18.450]  is showing us which among the cultivars
[12:18.450 --> 12:23.250]  that are sent to us here in Huntsville
[12:23.250 --> 12:27.490]  that actually can be recommended for growers
[12:27.490 --> 12:31.090]  in our region for their production,
[12:31.090 --> 12:33.890]  mainly based on those phenotypic characteristic
[12:33.890 --> 12:36.410]  and the final yield of these characteristics.
[12:36.410 --> 12:40.890]  But final data with the essential oil
[12:40.890 --> 12:45.330]  will be shared with us from Oregon State, from their labs.
[12:45.330 --> 12:49.290]  So now to show all the other,
[12:50.690 --> 12:55.690]  we take advantage of having these cultivars here
[12:56.810 --> 12:58.570]  to do other type of work.
[12:58.570 --> 13:01.770]  For instance, this slide is simply showing
[13:01.810 --> 13:06.490]  to one of our professors, Dr. Sandor and his student,
[13:06.490 --> 13:10.690]  where that field, the picture I just showed you earlier,
[13:10.690 --> 13:14.490]  where they actually came when we first planted it.
[13:14.490 --> 13:18.330]  As we're about to plant it and the RCB set up,
[13:18.330 --> 13:20.650]  they came and collect soil samples,
[13:20.650 --> 13:22.570]  randomly select some location
[13:22.570 --> 13:27.570]  where the plants are planted and collect soil samples
[13:27.570 --> 13:29.970]  and did analysis for metal.
[13:29.970 --> 13:33.290]  And then they waited until the end of the season,
[13:33.290 --> 13:38.210]  came again, the same location, harvested the plants,
[13:38.210 --> 13:40.530]  and then takes more soil sample
[13:40.530 --> 13:43.410]  and then to run the soil sample to actually see,
[13:44.450 --> 13:47.450]  are there certain type of metal accumulation
[13:47.450 --> 13:49.130]  and components of the plants?
[13:49.130 --> 13:50.170]  And the reason we're doing this
[13:50.170 --> 13:53.050]  is because here in Alabama, we have this,
[13:53.050 --> 13:54.450]  at least in Northern Alabama,
[13:54.450 --> 13:59.250]  we have a red clay soil that tends to sometimes
[14:00.770 --> 14:03.610]  on the acidic side and then the acidic side
[14:03.610 --> 14:05.330]  would actually would make some of these metals
[14:05.330 --> 14:09.050]  become bioavailable for uptake.
[14:09.050 --> 14:11.810]  And well, then what is,
[14:11.810 --> 14:15.850]  where do they go when the uptake occur?
[14:15.850 --> 14:19.490]  So, and these slides are in two cultivars
[14:19.490 --> 14:24.010]  that we have here, Queen Dream and a photo CBD entry
[14:24.010 --> 14:28.690]  that these metals are accumulating in the roots
[14:28.690 --> 14:30.730]  and the stems and in the leaves,
[14:31.650 --> 14:34.770]  the R, S and L here represent that.
[14:34.770 --> 14:38.290]  So the pH where we did this work
[14:38.290 --> 14:43.290]  was definitely on the acidic side, about 5.4 pH.
[14:43.970 --> 14:48.610]  So therefore that's enough to see that these metals
[14:48.610 --> 14:52.770]  are being sequestered by the plant
[14:52.770 --> 14:57.250]  without showing any detrimental side impact
[14:58.090 --> 15:02.450]  during the process of the life cycle of the plant.
[15:02.450 --> 15:05.250]  So this process is ongoing.
[15:05.250 --> 15:07.010]  So we have more information about this
[15:07.010 --> 15:09.010]  that will be released later on.
[15:09.010 --> 15:12.290]  Further on, since we partnered with a team
[15:12.290 --> 15:15.890]  in Geneva, New York, Dr. Stansel and his team
[15:15.890 --> 15:20.890]  with PGRU group, we are following the very specific protocol
[15:21.730 --> 15:26.730]  from the descriptor handbook to on samples
[15:29.290 --> 15:33.130]  that are sent to us from the diverse germ plasm
[15:33.130 --> 15:35.090]  up there in Geneva.
[15:35.090 --> 15:39.050]  So we have two sets of approach for this,
[15:39.050 --> 15:42.410]  where we focusing based on the archetype of the plant,
[15:42.410 --> 15:44.210]  where there was a single stem
[15:44.210 --> 15:48.210]  that's not with very minimal branching.
[15:48.210 --> 15:49.850]  We focus on the stem.
[15:49.850 --> 15:53.930]  And then if however the plant has a different archetype,
[15:53.930 --> 15:58.290]  we actually focus on a complete height like characteristic
[15:58.290 --> 16:03.290]  measuring various growth patterns of the plant
[16:03.570 --> 16:06.650]  by looking at branching, height,
[16:07.530 --> 16:10.490]  maximum canopy diameter and so on,
[16:10.490 --> 16:12.650]  the height at mid point of the plant
[16:12.650 --> 16:16.250]  and then also trunk length, stem diameter
[16:16.250 --> 16:18.690]  and to see how all of these contribute
[16:18.690 --> 16:22.410]  to the final product that we're looking for in the hemp.
[16:22.410 --> 16:27.410]  So, so far we are seeing those phenotypic characteristic
[16:32.210 --> 16:36.650]  and how they correlate with the one aspect of the plant
[16:36.650 --> 16:38.970]  that we probably most interested in
[16:38.970 --> 16:41.970]  is the dry mass production.
[16:41.970 --> 16:44.930]  And then with the dry mass production in terms of height
[16:44.930 --> 16:48.610]  and term of a number of branches and stem diameter
[16:48.610 --> 16:53.530]  and a key one that shows the difference there
[16:53.530 --> 16:58.530]  is the distance of the first branch,
[16:59.970 --> 17:04.490]  which of course is related to,
[17:04.490 --> 17:09.490]  which can be directly related to the population of the plots.
[17:10.490 --> 17:15.490]  So the more the population, the more dense a plot is,
[17:17.490 --> 17:22.490]  therefore the higher up the first branch are,
[17:22.890 --> 17:24.770]  but then the first branches are also,
[17:24.770 --> 17:27.210]  but of course we see plants that even though
[17:27.210 --> 17:31.530]  they're not in a very crowded position,
[17:31.530 --> 17:35.730]  sometimes the first branch tend to be much higher up.
[17:35.730 --> 17:37.050]  So of course for fiber,
[17:37.130 --> 17:41.450]  we would see the very minimal branches
[17:42.890 --> 17:46.570]  being produced by the plant,
[17:46.570 --> 17:51.570]  while for the CBD oil type of the essential oil
[17:51.730 --> 17:54.610]  when it's grown for cannabinoid, the female plants only,
[17:54.610 --> 17:57.930]  of course the branchings now started as low as possible
[17:57.930 --> 18:00.370]  in the plant from our experience here.
[18:00.370 --> 18:04.650]  So this was just an example of two different entries
[18:04.650 --> 18:08.490]  that we received from New York, from Geneva,
[18:08.490 --> 18:09.930]  entry one, entry two,
[18:09.930 --> 18:14.930]  and we're seeing the very same pattern being exerted
[18:16.330 --> 18:19.210]  based on those measurement from the hemp descriptor
[18:19.210 --> 18:20.770]  that we're receiving.
[18:20.770 --> 18:24.930]  Now, this first set of slide that I showed you here
[18:24.930 --> 18:27.210]  is probably what we're doing the most
[18:27.210 --> 18:30.690]  when it comes to high cannabinoid hemp
[18:30.690 --> 18:33.770]  here at Alabama A&M University.
[18:33.770 --> 18:35.250]  And then of course, as you can see,
[18:35.250 --> 18:38.810]  it is with a collaboration with other partners
[18:38.810 --> 18:42.610]  across the country, with Oregon State,
[18:42.610 --> 18:47.410]  with Geneva, New York, with the SN84 group
[18:47.410 --> 18:49.730]  and University of Kentucky.
[18:49.730 --> 18:52.770]  But this next set of slide that I'm gonna show you
[18:52.770 --> 18:57.770]  is basically of what we have been doing here in our end
[18:58.050 --> 19:01.570]  more independently than, again,
[19:01.570 --> 19:03.010]  with a collaboration with others,
[19:03.010 --> 19:05.850]  but still that we are initiating
[19:06.730 --> 19:08.850]  here at Alabama A&M University.
[19:08.850 --> 19:11.290]  So we have a great deal of internal colleague
[19:11.290 --> 19:14.890]  at the university from the biology,
[19:14.890 --> 19:18.290]  food and animal science, college of engineering,
[19:18.290 --> 19:23.130]  and then also with other institution that I mentioned
[19:23.130 --> 19:25.130]  that we're also partnering.
[19:25.130 --> 19:30.130]  So what, remember 2019 was when Alabama
[19:31.810 --> 19:34.930]  as a state first allowed the production of hemp,
[19:34.930 --> 19:39.930]  whether it's by universities or public growers,
[19:42.210 --> 19:44.050]  extractors, it didn't matter.
[19:44.050 --> 19:46.970]  We're just right after the 2018 Farm Bill,
[19:46.970 --> 19:49.250]  the state simply jumped to the process
[19:49.250 --> 19:51.050]  and it was sort of very chaotic.
[19:52.010 --> 19:53.250]  Were we ready?
[19:53.250 --> 19:54.730]  Well, no, we weren't ready.
[19:54.730 --> 19:57.370]  We didn't know truly how to approach it,
[19:57.370 --> 19:59.850]  but so we were the first one here in the state
[19:59.850 --> 20:04.850]  to begin the process of putting some experimental plots
[20:05.170 --> 20:06.210]  on the ground.
[20:06.210 --> 20:08.610]  So we tried planting with a drill,
[20:10.330 --> 20:12.450]  then we try broadcasting.
[20:12.450 --> 20:13.930]  We, in the broadcasting,
[20:13.930 --> 20:15.770]  we realized we had to do some rolling
[20:15.770 --> 20:20.770]  to create some action of the seed into the soil
[20:21.370 --> 20:24.890]  and waited with our fingers crossed
[20:24.890 --> 20:26.250]  with our high learning curve
[20:26.250 --> 20:27.930]  to see what's gonna happen next.
[20:27.970 --> 20:32.410]  So this is sort of an example of what happened next.
[20:33.810 --> 20:37.570]  The seeds that we broadcast, we learned very quickly,
[20:37.570 --> 20:42.410]  that's a no-no because every single one of those seeds
[20:42.410 --> 20:43.770]  became bird food.
[20:46.010 --> 20:50.050]  Our research station is actually a refuge for birds
[20:50.050 --> 20:53.170]  where birders come to take pictures
[20:53.170 --> 20:55.330]  and look at various type of birds
[20:55.330 --> 20:57.610]  and we're not supposed to hurt the birds,
[20:58.290 --> 21:01.250]  but the birds definitely ate all of our seeds,
[21:01.250 --> 21:02.490]  doves and others,
[21:02.490 --> 21:04.930]  basically all the birds seem to love hemp seeds.
[21:04.930 --> 21:06.250]  So we lost that.
[21:06.250 --> 21:07.610]  So we did some planting
[21:07.610 --> 21:10.130]  using a small Heggie experimental plot planter.
[21:10.130 --> 21:12.130]  This is not a very good picture of it,
[21:12.130 --> 21:16.050]  but this is an attempt of,
[21:17.010 --> 21:19.370]  you'll see better pictures of this,
[21:19.370 --> 21:21.090]  of planting with a small Heggie.
[21:21.090 --> 21:24.970]  And then this is the area where we planted with the drill.
[21:24.970 --> 21:26.370]  And very quickly,
[21:26.370 --> 21:30.930]  this is just maybe five to six days after planting,
[21:30.930 --> 21:32.090]  seven days after planting,
[21:32.090 --> 21:37.090]  we began to see very good quality seedlings emerging.
[21:38.730 --> 21:42.770]  But at the same time, we saw this, this is morning glory.
[21:42.770 --> 21:45.170]  This is the nemesis of hemp.
[21:45.170 --> 21:48.410]  And then we, shortly in this presentation,
[21:48.410 --> 21:50.290]  you'll see what I mean by that.
[21:50.290 --> 21:55.290]  So having these plots, that 2019,
[21:55.410 --> 21:58.490]  we were able to obtain eight cultivars.
[21:58.490 --> 22:03.490]  And it was just a mad dash for people trying to get seeds.
[22:06.010 --> 22:09.050]  You didn't know where you were getting your seeds from,
[22:09.050 --> 22:11.090]  whether those people were legitimate,
[22:11.970 --> 22:14.810]  the information that they're giving you and so on.
[22:14.810 --> 22:15.850]  The seeds, of course,
[22:15.850 --> 22:17.650]  the information were vetted by the state
[22:17.650 --> 22:19.090]  because the state had to approve
[22:19.090 --> 22:21.490]  every single cultivar that we planted.
[22:21.490 --> 22:25.610]  So we had a pseudo planting date experiment,
[22:25.610 --> 22:27.210]  not because we planned it,
[22:27.210 --> 22:29.410]  it's because that's when we received the seeds.
[22:29.410 --> 22:33.010]  We received seeds of Genma on June the 4th,
[22:33.010 --> 22:35.010]  and June the 5th, we're on the field planting it.
[22:35.010 --> 22:38.410]  We received these seeds on June the 18th,
[22:38.410 --> 22:41.170]  more seeds on June the 18th, four different cultivars.
[22:41.170 --> 22:44.410]  So we added the Genma with the other four,
[22:44.410 --> 22:46.930]  new four cultivars that we received,
[22:46.930 --> 22:49.170]  and then continue to do this
[22:49.170 --> 22:50.930]  each time we receive other cultivars.
[22:51.330 --> 22:52.170]  So as you can see,
[22:52.170 --> 22:54.730]  our planting date from June 5th to July 11th,
[22:54.730 --> 22:59.730]  just a month apart, definitely told us a lot.
[23:00.330 --> 23:03.970]  It told us that that's too late to plant the crop.
[23:05.090 --> 23:10.090]  Genma did very well, as opposed to many of the others,
[23:10.610 --> 23:12.810]  which did not fare well at all,
[23:12.810 --> 23:16.370]  there's the poor germination of noxious type of seeds
[23:16.370 --> 23:21.370]  that did not, that responded to more
[23:21.410 --> 23:24.410]  to photo period very quickly.
[23:24.410 --> 23:27.170]  So therefore we learned very quickly in the first year
[23:28.490 --> 23:29.730]  in our learning curve,
[23:29.730 --> 23:34.370]  that some of the do's and don'ts that we have to avoid.
[23:34.370 --> 23:36.170]  So again, but nonetheless,
[23:36.170 --> 23:39.330]  we took advantage of this and continue to make observation
[23:39.330 --> 23:42.450]  on tenuous basis of crop season.
[23:42.450 --> 23:44.730]  By the time we get to day 86,
[23:44.770 --> 23:49.770]  we saw that by the time we get to day 86,
[23:49.770 --> 23:53.610]  these plants were already at more than 50% male flowering,
[23:53.610 --> 23:56.090]  which is recommended if you're cutting,
[23:56.090 --> 23:58.370]  if you are planting for fiber,
[23:58.370 --> 23:59.530]  that's a good time to do it.
[23:59.530 --> 24:01.610]  So we did harvest,
[24:01.610 --> 24:05.890]  significant harvest of those Genma line that we have,
[24:05.890 --> 24:09.850]  and then allow them to sit on the field for rating,
[24:09.850 --> 24:12.450]  and then went on further to pay,
[24:12.450 --> 24:14.470]  to collect more information.
[24:15.470 --> 24:17.530]  The learning curve, at the same time,
[24:17.530 --> 24:19.810]  this is an example of one of our planting date,
[24:19.810 --> 24:22.410]  earlier planting date, a second planting date,
[24:22.410 --> 24:24.130]  so another planting date here,
[24:24.130 --> 24:25.850]  at the day that we were planting it,
[24:25.850 --> 24:28.370]  we were in our little heggy planter,
[24:28.370 --> 24:30.770]  a six row experimental plot planter,
[24:30.770 --> 24:33.490]  and a downpour thunderstorm camp
[24:33.490 --> 24:35.730]  that produced so much rain
[24:35.730 --> 24:39.690]  that we had standing water there for a day or more.
[24:39.690 --> 24:42.130]  And we can see that there's certain area
[24:42.130 --> 24:44.930]  that never really recovered fully,
[24:44.930 --> 24:49.930]  recovered from being underwater
[24:49.930 --> 24:51.770]  with the root being saturated,
[24:51.770 --> 24:54.030]  which then automatically tells us that,
[24:55.650 --> 24:59.610]  your plot selection has to be a well-drained area
[24:59.610 --> 25:01.850]  where you know the root of your plant
[25:01.850 --> 25:04.770]  is not gonna be saturated with water
[25:04.770 --> 25:07.370]  because it will not perform very well.
[25:07.370 --> 25:10.050]  So this is again, another view of that year
[25:10.050 --> 25:14.010]  where our Genma did very well
[25:14.010 --> 25:15.810]  considering that was planted late.
[25:16.730 --> 25:20.130]  And then on the bottom left picture
[25:20.130 --> 25:25.130]  is the RCBD design of those eight cultivars
[25:25.370 --> 25:26.290]  at different date,
[25:26.290 --> 25:29.250]  still all the better looking plots you see here
[25:29.250 --> 25:32.730]  still represent a Genma cultivar
[25:32.730 --> 25:34.970]  where the others did not as well.
[25:34.970 --> 25:37.770]  We also observe all other necessary information
[25:37.770 --> 25:39.050]  that we needed to.
[25:39.050 --> 25:40.570]  Anything we see, we recorded,
[25:40.570 --> 25:42.850]  whether it was qualitative or quantitative,
[25:42.850 --> 25:46.830]  we began to get an idea and a picture
[25:46.830 --> 25:48.410]  of what we're dealing with
[25:48.410 --> 25:51.770]  when it comes to this particular crop.
[25:51.770 --> 25:54.450]  We can see a nice beneficial insect here,
[25:54.450 --> 25:57.850]  but not a very so beneficial one in the upper right hand
[25:57.850 --> 26:02.450]  where you see a sucking insect that can cause it.
[26:02.450 --> 26:07.450]  But again, since this is the male flower,
[26:07.930 --> 26:10.850]  we weren't really concerned about the presence
[26:10.850 --> 26:14.250]  of certain harmful insect
[26:14.250 --> 26:16.410]  because they're not really damaging a part
[26:16.410 --> 26:20.290]  that's gonna be very useful as we go on in the plant,
[26:20.290 --> 26:22.370]  as long as these plants produce their pollen.
[26:22.370 --> 26:24.370]  If you're growing for seeds,
[26:24.370 --> 26:28.850]  then we don't think that these kind of nemesis
[26:28.850 --> 26:31.090]  would cause issue.
[26:31.090 --> 26:34.770]  Our primary concern, however, the good guys,
[26:34.770 --> 26:39.770]  those bees, we have probably 50 or more beehives
[26:41.010 --> 26:42.490]  at our research station.
[26:42.490 --> 26:47.490]  And those bees do forage the male cannabis plant
[26:48.930 --> 26:50.890]  significantly, as you can see,
[26:50.890 --> 26:53.930]  with taking pollens back to their hives.
[26:53.930 --> 26:58.930]  And we actually, the apiary folks that we work with,
[26:59.290 --> 27:04.290]  they actually put some drawers where an entry point
[27:05.130 --> 27:07.970]  where the bees return to the hive
[27:07.970 --> 27:11.210]  where that pollen can actually be squeezed off
[27:11.210 --> 27:16.210]  and fall into a drawer that can be now collected
[27:18.130 --> 27:20.290]  to see the constituent of this pollen.
[27:20.290 --> 27:23.330]  So this is the type of work that we try to do.
[27:23.330 --> 27:27.050]  And we saw the opportunity and go for that.
[27:27.050 --> 27:30.170]  Now, what's the number one nemesis I was telling you about?
[27:30.170 --> 27:31.010]  Well, weed.
[27:31.010 --> 27:33.970]  Weed is definitely the issue, as you can see from,
[27:34.650 --> 27:37.210]  we followed the process of the first year when we planted,
[27:37.210 --> 27:40.290]  when there were no chemical that was allowed
[27:40.290 --> 27:42.490]  to even use on the hemp.
[27:42.490 --> 27:47.210]  And we quickly realized the problem that you have
[27:47.210 --> 27:51.650]  and planting very late, June, July,
[27:51.650 --> 27:55.930]  where the local weed species are already in full fledge,
[27:55.930 --> 28:00.530]  ready to germinate and reproduce.
[28:00.530 --> 28:03.650]  So therefore, the hemp did not have an opportunity
[28:04.330 --> 28:07.490]  to create a canopy, a full canopy to actually overshadow
[28:07.490 --> 28:09.490]  or even compete with those weeds.
[28:09.490 --> 28:14.010]  So that was a major learning experience.
[28:14.010 --> 28:17.610]  And then the other one was even the statement I just made
[28:17.610 --> 28:20.370]  about having a good canopy to overshadow
[28:21.810 --> 28:26.090]  undergrowth of the canopy, that didn't happen here.
[28:26.090 --> 28:31.090]  This is a picture of the same field, July 31st, August 24th.
[28:32.010 --> 28:34.130]  We're talking less than 30 days.
[28:34.130 --> 28:36.410]  And then this is what became of this field.
[28:36.410 --> 28:38.610]  It was a beautiful flowering field
[28:38.610 --> 28:40.410]  instead of a beautiful hemp field.
[28:40.410 --> 28:43.730]  And at this stage, the bottom picture is a complete loss
[28:43.730 --> 28:48.170]  because you can't even, even if seeds were produced here,
[28:48.170 --> 28:52.290]  you can even take a combine there to harvest the seeds.
[28:52.290 --> 28:57.290]  This is a slide that we really like to show to growers
[28:58.290 --> 29:02.490]  who said, expect this to happen
[29:02.490 --> 29:06.050]  if you don't have a weed control management system.
[29:06.050 --> 29:09.450]  So we also have an issue that happened,
[29:09.450 --> 29:12.770]  I believe in 2020 or 2021,
[29:12.770 --> 29:17.770]  that 2020 when we had an infestation of army earworm,
[29:18.650 --> 29:21.690]  and but in their case, they were focusing
[29:21.690 --> 29:24.770]  on consuming the essential oil hemp.
[29:24.770 --> 29:27.330]  This is some of the entries from an entry
[29:27.330 --> 29:31.650]  from a cannabinoid plot, entries from Oregon.
[29:31.650 --> 29:34.810]  And these, as you can see, this is the video
[29:34.810 --> 29:37.330]  doesn't show you the whole aspect.
[29:37.330 --> 29:38.730]  I was trying to get a closeup
[29:38.730 --> 29:41.890]  and you can see all the other areas of the particular leaf
[29:41.890 --> 29:43.850]  that's already been consumed
[29:43.850 --> 29:45.170]  by this little critter right here.
[29:45.170 --> 29:50.170]  So we definitely think that this is, I mean,
[29:50.810 --> 29:53.010]  there are people right now already working on that
[29:53.010 --> 29:56.570]  down at Auburn, our friend at Auburn,
[29:56.570 --> 29:59.650]  they are already looking into protocol
[29:59.650 --> 30:04.090]  to overcome this type of situation that can be devastating.
[30:04.090 --> 30:06.050]  So I'll go back.
[30:06.050 --> 30:09.530]  So again, these are the data from that very first year
[30:09.530 --> 30:10.650]  that we collected.
[30:10.650 --> 30:14.090]  Again, we talk about Genma, July 5th, July 19,
[30:14.090 --> 30:17.370]  and June 19 and July 11, 19.
[30:17.370 --> 30:20.410]  And to see the productivity in biomass
[30:21.170 --> 30:24.650]  and then the growth, the height
[30:24.650 --> 30:26.290]  or the growth pattern of these things.
[30:26.290 --> 30:29.810]  And we think that all these also have to do
[30:29.810 --> 30:33.610]  the planting date, which also relates to photo period.
[30:33.610 --> 30:38.130]  So as the days get shorter during these,
[30:38.130 --> 30:41.650]  the production, the latter stages of production
[30:41.650 --> 30:44.570]  of these, of biomass production of these plants,
[30:44.570 --> 30:49.010]  we see that they also quickly revert,
[30:49.050 --> 30:51.090]  transition into reproduction
[30:51.090 --> 30:54.130]  and then not much biomass production at those later days.
[30:54.130 --> 30:56.450]  We think our idea of planting date
[30:56.450 --> 30:58.170]  should be very early in the spring,
[30:58.170 --> 31:01.770]  probably as early as late April,
[31:01.770 --> 31:04.890]  I mean, mid April, even late March,
[31:04.890 --> 31:07.130]  that we can actually start the planting process here.
[31:07.130 --> 31:09.890]  Most likely mid April would be a good.
[31:09.890 --> 31:11.730]  So as you can see, all the other varieties
[31:11.730 --> 31:14.330]  that we planted that year did not do well at all.
[31:14.370 --> 31:15.970]  Those monocious type,
[31:17.050 --> 31:21.210]  they simply reacted to a photo period situation,
[31:21.210 --> 31:26.210]  immediately began a transition into flowering mode
[31:26.730 --> 31:29.530]  or reproductive mode with very little biomass
[31:29.530 --> 31:31.130]  being produced at all.
[31:31.130 --> 31:34.050]  Those, if you recall those earlier pictures
[31:34.050 --> 31:37.530]  next to the genma, those were those other cultivars.
[31:37.530 --> 31:40.850]  So we've since stayed away from these as much as we can
[31:40.850 --> 31:42.930]  because we know that they do not do,
[31:42.930 --> 31:45.570]  perform well here in our area.
[31:45.570 --> 31:49.250]  Now, I'm just gonna very quickly sort of show
[31:49.250 --> 31:54.250]  some of various work that we're trying to do
[31:55.690 --> 31:58.570]  because we have the hemp to see if we can take advantage
[31:58.570 --> 32:02.290]  of this to have a better understanding of the crop.
[32:02.290 --> 32:05.090]  We know the physiological process of germination.
[32:05.090 --> 32:07.370]  A lot of the seeds that we receive,
[32:09.170 --> 32:11.690]  some of them have very poor germination
[32:11.690 --> 32:16.570]  and therefore we took up an experiment
[32:16.570 --> 32:21.570]  of exposing our hemp seed to a low temperature plasma.
[32:22.050 --> 32:23.730]  Very good question, why do this?
[32:23.730 --> 32:28.570]  Well, we just happened to have a collaborative grant
[32:28.570 --> 32:32.170]  with the University of Huntsville, Alabama,
[32:32.170 --> 32:37.170]  an F-score grant to, at the bottom or lower right here,
[32:38.170 --> 32:41.250]  the acronym is CPU2AL,
[32:41.250 --> 32:45.530]  that stands for Connecting the Plasma Universe to Alabama.
[32:45.530 --> 32:49.170]  So in that case, we saw that low temperature plasma
[32:49.170 --> 32:52.750]  has multiple function and application.
[32:52.750 --> 32:57.250]  So in this project, we were supposed to try
[32:57.250 --> 33:01.690]  to see potential all other application for it.
[33:01.690 --> 33:05.290]  And one successful application was that it worked very well
[33:05.690 --> 33:10.290]  enhancing the germination of tumor rhizome.
[33:10.290 --> 33:12.690]  So we said, why not try hemp also?
[33:12.690 --> 33:16.450]  So we tried with a student
[33:16.450 --> 33:18.170]  to understand the concept of plasma,
[33:18.170 --> 33:20.210]  which is not our field in agriculture,
[33:20.210 --> 33:22.250]  but to come to a point to understand it.
[33:22.250 --> 33:25.810]  And then basically it's an ionization process
[33:25.810 --> 33:28.290]  of an inert gas that we do,
[33:29.290 --> 33:33.250]  how we do it, helium, argon,
[33:34.770 --> 33:38.050]  with a high voltage and in the ionization process,
[33:38.050 --> 33:42.010]  the ions that are the result of this process,
[33:42.010 --> 33:44.750]  we feel that are able to interact
[33:44.750 --> 33:47.250]  with other biological surfaces.
[33:47.250 --> 33:48.770]  And that's what the project is.
[33:48.770 --> 33:52.890]  We use three different types of plasma exposure,
[33:52.890 --> 33:57.050]  a sheet plasma, a jet plasma, and a chamber plasma.
[33:57.050 --> 33:59.850]  All these, at least the two, the sheet and the jet
[33:59.850 --> 34:04.570]  were stuff that's done at University of Alabama
[34:04.570 --> 34:06.410]  engineering department that build those things,
[34:06.410 --> 34:07.730]  while the chamber one we did
[34:08.770 --> 34:12.810]  in Birmingham University of Alabama in Birmingham,
[34:12.810 --> 34:15.330]  where they have a system.
[34:15.330 --> 34:20.330]  And what we wanted to see is that can the exposure
[34:20.530 --> 34:24.690]  of the seeds through the low temperature plasma,
[34:24.730 --> 34:26.650]  whether it's soaked, not soaked,
[34:27.570 --> 34:31.010]  would actually provide, show an impact
[34:31.010 --> 34:34.610]  in helping enhancing or speeding up
[34:34.610 --> 34:36.770]  the process of the germination.
[34:36.770 --> 34:40.530]  And also the length of time you allowed the plasma
[34:40.530 --> 34:42.690]  to be exposed to the seeds seemed to have
[34:42.690 --> 34:47.690]  a major difference because we saw that in turmeric
[34:47.770 --> 34:51.210]  that the time, like a 90 second exposure
[34:51.210 --> 34:55.730]  has better result than a 30 second exposure
[34:55.730 --> 34:58.650]  and even better result than 120 second exposure.
[34:58.650 --> 35:02.370]  So therefore we tried all these with seeds of the,
[35:02.370 --> 35:05.210]  where we try to keep track of the exact seeds
[35:05.210 --> 35:10.210]  by exposing single seeds to the process.
[35:10.610 --> 35:14.850]  And our results simply showed that any seed that we had
[35:14.850 --> 35:18.490]  that was soaked 24 hours before
[35:18.490 --> 35:20.450]  and then treated with the plasma
[35:20.490 --> 35:22.490]  came out as the fastest one
[35:22.490 --> 35:24.930]  to begin the germination process.
[35:24.930 --> 35:27.090]  Those that were soaked and not treated at all
[35:27.090 --> 35:32.090]  with the plasma still can follow the first one and so on.
[35:33.930 --> 35:36.330]  This would be the real control
[35:36.330 --> 35:38.490]  because this is the seed as we receive it
[35:38.490 --> 35:41.170]  from the package from the source.
[35:41.170 --> 35:44.050]  So these seeds, they did all right
[35:44.050 --> 35:45.970]  even when they're treated with the plasma
[35:45.970 --> 35:49.690]  and while the untreated version came out last
[35:50.690 --> 35:51.810]  as they can pass.
[35:51.810 --> 35:53.450]  So this is actually our final slide
[35:53.450 --> 35:56.930]  about this plasma response.
[35:56.930 --> 35:59.010]  I'm sorry, this is a very busy slide.
[35:59.010 --> 36:00.730]  We had students on this workforce
[36:00.730 --> 36:02.730]  where they were measuring a time measurement
[36:02.730 --> 36:06.530]  of the length of the radical.
[36:06.530 --> 36:10.330]  And then to see that this is variety one,
[36:10.330 --> 36:12.010]  variety two, variety three,
[36:12.010 --> 36:14.170]  there's a feminized seeds,
[36:14.170 --> 36:18.130]  seeds that were for CBD planting.
[36:18.130 --> 36:22.050]  So we see that there's a response by cultivar.
[36:22.050 --> 36:23.730]  So therefore that experiment definitely
[36:23.730 --> 36:25.730]  we have to go back and repeat it
[36:25.730 --> 36:29.250]  and really do more better control approach
[36:29.250 --> 36:33.650]  to see truly if exposing the plant to the seeds,
[36:33.650 --> 36:35.810]  to plasma can actually make a difference
[36:35.810 --> 36:39.970]  and enhancing and then speeding up the germination process.
[36:39.970 --> 36:44.090]  So, but again, moving on, we have,
[36:44.090 --> 36:46.610]  or I have to move on very quickly.
[36:46.610 --> 36:49.450]  We work with our food science department
[36:49.450 --> 36:51.250]  with Dr. Okafer and a student.
[36:51.250 --> 36:54.930]  We're looking at other nutritional values
[36:54.930 --> 36:56.970]  and characteristics of looking at flavonoid
[36:56.970 --> 37:01.970]  and phenolic compounds and various tissues of the hemp.
[37:03.930 --> 37:07.410]  And we were able to see very clear distinction
[37:07.410 --> 37:11.690]  even as showing by this grouping
[37:11.690 --> 37:14.850]  that shows that significantly
[37:14.890 --> 37:16.970]  that the leaves have a greater quantity
[37:16.970 --> 37:19.210]  of these kinds of compounds rather than the root
[37:19.210 --> 37:20.770]  that's right here at the bottom,
[37:20.770 --> 37:24.890]  very important compounds in the process of nutrition
[37:24.890 --> 37:26.810]  and antioxidant purposes.
[37:26.810 --> 37:29.210]  Another, that same group at the biology department
[37:29.210 --> 37:31.450]  also did some very good work
[37:31.450 --> 37:34.490]  in taking plant samples, hemp samples,
[37:34.490 --> 37:36.450]  and then taking pieces of these hemp samples,
[37:36.450 --> 37:40.770]  different tissues and placing them in different agar
[37:40.770 --> 37:43.330]  and then to observe what kind of growth that they're having
[37:43.330 --> 37:47.930]  that's actually transferred from the plant to those plants.
[37:47.930 --> 37:51.770]  And their findings, again, provide very good information
[37:51.770 --> 37:55.210]  as to what's out there in the field
[37:56.410 --> 38:00.610]  that we have to get a better understanding of.
[38:00.610 --> 38:02.330]  Now, one thing we're seeing here,
[38:02.330 --> 38:05.170]  we allow some of the plant to stay in the field
[38:05.170 --> 38:08.210]  and for the rating process,
[38:08.210 --> 38:09.450]  and some of them to allow them to go
[38:09.450 --> 38:11.210]  beyond the rating process
[38:11.210 --> 38:14.410]  and then to see the kind of organism
[38:14.410 --> 38:18.890]  that becomes more abundant in these tissue samples.
[38:18.890 --> 38:21.130]  And then we're looking at this,
[38:21.130 --> 38:23.290]  hopefully, maybe one day to be able to say,
[38:23.290 --> 38:27.650]  oh, we can create a cocktail of these organism
[38:27.650 --> 38:30.210]  that possibly could help the rating process,
[38:30.210 --> 38:32.130]  make the rating process a bit faster
[38:32.130 --> 38:34.330]  instead of letting the plant laying on the field
[38:34.330 --> 38:36.250]  for a long period of time.
[38:36.250 --> 38:38.250]  Furthermore, this is more information
[38:38.250 --> 38:40.250]  from that particular work
[38:40.250 --> 38:43.690]  showing the various components of the plant
[38:43.690 --> 38:49.690]  and the organism that were detected, isolated from them.
[38:49.690 --> 38:53.010]  And a lot of these were characterized
[38:53.010 --> 38:56.250]  and authenticated through DNA analysis.
[38:56.250 --> 38:58.090]  So in our food science department,
[38:58.090 --> 39:02.330]  another set of work that's being done by our PhD candidate,
[39:02.330 --> 39:06.810]  Dr. Aaron and his advisor, Dr. Osama,
[39:06.810 --> 39:09.930]  is that they're taking hemp samples,
[39:09.930 --> 39:11.090]  in-foresting samples,
[39:11.090 --> 39:14.930]  and actually doing some crude extract
[39:14.930 --> 39:17.450]  and taking the crude extract
[39:17.450 --> 39:23.210]  and creating some nanofiber by electrospanning with them,
[39:23.210 --> 39:26.170]  and then to be able to create
[39:26.170 --> 39:29.850]  sort of food packaging components with them
[39:29.850 --> 39:35.930]  and to be able to see if the profile of the cannabinoid
[39:35.930 --> 39:39.370]  can actually help in suppressing the activity
[39:39.370 --> 39:44.530]  of microorganism that normally would be prolific
[39:44.530 --> 39:47.730]  in some kind of, in this poultry or the food product.
[39:47.730 --> 39:53.050]  So this is an example of the electrospanning process
[39:53.050 --> 39:58.370]  that Aaron is doing in the food science lab.
[39:58.370 --> 40:00.330]  I think it's food engineering lab.
[40:00.330 --> 40:07.490]  And then this is an example of the product that is created,
[40:07.490 --> 40:11.490]  and that product now is what they would,
[40:11.490 --> 40:16.130]  has the encapsulated nanofiber particles
[40:16.130 --> 40:19.610]  with the active cannabinoid component.
[40:19.610 --> 40:24.090]  Again, this is a crude extract with all the profile.
[40:24.090 --> 40:26.930]  There's yet to be work to isolate
[40:26.970 --> 40:31.570]  this very specific cannabinoid to be able to say,
[40:31.570 --> 40:35.930]  this is, which one is actually more effective
[40:35.930 --> 40:38.130]  in decreasing the activity
[40:38.130 --> 40:44.290]  of these dangerous organism in our food system.
[40:44.290 --> 40:47.770]  But the results so far he's seeing that versus the control
[40:47.770 --> 40:52.770]  that they use polyvinyl alcohol as a control,
[40:52.770 --> 40:56.490]  we're seeing is saying that there's definitely a benefit.
[40:56.490 --> 40:59.050]  These two AA2, two A1, two A2,
[40:59.050 --> 41:00.330]  these are different concentration
[41:00.330 --> 41:02.090]  that he's not providing this concentration
[41:02.090 --> 41:04.650]  yet until he publishes paper.
[41:04.650 --> 41:13.570]  So this is showing that the micro-spinning embedded fibers
[41:13.570 --> 41:17.330]  into that packaging material
[41:17.330 --> 41:22.250]  is actually inhibiting, again, salmonella in the food system.
[41:22.250 --> 41:27.570]  So Mr. Aaron definitely is in the process right now
[41:27.570 --> 41:32.850]  of truly finalizing his dissertation,
[41:32.850 --> 41:39.250]  but I have many more issues to address in the process.
[41:39.250 --> 41:41.810]  We now, what else are we doing?
[41:41.810 --> 41:45.170]  Well, because we're focusing on hemp so much,
[41:45.170 --> 41:47.410]  even the first year, all the information
[41:47.410 --> 41:51.370]  that we received from Genma and other cultures,
[41:51.370 --> 41:54.690]  are we able to do some hand-reading,
[41:54.690 --> 41:59.050]  seed cleansing, seed analysis,
[41:59.050 --> 42:02.930]  some herd and some hempcrete material?
[42:02.930 --> 42:07.450]  Now, one story about this seed, after we cleaned the seed,
[42:07.450 --> 42:08.690]  put it through a seed cleaner
[42:08.690 --> 42:15.570]  and then separate the unnecessary biomass.
[42:15.570 --> 42:18.970]  The biomass that was to be just jettisoned,
[42:19.290 --> 42:24.170]  to be discarded, was actually used by one of our professors,
[42:24.170 --> 42:28.530]  Dr. Vizcarra, to feed poultry on a skip-a-day process.
[42:28.530 --> 42:31.610]  The skip-a-day process is when you don't feed the poultry
[42:31.610 --> 42:34.530]  for about a day, so they don't grow too fast
[42:34.530 --> 42:37.210]  during a breeding experiment,
[42:37.210 --> 42:39.610]  but they tend to peck each other nonstop.
[42:39.610 --> 42:42.410]  But just by providing them what we refer to
[42:42.410 --> 42:44.850]  as a non-nutritious component,
[42:44.850 --> 42:47.770]  they were able to stay busy and not pecking on each other.
[42:47.810 --> 42:50.570]  So we also look at...
[42:50.570 --> 42:52.890]  These, actually, on the right,
[42:52.890 --> 42:57.570]  actually came from essential oil hemp cultivars
[42:57.570 --> 43:00.410]  that we collected some stem from a producer
[43:00.410 --> 43:02.650]  and then ground these stems,
[43:02.650 --> 43:04.970]  because these stems are not very good for reading
[43:04.970 --> 43:07.690]  because they have a lot of nodes for branching,
[43:07.690 --> 43:09.650]  but we still see potential uses for them.
[43:09.650 --> 43:11.410]  So we ground them very well.
[43:11.410 --> 43:15.210]  We use a vibration system to separate the fiber,
[43:15.210 --> 43:19.690]  and then we're able to pick up a little set of fiber
[43:19.690 --> 43:22.210]  this way that clings together very well.
[43:22.210 --> 43:25.690]  And then we actually had some of these fibers analyzed
[43:25.690 --> 43:30.690]  to see SEM microscopy characteristic of them.
[43:33.170 --> 43:38.170]  And the reason being is that we want to be able
[43:38.410 --> 43:42.370]  to understand these microfibers.
[43:42.370 --> 43:46.370]  So if we're going to use any type of binder
[43:46.370 --> 43:48.690]  to create other products with them,
[43:48.690 --> 43:51.850]  this would give us an idea of what we're dealing with
[43:51.850 --> 43:55.410]  in the process of trying to create these materials.
[43:55.410 --> 43:59.410]  So now, very quickly,
[43:59.410 --> 44:03.090]  this is an idea of what's happening here at ANA
[44:03.090 --> 44:08.090]  when it comes to working with industrial hemp.
[44:08.330 --> 44:13.010]  A lot of us, everything in yellow is actually active,
[44:13.010 --> 44:18.010]  is being done, and everything in some other color,
[44:18.610 --> 44:21.490]  yeah, well, this is being done also, the cap.
[44:21.490 --> 44:24.090]  That's the packaging work that's being done
[44:24.090 --> 44:25.810]  by Dr. Kusama's lab.
[44:25.810 --> 44:28.330]  And the bottom one, I don't know, I hope you can see it,
[44:28.330 --> 44:32.050]  where this is Bob Welth, OMTC,
[44:32.050 --> 44:35.650]  who's doing something that we call spent hemp.
[44:35.650 --> 44:37.050]  Spent hemp is what we said,
[44:37.050 --> 44:40.370]  once the inflorescence,
[44:42.530 --> 44:46.850]  the floral material is already going through the processing
[44:46.850 --> 44:48.770]  to remove all the CBD,
[44:48.770 --> 44:53.330]  then that's an extensive amount of quantity of biomass
[44:53.330 --> 44:54.690]  that's to be discarded.
[44:54.690 --> 44:58.250]  So the idea is that they're taking this biomass
[44:58.250 --> 45:00.730]  and actually beginning to pelletize it
[45:00.730 --> 45:03.810]  and beginning to put it in the feed for animals.
[45:03.810 --> 45:06.730]  One of the project ideas going in here
[45:07.410 --> 45:10.290]  is to see if those spent hemp material,
[45:10.290 --> 45:14.130]  they would still have residual cannabinoids still in them,
[45:14.130 --> 45:18.410]  and actually create a relaxation process
[45:19.530 --> 45:23.650]  to decrease the stress on weaning cattle
[45:23.650 --> 45:27.330]  when cows are being taken away from their mothers.
[45:27.330 --> 45:29.410]  Their mothers tend to be very stressful,
[45:29.410 --> 45:32.570]  and then this experiment is trying to address this issue
[45:32.570 --> 45:34.690]  of decreasing the stress.
[45:34.690 --> 45:38.570]  So we do have all the other people in different,
[45:38.570 --> 45:40.570]  the lighter colors are people with ideas
[45:40.570 --> 45:44.650]  that we'd like to pursue, which we've yet to begin.
[45:44.650 --> 45:46.090]  So what else do we do here?
[45:46.090 --> 45:50.010]  Well, since we have to work with the community,
[45:50.010 --> 45:54.650]  so this is a concept again with Oregon State,
[45:54.650 --> 45:58.210]  Phyllos Bioscience out of Oregon.
[45:58.210 --> 46:02.090]  They send us some seeds from Phyllos,
[46:02.090 --> 46:07.090]  and then we actually distribute the seeds to local growers,
[46:07.930 --> 46:08.890]  people with interests,
[46:08.890 --> 46:11.410]  all these people are people with license
[46:11.410 --> 46:16.170]  to fund this permit with the state to grow hemp.
[46:16.170 --> 46:18.810]  So, but very small acreage.
[46:18.810 --> 46:22.770]  And then we give each participant
[46:22.770 --> 46:25.730]  a certain amount of seeds of these cultivars.
[46:25.730 --> 46:29.610]  And then to show you how important that this thing is,
[46:29.610 --> 46:33.530]  this is just as few seeds that you see sitting on the table
[46:33.530 --> 46:36.730]  is about $45,000 worth of seeds of material.
[46:36.730 --> 46:39.170]  So it's that difficult to get into this program.
[46:39.170 --> 46:43.250]  So this is why we call it the hemp equity program,
[46:43.250 --> 46:45.890]  trying to get people started in the process.
[46:45.890 --> 46:48.090]  We do teach these people.
[46:48.090 --> 46:50.930]  We bring in experts who know these things
[46:50.930 --> 46:52.930]  to come and speak about it.
[46:52.930 --> 46:55.250]  So these people can have a good start,
[46:55.250 --> 46:59.370]  a good beginning in the process of transitioning into hemp.
[46:59.690 --> 47:04.690]  And at this point, I think I would say,
[47:04.730 --> 47:05.970]  thank you, thank you very much.
[47:05.970 --> 47:08.810]  If I know there are questions,
[47:08.810 --> 47:10.890]  probably in the Q&A or in the chat,
[47:12.170 --> 47:16.170]  finish this proposal, I mean, this presentation
[47:18.330 --> 47:23.050]  with a slide of our pond here at our research station,
[47:23.050 --> 47:26.370]  in which I always make sure if there's a good sunset,
[47:26.370 --> 47:27.810]  I don't miss the picture.
[47:27.810 --> 47:30.490]  So please, thank you very much.
[47:33.010 --> 47:34.250]  Great presentation, Dr. Siever.
[47:34.250 --> 47:37.530]  Thank you so much for an amazing talk.
[47:37.530 --> 47:39.770]  And yes, we do have several questions.
[47:40.930 --> 47:42.970]  So let's see if we can get to all of them
[47:42.970 --> 47:44.330]  before the end of the hour.
[47:48.050 --> 47:49.890]  Would Dr. Siever agree that THC
[47:49.890 --> 47:52.850]  also has medicinal benefits in addition to CBD?
[47:53.370 --> 47:58.010]  I would say, well, again,
[47:58.010 --> 48:01.970]  I'm not a person who've done any kind of experimental work
[48:01.970 --> 48:04.210]  in such a clinical aspect,
[48:04.210 --> 48:09.210]  but I did serve in a committee here at the state level
[48:09.290 --> 48:13.890]  and their attempt to legalize medical cannabis
[48:13.890 --> 48:15.330]  in the state of Alabama.
[48:15.330 --> 48:16.330]  And then in the process,
[48:16.330 --> 48:18.530]  all the experts who came to testify
[48:18.530 --> 48:21.850]  and in front of that committee did,
[48:21.850 --> 48:24.250]  there are people with very good information
[48:24.250 --> 48:26.570]  to support the fact that yes,
[48:26.570 --> 48:31.570]  the THC does have its role in the world of medicine.
[48:33.410 --> 48:35.410]  And also the cannabinoids, yes.
[48:37.210 --> 48:38.130]  Next question.
[48:38.130 --> 48:42.090]  Do you think that we may change the sex statue of plants
[48:42.090 --> 48:44.610]  through manipulating the environmental conditions?
[48:47.090 --> 48:50.610]  The sex, for instance, feminine, female,
[48:52.290 --> 48:56.090]  actually there are proposals out there
[48:56.090 --> 48:59.490]  addressing this issue to be able to,
[49:02.970 --> 49:06.730]  with the use of CRISPR that exists right now
[49:06.730 --> 49:11.730]  and then identifying those very specific sex genes
[49:12.130 --> 49:17.130]  in the plant, the possibility of being able to manipulate
[49:17.330 --> 49:22.090]  and to have very specific seeds that we can say
[49:22.090 --> 49:25.450]  that we know that this plant is only gonna be a female seed,
[49:25.450 --> 49:27.170]  this is gonna be a male seed.
[49:27.170 --> 49:28.770]  That's down the road, I believe.
[49:30.570 --> 49:32.610]  Has there been any work done
[49:32.610 --> 49:35.530]  to observe metal accumulation in the flowers?
[49:37.930 --> 49:42.930]  Well, I believe that in every state,
[49:43.770 --> 49:46.490]  there are rules and regulation
[49:46.490 --> 49:50.330]  that you have to analyze for metal and inflorescence
[49:50.330 --> 49:53.250]  if it's gonna be a consumable of some kind.
[49:53.250 --> 49:55.930]  But in our case here, we will do this.
[49:55.930 --> 50:00.930]  We will, being that we see this high level of accumulation
[50:00.930 --> 50:04.290]  in the leaves and in the stem and the roots,
[50:04.290 --> 50:08.290]  so we are gonna pay close attention to the inflorescence
[50:08.290 --> 50:10.010]  in the next couple of seasons.
[50:10.450 --> 50:13.130]  Are you, excuse me, are you also taking data
[50:13.130 --> 50:16.690]  on the percentage of terpene DLH cultivar produces
[50:16.690 --> 50:19.850]  or just focusing on phytocannabinoids?
[50:21.010 --> 50:25.490]  We're not doing any terpene work at all right now.
[50:25.490 --> 50:27.010]  We know that's very important
[50:27.010 --> 50:30.250]  because that's an extremely important component
[50:30.250 --> 50:35.250]  of the final product of these diseases
[50:35.250 --> 50:36.850]  that we're gonna be seeing.
[50:36.850 --> 50:41.690]  Of these cannabinoids, of these inflorescence.
[50:41.690 --> 50:44.290]  But we are working with some other,
[50:45.370 --> 50:48.970]  again, with some other team across this private industry
[50:48.970 --> 50:52.170]  who's very interested in capturing some of these terpene,
[50:52.170 --> 50:57.170]  but we have not done so here at our research labs at A&M.
[50:58.770 --> 51:02.170]  Will growth at different latitudes impact cannabinoids
[51:02.170 --> 51:04.290]  and phytochemical, in parentheses,
[51:04.290 --> 51:06.650]  they say terpenes, phenolic acids, flavonoids,
[51:07.450 --> 51:09.010]  composition and concentration?
[51:12.120 --> 51:13.760]  Very loaded question.
[51:13.760 --> 51:18.760]  Okay, so will the photo period impact these things?
[51:20.480 --> 51:22.440]  Is this what the question is?
[51:22.440 --> 51:25.560]  If the latitudinal area where the plant is growing
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.000]  affects the cannabinoids.
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.600]  Oh, okay, okay.
[51:28.600 --> 51:33.600]  Well, we know that photo period sensitivity
[51:34.520 --> 51:39.520]  based on the various latitudes and planting date
[51:41.920 --> 51:45.440]  will have an impact on the length of the plant
[51:45.440 --> 51:47.760]  has to complete its complete lifecycle
[51:47.760 --> 51:52.760]  before it respond to photo period.
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.200]  So we would think that this is what would have the impact.
[51:58.200 --> 51:59.400]  That could have an impact
[51:59.400 --> 52:03.480]  and it has to be addressed and studied specifically.
[52:04.360 --> 52:07.520]  But again, we're doing this with Oregon State and New York
[52:07.520 --> 52:10.120]  and most likely we probably will find these details
[52:10.120 --> 52:10.960]  very soon.
[52:12.520 --> 52:15.480]  Are male plants preferred for fiber production?
[52:20.980 --> 52:24.100]  Well, for which type of production?
[52:24.100 --> 52:25.660]  They say for fiber, yeah, for fiber.
[52:25.660 --> 52:29.820]  Okay, well, it doesn't matter if it's male or female,
[52:29.820 --> 52:34.180]  but if you're gonna grow the plant
[52:34.180 --> 52:37.780]  and because right now, even to grow it for fiber,
[52:37.780 --> 52:42.780]  you have to create, you have to do a dioecious set of plant
[52:43.580 --> 52:47.940]  that's gonna have almost a one-to-one male to female
[52:47.940 --> 52:51.540]  and then the direction is simply at 50% male pollination
[52:51.540 --> 52:54.860]  before seeds begin to form in the female plant
[52:54.860 --> 52:58.100]  then you come and cut it down and let it rip for the fiber
[52:58.100 --> 53:02.060]  so you can do the extraction of the fiber.
[53:02.100 --> 53:07.100]  So, again, that goes back to our first question
[53:07.740 --> 53:09.100]  that the question you asked earlier,
[53:09.100 --> 53:11.460]  the idea of being able to know that if you can,
[53:12.660 --> 53:16.180]  sexing the plant where you can know you can have a row
[53:16.180 --> 53:19.580]  that is 100% male, a row that's 100% female,
[53:19.580 --> 53:20.980]  that can happen in the future
[53:20.980 --> 53:23.900]  where you can grow the female for the grain
[53:23.900 --> 53:25.780]  because that's very valuable.
[53:25.780 --> 53:29.300]  And then you can now cut these down,
[53:29.340 --> 53:31.500]  these male for the fiber
[53:31.500 --> 53:36.500]  and then still use the stem of the females for fiber also.
[53:37.300 --> 53:40.060]  But right now it's sort of a 50-50 deal,
[53:40.060 --> 53:43.100]  you have to kill the females in order to get
[53:43.100 --> 53:46.060]  the most fiber off your field.
[53:47.740 --> 53:50.060]  Next question, have you seen any differences
[53:50.060 --> 53:53.780]  in flooding or drought tolerance between cultivars?
[53:53.780 --> 53:58.780]  Well, I did show a slide where we had some plants
[53:59.420 --> 54:01.660]  that was under water stress
[54:01.660 --> 54:06.420]  where at the very early seedling stage,
[54:06.420 --> 54:10.900]  they were under, the roots were basically immersed
[54:12.260 --> 54:16.980]  in standing water and those plants really barely recovered.
[54:16.980 --> 54:18.460]  They recovered to a certain extent
[54:18.460 --> 54:20.820]  but never reached their full potential.
[54:20.820 --> 54:23.540]  So therefore we're seeing that the plant,
[54:23.540 --> 54:25.460]  from this just basic observation
[54:25.460 --> 54:28.860]  that the plant doesn't like a wet root condition.
[54:29.820 --> 54:32.700]  As far as drought is concerned here in Northern Alabama,
[54:32.700 --> 54:35.940]  we have periodic drought during the summer
[54:35.940 --> 54:40.940]  and we are taking, collecting data,
[54:41.540 --> 54:46.540]  looking at time series growth all throughout those period
[54:50.340 --> 54:53.740]  and to see, and we're gonna do some control experiment
[54:53.740 --> 54:56.100]  very soon in indoor to actually pay attention,
[54:56.100 --> 54:57.740]  more detail to the drought.
[54:57.740 --> 55:00.100]  So right now we don't wanna make any speculation
[55:00.100 --> 55:03.340]  that we are observing a response to drought yet.
[55:05.660 --> 55:09.260]  Next question, how can we get a uniform distribution
[55:09.260 --> 55:13.180]  of seeds if broadcast just fits the birds?
[55:15.500 --> 55:20.420]  Well, well, in the slide that I show about,
[55:22.780 --> 55:24.700]  I think all my slides are still here.
[55:24.780 --> 55:27.020]  I probably still can go and show it
[55:27.020 --> 55:29.660]  if my screen is still being shared,
[55:29.660 --> 55:34.660]  is that when we, let me see which slide was it?
[55:35.340 --> 55:36.700]  This one, okay.
[55:42.990 --> 55:46.790]  Yeah, what we did see, we saw very good distribution.
[55:46.790 --> 55:50.590]  We use a basic or Willowbird to, oops,
[55:50.750 --> 55:59.130]  this is, am I still sharing screen with you?
[56:01.050 --> 56:01.890]  Yes.
[56:01.890 --> 56:02.730]  You still can see my screen?
[56:02.730 --> 56:04.690]  Okay, very good, okay.
[56:04.690 --> 56:08.730]  This is an example of the broadcast
[56:08.730 --> 56:11.530]  on the left side of the picture.
[56:11.530 --> 56:13.730]  So these to tell the truth,
[56:13.730 --> 56:16.970]  we had this uniform distribution
[56:16.970 --> 56:21.490]  using a little Willowbird to broadcast the seed
[56:21.490 --> 56:25.290]  because even on a planting as such,
[56:25.290 --> 56:27.890]  you do want your seed to have this kind of one
[56:27.890 --> 56:29.770]  to two inch distance apart.
[56:29.770 --> 56:34.130]  So we were satisfied with the broadcast population.
[56:34.130 --> 56:37.410]  It's just that the birds definitely
[56:37.410 --> 56:39.010]  were very happy with it also.
[56:41.450 --> 56:45.210]  Does plasma help with decontamination
[56:45.210 --> 56:47.770]  for ester propagation?
[56:48.770 --> 56:50.930]  Well, we did,
[56:53.610 --> 56:57.170]  beside doing this hemp work with plasma,
[56:58.770 --> 57:00.090]  I didn't even mention here, I'm sorry,
[57:00.090 --> 57:04.770]  Dr. Leopold, Neal Chembing and our pathologist here
[57:04.770 --> 57:09.050]  did do some work with tomato seeds
[57:09.050 --> 57:12.690]  by infecting, inoculate these tomato seeds
[57:12.690 --> 57:15.530]  with certain microorganism,
[57:15.530 --> 57:17.370]  probably for cerium or something.
[57:17.970 --> 57:21.170]  And then exposing them to plasma
[57:21.170 --> 57:24.970]  and to see if the plasma would sort of
[57:24.970 --> 57:28.370]  have a positive impact in decreasing
[57:28.370 --> 57:29.970]  the proliferation of this disease
[57:29.970 --> 57:31.770]  and impacting germination.
[57:31.770 --> 57:34.810]  So he did find some kind of result.
[57:34.810 --> 57:36.890]  I think he's in the process of putting together
[57:36.890 --> 57:39.770]  a manuscript published that outcome.
[57:39.770 --> 57:44.770]  So we are using plasma for the purpose
[57:45.730 --> 57:50.730]  of sanitization is already something that's out there.
[57:51.450 --> 57:56.450]  So for water and for other type of biological,
[57:56.970 --> 58:00.770]  but we just now actually trying to use it in a plant world.
[58:02.130 --> 58:03.410]  Next question.
[58:05.010 --> 58:06.690]  They're wondering if you can expand
[58:06.690 --> 58:10.730]  on any political barriers, issues or positive experiences
[58:10.730 --> 58:13.850]  with having oversight from the state of Alabama.
[58:15.290 --> 58:19.050]  Oh boy, I hope my state of Alabama people are not listening.
[58:20.930 --> 58:25.170]  Well, no, I'm being very, very upfront here.
[58:26.250 --> 58:29.250]  The state work with us very well.
[58:29.250 --> 58:34.010]  We try, if anything, I probably am the one
[58:34.010 --> 58:35.770]  who give them more of a hard time
[58:35.770 --> 58:39.010]  and not meeting deadline, not following direction.
[58:39.010 --> 58:40.730]  And they always give me the leeway
[58:40.730 --> 58:43.010]  to make sure I correct my path.
[58:43.010 --> 58:46.050]  So I'm very happy with this Alabama State Department
[58:46.050 --> 58:50.770]  of Agriculture, but they are very, very stringent.
[58:50.770 --> 58:54.170]  And I mean, they've declined certain cultivars
[58:54.170 --> 58:57.050]  for us to plant here because of when they vet
[58:57.050 --> 59:00.050]  those cultivars, they don't meet a guideline
[59:00.050 --> 59:02.210]  that they would like to follow here in the state.
[59:02.210 --> 59:07.210]  It does impinge and sort of research direction sometime.
[59:08.850 --> 59:10.290]  The biggest problem I would say,
[59:10.770 --> 59:13.010]  we just mentioned that to our state officials
[59:13.010 --> 59:17.650]  just last week, is that if we can get our seeds
[59:17.650 --> 59:19.850]  that we're receiving from Oregon, from New York,
[59:19.850 --> 59:21.650]  from Kentucky much quicker,
[59:21.650 --> 59:25.650]  because they already been vetted by these universities,
[59:25.650 --> 59:28.210]  so they can send it to us so we can start planting early,
[59:28.210 --> 59:29.490]  that would be great.
[59:29.490 --> 59:33.490]  But they still stand by their guideline
[59:33.490 --> 59:35.970]  that even though those seeds were vetted
[59:35.970 --> 59:38.570]  by these other universities, they too are gonna vet them
[59:38.610 --> 59:41.850]  before they approve them for my use.
[59:41.850 --> 59:46.530]  So that's why we continuously plant late here.
[59:46.530 --> 59:48.890]  We've not been able to plant early.
[59:49.890 --> 59:52.010]  We've not been able to receive our seeds
[59:52.010 --> 59:54.890]  to be approved on time for early planting.
[59:59.290 --> 01:00:00.850]  We are out of time.
[01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:05.850]  I have a few questions left and we can ask a couple.
[01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:10.610]  What basis for sufficient levels for nutrients
[01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:13.450]  were used when growing hemp?
[01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:19.530]  What basis for sufficiency levels for nutrients were used?
[01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.210]  So we, again, being, it's very new.
[01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:30.210]  It's very new to plant hemp to begin the process
[01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.330]  of experimenting with hemp here in the South
[01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.850]  and the U.S. or across the U.S.
[01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:36.410]  But there's a lot of information out of Europe,
[01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:39.250]  out of Australia, out of Israel, out of other places
[01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:42.570]  that gives us sort of an indication
[01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:45.010]  that this is what works for them in their area.
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:50.010]  So when we say we're gonna plant about 45,000 plants
[01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:54.650]  for fiber per acre or seeds per acre
[01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:59.650]  or anywhere from five to 20,000 seedlings
[01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.650]  for essential oil CBD, we're following guidelines
[01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.570]  that's already been established by other people.
[01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.930]  But even though we would like to do these experiments
[01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.730]  over ourselves here.
[01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.970]  Have you observed any issues with powder mildew
[01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:19.330]  or other fungi in your work?
[01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:23.130]  We have not.
[01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:24.850]  We have not.
[01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:28.170]  And I think it's because the last few years
[01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.650]  since we've been growing the hemp here,
[01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:34.650]  we've been having very dry summers, not necessarily,
[01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:42.010]  we've not had much issues with mildews or bipolaris,
[01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:46.010]  the only disease that seemed to have occurred,
[01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:47.130]  but ever so slightly.
[01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:51.610]  So we will have to do some indoor experiment
[01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:54.090]  to do some inoculation ourselves
[01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:57.210]  to look at, to address those issues.
[01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:02.170]  And the one question that I am very curious also is,
[01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.810]  what do you think the future of hemp industry
[01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.370]  leans more towards the production of grain
[01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:09.370]  or fiber or question mark?
[01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:12.970]  Question mark sounds good.
[01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:17.010]  Simply because I personally, well,
[01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:21.730]  giving this as an opinion, is that we are focusing on,
[01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:23.090]  we are focusing on fiber.
[01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:24.490]  As a matter of fact, there's a lot of the thing
[01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:27.810]  that we are doing here with fiber
[01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:30.850]  that I'm not even privy to show you as yet,
[01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:36.330]  to make all different kinds of material with the plant,
[01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:39.130]  even with the stems and so on,
[01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.010]  to improve the quality of the hempcrete.
[01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.530]  But then the fiber itself,
[01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:48.530]  to be able to create those type of graphene, plastic,
[01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:50.970]  all those bio-based material,
[01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:54.810]  which can derive from this high quality fiber,
[01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:56.410]  is still around the corner.
[01:02:56.410 --> 01:03:00.930]  My view, Louis, is that I think the USDA
[01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.650]  and many other agencies should start putting more grant
[01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:08.410]  for SBIR, STTR type of grant,
[01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:13.410]  simply for entrepreneur to begin to produce this product
[01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:17.890]  and create this bio-based world
[01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:19.650]  that we're trying to transition in.
[01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:22.970]  Well, I think we could-
[01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.090]  Pharmaceutical, I'm sorry,
[01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:26.730]  but pharmaceutical is very important too.
[01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:30.930]  I'm sure that the FDA will have it set so
[01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:34.530]  as to when these products can begin to be officially
[01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:36.170]  be infused into our food system.
[01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:38.410]  Definitely.
[01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:39.770]  Well, thank you so much, Dr. Klusiever.
[01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:41.810]  Thank you so much, all of you,
[01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:45.170]  for joining us today for this first of the webinar series.
[01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.090]  Please join us on February 8th
[01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:52.290]  for the propagation talk by Dr. Mark Bridgen.
[01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:56.170]  He's gonna cover all the aspects of hemp propagation
[01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.970]  and his work in in vitro micro propagation.
[01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.250]  So thank you so much, everyone.
[01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.730]  Hope you have a great day and great week.
[01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:06.450]  Thank you.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:14.300]  This has been a production of Cornell University
