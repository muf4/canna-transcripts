[00:00.190 --> 00:04.190]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.190 --> 00:14.740]  So my name is Chris Smart and I am a plant pathologist. I study diseases of plants.
[00:14.740 --> 00:21.740]  My lab focuses on diseases of vegetables, but we have also gotten into diseases of hemp.
[00:21.740 --> 00:25.740]  And today I am here with my student, Patrick McMullen.
[00:25.740 --> 00:36.740]  And the other thing I want to point out again is that Patrick made a really nice handout on root rot issues in hemp.
[00:36.740 --> 00:42.740]  And so if you scan the QR code that is on the agenda, you will pull that up.
[00:42.740 --> 00:52.740]  And all of the handouts from today's field day will be up online at the Cornell hemp website and you will be able to find them there.
[00:52.740 --> 00:54.740]  So Patrick.
[00:54.740 --> 00:57.740]  Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone.
[00:57.740 --> 01:03.740]  So I am a PhD student here working in Chris's lab and I have been working with root rot pathogens of hemp.
[01:03.740 --> 01:11.740]  And I have been working with some root rot pathogens, soil borne pathogens of hemp.
[01:12.740 --> 01:22.740]  Most recently with Pythium. I am sure a lot of you have dealt with Pythium in seedlings and damping off issues in greenhouse and outdoor production.
[01:22.740 --> 01:30.740]  So Pythium is an oomycete pathogen that causes damping off and early seedling death.
[01:31.740 --> 01:41.740]  The swimming oospores really like the water and damp soils and you will experience this disease a lot more in those cool wet climates.
[01:41.740 --> 01:50.740]  So in this experiment I am running now, we have these two flats of seedlings. These are two week old seedlings.
[01:50.740 --> 01:56.740]  The one that Allie over here is holding are just healthy two week old seedlings.
[01:56.740 --> 02:01.740]  Chris's over here, they are dead. There is nothing there.
[02:01.740 --> 02:06.740]  Chris, can you point it over here?
[02:06.740 --> 02:16.740]  So take a look as they bring these flats around and just look at the extreme difference there of what Pythium can do to seeds.
[02:16.740 --> 02:21.740]  My current research interest here is testing control strategies of Pythium.
[02:21.740 --> 02:31.740]  We all know that there are very few labelled products for hemp right now and all of that is currently in the research process to see what is efficacious and what is approved.
[02:31.740 --> 02:37.740]  So here I tested some different seed treatments. I had two copper products and a phosphate product.
[02:37.740 --> 02:42.740]  And as you can see in Chris's flat, none of that seemed to be effective.
[02:42.740 --> 02:49.740]  But of course we are still in the process of testing more seed treatments to help prevent these damping off issues.
[02:49.740 --> 02:52.740]  They are very photogenic.
[02:52.740 --> 02:58.740]  Why don't you explain the experiment, the inoculation, what is it all about?
[02:58.740 --> 03:06.740]  So to do this I planted, these are just styrofoam flats with 128 cell flat, all one seed lot.
[03:06.740 --> 03:10.740]  And they were direct seeded into potting soil.
[03:10.740 --> 03:16.740]  And then these trays were placed in a tub of water and just allowed to float on top.
[03:16.740 --> 03:19.740]  Tobacco is often started in a similar method to this.
[03:19.740 --> 03:26.740]  So then what I did in the inoculated group was I had petri plates of Pythium growing.
[03:26.740 --> 03:32.740]  And we scraped off the spores from those plates and dumped that inoculum into the water.
[03:32.740 --> 03:39.740]  So the spores, the swimming zoospores, could enter the roots and the soil seedlings as they are germinating.
[03:39.740 --> 03:44.740]  And you can see that in this tray here there is practically no root growth coming out of the pot.
[03:44.740 --> 03:49.740]  And then in alleys over here there is all of those healthy white roots.
[03:49.740 --> 03:59.740]  So other signs of Pythium that you will often see if you do have plants that emerge more are kind of a browning of the stem as it does damp off.
[03:59.740 --> 04:03.740]  And brown roots are also quite common.
[04:03.740 --> 04:10.740]  And this is a commonly observed disease in greenhouses and hydroponic production, really anywhere where there is a lot of water.
[04:10.740 --> 04:15.740]  And it can easily be transmitted if there is any kind of splashing of that contaminated material.
[04:15.740 --> 04:23.740]  So right now we don't really have good chemical control strategies, but of course you could employ some good cultural practices,
[04:23.740 --> 04:32.740]  good sanitation methods between your cropping seasons and cycles, and starting with clean planting material.
[04:32.740 --> 04:39.740]  So those are kind of the best information I could give you for Pythium right now.
[04:39.740 --> 04:47.740]  I am also interested in Fusarium, which is another soil-borne pathogen, which causes some similar disease symptoms.
[04:47.740 --> 04:52.740]  You will often see wilting and yellowing on larger plants and eventual plant collapse and death.
[04:52.740 --> 04:56.740]  On young seedlings you can see damping off, similar to what we saw here with Pythium.
[04:56.740 --> 05:02.740]  And we are testing some of the same control strategies for those right now as well.
[05:02.740 --> 05:12.740]  If you scan your QR codes on your schedule, there is a more detailed fact sheet about Fusarium and its life cycle.
[05:12.740 --> 05:16.740]  But similar to Pythium, it also likes those cool wet soils.
[05:16.740 --> 05:22.740]  And it is really an environmental fungus in the soil that persists for a long time.
[05:22.740 --> 05:30.740]  So it is important to have healthy seedlings established that can withstand these soil-borne pathogens and really encourage early brooding.
[05:31.740 --> 05:39.740]  And since these are all soil-borne pathogens, our lab is also interested in the soil health and microbial communities surrounding the roots.
[05:39.740 --> 05:52.740]  So I am currently involved in a soil microbiome study, where we are analyzing and sending off samples of root cores that are around the growing hemp plants in the field.
[05:52.740 --> 06:00.740]  To analyze what microbes are present throughout the growing season, both at transplant and as we progress closer to harvest.
[06:00.740 --> 06:06.740]  So we are interested in what the microbial composition is, what kind of bacteria and fungi are in that area,
[06:06.740 --> 06:18.740]  and how this changes over the season, and how we can use this information to better inform our practices about growing strategies and controls of diseases and pests.
[06:19.740 --> 06:21.740]  And Chris, do you have more to add?
[06:21.740 --> 06:23.740]  I always have more to add.
[06:23.740 --> 06:34.740]  I will say that if you see damping off in your greenhouse or in your field, we would actually be happy to get samples.
[06:34.740 --> 06:40.740]  We want to know which Pythium species, so Pythium as Patrick said is a water mold, it loves water.
[06:40.740 --> 06:46.740]  But here in New York, or in the Northeast, what are we dealing with the most?
[06:46.740 --> 06:53.740]  Because if we are going to be looking at seed treatments or cultivars that may have some resistance,
[06:53.740 --> 06:59.740]  we want to be using the pathogen that you guys are dealing with most frequently.
[06:59.740 --> 07:10.740]  And so anything you can get to us, that will go right into our screen, just to see, oh is it more aggressive, is it less aggressive, what's most common that we see.
[07:10.740 --> 07:17.740]  Or is it just a total mixed bag depending on what Fusarium or Pythium you may have on your farm.
[07:17.740 --> 07:25.740]  I'll also say that soil borne diseases generally are worse in heavy soils.
[07:25.740 --> 07:29.740]  Here in Geneva, they call our soil loam.
[07:29.740 --> 07:34.740]  I think they're using that word remarkably generously for the soils that we have.
[07:35.740 --> 07:44.740]  We do see a lot of puddling, we see some root rot, and it's not a well-drained soil.
[07:44.740 --> 07:52.740]  Anything you can do to increase the drainage, as Patrick said, will certainly enhance the health of the plant and reduce the possibilities of root rot.
[07:52.740 --> 08:01.740]  And then the other thing, I was talking to a few people beforehand, is that hemp is also just very susceptible to flood damage.
[08:01.740 --> 08:06.740]  So sometimes plants will look like this and they simply have drowned.
[08:06.740 --> 08:10.740]  They're not very good at holding up in standing water.
[08:10.740 --> 08:17.740]  So again, anything you can do to enhance the drainage of your soil will certainly help.
[08:17.740 --> 08:26.740]  And the final thing that I always say when I'm at Extension meetings is that while Patrick, as well he should be, is very pleased with this experiment,
[08:27.740 --> 08:33.740]  and we smile a lot about diseased plants, this is a research experiment.
[08:33.740 --> 08:41.740]  We are killing plants in our research labs so that we can learn more about what's happening on the farms in New York.
[08:41.740 --> 08:52.740]  We hope that you never see anything like this, but if you do, let us know because we want to make sure that we're helping everyone that has root rot problems.
[08:53.740 --> 09:00.740]  And this afternoon we'll be talking about powdery mildews, which is also another issue here in New York, and that we'll feature out.
[09:00.740 --> 09:04.740]  So, questions? Yes.
[09:04.740 --> 09:16.740]  What are you doing genetically? Are you doing any plant breeding for pathogen resistance both in soil and for controlling weeds like they have Roundup Ready soybeans and such?
[09:16.740 --> 09:24.740]  So the question is about breeding strategies right now. Are we breeding for resistance to diseases?
[09:24.740 --> 09:30.740]  For Fusarium and Pythium, not currently. We don't know if there's genetic resistance.
[09:30.740 --> 09:36.740]  That's further research projects that could take place, but we just don't have that information currently available.
[09:37.740 --> 09:48.740]  In other pathogens like powdery mildew, which if you come to the afternoon sessions, there are breeding programs taking place here for powdery mildew resistant hemp.
[09:48.740 --> 09:53.740]  So that's currently ongoing work and there's optimistic results with some of that.
[09:53.740 --> 09:55.740]  What about weeds?
[09:55.740 --> 09:57.740]  In the weeds?
[09:57.740 --> 10:14.740]  Yeah, so for weed control, as you were saying, glyphosate resistant plants, we have Faith Hatt, who is here somewhere, has been working on hemp transformation and has both tissue culture and transformation up and running.
[10:14.740 --> 10:23.740]  We currently do not have any plans to put ourselves herbicide resistance genes into hemp.
[10:24.740 --> 10:39.740]  We're really focusing on identifying cultivars, figuring out what the issues are, tackling some of the larger issues, rather than focusing on the regulatory hurdles that come with genetically engineered crops.
[10:40.740 --> 10:48.740]  Actually, the breeding labs can talk more about that. I don't know their plan.
[10:48.740 --> 11:02.740]  They are looking at genetically engineered plants for research purposes to control flowering time and other areas, but to my knowledge, there's nothing that's focused on herbicide resistance.
[11:02.740 --> 11:04.740]  Thank you.
[11:05.740 --> 11:14.770]  Soil-less media?
[11:14.770 --> 11:28.770]  Yeah, so that's... Okay. The question was, do we notice these diseases more readily in different soil-less media versus in the ground soil out here, or differences between greenhouse media we might be using?
[11:28.770 --> 11:39.770]  So the true answer is we don't have the data to support whether one's better than the other, but of course that these pathogens really like the damp, wet soil.
[11:39.770 --> 11:52.770]  If you heard Neil Madsen presenting earlier about the importance of drainage in your potting mixes, you do want that high air porosity, so you're not saturating the plants and making sure that they have good drainage.
[11:52.770 --> 11:54.770]  Those are kind of the best strategies.
[11:54.770 --> 11:56.770]  So anything with high air porosity.
[11:57.770 --> 12:01.770]  Soil-based or organic?
[12:01.770 --> 12:13.810]  So this was... The question was, what are our potting mixes that we used here?
[12:13.810 --> 12:19.810]  So this is a peat potting mix that we just used in our greenhouse space here.
[12:19.810 --> 12:26.810]  We didn't sterilize it before. Often if you do autoclave your soil before planting, it's just more difficult to grow things.
[12:26.810 --> 12:33.810]  There are beneficial microbes that are just always present in the environment, but we didn't add anything else to these treatments.
[12:33.810 --> 12:36.810]  It's just our peat-based potting mixes.
[12:36.810 --> 12:38.810]  And it's micro-isolated?
[12:38.810 --> 12:42.810]  No. Not micro-isolated. Yes, Neil?
[12:42.810 --> 12:51.810]  And if you add temperature to the soil, like if it's like warm temperature, it gets cold and wet together, and it's like a bad compost.
[12:51.810 --> 12:56.810]  Yes. So Neil is talking about environmental temperatures of the roots.
[12:56.810 --> 13:00.810]  So cold and wet are kind of your worst case scenarios for growing hemp.
[13:00.810 --> 13:05.810]  Roots like warm temperatures and well-drained.
[13:05.810 --> 13:10.810]  Of course you need an adequate amount of water, but you don't want them saturated, and you certainly don't want the roots out of the soil.
[13:11.810 --> 13:14.810]  Alright. Thank you. Nice job, Dr.
