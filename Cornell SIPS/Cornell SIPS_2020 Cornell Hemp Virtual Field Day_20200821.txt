[00:00.000 --> 00:07.960]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.960 --> 00:10.840]  OK, it's 9.01.
[00:10.840 --> 00:13.440]  Let's get started.
[00:13.440 --> 00:18.720]  Welcome again, everyone, to our Cornell Hemp Research Team
[00:18.720 --> 00:21.040]  Virtual Field Day.
[00:21.040 --> 00:23.320]  It's a beautiful day here in upstate New York,
[00:23.320 --> 00:25.160]  and I wish you all could be here.
[00:25.160 --> 00:27.680]  We would have had a perfect day in the field.
[00:27.680 --> 00:30.720]  But I'm going to look at the silver lining,
[00:30.720 --> 00:36.640]  and that is that we are now up to 213 attendees, already
[00:36.640 --> 00:39.040]  matching what we had last year.
[00:39.040 --> 00:43.400]  And that was our max capacity of our field facilities.
[00:43.400 --> 00:47.480]  We've also been able to encourage
[00:47.480 --> 00:50.640]  the participation of people across the country
[00:50.640 --> 00:55.000]  and perhaps around the world through this virtual format.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.400]  So I think we're going to have a broader impact.
[00:59.400 --> 01:04.040]  We have a good lineup of speakers today.
[01:04.040 --> 01:07.080]  You see we've broken up the session, the program.
[01:07.080 --> 01:09.320]  We did three sessions, the first one
[01:09.320 --> 01:13.200]  on hemp breeding and genetics, second on crop management,
[01:13.200 --> 01:18.400]  and the third on supply chains and regulatory updates.
[01:18.400 --> 01:21.360]  Some of those presentations will be made live.
[01:21.360 --> 01:24.000]  Some are pre-recorded, and I will play those
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.640]  through my computer.
[01:25.640 --> 01:28.920]  We've allowed a five-minute break at the end of each hour
[01:28.920 --> 01:31.680]  because we've realized now with these long Zoom meetings
[01:31.680 --> 01:35.440]  that people need to take a break for a few minutes,
[01:35.440 --> 01:39.440]  get a cup of coffee, use the restroom, et cetera.
[01:39.440 --> 01:43.560]  So I also want to thank our support
[01:43.560 --> 01:45.440]  from Pixis International.
[01:45.440 --> 01:49.560]  And some of my colleagues from Pixis are on as well.
[01:49.560 --> 01:53.160]  They have sponsored our research now for the second season
[01:53.160 --> 01:54.800]  and have made a strong commitment
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.920]  to extension and outreach to hemp growers across the country.
[02:00.920 --> 02:02.960]  So again, I want to thank them.
[02:02.960 --> 02:05.520]  So without further ado, I'm going
[02:05.520 --> 02:10.800]  to turn the screen over to my graduate student George Stack,
[02:10.800 --> 02:13.880]  who has started in the second year of his PhD, who
[02:13.880 --> 02:17.240]  is going to give you a presentation about some
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.960]  of our cannabinoid hemp trials.
[02:20.960 --> 02:21.440]  George.
[02:22.240 --> 02:22.720]  OK.
[02:22.720 --> 02:23.680]  Can everybody hear me?
[02:23.680 --> 02:24.720]  Larry, can you hear me?
[02:24.720 --> 02:26.080]  Yep, I hear you well.
[02:26.080 --> 02:28.560]  OK.
[02:28.560 --> 02:30.240]  And you can see my screen.
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.180]  Yep, looks perfect.
[02:33.180 --> 02:33.700]  Go for it.
[02:33.700 --> 02:34.900]  OK.
[02:34.900 --> 02:36.700]  As Larry said, my name is George Stack,
[02:36.700 --> 02:39.580]  and I'm starting the second year of my PhD in his lab
[02:39.580 --> 02:40.580]  at Cornell Agritech.
[02:40.580 --> 02:42.140]  Today I'm going to be talking to you
[02:42.140 --> 02:46.260]  about our high cannabinoid hemp cultivar trials from 2019
[02:46.260 --> 02:48.580]  and 2020.
[02:48.580 --> 02:51.260]  Before I kind of dig in, I want to just
[02:51.300 --> 02:55.380]  Before I kind of dig in, I'd like to bring up two points.
[02:55.380 --> 02:59.540]  One is that I have posted two fact sheets on our website,
[02:59.540 --> 03:02.900]  one about the 2019 trial and one about the 2020 trial.
[03:02.900 --> 03:06.260]  So there's data that I'm going to be presenting in this talk,
[03:06.260 --> 03:09.500]  as well as additional data that you can check out there.
[03:09.500 --> 03:11.300]  And the second thing I'd like to bring up
[03:11.300 --> 03:13.820]  is that when I talk about THC in this talk,
[03:13.820 --> 03:16.140]  I'm talking about total THC.
[03:16.140 --> 03:18.740]  So this is a regulatory issue that I don't really
[03:18.740 --> 03:20.620]  have time to dig into right now, but we'll
[03:20.660 --> 03:25.380]  hopefully discuss it later in the field day.
[03:25.380 --> 03:27.620]  Excuse me.
[03:27.620 --> 03:29.500]  So before I talk about the data, we
[03:29.500 --> 03:33.260]  need to understand why different cannabis plants accumulate
[03:33.260 --> 03:34.460]  different cannabinoids.
[03:34.460 --> 03:37.460]  And it comes down to this cannabinoid biosynthetic
[03:37.460 --> 03:38.660]  pathway right here.
[03:38.660 --> 03:41.020]  I'm going to put my pointer on.
[03:41.020 --> 03:43.220]  So we're starting with these precursor compounds
[03:43.220 --> 03:45.380]  that get converted into CBGA.
[03:45.380 --> 03:49.580]  And then the CBGA can get converted into either CBDA
[03:49.580 --> 03:52.860]  by the CBDA synthase enzyme in the plant,
[03:52.860 --> 03:57.900]  or THCA by the THCA synthase enzyme in the plant.
[03:57.900 --> 04:00.860]  And the combination of these two enzymes that a plant has
[04:00.860 --> 04:04.740]  really dictate what cannabinoids it's going to accumulate.
[04:04.740 --> 04:08.260]  So you can imagine if we have a THCA synthase enzyme,
[04:08.260 --> 04:13.100]  but no CBDA synthase enzyme, the plant will accumulate THC.
[04:13.100 --> 04:15.900]  And this is called chemotype 1.
[04:15.900 --> 04:20.540]  If we have both a THCA synthase enzyme and a CBDA synthase
[04:20.540 --> 04:25.020]  enzyme, we'll accumulate both CBDA and THCA.
[04:25.020 --> 04:28.100]  This is called chemotype 2.
[04:28.100 --> 04:32.660]  If we have just a CBDA synthase enzyme and no THCA synthase
[04:32.660 --> 04:34.980]  enzyme, we'll accumulate CBD.
[04:34.980 --> 04:37.660]  This is called chemotype 3.
[04:37.660 --> 04:41.900]  And if we have neither a CBDA synthase enzyme nor a THCA
[04:41.900 --> 04:44.660]  synthase enzyme, we'll accumulate CBG.
[04:44.660 --> 04:47.700]  And this is how you get these high CBG varieties.
[04:47.700 --> 04:50.660]  And this is called chemotype 4.
[04:50.660 --> 04:54.060]  So let's look at this in the context of our 2019 CBD
[04:54.060 --> 04:55.460]  cultivar trial.
[04:55.460 --> 04:58.660]  This trial was replicated at two sites, one in Geneva
[04:58.660 --> 05:00.060]  and one in Ithaca.
[05:00.060 --> 05:03.980]  At each of these sites, we had 30 cultivars replicated.
[05:03.980 --> 05:06.740]  And so one of the questions that we can ask about the trial
[05:06.740 --> 05:10.260]  is what chemotypes showed up in this 2019 trial.
[05:10.260 --> 05:13.780]  Were all of the plants chemotype 3, high CBD plants,
[05:13.780 --> 05:16.820]  as we would expect if we're trying to produce CBD?
[05:16.820 --> 05:19.260]  And the answer to that question is no.
[05:19.260 --> 05:21.260]  So at least seven of the 30 cultivars
[05:21.260 --> 05:23.460]  were not all chemotype 3.
[05:23.460 --> 05:26.140]  So this is some cannabinoid data from one cultivar
[05:26.140 --> 05:30.660]  that had chemotypes 1, 2, and 3 individuals in it.
[05:30.660 --> 05:33.340]  And you can see that the chemotype 1 and chemotype 2
[05:33.340 --> 05:36.900]  individuals accumulated a lot of THC
[05:36.900 --> 05:39.940]  and exceeded the regulatory threshold.
[05:39.940 --> 05:41.700]  So this is a real problem, that growers
[05:41.700 --> 05:45.300]  are being sold chemotype 1 and 2 plants when they're expecting
[05:45.300 --> 05:46.540]  chemotype 3 plants.
[05:46.540 --> 05:50.340]  And it causes them to be not compliant.
[05:50.340 --> 05:51.820]  The second question that we asked
[05:51.820 --> 05:54.940]  was how do cannabinoids accumulate over time?
[05:54.940 --> 05:58.300]  And we did this by taking shoot tip samples weekly
[05:58.300 --> 06:01.900]  after terminal flowering for all of the 30 cultivars.
[06:01.900 --> 06:04.620]  And when we look at the data, it looks like this.
[06:04.620 --> 06:07.260]  So let's look at CBD accumulation over time.
[06:07.260 --> 06:10.980]  We have total potential CBD on our y-axis here.
[06:10.980 --> 06:14.500]  And we have weeks after terminal flowering on our x-axis.
[06:14.500 --> 06:17.620]  Each of these lines is a different one of the cultivars
[06:17.620 --> 06:21.020]  and shows how it accumulates CBD over time.
[06:21.020 --> 06:23.300]  So you can see that for most cultivars,
[06:23.300 --> 06:25.380]  they accumulate quite a lot of CBD
[06:25.380 --> 06:28.140]  in the weeks immediately following terminal flowering.
[06:28.140 --> 06:30.500]  And this makes sense because most of the cannabinoids
[06:30.500 --> 06:34.660]  are concentrated in the trichomes of the female flowers.
[06:34.660 --> 06:35.740]  What's really interesting, though,
[06:35.740 --> 06:39.220]  is when you compare this graph of CBD accumulation
[06:39.220 --> 06:41.740]  to the graph of THC accumulation.
[06:41.740 --> 06:43.100]  And I'll just flip back and forth
[06:43.100 --> 06:45.220]  between these slides a few times here.
[06:45.220 --> 06:46.740]  And you can see that the curves
[06:46.740 --> 06:49.380]  for each of the cultivars are almost identical.
[06:49.380 --> 06:51.260]  It's just that the scales are different.
[06:51.260 --> 06:54.860]  So the scale for the CBD graph was zero to 20,
[06:54.860 --> 06:59.140]  and the scale for this THC graph is zero to 0.6.
[06:59.140 --> 07:01.460]  And the reason the curves are so similar
[07:01.460 --> 07:04.980]  is because CBD and THC accumulation
[07:04.980 --> 07:09.180]  are coupled in high CBD plants at a fixed ratio.
[07:09.980 --> 07:12.460]  And unfortunately, that means these cultivars here
[07:12.460 --> 07:15.380]  that accumulated high levels of CBD
[07:15.380 --> 07:18.140]  also accumulated enough THC
[07:18.140 --> 07:22.380]  to be above this 0.3% total THC legal threshold,
[07:22.380 --> 07:24.540]  which leaves us a very small window
[07:24.540 --> 07:26.980]  to do regulatory testing and harvest
[07:26.980 --> 07:29.540]  before our cultivars become not compliant.
[07:30.660 --> 07:33.500]  And when we look at this CBD to THC ratio
[07:33.500 --> 07:34.980]  across all of our cultivars,
[07:34.980 --> 07:38.780]  we have CBD to THC ratio on our Y-axis here,
[07:38.780 --> 07:41.380]  and CBD to THC ratio on our X-axis.
[07:41.380 --> 07:44.660]  We see that it's pretty consistent for most cultivars
[07:44.660 --> 07:49.180]  between a 20 to one ratio and 30 to one ratio.
[07:49.180 --> 07:50.260]  Excuse me.
[07:50.260 --> 07:54.900]  And that means that at a 0.3% total THC threshold,
[07:54.900 --> 07:56.900]  on average, we can only accumulate
[07:56.900 --> 08:00.340]  about seven to 8% total CBD
[08:00.340 --> 08:02.740]  before a plant becomes not compliant.
[08:03.900 --> 08:05.540]  The third thing I'd like to talk about
[08:05.540 --> 08:07.100]  is when these plants flower
[08:07.140 --> 08:08.660]  during the flowering time.
[08:08.660 --> 08:09.580]  So in this graph here,
[08:09.580 --> 08:12.700]  you can see our cultivars on the Y-axis
[08:12.700 --> 08:14.900]  and the date on the X-axis.
[08:14.900 --> 08:17.580]  This vertical line is when we transplanted,
[08:17.580 --> 08:20.380]  and you can see that these bars indicate
[08:20.380 --> 08:22.500]  when each of the cultivars flowered.
[08:22.500 --> 08:24.820]  So we had some that flowered in June,
[08:24.820 --> 08:27.700]  some in July, some in August,
[08:27.700 --> 08:31.020]  some in September, and one even in October.
[08:31.020 --> 08:32.860]  And I've added these circle Xs
[08:32.860 --> 08:34.340]  to show when these cultivars
[08:34.340 --> 08:38.580]  exceeded the 0.3% total THC legal threshold.
[08:38.580 --> 08:42.260]  And you can see that it's very strongly correlated
[08:42.260 --> 08:46.900]  and has this one to maybe four week window
[08:46.900 --> 08:48.820]  between terminal flowering
[08:48.820 --> 08:52.380]  and exceeding the THC threshold for most cultivars.
[08:53.940 --> 08:57.300]  So in summary, I'm gonna talk about considerations
[08:57.300 --> 09:00.060]  for staying THC compliant when growing for CBD.
[09:00.060 --> 09:01.340]  The first thing we talked about
[09:01.340 --> 09:03.860]  were the different chemotypes of cannabis
[09:04.380 --> 09:05.780]  and how when we're producing CBD,
[09:05.780 --> 09:09.180]  we really want chemotype three plants.
[09:09.180 --> 09:10.460]  The second thing we talked about
[09:10.460 --> 09:12.580]  was the cannabinoid accumulation curves.
[09:12.580 --> 09:14.500]  And so I'm going to stress the importance
[09:14.500 --> 09:16.860]  of regular testing to make sure
[09:16.860 --> 09:18.740]  that you know where you are on that curve
[09:18.740 --> 09:22.820]  and that you're staying under the 0.3% legal threshold.
[09:22.820 --> 09:24.460]  And the third thing I mentioned
[09:24.460 --> 09:27.140]  was that flowering was very strongly correlated
[09:27.140 --> 09:29.180]  with cannabinoid accumulation,
[09:29.180 --> 09:30.900]  which makes sense because cannabinoids
[09:30.900 --> 09:34.020]  are accumulated in the trichomes of the female flowers.
[09:34.020 --> 09:36.220]  So monitoring flowering time
[09:36.220 --> 09:38.500]  is a really good management strategy
[09:38.500 --> 09:41.340]  for staying under that THC threshold.
[09:42.340 --> 09:43.780]  Now I'm gonna briefly talk about
[09:43.780 --> 09:45.580]  our cultivar trials from this year.
[09:45.580 --> 09:49.780]  So we have a CBD cultivar trial and a CBG cultivar trial.
[09:49.780 --> 09:53.660]  So this is chemotype three and chemotype four.
[09:53.660 --> 09:56.460]  Again, we've replicated at two sites,
[09:56.460 --> 09:59.060]  one in Geneva and one in Ithaca.
[09:59.060 --> 10:01.140]  So just to circle around here,
[10:02.060 --> 10:04.380]  in Geneva we have a CBD trial
[10:04.380 --> 10:06.620]  with 40 different cultivars in it.
[10:06.620 --> 10:09.060]  And we also have a CBG trial
[10:09.060 --> 10:11.540]  with 12 different cultivars in it.
[10:11.540 --> 10:13.180]  And over here in Ithaca,
[10:13.180 --> 10:15.660]  we have the replicated CBD trial
[10:15.660 --> 10:17.860]  with 32 of the cultivars in it.
[10:17.860 --> 10:21.420]  And we also have a direct seeded essential oil hemp trial,
[10:21.420 --> 10:24.660]  which is a multi-state trial organized by Oregon State.
[10:24.660 --> 10:27.340]  And this has nine cultivars in it.
[10:27.380 --> 10:29.940]  So I'll just share some preliminary data here
[10:29.940 --> 10:33.700]  from our CBD and CBG cultivar trials.
[10:33.700 --> 10:37.380]  So as of Monday, 21 of the 52 cultivars
[10:37.380 --> 10:39.260]  have started to terminally flower.
[10:39.260 --> 10:41.620]  And I've represented that flowering time
[10:41.620 --> 10:43.140]  in this plot over here.
[10:43.140 --> 10:45.140]  So this is called a violin plot
[10:45.140 --> 10:48.180]  and it shows the distribution of flowering
[10:48.180 --> 10:53.180]  over the course of the last two months or so.
[10:53.500 --> 10:55.540]  And you can see that some cultivars
[10:55.540 --> 10:58.620]  seem to have several distinct groups of flowering time,
[10:58.620 --> 11:00.740]  some early, some late,
[11:00.740 --> 11:02.100]  several appear to flower
[11:02.100 --> 11:04.100]  just over the course of multiple weeks,
[11:04.100 --> 11:06.460]  but not be really separated into groups.
[11:06.460 --> 11:10.660]  And some all flower very consistently at the same time.
[11:10.660 --> 11:12.220]  So it'll be interesting to see
[11:12.220 --> 11:15.260]  how these cultivars continue to mature
[11:15.260 --> 11:16.900]  over the rest of the growing season
[11:16.900 --> 11:20.660]  and how the other 31 cultivars that haven't flowered yet
[11:20.660 --> 11:22.220]  will fit into this scheme.
[11:23.420 --> 11:24.420]  So I'll just say thank you
[11:24.420 --> 11:26.820]  to all of the people who contributed to this research
[11:26.820 --> 11:29.060]  and our funding sources.
[11:29.060 --> 11:31.700]  Please put your questions in the chat
[11:31.700 --> 11:33.020]  and I'd be happy to answer them.
[11:33.020 --> 11:34.780]  And this is my contact info
[11:34.780 --> 11:37.060]  if you'd like to talk more about that.
[11:37.060 --> 11:37.900]  Thank you.
[11:44.740 --> 11:45.580]  That's great.
[11:45.580 --> 11:46.460]  Thanks very much, George.
[11:46.460 --> 11:48.740]  We're going to try to get on time here
[11:48.740 --> 11:53.620]  and make sure that my sharing of the videos here is working.
[11:53.620 --> 11:58.340]  We have time for Q&A at the end of the hour.
[11:58.340 --> 12:00.140]  So I think there will be plenty of time
[12:00.140 --> 12:02.020]  for George to answer your questions.
[12:03.100 --> 12:06.620]  So it's my pleasure now to introduce Jacob Toth,
[12:06.620 --> 12:08.940]  another PhD student in my lab,
[12:09.860 --> 12:13.260]  who will give you a complimentary talk
[12:13.260 --> 12:18.260]  on our molecular breeding for a compliant fiber type.
[12:22.860 --> 12:25.820]  Hello and welcome everybody to the Cornell Hemp Field Days.
[12:25.820 --> 12:26.980]  My name is Jacob Toth
[12:26.980 --> 12:29.740]  and I'm a PhD candidate in Larry's Smart Lab.
[12:30.100 --> 12:33.100]  And today I'll be talking about molecular breeding of hemp.
[12:35.720 --> 12:36.880]  For my talk today,
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.520]  I'll be discussing some of the theory and ideas
[12:40.520 --> 12:42.480]  behind molecular breeding of hemp
[12:42.480 --> 12:45.040]  and give an example of how we're using molecular breeding
[12:45.040 --> 12:46.360]  in our research program
[12:46.360 --> 12:49.440]  to develop a high yielding fiber cultivar
[12:49.440 --> 12:52.880]  that has low levels of THC to stay compliant
[12:52.880 --> 12:55.720]  as well as produces high levels of CBD.
[12:57.760 --> 13:00.720]  It is important to recognize the contribution of genetics
[13:00.720 --> 13:02.920]  and environment to your trade of interest
[13:02.920 --> 13:04.840]  for any breeding endeavor.
[13:04.840 --> 13:07.600]  So how the plant grows, the phenotype,
[13:07.600 --> 13:11.240]  is there about, there's the result of both the genetics
[13:11.240 --> 13:13.600]  of the plant as well as the environment.
[13:13.600 --> 13:16.960]  The genetics of the plant, also known as the genotype,
[13:16.960 --> 13:20.400]  refers to the DNA of the plant,
[13:20.400 --> 13:24.360]  the genes and other DNA, which make up the plant's genome.
[13:25.280 --> 13:27.520]  So many important traits such as yields
[13:28.400 --> 13:30.840]  are heavily influenced by both the genotype
[13:30.840 --> 13:32.240]  and the environment,
[13:32.240 --> 13:34.680]  but some traits such as photoperiod dependence
[13:34.680 --> 13:37.280]  and cannabinoid type are heavily influenced
[13:37.280 --> 13:38.600]  by genotype alone.
[13:39.440 --> 13:41.040]  Concerning photoperiod dependence,
[13:41.040 --> 13:42.880]  if you look at this picture here,
[13:42.880 --> 13:45.720]  the small plant is photoperiod independent
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.600]  and started flowering almost immediately after planting,
[13:49.600 --> 13:53.000]  while the larger plant, which is photoperiod dependent,
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.960]  didn't start flowering until the night length
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.480]  hit a certain threshold.
[13:58.760 --> 14:01.600]  So another important trait that is influenced heavily
[14:01.600 --> 14:05.280]  by genotype in cannabis is cannabinoid type.
[14:05.280 --> 14:07.360]  And breeding for cannabinoid type
[14:07.360 --> 14:10.000]  is a fundamental part of any hemp breeding.
[14:13.430 --> 14:14.990]  So what is molecular breeding?
[14:15.990 --> 14:19.710]  So in molecular breeding, very broadly,
[14:19.710 --> 14:22.190]  instead of just looking at the phenotype of the plant,
[14:22.190 --> 14:25.590]  which is the result of both the genotype and the environment,
[14:25.590 --> 14:28.790]  you look at the actual DNA.
[14:30.270 --> 14:32.790]  So advances in molecular biology
[14:32.790 --> 14:36.990]  have allowed much easier analysis of DNA.
[14:36.990 --> 14:41.710]  And because the DNA is the same in every cell of a plant,
[14:41.710 --> 14:44.230]  whether it's young or whether it's old,
[14:44.230 --> 14:47.230]  being able to assay a plant just by looking at the DNA
[14:47.230 --> 14:49.830]  allows you to look at certain traits
[14:49.830 --> 14:52.150]  before they're even expressed.
[14:52.150 --> 14:54.110]  For instance, to determine if a plant
[14:54.110 --> 14:55.510]  is going to be male or female,
[14:55.510 --> 14:59.470]  or if it's going to produce mostly THC or mostly CBD.
[15:01.310 --> 15:03.590]  So with molecular breeding,
[15:03.590 --> 15:07.430]  you can develop new cultivars based on the genotype alone.
[15:07.430 --> 15:09.910]  And when done accurately,
[15:09.910 --> 15:13.390]  this can result in less expensive phenotyping
[15:13.390 --> 15:15.830]  and ultimately reducing the cost
[15:15.830 --> 15:19.430]  and reducing the time it takes to develop a new cultivar.
[15:23.210 --> 15:24.610]  Now I'm going to talk a little bit
[15:24.610 --> 15:27.810]  about how our research group is using molecular breeding
[15:27.810 --> 15:32.130]  to develop new elite, high yielding fiber cultivars
[15:32.130 --> 15:34.530]  that have compliant levels of THC.
[15:35.450 --> 15:37.890]  In 2019, we grew several varieties
[15:37.890 --> 15:39.770]  for grain and fiber production,
[15:39.770 --> 15:43.930]  including two cultivars from China called Dama and Puma.
[15:43.930 --> 15:45.450]  We didn't know much about these cultivars
[15:45.450 --> 15:46.770]  when we first planted them,
[15:46.770 --> 15:49.730]  aside from a little blurb for Puma,
[15:49.730 --> 15:52.610]  which claimed to have high CBD seeds,
[15:52.610 --> 15:54.530]  high leaves and flowers output.
[15:55.770 --> 15:56.930]  When these plants were grown,
[15:56.930 --> 15:58.810]  we were quite impressed by the plants
[15:58.810 --> 16:00.930]  in that they had extremely large leaves
[16:00.930 --> 16:03.130]  and extremely fast growth rate
[16:03.130 --> 16:05.650]  and would routinely hit 10 feet tall.
[16:06.810 --> 16:08.290]  When we harvested these plants
[16:08.290 --> 16:10.850]  and readied them to measure the fiber yield,
[16:10.850 --> 16:12.490]  we found that Dama and Puma
[16:12.490 --> 16:14.730]  had nearly double the biomass yield
[16:14.730 --> 16:17.330]  of other elite cultivars grown for fiber.
[16:18.570 --> 16:20.330]  Because of this, we thought that Dama and Puma
[16:20.330 --> 16:22.890]  would make excellent fiber cultivars.
[16:22.890 --> 16:26.530]  However, when we looked at the cannabinoids,
[16:26.530 --> 16:29.090]  we found that both Puma and Dama
[16:29.090 --> 16:32.890]  produced THC at levels exceeding 0.3%
[16:32.890 --> 16:34.410]  and would be non-compliant
[16:35.530 --> 16:38.170]  in the modern regulatory framework.
[16:40.290 --> 16:42.090]  We looked further at the cannabinoids
[16:42.090 --> 16:44.090]  that Puma and Dama were producing,
[16:44.090 --> 16:47.250]  and we found that they were relatively high in cannabinoids,
[16:47.250 --> 16:51.210]  with Puma producing a little over 1.5% total cannabinoids
[16:51.210 --> 16:55.210]  and Dama sometimes exceeding 2% total cannabinoids.
[16:55.210 --> 16:57.490]  This is considerably higher
[16:57.490 --> 17:01.210]  than what other fiber cultivars produced
[17:01.210 --> 17:03.410]  in terms of total cannabinoids.
[17:03.410 --> 17:05.770]  Additionally, we sampled these plants
[17:05.770 --> 17:07.810]  when they were just starting to flower,
[17:07.810 --> 17:11.450]  so we hypothesized that as the plant became more mature,
[17:11.450 --> 17:14.290]  the total cannabinoids would increase even further.
[17:14.290 --> 17:18.490]  However, the big problem was that Puma and Dama
[17:18.490 --> 17:22.410]  produced THC as a major cannabinoid,
[17:22.410 --> 17:23.250]  which isn't what we wanted.
[17:23.250 --> 17:26.890]  So ultimately, what we would like in a cultivar
[17:26.890 --> 17:30.170]  would be something that produces as much dry biomass
[17:30.170 --> 17:31.930]  as Puma and Dama,
[17:31.930 --> 17:36.610]  but instead of producing THC, produces CBD.
[17:36.610 --> 17:39.970]  And to achieve that goal, we turned to molecular breeding.
[17:42.620 --> 17:46.060]  So to understand what we did for molecular breeding,
[17:46.060 --> 17:49.620]  it's first important to understand the different chemotypes
[17:49.620 --> 17:51.460]  that are found in cannabis.
[17:52.580 --> 17:54.700]  So there are three important chemotypes
[17:54.700 --> 17:55.740]  that I'll talk about right now.
[17:55.740 --> 17:58.980]  There's type one, which is mostly THC.
[17:58.980 --> 18:01.780]  There's type two, which is CBD to THC
[18:01.780 --> 18:06.060]  in about a two to one ratio, but this number can vary.
[18:06.060 --> 18:09.620]  And then there's type three, which produces mostly CBD.
[18:10.540 --> 18:15.260]  So if you're growing a population or a cultivar for CBD,
[18:15.260 --> 18:18.020]  you'd expect all the plants to be type three,
[18:18.020 --> 18:19.940]  but in 2018 and 2019,
[18:19.940 --> 18:23.260]  we found that some of the plants that we were growing
[18:23.260 --> 18:26.100]  were in fact type two or even type one,
[18:26.100 --> 18:28.100]  producing almost no CBD.
[18:29.180 --> 18:31.980]  Using this data and this figure in the top here
[18:31.980 --> 18:36.140]  shows data from 2018, we developed a molecular marker,
[18:36.140 --> 18:38.020]  which looks at the DNA of the plants
[18:38.060 --> 18:40.700]  and can distinguish type one from type two
[18:40.700 --> 18:42.540]  and type three plants.
[18:43.460 --> 18:46.260]  So getting back to Bama and Puma,
[18:46.260 --> 18:49.340]  when we were looking at the THC to CBD ratio
[18:49.340 --> 18:54.340]  for these plants, we saw that it was about a two to one
[18:54.460 --> 18:57.500]  ratio of CBD to THC, which would suggest
[18:57.500 --> 19:01.380]  that most of the plants that we were sampling were type two.
[19:02.260 --> 19:04.660]  So an interesting thing about these type two plants
[19:04.660 --> 19:06.460]  is that they won't breed true.
[19:07.340 --> 19:10.380]  If there's a population, which is freely intercrossing
[19:10.380 --> 19:12.140]  with a lot of these type two plants,
[19:12.140 --> 19:15.860]  you'd expect to see a certain number to be type one
[19:15.860 --> 19:18.060]  and a certain number to be type three.
[19:19.060 --> 19:22.860]  So we didn't have the HPLC, the chemical data
[19:22.860 --> 19:25.900]  on a lot of different plants from Bama and Puma,
[19:25.900 --> 19:28.660]  we were just looking at pooled samples,
[19:28.660 --> 19:31.620]  but we could apply this molecular marker
[19:31.620 --> 19:35.380]  to these populations and distinguish the different plants
[19:35.380 --> 19:37.460]  that were in these different chemotypes.
[19:38.420 --> 19:40.220]  So late last year, around December,
[19:40.220 --> 19:43.300]  we grew about a hundred plants each of Bama and Puma
[19:43.300 --> 19:45.860]  and tested them with this marker that we developed.
[19:45.860 --> 19:49.060]  And as expected, we found that about half of the plants
[19:49.060 --> 19:51.700]  were type two, and we found that about a third
[19:51.700 --> 19:53.260]  of the plants were type three,
[19:53.260 --> 19:55.140]  and then the remainder were type one.
[19:56.140 --> 20:00.180]  So what we did was we selected the type three,
[20:00.180 --> 20:03.820]  and in theory, these plants should form an excellent basis
[20:03.860 --> 20:06.580]  for a high producing fiber cultivar
[20:07.460 --> 20:10.180]  that produces mostly CBD.
[20:13.020 --> 20:17.060]  However, after selection of these type three plants,
[20:17.060 --> 20:20.020]  we run into a few problems with their propagation.
[20:20.020 --> 20:22.540]  So these plants, which are so vigorous in the field,
[20:22.540 --> 20:25.580]  are also very vigorous in a greenhouse,
[20:25.580 --> 20:28.220]  and they grew extremely fast and extremely tall,
[20:28.220 --> 20:31.260]  sometimes an axis of 14 feet.
[20:31.300 --> 20:33.500]  They were also quite susceptible
[20:33.500 --> 20:35.620]  to various greenhouse pathogens,
[20:35.620 --> 20:38.220]  such as thrips and spider mites.
[20:38.220 --> 20:40.260]  To make matters worse,
[20:40.260 --> 20:42.980]  they appear to be very photoperiod dependent
[20:42.980 --> 20:46.180]  and did not flower in the greenhouse in the spring
[20:46.180 --> 20:48.180]  when we were growing them.
[20:48.180 --> 20:51.140]  There were also some issues with cutting propagation.
[20:51.140 --> 20:53.780]  These plants form a very nice single stem,
[20:53.780 --> 20:55.780]  as you can see in this photo here,
[20:56.820 --> 21:00.020]  but it's not always simple to take a cutting
[21:00.020 --> 21:02.060]  and root that very nice stem.
[21:02.980 --> 21:04.420]  So to address this,
[21:04.420 --> 21:06.900]  we're attempting to grow the plants in the field.
[21:06.900 --> 21:08.220]  We've planted them out,
[21:08.220 --> 21:11.540]  and hopefully we'll harvest some grain
[21:11.540 --> 21:13.020]  at the end of the season,
[21:13.020 --> 21:16.140]  which will form a good basis for scale up.
[21:16.140 --> 21:19.220]  And we've also sent the cuttings of these plants
[21:19.220 --> 21:21.300]  to a collaborator in Florida,
[21:21.300 --> 21:25.500]  who should be able to grow the plants without any issue.
[21:26.500 --> 21:30.820]  In summary, molecular breeding involves selection
[21:30.820 --> 21:33.340]  on the genotype, on the DNA directly.
[21:34.500 --> 21:37.500]  Bama and Puma, two cultivars from China,
[21:37.500 --> 21:39.420]  are high biomass producers,
[21:39.420 --> 21:43.180]  but they produce high non-compliant levels of THC.
[21:44.220 --> 21:47.620]  Selection in Bama and Puma for chemotype three plants
[21:47.620 --> 21:50.100]  using a molecular marker should produce
[21:50.100 --> 21:52.660]  a high-yielding compliant thiocultivar.
[21:53.660 --> 21:57.500]  These plants here growing in the field in New York
[21:57.500 --> 22:02.500]  should form the basis of a new compliant thiocultivar.
[22:02.700 --> 22:05.580]  We hope to harvest the seeds at the end of the season,
[22:05.580 --> 22:06.740]  scale them up,
[22:06.740 --> 22:09.220]  ensure that the resulted plants
[22:09.220 --> 22:11.820]  have the same biomass potential
[22:11.820 --> 22:15.780]  as their parent Bama and Puma populations,
[22:15.780 --> 22:19.300]  and eventually, potentially release new cultivars.
[22:24.460 --> 22:26.780]  Okay, thanks very much, Jacob.
[22:26.780 --> 22:31.780]  We are now going to switch to my postdoc, Craig Carlson,
[22:32.580 --> 22:36.940]  who is out at the field in one of our breeding trials.
[22:36.940 --> 22:41.340]  So Craig is going to talk about some F1 hybrids
[22:41.340 --> 22:44.180]  that he has produced and show you some of their traits.
[22:47.480 --> 22:49.200]  All righty, Larry, can you see me?
[22:51.120 --> 22:52.480]  Yes, we can.
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.760]  All right.
[22:54.400 --> 22:55.440]  Hello, everybody.
[22:55.440 --> 22:56.760]  My name is Craig Carlson.
[22:56.760 --> 22:59.320]  I'm a postdoc with Cornell Hemp.
[22:59.320 --> 23:03.960]  I work on breeding genetics and genomics of hemp.
[23:03.960 --> 23:06.840]  And I've got Chris Smart here with me recording,
[23:06.840 --> 23:09.680]  and we are more than six feet apart.
[23:09.680 --> 23:14.120]  So let's get this thing rolling.
[23:15.080 --> 23:18.520]  So if you've been with the hemp industry
[23:18.520 --> 23:20.880]  for about three or four years,
[23:20.880 --> 23:24.080]  you'll know that there is a big need
[23:24.080 --> 23:26.040]  for cultivar development.
[23:26.920 --> 23:31.920]  For many years, we've seen uniformity in the field
[23:32.560 --> 23:34.720]  in grain and fiber cultivars,
[23:35.560 --> 23:40.560]  but we've also seen a lot of issues with uniformity
[23:41.480 --> 23:44.320]  in high cannabinoid cultivars.
[23:45.320 --> 23:47.080]  So we're standing in our breeding
[23:47.080 --> 23:49.320]  and selection trial right now.
[23:49.320 --> 23:52.400]  And this trial consists of 24 families
[23:53.960 --> 23:58.960]  of 24 individuals crossed with a common parent, TJ,
[23:59.840 --> 24:01.920]  and that's owned by STEM Holdings.
[24:01.920 --> 24:05.480]  It's been kind of our model hemp plant
[24:05.480 --> 24:07.280]  for the past three or four years.
[24:08.360 --> 24:13.160]  So typically when we conduct these high cannabinoid trials,
[24:13.160 --> 24:15.840]  we'll space plants about four feet apart
[24:15.840 --> 24:17.880]  and have about six foot alleys.
[24:19.480 --> 24:23.200]  We'll do weekly measurements of plant height.
[24:24.440 --> 24:29.240]  We'll look at leaf area, branching angle,
[24:30.400 --> 24:35.400]  number of nodes within the canopy, plant canopy width.
[24:36.680 --> 24:40.200]  And so we can get a nice shape descriptor
[24:40.200 --> 24:41.760]  for those individuals.
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.880]  And that's what I've seen is really lacking
[24:43.880 --> 24:46.960]  in the literature is,
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.560]  is shape descriptors that are very basic, right?
[24:54.520 --> 24:59.520]  So tree form, globe shape, columnar, et cetera.
[25:01.480 --> 25:06.480]  So all of these families have been crossed with TJ
[25:06.800 --> 25:11.200]  or an inbred S1 or S2 of TJ.
[25:12.120 --> 25:14.920]  What I wanna show you is how some of these phenotypes
[25:14.920 --> 25:16.920]  are segregating in these families.
[25:17.760 --> 25:19.880]  Because TJ is actually quite heterozygous,
[25:20.720 --> 25:24.880]  but the parents are heterozygous to more inbred.
[25:24.880 --> 25:29.880]  So I wanna show you kind of what our important traits
[25:29.880 --> 25:34.880]  are doing in the field and the differences
[25:35.360 --> 25:39.000]  between crossing heterozygous with heterozygous
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.120]  and heterozygous with inbred material.
[25:41.960 --> 25:44.600]  So if we can get Chris to move over here.
[25:45.560 --> 25:50.560]  This row right here is a TJ's S2,
[25:51.280 --> 25:55.600]  meaning that we selfed TJ's using STS
[25:55.600 --> 25:57.600]  to produce pollen, silver thiosulfate,
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.560]  selected an individual and then selfed that progeny
[26:04.440 --> 26:05.360]  from that individual.
[26:05.360 --> 26:07.840]  So it's an S2 population.
[26:07.840 --> 26:09.720]  And what I was going for with this family
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.400]  was to select an S1 that looked a lot more like the parent.
[26:15.440 --> 26:19.200]  But what we are finding out, what we have found out
[26:19.200 --> 26:22.000]  is that TJ is actually heterozygous
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.120]  for a flowering time gene.
[26:26.400 --> 26:29.920]  And so this is an S2 family in this row.
[26:29.920 --> 26:34.600]  And what we see is that a lot of these early flowering
[26:34.600 --> 26:38.200]  individuals are fairly uniform.
[26:38.200 --> 26:42.200]  And many of the later flowering individuals
[26:42.200 --> 26:43.440]  are fairly uniform.
[26:44.440 --> 26:47.360]  So there is some uniformity,
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.520]  but it's just so dramatic what differences
[26:51.520 --> 26:54.800]  in flowering time can do to a family.
[26:55.800 --> 26:57.640]  So if we wanna come over here, Chris,
[26:59.240 --> 27:02.760]  we're gonna look at another family, another S2.
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.680]  And okay.
[27:08.680 --> 27:11.600]  All right, Chris, this is TJ.
[27:11.600 --> 27:15.360]  This is that common parent of all of these F1s.
[27:15.360 --> 27:18.480]  It has a really irregular shape to it,
[27:18.480 --> 27:19.880]  kind of drooping leaves.
[27:19.880 --> 27:23.400]  It's a high cannabinoid hemp type.
[27:24.440 --> 27:27.480]  I also, in that S1, made a selection
[27:27.480 --> 27:30.800]  of a early flowering individual.
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.440]  So it's kind of homozygous for that flowering time gene.
[27:34.440 --> 27:38.400]  And as you can see, it's far more uniform
[27:39.400 --> 27:44.320]  besides differences really in maybe plant size,
[27:44.320 --> 27:47.280]  but small differences in plant size.
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.800]  And it's far more uniform than that other S1
[27:50.800 --> 27:53.800]  that was segregating for the flowering time locus.
[27:53.800 --> 27:58.800]  There are some really interesting families.
[28:02.740 --> 28:04.020]  Yeah, okay.
[28:04.020 --> 28:05.740]  They got dropped again.
[28:05.740 --> 28:09.060]  So we are going to move on to our next presentation.
[28:09.220 --> 28:12.300]  Chris, we're gonna move on?
[28:13.260 --> 28:14.420]  Yeah, we're gonna move on.
[28:14.420 --> 28:15.420]  We're gonna move on.
[28:18.300 --> 28:23.300]  Okay, and Craig is gonna run into the office here
[28:23.340 --> 28:25.180]  so he can join our Q&A.
[28:26.100 --> 28:30.300]  So our next presentation is from Jamie Crawford.
[28:30.300 --> 28:31.540]  Good morning, everybody.
[28:34.020 --> 28:37.380]  Who will be talking about our grain and fiber trials,
[28:38.540 --> 28:40.140]  mostly in Ithaca.
[28:40.980 --> 28:43.860]  So let me get that going for you.
[28:45.900 --> 28:46.940]  Good morning, everyone.
[28:46.940 --> 28:48.260]  My name is Jamie Crawford,
[28:48.260 --> 28:50.180]  and I'll be giving you a brief update
[28:50.180 --> 28:53.500]  on our hemp, grain, and fiber trials.
[28:53.500 --> 28:56.140]  Our trial design is a randomized complete block
[28:56.140 --> 28:59.140]  where each entry is replicated four times.
[28:59.140 --> 29:01.820]  Plots are four feet wide and 20 feet long,
[29:01.820 --> 29:04.820]  and seeding rate is calculated based on the germination rate
[29:04.820 --> 29:07.060]  and seed weight of each entry.
[29:07.060 --> 29:09.620]  So the 20 live seeds are planted per square foot
[29:09.620 --> 29:11.540]  in the grain in dual trials,
[29:11.540 --> 29:14.220]  and 40 live seeds are planted per square foot
[29:14.220 --> 29:16.260]  in the fiber trials.
[29:16.260 --> 29:18.540]  Complete hemp, grain, and fiber reports for each year
[29:18.540 --> 29:20.020]  can be found on our website,
[29:20.020 --> 29:22.180]  but this graph shows the range of grain yields
[29:22.180 --> 29:24.780]  in Ithaca and Geneva by year.
[29:24.780 --> 29:28.660]  The yields for 2017 and 2019 were quite similar,
[29:28.660 --> 29:32.420]  ranging from 700 to 800 pounds per acre
[29:32.420 --> 29:34.140]  for the lower yielding entries
[29:34.140 --> 29:36.540]  to 1,300 to 1,400 pounds per acre
[29:36.540 --> 29:39.140]  in the higher yielding entries.
[29:39.140 --> 29:43.900]  Decrease in yield in 2018 was due to the timing of harvest.
[29:43.900 --> 29:45.940]  One location was harvested too early
[29:45.940 --> 29:49.020]  before grain was mature in all entries,
[29:49.020 --> 29:51.180]  and one location was harvested too late
[29:51.180 --> 29:54.020]  with much of the grain lost to shattering our birds.
[29:54.020 --> 29:57.740]  When harvesting for grain, timing is very important.
[29:57.740 --> 30:01.460]  Fiber yields in 2017 were low due to poor seed quality
[30:01.460 --> 30:03.220]  and very thin stands.
[30:03.220 --> 30:07.660]  With new higher germinating seed lots in 2018 and 2019,
[30:07.660 --> 30:10.500]  entries were yielding between five and six dry tons per acre
[30:10.500 --> 30:13.340]  before redding and two and a half to three and a half
[30:13.340 --> 30:16.340]  dry tons per acre after redding.
[30:16.340 --> 30:18.140]  We established grain and fiber trials
[30:18.140 --> 30:20.020]  in two locations this spring,
[30:20.020 --> 30:22.660]  the first in Geneva, planted on June 4th,
[30:22.660 --> 30:26.180]  and the second, planted in Ithaca on June 6th.
[30:26.180 --> 30:29.020]  Ithaca had received six-tenths of an inch more rain
[30:29.020 --> 30:32.740]  than in Geneva in the two weeks leading up to planting,
[30:32.740 --> 30:37.060]  and this made a huge difference in the success of the trials.
[30:37.060 --> 30:40.380]  Because the field was so dry when it was prepped for planting,
[30:40.380 --> 30:44.260]  hard-baked chunks of soil limited seed-soil contact.
[30:44.260 --> 30:46.780]  Had we received the predicted rain, it could have been okay,
[30:46.780 --> 30:49.060]  but the lack of rain in the weeks after planting
[30:49.060 --> 30:50.420]  led to poor emergence,
[30:50.420 --> 30:53.540]  and then the trial was overrun by weeds.
[30:53.540 --> 30:56.300]  The additional soil moisture at the Ithaca location
[30:56.300 --> 30:58.980]  led to a finer seed bed, excellent emergence,
[30:58.980 --> 31:01.820]  and what should have been an excellent stand
[31:01.820 --> 31:04.740]  if our cone seeder hadn't been slowly breaking
[31:04.740 --> 31:06.340]  as we were planting.
[31:07.180 --> 31:09.060]  While we were planting the Ithaca trials,
[31:09.060 --> 31:11.140]  the load bar which supported the packer wheels
[31:11.140 --> 31:12.740]  was slowly twisting,
[31:12.740 --> 31:14.460]  planting some of the rows more deeply
[31:14.460 --> 31:17.780]  and packing the soil over top of them very firmly.
[31:17.780 --> 31:20.100]  We planted the fiber trial first that day,
[31:20.100 --> 31:21.940]  and all six rows emerged,
[31:21.940 --> 31:23.780]  but by the last plot planted that day,
[31:23.780 --> 31:26.660]  only two rows emerged as expected.
[31:26.660 --> 31:27.860]  The planter was repaired,
[31:27.860 --> 31:29.540]  and then the grain and dual-purpose trials
[31:29.540 --> 31:32.140]  were replanted on June 24th.
[31:32.140 --> 31:35.380]  Since these hemp varieties are photoperiod-sensitive,
[31:35.380 --> 31:37.780]  planting later leads to shorter plants.
[31:37.780 --> 31:39.460]  The tops of the signs in both pictures
[31:39.460 --> 31:41.260]  are 30 inches from the ground.
[31:41.260 --> 31:42.900]  Piccolo planted the beginning of June
[31:42.900 --> 31:44.500]  is close to four feet tall.
[31:44.500 --> 31:48.020]  Piccolo planted the end of June is two and a half feet tall.
[31:48.020 --> 31:50.580]  Canola is over five feet tall in the original planting
[31:50.580 --> 31:53.420]  and not quite four feet tall in the replant.
[31:53.420 --> 31:55.380]  We expect the grain yields to be similar
[31:55.380 --> 31:56.840]  between these trials,
[31:56.840 --> 31:59.780]  but shorter entries are more susceptible to weed pressure.
[32:01.020 --> 32:02.020]  For my remaining time,
[32:02.020 --> 32:04.700]  I'd like to show you some pictures of our trials
[32:04.700 --> 32:06.100]  here in Ithaca, New York.
[32:06.100 --> 32:08.500]  We'll start out with the fiber trial.
[32:08.500 --> 32:11.020]  The fiber trial was planted on June 6th,
[32:11.020 --> 32:14.620]  so it's from the original planting and has four entries.
[32:15.620 --> 32:17.460]  There are two new entries this year.
[32:17.460 --> 32:20.940]  The one on the left is called Yuma Crossbow.
[32:20.940 --> 32:23.060]  We had some conflicting information
[32:23.060 --> 32:25.380]  on whether it should be included in the dual-purpose
[32:25.380 --> 32:27.020]  or the fiber trial,
[32:27.020 --> 32:30.220]  and as you can see here, we made the wrong choice.
[32:30.220 --> 32:32.500]  It's actually earlier flowering
[32:32.500 --> 32:36.980]  than some of the entries in our dual-purpose trials,
[32:36.980 --> 32:41.980]  and we will be harvesting it for grain later this month.
[32:43.180 --> 32:45.980]  The other new entry this year is Ginma,
[32:46.900 --> 32:50.300]  and it is a little bit later maturing
[32:50.300 --> 32:53.220]  than the Italian varieties we have in the trial
[32:53.220 --> 32:55.300]  as sort of our checks,
[32:55.300 --> 32:58.020]  and it's looking really good so far.
[32:59.660 --> 33:01.860]  Our grain trial has eight entries
[33:01.860 --> 33:04.660]  starting on the left with X59.
[33:04.660 --> 33:09.660]  There's CRS-1 in the middle and Canda on the right.
[33:11.300 --> 33:14.020]  In this photo, that's Canda again on the left
[33:14.020 --> 33:19.020]  followed by USO31 in the middle and Hanola on the right,
[33:20.780 --> 33:24.740]  and then finally, this photo has Piccolo on the left,
[33:24.740 --> 33:29.740]  Joey in the middle, and CFX2 on the right.
[33:31.860 --> 33:36.860]  Our dual-purpose trials has 15 entries this year.
[33:37.420 --> 33:41.900]  First there on the left, you can see NWG Elite
[33:41.900 --> 33:46.540]  followed by NWG Abound and Felina32.
[33:48.740 --> 33:53.740]  In the second slide, you see Fedora17, Vega, and then Anka.
[33:54.700 --> 34:02.580]  This slide is Futura75 on the left,
[34:02.980 --> 34:06.980]  Felicia in the middle, and Biajobradsky on the right.
[34:08.540 --> 34:14.410]  This slide contains the variety we're calling H51
[34:14.410 --> 34:17.490]  on the left, Hyliana in the center,
[34:17.490 --> 34:19.970]  and Rigel on the right.
[34:20.850 --> 34:23.890]  The final three entries in our dual-purpose trial
[34:23.890 --> 34:26.810]  are Altair on the left, Ferris,
[34:26.810 --> 34:29.890]  Ter on the left, Faramon in the middle,
[34:29.890 --> 34:31.890]  and Voico on the right.
[34:34.800 --> 34:37.560]  I'm so disappointed that we can't be together in person
[34:37.560 --> 34:40.200]  to show off our trials properly.
[34:40.200 --> 34:41.800]  When we've held field days in the past,
[34:41.800 --> 34:43.780]  I've noticed that people just cannot help
[34:43.780 --> 34:46.080]  but touch and smell the plants.
[34:46.080 --> 34:49.240]  I can't send the smells of the hemp field to you,
[34:49.240 --> 34:51.400]  but here is a video of one of our technicians
[34:51.400 --> 34:55.760]  petting the hemp plots for you to enjoy vicariously.
[34:55.760 --> 34:58.680]  And with that, I'll take any questions.
[35:01.860 --> 35:04.860]  Okay, thanks very much, Jamie.
[35:04.860 --> 35:07.640]  That was a great look at the beautiful trials
[35:07.640 --> 35:09.980]  we have this year in Ithaca.
[35:12.100 --> 35:15.840]  Unfortunately, our trials here in Geneva
[35:15.840 --> 35:17.140]  suffered from the drought.
[35:17.140 --> 35:22.140]  They don't look nearly as pretty as the ones in Ithaca.
[35:22.260 --> 35:26.900]  So we have now come to our first Q&A session.
[35:26.900 --> 35:30.820]  We're right on time, so we have 15 minutes for live Q&A.
[35:30.820 --> 35:34.780]  And I am going to, I would encourage the panelists
[35:34.780 --> 35:37.760]  to unmute their video, and I'm going to go through
[35:37.760 --> 35:41.140]  some of the excellent questions we got in the chat
[35:42.100 --> 35:45.940]  and start with George for this one.
[35:45.940 --> 35:49.180]  There's a very good question about how you define
[35:49.180 --> 35:53.620]  the start of flowering and what we mean
[35:54.220 --> 35:59.220]  by terminal flowering versus axillary flowering,
[35:59.580 --> 36:01.780]  if you could elaborate on that a little bit.
[36:02.700 --> 36:05.380]  Yeah, absolutely, that's a great question.
[36:05.380 --> 36:07.460]  So one of the things that's challenging
[36:07.460 --> 36:11.260]  about female flowering in hemp is that not all
[36:11.260 --> 36:13.620]  of the cultivars flower in the exact same way.
[36:13.620 --> 36:16.680]  So their floral morphology is different.
[36:17.680 --> 36:20.740]  So we define terminal flowering as a cluster
[36:20.740 --> 36:23.420]  of female flowers at the shoot tips.
[36:24.180 --> 36:26.220]  And we found that that was a pretty consistent way
[36:26.220 --> 36:30.740]  to mark all of the cultivars at the same physiological point.
[36:30.740 --> 36:35.100]  I will note that some cultivars do form axillary flowers,
[36:35.100 --> 36:38.500]  just one single small female flower in the axils
[36:38.500 --> 36:42.060]  of the leaves a lot earlier, but that is very variable
[36:42.060 --> 36:44.500]  and is not a great indicator of when the plants
[36:44.500 --> 36:46.180]  will start terminally flowering.
[36:49.160 --> 36:51.840]  Yeah, it can get tricky.
[36:51.880 --> 36:54.360]  Definitely you wanna get a loop
[36:54.360 --> 36:56.960]  or some other magnifying glass so you can look
[36:56.960 --> 37:00.840]  at the development of the trichomes as well.
[37:00.840 --> 37:04.120]  You want to see the development from clear trichomes
[37:04.120 --> 37:06.440]  to milky and then to amber.
[37:06.440 --> 37:11.240]  And those will be your cues as to the time of maturity
[37:11.240 --> 37:12.620]  and the time of harvest.
[37:13.680 --> 37:15.400]  Jacob, I'll point this one to you.
[37:15.400 --> 37:20.200]  There's a question about whether we are breeding cultivars
[37:20.200 --> 37:25.200]  that are high in varin cannabinoids or CBC as an example.
[37:30.720 --> 37:32.240]  Yes, I'll answer that question.
[37:32.240 --> 37:35.080]  So last year we tested several varieties
[37:35.080 --> 37:36.720]  and especially a few from China
[37:36.720 --> 37:39.400]  had quite high varin concentrations.
[37:39.400 --> 37:42.340]  But just like as I was talking about with Bama and Puma,
[37:42.340 --> 37:44.800]  they tended to mostly be THCV.
[37:44.800 --> 37:48.160]  They tended to be mostly type one and type two.
[37:48.160 --> 37:50.660]  We're actually currently growing a large population
[37:50.660 --> 37:53.160]  that we intend to screen with a molecular marker
[37:53.160 --> 37:55.060]  to pull out the type three plants.
[37:55.060 --> 37:57.600]  And we hope that those type three plants
[37:57.600 --> 38:00.840]  in that population that produces a lot of varins
[38:00.840 --> 38:03.080]  will produce a lot of CBDV.
[38:03.080 --> 38:07.040]  So in theory, if this works and you can get high varins,
[38:07.040 --> 38:09.640]  we may be able to develop a dual purpose
[38:09.640 --> 38:13.120]  CBDV grain or fiber cultivar.
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.480]  As for CBC, we're seeing some very interesting results,
[38:17.480 --> 38:20.840]  especially in some of these high CBD cultivars.
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.360]  We have one that produced up to 2% CBC.
[38:25.520 --> 38:27.280]  We're currently working to understand
[38:27.280 --> 38:30.120]  the basis of that production.
[38:30.120 --> 38:32.880]  But at the moment, we're not actively working
[38:32.880 --> 38:36.280]  to create any pure high CBC lines.
[38:37.820 --> 38:41.040]  And just to follow on, there are a couple more questions
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.560]  that I'll aim at you regarding CBG.
[38:45.560 --> 38:50.040]  So maybe you could briefly describe the genetic systems,
[38:50.040 --> 38:55.040]  George did touch on this, of how we get a high CBG line
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.280]  and what would happen if that CBG line were segregating,
[39:00.360 --> 39:05.360]  for example, were heterozygous for an active THCA synthase
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.700]  or was heterozygous for an active CBD synthase?
[39:12.580 --> 39:14.620]  Yeah, I can answer that question.
[39:14.620 --> 39:18.940]  So all cannabinoids start off as CBGA.
[39:18.940 --> 39:20.620]  So that's what it starts at.
[39:20.620 --> 39:24.820]  And then if there's an active CBDA or an active THCA,
[39:24.820 --> 39:29.820]  that enzyme converts the CBGA to THCA or CBDA.
[39:30.460 --> 39:32.580]  So in the absence of those enzymes,
[39:32.580 --> 39:35.500]  you get a CBGA dominant plant.
[39:35.500 --> 39:37.740]  Now, if you have a plant that's heterozygous
[39:37.740 --> 39:41.660]  for a CBDA synthase or a THCA synthase,
[39:42.500 --> 39:43.340]  that's something that we're looking at.
[39:43.340 --> 39:46.140]  We're not 100% sure what the result will be.
[39:46.140 --> 39:48.620]  It depends on the activity of this enzyme.
[39:48.620 --> 39:52.020]  If there's a lot of that enzyme in this heterozygous case,
[39:52.020 --> 39:55.340]  it's possible that we'll get the same conversion
[39:55.340 --> 39:58.980]  from CBGA to CBDA or THCA,
[39:58.980 --> 40:02.100]  but it's also possible that in the heterozygous case,
[40:02.100 --> 40:04.780]  the enzyme wouldn't be expressed at high enough levels
[40:04.780 --> 40:09.780]  to fully convert the CBGA to CBDA or THCA.
[40:10.220 --> 40:11.180]  And in that case,
[40:11.180 --> 40:13.820]  we would expect to see an intermediate value.
[40:13.820 --> 40:16.860]  We currently have a few F1s growing in the field
[40:16.860 --> 40:20.260]  between chemotype three and chemotype four,
[40:20.260 --> 40:23.420]  and we'll be testing those once they start to flower.
[40:23.420 --> 40:25.820]  But at the moment, we don't have any hard data.
[40:26.740 --> 40:29.140]  So there's probably going to be some variation.
[40:29.140 --> 40:32.020]  There is a significant amount of variation
[40:32.020 --> 40:35.780]  in CBDA synthase enzymes.
[40:35.780 --> 40:39.060]  We would expect some to be more active than others.
[40:39.060 --> 40:41.780]  So in short, it probably varies,
[40:41.780 --> 40:44.420]  and we're working to figure that out.
[40:44.420 --> 40:45.460]  Great, yeah.
[40:45.460 --> 40:49.020]  We should again qualify that much of the results
[40:49.020 --> 40:52.140]  that were presented today are mid-season results.
[40:52.140 --> 40:54.860]  We have not analyzed any of the cannabinoids
[40:54.860 --> 40:58.900]  from the 12 CBG lines that we have in trials.
[40:58.900 --> 41:00.940]  So stay tuned.
[41:00.940 --> 41:02.260]  I'm going to point to Jamie.
[41:02.260 --> 41:05.540]  There's an excellent question about pollination
[41:05.580 --> 41:10.580]  and how do we maintain these feminized CBD trials
[41:10.780 --> 41:14.780]  at the same time we're also doing grain and fiber trials.
[41:14.780 --> 41:17.300]  So Jamie, you touched on that in the chat box,
[41:17.300 --> 41:19.060]  but let's elaborate on that.
[41:22.290 --> 41:25.530]  Okay, so here in Ithaca,
[41:26.490 --> 41:31.210]  our terrain is very full of hills and gorges
[41:31.210 --> 41:35.850]  and very different landscapes that way.
[41:35.850 --> 41:39.050]  And so by mileage,
[41:39.050 --> 41:42.730]  we keep all of our trials at least one mile apart.
[41:42.730 --> 41:44.370]  But then in addition to that,
[41:44.370 --> 41:49.010]  they're definitely separated by lots of landscape features.
[41:49.010 --> 41:54.010]  So our CBD and essential oil trials are on an area
[41:54.010 --> 41:58.330]  that's pretty much surrounded by forested areas
[41:58.330 --> 42:00.930]  to sort of as an additional barrier
[42:00.930 --> 42:05.130]  to try and keep the pollen out of those areas.
[42:06.730 --> 42:09.610]  And there's another set of questions in there
[42:09.610 --> 42:11.850]  about irrigation.
[42:12.690 --> 42:14.810]  So did we irrigate through the drought
[42:14.810 --> 42:18.690]  and how was fertilization done?
[42:18.690 --> 42:20.690]  So this is one of the major differences
[42:20.690 --> 42:24.810]  between our current CBD cultivation practices,
[42:24.810 --> 42:28.530]  which are based on plastic culture and drip irrigation
[42:28.530 --> 42:33.090]  versus the broad acre grain and fiber cultivation.
[42:33.090 --> 42:35.610]  So you want to talk about that a little bit, Jamie?
[42:36.290 --> 42:41.290]  Sure, so none of our fiber and grain trials were irrigated.
[42:42.690 --> 42:47.650]  We did our very best guess on when to plant
[42:47.650 --> 42:51.610]  based on the weather forecast and what we could see,
[42:51.610 --> 42:53.530]  but we did not,
[42:54.410 --> 42:57.530]  because they have to be separated by so far,
[42:57.530 --> 42:58.930]  by such a great distance,
[42:59.890 --> 43:02.050]  a lot of the areas where we would plant
[43:02.050 --> 43:04.610]  our grain and fiber trials are not necessarily in spots
[43:04.610 --> 43:07.290]  where we even could irrigate if we wanted to.
[43:08.650 --> 43:11.290]  So the grain trials are all,
[43:11.290 --> 43:15.690]  the fields are fertilized before we plant with,
[43:16.810 --> 43:20.730]  I believe this year we used 2299, it was our fertilizer.
[43:20.730 --> 43:23.810]  So it was broadcast on the fields
[43:23.810 --> 43:27.770]  at a rate about 75 pounds of nitrogen per acre.
[43:28.810 --> 43:33.810]  And then at about a month into the planting,
[43:33.930 --> 43:35.970]  the fiber trials and the grain trials
[43:35.970 --> 43:40.530]  were given an additional 70 pounds of nitrogen per acre
[43:40.530 --> 43:42.090]  as ammonium sulfate.
[43:43.650 --> 43:48.010]  The CBD trials, I mean, Craig is there.
[43:48.010 --> 43:49.970]  He could probably talk more about those.
[43:49.970 --> 43:52.930]  Those were all through the drip irrigation.
[43:54.650 --> 43:58.610]  Yep, so we've been injecting a water-soluble fertilizer.
[43:58.610 --> 44:02.330]  We did include a granular fertilizer
[44:02.330 --> 44:04.610]  as we laid the beds
[44:05.770 --> 44:08.810]  at about 90 pounds of nitrogen to the acre.
[44:08.810 --> 44:10.730]  And then we have supplemented that
[44:10.730 --> 44:15.730]  with soluble 12, 5, 16 fertilizer through the drip line.
[44:17.690 --> 44:20.730]  We've done that twice in our CBD trials.
[44:20.730 --> 44:25.290]  At this point, most of those CBD plants are in flower
[44:25.290 --> 44:27.410]  or very close to flower.
[44:27.410 --> 44:30.850]  So we will not add any additional fertilizer at this point,
[44:31.730 --> 44:34.530]  although there's a lot of research that needs to be done
[44:34.530 --> 44:37.570]  to clarify a best practice here,
[44:37.570 --> 44:39.250]  an optimum management practice.
[44:39.250 --> 44:43.490]  But our plants are quite large right now
[44:43.490 --> 44:47.530]  and encouraging additional vegetative growth
[44:47.530 --> 44:50.690]  may not be beneficial overall at this point.
[44:50.690 --> 44:52.890]  So many other good questions in here
[44:52.890 --> 44:55.050]  and we're gonna do our best to answer them.
[44:56.330 --> 45:00.050]  If we can't answer them in this Q&A session,
[45:00.050 --> 45:02.330]  by all means, follow up with us afterwards
[45:02.330 --> 45:04.010]  or follow up with your local
[45:04.010 --> 45:06.090]  Cornell Cooperative Extension specialist.
[45:07.250 --> 45:09.850]  There's a question about why sending
[45:09.850 --> 45:12.810]  the Chinese fiber plants to Florida?
[45:13.770 --> 45:16.370]  Was there not supplemental lighting in the greenhouse?
[45:16.370 --> 45:17.930]  What's going on here?
[45:17.930 --> 45:20.330]  Jacob, do you wanna answer that question
[45:20.330 --> 45:25.170]  about critical day length of these Chinese varieties
[45:25.170 --> 45:27.970]  versus other grain and fiber types, for example?
[45:28.850 --> 45:32.370]  So there's a lot that we don't know about these plants.
[45:32.370 --> 45:34.890]  We've run some GBS on them
[45:34.890 --> 45:37.610]  and Craig has some interesting data about them
[45:37.610 --> 45:41.890]  and they tend to be quite genetically distinct
[45:41.890 --> 45:43.450]  and quite genetically distinct,
[45:43.450 --> 45:46.610]  especially from other grain and fiber types.
[45:47.770 --> 45:49.450]  So what we think is going on
[45:49.450 --> 45:52.850]  is that it requires a very short day length.
[45:52.850 --> 45:55.650]  We don't know what that critical photo period is.
[45:55.650 --> 45:58.210]  For a lot of our full season CBD varieties,
[45:58.210 --> 46:01.530]  once the day length gets below about 14 hours,
[46:01.530 --> 46:03.210]  we start seeing flowering.
[46:03.210 --> 46:05.450]  For these plants, it might be considerably lower.
[46:05.450 --> 46:08.170]  It might be 13 hours, we don't know.
[46:09.170 --> 46:12.930]  But in Florida, which is a lot closer to the equator,
[46:12.930 --> 46:16.130]  we're expecting the day length to be shorter.
[46:17.210 --> 46:19.330]  And in Florida, the yeast collaborator
[46:19.330 --> 46:21.610]  has also been testing these lines
[46:21.610 --> 46:24.570]  and they flowered late in Florida,
[46:24.570 --> 46:27.410]  but they flowered and they were able to harvest seed.
[46:27.410 --> 46:31.610]  In our trials, we didn't push it to the last possible second
[46:31.610 --> 46:36.210]  but we were not able to harvest seed from these varieties.
[46:36.210 --> 46:41.210]  And we think it's due to a very short photo period
[46:42.050 --> 46:44.010]  requirement for these plants to flower.
[46:45.170 --> 46:47.970]  So in the greenhouse,
[46:48.970 --> 46:51.850]  the plants were mature around March or so.
[46:51.850 --> 46:53.170]  And at that point,
[46:54.290 --> 46:57.170]  some of the plants were just starting to flower,
[46:57.170 --> 46:59.490]  but we don't have a shade curtain
[46:59.490 --> 47:01.570]  and the day lengths are starting to get too long
[47:01.570 --> 47:02.850]  at that point.
[47:02.850 --> 47:04.770]  And then the plants that were starting to flower
[47:04.770 --> 47:07.650]  ceased flowering, went back to vegetative.
[47:07.650 --> 47:10.370]  So ultimately, if we had a shade curtain
[47:10.370 --> 47:12.570]  and could block out the sun,
[47:12.570 --> 47:14.330]  we might've been able to get them to flower,
[47:14.330 --> 47:16.330]  but we don't have that facility yet.
[47:17.330 --> 47:21.330]  Yep, so the problem was actually not supplemental lighting,
[47:21.330 --> 47:26.330]  but our lack of ability to deprive the plants,
[47:27.530 --> 47:31.010]  to shade the plants and keep them dark.
[47:31.010 --> 47:32.690]  So we're very much looking forward
[47:32.690 --> 47:35.210]  to having that light deprivation shading
[47:35.210 --> 47:39.250]  so that we can control flowering all 12 months of the year,
[47:39.250 --> 47:42.010]  even when the days get too long,
[47:42.010 --> 47:43.770]  which is in March and April.
[47:44.050 --> 47:45.130]  Some other questions,
[47:45.130 --> 47:46.730]  there's a good question from Paul
[47:46.730 --> 47:48.930]  about whether molecular breeding can be used
[47:48.930 --> 47:51.490]  for pest and disease resistance.
[47:51.490 --> 47:55.490]  That is a great lead in to our next talks
[47:56.330 --> 47:58.170]  in the next session,
[47:58.170 --> 47:59.690]  starting at 10 o'clock,
[48:01.090 --> 48:04.850]  where Chris and Allie will talk about some of our work
[48:04.850 --> 48:06.970]  on powdery mildew resistance.
[48:06.970 --> 48:11.410]  So yes, we are confident that we will be able
[48:12.050 --> 48:13.650]  to develop molecular markers
[48:13.650 --> 48:16.890]  for at least for some disease resistance.
[48:20.850 --> 48:21.690]  Other questions,
[48:21.690 --> 48:24.250]  there are questions about recommendations
[48:24.250 --> 48:28.010]  for the best cultivars for dual purpose.
[48:28.010 --> 48:30.850]  And let me also get back to a question
[48:30.850 --> 48:35.850]  about a dual purpose fiber and CBD cultivars.
[48:36.010 --> 48:38.850]  So we have posted our,
[48:39.290 --> 48:43.130]  we have posted our grain and fiber trial results
[48:43.130 --> 48:43.970]  on our website.
[48:43.970 --> 48:45.810]  So please look those over.
[48:45.810 --> 48:48.450]  I will say there is variability
[48:48.450 --> 48:51.610]  in the quality of seed lots from year to year.
[48:51.610 --> 48:55.330]  Still, that is still a major issue in the industry
[48:55.330 --> 48:59.490]  is the ability to get reliably high quality seed
[48:59.490 --> 49:00.650]  from year to year.
[49:01.690 --> 49:05.690]  Finding a local seed source helps with that.
[49:05.690 --> 49:10.690]  So we have had very good relationship with Uniseeds
[49:11.050 --> 49:13.490]  just across the border in Ontario
[49:13.490 --> 49:15.530]  in providing us high quality seed.
[49:16.650 --> 49:19.530]  But please look over those results
[49:21.210 --> 49:24.210]  and recognize that they are still only
[49:24.210 --> 49:26.850]  on a relatively small number of sites
[49:26.850 --> 49:29.690]  and soil types in New York State.
[49:29.690 --> 49:32.490]  I'll just say in general that hemp demands
[49:32.490 --> 49:36.490]  the highest quality soils you have in your farm.
[49:36.490 --> 49:41.370]  It requires a deep rich loam that is well drained.
[49:41.370 --> 49:42.890]  So don't believe the hype
[49:42.890 --> 49:45.850]  that hemp can grow on marginal soils,
[49:45.850 --> 49:50.450]  or as one of my good friends and colleagues said,
[49:50.450 --> 49:52.290]  you can grow it on marginal soil
[49:52.290 --> 49:54.050]  and you'll get marginal yield.
[49:56.090 --> 50:01.090]  So it's a good question about producing CBD and fiber.
[50:01.450 --> 50:05.450]  So the CBD is produced in the female flowers
[50:05.450 --> 50:10.450]  and to get the optimum fiber, high quality long fiber,
[50:11.250 --> 50:13.290]  you need to harvest relatively early
[50:13.290 --> 50:14.890]  right at the start of flowering.
[50:15.770 --> 50:20.210]  But there may well be enough CBD produced in those flowers
[50:20.210 --> 50:22.610]  at that point in the development
[50:22.610 --> 50:25.610]  that you can get a reasonable yield of CBD
[50:25.610 --> 50:28.890]  as well as your yield of high quality fiber.
[50:28.930 --> 50:33.170]  And Hempflex has produced a harvester
[50:33.170 --> 50:36.490]  that has a flower harvesting combine head
[50:36.490 --> 50:40.410]  that can rise quite high and chop those flower heads,
[50:40.410 --> 50:43.690]  and at the same time be chopping the fiber.
[50:43.690 --> 50:48.690]  So we look forward to the industry continuing to expand
[50:49.370 --> 50:51.130]  and develop that machinery
[50:51.130 --> 50:56.010]  so that we can potentially do a dual purpose CBD
[50:56.010 --> 50:57.650]  and fiber harvest.
[50:57.650 --> 51:00.090]  And I'll just answer one more question in here
[51:00.090 --> 51:01.370]  that I noticed.
[51:01.370 --> 51:06.370]  What about going to a broad acre cultivation for CBD?
[51:06.850 --> 51:09.970]  That's definitely a trend that we're seeing in the industry.
[51:09.970 --> 51:14.290]  We're seeing in Colorado, center pivot irrigation
[51:14.290 --> 51:18.130]  and broad acre planting for CBD.
[51:18.130 --> 51:22.570]  We actually have two trials planted this year,
[51:22.570 --> 51:26.650]  direct seeded CBD trials, one at very high density,
[51:27.530 --> 51:29.850]  similar to our grain and fiber trials,
[51:29.850 --> 51:33.010]  and the other a little bit lower planted on 30 inch spacing
[51:33.890 --> 51:38.450]  that we thin down to 12 or 18 inches between plants.
[51:38.450 --> 51:43.330]  So we have a flower combine header on order.
[51:43.330 --> 51:45.490]  It should come in in a couple of weeks.
[51:45.490 --> 51:49.610]  And that's what we look forward to researching next year.
[51:49.610 --> 51:52.690]  The end of this year and next year is focusing more
[51:52.690 --> 51:57.330]  on broad acre plantings and combine harvesting
[51:57.330 --> 51:59.130]  of flower heads for CBD.
[52:00.250 --> 52:02.610]  So I'm going to pause right here
[52:02.610 --> 52:04.690]  and we have a five minute break.
[52:05.690 --> 52:09.330]  So continue to ask your questions in the chat box
[52:09.330 --> 52:11.410]  so the panelists can respond to that.
[52:12.450 --> 52:15.450]  And we will be back and start our program again
[52:15.450 --> 52:16.570]  at 10 o'clock.
[52:17.450 --> 52:18.410]  Thank you everyone.
[52:22.760 --> 52:24.960]  Okay, welcome back everyone.
[52:25.480 --> 52:29.400]  It's 10 o'clock and we're going to resume our program.
[52:30.800 --> 52:34.240]  Next on our program, well, we're starting our second session
[52:34.240 --> 52:39.040]  on hemp crop management with some of our pathologists
[52:39.040 --> 52:42.120]  and entomologists and weed scientists in this group,
[52:42.120 --> 52:44.440]  starting with a live presentation
[52:44.440 --> 52:48.440]  from graduate student, Ali Kalla in the field
[52:48.440 --> 52:49.960]  with Chris Smart.
[52:49.960 --> 52:51.840]  So Chris, you're muted.
[52:51.840 --> 52:53.360]  You can go ahead and unmute
[52:54.240 --> 52:56.280]  and we will start the presentation.
[52:57.680 --> 52:58.520]  Okay, hi.
[52:59.640 --> 53:02.360]  Like Larry said, my name's Ali Kalla.
[53:02.360 --> 53:05.040]  I'm a graduate student in Chris Smart's lab
[53:05.040 --> 53:07.280]  who is out here with me.
[53:07.280 --> 53:09.560]  Of course, we're staying six feet apart.
[53:09.560 --> 53:13.800]  And also out here is another lab member of ours, Colin Day.
[53:14.880 --> 53:18.600]  So sorry in advance if we disconnect,
[53:18.600 --> 53:20.760]  we're going to do our best.
[53:20.760 --> 53:23.040]  But I just wanted to talk a little bit
[53:23.040 --> 53:24.720]  about some of my research.
[53:24.720 --> 53:29.720]  So I'm looking mostly at a pathogen called powdery mildew,
[53:29.800 --> 53:33.320]  which we have out here in the field
[53:33.320 --> 53:34.640]  that we wanted to show you.
[53:34.640 --> 53:38.600]  And we're working with Larry's lab to do some,
[53:40.560 --> 53:42.840]  looking for resistance for powdery mildew.
[53:42.840 --> 53:44.360]  But I wanted to talk a little bit
[53:44.360 --> 53:46.440]  about a different project today
[53:46.440 --> 53:50.560]  about how powdery mildew can affect secondary metabolites
[53:51.360 --> 53:52.400]  in hemp.
[53:52.400 --> 53:57.080]  So we all know about some secondary metabolites
[53:57.080 --> 54:02.080]  like cannabinoids, which include CBD and CPG.
[54:02.120 --> 54:04.680]  But there's another class of secondary metabolites
[54:04.680 --> 54:08.920]  that hemp produces a lot of, which are terpenes.
[54:08.920 --> 54:13.080]  And terpenes are volatile compounds
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.640]  that are also produced by the flower
[54:15.640 --> 54:19.640]  and are responsible for the fragrance
[54:19.640 --> 54:23.560]  and flavor of the hemp flowers.
[54:23.560 --> 54:28.560]  So we have three major questions
[54:29.520 --> 54:32.920]  that we're trying to address with this project.
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.920]  The first being, how do the terpene profiles
[54:38.320 --> 54:41.520]  in hemp change throughout the season
[54:41.520 --> 54:46.320]  and how does flowering time affect those terpene profiles?
[54:46.320 --> 54:48.080]  And so for that project,
[54:48.080 --> 54:51.480]  we are collecting terpene samples weekly
[54:51.480 --> 54:54.040]  throughout the season from the same plants.
[54:55.760 --> 54:57.640]  And so our second question is,
[54:57.640 --> 55:02.640]  how does a biological fungicide affect the terpene profiles?
[55:05.760 --> 55:10.760]  And for that project, we have been treating some plants
[55:11.120 --> 55:15.280]  with a bacillus-based biological fungicide
[55:16.280 --> 55:18.160]  according to the label rate.
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.160]  And we've taken samples from plants that were treated
[55:24.080 --> 55:25.800]  and plants that were untreated.
[55:25.800 --> 55:29.840]  And I recently inoculated those plants with powdery mildew.
[55:29.840 --> 55:32.240]  And once an infection is established,
[55:32.240 --> 55:35.280]  we'll take another collection from those plants
[55:35.280 --> 55:38.760]  and we'll be able to see how those compare.
[55:38.800 --> 55:41.880]  And then the third question is more relating
[55:41.880 --> 55:44.680]  to the pathogens themselves
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.240]  and how the pathogens can affect terpene profiles
[55:49.240 --> 55:51.160]  as well as cannabinoid profiles.
[55:52.160 --> 55:54.800]  And for that one, we're adding in a second pathogen,
[55:54.800 --> 55:56.040]  Botrytis gray mold.
[55:56.040 --> 56:00.480]  So we'll have plants inoculated with powdery mildew,
[56:00.480 --> 56:03.560]  plants inoculated with Botrytis and healthy plants.
[56:03.560 --> 56:05.400]  And we'll take terpene samples
[56:05.400 --> 56:08.800]  from all three of those types of plants
[56:08.800 --> 56:11.280]  and see how the terpene levels differ.
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.000]  And for that project as well, at the end of the season,
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.360]  we will also take flower samples
[56:20.360 --> 56:23.720]  so that we can look at cannabinoid profiles as well.
[56:23.720 --> 56:26.280]  So for collecting terpenes,
[56:26.280 --> 56:28.920]  it's a little bit more challenging
[56:28.920 --> 56:30.520]  and we have to get a little bit more creative
[56:30.520 --> 56:33.000]  since those compounds are volatiles.
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.040]  So we have kind of an interesting setup for our collections
[56:37.040 --> 56:39.840]  that we kind of wanted to talk about and show you today.
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.720]  So we have our setup here and we use these turkey bags.
[56:47.080 --> 56:48.800]  They're just these plastic bags
[56:48.800 --> 56:51.960]  that people use to cook turkeys in.
[56:51.960 --> 56:54.600]  So I actually have to bake these
[56:54.600 --> 56:58.760]  so that we don't have to have any interference
[56:58.760 --> 57:01.760]  with chemicals from the bags and what we're collecting.
[57:01.760 --> 57:05.720]  And we take these bags and we just secure them
[57:05.720 --> 57:07.840]  around a part of the plant that we wanna collect,
[57:07.840 --> 57:10.400]  usually a part that has flowers.
[57:10.400 --> 57:12.840]  We secure it at the base with zip ties
[57:12.840 --> 57:16.080]  to make it nice and secure.
[57:16.080 --> 57:20.160]  And then from there, we cut two holes in the bag,
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.400]  one so we have airflow in and one so we have airflow out.
[57:24.400 --> 57:27.280]  For the hole that is the airflow in,
[57:27.280 --> 57:31.440]  we secure a filter so that the air coming in
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.240]  isn't going to contaminate our sample.
[57:34.240 --> 57:35.880]  And then for the airflow out,
[57:37.840 --> 57:40.280]  it's connected to some tubing,
[57:40.280 --> 57:45.280]  which is then connected to a collection tube,
[57:45.320 --> 57:49.200]  which has a filter inside that the compounds can stick to.
[57:50.280 --> 57:53.600]  Then the collection tube is connected to a pump,
[57:53.600 --> 57:55.280]  which provides the airflow.
[57:56.200 --> 57:59.800]  And all of this equipment is provided to us
[57:59.800 --> 58:01.720]  by Dennis Willits Lab,
[58:01.720 --> 58:04.520]  who we're collaborating with on this project.
[58:04.520 --> 58:09.520]  And once we have our collection on this tube,
[58:09.640 --> 58:14.640]  it goes directly onto a machine called a gas spectrometer
[58:14.640 --> 58:16.640]  and mass spectrometer.
[58:23.720 --> 58:26.240]  And that machine can allow us to see
[58:26.240 --> 58:29.160]  what compounds are there and at what levels they're there.
[58:29.520 --> 58:34.520]  And so we can determine a secondary metabolite profile
[58:34.680 --> 58:36.280]  for all of our samples.
[58:36.280 --> 58:41.280]  And the GC-MS is also provided by the Dennis Willits Lab,
[58:42.440 --> 58:46.040]  who is working with us on this project.
[58:46.040 --> 58:49.320]  And they're kindly letting us use all of this equipment.
[58:50.960 --> 58:55.960]  So that is what I've got for my secondary metabolite project.
[58:56.280 --> 58:57.120]  Oh, yes.
[58:57.120 --> 59:01.120]  And we have some more pottery on this plant.
[59:01.120 --> 59:04.360]  That's part of the reason we're out in this trial.
[59:04.360 --> 59:07.480]  We have some nice examples of pottery out here.
[59:10.280 --> 59:14.320]  So I'm looking forward to answering any questions
[59:14.320 --> 59:16.360]  later during the Q&A session.
[59:17.880 --> 59:18.720]  Back to Larry.
[59:20.360 --> 59:22.000]  Okay, great.
[59:22.000 --> 59:23.040]  Thanks very much.
[59:23.160 --> 59:25.200]  Okay, great.
[59:25.200 --> 59:26.600]  Thanks very much.
[59:26.600 --> 59:27.520]  That worked great.
[59:28.920 --> 59:33.920]  And folks can definitely see that we have our share
[59:34.960 --> 59:37.840]  of powdery mildew in our trials.
[59:38.840 --> 59:42.240]  And I'm going to shift now to start the presentation
[59:42.240 --> 59:45.760]  from Jen Starr in Gary Bergstrom's lab.
[59:45.760 --> 59:49.200]  And she will give you some excellent descriptions
[59:49.240 --> 59:54.240]  of other diseases we have had in hemp.
[59:55.520 --> 59:58.000]  Hello and welcome to the 2020 Virtual Cornell
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.840]  Hemp Research Team Field Day.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.160]  My name is Jennifer Starr,
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.360]  and I am the research support specialist
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.680]  for Dr. Gary Bergstrom's Field Crops Pathology Laboratory.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.800]  I also work alongside Kevin Myers,
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.800]  who helps with scouting for hemp disease
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.680]  and does our molecular testing.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.360]  Today, I'll be giving a brief overview
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.440]  of foliar diseases and possible management strategies.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.680]  I want to focus this talk on just a few things.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.000]  To highlight, I will start with septoria leaf spot
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.680]  and bipolaris leaf spot, also known as hemp leaf spot.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.080]  Then I will move to lesser impact emerging leaf diseases,
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.600]  such as downy mildew and hemp rust.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.160]  Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septorius species
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.200]  and symptoms begin on the lower leaves of the plant
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.320]  as irregularly shaped spots with yellow margins.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.200]  These spots expand over time, turn brown,
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.480]  and the yellow margins broaden to look something like this.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.760]  This was observed in Eastern New York in 2019
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.440]  and in Eastern and Western New York in 2020.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.800]  In this slide, I have a video
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.480]  of what septoria leaf spot looks like in the field.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.640]  And as you can see, it is on the lower leaves,
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.280]  brown spots with the bigger yellow margins.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.320]  This is septoria leaf spot.
[01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:42.170]  The next highlight is bipolaris leaf spot,
[01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:44.170]  also known as hemp leaf spot.
[01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.250]  This is caused by a fungus that's being classified
[01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:53.250]  as bipolaris gigantea, related to Dreshlera gigantea.
[01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:57.050]  Symptoms start as round specks and spots
[01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:58.970]  that coalesce over time.
[01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:02.730]  And sometimes they have a dark margin here
[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.730]  with lighter tan interiors,
[01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:08.450]  or sometimes don't have any margin at all.
[01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:10.890]  We have noticed this leaf spot disease
[01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:14.730]  since Cornell's hemp team started the program
[01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.010]  a few years back.
[01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:19.530]  And we usually notice this at the end of the growing season.
[01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:22.490]  And we've noticed this throughout New York state.
[01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:26.410]  This is not a super high impact disease
[01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.810]  as other states have seen it defoliate plants.
[01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:32.570]  We have not seen that yet in New York state.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.040]  Next up, we have downy mildew,
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.560]  lesser impact emerging disease.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.920]  This is caused by Pseudopronospera canabina,
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.920]  which has just been recently ID by sequencing last week.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.240]  The spots start out as these light green yellow spots
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.160]  with necrotic margins.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.080]  And the lower surface of the leaf,
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.880]  you can actually see the fungus growing in humid conditions,
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.160]  or if you catch it in the morning time
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.320]  when the dew is still on the plant.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.160]  Later on, the lesions become a little more angular
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:19.840]  and are defined by the leaf veins of the hemp plant.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.480]  This was just recently observed in Ithaca last week,
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.960]  so in 2020.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.760]  And in the next slide,
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.360]  I have a video of what it looks like on the plant.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.180]  And this is a good example of how
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.380]  the veins of the leaf are demarcating the spot
[01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:50.290]  and confining it, as you see here.
[01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.530]  This is downy mildew on hemp.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.960]  Our last feature is hemp rust.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.240]  And hemp rust has been morphologically identified
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.440]  as Eurydocregariana.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.520]  And again, this is something we're gonna wanna be looking
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.760]  on the lower surface of the leaf.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.000]  We have yellow to orange pustules
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.040]  or spots on the lower surface.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.240]  And on the upper surface,
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.280]  we have these necrotic areas
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.080]  with very faint chlorosis around them.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.040]  And then sometimes, rust disease systems
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.160]  have alternate hosts to complete their life cycle.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.040]  We have not found an alternate host with this hemp rust.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.840]  Sometimes, rust disease systems don't have alternate hosts.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.960]  We found this last year at the end of the growing season
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.240]  in October of 2019.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.480]  We will be looking again this year for this
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.840]  so we can try to study it further.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.720]  The following slide is a closeup
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.240]  of what the pustule looks like
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.840]  on the undersurface of the leaf
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.960]  and what is inside that pustule.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.880]  These are Eurydeneospores of hemp rust.
[01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:09.350]  We do see other hemp leaf spots.
[01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:14.350]  I wanted to include a quick summary of those here.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.800]  We see Christiolariella, zone eight leaf spot.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.400]  We see Cercospora leaf spot.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.120]  We see some psyllium leaf spots.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.560]  And we also see a number of other diseases
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.240]  that are not leaf spots.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.920]  We see Fusarium bud blight,
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.240]  which could have implications
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.240]  for a quality of flowers and grain.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.520]  We see Fusarium wilt.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.360]  We see white mold.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.440]  And we see Botrytis gray mold.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.560]  So as you can see, in addition to leaf spot diseases,
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.000]  we do see and work on other diseases
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.520]  that are affecting hemp.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.400]  So possible product treatments,
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.880]  we are directing growers to go to the DEC,
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.040]  New York DEC webpage at this address
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.720]  and go to pesticide product information, hit search.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.360]  This will bring you to advanced search.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.720]  You want to click that, press search,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.360]  which will then bring you to pesticide use.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.120]  You want to choose hemp industrial.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.480]  Hit search.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.640]  That will bring up about 98 products,
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.280]  most of which are biologic in nature,
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.440]  some bacillus type products.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.160]  You want to check the labels on those
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.560]  to make sure hemp is included.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.840]  All of this information again is present
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.200]  on the Cornell hemp webpage under the FAQ heading.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.280]  In addition to the DEC webpage,
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.160]  we want to use best agronomic practices.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.080]  This will be second nature to seasoned growers
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.840]  and producers, but we want to start with prevention,
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.560]  with having reliable seed source and good soil health.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.360]  It is a myth that hemp can be produced on marginal soils.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.240]  We want fertile soil, well-drained soil.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.600]  We want our plant spacing to be such
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.120]  where we're reducing the humidity between the plants
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:19.000]  because fungus really loves to be in humid places.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.280]  It encourages its growth.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.920]  Sanitation, very important.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.920]  We want to remove debris offsite.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.600]  You may burn it, you may compost it,
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.240]  but we want it away from the hemp field.
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.320]  Weed control, also very important.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.560]  We have noticed Cercospora growing on weeds.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.040]  We have noticed Downy Mildew growing on weeds.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  Are those weeds vectors for fungal growth to the hemp
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.080]  or is it the other way around?
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.600]  We are still investigating that,
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.840]  but it's important to keep those weeds in control
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.080]  and out of the way.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.480]  Crop rotation, also something to note.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.600]  Edible beans, soybeans, sunflowers in their white molds,
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:03.880]  probably not a great idea to follow hemp after those crops.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.960]  Also in question recently, corn and cereal crops
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.560]  producing mycotoxins will be wise
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.240]  to put hemp after those crops.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.600]  And then resistant cultivars,
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.720]  something that our program here at Cornell
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.280]  are working towards now.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.120]  If you have questions about your hemp crop
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.640]  and have problems and want some diagnostics,
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.560]  it may be wise for you to contact
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.320]  your Cornell Cooperative Extension educator.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.000]  If you don't know who yours is,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.960]  you may go to the Cornell hemp page
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.840]  and find who your representative is.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.920]  If you would like to submit samples to my lab,
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.560]  you may submit them through your
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.560]  Cornell Cooperative Extension educator,
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.400]  through them to us.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.000]  We may not give you the best turnaround time,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.240]  but it will be of no charge to you.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.480]  Or if you're looking for some quick results,
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.920]  you can use our plant disease diagnostic clinic at Cornell.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.840]  And it is a fee for service.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.480]  It's relatively low cost.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.200]  I believe it's 30 to $35.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.800]  If you're in state, $50.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:17.800]  If you're out of state,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:21.800]  and I've left the contact information for you here.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.480]  Again, all of this information
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.000]  is on the Cornell team webpage.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.560]  I'm going to leave you with our lab's contact information.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.680]  This is Dr. Gary Bergstrom's email address.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.320]  This is my email address and our laboratory phone number.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.080]  If you have further questions after this talk today.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.080]  Thanks for your time.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.440]  And I hope you enjoy the rest of Cornell's
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.480]  virtual hemp talks today.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.800]  Thanks very much, Jen.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.000]  We're a little bit ahead of schedule now.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.200]  We have a couple of minutes for questions.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.360]  So I do see a couple of questions in the chat box.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.160]  If Jen or Gary are available
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.080]  and want to follow up on those questions.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.080]  One is, are any of these products OMRI listed?
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:19.340]  I'll just jump in, this is Gary.
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.260]  There are quite a few things listed
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.380]  with fungicidal or insecticidal activity on the OMRI list.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.020]  And a lot of those are on the DEC list.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.820]  The term suggested is problematic
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:36.340]  because there's very little test data
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.220]  supporting efficacy at this point.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:42.380]  And I know that Chris and her lab is looking at that
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.700]  in the context of mildew and whatnot.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.260]  We've done some fairly rudimentary testing
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.140]  for some of the late season things,
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.500]  but really there's not a database there to point to.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.500]  So we have counseled growers to look at a few materials
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:04.340]  that have efficacy in other crop areas.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.420]  So we have some insights that they might work
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.260]  and to try to do some treated strips
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.700]  and leave some non-treated to try to learn something here.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:16.420]  But recommendations are a bit elusive,
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:18.500]  at least for us in New York at this point.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.920]  There's another question specifically
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:27.920]  about bacillus fungicides, CEAS or serenade.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.360]  I don't know if Chris has included those in her trial.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:37.360]  I see Chris is on, but again, the trial is underway.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.840]  We don't have results at this point, as Gary mentioned.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.080]  It's definitely an active area of research.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.680]  Jan and Gary, one more question
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.560]  before we move on to Marion's presentation from Nicole.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.480]  Do you see any cultivar differences
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.920]  in susceptibility to leaf spots?
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.040]  Great question, Nicole.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.800]  And I know you're interested in this as well.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.120]  And the answer is hopefully yes.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.760]  Whether they're repeatable differences,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.360]  that's what we wanna know.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.880]  We have particular opportunity
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.760]  in the cultivar trials out this year
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:19.760]  to try to discriminate varieties in the cultivars
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.960]  in the sense of downy mildew for sure.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.960]  And also I think with the Bipolaris hemp leaf spot as well.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.800]  But yeah, that's a goal and we're not there yet.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.720]  Perhaps in Kentucky, you got a better read on some of that.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.560]  Thanks.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.800]  Thanks very much, Gary and Jan.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.280]  Great presentation.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.800]  We are going to move on.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.880]  I'm gonna start Marion Zufla's presentation
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.680]  from New York State IPM.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.280]  I will just give you a heads up.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.200]  The audio levels on this video are pretty low.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.640]  So you may need to turn up your volume a bit
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.120]  once it gets started here.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.720]  Good morning.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.560]  My name is Marion Zufla
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.120]  and I work for the New York State
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.400]  Integrated Pest Management Program.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.160]  Today I'm gonna talk to you about insect pests
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.600]  or potential insect pests of hemp and their management.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.360]  This was my first summer working in hemp
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.320]  and I've really enjoyed the experience.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.520]  So my goal this summer was to just go out there
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.240]  and learn as much as I can about hemp,
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.720]  try to identify any insects and diseases that are out there.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.480]  So today I'm gonna specifically just talk
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.440]  about the insect pests.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.280]  We've already heard about some of the diseases out there.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.040]  And so I'm just gonna focus in on what insects I found.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.360]  Before I get started,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.360]  I first just wanted to stress the importance
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.200]  of scouting and identification
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.720]  because not everything that's out there is a pest.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.320]  In fact, very few insects today
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.840]  have caused enough damage to impact hemp.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:51.200]  And this crop is still relatively new.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.800]  So we don't have a lot of thresholds
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.360]  for any insect pests that we do find.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.640]  So for this reason, it's very important for you to go out,
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.680]  scout your hemp fields regularly
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.160]  and that way you can notice any potential problems
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.520]  and keep an eye on them.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.760]  So what I did this summer was I scouted
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.600]  nine different hemp fields weekly,
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.080]  as well as one high tunnel.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.840]  And I also set up a European corn borer tracks,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.520]  which you can see here in the picture next to hemp field
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.000]  so I can monitor the flight of European corn borer,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.800]  which is one of the known pests, potential pests of hemp.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.000]  Again, not everything is a pest.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.520]  So we have to be able to identify what's a pest,
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.560]  what's a beneficial and what's an incidental,
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.040]  an insect that just happens to be out in the field,
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.520]  but isn't causing any damage.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.320]  Okay, so now I'm gonna go over some of the insects
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.200]  that I did find this season.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.160]  The first one that I encountered was early in the season,
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.440]  while the plants were still in the greenhouse,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.200]  the grower came to me and he informed me
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.040]  that hundreds of the seedlings were dying.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.320]  And you can see that from the top upper right-hand corner,
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.440]  the seedlings were turning yellow and were dying
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.440]  and he wasn't quite sure what was causing it.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.320]  And we noticed that he had a lot of fungus gnats
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.640]  and he also had fusarium.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.000]  And we determined that it was fusarium.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.320]  We took some seedlings and sent them to Chris Smart
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.720]  and she identified fusarium in the seedlings.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.920]  So the fungus gnats, they are tiny little flies
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.240]  that lay their eggs in wet soil
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.760]  near the base of the plants.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.640]  The larvae will hatch out of the eggs
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.520]  and then they start feeding on decaying matter,
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.600]  but they will also feed on roots.
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.480]  And both the adult fungus gnats,
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.480]  as well as the larvae can transmit diseases
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.000]  such as fusarium.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.760]  So what the grower did is he changed out his potting media
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.680]  and then he also decreased his watering.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.560]  He was over watering his plants
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.360]  and you're supposed to really let them dry out
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  between waterings,
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.920]  let the top layer dry out between waterings.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.080]  And that really helped his fungus gnat problem.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.400]  And he also introduced nematodes.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.640]  So one thing you can do to monitor for fungus gnats
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.360]  is you can place yellow sticky cards in your greenhouse
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.640]  so that you can detect them early.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.360]  If you do have fungus gnats,
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.440]  you should allow the top layer of soil
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.520]  to dry out completely.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.720]  This will kill both the fungus,
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.280]  as well as which the gnats feed on,
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.800]  as well as the fungus gnat larvae.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.480]  So really let that soil dry out between waterings.
[01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:05.650]  This is the two-spotted spider mite.
[01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:07.810]  These are small little mites found on the underside
[01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:09.930]  of leaves and they cause this stippling appearance
[01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:11.370]  that you can see in both of the pictures,
[01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:12.930]  kind of on the upper surface of the leaves.
[01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.730]  You usually notice the stippling first
[01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:15.890]  and then if you turn the leaf over,
[01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:17.530]  you'll find the spider mites.
[01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:22.090]  These I found in the high tunnel as well as in the field.
[01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:25.090]  And both in the high tunnel as well as in the field,
[01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:26.370]  the numbers stayed fairly low.
[01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:28.370]  The high tunnel has since been harvested
[01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:30.650]  and no control measures were needed.
[01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:32.330]  And the populations in the field
[01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:33.850]  have never increased.
[01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:35.050]  I monitor it weekly and the numbers
[01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:36.770]  have stayed very, very low.
[01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:40.130]  Two-spotted spider mites do prefer very hot, dry weather.
[01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:41.650]  So one of the ways to manage for them
[01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:44.850]  is to make sure that your plants aren't water stressed.
[01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.210]  You can also remove any potential weed hosts
[01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:49.130]  that are surrounding your field.
[01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:51.730]  And then if you do have a spider mite problem
[01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:53.250]  or you know that you will,
[01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:54.730]  you can release predatory mites
[01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:56.730]  to control the spider mite population.
[01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:57.610]  But if you do do this,
[01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:00.850]  you have to do it in advance of the spider mites
[01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.170]  becoming out of control.
[01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:04.410]  So as soon as you have that first sign
[01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:05.690]  of two-spotted spider mites,
[01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:08.330]  you wanna release your beneficial predatory mites.
[01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:11.130]  This is the red-headed flea beetle,
[01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:12.850]  which was probably the most numerous insect
[01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:14.410]  that I observed this summer.
[01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:16.970]  The adults are fairly large, three to six millimeters,
[01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:20.410]  and have a reddish brown head and a shiny black body.
[01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:23.250]  They feed on the leaves between the veins
[01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:26.610]  and cause these holes all over the leaves.
[01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:28.050]  Even though they were very numerous
[01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:29.690]  and I saw quite a bit of damage,
[01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:31.170]  all the plants grew out of it.
[01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:32.890]  And the young seedlings are the ones
[01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:35.490]  that are most at risk from flea beetle damage.
[01:17:35.490 --> 01:17:37.690]  So some of the control measures you can do
[01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:40.250]  is you can protect your young seedlings with row cover
[01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:43.610]  until they're large enough to withstand the feeding pressure.
[01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:48.130]  You can also plow to decrease the overwintering population.
[01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.770]  And then you can use beneficial nematodes,
[01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:51.930]  which will control the larvae in the soil.
[01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:56.250]  I also found some aphids.
[01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:59.730]  These are small sap-sucking insects, kind of pear-shaped.
[01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:01.570]  They're found on the underside of the leaves,
[01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:04.890]  but they can also be found near the stem or in the flowers.
[01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:07.010]  There are several different species of aphids
[01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:09.250]  that are known to occur on hemp.
[01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.850]  Of the nine fields that I was scouting,
[01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.050]  only one of them did I find aphids in,
[01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:16.810]  and they remained on the lower leaves.
[01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:18.210]  And there was a lot of beneficials,
[01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:20.610]  including ladybugs and minute pirate bugs
[01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:23.970]  and lacewings that really kept the population under control.
[01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:24.970]  They are still out there,
[01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:27.170]  and I'm still monitoring them weekly
[01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.290]  to make sure that the population doesn't get any bigger.
[01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:31.890]  I did take a sample and I sent it
[01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:35.570]  to the Cornell Insect Diagnostic Lab for identification,
[01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:37.650]  because I don't know what species it is,
[01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:39.810]  but I only found the one in one field.
[01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:43.650]  There are a few different insects
[01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:45.690]  that will bore into the stem of hemp,
[01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:48.690]  including the common stalk borer, which is pictured here,
[01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.850]  as well as European corn borer and the hemp borer.
[01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:52.970]  The only one that I found this season
[01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:54.330]  was the common stalk borer.
[01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:55.970]  I've not found the other ones.
[01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.850]  I did set up traps for European corn borer,
[01:18:57.850 --> 01:18:59.330]  but the numbers were very, very low,
[01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:01.690]  and I never found any in the plant.
[01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:05.290]  So here's a picture of a larvae inside a hemp stalk.
[01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:08.570]  They are brown with these long white lines
[01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.250]  that run the length of the body.
[01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.130]  The female will lay her eggs in grasses and weeds
[01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:14.850]  kind of around the edge of a field,
[01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:17.010]  and when the larvae hatch,
[01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:18.170]  they will move into the field
[01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.370]  looking for a suitable plant to bore into.
[01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:21.890]  So one of the management options
[01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.850]  is to control your weeds and grasses
[01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:25.290]  in the surrounding fields.
[01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:27.090]  Usually, if you do have stalk borer,
[01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:29.010]  it's gonna be on the edge of fields
[01:19:29.010 --> 01:19:31.050]  where you're gonna find the damage.
[01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.810]  Another option is to plant your plants early
[01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:37.210]  so that they're large enough that when the larvae move in,
[01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.490]  they can withstand some of that boring damage.
[01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:42.290]  Chemical control options are limited
[01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:44.330]  because once they're inside the stem,
[01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:46.930]  they're protected from any kind of chemical control.
[01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:50.170]  This is the last insect that I'm gonna talk about,
[01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:52.450]  the yellow woolly bear caterpillar.
[01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:55.010]  This is a caterpillar that feeds on many different plants,
[01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:56.530]  including hemp.
[01:19:56.530 --> 01:20:00.130]  It's covered in dense yellow hairs over its entire body.
[01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.930]  And this one I found in the high tunnel that I was scouting.
[01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:04.570]  And usually it doesn't cause a problem.
[01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:07.650]  The female lays about 50 eggs on a host plant,
[01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:10.490]  and the caterpillars, they feed together for a little while,
[01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:12.450]  but then they disperse throughout the field
[01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:16.210]  and just cause a little bit of damage to individual plants.
[01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:17.930]  But because this was in a high tunnel,
[01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:20.210]  they were all concentrated in one area
[01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:21.650]  and they couldn't disperse.
[01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.770]  It caused much more significant damage.
[01:20:23.770 --> 01:20:25.290]  So when I was in there scouting,
[01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:26.690]  I noticed a lot of the plants,
[01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:29.810]  the lower third of the plant was completely defoliated.
[01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:31.770]  So I notified the grower about that.
[01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:33.010]  And what we ended up doing,
[01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:34.810]  he just went in and handpicked them all.
[01:20:34.810 --> 01:20:37.450]  There's probably about a hundred or so in the high tunnel,
[01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:38.530]  but he couldn't control them.
[01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:40.050]  Since it wasn't a defined area,
[01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:43.330]  he could just go in and handpick them all to remove them.
[01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:45.810]  And it didn't really cause any serious damage
[01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:47.810]  because we were able to get rid of them.
[01:20:49.090 --> 01:20:50.730]  So here just real briefly is a list
[01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.410]  of some of the other insects that I found on hemp,
[01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.890]  which includes the leaf miner,
[01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:56.210]  which I'm attempting to rear out
[01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:58.970]  to determine what species it is,
[01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:02.210]  four line plant bug, various caterpillars,
[01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:05.250]  different grasshoppers, brown marmorated stink bug,
[01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:07.290]  leaf hoppers, tree hoppers,
[01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:08.690]  the oblique banded leaf roller,
[01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:10.290]  I was able to rear that out,
[01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:11.890]  and the tarnished plant bug.
[01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:12.730]  So as you can see,
[01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:16.050]  there's a lot of different insects that are found on hemp.
[01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:17.450]  Not all of them are pests.
[01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:19.290]  So it's important to know what's a pest,
[01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:20.970]  what's an incidental,
[01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:22.250]  and of course, as I mentioned before,
[01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:23.290]  what are your beneficials?
[01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:26.210]  So that you can just control the ones that you need to.
[01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:29.330]  So if there's any questions, I will take those now.
[01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:30.810]  Okay, thank you, Marion.
[01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:34.250]  Marion is on.
[01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:37.210]  So I see a couple of questions in the chat.
[01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:38.530]  We have one minute here.
[01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:42.930]  If you wanna pick one out.
[01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:50.570]  There's a question about how prevalent corn borers
[01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:53.010]  have been in cornfields in New York,
[01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:57.530]  and will this corn borer population potentially impact hemp?
[01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:01.210]  Sorry, you can hear me?
[01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:02.050]  Yep.
[01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.130]  Okay, good.
[01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.690]  So European corn borer in general
[01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:09.690]  has been very low in the state for at least 10, 15 years now
[01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:13.290]  after the introduction of ET field corn.
[01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:16.450]  We do think it might start increasing.
[01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:19.650]  There's more non-GMO field corn being grown.
[01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:22.730]  So the European corn borer population might increase.
[01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:26.290]  What impact European corn borer is gonna have on hemp?
[01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:27.130]  I don't know.
[01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:30.250]  I have personally not seen any corn borer on hemp.
[01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:34.010]  I think hemp, it doesn't tend to lodge
[01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:36.210]  or break as easily as corn does.
[01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:39.010]  So it might not, when the corn borer gets inside
[01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:42.250]  the hemp plant, it might not have as much of an impact
[01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:44.410]  on the hemp itself.
[01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:47.450]  But having not seen it, I couldn't say for sure.
[01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:51.170]  And maybe one other question here.
[01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:55.930]  A question about beneficial control
[01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:58.410]  of two spotted spider mites,
[01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:00.250]  predatory mites versus ladybugs.
[01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:03.090]  Do you have any data on that?
[01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:04.210]  I don't have any data.
[01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:07.610]  I know that I've worked with two spotted spider mites
[01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:11.090]  in other crops and the predatory mites do a great job.
[01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:13.890]  I've never intentionally released ladybugs
[01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:16.290]  specifically for spider mite control,
[01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:17.490]  more so for aphid control.
[01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:19.570]  So I don't know how well the ladybugs would do
[01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:21.690]  on spider mites specifically.
[01:23:21.690 --> 01:23:24.130]  I do know that predatory mites do well,
[01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:27.050]  but I don't have any data on the ladybugs.
[01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:28.770]  Okay, great.
[01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.090]  Thanks, Marianne.
[01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:34.890]  We are going to move on to Lynn Sosnowski's talk here.
[01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:38.890]  So let me get that queued up.
[01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:43.250]  Oh, welcome to my talk about weeds
[01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:45.250]  and weed management and hemp.
[01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:48.170]  My name is Lynn Sosnowski and I'm an assistant professor
[01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:50.770]  of weed biology, ecology and management
[01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:53.490]  and specialty crops here at Cornell University.
[01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:59.330]  Weeds in any cropping system compete with the crop
[01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:01.370]  for water, nutrients and light.
[01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:06.370]  And that can directly impact yield quantity and quality.
[01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:08.450]  Weeds that become established in crops
[01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:11.330]  can alter the microclimates around the plants,
[01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:14.330]  which can then impact disease development.
[01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:16.730]  And weeds can actually serve as alternate hosts
[01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:21.090]  for both pests and pathogens in cropping systems.
[01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:23.650]  Vegetation that isn't controlled
[01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:27.050]  can reduce the final harvestability of the crop.
[01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:31.010]  And the absence of any kind of vegetation control chemicals
[01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.690]  in the hemp crop itself may necessitate the use
[01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:37.490]  of multiple and integrated practices
[01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:40.090]  to suppress weeds that become established.
[01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:44.610]  With respect to integrated weed management in hemp,
[01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:48.050]  the first step should always be proper site selection.
[01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:50.970]  And that means avoiding fields with perennials
[01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:54.130]  or extremely high weed densities.
[01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:55.450]  If you're gonna start clean,
[01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:58.170]  make sure to try and stay clean.
[01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:02.770]  Always manage and harvest your cleanest fields first.
[01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:04.410]  With respect to planting date,
[01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:07.930]  you might be able to plant and get ahead of weeds.
[01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:11.690]  For example, if the field that you're planting into
[01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:15.850]  has a lot of summer emerging weed species,
[01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:17.810]  choose an earlier planting date
[01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:19.450]  that allows your crop to get up
[01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:22.650]  and gives it some kind of competitive advantage
[01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:26.210]  against the vegetation it's gonna be competing with.
[01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:28.410]  Using a stale seedbed technique
[01:25:28.410 --> 01:25:32.170]  where you stimulate the germination of weeds
[01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:34.570]  and then eliminate emerged seedlings,
[01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:36.930]  both physically and chemically,
[01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:39.090]  can be a really useful tool.
[01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:40.850]  But understand that not all weeds
[01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:43.250]  are going to respond equally well.
[01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:45.850]  Species with non-dormant seeds
[01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:49.010]  might be better controlled under this strategy
[01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:51.810]  as opposed to species with dormant seeds.
[01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:56.930]  Make sure that you have the best planting conditions
[01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:58.690]  that you can achieve.
[01:25:58.690 --> 01:26:02.490]  For instance, making sure you have a nice even seedbed
[01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:05.250]  so that you have good soil to seed contact
[01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:06.970]  for even germination,
[01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:10.610]  which will improve the crop's competitive ability.
[01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:13.450]  Make sure that you plant with appropriate densities
[01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:17.770]  to minimize that open space that weeds can then colonize.
[01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:19.250]  If you're using transplants,
[01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:21.490]  this can be a really useful strategy
[01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:24.410]  to give your crop a competitive size advantage
[01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:26.050]  over the weeds.
[01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.890]  Choosing varieties can have an influence
[01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:32.090]  on how competitive the crop is as well
[01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:34.690]  based on the heights and the branching traits
[01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:38.210]  that that variety possesses.
[01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:39.610]  If you're going to be cultivating,
[01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:42.650]  make sure you keep your rows as straight as possible
[01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:45.330]  to maximize cultivation performance
[01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:48.330]  and get the weeds while they are small,
[01:26:48.330 --> 01:26:53.050]  either at the white thread or the early seedling stages.
[01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:55.170]  If you're using plastic mulch,
[01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:57.410]  remember that this is still going to require
[01:26:57.410 --> 01:27:00.570]  weeding between beds and removing weeds
[01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:03.370]  that emerge through the planting holes.
[01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:07.250]  So even though herbicides aren't available
[01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:09.010]  for use in hemp directly,
[01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:11.130]  they're likely to be used in crops
[01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:13.290]  that are planted before hemp.
[01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:15.650]  And we have to pay attention to this
[01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:18.490]  because these products have rotation restrictions
[01:27:18.490 --> 01:27:23.490]  on the label and hemp may not be explicitly listed,
[01:27:23.770 --> 01:27:26.850]  but the term other crop often is,
[01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:31.290]  and hemp is going to fall into that other crop category.
[01:27:32.190 --> 01:27:34.370]  So if you're interested in understanding
[01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:36.330]  the type of plant back restrictions
[01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:40.810]  that might be encountered in industrial hemp production,
[01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:42.610]  I suggest doing a Google search
[01:27:42.610 --> 01:27:46.970]  for the terms Wisconsin, hemp and rotation restrictions.
[01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:50.090]  And you're really likely to find this nice handout
[01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.850]  that was produced by UW Madison,
[01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:56.570]  which explicitly looks at the restrictions
[01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:58.930]  that are associated with the herbicides
[01:27:58.930 --> 01:28:02.290]  that are used in pre-seeding crops.
[01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:06.930]  These are some of the rotation restrictions
[01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:08.850]  that my colleagues at UW Madison
[01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:11.330]  found across multiple herbicide labels.
[01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:14.370]  And you can see they're extremely varied
[01:28:14.370 --> 01:28:16.450]  in the amount of time that you need to wait
[01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:19.210]  before you can plant industrial hemp.
[01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:22.530]  For example, for the Fusilade and Select Max labels,
[01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:25.490]  there was a one month rotation restriction.
[01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:28.850]  For something like Pursuit and Mazethapyr,
[01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:32.290]  there was a 40 month rotation restriction.
[01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:35.250]  Now understand the list is not inclusive
[01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:37.250]  and labels can and do change.
[01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:41.290]  And it is your responsibility to always consult the labels
[01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:43.890]  before making any herbicide application
[01:28:43.890 --> 01:28:48.690]  and before planting crops following herbicide applications.
[01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:52.330]  Just because we don't have herbicides
[01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:54.290]  currently labeled for use in hemp
[01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:56.170]  doesn't mean that we aren't looking
[01:28:56.170 --> 01:28:59.390]  to see how herbicides affect hemp.
[01:28:59.390 --> 01:29:01.290]  We have a lot of herbicide trials
[01:29:01.330 --> 01:29:04.410]  that are currently underway in the United States.
[01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:08.170]  And they're being undertaken for multiple reasons.
[01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:11.190]  The first of which is to identify active ingredients
[01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:13.210]  that will be safe to use in hemp
[01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:15.250]  and to address pest management needs
[01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.630]  in the US hemp industry.
[01:29:17.630 --> 01:29:19.970]  The second reason is to identify herbicides
[01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:22.770]  that will be able to control hemp escapes
[01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:25.410]  that occur in following crops.
[01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:27.810]  And the third reason is to characterize
[01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:30.230]  herbicide symptomology in the case
[01:29:30.230 --> 01:29:33.550]  of herbicide carryover or drift injury.
[01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:37.330]  While there's considerable interest
[01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:40.730]  in conducting hemp herbicide trials,
[01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:42.710]  very few have actually made it
[01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:45.530]  to formal publication stage yet.
[01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:47.250]  The one exception being some work
[01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:48.910]  that's been recently undertaken
[01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:53.690]  by Michael Flesner's group at Virginia Tech University.
[01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:55.430]  And this is a really good paper
[01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:58.090]  where they evaluated herbicide tolerance
[01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:00.950]  of industrial hemp in both greenhouse
[01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:02.630]  and field conditions.
[01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:06.030]  So the objective of the research
[01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:08.310]  that was conducted in Michael Flesner's lab
[01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:11.190]  was to test hemp tolerance to both pre-emergence
[01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:13.070]  and post-emergence herbicides.
[01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:15.390]  And when we say pre-emergence herbicides,
[01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:17.670]  we're talking soil applied herbicides.
[01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:19.950]  And when we're talking post-emergence,
[01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:22.830]  we're talking foliar applied herbicides.
[01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:24.650]  They did conduct this across years
[01:30:24.650 --> 01:30:27.290]  and they did do the studies in both greenhouse
[01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:29.150]  and in field trials.
[01:30:29.150 --> 01:30:33.190]  And what they saw was variability across time
[01:30:33.190 --> 01:30:36.790]  and between growing conditions.
[01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:38.950]  Although with respect to the results,
[01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:43.010]  they did find that S-metolachlor was the least injurious
[01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:46.110]  of the soil applied herbicides in the field.
[01:30:46.110 --> 01:30:48.790]  Although their greenhouse trials did suggest
[01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:51.430]  that other active ingredients may have potential
[01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:53.270]  for future research.
[01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:56.390]  With respect to the foliar applied herbicides,
[01:30:56.410 --> 01:30:58.370]  Quazalifop and Cethoxydim,
[01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:01.070]  which are both grass herbicides,
[01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:04.370]  were found to be the least injurious of the post products,
[01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:07.250]  along with clopyrilid and bromoxino.
[01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:12.250]  I'd like you to know that we're also conducting
[01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:15.670]  herbicide trials here at Cornell Agrotech.
[01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:19.210]  These are the results from a preliminary screening project
[01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:22.930]  that we've started to look at the safety of post-emergence
[01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:26.250]  or foliar applied herbicides and industrial hemp.
[01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:29.270]  And you can see that our results largely agree
[01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:33.590]  with those that were achieved by Michael Flesner's group.
[01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:36.910]  Primarily, if we're looking at percent injury,
[01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:39.990]  the post-emergence herbicides currently in our trial,
[01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:44.110]  providing the least amount of injury to hemp are clethodim,
[01:31:44.110 --> 01:31:49.110]  which is a WSSA1 herbicide, clopyramid and bromoxino.
[01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:55.050]  So we plan to continue these herbicide screens,
[01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:57.830]  both in the greenhouse and under field conditions
[01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:00.670]  this fall and in 2021.
[01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:04.390]  The previous slide showed you our post-emergence herbicides
[01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:05.270]  that we're looking at.
[01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:07.870]  We also have a suite of pre-emergence herbicides
[01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:09.190]  that we'll be evaluating.
[01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.990]  And again, we'll be doing it in both the greenhouse
[01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:14.270]  and field conditions.
[01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:16.830]  We hope to have some trials describing the impacts
[01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:21.230]  of herbicide carryover and drift on crop growth
[01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:23.110]  and yield development.
[01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:26.770]  We're also hoping to look at the biology of hemp
[01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:28.810]  and evaluate its competitiveness
[01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:30.650]  with both current weed issues,
[01:32:30.650 --> 01:32:34.610]  such as velvet leaf, foxtail, bindweed and nightshade,
[01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:36.770]  and up and coming problems in New York,
[01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:39.250]  such as Palmer amaranth and water hemp.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.820]  I'd like to thank you very much for attending today's talk.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.260]  If you'd like to get in touch with me
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:50.560]  to discuss weeds and weed management in hemp
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.660]  or in any specialty crops,
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:57.660]  feel free to contact me via email at lms438 at cornell.edu
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:04.280]  on my office phone at 315-787-2231.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:06.160]  If you're on social media,
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.980]  you can find me on both Twitter and Instagram.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:13.240]  Again, thank you so much for coming and attending my talk.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.320]  I'll be present during the break if you have any questions
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.400]  and have a good rest of your day.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:19.500]  Thank you.
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.860]  Okay, thanks very much, Lynn.
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:27.620]  We now have time for our Q&A session for about 15 minutes
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:30.420]  and then we'll take another five minute break.
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:35.420]  So I've seen if our panelists here could unmute,
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.100]  that would be great.
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:42.100]  And I'll try to pick out some of the questions from the chat.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:44.660]  There were some questions
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:49.680]  about seeing leafhoppers on hemp and gypsy moth on hemp.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.440]  Marion, do you wanna comment on the potential impact of,
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.040]  I think Joe meant potato leafhoppers?
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.000]  Yeah, so I did find some potato leafhoppers.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.120]  Oh, I don't remember exactly when,
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.720]  probably at least six, seven weeks ago now.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.240]  A lot of adults, they came in, I was concerned
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.920]  and within two weeks they were all gone
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.300]  and they did not reproduce.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.460]  Now I did hear from others that they have caused problems.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.580]  In the fields I were in, they never reproduced
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:25.600]  and it's mainly the nymphs that cause the hopper burn
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.740]  and a lot of the feeding damage.
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.580]  So I did not experience that.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:32.700]  I don't know if other people have had issues
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.140]  with leafhopper, but not that I'm aware of.
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:38.060]  And for the gypsy moth, those were in the high tunnel.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.900]  I found, I think about two or three.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.020]  I don't know if it's actually a problem.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.040]  It happened to be there.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.740]  I don't know how extensively they were feeding.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.520]  They probably nibbled a little bit.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.960]  I don't think that gypsy moth is gonna be a pest.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.960]  It's just one of those things that I found.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.020]  So I put it in the other insects I found category.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.840]  So one thing, if I have a minute
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.240]  just to mention one thing real quickly,
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.960]  I said that I found some aphids on hemp
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.320]  and I sent them to the diagnostic lab.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.060]  So I received verification that they are cannabis aphids,
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.560]  which is the first verification in New York.
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:15.460]  So we have it here just so everybody's aware of.
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.140]  Yep, we had a lot of aphids last year
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.620]  at the end of the season.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.340]  Did you get it?
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:23.940]  Did you find out what they were?
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.940]  I thought we did have them confirmed as cannabis aphids.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.060]  Oh, you did, okay.
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:32.180]  Okay, Elson had told me that was for,
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.860]  as far as he knew, his first verification, but okay.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:40.140]  Let me just point it to Jamie because again,
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.440]  in the Bionds lab, they have a lot of experience
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.860]  working with potato leaf hopper and hopper burn on alfalfa.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:50.420]  And I know Jamie, if she's still on,
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:55.420]  has seen some hopper burn on hemp in Ithaca,
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.640]  but she may not be on right now.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.720]  I can talk about that.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.820]  I was in the Ithaca fiber and grain plots.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.900]  I think last week, it might've been the week before,
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.300]  and there's considerable damage from potato leaf hopper
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.900]  on both, on all, on grain, dual and fiber.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:22.180]  And it is quite striking and remarkable.
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:24.940]  I am not an entomologist or insect person,
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:29.100]  so I don't know what stage these insects are,
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:34.100]  but it is occurring and striking, I will say that.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.980]  So I don't know if they have good years and bad years,
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.020]  but this was definitely a good year
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:43.080]  for potato leaf hopper on hemp in Ithaca.
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:43.920]  Yeah.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:44.980]  Yeah.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:47.840]  Going back to some of the earlier questions
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.960]  to Allie and Chris,
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:53.320]  folks were asking about whether we're assaying
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:58.320]  both the volatile terpenes and the non-volatile terpenes.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.360]  So unfortunately we haven't had the bandwidth
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.240]  to do as much detailed work on the terpenes
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.600]  as we would like, but Allie and Chris,
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.900]  where do we stand on characterization
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:13.940]  of all the different types of terpenes?
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:21.880]  So we're right now just looking at volatile terpenes.
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.820]  That's what we have standards for,
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:30.140]  and anything that's not a volatile
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:35.140]  were our cannabinoids generally, so.
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:35.980]  Yeah.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.960]  Right, so at the end of the season,
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.960]  we'll take flowers and get total cannabinoid analysis,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.280]  and we'll be working with Dennis
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:50.560]  to try to get a broader panel of terpenes as well.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.480]  Great.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.960]  There's a question from Jeff Kost here to Lynn,
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.440]  any work on ethyl fluorolin
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.720]  for pre-plant application in hemp?
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:04.540]  Has minor use approval in Canada?
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:10.360]  Yeah, and I just sent a written response to that.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.120]  So yes, there is some work that is being done
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.040]  in the US in various labs looking at ethyl fluorolin
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:21.580]  as well as the other dinitroaniline herbicides,
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:24.880]  so pendimethalin and trifluorolin.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.000]  I don't remember the exact results
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.680]  with ethyl fluorolin that I've seen.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.080]  There has been varied response in safety
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.360]  with respect to pendimethalin,
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:38.500]  but pendimethalin, ethyl fluorolin, and trifluorolin
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.780]  are all gonna be products that will be tested
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:43.020]  in our pre-emergence herbicide trials.
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.780]  Yeah, let me just throw out a question
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:51.080]  probably to everyone, and that is,
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:57.260]  what is the potential outcome of using some of these products
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:01.620]  on the test results for CBD extracts?
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:05.460]  So there is some evidence that hemp can concentrate
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.840]  some of these compounds, and we do know
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.680]  through our interactions with the folks
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.560]  at Fixus International that some of their hemp crops
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.620]  have failed in that final testing,
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:22.620]  so growers definitely need to be in contact with their buyer
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.140]  and understand the standards for testing
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:28.680]  that's going to be done in the final CBD product.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.460]  Anyone wanna comment on that?
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.640]  Yeah, I mean, that's exactly right, Larry,
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.320]  and I've actually interacted with now two different growers
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.320]  here in the state of New York
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.800]  that have gone through quality control testing
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.280]  and had either a microbial issue,
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:54.120]  so they're tested for heavy metals,
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.000]  for pesticides, and for microbials.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  And so it is important to know the final market,
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.540]  know what's going to be tested,
[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:06.440]  and then I guess I would throw it to Gary
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:10.920]  in terms of grain issues, which are really important as well.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.180]  I don't know all the answers to that question,
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:18.280]  and I think it's super important, as you stated there.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.540]  We were both on a conference at the plant pathology meetings
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:25.520]  where speakers from Canada were telling us
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.000]  absolutely nothing was allowed in end products,
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.160]  no residues of a biological control,
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.600]  no residues of any kind of chemical.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.780]  So I don't know if the US industry
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:43.780]  will be handled that same way, but it's a real concern.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.340]  We're focused on trying to reduce any potential
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:53.340]  for mycotoxins, which there's significant potential there,
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:57.020]  and that takes away a pretty big set of tools
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:00.300]  if we can't control things during the flowering process.
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:04.400]  So maybe somebody else on the call has some insights.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.920]  It's a real question.
[01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:16.810]  Lynn, do you have any insights on herbicide carryover
[01:41:16.810 --> 01:41:18.850]  or herbicide uptake from hemp?
[01:41:20.690 --> 01:41:22.650]  Yeah, that's actually a really good question,
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:26.410]  and that is not a topic I think that any weed scientist
[01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:28.530]  to date has actually addressed.
[01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:33.690]  In fact, a lot of the weed science work
[01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:36.150]  hasn't been addressed at all to date,
[01:41:36.150 --> 01:41:40.150]  and there was actually a paper put out last year in 2019
[01:41:40.150 --> 01:41:43.770]  kind of expressly saying how far behind we are
[01:41:43.770 --> 01:41:46.550]  with respect to all of these questions in the discipline.
[01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:49.750]  So there's more that needs to be done.
[01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:54.510]  Yep, and I'll just very briefly try to answer
[01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:57.270]  Paul's question about what specific soil testing
[01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:59.690]  would you recommend pre-planting?
[01:42:00.670 --> 01:42:03.950]  Again, I know we have discussed this
[01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:05.850]  with our colleagues at PIXIS.
[01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:09.470]  Hemp is particularly good at taking up cadmium.
[01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:16.030]  Lead, you don't wanna plant on a field that has lead,
[01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:18.630]  but we really have a lot more work to do
[01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:22.070]  to characterize what heavy metals
[01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:26.450]  you would want to test for and specifically avoid
[01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:28.790]  those fields in planting CBD hemp.
[01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:33.950]  There may be other pesticide residues also
[01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:36.070]  that you would wanna test for,
[01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:38.550]  but we really don't have a good handle on that.
[01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:39.950]  That's a very good question.
[01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:44.170]  It's an interesting question here
[01:42:44.170 --> 01:42:47.110]  or comment from Raul at Rutgers
[01:42:47.110 --> 01:42:50.710]  that they've had a substantial population of stink bugs
[01:42:50.710 --> 01:42:52.550]  in their CBD hemp trial.
[01:42:55.190 --> 01:42:58.870]  And Marion, do you wanna comment on stink bugs?
[01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:02.790]  So I've seen brown marmorated stink bugs
[01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:05.670]  and I found some stink bug egg masses.
[01:43:05.670 --> 01:43:07.030]  I've actually have some pictures
[01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:09.450]  of brown marmorated stink bugs mating in hemp,
[01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:13.150]  but have not seen a lot of feeding damage.
[01:43:13.150 --> 01:43:15.470]  You mentioned the majority of the feeding damage I've seen,
[01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:17.990]  but it's also hard to distinguish sometimes feeding damage
[01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:21.150]  if I'm not actively seeing the insect feed.
[01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:23.310]  There's a lot of other sucking insects
[01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:24.850]  that could have caused the damage.
[01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:27.750]  So I have not personally observed a lot of stink bugs.
[01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:29.730]  The only one I've seen is brown marmorated
[01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:32.210]  and a few stink bug egg masses.
[01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:34.890]  Yeah.
[01:43:34.890 --> 01:43:39.890]  I was also asked a question about spotted lanternfly,
[01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:44.810]  whether hemp might be a host for spotted lanternfly.
[01:43:44.810 --> 01:43:47.690]  So far, as far as I know in Pennsylvania,
[01:43:47.690 --> 01:43:49.370]  they have not seen,
[01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:52.130]  and I heard this from Alyssa Collins at Penn State,
[01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:55.330]  they have not seen any damage to hemp
[01:43:55.330 --> 01:43:57.610]  from spotted lanternfly.
[01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:59.750]  Do you have any insights on that?
[01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.670]  Yeah, I actually have no idea
[01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:03.330]  if they would get onto hemp or not.
[01:44:03.330 --> 01:44:06.750]  It seems to have a pretty broad host range,
[01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:10.790]  so potentially, but yes, I have no idea.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:21.220]  Here's a question from Josh with Palmer Amaranth in New York,
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.800]  what challenges might we see
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.900]  in regard to hemp production and harvest?
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:28.980]  Are hemp harvesters capable of doing a good job?
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.740]  So, yeah.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:40.160]  So obviously have not dealt with hemp and hemp harvest
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.240]  and Palmer Amaranth, but I have worked with Palmer Amaranth,
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:45.940]  which is the weed behind me in Almonds,
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:47.680]  actually in California.
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:51.820]  And yeah, that goes back to the harvestability issue.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.080]  You know, Palmer Amaranth gets very large, very quickly.
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:01.140]  It gets lignified and it can stop up cotton harvesters
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:03.500]  and corn harvesters.
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.260]  So I expect that a significant population
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:10.020]  will impede the harvestability of hemp as well.
[01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:14.260]  Yeah, I'll just comment that again,
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:18.380]  for high quality fiber production, fiber hemp production,
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.400]  there is a very, very low tolerance for weeds.
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.380]  So it has been a challenge for us
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:27.560]  in the absence of any labeled herbicides
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.260]  to maintain and to establish and maintain
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:33.720]  a weed spotless field that would meet
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.220]  those quality thresholds for high quality fiber harvest.
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:41.280]  For those folks who have been looking at the chat,
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.480]  any final questions you wanna address here
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.480]  in our last minute before the break?
[01:45:51.730 --> 01:45:54.730]  I'm gonna throw, there was a question about crop density
[01:45:54.730 --> 01:45:56.310]  and weed control.
[01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:59.650]  And that falls into that last bullet point
[01:45:59.650 --> 01:46:02.130]  from my slide of future research.
[01:46:03.010 --> 01:46:05.970]  That's gonna look at the competitiveness of hemp
[01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:09.950]  with various weed species and crop density impacts
[01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:12.570]  are gonna be rolled into that.
[01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:16.190]  So I don't, there is work that is being done,
[01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:17.970]  nothing by other universities,
[01:46:17.970 --> 01:46:19.410]  nothing has been published yet,
[01:46:19.410 --> 01:46:21.410]  but I'll be doing some of that work here,
[01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:25.010]  hopefully in the coming 2021.
[01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:29.270]  And again, in CBD hemp, at least we've relied
[01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:33.590]  on plastic mulch heavily for weed management.
[01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:36.790]  But as the industry shifts to more broad acre
[01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:39.350]  direct seeded plantings, those studies
[01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:40.610]  are gonna be critical.
[01:46:40.610 --> 01:46:42.990]  So it's great to have Lynn on our team.
[01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:46.950]  There is a question about Xerotol and pottery mildew.
[01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:49.170]  And I have tested that.
[01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:53.050]  So Xerotol is going to sanitize whatever it touches,
[01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:55.470]  but it will become ineffective very quickly.
[01:46:55.470 --> 01:47:00.470]  And so in what we have done to date
[01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:01.750]  and we are expanding this,
[01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:06.210]  but other products including bacillus based products
[01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:11.050]  and oil based products when applied prior
[01:47:11.050 --> 01:47:14.190]  to pottery mildew getting there are much more effective
[01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:16.470]  than the Xerotol in our studies.
[01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:18.990]  Great.
[01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:21.750]  Just one final comment here.
[01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:23.170]  There've been a couple of questions
[01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:26.730]  about recommending labs for testings.
[01:47:26.730 --> 01:47:29.970]  We're not going to recommend a particular lab.
[01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:32.690]  We don't have a validation protocol
[01:47:32.690 --> 01:47:36.290]  for validating the results from different commercial labs,
[01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:39.650]  but we do have a listing of potential labs
[01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:41.710]  that you can use in particular.
[01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:45.650]  Ones that can test for heavy metals and toxins
[01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:49.330]  are kind of rare, they're relatively few.
[01:47:49.330 --> 01:47:51.370]  And if you go to our website,
[01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:55.430]  we try to maintain a complete list of lab resources
[01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:57.790]  that you could potentially use,
[01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:59.690]  but I won't call them recommendations.
[01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:02.350]  So we are going to take a break here.
[01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:04.290]  It's 1056.
[01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:05.670]  So another five minute break,
[01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:07.910]  and we will be back at 11 o'clock
[01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:10.550]  with our presentation from Alan Taylor.
[01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:13.610]  Thanks very much everyone to our panelists.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:18.380]  Okay, it's 1101.
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:22.800]  We're going to move on to our third session here
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:29.240]  talking about supply chains and regulatory issues.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:33.640]  We are going to start with a talk from Alan Taylor
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.420]  on seed treatments and soil borne pathogens.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.280]  My name is Alan Taylor,
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:45.160]  and I'm professor of seed science and technology
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.280]  at Cornell Agritech.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.380]  My laboratory has been involved in hemp seed science
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:51.700]  and technology research
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.820]  since the Cornell Hemp Team formed in 2017.
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:58.180]  What I'm going to speak about today
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:01.500]  is on our work on the research and development
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.820]  of hemp seed treatments.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:07.060]  Gary Bergstrom is my cooperator in plant pathology
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:10.100]  as his laboratory is supportive
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:12.740]  in helping characterize the pathogens
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:17.160]  associated with disease seedlings from our research plots.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.020]  We also have field trials at North Dakota State
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:23.260]  with Burton Johnson and Chuck Johnson
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:25.580]  and John Fike at Virginia Tech.
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:31.500]  So the focus of our work is on application technology
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:35.320]  to begin with, to have good methodology
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:38.280]  for seed treatment and coding technologies.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.660]  This is a laboratory scale unit
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:43.920]  called a rotary pan technology,
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.240]  an R6 for a six inch diameter.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.580]  The same technology is used for commercial scale equipment.
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:51.820]  So anything that we do in the laboratory
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:55.380]  can quickly be scaled up to a larger.
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:57.380]  An issue that we had early on
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:58.940]  is that we need to ensure
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:01.580]  that we have uniformity of application
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:04.660]  over the seed surface and from seed to seed.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:08.240]  We need to protect each seed from attack
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:11.600]  of the soil borne pathogens at time of sowing.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.780]  We'll take a step back and look at the biological market
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.460]  because there's a number of materials.
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:19.920]  Now this is not restricted to seed treatments.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.360]  These could be foliar applications
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.360]  or soil applications and furrow applications.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.520]  We have bio fertilizers and bio stimulants,
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.480]  which we're not gonna be talking about,
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:32.320]  even though my laboratory is working
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.240]  with bio stimulant seed treatments.
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.760]  We're gonna focus on biological control products
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.760]  and particularly the bio pesticides.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.060]  So we're gonna kind of focus in on that area.
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.840]  So under the bio pesticides, we have bio chemicals.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.640]  They may be kind of a mineral based.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:52.720]  They can be either formed from copper or phosphites.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.600]  We have examples of those.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:57.080]  Microbials, we normally think of a microbial
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:00.420]  as a bio pesticide, but they're not the only materials.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:04.280]  But in this case, we are using specific seed treatments
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:07.720]  from bacillus and trichoderma and with others.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.920]  And these are commercial formulations
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:14.020]  that we are testing as seed treatments.
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:17.060]  So this is our list of 12 seed treatments that we have.
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.700]  Those in green are the biologicals.
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:22.480]  First thing we have to do is test
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.860]  the seed treatment application rate.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:28.100]  We wanna ensure that there's no phytotoxicity
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.180]  from the seed treatments.
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:32.380]  Those in red are the bio chemicals.
[01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:34.500]  Safeguard is an organic copper.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.900]  The prudent is a phosphite material.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:39.600]  And then the group at the bottom in blue,
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.400]  Apron XL Maxim, you probably recognize
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:45.900]  as these are widely labeled on vegetables
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:49.620]  and field crops for as seed treatments.
[01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:55.170]  So first, let's look at what happens
[01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:58.070]  to seeds after they're planted.
[01:51:58.070 --> 01:52:00.890]  We start off here in the laboratory to look at.
[01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:03.610]  Hemp seeds germinate very rapidly.
[01:52:03.610 --> 01:52:07.250]  So in this pathogen infested soil that we have the soil
[01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:10.710]  sprinkled over on top during the germination process.
[01:52:10.710 --> 01:52:13.990]  After four days, the seeds germinate very rapidly.
[01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:17.070]  After seven days, many of the seedlings have died
[01:52:17.070 --> 01:52:21.910]  or are dying and by 10 days, non-treated seeds are killed.
[01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:24.470]  So this is a way that we can use
[01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:26.390]  a laboratory screening method,
[01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:32.330]  taking advantage of a naturally pathogen infested soil
[01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:36.290]  to go ahead and to test these seed treatments
[01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:38.470]  before we actually go to the field.
[01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:41.630]  But our primary interest in showing you today
[01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:43.110]  is the field data.
[01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:47.030]  This is our two, we have two field studies at Cornell.
[01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:49.710]  The first one planted on June 12th.
[01:52:49.710 --> 01:52:51.670]  Again, now we can see how this color coding
[01:52:51.670 --> 01:52:52.670]  is gonna help us.
[01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:56.030]  The black bar on the left is the control non-treated.
[01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:57.870]  You see all the green treatments
[01:52:57.870 --> 01:53:00.150]  and none of the biologicals doing any better
[01:53:00.150 --> 01:53:01.310]  than the control.
[01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:04.910]  However, the safeguard, the organic copper,
[01:53:05.290 --> 01:53:07.250]  the prudent, the phosphate doing quite well
[01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:12.090]  and as good as one of our best apron maxim treatments.
[01:53:12.090 --> 01:53:13.970]  So this looks very promising.
[01:53:14.890 --> 01:53:19.690]  We have a second study also in Ithaca this year,
[01:53:19.690 --> 01:53:21.810]  planted on June 26th.
[01:53:21.810 --> 01:53:25.450]  Again, the same trend is the biologicals not performing
[01:53:25.450 --> 01:53:27.930]  any better than the non-treated control.
[01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:31.810]  We are seeing improvements with both the safeguard
[01:53:31.810 --> 01:53:34.130]  and particularly the safeguard and the prudent.
[01:53:34.150 --> 01:53:39.070]  And again, it's comparable to our best apron maxim treatment
[01:53:39.070 --> 01:53:40.670]  as the chemical seed treatment.
[01:53:42.670 --> 01:53:45.830]  This is where Gary's laboratory was instrumental
[01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:47.590]  in supporting this project.
[01:53:47.590 --> 01:53:50.190]  We would see the symptoms in the field
[01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:52.230]  as far as diseased seedlings.
[01:53:52.230 --> 01:53:55.610]  His laboratory has done the characterization
[01:53:55.610 --> 01:53:58.130]  of what pathogens are associated
[01:53:58.130 --> 01:53:59.550]  with those diseased seedlings.
[01:53:59.550 --> 01:54:02.390]  So we can see here on the picture on the photo
[01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:04.210]  at the bottom on the left,
[01:54:04.210 --> 01:54:08.370]  indicative of those testing positive for fusarium species.
[01:54:08.370 --> 01:54:10.250]  The picture on the lower right
[01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:13.230]  having pythium species present.
[01:54:13.230 --> 01:54:16.210]  Gary's laboratory is still ongoing work
[01:54:16.210 --> 01:54:19.290]  to characterize the species of these
[01:54:19.290 --> 01:54:23.470]  along with other samples that we have provided to their lab.
[01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:26.930]  As I said, this is a multi-state project
[01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:30.210]  and being a multi-state project is good
[01:54:30.210 --> 01:54:34.270]  in that we do not want to simply have seeds
[01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:35.470]  that are tested in Cornell
[01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:38.810]  that only have good control in the Northeast.
[01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:40.490]  So we've expanded the testing.
[01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:43.690]  We have seed testing at Virginia Tech
[01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:46.510]  in the Southern region and then North Dakota State
[01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:48.110]  in the North Central region.
[01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:54.270]  Again, the same color coding and the same scheme
[01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:56.270]  as we had in our previous slides,
[01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:59.990]  we see safeguard and prudent doing very well.
[01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:02.170]  From one study we have,
[01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:03.930]  there'll be one more study coming
[01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:07.370]  with data this fall from Virginia Tech.
[01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:09.090]  And then North Dakota State,
[01:55:09.090 --> 01:55:11.690]  in this case we're seeing the chemical seed treatments
[01:55:11.690 --> 01:55:16.250]  doing quite well in this one across the board,
[01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:17.870]  but still we're seeing, for example,
[01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:20.290]  safeguard doing a nice job.
[01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:23.130]  So we're gathering information now
[01:55:23.130 --> 01:55:25.210]  and the very good picture
[01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:29.690]  is that we're seeing some consistency in our results.
[01:55:30.650 --> 01:55:35.170]  From field to field and from location to location
[01:55:35.170 --> 01:55:38.050]  within the regions of the United States.
[01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:42.970]  So let's go ahead and summarize where we're at with this.
[01:55:42.970 --> 01:55:45.450]  Our biochemical seed treatments, the safeguard,
[01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:48.330]  which was the organic copper and the prudent,
[01:55:48.330 --> 01:55:51.290]  which is a phosphite, had good efficacy
[01:55:51.290 --> 01:55:52.570]  in all of the studies,
[01:55:52.570 --> 01:55:56.850]  the data that we have in hand at this point in time.
[01:55:56.850 --> 01:55:59.850]  The chemical seed treatments, Apron XL and Maxim,
[01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:02.150]  still had good efficacy.
[01:56:02.150 --> 01:56:05.230]  And again, these are tried and true chemical seed treatments
[01:56:05.230 --> 01:56:06.590]  that are widely labeled.
[01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:11.070]  Unfortunately, after two years of work
[01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:15.410]  where Syngenta was initially very interested in this project
[01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:19.670]  Syngenta is no longer providing support for hemp
[01:56:19.670 --> 01:56:21.430]  on any particular application.
[01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:25.050]  So it could be Syngenta herbicides and things like that.
[01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:27.110]  They're not going to be supporting those hemp labels
[01:56:27.130 --> 01:56:29.850]  in the United States, which is a big setback.
[01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:34.090]  So we really need other chemical seed treatments
[01:56:34.090 --> 01:56:37.450]  from another company to test.
[01:56:37.450 --> 01:56:40.090]  And we're looking into that at this time.
[01:56:40.090 --> 01:56:42.530]  Finally, the biologicals,
[01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:45.190]  and we've done now two years in a row,
[01:56:45.190 --> 01:56:49.290]  trying to test a good range of commercially available
[01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:51.490]  and use biological seed treatments,
[01:56:51.490 --> 01:56:54.210]  simply were not effective in our study
[01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:56.330]  to control damping off.
[01:56:58.110 --> 01:57:03.110]  So I want to thank people, first of all, in my laboratory,
[01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:04.390]  Hilary Maitin.
[01:57:05.290 --> 01:57:09.290]  Hilary kind of headed up all the field studies that you had,
[01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:14.290]  as well as gathering data from the other states,
[01:57:14.370 --> 01:57:16.570]  and then summarizing some of the data
[01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:18.530]  in the graphs that you're seeing.
[01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:20.530]  Michael Luce in my laboratory
[01:57:20.530 --> 01:57:23.610]  has done all the seed treatment application,
[01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:27.050]  a lot of the in-house testing as far as germination.
[01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:30.150]  Soil testing, soil bioassay.
[01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:32.470]  Masi's done a lot of the photographic work
[01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:34.450]  and other support work for this project.
[01:57:34.450 --> 01:57:35.990]  So very nice team.
[01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:39.270]  I'm very fortunate to have people working with me
[01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:41.230]  on this project.
[01:57:41.230 --> 01:57:43.230]  In Gary's laboratory,
[01:57:43.230 --> 01:57:47.590]  Jen Starr was really instrumental in working with Hilary,
[01:57:47.590 --> 01:57:51.150]  taking those field samples and doing the characterization.
[01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:53.190]  And Kevin in Gary's lab is helping
[01:57:53.190 --> 01:57:55.190]  at the molecular characterization,
[01:57:55.210 --> 01:57:58.050]  so we know what species are involved.
[01:57:58.050 --> 01:58:01.050]  Again, we work very closely with the company registrants.
[01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:02.290]  In other words, the companies
[01:58:02.290 --> 01:58:04.570]  that actually are producing these,
[01:58:04.570 --> 01:58:07.290]  we're working directly with our R&D people
[01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:08.890]  to make sure that we're testing
[01:58:08.890 --> 01:58:13.410]  the best biological, chemical, biochemical treatment
[01:58:13.410 --> 01:58:16.290]  that they would have available for this project.
[01:58:16.290 --> 01:58:20.130]  And finally, I want to thank support from IR4,
[01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:22.470]  but in particular for New York Ag and Markets
[01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:24.910]  for their continued support for this
[01:58:25.630 --> 01:58:27.650]  and for other Cornell hemp projects.
[01:58:27.650 --> 01:58:29.190]  Thank you very much.
[01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:34.070]  Okay, thanks very much, Alan.
[01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:36.070]  We're going to move on now
[01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:40.350]  because we have three short presentations
[01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:44.070]  from some of my colleagues in Cornell Cooperative Extension
[01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:48.710]  talking about their work on the economics and supply chains,
[01:58:48.710 --> 01:58:51.250]  starting with John Hanchard.
[01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:55.310]  Morning, my name is John Hanchard.
[01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:56.650]  I am with Cornell University
[01:58:56.650 --> 01:58:59.570]  and a member of the Cornell University Hemp Group
[01:58:59.570 --> 01:59:02.650]  that is stunning hemp production in New York State.
[01:59:02.650 --> 01:59:04.250]  Lindsey Paschow and Mary Ulrich,
[01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:05.890]  also with Cornell University,
[01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:08.610]  and I have been doing research and extension work
[01:59:08.610 --> 01:59:11.710]  on the economic aspects of growing hemp in New York.
[01:59:16.690 --> 01:59:19.070]  Lindsey, Mary, and I will be presenting
[01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:23.010]  update type information from an economics perspective.
[01:59:23.010 --> 01:59:25.030]  Based upon our cost of production work,
[01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:27.970]  I will describe the economic environment,
[01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:30.050]  the market signals, which growers considered
[01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:33.730]  earlier in the year regarding planting decisions.
[01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:35.750]  Lindsey will then provide update information
[01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:39.370]  for processing, retail, and consumer activities.
[01:59:39.370 --> 01:59:43.030]  Mary will discuss what do growers need to be thinking of
[01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:45.990]  to obtain viable hemp enterprises.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:52.040]  Cost of production and expected prices
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:55.520]  are key determinants of growers' planting decisions.
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.160]  Should I produce or not?
[01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:58.580]  If production makes sense,
[01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:02.780]  then how much should I plan to supply at expected prices?
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:06.260]  Acreage and production input decisions are involved.
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:08.340]  Item one.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:11.980]  Figure one contains information
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:14.920]  produced by Cornell University and others.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:17.580]  For Cornell University resources,
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:22.580]  please see hemp.cals.cornell.edu.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:29.600]  Cornell analysis for a plastic culture system
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:31.960]  suggests variable costs and total costs
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:36.960]  equal $12,600 and $13,100 per acre, respectively.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:41.760]  The Cornell work excludes a charge
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:44.060]  for the value of management inputs required
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.440]  and reflects pre-planting inputs
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:50.760]  tasked to the point where dry material is in totes,
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:53.960]  ready for immediate delivery or ready for storage
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:55.800]  and future delivery.
[02:00:58.650 --> 02:00:59.630]  Item two.
[02:01:01.290 --> 02:01:05.290]  The other studies use similar cost of production methods,
[02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:09.290]  but the items included in time periods considered differed.
[02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:13.130]  For example, the University of Connecticut values
[02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:16.130]  include a charge for management inputs required,
[02:01:16.130 --> 02:01:18.890]  various marketing expenses, and others.
[02:01:19.890 --> 02:01:23.190]  Variable costs for the five study
[02:01:23.190 --> 02:01:28.190]  ranged from $8,800 to $13,400 per acre.
[02:01:29.970 --> 02:01:34.710]  The five study average was $12,200 per acre
[02:01:34.710 --> 02:01:36.550]  for the variable cost measure.
[02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:42.750]  Total costs ranged from $9,200 to $19,300 per acre.
[02:01:42.750 --> 02:01:47.750]  The five study average was $14,000 per acre.
[02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:54.050]  Item three.
[02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:56.050]  Calculated break-even prices,
[02:01:56.050 --> 02:01:59.530]  the expected prices received that would cover variable
[02:01:59.530 --> 02:02:02.950]  and total costs using the five study averages
[02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:07.950]  equaled $1.31 and $1.51 per percent CBD
[02:02:09.210 --> 02:02:11.610]  per pound of dry matter, respectively.
[02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:15.470]  Given percent CBD equals six,
[02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:18.430]  dry matter per plant equal one pound,
[02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:23.430]  and harvested plants per acre equaled 1,550 plants.
[02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:31.110]  Expected prices for the 2020 growing and harvest year,
[02:02:31.110 --> 02:02:36.110]  late 2019 of about a dollar and early 2020, about 65 cents,
[02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:41.850]  relative to cost suggest a relatively unfavorable
[02:02:42.210 --> 02:02:45.350]  economic environment for hemp CBD.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:49.880]  Item four.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.600]  In summary, there are three aspects
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:58.080]  that this information supports.
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.920]  An unfavorable economic environment,
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:05.000]  unfavorable market signals, was being considered by growers
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.240]  as they made planting decisions early in the year,
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.340]  especially when compared to expectations
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.580]  for alternative horticulture crops.
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:19.360]  Risks and uncertainties still concern growers.
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.780]  A comment by Mary Ulrich, CCE,
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:26.240]  Eastern New York Horticulture Program,
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:30.020]  during a recent Cornell University hemp check-in call,
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:33.100]  summarizes the environment quite well.
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.480]  Activity, that is hemp production,
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:39.240]  is a fraction of what it was last year in the area.
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:45.300]  If you have questions or comments,
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:50.300]  you can contact me, John Hanchar, at jjh6 at cornell.edu.
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:53.780]  Thank you.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:56.820]  Thanks, John.
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:04:00.220]  Going to move on to Lindsay Paschow's presentation.
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:04.260]  Hi, my name is Lindsay Paschow,
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:06.120]  and I'm on Cornell Cooperative Extension's
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.160]  Harvest New York team.
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.840]  I will be discussing the supply chain
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:11.760]  for industrial hemp in New York State,
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.440]  with discussions about state of processors,
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.860]  a little bit about retailers and consumers.
[02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:26.310]  In May 2020, a survey was sent out
[02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:29.070]  to the hemp processors in New York State
[02:04:29.070 --> 02:04:33.170]  to find out what the state of hemp processing
[02:04:33.170 --> 02:04:34.490]  happened in 2019.
[02:04:35.530 --> 02:04:38.490]  Out of a little over 100 processors
[02:04:39.310 --> 02:04:41.710]  in New York State, only 24 responded.
[02:04:41.710 --> 02:04:45.150]  13 said that they did process hemp in New York State,
[02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:46.910]  and 11 said that they did not.
[02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:53.810]  We asked how much hemp did you process in 2019?
[02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:57.190]  11 respondents did not process any hemp,
[02:04:57.190 --> 02:05:02.190]  and then the hemp ranged between zero and 28,278 pounds,
[02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:08.210]  with a total of 122,088 pounds.
[02:05:09.190 --> 02:05:14.190]  In 2019, we asked what the minimum CBD content
[02:05:14.670 --> 02:05:21.330]  that hemp processors required from their growers.
[02:05:21.410 --> 02:05:26.410]  It ranged anywhere from zero to 12% of CBD percentage
[02:05:26.650 --> 02:05:28.450]  that they would like from growers.
[02:05:30.730 --> 02:05:34.210]  Then we asked processors what their processing happened to.
[02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:41.730]  This included hemp oil, seed cake, biofuel,
[02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:45.730]  plastic raw materials, hemp fiber, pellets,
[02:05:45.730 --> 02:05:50.730]  and that was for pellet stoves, extracts such as powders,
[02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:55.810]  base oil, protein, tinctures, flour, and CBD.
[02:05:59.290 --> 02:06:04.290]  In 2020, we asked processors what their processing
[02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:09.730]  capacity was for hemp.
[02:06:09.730 --> 02:06:14.730]  In 2020, we wanted to know what processors were looking at
[02:06:15.790 --> 02:06:19.570]  for their capacity for processing hemp.
[02:06:19.570 --> 02:06:23.110]  And the range is kind of all off the board,
[02:06:23.110 --> 02:06:28.110]  but included weekly basis of 200 pounds.
[02:06:28.810 --> 02:06:31.690]  Some processors said for a month,
[02:06:31.690 --> 02:06:34.290]  they could only do about two acres,
[02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:39.310]  or anywhere between 1,000 and 140,000 pounds,
[02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:42.550]  with also some processors responding that they could
[02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:48.470]  do anywhere from 6,000 to a million pounds within the year.
[02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:54.710]  There's not a lot of information out there
[02:06:54.710 --> 02:06:56.150]  in New York State about the state
[02:06:56.150 --> 02:06:58.670]  of retailers and consumers.
[02:06:58.670 --> 02:07:01.550]  This will probably be potentially a future survey
[02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:04.790]  to find out from retailers and consumers
[02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:05.950]  where the industry is.
[02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:10.290]  There's a lot of predictions online about how
[02:07:11.710 --> 02:07:15.950]  retail stores might end up closing because of COVID-19.
[02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:20.670]  You know, a lot of people can buy CBD locally,
[02:07:20.670 --> 02:07:22.710]  or they can buy it online.
[02:07:22.710 --> 02:07:25.070]  So the retail side's very unpredictable.
[02:07:26.050 --> 02:07:28.930]  And so is on the consumer side.
[02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:33.950]  There's large predictions that CBD consumption
[02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:37.750]  will continue to increase between 2020 and 2024.
[02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:44.630]  If you have any other questions about hemp processors
[02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:47.430]  in New York State, please feel free to reach out to me.
[02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:52.150]  My email address is lep67 at cornell.edu.
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:58.980]  Good afternoon, I'm Mary Ulrich
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.840]  with Cornell Cooperative Extension in Orange County.
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.720]  I too am on the hemp team,
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:06.600]  and I'm gonna address a little bit about risk and reward
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:09.020]  because of course the question this year
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:13.040]  is the reward of hemp, the potential for profit,
[02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:15.600]  balance out with the risk,
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:17.920]  because those two things should be
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:22.680]  in direct proportion to one another, but they may not be.
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:26.120]  And so has hemp been all rainbows and kittens,
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:28.080]  or is it a little wild westy?
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:30.260]  I've seen a lot of wild westy out there
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:31.660]  in the last couple of years,
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:33.700]  and so I'm gonna address a couple of ways
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:38.300]  to protect yourself from the bad actors
[02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:41.400]  and other potential negatives that occur.
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:44.900]  So how is risk measured and mitigated?
[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:47.020]  We use cost of production data.
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:50.100]  John mentioned that it's coming along,
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:52.260]  but the future market certainly is questionable.
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:57.140]  We certainly do need more interest from consumers
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:00.280]  to keep that price up, to keep the demand up.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:03.060]  We also mitigate risk with crop insurance.
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:04.400]  I don't know what the payments,
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.760]  I haven't talked to anybody who signed up
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:11.760]  for crop insurance, and I mean the USDA, FSA crop insurance.
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:16.460]  So I don't know what those payments are gonna be for 2020.
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:18.760]  My prediction last year was that they were either
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:20.400]  gonna be really good or really bad,
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:22.700]  and so we'll see what happens with them.
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:25.280]  I'm always curious to talk to people who've had insurance.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:28.180]  So if you've had insurance, please give me a ring,
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:33.180]  because private or the federal government supported ones,
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:36.580]  that would be, I'd love that information.
[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:38.940]  So and also one way to protect yourself
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:43.380]  or to mitigate risk is to have a contract,
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:46.340]  and of course with the 2018 Farm Bill,
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:49.380]  going to be brought into effect in New York State
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:51.160]  by the end of the year.
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:53.620]  There's lots of changes in the landscape happening,
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:57.120]  and of course we're not used to legislation changing
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:59.840]  so quickly around crops, but the last few years
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:02.320]  this has been quite a little roller coaster,
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.840]  so that in itself is a risk, that you don't know
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.680]  where things are gonna go legislatively.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:10.440]  Of course the big force majeure or the big risk
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.760]  is that FDA may decide to regulate the crop,
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:17.300]  particularly in the case of CBD,
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:22.300]  and that could have a huge impact on markets, production,
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:25.880]  if FDA said, no, no, this is a drug,
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:29.280]  and everybody has to have, just like a drug,
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:31.440]  everybody has to have the same kind of testing
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.600]  and monitoring, then there would be a lot of producers
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:39.160]  and processors that would no longer have a market,
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.600]  because they couldn't meet those requirements.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.200]  And so the other thing I just wanna say about contracts,
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:48.720]  you know, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.120]  and I'm gonna show you a flyer in a minute
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:55.140]  that can help you out in terms of contracts.
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:59.020]  So what's the biggest thing that I see as a problem
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:04.020]  with hemp contracts or hemp relationships right now
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:07.260]  is that there's no collective knowledge.
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:09.880]  You know, for produce we have the blue book,
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:13.580]  so the people can go look up buyers in New York State,
[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:18.340]  buyers are bonded, so that if a seller doesn't get paid,
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:20.460]  they can go to the state and get reimbursed
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:22.240]  through that bonding process.
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.280]  If, you know, they really didn't get paid
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:25.640]  for something that they sold
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:28.000]  and everything was supposed to be okay,
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.540]  and the seller just didn't get their money,
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:32.800]  there's a way to get it back,
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:35.240]  but in hemp that doesn't exist right now.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:37.600]  And there's no institutional memory,
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:40.560]  which we should have, or we have in other businesses.
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.920]  You know who is gonna pay you,
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:46.560]  you know who the traditional bad actors are,
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:48.920]  you know the guys who pay in 30, 60, 90,
[02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:50.380]  and the ones who don't,
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.100]  if you don't know your neighbors do,
[02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:54.840]  and so sharing information about that
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.860]  in other crops has been very open,
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:58.220]  in hemp it has not been.
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:02.220]  So even what little institutional memory is being gathered,
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:03.940]  it's not being shared.
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:08.940]  And so it seems like bad actors are going from farm to farm
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:12.660]  or from region to region and causing trouble.
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:14.820]  And certainly this isn't just about CBD.
[02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:18.380]  I've had it happen that folks selling grain came to me
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:20.040]  because they didn't get paid for their grain
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:22.400]  because the buyer said that it was moldy,
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:23.520]  but didn't tell me it was moldy
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:25.160]  until like three months later.
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:28.220]  So there's no way to trace back whose fault that was,
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:31.760]  it was just very unfortunate.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:34.040]  And so also very unusual relationships
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:36.400]  between value and cost,
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:40.320]  that the farmer needs to buy into the processing somehow,
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.320]  which is really not the case.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.880]  Ocean spray really doesn't need the farmers necessarily
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:49.600]  to buy into the processing part itself.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.060]  They might be a co-op in terms of selling,
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:54.060]  but do they own the equipment?
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:55.060]  Maybe not.
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:59.620]  Or orange juice companies or any of those,
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:03.860]  there isn't that same kind of need to be involved.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:05.340]  There's a lot of interest from people
[02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:08.380]  who have never been involved in agriculture.
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.300]  That can be a little bit of a problem.
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:12.320]  There's also what I call the billionaire rule.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:13.860]  There's a lot of folks running around saying,
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:15.220]  oh, I have billionaire friends.
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:18.440]  Well, unless you see a picture of him with Warren Buffett,
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:21.720]  like on his Christmas card, don't believe it.
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:24.320]  So one of the local growers actually said,
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.280]  if it's a good party,
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.080]  it'll still be going in a couple of years.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.480]  And if it's a bad party,
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:30.360]  I never wanted to go in the first place.
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.400]  He said that when questioned about why he was,
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.880]  cause he was gonna grow and then changed his mind
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:36.840]  in the last minute in 19.
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:40.320]  And so just using caution.
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.960]  So to try and look more closely
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:46.780]  at some of those contract details,
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:50.260]  there's this six page pamphlet.
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:53.060]  The first two pages are about production stuff,
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:55.460]  but then the next four about contracts.
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:58.680]  I wrote it with the assistance of several attorneys,
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:01.020]  agricultural attorneys.
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:04.020]  And so just have a look at that.
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:08.140]  It's on both the Cornell website and the hemp blog,
[02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.580]  which here's the pages.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:11.900]  And so the blog is on the left.
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.060]  That's what it looks like.
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:15.640]  And so there's regular news updates there
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:18.100]  and updates for meetings and things like that.
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:20.000]  There's also the link for the contract thing.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  And on the right,
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.400]  don't forget that Cornell has its own website
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:25.360]  and then the team,
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:28.400]  whether it's other people you've heard from today
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.080]  or John or Lindsey or myself,
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.760]  all of our contact information is also on there
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:34.920]  on the team website.
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:42.940]  Okay, thanks very much, John, Lindsey and Mary.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.840]  We're running a little bit over time
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:46.720]  and I see Chris Logue is there
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.120]  ready to make his presentation.
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:52.720]  So what I'm going to suggest if people can stay on
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.520]  is we will extend our Q&A session
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:01.200]  that will start at around 1155 beyond 12 o'clock
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.200]  if people can stay on.
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.380]  So you can ask questions to John, Lindsey and Mary.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:10.880]  But now I would like to move on to Chris Logue,
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:12.780]  Director of Plant Industry
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:15.900]  at New York State Department of Ag and Markets.
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:17.220]  Chris, you have the floor.
[02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:19.140]  Thanks, Larry.
[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:20.300]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:21.540]  Yep, sounds great.
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:22.440]  Excellent.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.620]  Trying a new headset today.
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:27.300]  So good morning, everybody.
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:30.220]  And the first thing I really should say
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:33.060]  is thank you very much, Larry,
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:36.500]  for having us here today to talk with you.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:41.520]  And I want to compliment you on a fantastic program today.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.560]  And also the fantastic research program
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:51.320]  and the great communication on industrial hemp
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:53.400]  back and forth with the department,
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:58.000]  as well as with the growers in New York State,
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.940]  as well as in other states.
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:05.680]  You know, everybody should have received a letter
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:09.840]  or all of our registered research partners
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:14.840]  should have received a letter via email earlier this week.
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:18.160]  That letter should also be making its way
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:20.720]  through the postal service as well.
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.400]  We wanted to be sure that we sent that out multiple ways
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:29.400]  so that folks would get the message as quick as possible.
[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:33.720]  We really spent the last six or eight months here
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:38.320]  in the department working on and looking at
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:44.040]  what the requirements of the 2018 Farm Bill Program were.
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:49.040]  As many of you know, we sent in comments
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.580]  on the federal interim rule.
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:56.160]  You all sent in many comments.
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:59.760]  There's a lot of commonality among those comments.
[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:05.580]  And identified a number of barriers related to
[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:09.900]  hemp for growers going forward under the 2018 rules,
[02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:14.500]  as well as for states going forward under the 2018 rules.
[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:19.500]  We had an informal deadline with USDA, AMS,
[02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:24.060]  the states did, as far as submitting plans
[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:25.340]  for consideration.
[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:29.260]  That deadline was August 15th.
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:32.640]  We were deliberating here within the agency
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:35.640]  and outside the agency, frankly,
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:40.040]  right up until that August 15th deadline
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:43.020]  about what direction to go in.
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:48.960]  Our decision at that time was that
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  we were unable to submit a compliant plan to USDA,
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:18:00.660]  which sets the stage for USDA to be
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:04.720]  the regulatory authority for hemp here in New York State.
[02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:10.900]  The authority of the 2014 Farm Bill,
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.340]  which is what we're operating on right now,
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:16.900]  you all know expires on 1031, 2020.
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:21.580]  It's our intention to run a 2014 compliant program
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:26.600]  up until that sunsets in October of this year.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:33.040]  That federal interim rule has many aspects
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.960]  that are inconsistent with what we believe
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.200]  the congressional intent was
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.120]  when the 2018 Farm Bill was passed.
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:47.000]  We think that intent was in line with what our beliefs
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.480]  here in New York have been,
[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:51.940]  which is to consider that industrial hemp
[02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:53.800]  is an agricultural commodity,
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:58.180]  and that the Farm Bill was really to continue
[02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:01.140]  to stimulate and develop the industry.
[02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:04.100]  Some of the things that we found
[02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:06.580]  particularly difficult to deal with
[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:08.140]  were the testing requirements
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:09.860]  and the destruction requirements.
[02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:14.140]  But there's a number of other issues that we and others,
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:16.740]  including growers in New York and other states
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:21.000]  have identified that are problematic.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.360]  We feel that the interpretation of this section
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:27.620]  of the Farm Bill and the corresponding sections
[02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:31.920]  of the federal interim rule really show
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:34.960]  that they've been most likely heavily influenced
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:38.080]  by Department of Justice and the DEA.
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:42.760]  Had a number of conversations over the past several months
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:47.780]  with USDA regarding what the legal boundaries are
[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:50.740]  for a state hemp program,
[02:19:51.980 --> 02:19:56.220]  and what could or would be approved in a hemp plan,
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:19:59.240]  and what the required regulatory activities would be.
[02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:03.220]  In the final analysis,
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:05.500]  the components of an approved state plan
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:07.820]  are essentially the same as federal oversight
[02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:09.280]  of the program.
[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:12.140]  In short, the rules are the same after 1031,
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:14.640]  whether the state or the federal government
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:16.640]  is the primary authority.
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:20.440]  And states that sign on for
[02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:25.140]  being the primary regulatory authority
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:28.760]  are really operating as agents,
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:31.160]  if you will, of the federal government.
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:34.680]  Our feeling is that submission of a compliant plan
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:37.840]  really is an affirmation that the state agrees
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:39.280]  with the federal interim rule,
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:41.300]  and it certainly legally obligates us
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:43.360]  to carry out the plan as submitted.
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.000]  Submitting a compliant plan
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:50.800]  with the intent of not following it
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:55.020]  really is, in our opinion, a disingenuous act.
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:59.120]  And we think that by not submitting a plan to USDA,
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:04.120]  New York State is really sending a clear message to USDA
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:06.560]  that the requirements are unworkable
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:10.540]  and unnecessarily burdensome to the states and the growers.
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:14.240]  We feel as though there are several states
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:17.840]  that are on the cusp of following us in this action,
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:19.800]  of not sending in a plan,
[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:23.480]  and not at liberty right now
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:27.240]  to name particular states that are considering this.
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:30.600]  We need to respect their sovereignty
[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:33.780]  and respect their decision-making process in that,
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:36.080]  but we do believe that you'll see some other states
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:38.920]  that take this action as well going forward.
[02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:43.460]  I wanna transition a little bit to the letters
[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:45.060]  that we sent to USDA,
[02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:46.660]  as well as the ones that we sent out
[02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:48.660]  to our research partners.
[02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:51.440]  They, both letters, reference our strong commitment
[02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:53.620]  to hemp in New York State.
[02:21:53.620 --> 02:21:55.620]  We as a department, as an agency,
[02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:57.780]  and I think as a state government,
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:00.940]  we're all still very much committed to hemp,
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:04.760]  as well as its economic potential for New York farmers.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:08.620]  I was very interested to see and hear
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.600]  the economic analysis that John Hanchar
[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:17.420]  and Lindsey and Mary presented earlier here today.
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:22.100]  And I saw some of the comments in the chat box.
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:29.600]  I think this industry is having growing pains clearly,
[02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:32.360]  but it still clearly has a lot of potential
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:34.740]  for New York producers as well as others.
[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:38.960]  So where are we right now?
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:41.640]  So getting back to our commitment to growers,
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:45.280]  we stand ready to assist our hemp growers
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:48.480]  with the transition to a federal licensing structure.
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:52.280]  We wanna have that be in the most seamless
[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:54.120]  and orderly way possible.
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:56.040]  We're gonna do everything in our control
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:57.180]  to make this happen.
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:01.800]  One thing that I think has really been a fantastic thing
[02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:03.880]  about the hemp program here in New York,
[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:06.020]  and I think in other parts of the country,
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:08.820]  and it's a real positive thing,
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:12.080]  is the enthusiasm and the entrepreneurship.
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:16.700]  And what we've seen in New York is that enthusiasm
[02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:21.700]  and entrepreneurship really has led to a lot of
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:27.460]  specific nuances in your business.
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:32.780]  That's a great thing that some of those nuances
[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:37.780]  perhaps complicate the transition over to the USDA program,
[02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:43.120]  but we are certainly gonna work with you
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:47.060]  to get you into that program in the best way possible
[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:53.140]  with the least legal and financial risk.
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:57.240]  We're gonna also continue to advocate for adjustments
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:58.360]  in the federal program
[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:00.800]  in a more flexible regulatory structure.
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:06.200]  So a couple things just to talk a little bit
[02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:10.000]  about some general information with the transition
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.400]  over to the federal side of things.
[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:16.080]  One thing that, again, is a really positive
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:19.080]  is that actually one of our staff people here
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:24.080]  at the department took a position with the USDA program.
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.000]  And so we have really a very strong relationship
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.760]  with the folks at AMS because of that.
[02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:33.260]  And we also have really good communications
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:37.580]  with the folks at AMS because of that connection
[02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:40.020]  with our former staff person.
[02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:42.340]  So we've had some initial conversations
[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.300]  about what we think this looks like.
[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:48.740]  So just a couple of general things that we're working on.
[02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:51.260]  And again, there are a lot of specific questions
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:52.820]  that need to be answered.
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:57.820]  And we're gonna work through those over the next weeks
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:24:59.340]  to help you out.
[02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:01.560]  But just a typical field grower,
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:04.640]  as we've had the conversation with USDA,
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:08.360]  that typical field grower should probably plan
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:10.160]  on having their harvests complete
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:15.160]  by the end of the 2014 Farm Bill Authority,
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:20.280]  and then proceed to register with the USDA.
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:22.240]  Once you're registered with the USDA,
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:25.240]  you're gonna be subject to the federal requirements.
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:27.400]  Our understanding is that you cannot have
[02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:30.100]  the federal license and the state registration
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:31.260]  at the same time.
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:34.660]  You also wanna have all of your testing
[02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:36.860]  of the current year's crop done
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:39.620]  and in hand before that happens.
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:44.380]  So the complicating factors are gonna be places
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:47.060]  that are growing plants for planting,
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:51.740]  or perhaps that have their plants in greenhouses.
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:54.040]  And we're gonna work closely with those folks.
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:25:59.900]  Couple things on sampling.
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:03.460]  So the USDA program does not require the sampler
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:06.860]  or the lab at this point to be DEA registered at this time.
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:10.160]  I think in the original version of the interim rule,
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:12.700]  they did have that requirement.
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:15.220]  We think this potentially creates some opportunity
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:17.780]  for some service providers in the state,
[02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:20.480]  whether they be soil and water conservation folks,
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:22.140]  or certified crop advisors,
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:25.860]  or perhaps organic certifiers to help out
[02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:28.520]  with the sampling requirements.
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:31.040]  And we're told that there are some good training resources
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:33.960]  for potential samplers on the USDA website.
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:39.160]  Little bit here quickly on the federal application process
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:41.480]  and reporting under the federal program.
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.600]  The first step in the federal process
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.600]  is gonna be to get your FBI background check.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:52.480]  You have to have that in hand at the time of application.
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.760]  It can be no older than 60 days old
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.900]  when it's submitted to the USDA.
[02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:02.900]  I'm told that USDA is having some interactions
[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:06.460]  with New York growers that some of the issues
[02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:08.540]  around the postal service right now
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:13.900]  are creating a little bit of a delay in background checks.
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:18.400]  There is a web-based service that can do a background check,
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:21.260]  which is, I'm told, more expensive.
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:24.420]  I think it's $50 rather than $18.
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:26.440]  But we'll try to get that information
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:28.300]  linked up on our website soon.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.740]  Once you've got the background check in plan in hand,
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:38.000]  I should say, you would fill out your application.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.440]  It's a one-pager.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:43.320]  There is no fee associated with that application.
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:47.140]  It would get submitted to USDA.
[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:49.520]  And we're in conversations with USDA
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:51.960]  about whether those applications
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:53.920]  should be coming in right now,
[02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:58.220]  or whether they should be held until November 1st.
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:02.280]  One of the things that is a factor in this
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:06.120]  is as other states make a similar decision
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.020]  to what the decision that we made here,
[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:12.620]  their licensing volume is going to increase.
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:14.460]  Either way, what we think will happen
[02:28:14.460 --> 02:28:17.360]  is that the licenses on the federal side
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:20.920]  will be issued with an effective date of November 1st, 2020.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.640]  So once the license is reviewed,
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:27.520]  or the application is reviewed on the federal side,
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:30.720]  the successful applicant is gonna receive
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:32.360]  the license document.
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:34.880]  And then you would need to go to
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:37.880]  the local USDA FSA Service Center
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:43.760]  to register your specific production locations.
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:47.040]  I'm told that that information
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:50.360]  is going to then be shared
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:54.160]  with law enforcement authorities.
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:59.360]  My experience with FSA is that they have
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:03.280]  very robust GIS capabilities.
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:07.000]  And so that may actually result
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  in some better communication with law enforcement.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.760]  So a couple things where we'll still be involved
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:20.400]  here at Ag and Markets.
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:25.400]  Certainly, we still see a very strong role for us here
[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:30.480]  around the issues around seed quality, seed certification.
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:34.920]  We've talked quite a bit with some of the seed suppliers
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:39.360]  about being in compliance with the seed laws.
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:43.320]  We'll also be working, continue to work on plant health
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:45.320]  and plant quality issues.
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:48.560]  If you're a producer who is selling hemp transplants
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:52.400]  to other entities, you would continue to maintain
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:56.280]  your nursery grower registration with us.
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:29:59.240]  You would continue to have an inspection
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:02.560]  once per two year licensing cycle
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:07.360]  to document the health of the plant material
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.020]  coming out of your operation.
[02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:14.440]  So we still have a long list of questions to answer.
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:16.640]  Again, I wanna reaffirm the commitment we have
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.440]  to all of you.
[02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:23.440]  I know following my presentation here or my comments here,
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:26.480]  we've got one of my colleagues, Pat,
[02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:28.800]  with the Department of Health,
[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:32.040]  who's gonna talk about where we're going on processing.
[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:37.040]  And please keep in mind, we're here to help you
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:41.840]  and to make this transition as pain-free
[02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:43.960]  and easy as possible.
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:45.360]  So I appreciate it.
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:48.320]  Also wanna say that I appreciate very much
[02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:52.000]  the great way that all of our field staff and inspectors
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.380]  has been treated by this industry.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:58.880]  It's been a real pleasure working with all of you.
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:00.280]  We'll continue to work with you
[02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:02.720]  and help you in any way that we can.
[02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:05.800]  And as always, we're here for you.
[02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:06.640]  Thank you.
[02:31:08.040 --> 02:31:10.320]  Thanks very much, Chris.
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:12.880]  And again, it has been a great research partnership
[02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:14.540]  with New York State Ag and Markets.
[02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:17.420]  We hope to find a way to continue that.
[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:24.520]  I will say that your name is still listed
[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:29.220]  on the USDA AMS website as the contact for New York State.
[02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:32.160]  So I sent an email this morning to USDA
[02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:35.980]  to try to find out who our contact will be
[02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:39.420]  with USDA in New York State when we have questions.
[02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:44.620]  But yeah, a lot of the questions in the chat box right now
[02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:48.100]  refer to the future of CBD processing
[02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:50.300]  and processing licensing.
[02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:53.580]  So I am just gonna move right on to Pat McKeach
[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:55.060]  from the Department of Health.
[02:31:55.060 --> 02:31:57.260]  And he can describe what the future
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:32:01.660]  of CBD processing regulations will be in New York State.
[02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:02.500]  Pat.
[02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:05.380]  Great, thank you.
[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:06.480]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:08.900]  Yep, sounds great.
[02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:10.180]  Awesome.
[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:11.820]  So my name is Pat McKeach
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:14.820]  and I work for the New York State Department of Health.
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:16.140]  And I'm part of the team here
[02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:18.900]  setting up the cannabinoid hemp program.
[02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:22.500]  And as Chris was, I'd like to echo what Chris was saying.
[02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:25.660]  This has been an absolutely phenomenal presentation
[02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:27.660]  this morning, learned so much.
[02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:29.780]  And so thank you to Larry for inviting us
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:31.900]  and allowing us to kind of give an update
[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:34.940]  on the cannabinoid hemp program here.
[02:32:35.860 --> 02:32:38.460]  Unfortunately, we were hoping that the regulations
[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:40.100]  were gonna be out by now.
[02:32:40.100 --> 02:32:41.900]  So we could kind of get a little bit more
[02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:43.380]  into the meat and potatoes
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:45.060]  of what the program will look like.
[02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:48.180]  But we are being told that they're at the last stage
[02:32:48.180 --> 02:32:49.260]  of approval.
[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:50.940]  So we're hoping they'll be out
[02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:53.100]  within the next couple of weeks here,
[02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:54.740]  which will kind of give a clearer picture
[02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:58.100]  of everything that will be in the program.
[02:32:58.100 --> 02:33:01.140]  I also wanna highlight that there's a public comment period
[02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:03.460]  associated with those regulations.
[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:07.980]  So you guys are obviously involved in the industry,
[02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:10.100]  studying the industry, experts in hemp
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:13.660]  and what's kind of the cutting edge movement now.
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:16.860]  And we definitely encourage you guys to send comments
[02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:19.500]  because we're not gonna get everything right
[02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:20.660]  the first time.
[02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:24.460]  And viewing this more as a partnership
[02:33:24.460 --> 02:33:27.100]  will definitely help us make the best
[02:33:27.100 --> 02:33:28.900]  cannabinoid hemp program we can.
[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:31.660]  And I think we're up to now, what,
[02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:34.940]  16 different states that have their own unique
[02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:38.900]  kind of cannabinoid hemp or CBD regulations out there.
[02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:42.300]  So it really is a rapidly developing
[02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:44.260]  regulatory framework right now.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:47.060]  There's a patchwork of different states
[02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:48.660]  and we borrowed a little bit from others.
[02:33:48.660 --> 02:33:50.580]  We borrowed a little bit from the dietary supplement
[02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:52.940]  industry, from the food regulations.
[02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:56.460]  And we're hoping just to make something that works
[02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:57.700]  and is flexible.
[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:00.980]  So getting started today,
[02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:02.140]  I just wanna talk a little bit
[02:34:02.140 --> 02:34:03.580]  about the legislative background,
[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:06.380]  kind of the history of how the bill came to pass
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:10.540]  and why it was kind of placed at the Department of Health
[02:34:10.540 --> 02:34:12.620]  medical marijuana program.
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:15.100]  And we'll go over the program objectives
[02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:17.260]  for what we're trying to accomplish here.
[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:19.300]  Brief description of the different license types,
[02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:21.300]  which is processors and retailers.
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:23.500]  Look at the product standards
[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:25.620]  that we're trying to hold these to.
[02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:28.580]  And really those are really building off of the great work
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:30.940]  that Ag and Markets has already done.
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:33.340]  And then a quick timeline and next steps.
[02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:35.660]  So we can kind of telegraph
[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:38.100]  what the next three to six months will look like.
[02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:41.300]  So as many of you are probably aware,
[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:43.540]  a bill passed in early 2020,
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:46.660]  establishing a hemp program in New York state.
[02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:50.820]  And as Chris just mentioned in the last segment there,
[02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:54.580]  the USDA will actually be regulating cultivation
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:58.300]  for the 2021 grow season due to kind of
[02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:01.660]  the cumbersome requirements with the interim final rule.
[02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:05.380]  And then the processing and retailing of cannabinoid hemp
[02:35:05.380 --> 02:35:08.380]  will be going over to the Department of Health.
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:10.940]  Now, it was really placed there
[02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:12.900]  to kind of build off the expertise
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:14.220]  that had been developed
[02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:16.860]  from regulating the medical marijuana program.
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:18.660]  There's a lot of synergies in terms of
[02:35:18.660 --> 02:35:21.060]  how the plant is extracted,
[02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:22.780]  packaging and labeling requirements,
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:25.780]  manufacturing requirements, testing.
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.820]  So we figured it would be a good place
[02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:31.380]  to kind of merge and always thinking about the taxpayer,
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:32.820]  sharing some resources here
[02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:37.500]  so we can get a good headstart.
[02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:41.780]  And I wanna highlight this first sub-bullet here
[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:43.740]  about the transition from a research program
[02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:45.580]  to a traditional license program,
[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:48.020]  because it is really significant.
[02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:50.140]  When Ag and Markets first developed their program
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:53.660]  back in 2015, it was really focused on
[02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:55.620]  what we heard today in research.
[02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:58.740]  And then all of a sudden CBD exploded
[02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:00.060]  and everyone wanted to grow it,
[02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:01.700]  everyone wanted to process it.
[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:05.140]  And it became much more about the marketability
[02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:08.980]  and the commercialization aspects of hemp,
[02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:11.220]  which is great, but under a research program,
[02:36:11.220 --> 02:36:14.260]  you're kind of limited in the sort of relationship
[02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:17.260]  between the regulator and the licensee.
[02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:19.660]  So under this new framework,
[02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:21.860]  we're hoping that we can really grow
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:24.580]  and help develop the hemp industry in New York State.
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:27.020]  So what are we talking about?
[02:36:27.020 --> 02:36:28.620]  Cannabinoid hemp.
[02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:30.460]  Cannabinoid hemp is defined as any product
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:32.700]  that is used for its cannabinoid content
[02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:35.700]  for human consumption or topical application.
[02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:38.780]  So hemp seed oil, hemp protein powder,
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:43.060]  those are, you know, GRAS, they're regulated as food,
[02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:45.460]  they would still be under Ag and Markets purview
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:49.380]  and industrial applications and, you know,
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:52.580]  bioplastic textiles, that's not part of the scope
[02:36:52.580 --> 02:36:53.780]  of the program either.
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:56.260]  We're really focused on things that are being sold
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:36:58.060]  for their cannabinoid content and being, you know,
[02:36:58.060 --> 02:37:00.620]  ingested in the human body or applied to the skin.
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:04.460]  And also want to highlight that it was a conscious choice
[02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:08.220]  to use cannabinoids rather than calling it the CBD program.
[02:37:08.220 --> 02:37:10.900]  You know, I think we heard from the panel this morning,
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:13.820]  you know, CBG is getting big, terpenes,
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:16.780]  and those come up daily.
[02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:19.660]  And I'm not going to comment on it,
[02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:22.060]  but we're getting, or I'm seeing a bunch of articles
[02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:27.060]  about Delta-8 THC and what the 2018 Farm Bill
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:29.620]  might've done to impact that.
[02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:33.820]  So it's always interesting to be involved in this industry.
[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:37.900]  So what we're really trying to do here
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:40.780]  at the Department of Health in terms of objectives
[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:42.020]  is the first one here,
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:44.180]  is we just want to comprehensively regulate
[02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:46.540]  cannabinoid hemp products in New York State.
[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:48.580]  So when we were drafting the regulations
[02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:50.260]  and we were talking to people in the industry
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:53.780]  or just people kind of in New York State,
[02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:55.980]  there's so much ambiguity right now.
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:58.780]  And because of the lack of federal guidance,
[02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:01.860]  that some of the most common questions are just like,
[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:03.660]  what's allowed and what's not allowed.
[02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:07.140]  So that's definitely one of the main focuses of the program
[02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:09.620]  is just trying to provide a clear baseline
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:12.340]  of what will be allowed in New York State.
[02:38:13.420 --> 02:38:16.340]  The second bullet point here is definitely a huge pillar,
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:19.060]  especially for us at the Department of Health,
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:22.980]  consumer protection and quality control standards
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:25.380]  are a huge, huge aspect of the program.
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:27.740]  We wanna make sure that products on the shelf
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:29.700]  have been tested, are labeled properly
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:31.620]  and manufactured to a certain standard
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:34.900]  and give consumers some assurance
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:36.780]  that when they're buying something,
[02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:39.180]  it actually contains cannabinoids,
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:40.460]  they're not getting ripped off
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:43.180]  and they have the appropriate warnings or disclosures
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:44.500]  of what's in the bottle.
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:48.140]  And kind of tied into that is this last point
[02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:50.100]  about education and enforcement.
[02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:52.340]  So we definitely understand that,
[02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:54.100]  you can have the best rules in the world,
[02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:55.900]  but if people aren't following them
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:59.980]  or they're not being enforced, it doesn't really matter.
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:02.140]  So education and enforcement are gonna be
[02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:04.260]  a really key pillar of the program.
[02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:08.460]  And we're small now, but we're hoping that we can ramp up
[02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:10.940]  in terms of resources over the next few years
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:14.740]  and dedicate a lot of those resources to that effort.
[02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:19.740]  So a quick overview of the license types in the new program.
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:22.780]  We split the processor into two different licenses.
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:26.060]  So there's the extraction and manufacturing license
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:28.780]  and then the manufacturing only license.
[02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:32.500]  The key difference here is really the extractor license
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:35.020]  because you're using different equipment
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:36.660]  and different technologies
[02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:39.380]  and there's a different level of risk for extraction,
[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:42.300]  that is gonna be its own kind of a license type,
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:45.020]  assuming that not every business will wanna do that.
[02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:46.900]  And then the manufacturing only license
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:49.900]  will be businesses who are purchasing
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:51.380]  kind of that intermediary product
[02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:52.620]  that's already been extracted.
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:55.740]  So your isolates, distillates, whole plant extracts
[02:39:55.740 --> 02:39:58.020]  and then manufacturing a product from there.
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:00.660]  So really just the idea there was just
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:03.100]  allowing different opportunities for businesses
[02:40:03.100 --> 02:40:07.220]  to enter the supply chain based on their business model.
[02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:12.180]  And the last license here is the hemp retail license.
[02:40:12.940 --> 02:40:15.300]  Our idea here is really to make it more of a permit
[02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:16.820]  or a registration.
[02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:18.660]  This is just a way for the department
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:20.060]  to kind of get some insight
[02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:22.580]  into where these products are being sold.
[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:24.620]  And then also gets our foot in the door
[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:26.420]  so we can start educating these retailers
[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:29.540]  about how to source a quality cannabinoid hemp product,
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:31.620]  what to look for on the label, has it been tested?
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:34.780]  Does it say how many milligrams of CBD are in it?
[02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:38.580]  And from there, we'll have a piece of paper that says,
[02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:41.500]  well, you agreed that you were gonna check for the X, Y, and Z
[02:40:42.180 --> 02:40:44.340]  and you're not, so that'll kind of help us
[02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:46.780]  on the enforcement side as well.
[02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:50.260]  And again, there's potentially 10,000 places
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:54.540]  in New York state that could be selling cannabinoid products
[02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:55.660]  within the first year.
[02:40:58.140 --> 02:40:59.740]  So the product standards,
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:04.020]  for those of you who are research partners
[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:06.220]  in the Ag and Markets program right now,
[02:41:06.220 --> 02:41:09.500]  a lot of these bullet points should look really familiar.
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:12.100]  Thank you, Chris, for creating a great program over there.
[02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:15.460]  We plagiarized, copied, and stole a lot of good ideas
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:16.980]  from that program.
[02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:19.260]  So in regards to manufacturing,
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:22.580]  we don't wanna reinvent the wheel here.
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:26.100]  There's already good regulations out there
[02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:28.020]  in terms of good manufacturing processes
[02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:30.340]  for both food and dietary supplements.
[02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:33.380]  And we kinda wanna build off that as a foundation
[02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:37.820]  and then layer on those additional concerns
[02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:39.300]  that are unique to cannabis.
[02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:42.900]  So packaging and labeling is a great example.
[02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:45.340]  Because this is such a new industry,
[02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:47.220]  it's all about consumer awareness.
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:49.460]  We wanna make sure the consumer knows
[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:50.620]  what they're putting in their body,
[02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:53.700]  how much they're consuming.
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:55.940]  There's a QR code so they can check
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:58.980]  that the product has been tested and labeled.
[02:41:58.980 --> 02:42:00.860]  And then warnings and disclosures
[02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:02.180]  are also extremely important,
[02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:05.460]  especially when you're talking about a full spectrum product
[02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:08.540]  that could potentially cause someone to fail a drug test.
[02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:10.180]  You wanna be upfront about that information
[02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:12.260]  because that could affect someone's life.
[02:42:12.260 --> 02:42:14.900]  So we're looking to add things like that.
[02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:18.100]  In regards to laboratory testing,
[02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:23.260]  we're going with the 17025 ISO accreditation.
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:26.940]  A couple other states are also going with that.
[02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:30.540]  I think it's popular in the medical marijuana
[02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:33.220]  and adult use industry as well.
[02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:34.900]  So we're kinda building off that.
[02:42:34.900 --> 02:42:36.700]  And as these programs grow,
[02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:39.100]  the quality of the third-party lab sector
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:40.820]  should also grow with it.
[02:42:40.820 --> 02:42:44.060]  So that'll be definitely a work in progress.
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:46.140]  We're requiring a full panel of testing
[02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:48.100]  for cannabinoid hemp products.
[02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:50.180]  I mean, similar to the medical marijuana
[02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:52.020]  and the adult use standards,
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:53.260]  you're still putting it in your body
[02:42:53.260 --> 02:42:56.740]  so it should be tested for residual solvents,
[02:42:56.740 --> 02:42:59.620]  microbials, heavy metals, et cetera.
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:05.420]  That really is the program in a nutshell.
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:07.100]  I wanna highlight again
[02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:10.340]  that the regulations should be out relatively soon.
[02:43:10.340 --> 02:43:13.780]  We definitely encourage everyone to give feedback on them.
[02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:14.740]  And I also wanna highlight
[02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:16.620]  that they are proposed regulations.
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:18.940]  So things will not be written in stone.
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:21.340]  We'll have opportunities to make changes
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:24.340]  and new licenses should be available.
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:27.580]  We're shooting for early 2021.
[02:43:27.580 --> 02:43:30.660]  We're on the processor side and the retail side.
[02:43:30.660 --> 02:43:32.340]  So please be on the lookout
[02:43:32.340 --> 02:43:34.300]  for additional information there.
[02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:37.780]  We're working on setting up a cannabinoid hemp website
[02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:39.660]  so we can post some of this stuff online
[02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:41.780]  and also setting up a call center number
[02:43:41.780 --> 02:43:44.180]  so we can take your calls.
[02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:46.540]  We do have a shared email that's on my next slide.
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:48.340]  I can share that at the end here.
[02:43:49.580 --> 02:43:51.700]  But quickly, the last point here is
[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:54.340]  we also are working in tandem with Ag and Market
[02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:56.740]  on the transition of existing research partners
[02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:58.860]  over to the DOH program.
[02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:01.500]  So we really wanna make that as seamless as possible.
[02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:02.380]  As I already mentioned,
[02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:04.420]  a lot of the requirements will be similar.
[02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:06.220]  So it'll kind of just be working out
[02:44:06.220 --> 02:44:08.460]  those who are operating, those who are not operating
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:11.820]  and getting all the boxes checked on the application
[02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:14.340]  to make it as seamless as possible.
[02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:16.260]  So once again, thank you to Cornell
[02:44:16.260 --> 02:44:18.900]  for letting us give this update.
[02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:20.940]  If you wanna contact us,
[02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:23.340]  we're more than happy to answer questions.
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:28.220]  The email is hempathealth.newyork.gov.
[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:29.940]  And thank you.
[02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:31.620]  I will kick it back to Larry now.
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:35.820]  Thanks very much, Pat.
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:39.940]  We're very close to the scheduled time
[02:44:39.940 --> 02:44:41.180]  of completing our field day,
[02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:44.420]  but I wanna go another 15 minutes or so
[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:47.500]  to try to let mainly you and Chris
[02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:50.180]  answer some of these questions if you can.
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:54.100]  One of the main questions I've seen is
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:59.020]  how will USDA define a grower or producer?
[02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:02.500]  Is that the landowner or would it be
[02:45:04.580 --> 02:45:06.740]  someone who's renting the land, for example?
[02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:08.620]  Chris, do you have an idea?
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:10.580]  I'm not sure I can answer that.
[02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:13.340]  So Larry, I think my sense is that
[02:45:13.340 --> 02:45:17.100]  it's going to be very similar to how we defined it.
[02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:19.700]  And again, these are all details
[02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:24.100]  that we need to work through with them.
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:29.100]  But my sense is it's the farmer is registered with them
[02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:33.300]  and then the locations get registered
[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:35.780]  through Farm Service Agency.
[02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:36.620]  Yeah.
[02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:40.500]  Dan is asking who needs to have
[02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:45.140]  the FBI identity history summary.
[02:45:45.140 --> 02:45:46.740]  My reading of that was it was
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:49.260]  the principals of the firm, right?
[02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:50.740]  I would agree with that, yep.
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:57.060]  So not necessarily all of the staff or investors.
[02:45:57.060 --> 02:45:58.780]  And of course at Cornell University,
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:01.580]  we're in discussion with our general counsel
[02:46:01.580 --> 02:46:03.860]  because the principal of Cornell University
[02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:06.420]  is our president and our board of trustees.
[02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:09.420]  Yep, I think we crossed that bridge ourselves
[02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:10.820]  on that a while ago, right?
[02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:12.620]  Between the state and Cornell.
[02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:17.620]  I just got an email from our general counsel saying,
[02:46:17.620 --> 02:46:20.300]  Larry, you're going to apply as an individual, right?
[02:46:20.300 --> 02:46:21.300]  Ha ha ha ha.
[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:28.860]  Another question that has come up quite a bit from Pat
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:30.580]  and we get this question quite a bit
[02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:35.580]  is will Department of Health be regulating smokable flour?
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:39.180]  What will the regulation of that look like
[02:46:39.180 --> 02:46:40.660]  under the DOH program?
[02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:43.860]  Yeah, so I will make the caveat
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:46.660]  that our regulations are not final yet.
[02:46:46.660 --> 02:46:48.060]  So this is all subject to change.
[02:46:48.060 --> 02:46:49.140]  And even when they're posted,
[02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:51.060]  they're still subject to change.
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:53.620]  But at the time we are looking for a pathway
[02:46:53.620 --> 02:46:54.900]  to allow flour.
[02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:59.780]  However, we are going to restrict the forms
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:00.620]  that can be sold.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:04.540]  So no pre-rolls, no hemp cigars, no cigarettes.
[02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:07.060]  And that's really done from a public health perspective
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:10.220]  to not really encourage the combustion of these products.
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:13.020]  And then recognizing that they are available
[02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:14.780]  in other states and online.
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:19.100]  And there's also other uses such as hemp teas
[02:47:19.100 --> 02:47:20.900]  and throwing them in flour
[02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:22.500]  or making your own edibles at home.
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:26.220]  So at this time, that is the direction we're heading.
[02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:29.380]  But please be on the lookout for those final regulations.
[02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:33.860]  Another question, I think for Chris,
[02:47:33.860 --> 02:47:38.060]  although maybe not a Division of Plant Industry question.
[02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:41.300]  Can we extend our New York grown and certified status
[02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:44.180]  to our hemp crop and cannabinoid products?
[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:48.700]  So not a plant industry question, Larry.
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:52.700]  I would have to kick that to one of our folks
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:56.100]  in Ag Development and certainly can try
[02:47:56.100 --> 02:47:57.740]  to get an answer to that for you.
[02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:04.980]  I think I've seen questions regarding holding material
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:08.380]  after November 1st.
[02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:12.220]  So will you need to be licensed with USDA
[02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:16.020]  to hold, let's say dried hemp material?
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:19.900]  Certainly if you have clones growing in your greenhouse
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:23.020]  on November 1st, as we will have,
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:24.900]  we need to have a USDA license.
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:29.580]  But what about tested harvested material?
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:34.220]  So we've actually, as we've been kind of participating
[02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:35.740]  in this webinar today,
[02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:40.740]  we've been having some side conversations with USDA
[02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:42.340]  with some of those questions.
[02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:45.860]  And we're gonna try to get a firm answer on that.
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:49.260]  The initial answer we have on that is,
[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:53.420]  is that anything that is out of the ground,
[02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:57.780]  harvested, tested before October 31st
[02:48:57.780 --> 02:49:01.860]  should be to the state standard.
[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:05.300]  Anything that is still in the ground
[02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:08.700]  and the testing and such is not completed
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:12.300]  by October 31st goes to the federal standard.
[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:14.260]  I think one of the things that we really need
[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:17.100]  to get a bead on, Larry, is,
[02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:19.020]  I know there's some product out there
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:22.540]  that has been stored for a longer period of time
[02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:25.460]  that folks are waiting frankly
[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:27.540]  for a better market conditions.
[02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:29.180]  And we need to get a sense of that
[02:49:29.180 --> 02:49:33.460]  because I'm not sure, well,
[02:49:33.460 --> 02:49:36.220]  I know that our former staff person
[02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:38.580]  who now works for USDA understands
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:41.340]  that I'm not sure people higher up the chain
[02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:43.980]  in USDA have a sense of that.
[02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:46.020]  So we can work on that one.
[02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:46.860]  Yeah.
[02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:49.780]  Pat, there's a question.
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:53.140]  Can you talk about the application process for retailers?
[02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:55.340]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:49:55.340 --> 02:49:57.060]  So we're actually, we're in the process now
[02:49:57.580 --> 02:50:00.260]  of developing an online application for that,
[02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:02.540]  trying to make it kind of as easy as possible.
[02:50:02.540 --> 02:50:05.820]  It's not meant to be really a barrier of entry
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:09.500]  and it's really more of a permit or registration
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:12.820]  at which you can kind of just get an idea
[02:50:12.820 --> 02:50:14.940]  of where these places are being sold
[02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:19.100]  and then can provide some education to them.
[02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:20.940]  And similar to the processor licenses,
[02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:23.500]  we're hoping to roll that out in early 2021.
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:25.820]  Great.
[02:50:29.340 --> 02:50:30.460]  There's a question.
[02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:33.180]  What will the mechanism of enforcement be
[02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:37.020]  for non-compliant hemp products in New York state
[02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:38.300]  beginning in 21?
[02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:42.020]  That's a question for you, Pat.
[02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:47.020]  How is DOH going to enforce all of these new regulations?
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:49.020]  That's a great question.
[02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:52.060]  And we are definitely working through that now right here.
[02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:54.460]  Like I said, I think the first year
[02:50:54.460 --> 02:50:56.340]  will really be focused on education
[02:50:56.460 --> 02:50:58.700]  and trying to get people understanding
[02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:00.780]  what the new rules and regulations are.
[02:51:00.780 --> 02:51:03.700]  We understand that a lot of these people have products
[02:51:03.700 --> 02:51:05.940]  that they've already purchased in anticipation
[02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:07.420]  for the next six months.
[02:51:07.420 --> 02:51:10.540]  So there will be some type of grace period there
[02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:12.340]  for stuff that's on the shelves now.
[02:51:13.180 --> 02:51:15.260]  And then from there, I think it's,
[02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:17.780]  we're gonna take best practices from Ag and Markets
[02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:19.780]  and what we learned in the medical marijuana industry
[02:51:19.780 --> 02:51:24.500]  in terms of testing products, doing random sampling,
[02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:25.860]  secret shopping, stuff like that
[02:51:25.860 --> 02:51:29.180]  to kind of make sure that things are properly labeled
[02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:30.020]  and manufactured.
[02:51:30.980 --> 02:51:32.420]  Yeah.
[02:51:32.420 --> 02:51:34.060]  There have been a lot of comments
[02:51:34.060 --> 02:51:39.060]  about the federal limits or compliance limits for THC.
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:44.820]  Folks should know that the National Farm Bureau Federation
[02:51:44.820 --> 02:51:49.820]  is lobbying Congress for a 1% total THC limit,
[02:51:50.860 --> 02:51:54.060]  as well as many of the hemp industry groups.
[02:51:54.620 --> 02:51:57.380]  So if you are not a member of Hemp Industry Association
[02:51:57.380 --> 02:52:02.100]  or other national hemp associations,
[02:52:03.060 --> 02:52:06.740]  now may be a good time to consider joining some of those
[02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:11.620]  because they are involved in that advocacy.
[02:52:15.060 --> 02:52:17.500]  There was a question, Chris,
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:20.980]  if folks are only one year into their license,
[02:52:20.980 --> 02:52:22.660]  will they get a refund?
[02:52:23.660 --> 02:52:26.740]  So that's a great question, Larry.
[02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:30.980]  Unfortunately, that's an application fee
[02:52:30.980 --> 02:52:32.620]  that we had with this program
[02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:35.140]  and we are not gonna be in the position
[02:52:35.140 --> 02:52:37.700]  to prorate those licenses.
[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:41.580]  So question for Pat,
[02:52:41.580 --> 02:52:44.060]  will existing research partner processors
[02:52:44.060 --> 02:52:47.380]  be grandfathered into the DOH program?
[02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:52.060]  What would be the transition for existing license holders?
[02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:55.660]  Yeah, so we actually started the outreach
[02:52:55.660 --> 02:52:58.500]  about a month ago to kind of do a level set
[02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:00.460]  and we're working with Ag and Markets now
[02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:02.580]  to kind of get a good snapshot
[02:53:02.580 --> 02:53:04.300]  of kind of where everyone is in the process.
[02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:07.140]  We understand that COVID really threw a wrench
[02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:09.220]  into a lot of people setting up their facilities
[02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:11.260]  and getting all their extraction equipment ready
[02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:12.540]  and stuff like that.
[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:15.060]  So our goal here at DOH is really to work
[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:16.420]  with all the research partners
[02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:19.220]  to help them transition as seamless as possible.
[02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:23.540]  Everyone will have to apply under a new license
[02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:25.060]  because it is a new program,
[02:53:25.060 --> 02:53:27.620]  but we're hoping to really spell that out
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:31.380]  and make it as easy as possible to kind of shift over.
[02:53:31.380 --> 02:53:34.380]  So people who are in operation can continue
[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:35.700]  and those who are still setting up
[02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:37.260]  will understand the new requirements
[02:53:37.260 --> 02:53:38.820]  and can hit the ground running.
[02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:42.620]  Yeah, I think there's a similar question
[02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:45.580]  for folks who will need to transition
[02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:47.860]  from the state program to the federal program.
[02:53:47.860 --> 02:53:49.420]  When should they start?
[02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:52.300]  We've got just a little bit more than two months now.
[02:53:53.420 --> 02:53:56.780]  I started filling out my application this morning
[02:53:56.780 --> 02:54:01.300]  and looking at the FBI identity history summary check,
[02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:04.100]  there is a big notice here on the website
[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:07.700]  that if you submit that via mail,
[02:54:07.700 --> 02:54:10.500]  the current processing time is 12 weeks.
[02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:13.620]  There is an online process
[02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:16.820]  that they say will only take four to five days,
[02:54:17.700 --> 02:54:20.460]  but if you are currently a grower
[02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:23.380]  and will need a grower's license on November 1st,
[02:54:23.380 --> 02:54:28.380]  I would encourage you to get that paperwork in quickly.
[02:54:28.380 --> 02:54:31.540]  So, and Larry, if I can jump in here real quick on that,
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:35.660]  because I see those questions in the chat as well.
[02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:41.260]  We're in conversations with USDA on how best to do this.
[02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:46.260]  And there could be a scenario
[02:54:46.300 --> 02:54:50.340]  where they hold applications
[02:54:51.580 --> 02:54:55.780]  and then, you know, if they were holding them,
[02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:58.140]  in other words, if they got my application today,
[02:54:58.140 --> 02:54:59.740]  they would take a look at it.
[02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:02.900]  They would determine whether it was complete or not.
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:04.820]  If it was incomplete, they'd return it.
[02:55:04.820 --> 02:55:06.940]  They would then perhaps hold it
[02:55:06.940 --> 02:55:11.140]  until the end of October, issue the registration.
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:14.380]  With a couple of other states that frankly
[02:55:14.940 --> 02:55:19.380]  are bigger in hemp production than New York
[02:55:19.380 --> 02:55:24.140]  on the cusp of making similar decisions that we made,
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:26.860]  they're thinking that they don't wanna get backed up.
[02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:30.940]  And what they may do is to, you know,
[02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:33.620]  start accepting those applications,
[02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:36.860]  acting on them and actually issuing the license document
[02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:39.340]  with a November 1st effective date.
[02:55:39.340 --> 02:55:43.860]  So what I would ask is that folks
[02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:47.620]  allow us to have a little bit more conversation with USDA
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:50.700]  and see how they want to handle this.
[02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:56.660]  You know, as a administrator who faced the tidal wave
[02:55:56.860 --> 02:56:01.860]  of 2017 and 2018, you know,
[02:56:02.060 --> 02:56:05.860]  I still wanna maintain a respectful
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:09.020]  and collegial relationship with USDA,
[02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:11.260]  particularly since, you know,
[02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:13.340]  one of their key staff people worked for me
[02:56:13.860 --> 02:56:16.300]  and I have a lot of respect for her personally as well.
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:19.620]  So let us work this a little bit.
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:24.740]  I don't see the answers to these types of questions
[02:56:25.620 --> 02:56:29.940]  as far as timing of applications taking particularly long.
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:32.660]  And so if we had even a week or so
[02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:33.980]  to kind of work through that
[02:56:33.980 --> 02:56:36.620]  and then get that information up on our website
[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:39.740]  as well as being able to distribute it through your lists,
[02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:41.420]  I think that would be super.
[02:56:42.380 --> 02:56:45.980]  Yeah, I will say that at a recent national conference,
[02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:48.260]  I was involved in Bill Hoffman
[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:50.860]  who was running the USDA program.
[02:56:52.620 --> 02:56:54.620]  I would say it was conflicted
[02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:58.700]  because he wants to serve the interest of the farmers,
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:02.820]  but is bound by the rulemaking process at USDA.
[02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:08.660]  So I hope they will maintain that attitude
[02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:12.140]  of keeping the interest of farmers.
[02:57:12.140 --> 02:57:17.140]  I have to say, despite our clear policy differences here,
[02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:24.020]  Bill seems to be a very thoughtful person
[02:57:25.380 --> 02:57:28.940]  and I think really wants to see this industry grow.
[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:32.420]  And I think he can be a strong advocate for it.
[02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:37.420]  But again, I've compared his situation
[02:57:39.020 --> 02:57:44.020]  to where we were in the state in 2015 and 2016
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:46.740]  when we put our first reg in place,
[02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:49.460]  which if you remember had the requirements
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:51.620]  for the security fences
[02:57:51.620 --> 02:57:55.420]  and was gonna cost everybody 50, $60,000 an acre
[02:57:55.420 --> 02:57:56.260]  to comply with.
[02:57:56.260 --> 02:57:59.620]  Give them some time to work through this.
[02:58:01.420 --> 02:58:05.060]  Just a couple of final notes here in the regulations,
[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:08.220]  there is an application window to USDA.
[02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:12.820]  That would close on October 31st.
[02:58:12.820 --> 02:58:15.920]  So again, get going on your application.
[02:58:18.260 --> 02:58:23.260]  And there's a comment here that the FBI check
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:24.980]  did come back quickly.
[02:58:24.980 --> 02:58:27.040]  I think that's if you do it online.
[02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:31.380]  Any final comments, Pat or Chris,
[02:58:31.380 --> 02:58:33.300]  because we're gonna wrap this up here.
[02:58:33.900 --> 02:58:38.900]  Just that excited to keep the dialogue going,
[02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:42.740]  please email us there.
[02:58:42.740 --> 02:58:44.420]  We're happy to work together on this
[02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:46.940]  and make the best program we can.
[02:58:46.940 --> 02:58:47.780]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:58:49.260 --> 02:58:51.380]  Yeah, Larry, thanks for the opportunity today.
[02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:53.580]  And I appreciate the thoughtful questions
[02:58:53.580 --> 02:58:56.900]  from the participants as well as again,
[02:58:56.900 --> 02:59:01.060]  how respectful everybody has been of our staff here
[02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:03.260]  in Albany, as well as the folks we've got out working
[02:59:04.100 --> 02:59:05.740]  in the field, appreciate it.
[02:59:05.740 --> 02:59:08.940]  Yep, thanks very much to you, Chris and to Pat,
[02:59:08.940 --> 02:59:12.680]  as well as to our other panelists, John, Lindsay and Mary.
[02:59:13.740 --> 02:59:16.420]  Again, when you have questions,
[02:59:16.420 --> 02:59:17.940]  they're your first point of contact,
[02:59:17.940 --> 02:59:20.820]  Cornell Cooperative Extension, they're very knowledgeable.
[02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:23.420]  I've been building the knowledge base in New York State
[02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:25.380]  for three years now.
[02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:29.240]  So I really wanna thank everyone for joining us.
[02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:32.880]  We hit about 270 attendees at the peak.
[02:59:33.720 --> 02:59:38.480]  So we had pretty broad impact nationally as well.
[02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:42.320]  So I wanna thank again, all of our speakers and panelists
[02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:44.600]  and thank you for attending.
[02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:49.000]  We look forward to hopefully an in-person
[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:53.860]  or a hybrid in-person and online field day in 2021.
[02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:56.640]  Thanks very much, everyone.
[02:59:56.640 --> 02:59:58.280]  Thank you, Larry.
[02:59:58.280 --> 02:59:59.120]  Well done.
[03:00:06.920 --> 03:00:10.400]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:13.240]  on the web at cornell.edu.
