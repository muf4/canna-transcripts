[00:00.510 --> 00:04.470]  Good morning, my name is Marion Zuffole and I work for the New York State
[00:04.470 --> 00:08.910]  Integrated Pest Management Program. Today I'm going to talk to you about insect
[00:08.910 --> 00:13.910]  pests or potential insect pests of hemp and their management. This was my first
[00:13.910 --> 00:17.990]  summer working in hemp and I've really enjoyed the experience. So my goal this
[00:17.990 --> 00:22.870]  summer was to just go out there and learn as much as I can about hemp, try
[00:22.870 --> 00:26.910]  to identify any insects and diseases that are out there. So today I'm going
[00:26.910 --> 00:29.670]  to specifically just talk about the insect pests. We've already heard about
[00:29.670 --> 00:33.150]  some of the diseases out there and so I'm just going to focus in on what
[00:33.150 --> 00:39.270]  insects I found. Before I get started I first just wanted to stress the
[00:39.270 --> 00:42.390]  importance of scouting and identification because not everything
[00:42.390 --> 00:46.470]  that's out there is a pest. In fact very few insects to date have caused enough
[00:46.470 --> 00:51.390]  damage to impact hemp and this crop is still relatively new so we don't have a
[00:51.390 --> 00:55.750]  lot of thresholds for any insect pests that we do find. So for this reason it's
[00:55.750 --> 00:59.910]  very important for you to go out, scout your hemp fields regularly and that way
[00:59.910 --> 01:03.450]  you can notice any potential problems and keep an eye on them. So what I did
[01:03.450 --> 01:07.790]  this summer was I scouted nine different hemp fields weekly as well as one high
[01:07.790 --> 01:12.230]  tunnel and I also set up European corn borer tracks which you can see here in
[01:12.230 --> 01:16.150]  the picture next to hemp field so I can monitor the flight of European corn
[01:16.150 --> 01:20.650]  borer which is one of the known pests, potential pests of hemp. Again not
[01:20.650 --> 01:24.150]  everything is a pest so we have to be able to identify what's a pest, what's a
[01:24.150 --> 01:28.110]  beneficial and what's an incidental, an insect that just happens to be out in
[01:28.110 --> 01:32.390]  the field but isn't causing any damage. So now I'm going to go over some of the
[01:32.390 --> 01:37.050]  insects that I did find this season. The first one that I encountered was early
[01:37.050 --> 01:40.470]  in the season while the plants were still in the greenhouse. The grower came
[01:40.470 --> 01:43.790]  to me and he informed me that hundreds of the seedlings were dying and you can
[01:43.790 --> 01:48.150]  see that from the top upper right hand corner. The seedlings were turning yellow
[01:48.150 --> 01:51.510]  and were dying and he wasn't quite sure what was causing it and we noticed that
[01:51.590 --> 01:55.830]  he had a lot of fungus gnats and he also had fusarium and we determined that it
[01:55.830 --> 01:59.030]  was fusarium. We took some seedlings and sent them to Chris Smart and she
[01:59.030 --> 02:03.790]  identified fusarium in the seedlings. So the fungus gnats, they are tiny little
[02:03.790 --> 02:08.590]  flies that lay their eggs in wet soil near the base of the plants. The larvae
[02:08.590 --> 02:12.190]  will hatch out of the eggs and then they start feeding on decaying matter but they
[02:12.190 --> 02:16.630]  will also feed on roots and both the adult fungus gnats as well as the larvae
[02:16.630 --> 02:20.950]  can transmit diseases such as fusarium. So what the grower did is he changed out
[02:20.950 --> 02:24.830]  his potting media and then he also decreased his watering. He was over
[02:24.830 --> 02:27.870]  watering his plants and you're supposed to really let them dry out between
[02:27.870 --> 02:32.230]  waterings. Let the top layer dry out between waterings and that really helped
[02:32.230 --> 02:37.510]  his fungus gnat problem and he also introduced nematodes. So one thing you
[02:37.510 --> 02:40.590]  can do to monitor for fungus gnats is you can place yellow sticky cards in
[02:40.590 --> 02:45.110]  your greenhouse so that you can detect them early. If you do have fungus gnats
[02:45.110 --> 02:49.790]  you should allow that top layer of soil to dry out completely. This will kill
[02:49.830 --> 02:54.670]  both the fungus as well as which the gnats feed on as well as the fungus gnat
[02:54.670 --> 03:03.680]  larvae. So really let that soil dry out between waterings. This is the two-spotted
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.800]  spider mite. These are small little mites found on the underside of leaves and
[03:07.800 --> 03:10.560]  they cause this stippling appearance that you can see in both of the pictures
[03:10.560 --> 03:13.640]  kind of on the upper surface of the leaves. You usually notice the stippling
[03:13.640 --> 03:18.080]  first and then if you turn the leaf over you'll find the spider mites. These I
[03:18.080 --> 03:22.880]  found in the high tunnel as well as in the field and both of them both in the
[03:22.880 --> 03:26.000]  high tunnel as well as in the field the numbers stayed fairly low. The high
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.360]  tunnel has since been harvested and no control measures were needed and the
[03:30.360 --> 03:34.040]  populations in the field have never increased. I monitor it weekly and the
[03:34.040 --> 03:37.960]  numbers have stayed very very low. Two-spotted spider mites do prefer very
[03:37.960 --> 03:41.860]  hot dry weather so one of the ways to manage for them is to make sure that
[03:41.860 --> 03:46.400]  your plants aren't water stressed. You can also remove any potential weed hosts
[03:46.440 --> 03:51.120]  that are surrounding your field and then if you do have a spider mite problem or
[03:51.120 --> 03:54.800]  you know that you will you can release predatory mites to control the spider
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.320]  mite population. But if you do do this you have to do it in advance of the
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.320]  spider mites becoming out of control. So as soon as you have that first sign of
[04:03.320 --> 04:08.040]  two-spotted spider mites you want to release your beneficial predatory mites.
[04:08.040 --> 04:12.040]  This is the red-headed flea beetle which was probably the most numerous insect
[04:12.040 --> 04:15.600]  that I observed this summer. The adults are fairly large three to six
[04:15.600 --> 04:20.000]  millimeters and have a reddish brown head and a shiny black body. They feed
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.080]  on the leaves between the veins and cause these holes all over the
[04:25.080 --> 04:28.840]  leaves. Even though they were very numerous and I saw quite a bit of damage
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.280]  all the plants grew out of it and the young seedlings are the ones that are
[04:32.280 --> 04:36.880]  most at risk from flea beetle damage. So some of the control measures you can do
[04:36.880 --> 04:40.080]  is you can protect your young seedlings with row cover until they're large
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.400]  enough to withstand the feeding pressure. You can also plow in the to decrease the
[04:45.440 --> 04:49.320]  overwintering population and then you can use beneficial nematodes which will
[04:49.320 --> 04:56.120]  control the larvae in the soil. I also found some aphids. These are small
[04:56.120 --> 05:00.320]  sap-sucking insects kind of pear-shaped. They're found on the underside of the
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.240]  leaves but they can also be found near the stem or in the flowers. There are
[05:04.240 --> 05:08.880]  several different species of aphids that are known to occur on hemp. Of the nine
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.400]  fields that I was scouting only one of them did I find aphids in and they
[05:13.400 --> 05:17.960]  remained on the lower leaves and there was a lot of beneficials including lady
[05:17.960 --> 05:21.840]  bugs and minute pirate bugs and lacewings that really kept the population
[05:21.840 --> 05:26.460]  under control. They are still out there and I'm still monitoring them weekly to
[05:26.460 --> 05:30.680]  make sure that the population doesn't get any bigger. I did take a sample and I
[05:30.680 --> 05:35.120]  sent it to the Cornell insect diagnostic lab for identification because I don't
[05:35.120 --> 05:42.080]  know what species it is but I only found the one in one field. There are a few
[05:42.080 --> 05:46.040]  different insects that will bore into the stem of hemp including the common
[05:46.040 --> 05:49.720]  stalk borer which is pictured here as well as European corn borer and the hemp
[05:49.720 --> 05:53.600]  borer. The only one that I found this season was the common stalk borer. I've
[05:53.600 --> 05:57.200]  not found the other ones. I did set up traps for European corn borer but the
[05:57.200 --> 06:01.160]  numbers were very very low and I never found any in the plant. So here's a
[06:01.160 --> 06:06.840]  picture of a larvae inside a hemp stalk. They are brown with these long white
[06:06.840 --> 06:11.800]  lines that run the length of the body. The female will lay her eggs in grasses
[06:11.800 --> 06:15.320]  and weeds kind of around the edge of a field and when they hatch, when the
[06:15.320 --> 06:18.560]  larvae hatch, they will move into the field looking for a suitable plant to
[06:18.560 --> 06:22.280]  bore into. So one of the management options is to control your weeds and
[06:22.280 --> 06:26.320]  grasses in the surrounding fields. Usually if you do have stalk borer it's
[06:26.320 --> 06:30.360]  going to be on the edge of fields where you're going to find the damage. Another
[06:30.360 --> 06:34.960]  option is to plant your plants early so that they're large enough that when the
[06:34.960 --> 06:40.320]  larvae move in they can withstand some of that boring damage. Chemical control
[06:40.360 --> 06:44.280]  options are limited because once they're inside the stem they're protected from
[06:44.280 --> 06:48.960]  any kind of chemical control. This is the last insect that I'm going to talk about,
[06:48.960 --> 06:52.960]  the yellow woolly bear caterpillar. This is a caterpillar that feeds on many
[06:52.960 --> 06:58.000]  different plants including hemp. It's covered in dense yellow hairs over its
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.920]  entire body and this one I found in the high tunnel that I was scouting. And
[07:01.920 --> 07:05.840]  usually it doesn't cause a problem. The female lays about 50 eggs on a host
[07:05.840 --> 07:09.800]  plant and the caterpillars they feed together for a little while but then
[07:09.800 --> 07:13.400]  they disperse throughout the field and just cause a little bit of damage to
[07:13.400 --> 07:17.440]  individual plants. But because this was in a high tunnel they were all
[07:17.440 --> 07:21.800]  concentrated in one area and they couldn't disperse. It caused much more
[07:21.800 --> 07:25.160]  significant damage. So when I was in there scouting I noticed a lot of the
[07:25.160 --> 07:29.600]  plants, the lower third of the plant was completely defoliated. So I notified the
[07:29.600 --> 07:33.360]  grower about that and what we ended up doing he just went in and hand-picked
[07:33.360 --> 07:36.720]  them all. There's probably about a hundred or so in the high tunnel but he
[07:36.720 --> 07:40.160]  couldn't control them since it wasn't a defined area. He could just go in and
[07:40.160 --> 07:44.800]  hand-pick them all to remove them. It didn't really cause any serious damage
[07:44.800 --> 07:49.840]  because we were able to get rid of them. So here just real briefly is a list of
[07:49.840 --> 07:53.600]  some of the other insects that I found on hemp which includes the leaf miner
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.280]  which I'm attempting to rear out to determine what kind of what species it
[07:57.280 --> 08:02.160]  is, four-lined plant bug, various caterpillars, different grasshoppers,
[08:02.160 --> 08:07.220]  brown marmorated stink bug, leaf hoppers, tree hoppers, the oblique banded leaf
[08:07.220 --> 08:11.280]  roller I was able to rear that out, and the tarnished plant bug. So as you can
[08:11.280 --> 08:15.880]  see there's a lot of different insects that are found on hemp. Not all of them
[08:15.880 --> 08:19.360]  are pests so it's important to know what's a pest, what's an
[08:19.360 --> 08:22.520]  incidental, and of course as I mentioned before what are your beneficials so that
[08:22.520 --> 08:26.480]  you can just control the ones that you need to. So if there's any questions I
[08:26.480 --> 08:29.480]  will take those now.
