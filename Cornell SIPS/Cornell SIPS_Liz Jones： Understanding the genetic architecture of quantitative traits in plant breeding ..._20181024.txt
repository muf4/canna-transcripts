[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:03.000 --> 00:13.780]  Okay, so my talk today is about understanding the genetic architecture of quantitative traits
[00:13.780 --> 00:18.780]  and this endless quest that we have to try and understand quantitative traits and whether
[00:18.780 --> 00:22.780]  it's really fruitful in terms of plant breeding.
[00:22.780 --> 00:28.780]  And I'm going to build, as Susan said, on some of my experiences in my PhD and my postdocs
[00:28.780 --> 00:34.780]  and also my time in industry and finish off with telling you something about the GoBeat project.
[00:34.780 --> 00:39.780]  So my PhD, I was incredibly lucky.
[00:39.780 --> 00:41.780]  I had a perfect project.
[00:41.780 --> 00:44.780]  I got to work on pearl millet down in Mildew in India.
[00:44.780 --> 00:47.780]  And pearl millet is just an incredible crop.
[00:47.780 --> 00:53.780]  It has these beautiful long panicles laden with pearl-shaped seeds.
[00:53.780 --> 00:59.780]  And it can be, the seeds can be ground, made into a flour or a porridge, made into a beer
[00:59.780 --> 01:01.780]  or popped like popcorn.
[01:01.780 --> 01:02.780]  It's very versatile.
[01:02.780 --> 01:05.780]  It also has a higher nutrient content than rice or wheat.
[01:05.780 --> 01:09.780]  So it's really a very valuable crop.
[01:09.780 --> 01:14.780]  Most importantly, it can grow in the hot, sandy soils.
[01:14.780 --> 01:20.780]  High pHs, low nutrient content, it can withstand long periods of no rainfall and then when
[01:20.780 --> 01:22.780]  it rains, recover very rapidly.
[01:23.780 --> 01:25.780]  So it's really an amazing crop.
[01:25.780 --> 01:29.780]  And it was also a success, the Green Revolution.
[01:29.780 --> 01:35.780]  There were two male sterile lines produced in Tipton, Georgia in the U.S.
[01:35.780 --> 01:38.780]  And with those, they started to produce hybrids.
[01:38.780 --> 01:44.780]  And those hybrids were very successful and were widely accepted and were spread all over India
[01:44.780 --> 01:51.780]  when the first of several major epidemics, family mildew major epidemics occurred,
[01:51.780 --> 01:57.780]  causing a massive loss in yield from 13 to 3 million metric tons in a single year.
[01:57.780 --> 02:04.780]  So the disease is caused by a pathogen called Sclerospora graminicola.
[02:04.780 --> 02:07.780]  It's an oomycete, an obligate biotroph.
[02:07.780 --> 02:10.780]  And resistance is quantitative.
[02:10.780 --> 02:14.780]  So you see a continuous distribution when you screen for resistance.
[02:14.780 --> 02:16.780]  But it's also environmentally variable.
[02:16.780 --> 02:22.780]  So there's obviously some either environmental differences or pathogen population differences.
[02:22.780 --> 02:25.780]  Very little was known about the disease then.
[02:25.780 --> 02:32.780]  Very few single zoospore isolates and no differentials have been characterized.
[02:32.780 --> 02:35.780]  But it's a really amazing pathogen.
[02:37.780 --> 02:44.780]  Instead of growing into the leaf and forming a local lesion, what it actually does is it
[02:44.780 --> 02:51.780]  grows down to the growing point of the plant and it will infect undifferentiated tissue.
[02:51.780 --> 02:58.780]  What you actually see for these half leaves, this was the part of the leaf that was undifferentiated
[02:58.780 --> 03:01.780]  at the time of infection, and this part was differentiated.
[03:01.780 --> 03:07.780]  So you get these half leaf symptoms showing infection, which is very typical of the disease.
[03:07.780 --> 03:13.780]  And in earlier stages of infection, you get this really wild panicle.
[03:13.780 --> 03:19.780]  So this panicle is being transformed from that beautiful long panicle to this phyloidly leafy tissue.
[03:19.780 --> 03:23.780]  So it's really the forks and chips following pathogen infection.
[03:26.780 --> 03:30.780]  So my project was to map QTLs for resistance to pearl millet.
[03:30.780 --> 03:35.780]  And because of quarantine restrictions, they couldn't take pathogens from parts of Africa
[03:35.780 --> 03:39.780]  and parts of India and move them to another location to do trials.
[03:39.780 --> 03:44.780]  They were very strictly not allowed to move any of those disease plants.
[03:44.780 --> 03:47.780]  And my supervisor was in India at the time.
[03:47.780 --> 03:53.780]  He was working at ICRASAT, which is the International Crocs Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics.
[03:54.780 --> 03:56.780]  That's where they were working on pearl millet.
[03:56.780 --> 03:59.780]  He wanted to settle back down in the UK.
[03:59.780 --> 04:05.780]  So he decided to bring all those pathogen populations back to the UK and do the screening there.
[04:05.780 --> 04:10.780]  Which was a little crazy because the place he chose in the UK was North Wales,
[04:10.780 --> 04:13.780]  which is the rainiest place in the UK.
[04:14.780 --> 04:20.780]  If you think Seattle is rainy, it's like three or four times the rainfall of Seattle.
[04:21.780 --> 04:23.780]  One of the rainiest places in the world.
[04:23.780 --> 04:27.780]  But surprisingly, pearl millet liked it. It grew pretty well.
[04:27.780 --> 04:34.780]  That's me doing Danumeldu screens in Bangor in Wales in the UK.
[04:34.780 --> 04:40.780]  And we also replicated the screens in India and in Newcastle and Biltong.
[04:42.780 --> 04:47.780]  And so, to cut a long story short, this was the essence of the results.
[04:48.780 --> 04:50.780]  Pearl millet has seven linkage groups.
[04:50.780 --> 04:53.780]  And each of these graphs is a separate linkage group.
[04:53.780 --> 04:59.780]  And with the different color lines showing QTLs to each of the different pathogen populations.
[05:00.780 --> 05:06.780]  The y-axis is the log of the odds ratio, LOD score, with a threshold of about two.
[05:06.780 --> 05:10.780]  And so the first thing you see are these huge, enormous QTLs.
[05:10.780 --> 05:14.780]  Every pathogen population had a QTL major effect.
[05:14.780 --> 05:20.780]  And also some QTLs of minor effect, like you see on linkage groups six and seven.
[05:20.780 --> 05:26.780]  And the amazing thing was those QTLs were extremely stable over repeated screens,
[05:26.780 --> 05:29.780]  with different disease pressures in the fields of the greenhouse.
[05:29.780 --> 05:32.780]  Exactly the same, even the minor ones.
[05:32.780 --> 05:39.780]  And I did carry on to try and isolate single ZOOS4 isolates from the pathogen populations.
[05:39.780 --> 05:41.780]  And found even more QTLs.
[05:41.780 --> 05:46.780]  Every time we tried a new pathogen population, more QTLs would pop up.
[05:46.780 --> 05:50.780]  So a huge amount of avirulence is in pathogen population.
[05:50.780 --> 05:54.780]  And a huge amount of resistance in pearl millet materials.
[05:56.780 --> 05:59.780]  So this was a real success story.
[05:59.780 --> 06:06.780]  There was a very popular hybrid called HHB67, which was susceptible to disease.
[06:06.780 --> 06:14.780]  And by integrating one of these danymildi resistances into HHB67, we could make it resistant.
[06:15.780 --> 06:20.780]  Now, how long in that kind of environment can you have a resistance last?
[06:20.780 --> 06:22.780]  Probably two to three years.
[06:22.780 --> 06:25.780]  And the pearl millet breeders have actually been very clever.
[06:25.780 --> 06:30.780]  They've diversified their parental materials that are going into hybrids.
[06:30.780 --> 06:35.780]  They've integrated new resistance genes over time, and they've stacked resistance genes.
[06:35.780 --> 06:43.780]  And so in this very diverse host pathogen environment, where easily they could have had
[06:43.780 --> 06:50.780]  bust after bust and just continuous epidemics, they've managed to keep increasing yields over time.
[06:51.780 --> 06:54.780]  So a great success story, QTL mapping.
[06:57.780 --> 07:10.780]  But then, this is what I find is more typically the case, is the project I worked on with late blight resistance in tomato.
[07:11.780 --> 07:14.780]  The late blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans.
[07:14.780 --> 07:17.780]  It's a very serious disease of potato and tomato.
[07:17.780 --> 07:24.780]  And it's best known for causing the Irish potato famine of the 1800s, which caused mass starvation and immigration.
[07:25.780 --> 07:31.780]  Resistance lasts two to three years in potato, so they tend to look for general resistance.
[07:32.780 --> 07:35.780]  So many, many QTLs of small effect.
[07:35.780 --> 07:38.780]  And so that's what we tried to do in tomato too.
[07:39.780 --> 07:41.780]  So we were working with UC Riverside.
[07:41.780 --> 07:46.780]  This is a project at UC Davis with a pathologist called Mike Coffey.
[07:46.780 --> 07:54.780]  He'd found this wild tomato line that was resistant to over 100 isolates of Phytophthora infestans.
[07:56.780 --> 08:00.780]  And forgive me if I get the names wrong, because I've changed the names of the species for tomato.
[08:01.780 --> 08:07.780]  So what was Hasutum is now Hapocates, and what was Esculentum is now like Persicum.
[08:07.780 --> 08:14.780]  And so this shows side by side after inoculation, the wild species completely clean, no disease.
[08:14.780 --> 08:17.780]  And Esculentum is pretty much like a meltdown.
[08:19.780 --> 08:24.780]  So we did bidirectional back crosses and mapped QTLs in the bidirectional back crosses.
[08:26.780 --> 08:29.780]  And this was the results of this study.
[08:29.780 --> 08:33.780]  I'm just showing three of tomato's 12 chromosomes here.
[08:34.780 --> 08:38.780]  But what we saw were QTLs on every chromosome.
[08:38.780 --> 08:44.780]  Sometimes the QTLs would overlap, but the peaks are not necessarily distinct.
[08:44.780 --> 08:46.780]  The peaks are these little triangles here.
[08:47.780 --> 08:51.780]  This is Esculentum genetic map on the left and the Hasutum on the right.
[08:53.780 --> 08:59.780]  The more we screened, the more QTLs we found, the more confused we were with what we were going to do with this.
[09:00.780 --> 09:03.780]  And what we're finding is we are also mapping our potential traits.
[09:03.780 --> 09:10.780]  Not surprisingly, we're dealing with PC1 populations, which was probably a big mistake to be mapping in.
[09:11.780 --> 09:16.780]  But Esculentum, or like a Persicum, is this nice compact bushy plant.
[09:16.780 --> 09:21.780]  And Hasutum is this horrible, wieldy, rambling, indeterminate plant.
[09:22.780 --> 09:28.780]  So basically what we ended up mapping was a lot of QTLs for plant architecture and canopy.
[09:29.780 --> 09:35.780]  The more open the canopy is, the less disease, the less humid it is, and the less disease is built up.
[09:36.780 --> 09:44.780]  But we did, oh, this was one of the QTLs that I was particularly excited about, and I really wanted to see where this QTL went.
[09:45.780 --> 09:47.780]  It's a QTL for dispersal.
[09:47.780 --> 09:54.780]  So this is the cultivated parent, and you can just see the little droplet on the leaf after inoculation.
[09:55.780 --> 09:57.780]  This is also after inoculation.
[09:57.780 --> 10:00.780]  And the droplet just disappears.
[10:00.780 --> 10:02.780]  It's like magic, just disappears into the leaf.
[10:03.780 --> 10:08.780]  And that's thought to be due to the different trichome differences that the wild species have compared to Esculentum.
[10:09.780 --> 10:18.780]  And this is pretty exciting because trichome differences and the wax of the leaf has also been shown to have resistant properties to insects as well.
[10:20.780 --> 10:22.780]  So we definitely pursued this QTL.
[10:23.780 --> 10:26.780]  And this was the end result.
[10:26.780 --> 10:34.780]  And this is a lot to take in, but each of these mini blocks is basically a different line, a set of introgression lines.
[10:34.780 --> 10:37.780]  And so we're just showing four different QTLs here.
[10:38.780 --> 10:40.780]  And the QTLs are in red.
[10:41.780 --> 10:45.780]  And so, for example, this line has four QTLs in contrast to it.
[10:45.780 --> 10:46.780]  This one has none.
[10:46.780 --> 10:47.780]  It's uncontrolled.
[10:48.780 --> 10:50.780]  And it's between one and four of all the QTLs.
[10:51.780 --> 10:53.780]  It's a huge amount of work back then.
[10:54.780 --> 10:59.780]  You fill them with Caps markers, which are amplified, and then you restrict them and you run them out on the gel.
[10:59.780 --> 11:01.780]  So this was a massive amount of work.
[11:04.780 --> 11:14.780]  But what we saw when screening this material, that we just didn't have anything we could work with.
[11:15.780 --> 11:23.780]  QTL were all co-located with some QTL having a negative effect on the germ plasm.
[11:23.780 --> 11:29.780]  Such as plant height, shape, maturity, yield, and fruit size.
[11:29.780 --> 11:33.780]  None of these QTLs were usable in the plant breeding sense.
[11:34.780 --> 11:37.780]  And it was published, which is good.
[11:37.780 --> 11:39.780]  I mean, it's good to have negative results as well.
[11:40.780 --> 11:44.780]  But in terms of being productive for breeding, it had very limited use.
[11:49.780 --> 11:59.780]  So, I've had several of these projects where I was getting increasingly frustrated with being able to move QTLs into cultivated germ plasm.
[11:59.780 --> 12:01.780]  Being able to move them into breeding programs.
[12:02.780 --> 12:06.780]  And I was kind of sick of just collecting QTLs and never going anywhere.
[12:06.780 --> 12:10.780]  So I thought, I'm pretty sure industry has the answer.
[12:10.780 --> 12:13.780]  So I was recruited to industry.
[12:13.780 --> 12:15.780]  They have lots of money.
[12:15.780 --> 12:18.780]  They have systems in place to be able to do this.
[12:18.780 --> 12:23.780]  And I was sure I would be able to map QTLs there and move them into products.
[12:25.780 --> 12:27.780]  But again, I was disappointed.
[12:28.780 --> 12:34.780]  The issue that we had in industry, at least in the environment that I was working in, so maize and corn.
[12:34.780 --> 12:37.780]  I mean maize and soybean.
[12:37.780 --> 12:44.780]  Was that parents are extremely, cycled extremely fast through the breeding process.
[12:44.780 --> 12:47.780]  You cross your parents, you make your selections.
[12:47.780 --> 12:53.780]  You're constantly shifting that curve for yield and moving it towards higher yields.
[12:54.780 --> 13:00.780]  And as soon as you have those selections from the progeny, those become the new parents.
[13:00.780 --> 13:03.780]  You're never using old parents again and again.
[13:03.780 --> 13:06.780]  It's always new parents going into that breeding cycle.
[13:06.780 --> 13:09.780]  And that's how you make progress so quickly.
[13:11.780 --> 13:21.780]  And if you had a QTL, if you mapped a QTL, you really have to slow down this whole process to be able to integrate that QTL into one of the parents.
[13:21.780 --> 13:24.780]  You often have to do it by bridge back crossing.
[13:24.780 --> 13:26.780]  It's extremely expensive.
[13:26.780 --> 13:38.780]  And unless your QTL was of very high value, so basically a gene of major effect, it was just not valuable to the breeders to be able to fit it into the breeding cycle.
[13:38.780 --> 13:42.780]  And you remember they're also introgressing transgenes.
[13:42.780 --> 13:46.780]  So they're trying to manage herbicide resistance, multiple insect traits.
[13:46.780 --> 13:50.780]  QTLs just don't make it to the top of their list at all.
[13:52.780 --> 14:01.780]  And association mapping was, there were a couple of groups working on association mapping.
[14:01.780 --> 14:12.780]  Even less fruitful because most association mapping populations don't contain elite lines, don't contain lines of high relevance to breeding population.
[14:13.780 --> 14:20.780]  And so even if a QTL is found, it's really not going to make it into the normal breeding cycle.
[14:23.780 --> 14:32.780]  So the answer, and I've got one of Jean-Luc's papers up here, is to be able to map QTLs in the actual breeding populations.
[14:32.780 --> 14:34.780]  So you have your breeding populations.
[14:35.780 --> 14:44.780]  It might be small, but you can use pedigree information and you can use shared haplotypes to be able to map the QTLs as you're breeding.
[14:44.780 --> 14:48.780]  So you're not mapping QTLs in separate populations and then bringing the QTL.
[14:48.780 --> 14:51.780]  You're doing it actually in the breeding populations.
[14:51.780 --> 14:55.780]  And there was a second method.
[14:55.780 --> 14:59.780]  It was very popular in the soybean breeding program called breeding bias.
[14:59.780 --> 15:07.780]  And basically that just looked at the, very, very simple, looked at the alleles in ancestral populations and the alleles in elite populations.
[15:07.780 --> 15:12.780]  If there was an increase in frequency, breeders had selected from them.
[15:12.780 --> 15:14.780]  Breeders are good, so they must be good.
[15:14.780 --> 15:16.780]  And so that was the premise.
[15:16.780 --> 15:21.780]  And it was actually very, very successful at identifying QTLs in soybean populations.
[15:22.780 --> 15:24.780]  So, all good.
[15:24.780 --> 15:31.780]  Apart from, over time, we had so many of these QTLs in our database.
[15:31.780 --> 15:42.780]  Many of them were closely linked or had pleiotropic effects and closely linked with positive and negative alleles in cysts.
[15:42.780 --> 15:46.780]  And so breeders weren't going to spend the time to try and break up those relationships.
[15:47.780 --> 15:53.780]  And sometimes you actually had QTLs, the favorable and unfavorable, would flip in different populations.
[15:53.780 --> 15:59.780]  So, it really became too much information for breeders to be able to handle.
[15:59.780 --> 16:07.780]  And as I think about how we were handling these QTLs, it was like a game of whack-a-mole.
[16:07.780 --> 16:11.780]  It was like a QTL would pop up in one generation and disappear in the next.
[16:12.780 --> 16:16.780]  And you're constantly trying to find where the QTL is.
[16:16.780 --> 16:20.780]  And I apologize for this next slide.
[16:20.780 --> 16:24.780]  I have a new cat in my house, and I think cats are really cute.
[16:24.780 --> 16:34.780]  But this is like what I imagine it's like to be the breeder trying to predict when the QTLs are going to come.
[16:35.780 --> 16:41.780]  This is a more serious representation of what I'm trying to say.
[16:41.780 --> 16:50.780]  QTLs illustrates it very nicely, just having a merging impact of big agriculture in terms of breeding programs.
[16:50.780 --> 16:55.780]  And this is a slide I actually borrowed or stole from Roberta Chubarosa.
[16:55.780 --> 16:57.780]  With a really nice quote.
[16:57.780 --> 17:03.780]  It says, for a given QTL, it can have positive, null, or negative effects depending on the scenario.
[17:03.780 --> 17:05.780]  In this case, it was drought.
[17:05.780 --> 17:11.780]  This complication has slowed considerably the utilization of DNA for plant breeding.
[17:11.780 --> 17:15.780]  Quality of QTL data for plant breeding.
[17:15.780 --> 17:27.570]  So, you can imagine that everyone was extremely excited when genomic selection came on the scene and started to make waves.
[17:27.570 --> 17:32.570]  And we started to see that we could make a real impact with genomic selection.
[17:32.570 --> 17:39.570]  Genomic selection doesn't try and understand the underlying genes of quantitative traits.
[17:39.570 --> 17:42.570]  It just is there to prove the traits.
[17:42.570 --> 17:48.570]  So, you have your training population, which has been phenotyped and genotyped.
[17:48.570 --> 17:54.570]  And that's used to train your breeding material, which has only got genotyping data.
[17:54.570 --> 17:55.570]  So, you don't phenotype it.
[17:55.570 --> 17:59.570]  That saves you a huge amount of money to just genotype it.
[17:59.570 --> 18:08.570]  You calculate what's called GVB, or genetic estimated breeding values, and make selections based on those values.
[18:08.570 --> 18:16.570]  And it's really what is going to take corn yields through to the next generation and keep improving yields.
[18:17.570 --> 18:23.570]  And John Hickey, he's a quantitative geneticist at the Roslin Institute, has a nice quote for this.
[18:23.570 --> 18:28.570]  He feels like molecular biologists took over plant breeding.
[18:28.570 --> 18:30.570]  It used to be the domain of quantitative genetics.
[18:30.570 --> 18:39.570]  And all these QTLs were, you know, suddenly molecular geneticists were the ones that were running plant breeding.
[18:39.570 --> 18:45.570]  And now with genomic selection, quantitative geneticists are the ones that are running plant breeding.
[18:45.570 --> 18:50.570]  And quantitative geneticists have taken that plant breeding back into their own arms.
[18:50.570 --> 18:58.570]  And you can see it for some of the very visible products that Pioneer has had.
[18:58.570 --> 19:00.570]  They've bred drought-tolerant corn.
[19:00.570 --> 19:06.570]  I think there's been some seminars here on this for a product called, well, a series of products called Aquamax,
[19:07.570 --> 19:15.570]  where they're using genomic selection to select for high yield under well-watered conditions and high yield under drought conditions.
[19:15.570 --> 19:22.570]  And so you see the Aquamax products are these green squares, which have very high yields under drought conditions.
[19:22.570 --> 19:28.570]  And most interestingly, these pre-commercials come along next, you know, just even more yield.
[19:29.570 --> 19:31.570]  So I was working in markers.
[19:31.570 --> 19:36.570]  And so my job was to find the best set of markers to implement genomic selection.
[19:36.570 --> 19:39.570]  And surprisingly, you don't need many.
[19:39.570 --> 19:46.570]  This shows the number of SNPs needed to give good prediction accuracy in European corn.
[19:46.570 --> 19:52.570]  And I think this was some diallyl, diallyl, diallyl mating design.
[19:53.570 --> 20:00.570]  And so at about 300 markers, you've pretty much got a plateau for your prediction accuracy.
[20:00.570 --> 20:02.570]  There's no need to go above 300 markers.
[20:02.570 --> 20:09.570]  And you can imagine in a maize, double haploid breeding population, there's going to be even fewer markers that you're going to need.
[20:09.570 --> 20:15.970]  The type of technology was a challenge to begin with.
[20:15.970 --> 20:25.970]  It had to be low cost and low cost as in equal to the cost of a corn plot or less or a soybean plot, which is about $5.
[20:25.970 --> 20:35.970]  It has to be very robust, a high percentage of data, whether you've got horrible samples coming in from some part of the world or really bad DNA.
[20:35.970 --> 20:38.970]  It has to be really stable across different conditions.
[20:38.970 --> 20:41.970]  You have to have a consistent data matrix.
[20:42.970 --> 20:45.970]  Because of the turnaround time, you can't be imputing data.
[20:45.970 --> 20:51.970]  You can't be messing around trying to match up data sets with different markers in them.
[20:51.970 --> 20:55.970]  Breeders really like to add their own trait-specific markers.
[20:55.970 --> 20:59.970]  So you have to be flexible and be able to add in markers over time.
[21:00.970 --> 21:15.970]  And one important key just to mention here, because industry went into, took a foray into sequencing GBS technologies, low sequence coverage technologies,
[21:15.970 --> 21:23.970]  and just found that bioinformatics was too expensive and too time consuming to be able to handle.
[21:23.970 --> 21:30.970]  So they really needed a technology that just delivers you the genotyping matrix with a very fast turnaround time.
[21:32.970 --> 21:42.970]  Technologies in this space, I'm not sure what they're called now, but they used to be called the next generation genotyping or targeted sequencing technologies.
[21:42.970 --> 21:47.970]  So these are like in between sequencing and genotyping technologies.
[21:47.970 --> 21:52.970]  We have specific primers and probes that can be amplicon based or ligase based.
[21:52.970 --> 21:57.970]  And everything just goes into one big bucket and is amplified at once.
[21:57.970 --> 22:00.970]  And the samples are barcoded so you can distinguish between them.
[22:00.970 --> 22:07.970]  And the most popular one right now is the RAMP-seq technology that Ed Buckle has been looking at with high IDT.
[22:07.970 --> 22:11.970]  And that's really low cost and also highly multiplexed.
[22:14.970 --> 22:21.970]  So if we look at the turnaround time that we were dealing with May's double haploid production,
[22:22.970 --> 22:29.970]  after you'd doubled your material, you had about two weeks before transplanting.
[22:29.970 --> 22:37.970]  And the more data you could get back before transplanting, the better, because transplanting was extremely expensive.
[22:37.970 --> 22:41.970]  So they wanted to be able to get GDVs back within two weeks.
[22:41.970 --> 22:45.970]  So that was about a day to sample. And that's not a few samples.
[22:45.970 --> 22:48.970]  That's tens of thousands of samples in that one day.
[22:48.970 --> 22:57.970]  About a day for DNA extraction, maybe two days for shipping, two days for loading your data and doing your genomic selection analysis.
[22:57.970 --> 23:01.970]  That left five days to get your genotyping data back.
[23:01.970 --> 23:06.970]  So those are the kind of timelines we had to meet in the double haploid scenario.
[23:09.970 --> 23:16.970]  And so genotyping became less about science, more about running logistics.
[23:17.970 --> 23:25.970]  What steps can I co-locate? I've got my double haploid lab in the middle of South America with very limited workforce.
[23:25.970 --> 23:31.970]  Where do I put my DNA prep lab? I can't put it next to my double haploid lab because I'm probably going to fail.
[23:31.970 --> 23:35.970]  So now I have to have my DNA extraction lab separate to that.
[23:35.970 --> 23:40.970]  And in those days, vendors didn't want to mess around with plant DNA extractions.
[23:40.970 --> 23:48.970]  And so you pretty much had two steps of shipping from double haploids to DNA extraction to your genotyping lab.
[23:48.970 --> 23:55.970]  So you really had to have end-to-end systems, end-to-end communication amongst all the different components.
[23:55.970 --> 24:08.970]  The biggest risk in this whole thing became shipping and customs and understanding which countries would tolerate important export of all of these different materials.
[24:11.970 --> 24:14.970]  So meanwhile, back to my current project.
[24:15.970 --> 24:28.970]  Back in the developing countries, this graph from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation shows increases in yield between 61 and 2007.
[24:28.970 --> 24:33.970]  And you can see the US and China yields just going through the roof.
[24:33.970 --> 24:37.970]  It's like three or four times the amount of yield in that time.
[24:37.970 --> 24:41.970]  India, it's had some increase, but not very much.
[24:41.970 --> 24:44.970]  And Africa is actually pretty flat.
[24:44.970 --> 24:49.970]  It's not significantly different over all of that time, almost 60 years.
[24:49.970 --> 24:56.970]  So this is exactly where you need to have good yields, is where the populations are expanding.
[24:57.970 --> 25:08.970]  So the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation decided that one of the solutions to this was to start implementing genomic selection in the breeding programs that support these countries.
[25:08.970 --> 25:12.970]  Genomic selection needs good data management.
[25:12.970 --> 25:15.970]  And so that's where GOBI was born.
[25:15.970 --> 25:27.970]  And the goal of this project is to transform breeding by enabling the implementation of genomic and marker-assisted selection as part of routine breeding.
[25:27.970 --> 25:37.970]  And by routine, I mean all of those logistics that we were talking about in industry have to be able to come together to be able to implement genomic selection in this way.
[25:38.970 --> 25:48.970]  So our main goals was to build databases, to connect the breeding management systems, and to build and connect tools and analysis pipelines.
[25:48.970 --> 25:51.970]  And we're a global community.
[25:51.970 --> 25:56.970]  We are based here at Cornell and also at the Boyce Thompson Institute down the road.
[25:57.970 --> 26:00.970]  We collaborate with three different CG centers.
[26:00.970 --> 26:04.970]  CIMIT, which is in Mexico for maize and wheat.
[26:04.970 --> 26:07.970]  ICRISAT in India for sorghum and chickpeas.
[26:07.970 --> 26:09.970]  So I've come full circle.
[26:09.970 --> 26:11.970]  I'm now working back with ICRISAT.
[26:11.970 --> 26:15.970]  And ERI in the Philippines where we work with rice.
[26:15.970 --> 26:22.970]  And then two great institutes, Diversity Arrays and the James Hutton Institute for tool development.
[26:23.970 --> 26:32.970]  And we've built within this community a database that is super fast at being able to load data and extract data.
[26:32.970 --> 26:38.970]  The client interacts with the system via a data loader or a data extractor.
[26:38.970 --> 26:41.970]  You can load any kind of data into the system.
[26:41.970 --> 26:45.970]  You interact with the system by web services and APIs.
[26:45.970 --> 26:47.970]  The data is digested.
[26:48.970 --> 26:52.970]  And we're using a hybrid database system.
[26:52.970 --> 26:55.970]  So we use Postgres to handle the metadata.
[26:55.970 --> 27:00.970]  And then those big genotyping files are put into HDF5 format.
[27:00.970 --> 27:03.970]  And HDF5 is a NoSQL solution.
[27:03.970 --> 27:07.970]  It's super fast to be able to get data in and out of it.
[27:07.970 --> 27:09.970]  We store in two different directions.
[27:09.970 --> 27:12.970]  So we can extract the data in two different directions.
[27:13.970 --> 27:17.970]  And the whole thing is built with extract performance in mind.
[27:17.970 --> 27:23.970]  And it's actually superior to the systems I have been working with in industry.
[27:23.970 --> 27:28.970]  This is some benchmarking tests.
[27:28.970 --> 27:31.970]  So we have some test data sets.
[27:31.970 --> 27:34.970]  5,000 samples, 32 million markers.
[27:34.970 --> 27:38.970]  And this shows different databases that were benchmarked.
[27:39.970 --> 27:45.970]  And it's even better than some Hadoop-based systems that are used for big data analytics.
[27:45.970 --> 27:49.970]  This works really well with the kind of data we're handling.
[27:49.970 --> 27:57.970]  Again, for extract, this just shows increasing sizes of data and extracting them at different times.
[27:57.970 --> 28:00.970]  And it's just really fast.
[28:01.970 --> 28:06.970]  We are also developing tools, most importantly a genomic selection pipeline in Galaxy.
[28:06.970 --> 28:09.970]  And that will be publicly available soon.
[28:09.970 --> 28:18.970]  We have open source tools we've developed in a tool called Flapjack, which is a candy bar in the UK.
[28:18.970 --> 28:23.970]  And that's the tool that we're using to do the genomic selection pipeline.
[28:24.970 --> 28:28.970]  And we're working with Katie Dart to be able to do the analytics.
[28:28.970 --> 28:33.970]  A big part of this is being able to tie all these systems together.
[28:33.970 --> 28:36.970]  So we have genomic management system.
[28:36.970 --> 28:41.970]  How do we tie this with the reading management system and the analysis pipeline?
[28:41.970 --> 28:46.970]  And we're working with a team of researchers from the University of Oxford.
[28:46.970 --> 28:50.970]  And we're working with a team of researchers from the University of Oxford.
[28:51.970 --> 28:58.970]  And we're working with BRAPI, which is a breeding API, standardized API community.
[28:58.970 --> 29:08.970]  And Pete Selby, who runs this community, is based here at Cornell and also at VTI and reports to Kelly Robbins, who's also here.
[29:08.970 --> 29:11.970]  And we're running this under the Excellence in Breeding platform.
[29:12.970 --> 29:22.970]  This is a new platform that the CG centers have funded from Bill and Linda Gates to be able to consolidate a lot of this research across the CG centers.
[29:22.970 --> 29:27.970]  And Kelly Robbins is leading Module 5 in that platform.
[29:27.970 --> 29:31.970]  So we're all about community and collaboration.
[29:31.970 --> 29:36.970]  We have members of GOBI within each of the institutes that we work with.
[29:36.970 --> 29:39.970]  We do a lot of training and cross-training.
[29:39.970 --> 29:50.970]  We also really strive to work very closely with neighboring projects in GOBI so that we get the maximum value out of our resources.
[29:50.970 --> 30:03.970]  So let's look again at what is needed to be able to do genomic selection well and how well we are doing in being able to implement genomic selection.
[30:04.970 --> 30:06.970]  These are the components that we need.
[30:06.970 --> 30:14.970]  Breeding management, high-throughput sampling and shipping, genotyping platform, data management, high-throughput analysis, and APIs.
[30:14.970 --> 30:19.970]  With marker-assisted selection, you can get away with just an Excel spreadsheet.
[30:19.970 --> 30:25.970]  But as you move to genomic selection, you've really got to have everything in place and connected to be able to do this well.
[30:25.970 --> 30:29.970]  And this is the status in industry.
[30:29.970 --> 30:39.970]  They have invested over many years in all of these systems, a huge amount of resources that have been built up over tens of years.
[30:39.970 --> 30:45.970]  They've pretty much got everything in place, and they're still finding it hard to implement genomic selection.
[30:45.970 --> 30:47.970]  It's not easy for them.
[30:47.970 --> 30:57.970]  And then in the CG centers, we're suffering from little bits of money here and there, one project for this system, one project for another system.
[30:58.970 --> 31:01.970]  CG centers are not all about plant breeding.
[31:01.970 --> 31:03.970]  They are there for the greater good.
[31:03.970 --> 31:09.970]  They're there to be able to support the local communities and sustain resources.
[31:09.970 --> 31:12.970]  So plant breeding is only just a part of what they do.
[31:12.970 --> 31:19.970]  And they don't have many resources, and those resources are spread across multiple projects with multiple objectives.
[31:20.970 --> 31:27.970]  So again, excellence in breeding is trying to focus these raw resources to develop sustainable systems.
[31:27.970 --> 31:32.970]  So instead of three or four different solutions for breeding management, we just have one.
[31:35.970 --> 31:48.970]  And we need to get our ducks in a row for those systems, because coming down the road is a whole new suite of technologies in terms of data analytics and artificial intelligence on the farm.
[31:49.970 --> 31:53.970]  I just think it's amazing all of these companies that are currently active in this space.
[31:53.970 --> 31:57.970]  There's got to be a lot of venture capital around to be able to support this many companies.
[31:57.970 --> 32:00.970]  Very highly saturated market.
[32:00.970 --> 32:10.970]  We've got precision analytics, so where you're going to put your hybrid on the farm, understanding your marketplaces, robotics and drones, sensors, smart irrigation.
[32:10.970 --> 32:15.970]  And down here, this is the genetic plant breeding space.
[32:16.970 --> 32:19.970]  So there's not so much in the plant breeding space.
[32:19.970 --> 32:27.970]  If you fancy setting up your own company, I would recommend this is the space to look for your AI technology.
[32:27.970 --> 32:44.970]  But we are seeing a lot of new information coming out about using big data analytics, machine learning to understand quantitative traits, gene networks, gene complexes, gene communities.
[32:44.970 --> 32:50.970]  We're also seeing a lot of new information coming out of allele mining technologies, which is really exciting.
[32:50.970 --> 33:00.970]  Where you look at the diversity of alleles across your species and try and track them to a particular geographic location or a particular phenotype.
[33:00.970 --> 33:04.970]  And you can use that also to understand your traits.
[33:06.970 --> 33:13.970]  Of course, now we have CRISPR, where we can edit the DNA and inject the mutation that we want.
[33:13.970 --> 33:21.970]  And we're seeing multiplexed CRISPR platforms now where you can do four or five of these mutations in one go.
[33:21.970 --> 33:25.970]  It's not very reliable yet, but I'm sure it will be soon.
[33:25.970 --> 33:36.970]  And so now we can take all of the information that we get through AI and big data and allele mining and start to plug it into our CRISPR mutations in the breeding cycle.
[33:37.970 --> 33:43.970]  And, to quote John Hickenlooper again, let the biologists have it back.
[33:43.970 --> 33:48.970]  Gene editing is really going to change the landscaping of breeding in the future.
[33:50.970 --> 33:58.970]  And I'd say also, I actually worked in IP when I was at Pioneer for eight years at the time that I was there.
[33:58.970 --> 34:04.970]  And this is really going to change how IP lawyers can patent material.
[34:04.970 --> 34:12.970]  In the era of genomics data, there really, I mean, in genomics and genomic selection, there really wasn't a lot to patent.
[34:12.970 --> 34:15.970]  You didn't have any unique sequences.
[34:15.970 --> 34:19.970]  There were method patents for the genomic selection methodologies.
[34:19.970 --> 34:21.970]  And there's plant patents.
[34:21.970 --> 34:24.970]  Method patents are hard to police.
[34:24.970 --> 34:27.970]  Plant patents are only available in the US.
[34:27.970 --> 34:39.970]  I can just see these IP lawyers salivating over the years to have unique sequences caused by CRISPR with a function that can be used to patent materials globally.
[34:39.970 --> 34:43.970]  And also that are easy to police because you've got all those sequences there.
[34:43.970 --> 34:48.970]  I can just see a sequence on every chromosome arm to protect the germplasm.
[34:48.970 --> 34:59.970]  So that might make life complicated for all of us, but will fuel a huge amount of investments from industry in plant breeding and genetics.
[34:59.970 --> 35:07.970]  And like it or not, that is going to advance plant breeding and benefit communities and improve yields.
[35:09.970 --> 35:11.970]  This is one of Ed's slides.
[35:11.970 --> 35:13.970]  So I've stolen this one.
[35:14.970 --> 35:22.970]  And so he talks about breeding 1.0 phenotypic selection, controlled traits 2.0 with QTLs.
[35:22.970 --> 35:25.970]  We're here, genomic selection in 3.0.
[35:25.970 --> 35:28.970]  This 4.0 is really exciting.
[35:28.970 --> 35:31.970]  There's a whole bunch of technologies happening in this space.
[35:31.970 --> 35:38.970]  And it's really going to change how we do plant breeding in terms of discovery.
[35:39.970 --> 36:05.970]  But I believe that no matter how many tools you have to be able to elucidate gene complexes and understand those gene complexes using all this AI and machine learning, you're still going to struggle to be able to move those genes into breeding material to keep up with the parent selection cycle.
[36:05.970 --> 36:26.970]  Unless we can have CRISPR technologies that can instantaneously mutate lines as they go through that breeding cycle, or unless those traits are of extremely high value, the value of that continuous breeding cycle is just not going to allow those new QTLs in, however much we know.
[36:26.970 --> 36:32.970]  So I really think it's going to be a combination of these two spaces into the future.
[36:35.970 --> 36:38.970]  And that's because biology isn't easy.
[36:38.970 --> 36:44.970]  The more we look at genetics and the more we look at biology, the more complicated it gets.
[36:44.970 --> 36:51.970]  And so we can have these new tools, and we can try and delve down into the rabbit hole of that complexity.
[36:51.970 --> 36:55.970]  But in the end, genomic selection is all about keeping it simple.
[36:55.970 --> 36:57.970]  And that's where it's prone to stay.
[36:57.970 --> 36:59.970]  Okay?
[37:00.970 --> 37:01.970]  Sure.
[37:01.970 --> 37:24.970]  Thank you.
[37:24.970 --> 37:34.830]  long do we think the public CG centers are going to be able to catch up here with industry.
[37:34.830 --> 37:37.790]  I don't think we'll ever catch up with industry.
[37:37.790 --> 37:42.790]  I think we have to accept that we just have to have a working system in place.
[37:42.790 --> 37:48.310]  It's never going to be to the level that industry has because we just don't have those investments.
[37:48.310 --> 37:53.790]  But we can put a pretty good system in place.
[37:53.790 --> 38:00.790]  And I would say to turn all of these faces, happy two years at the end of our project.
[38:00.790 --> 38:09.790]  Thank you for the talk.
[38:09.790 --> 38:18.790]  I'm trying to understand how your SCOBY project is trying to address the instagnation you
[38:18.790 --> 38:21.790]  mentioned by the Gates Foundation.
[38:21.790 --> 38:28.790]  Because as you showed that breeding programs only have a small part of the project.
[38:28.790 --> 38:36.790]  I'm wondering how or if it is addressing the yield stagnation problem.
[38:36.790 --> 38:42.790]  We hope to address the yield stagnation problem, but it's certainly not the only component
[38:42.790 --> 38:43.790]  of yield stagnation.
[38:44.790 --> 38:49.790]  Nitrogen is a huge part of that and getting fertilizers out to the right places and the
[38:49.790 --> 38:52.790]  right fertilizers and the right applications.
[38:52.790 --> 38:57.790]  That's another project that the Gates Foundation is funding.
[38:57.790 --> 39:03.790]  And also seed purity is a massive issue for yield losses in Africa.
[39:03.790 --> 39:10.790]  The seed is either counterfeit seed or it's just the wrong cross was accidentally made.
[39:10.790 --> 39:16.790]  It's very high rate just bad seeds.
[39:16.790 --> 39:23.790]  And so by putting in seed purity, seed quality mechanisms, which we're helping to do through
[39:23.790 --> 39:28.790]  our project too, that's going to make huge advances just by itself in improving yield.
[39:28.790 --> 39:33.790]  And then genomic selection, if we can make that happen, and marker-assisted selection
[39:33.790 --> 39:36.790]  can also have a component of increasing yield.
[39:37.790 --> 39:40.790]  So yeah, certainly not just genomic selection.
[39:40.790 --> 40:01.790]  So I understand that you are developing tools for doing that, but are you also trying to
[40:02.790 --> 40:04.790]  build strategies to scale it out?
[40:04.790 --> 40:12.790]  Are you just developing a tool on that thing?
[40:12.790 --> 40:16.790]  Yeah, that's a very good question.
[40:16.790 --> 40:21.790]  So yes, we're developing the tool here at Cornell, but we spend a lot of time going
[40:21.790 --> 40:26.790]  out to the CG centers and finding out how to integrate it into their systems, working
[40:27.790 --> 40:34.790]  with their other systems to be able to make it a workable model in the CG systems, testing
[40:34.790 --> 40:36.790]  it to see if it's scalable.
[40:36.790 --> 40:40.790]  Right now we'll be working on actually making it smaller and more deployable.
[40:40.790 --> 40:47.790]  And because the CG centers, some new CG centers want to be able to deploy to their centers.
[40:47.790 --> 40:50.790]  So yes, scaling it.
[40:50.790 --> 40:51.790]  Right now we're building it.
[40:51.790 --> 40:53.790]  Scaling it is the next phase.
[40:54.790 --> 40:56.790]  So we're really working on it.
[40:56.790 --> 40:57.790]  It's the next step.
[40:57.790 --> 40:58.790]  Thank you.
[41:05.210 --> 41:06.210]  Thanks for your talk.
[41:06.210 --> 41:07.210]  I learned a lot.
[41:07.210 --> 41:12.210]  I'm an economist, and I hope I'm not the only one in the room, but it looks like it might be.
[41:12.210 --> 41:18.210]  So one question about the environment, because a lot of this breeding happens with given
[41:18.210 --> 41:20.210]  climate, given soils.
[41:21.210 --> 41:27.210]  And so a lot of, when we think about technologies being adopted in different countries, and
[41:27.210 --> 41:31.210]  we think about those transfers of genetic material going from one place to another one,
[41:31.210 --> 41:35.210]  we don't necessarily control for the environment in the other locations.
[41:35.210 --> 41:39.210]  So how is the environment dealt with in this system?
[41:39.210 --> 41:43.210]  And I hope my question makes sense.
[41:43.210 --> 41:45.210]  Is that clear enough?
[41:45.210 --> 41:47.210]  I think so.
[41:47.210 --> 41:52.210]  So the experiments that we're doing within the relevant environments that the materials
[41:52.210 --> 41:58.210]  can be grown in, and that's handled by the plant breeders in the CG centers, who understand
[41:58.210 --> 42:03.210]  those environments and where they need to be testing materials in.
[42:03.210 --> 42:08.210]  And any environmental variation will become part of the model for genomic selection as
[42:08.210 --> 42:09.210]  well.
[42:09.210 --> 42:13.210]  Okay, and climate change, so that was like a follow-up question on that.
[42:13.210 --> 42:20.210]  So how is that, are these systems accounting for that, or is there a way that that can
[42:20.210 --> 42:25.210]  come in through this, or are they too, are they kind of myopic in that sense?
[42:25.210 --> 42:30.210]  Right, they're testing right now in the environments that they are in, but drought tolerance, salinity
[42:30.210 --> 42:36.210]  tolerance, are very important traits as well that they do test in, as well as yield.
[42:36.210 --> 42:42.210]  As far as predicting for the future changes in environment, I'm sure modeling could have
[42:42.210 --> 42:48.210]  a role in that space to be able to incorporate that into future models.
[42:48.210 --> 42:57.680]  Okay?
[42:57.680 --> 43:02.680]  Nobody's walking out on me, so maybe there's an incubation process.
[43:02.680 --> 43:06.680]  Just give people a minute, which is why I'm circling back.
[43:07.680 --> 43:13.680]  Just a general question, you said genomic selection is simple, when is it not simple?
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.680]  When is genomic selection not simple?
[43:17.680 --> 43:19.680]  Or do you feel like...
[43:19.680 --> 43:22.680]  You don't have the right models, or...
[43:22.680 --> 43:24.680]  Okay, simpler.
[43:24.680 --> 43:27.680]  I'm trying to understand gene comfort.
[43:27.680 --> 43:32.680]  And genomic selection can get very messy if you don't have the right models or the right
[43:32.680 --> 43:34.680]  experimental design.
[43:35.680 --> 43:38.680]  I was curious to hear what your thoughts are on that.
[43:38.680 --> 43:42.680]  Because I certainly don't feel that it's a simple point yet.
[43:42.680 --> 43:45.680]  We're trying to get that in play.
[43:45.680 --> 43:51.680]  I think the design of it is complicated, but once you have a good design, and a good experimental
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.680]  design, it's very simple to implement as part of the routine.
[43:56.680 --> 43:59.680]  Yeah, that's what I was wondering.
[44:02.680 --> 44:03.680]  Thank you.
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.680]  I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more about how you mentioned CRISPR will
[44:08.680 --> 44:13.680]  affect and be integrated into the GOBI project if there's less emphasis on understanding
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.680]  gene architecture and the underlying genes.
[44:17.680 --> 44:21.680]  My understanding of CRISPR is that you would need to really understand the sequences to
[44:21.680 --> 44:23.680]  be fully utilized.
[44:23.680 --> 44:28.680]  Right, CRISPR is not going to be part of the GOBI project, but that's for sure.
[44:28.680 --> 44:31.680]  We're very much focused on genomic selection.
[44:32.680 --> 44:39.680]  CRISPR is very much being incorporated and prioritized in industry breeding programs
[44:39.680 --> 44:45.680]  because of the patent protection that it gives them, and because it's less likely to be regulated
[44:45.680 --> 44:47.680]  than transgenes.
[44:47.680 --> 44:50.680]  And the patent protection is not going to be that important.
[44:50.680 --> 44:53.680]  So yeah, it's going to be huge in industry.
[44:56.680 --> 44:58.680]  Did that answer your question?
[44:58.680 --> 44:59.680]  Yeah, it did.
[44:59.680 --> 45:03.680]  Part of your talk, and I think I missed, but it was separate from GOBI's focus.
[45:03.680 --> 45:04.680]  Thank you.
[45:05.680 --> 45:07.680]  Okay, thank you very much.
