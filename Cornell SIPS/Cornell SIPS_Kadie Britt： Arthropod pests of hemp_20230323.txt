[00:00.000 --> 00:08.060]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.060 --> 00:08.900]  Hi, everyone.
[00:08.900 --> 00:12.140]  Welcome again to the 2023 HEMP webinar series.
[00:12.140 --> 00:14.020]  Once again, your host, Luis Monserrati.
[00:14.020 --> 00:15.980]  I'm a second year PhD student accompanied
[00:15.980 --> 00:17.940]  with Tony Baracco, a Cornell alum that
[00:17.940 --> 00:20.700]  has been helping me organize this and put together
[00:20.700 --> 00:23.580]  all the data platform along with Gemma.
[00:23.580 --> 00:25.380]  Lastly, I just want to remind everyone
[00:25.380 --> 00:28.020]  that this webinar is going to be a component of a larger
[00:28.020 --> 00:29.860]  project, which is the development
[00:29.860 --> 00:32.540]  of educational modules that will be freely
[00:32.540 --> 00:34.660]  available on the Cornell website.
[00:34.660 --> 00:37.380]  This module, or each of the eight modules,
[00:37.380 --> 00:40.340]  will have the recorded webinar, an instructional slide deck,
[00:40.340 --> 00:43.860]  and a set of high impact papers respective to each subject.
[00:43.860 --> 00:47.180]  In this case, it will be HEMPest, for example.
[00:47.180 --> 00:50.580]  And also to remind you and remind others
[00:50.580 --> 00:55.220]  that this webinar, as well as future and past webinars,
[00:55.220 --> 00:58.380]  will be available on the Cornell SIPS YouTube channel
[00:58.380 --> 01:00.500]  if you're interested in re-watching them or sharing
[01:00.500 --> 01:01.900]  them with somebody else.
[01:01.940 --> 01:05.940]  So with that, it is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Katie Britt.
[01:05.940 --> 01:08.860]  She's a postdoctoral scholar affiliated
[01:08.860 --> 01:10.620]  with the University of California, Riverside,
[01:10.620 --> 01:12.180]  in the Department of Anthropology.
[01:12.180 --> 01:13.940]  I do not want to extend introduction
[01:13.940 --> 01:16.180]  because I'm sure that she will like most of the time
[01:16.180 --> 01:18.500]  to cover her content.
[01:18.500 --> 01:20.100]  And I just want to say that her talk's
[01:20.100 --> 01:23.660]  going to be on Arthropod Pests on High-Cannabinoid HEMP.
[01:23.660 --> 01:28.460]  So without further ado, please, Dr. Britt, take it away.
[01:28.460 --> 01:29.900]  Thanks, Luis.
[01:29.900 --> 01:31.580]  Well, yeah, thanks for the introduction
[01:32.260 --> 01:34.060]  and thanks for the invitation to be here.
[01:34.060 --> 01:35.780]  I really appreciate the opportunity
[01:35.780 --> 01:39.780]  to share what I've gathered so far over several years
[01:39.780 --> 01:42.380]  of studying insect and mite pests in HEMP,
[01:42.380 --> 01:46.100]  or better known as arthropods.
[01:46.100 --> 01:50.900]  Before we jump in, I wanted to put my email address here.
[01:50.900 --> 01:54.140]  If you have questions or comments or anything
[01:54.140 --> 01:57.300]  to share about anything that I cover today,
[01:57.300 --> 01:58.460]  feel free to reach out.
[01:58.460 --> 02:00.500]  I always like talking about this work.
[02:00.500 --> 02:04.060]  And I'm really happy to help if you need it in any way
[02:04.060 --> 02:06.180]  that I can.
[02:06.180 --> 02:08.620]  Also, really briefly, there's a lot to cover.
[02:08.620 --> 02:13.020]  But I just wanted to tell you who I am and my experience
[02:13.020 --> 02:15.420]  in this realm of work.
[02:15.420 --> 02:16.260]  I'm Katie.
[02:16.260 --> 02:20.980]  I earned my PhD in entomology from Virginia Tech
[02:20.980 --> 02:23.500]  just over two years ago.
[02:23.500 --> 02:26.580]  The focus of that work was insect and mite pest management
[02:26.580 --> 02:27.860]  in HEMP.
[02:27.900 --> 02:31.460]  Started that in 2017 when HEMP was really, really new,
[02:31.460 --> 02:33.500]  wrapped up in 2021.
[02:33.500 --> 02:36.820]  After finishing that degree, I came out to California
[02:37.740 --> 02:41.300]  and have been doing a postdoc with UC Riverside,
[02:41.300 --> 02:43.340]  focused on the same type of work.
[02:44.940 --> 02:47.620]  And as Louise said, I'm affiliated with UC Riverside,
[02:47.620 --> 02:49.300]  but I'm not in Southern California.
[02:49.300 --> 02:52.340]  I'm located at an off-campus research station
[02:52.340 --> 02:54.780]  in the Central Valley, just outside of Fresno.
[02:54.780 --> 02:57.740]  So enough about that.
[02:58.620 --> 02:59.460]  I'm gonna jump right in.
[02:59.460 --> 03:01.260]  I have so many things to cover today.
[03:01.260 --> 03:04.860]  Hopefully it won't go over time, but yeah,
[03:04.860 --> 03:05.780]  let's get started.
[03:05.780 --> 03:09.020]  So again, I'm covering arthropods associated with HEMP.
[03:09.020 --> 03:12.060]  This focuses on insects and mites.
[03:12.060 --> 03:15.020]  The bulk of what I've got to tell you about
[03:15.020 --> 03:18.060]  are pest species, but it's worth noting
[03:18.060 --> 03:21.220]  that it's not just pests, arthropods that are associated
[03:21.220 --> 03:22.660]  with HEMP or cannabis.
[03:24.220 --> 03:26.820]  If you walk through a field, an outdoor field
[03:26.820 --> 03:28.300]  or an indoor production system,
[03:28.300 --> 03:30.740]  you're going to see an abundance of species.
[03:30.740 --> 03:32.100]  A lot of those are bad guys.
[03:32.100 --> 03:33.380]  Some of those are good guys.
[03:33.380 --> 03:35.420]  Some of those are just passing through
[03:36.580 --> 03:40.580]  as in occasional feeders or transient species.
[03:40.580 --> 03:44.100]  Sometimes they're attracted to HEMP because it's there.
[03:44.100 --> 03:45.740]  It's an available food source.
[03:45.740 --> 03:48.140]  They might try to feed on it before they find
[03:48.140 --> 03:50.460]  that they don't like it or want to move on,
[03:50.460 --> 03:52.460]  or they see something in the HEMP
[03:52.460 --> 03:53.780]  that they're attracted to,
[03:54.860 --> 03:56.700]  and they could be attracted to another species
[03:57.580 --> 03:58.500]  that's more than the crop itself.
[03:58.500 --> 04:00.780]  So again, it's worth noting that you're going to see
[04:00.780 --> 04:04.660]  a lot of insect and mite activity, but not all of it is bad.
[04:05.740 --> 04:08.900]  But we're going to focus on some of the bad ones today.
[04:08.900 --> 04:11.060]  So the first and foremost that I want to talk about
[04:11.060 --> 04:12.700]  is corn earworm.
[04:12.700 --> 04:15.700]  I always say this is not an if pest, it's a when.
[04:15.700 --> 04:18.900]  If you're growing a crop outdoors, you're going to see this
[04:18.900 --> 04:22.620]  and your crop is likely to be damaged from it.
[04:22.620 --> 04:25.300]  I've tried to put this beginning slide
[04:25.340 --> 04:28.140]  on the key pests that I'm going to discuss today.
[04:28.140 --> 04:30.900]  So I've got the common name up top
[04:30.900 --> 04:34.100]  along with the scientific name, where it's found,
[04:34.100 --> 04:37.660]  whether it's a generalist or a specialist,
[04:37.660 --> 04:39.940]  whether you can find it indoor or outdoor,
[04:39.940 --> 04:42.860]  and the likelihood of encountering this pest
[04:42.860 --> 04:44.740]  in your operation.
[04:44.740 --> 04:48.460]  So this is a pest that's found pretty much everywhere.
[04:48.460 --> 04:49.980]  It's found outdoors.
[04:49.980 --> 04:53.260]  Only in rare situations can it be found indoors.
[04:54.260 --> 04:56.140]  And that's usually because it came in
[04:56.140 --> 04:59.500]  on some harvested material.
[04:59.500 --> 05:01.020]  And I say likelihood of encounter,
[05:01.020 --> 05:04.540]  this is pretty certain if you're producing a crop outdoors.
[05:04.540 --> 05:06.540]  So again, it's a key pest of hemp.
[05:07.660 --> 05:11.620]  I think the number one pest that may differ
[05:11.620 --> 05:13.620]  based on the system that you're producing in,
[05:13.620 --> 05:16.780]  but I always stick by the fact that this is pretty much
[05:16.780 --> 05:18.820]  the number one pest of hemp.
[05:18.820 --> 05:20.060]  This is what it looks like.
[05:20.060 --> 05:21.940]  It's a caterpillar.
[05:22.340 --> 05:23.860]  The belt stage is a moth.
[05:23.860 --> 05:26.660]  It's a pretty drab colored tan moth.
[05:29.020 --> 05:31.140]  On the photo on the left,
[05:31.140 --> 05:33.500]  you can see where she's actually laying eggs
[05:33.500 --> 05:34.620]  in a hemp plant.
[05:34.620 --> 05:37.860]  And on the right has some photos of the actual eggs.
[05:37.860 --> 05:40.140]  They're really, really tiny.
[05:40.140 --> 05:41.980]  They're visible to the naked eye,
[05:41.980 --> 05:43.860]  but they're difficult to see
[05:43.860 --> 05:46.660]  just because this tiny egg can really blend in
[05:46.660 --> 05:48.620]  with the rest of the plant material.
[05:49.460 --> 05:52.260]  But they are visible, like I said.
[05:52.260 --> 05:53.780]  Here's some more photos.
[05:53.780 --> 05:56.140]  They can vary in size as they move
[05:56.140 --> 05:58.380]  and develop throughout the plant.
[05:58.380 --> 06:00.260]  They can differ in coloration
[06:00.260 --> 06:02.780]  as well as location throughout the plant.
[06:03.980 --> 06:07.140]  Larval coloration in particular can vary.
[06:07.140 --> 06:09.820]  Most of the caterpillars that you see in hemp
[06:09.820 --> 06:11.620]  are going to be a bright green,
[06:11.620 --> 06:13.060]  but again, that depends.
[06:13.060 --> 06:15.020]  Sometimes they can be darker in color.
[06:15.020 --> 06:15.980]  They can be yellow.
[06:16.620 --> 06:21.620]  They can be pink, black, brown, quite a spectrum.
[06:22.220 --> 06:24.380]  So they're really attracted to hemp
[06:24.380 --> 06:26.580]  when it begins to flower
[06:26.580 --> 06:30.140]  as are most arthropods that we cover today.
[06:30.140 --> 06:31.100]  So they're attracted to
[06:31.100 --> 06:34.060]  and they feed from the inflorescence portion of the crop,
[06:34.060 --> 06:36.020]  which is the attractive portion.
[06:36.020 --> 06:39.780]  Once the inflorescences start to form,
[06:39.780 --> 06:41.940]  moths, female moths are active
[06:41.940 --> 06:45.220]  and they may begin laying eggs on the crop at this time.
[06:46.540 --> 06:49.260]  So it can be tricky to find them sometimes
[06:49.260 --> 06:51.380]  because they'll nestle in plants,
[06:51.380 --> 06:54.060]  as you can see in the photo on the left.
[06:54.060 --> 06:57.180]  And in addition to chewing bud structures,
[06:57.180 --> 06:59.940]  they can just chew all throughout the plant.
[06:59.940 --> 07:01.540]  Sometimes they'll feed from leaves,
[07:01.540 --> 07:04.500]  but it's more commonly stems and bud material.
[07:06.180 --> 07:09.620]  Their chewing can really damage the integrity of the stem.
[07:09.620 --> 07:13.220]  So you see the feeding wound in the middle of this photo.
[07:14.220 --> 07:17.020]  Basically the rest of the plant material
[07:17.020 --> 07:18.980]  that's attached to where this wound is
[07:18.980 --> 07:20.740]  is likely going to die.
[07:20.740 --> 07:24.420]  So it's going to rot and create this brown coloration
[07:24.420 --> 07:26.260]  and just end up with rotted material
[07:26.260 --> 07:28.580]  that you can't really do anything with.
[07:28.580 --> 07:31.700]  And it's just making your bud material ugly
[07:31.700 --> 07:35.540]  and taking away some material that you would harvest.
[07:35.540 --> 07:37.540]  So again, these feeding injuries
[07:37.540 --> 07:39.380]  can lead to what we call bud rot.
[07:40.340 --> 07:42.580]  Sometimes it can come from just the stem
[07:42.900 --> 07:44.740]  being clipped and that plant material
[07:44.740 --> 07:46.540]  just straight up dying off.
[07:46.540 --> 07:49.820]  But I think more commonly what is happening
[07:49.820 --> 07:52.140]  is that this caterpillar is coming in,
[07:52.140 --> 07:54.860]  feeding on the plant and creating these wounds
[07:54.860 --> 07:57.020]  and pathogens that exist in the environment
[07:57.020 --> 07:59.940]  are able to get in via these feeding wounds,
[07:59.940 --> 08:03.700]  which ends up causing rotted material in the plant.
[08:03.700 --> 08:06.100]  So rot, I think, you know,
[08:06.100 --> 08:09.420]  it's concentrated in these bud portions.
[08:09.420 --> 08:12.540]  It's typically more towards the top of the plant,
[08:13.340 --> 08:14.580]  but not always.
[08:14.580 --> 08:15.700]  It can be present anywhere.
[08:15.700 --> 08:16.900]  There is bud material.
[08:16.900 --> 08:18.180]  And like I was saying earlier,
[08:18.180 --> 08:20.460]  it's just really undesirable.
[08:20.460 --> 08:21.900]  If you're trying to harvest this
[08:21.900 --> 08:24.460]  to sell it as a raw material, you know,
[08:24.460 --> 08:27.220]  there's going to be speckled spots of rot throughout it.
[08:27.220 --> 08:29.380]  And it's really highly undesirable.
[08:31.100 --> 08:34.020]  Their frass, also known as insect poop,
[08:34.020 --> 08:36.820]  can also be an additional contaminant.
[08:36.820 --> 08:40.180]  These photos are from my time in Virginia,
[08:40.180 --> 08:41.940]  which is a more humid climate
[08:41.940 --> 08:44.140]  than the West where I'm at now.
[08:44.140 --> 08:48.820]  But, you know, pathogens are a major concern.
[08:48.820 --> 08:50.300]  And like I've stated,
[08:50.300 --> 08:51.900]  and anytime there's feeding wounds,
[08:51.900 --> 08:53.460]  these pathogens can get in.
[08:54.380 --> 08:56.540]  It's just, it's gross.
[08:56.540 --> 08:57.780]  It's really undesirable.
[08:57.780 --> 09:01.020]  You don't want them anywhere near the plant really,
[09:01.020 --> 09:03.020]  but they're going to be there.
[09:03.020 --> 09:06.460]  More photos where the caterpillar has just eaten
[09:06.460 --> 09:07.900]  and moved throughout the plant
[09:07.900 --> 09:10.140]  and deposited its frass along the way.
[09:10.140 --> 09:11.500]  It's yucky.
[09:11.500 --> 09:12.460]  It's gross.
[09:12.460 --> 09:14.540]  You really don't want to see this.
[09:16.180 --> 09:18.820]  So what do we know about this pest
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.300]  and what has field research told us?
[09:21.300 --> 09:24.140]  So this is published in an open access publication
[09:24.140 --> 09:26.140]  through the Journal of Integrated Pest Management.
[09:26.140 --> 09:28.420]  There's a screenshot of the article below.
[09:28.420 --> 09:30.100]  You want to access it.
[09:32.100 --> 09:34.740]  You know, the photo of the trap on the right,
[09:34.740 --> 09:37.660]  this is an adult moth or an earworm trap.
[09:38.420 --> 09:40.100]  This is used in other type of crop systems
[09:40.100 --> 09:41.460]  like soybeans and corn,
[09:41.460 --> 09:43.700]  where corn earworm is also a pest.
[09:43.700 --> 09:44.860]  You know, it'd be really great
[09:44.860 --> 09:46.660]  if we could use these in hemp.
[09:47.660 --> 09:50.620]  You can definitely use these traps in hemp
[09:50.620 --> 09:53.020]  to alert you that moths are active
[09:53.020 --> 09:55.100]  and circulating around the field.
[09:55.100 --> 09:57.940]  But unfortunately, the number of moths
[09:57.940 --> 10:00.500]  that are caught in traps doesn't seem to correlate
[10:00.500 --> 10:03.420]  with larval abundance at the sites
[10:03.420 --> 10:05.260]  where we've conducted studies.
[10:05.860 --> 10:09.220]  So again, pheromone traps can let you know
[10:09.220 --> 10:10.380]  that moths are active
[10:10.380 --> 10:13.140]  and potentially depositing eggs on the crop,
[10:13.140 --> 10:16.820]  but it's really not always a reliable predictor
[10:16.820 --> 10:18.820]  of larval presence in the crop.
[10:18.820 --> 10:21.100]  That really comes from you scouting it
[10:21.100 --> 10:23.620]  and knowing what's going on in your crop.
[10:23.620 --> 10:25.900]  As far as corn earworm management,
[10:25.900 --> 10:28.500]  this is going to differ based on where you're located
[10:28.500 --> 10:31.100]  and what typical pesticide rules are
[10:31.100 --> 10:34.220]  based on where you live and where you produce your crop.
[10:34.500 --> 10:36.060]  But something I at least want to draw
[10:36.060 --> 10:40.340]  your particular attention to is a group of insecticides
[10:40.340 --> 10:45.060]  that are called nucleo-polyhedroviruses, the big word.
[10:45.060 --> 10:47.100]  You could use NPV for short.
[10:48.100 --> 10:49.980]  I've done some studies with these,
[10:49.980 --> 10:52.100]  particularly in Virginia.
[10:52.100 --> 10:55.780]  And, you know, it's not a silver bullet by any means,
[10:55.780 --> 10:57.540]  but it is at least an option
[10:57.540 --> 11:01.780]  that I think I want you to know about.
[11:01.780 --> 11:03.620]  You know, the only thing with using these products
[11:04.100 --> 11:05.420]  timing is really important.
[11:05.420 --> 11:07.780]  You've got to target really small caterpillars.
[11:07.780 --> 11:09.220]  So again, this comes from scouting,
[11:09.220 --> 11:11.700]  knowing that the pest is in your field,
[11:11.700 --> 11:14.460]  you can apply an insecticide at the correct time
[11:14.460 --> 11:16.020]  and get greater efficacy.
[11:16.940 --> 11:19.660]  Its only target is corn earworm,
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.380]  so it's safe for non-targets,
[11:21.380 --> 11:24.500]  unlike BT or other types of biopesticides,
[11:24.500 --> 11:27.660]  which may attack more species.
[11:28.700 --> 11:31.260]  So what it looks like when corn earworm larvae
[11:31.260 --> 11:33.420]  are infected by this virus,
[11:34.220 --> 11:36.540]  they kind of just look melted and kind of snotty,
[11:36.540 --> 11:39.940]  like hanging on the bud material of the plant.
[11:39.940 --> 11:42.060]  So it looks really gross, but it's a good sign
[11:42.060 --> 11:44.940]  that means the insecticide is working.
[11:44.940 --> 11:47.100]  Additionally, larvae will migrate
[11:47.100 --> 11:50.100]  to the top portion of the plant as they die.
[11:50.100 --> 11:53.140]  And as they are dying, as their body breaks down,
[11:53.140 --> 11:56.300]  viral particles will spread throughout the field.
[11:56.300 --> 11:58.380]  So it's just letting you know
[11:58.380 --> 12:00.580]  that this type of insecticide exists.
[12:00.580 --> 12:03.380]  And I think it's a decent option
[12:03.380 --> 12:04.780]  for corn earworm management
[12:04.780 --> 12:07.140]  based on what we know at this point.
[12:07.140 --> 12:10.460]  So that was a lot of information about one pest,
[12:10.460 --> 12:12.380]  but to wrap this section up,
[12:12.380 --> 12:14.140]  this is a very damaging pest
[12:14.140 --> 12:17.340]  and it's going to remain a damaging pest in hemp
[12:18.340 --> 12:21.820]  under outdoor production for the foreseeable future.
[12:21.820 --> 12:24.060]  The best option for management at this time
[12:24.060 --> 12:27.140]  is to remain diligent, scout as often as you can
[12:27.140 --> 12:28.620]  and initiate control measures,
[12:28.620 --> 12:31.980]  whatever you decide to do at the first appearance of larvae
[12:31.980 --> 12:33.580]  because no matter what you do,
[12:33.580 --> 12:35.780]  everything works better with smaller larvae.
[12:36.860 --> 12:39.380]  Of the allowable options,
[12:39.380 --> 12:42.420]  the virus insecticides may offer the highest level
[12:42.420 --> 12:45.020]  of earworm suppression at this point,
[12:45.020 --> 12:46.740]  but we need more research,
[12:46.740 --> 12:48.700]  which is the theme for everything
[12:48.700 --> 12:49.980]  that I'll talk about today
[12:49.980 --> 12:52.780]  in any conversation you would have with me about this topic.
[12:52.780 --> 12:53.860]  We need more work.
[12:53.860 --> 12:55.940]  We need more work across more locations
[12:55.940 --> 12:57.220]  so that we know what's going on
[12:57.260 --> 12:59.820]  in different regions across the country.
[12:59.820 --> 13:02.300]  So that's all for corn earworm.
[13:02.300 --> 13:04.660]  Next target is cannabis aphid.
[13:04.660 --> 13:08.300]  So the scientific name is spore-dawn cannabis.
[13:08.300 --> 13:10.820]  The range, as far as I know, it's everywhere.
[13:10.820 --> 13:12.820]  Anywhere that you would grow hemp or cannabis,
[13:12.820 --> 13:14.980]  you're likely to see this insect.
[13:14.980 --> 13:16.100]  It's a specialist,
[13:16.100 --> 13:20.060]  meaning that it exclusively feeds from hemp or cannabis,
[13:20.060 --> 13:23.500]  and this can be found in indoor or outdoor crops.
[13:23.500 --> 13:25.660]  Likelihood of encounter, I say probable
[13:25.660 --> 13:27.180]  just because it's a specialist.
[13:27.980 --> 13:29.980]  So it's highly likely that you'll see it.
[13:31.380 --> 13:33.260]  So like I've said,
[13:33.260 --> 13:35.620]  cannabis sativa is the only plant species
[13:35.620 --> 13:38.420]  in which this species will feed from.
[13:38.420 --> 13:40.620]  It is a specialist, so it, you know,
[13:40.620 --> 13:42.660]  planting other crops to try and distract
[13:42.660 --> 13:46.140]  this particular aphid won't really work here.
[13:46.140 --> 13:49.700]  This aphid is typically light green,
[13:49.700 --> 13:53.380]  maybe light yellow, kind of clear in coloration.
[13:53.380 --> 13:54.700]  It can have wings.
[13:54.700 --> 13:56.380]  It cannot have wings.
[13:56.420 --> 13:58.620]  It can be a smaller aphid.
[13:58.620 --> 13:59.860]  It can be a larger aphid.
[13:59.860 --> 14:02.980]  You name it, you might see it as cannabis aphid.
[14:03.900 --> 14:05.340]  There is, you know,
[14:05.340 --> 14:08.860]  pretty good potential for parasitism of this aphid
[14:08.860 --> 14:11.020]  by parasitoid wasps,
[14:12.500 --> 14:14.380]  and more research is being done
[14:14.380 --> 14:15.700]  with these particular wasps
[14:15.700 --> 14:18.340]  to figure out what kind of target is best.
[14:19.500 --> 14:22.740]  So I'm gonna give a shout out to Andrea Garfinkel
[14:22.740 --> 14:25.580]  from Oregon CBD for this photo.
[14:25.580 --> 14:27.860]  This is a really helpful image
[14:27.860 --> 14:30.980]  that kind of shows a key identification characteristic
[14:30.980 --> 14:32.100]  of this aphid.
[14:32.100 --> 14:34.380]  It has these really pronounced nodules
[14:35.940 --> 14:37.180]  on its head capsule,
[14:37.180 --> 14:39.180]  which if you look at this under a microscope
[14:39.180 --> 14:41.420]  and you see these little horn projections,
[14:41.420 --> 14:44.260]  you're gonna know that it's cannabis aphid that you have.
[14:45.140 --> 14:48.500]  Asexual reproduction is common for this insect,
[14:48.500 --> 14:51.020]  meaning that the female gives live birth
[14:51.020 --> 14:52.900]  to identical offspring.
[14:53.660 --> 14:57.060]  In addition to these non-winged forms,
[14:57.060 --> 15:00.580]  reproductive or winged forms can develop as well.
[15:00.580 --> 15:03.500]  You can kind of see these winged forms outdoors
[15:03.500 --> 15:04.980]  or in indoor situations
[15:04.980 --> 15:08.580]  where aphid populations are pretty dense.
[15:09.860 --> 15:12.540]  So unfortunately for management,
[15:12.540 --> 15:15.220]  females can produce several offspring per day.
[15:15.220 --> 15:19.780]  So populations can quickly skyrocket to high numbers
[15:19.780 --> 15:22.100]  in a very short amount of time.
[15:23.020 --> 15:26.180]  If you're producing outdoors and you see this insect,
[15:26.180 --> 15:28.980]  outdoor populations are highest later in the season,
[15:28.980 --> 15:30.820]  kind of close to harvest.
[15:30.820 --> 15:33.900]  And just reiterating again that since this insect
[15:33.900 --> 15:36.620]  reproduce reproduces primarily asexually,
[15:36.620 --> 15:38.900]  populations can increase very quickly.
[15:39.900 --> 15:42.540]  This insect can be found all throughout the plant.
[15:42.540 --> 15:46.540]  So that includes leaves, stems, and bud material.
[15:46.540 --> 15:48.060]  You'd see them a lot on stems
[15:48.060 --> 15:51.060]  and typically on the underside of leaves like in this photo.
[15:52.940 --> 15:55.180]  A risk with this insect is that
[15:55.180 --> 15:57.220]  as it moves through the plant and feeds,
[15:57.220 --> 15:59.300]  it excretes the substance called honeydew,
[15:59.300 --> 16:01.060]  which is a really sticky substance.
[16:01.060 --> 16:04.260]  And honeydew can lead to sooty mold formation,
[16:04.260 --> 16:06.140]  which is kind of the black looking stuff
[16:06.140 --> 16:08.500]  on the leaves in the photos.
[16:08.500 --> 16:11.940]  In addition, as the aphid molts and grows,
[16:11.940 --> 16:14.180]  it sheds exoskeletons.
[16:14.180 --> 16:16.300]  And these can get caught in the sooty mold,
[16:16.300 --> 16:18.300]  which is just really, really gross
[16:18.300 --> 16:20.060]  and not pretty to look at.
[16:20.100 --> 16:22.860]  And it leaves you with a sticky plant
[16:22.860 --> 16:25.860]  in addition to the normal stickiness of hemp.
[16:27.980 --> 16:30.300]  Something that we see from aphids and other plants,
[16:30.300 --> 16:32.260]  if you look at the photo on the top right,
[16:32.260 --> 16:35.100]  you can sometimes see yellowing, leaf curling,
[16:35.100 --> 16:38.220]  and wilting resulting from aphid feeding.
[16:38.220 --> 16:42.100]  This isn't typically, at least in my experience,
[16:42.100 --> 16:45.100]  not what we've seen with cannabis aphid.
[16:45.100 --> 16:47.460]  It can definitely still cause some yellowing
[16:47.460 --> 16:48.940]  and some slight leaf curling,
[16:48.940 --> 16:51.380]  but the photo on the left,
[16:51.380 --> 16:53.500]  the damage from this aphid isn't as bad
[16:53.500 --> 16:55.700]  as what you see, damage that you see
[16:55.700 --> 16:58.100]  from aphids and other crops.
[16:58.100 --> 17:00.220]  Again, just showing some photos,
[17:00.220 --> 17:04.020]  it can cause this sticky coating on plants
[17:04.020 --> 17:05.380]  due to the honeydew.
[17:06.500 --> 17:09.780]  And again, you can see that populations in these photos
[17:09.780 --> 17:11.620]  have quickly gotten out of hand.
[17:11.620 --> 17:14.860]  This is the really bad case of management.
[17:14.860 --> 17:18.020]  Same here, really bad situation with management.
[17:19.460 --> 17:21.980]  Just pointing out again that plants can be filled
[17:21.980 --> 17:24.340]  with aphids, but still retain their vigor.
[17:25.300 --> 17:27.380]  You definitely don't wanna see this.
[17:27.380 --> 17:31.100]  This is a bad lapse in judgment here
[17:31.100 --> 17:34.260]  where management was not taken early enough at all.
[17:34.260 --> 17:36.020]  And the plants are just sticky
[17:36.020 --> 17:40.020]  and filled with aphids and cast skins
[17:40.020 --> 17:43.140]  and just not very good.
[17:44.540 --> 17:48.380]  Yet again, more cases of bad management.
[17:48.820 --> 17:50.740]  So if you're producing outdoors,
[17:50.740 --> 17:53.420]  it's really important that you get rid
[17:53.420 --> 17:56.100]  of any leftover plant material in the field
[17:56.100 --> 18:01.100]  at the end of season, just because we're not sure
[18:01.100 --> 18:05.020]  what the cold tolerance of this insect is,
[18:05.020 --> 18:09.260]  but material left in fields can help sustain populations
[18:09.260 --> 18:10.540]  between seasons.
[18:11.620 --> 18:13.580]  Additionally, the good thing,
[18:13.580 --> 18:16.380]  natural enemies can aid management.
[18:16.380 --> 18:19.180]  You typically see lady beetles feeding on this aphid
[18:19.180 --> 18:21.020]  quite a lot outdoors.
[18:21.020 --> 18:24.260]  And there are other things like assassin bugs, damsel bugs,
[18:24.260 --> 18:29.260]  and then green lace nymphs that can help manage populations.
[18:30.060 --> 18:31.940]  So as far as management strategies,
[18:31.940 --> 18:35.540]  I can't say enough how important it is to scout outdoors.
[18:35.540 --> 18:38.940]  Make sure you're removing crop material at the season end
[18:38.940 --> 18:41.700]  and kind of let natural enemies do their thing.
[18:41.700 --> 18:43.580]  They'll help you with management.
[18:43.620 --> 18:45.420]  If you're outdoors, you really want to inspect
[18:45.420 --> 18:48.020]  any kind of plant material prior to introducing it
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.700]  into your operation.
[18:49.700 --> 18:52.220]  Make sure it's clean as you're starting.
[18:53.260 --> 18:56.020]  You can employ natural enemies as well.
[18:56.020 --> 18:58.580]  If you choose to use insecticides,
[18:58.580 --> 19:02.380]  consider using things like soaps, insecticidal soaps,
[19:02.380 --> 19:05.620]  neem oil, azadirachtin, or other biological products
[19:05.620 --> 19:08.820]  that are legal in the state where you're producing.
[19:08.820 --> 19:11.540]  I would suggest using pyrethrins as a last resort
[19:11.540 --> 19:14.580]  just because these can kill off natural enemies as well.
[19:15.740 --> 19:16.820]  Moving on.
[19:17.620 --> 19:19.220]  Oh, okay.
[19:19.220 --> 19:20.980]  Next up is two-spotted spider mite.
[19:20.980 --> 19:24.340]  So this is found pretty much everywhere as well.
[19:24.340 --> 19:27.700]  It's a generalist pest that can be,
[19:27.700 --> 19:30.140]  it's primarily present in indoor environments,
[19:30.140 --> 19:33.780]  but it can be outdoors as well in certain ranges.
[19:33.780 --> 19:36.300]  Likelihood of encounter, it's possible.
[19:36.300 --> 19:39.860]  It's not always a given that you're going to see this one.
[19:40.660 --> 19:43.420]  So like I said, it's a common pest indoors
[19:43.420 --> 19:45.500]  no matter what you're producing.
[19:45.500 --> 19:47.380]  Less frequently encountered outdoors,
[19:47.380 --> 19:50.860]  but it can be common in drier or more arid climates
[19:50.860 --> 19:52.780]  like the Western United States.
[19:53.620 --> 19:56.500]  It's big enough that you can see it with the naked eye.
[19:56.500 --> 19:58.420]  You don't need microscopy for it.
[19:58.420 --> 20:00.900]  And it is a mite, so it has eight legs.
[20:02.980 --> 20:05.140]  Two-spotted spider mites have these needle-like
[20:05.140 --> 20:06.980]  piercing, sucking mouth parts.
[20:06.980 --> 20:09.300]  So as they feed on hemp plants,
[20:09.740 --> 20:11.260]  they'll cause this stippling on leaves,
[20:11.260 --> 20:14.260]  which leaves these kind of dotted looking appearances,
[20:14.260 --> 20:17.580]  which is very typical of two-spotted spider mite feeding.
[20:18.540 --> 20:21.860]  Webbing is really common where populations are dense.
[20:21.860 --> 20:24.180]  These webs that they form are actively,
[20:24.180 --> 20:28.460]  are actually a protective measure to kind of keep them safe
[20:28.460 --> 20:30.180]  under the umbrella of this webbing
[20:30.180 --> 20:32.340]  so that they can continue reproducing
[20:32.340 --> 20:35.020]  and expanding their populations.
[20:36.020 --> 20:40.060]  You can see as well, just the kind of dirty looking
[20:40.060 --> 20:42.340]  appearance in both of these photos
[20:42.340 --> 20:44.260]  where there's nipplings of mites.
[20:45.180 --> 20:50.100]  Two videos to show you how it looks
[20:50.100 --> 20:52.660]  when their populations are really dense.
[20:52.660 --> 20:56.060]  This was shared from a grower in California.
[20:56.060 --> 20:58.020]  This is a pretty dense population.
[20:58.020 --> 21:00.220]  You can see all the little mites moving around
[21:00.220 --> 21:02.060]  in the video on the left.
[21:02.140 --> 21:06.260]  The video on the right, you can see the webbing
[21:06.260 --> 21:09.580]  on this kind of grouping of plants.
[21:09.580 --> 21:14.380]  Again, that's, you definitely want to implement
[21:14.380 --> 21:17.260]  some type of management before it gets to this point.
[21:18.980 --> 21:21.620]  So what are some strategies for management?
[21:21.620 --> 21:25.300]  Again, scouting is super important.
[21:25.300 --> 21:28.780]  It's important to inspect plants prior to introducing them
[21:28.780 --> 21:31.380]  and anywhere that you see an outbreak,
[21:31.380 --> 21:34.860]  maybe try to implement some form of management.
[21:34.860 --> 21:38.180]  Luckily due to data on this pest
[21:38.180 --> 21:41.260]  and other types of greenhouse production systems,
[21:41.260 --> 21:44.420]  we know that natural enemies work really well.
[21:44.420 --> 21:47.460]  One of the particular ones is Phytosceles persimilis.
[21:47.460 --> 21:48.860]  There are definitely others.
[21:48.860 --> 21:51.540]  I think this is just a really common one.
[21:51.540 --> 21:55.380]  Other species of predatory mites can aid management as well.
[21:55.380 --> 21:58.780]  Minute pirate bugs are really good for management here.
[21:58.820 --> 22:03.140]  If you use pesticides, insecticidal soaps or oils
[22:03.140 --> 22:05.620]  will work really well.
[22:06.740 --> 22:09.220]  All right, so next is hemp russet mite.
[22:09.220 --> 22:12.460]  This is another specialist similar to the cannabis aphid.
[22:12.460 --> 22:16.460]  It only feeds from cannabis sativa crops.
[22:16.460 --> 22:20.740]  In my experience, I've seen it indoors and outdoors.
[22:20.740 --> 22:23.420]  The likelihood of encounter, I say possible,
[22:23.420 --> 22:25.660]  I'll talk about this as we move through the section,
[22:25.660 --> 22:28.620]  but I think the most common situation here
[22:29.460 --> 22:31.660]  is that you get plant material or cuttings
[22:31.660 --> 22:33.300]  from an outside source.
[22:33.300 --> 22:36.980]  So that material comes already partially infested
[22:36.980 --> 22:39.940]  with these mites and they're really, really difficult
[22:39.940 --> 22:44.820]  to manage once you have them in your environment.
[22:44.820 --> 22:46.740]  So these mites are very small.
[22:46.740 --> 22:49.380]  Unlike the two-spotted spider mite,
[22:49.380 --> 22:52.020]  you can't see them with the naked eye.
[22:52.020 --> 22:54.860]  This is also a different type of mite.
[22:54.860 --> 22:57.420]  It's in the, I didn't note this on the last slide,
[22:57.420 --> 23:01.180]  but it's in a different family called Areophyidae.
[23:01.180 --> 23:02.620]  These are very, very small.
[23:02.620 --> 23:03.980]  They only have four legs.
[23:03.980 --> 23:06.500]  They use their four little legs to kind of pinch
[23:06.500 --> 23:08.940]  into the plant and hold themselves in place.
[23:10.500 --> 23:14.100]  You really need microscopy, or in some cases,
[23:14.100 --> 23:15.740]  if you have a really strong hand lens,
[23:15.740 --> 23:18.700]  that might work to help confirm presence,
[23:18.700 --> 23:21.340]  but I always highly recommend microscopes
[23:21.340 --> 23:24.620]  or some kind of something where you can see
[23:24.620 --> 23:27.780]  the plant material up really close.
[23:29.020 --> 23:31.580]  You can see this in the photo on the top left.
[23:31.580 --> 23:33.860]  The scale here is half a millimeter
[23:33.860 --> 23:35.540]  and they're even smaller than that.
[23:35.540 --> 23:37.860]  So for some kind of idea of scale.
[23:39.420 --> 23:41.460]  If you're on the East Coast, it's after lunch.
[23:41.460 --> 23:45.540]  If you're on the West Coast, it's lunchtime or just before.
[23:47.060 --> 23:49.980]  This is kind of what the mites can look like
[23:49.980 --> 23:53.700]  under the microscope, not zoomed in too much,
[23:53.700 --> 23:56.060]  but I always tell growers they look like,
[23:56.060 --> 23:58.260]  it's like you shredded Parmesan cheese
[23:58.260 --> 24:00.860]  or you sprinkled something on your pasta,
[24:02.060 --> 24:03.380]  not to ruin your appetite,
[24:03.380 --> 24:04.900]  but hopefully that will help you remember
[24:04.900 --> 24:06.620]  what they look like.
[24:06.620 --> 24:08.060]  Again, they're super tiny.
[24:08.060 --> 24:11.620]  These are photos of some aphids under the microscope.
[24:11.620 --> 24:13.780]  And where I have the arrows pointed,
[24:13.780 --> 24:16.220]  those are all little russet mites that got caught
[24:16.220 --> 24:19.100]  in the aphid in the process of doing this research project.
[24:19.100 --> 24:21.860]  So just for scale, they're really, really small.
[24:23.820 --> 24:27.980]  Mites prefer to infest developing buds.
[24:27.980 --> 24:32.300]  So developing or developed parts of the plant material.
[24:32.300 --> 24:35.020]  Their feeding can reduce the size and quality
[24:35.020 --> 24:38.140]  of future buds as the plant grows and develops.
[24:38.980 --> 24:43.300]  Where the mite has fed in these new and developing areas,
[24:43.300 --> 24:46.740]  there's usually a kind of just dirty or gray appearance
[24:46.740 --> 24:47.700]  where they fed.
[24:49.900 --> 24:51.180]  This can happen from,
[24:51.180 --> 24:53.460]  they're feeding from the surface of the leaf.
[24:54.220 --> 24:55.540]  They're getting rid of some of the chlorophyll
[24:55.540 --> 24:56.380]  in the leaf.
[24:56.380 --> 24:58.380]  So it just looks gray and drab
[24:58.380 --> 25:00.780]  and just sickly and dirty overall.
[25:01.860 --> 25:02.740]  As I've said,
[25:02.740 --> 25:06.340]  their feeding injury can lead to decreased bud density.
[25:06.340 --> 25:09.500]  This was from an indoor hemp facility in Virginia.
[25:09.500 --> 25:12.860]  They had a massive infestation of hemp russet mites.
[25:12.860 --> 25:15.700]  They managed to salvage the plants to an extent.
[25:15.700 --> 25:18.180]  I mean, this isn't a super attractive looking plant
[25:18.180 --> 25:20.340]  at this point, but, you know,
[25:20.340 --> 25:22.780]  it at least there's something there,
[25:22.780 --> 25:25.100]  but you can see where the density of the buds
[25:25.100 --> 25:26.420]  are drastically decreased.
[25:26.420 --> 25:29.580]  It's really patchy and not super uniform.
[25:29.580 --> 25:31.620]  Likely other things going on here as well,
[25:31.620 --> 25:34.180]  but the key infestation is hemp russet mite.
[25:35.820 --> 25:39.540]  Like I've said, it can be a problem both indoors and out.
[25:39.540 --> 25:42.620]  Issues can really arise from infested transplants.
[25:42.620 --> 25:44.460]  This was in a field setting.
[25:45.740 --> 25:49.340]  This one plant was really under the pressure
[25:49.340 --> 25:50.340]  of hemp russet mites.
[25:50.380 --> 25:53.220]  The ones around it weren't as bad.
[25:53.220 --> 25:56.260]  You know, also given these mites are so small,
[25:56.260 --> 25:58.900]  they can kind of easily disperse on wind.
[25:58.900 --> 26:00.900]  It just depends on the environment
[26:00.900 --> 26:04.060]  and what the weather is like basically.
[26:04.060 --> 26:05.980]  Here, you know, that didn't really happen.
[26:05.980 --> 26:08.180]  The population stayed pretty isolated,
[26:08.180 --> 26:10.860]  but it's worth knowing how small they are
[26:10.860 --> 26:15.020]  and how easily they can move when wind comes through.
[26:16.580 --> 26:18.780]  As I've said earlier too, with lots of mites,
[26:18.780 --> 26:21.820]  the plant material can look dirty or dusty.
[26:24.500 --> 26:26.300]  This is just a really dense population
[26:26.300 --> 26:27.500]  of hemp russet mites.
[26:27.500 --> 26:30.540]  The one on the right, it looks like it could be,
[26:30.540 --> 26:32.380]  it could have been dipped in dirt or something,
[26:32.380 --> 26:34.740]  you know, same for the photo on the top left.
[26:35.620 --> 26:38.100]  But if you had a microscope and were able to zoom in,
[26:38.100 --> 26:40.140]  this is actually what you see,
[26:40.140 --> 26:43.660]  a pretty heavy abundance of hemp russet mites.
[26:43.660 --> 26:45.260]  So kind of gross.
[26:46.420 --> 26:48.580]  I wanna point this out too.
[26:49.340 --> 26:54.340]  I think earlier on, one of the key thoughts
[26:54.580 --> 26:56.660]  about russet mite feeding and injury
[26:56.660 --> 26:59.780]  on hemp and cannabis and marijuana plants
[26:59.780 --> 27:02.700]  was that, you know, the most typical symptom
[27:02.700 --> 27:05.060]  was this leaf curling.
[27:05.060 --> 27:07.980]  That's definitely not always the case.
[27:07.980 --> 27:11.220]  Some cultivars will react in this way, but not all.
[27:11.220 --> 27:14.140]  So a good example is the photo on the left,
[27:14.140 --> 27:15.980]  mites were detected.
[27:15.980 --> 27:17.220]  On the photo on the right,
[27:17.260 --> 27:19.900]  there was a leaf curl and mites were not detected.
[27:19.900 --> 27:23.980]  Here again, mites were not detected on these plants.
[27:25.300 --> 27:27.500]  And here, this is leaves curling down.
[27:27.500 --> 27:29.220]  Mites were detected here,
[27:29.220 --> 27:31.300]  but you know, this is not always the case.
[27:31.300 --> 27:33.380]  So what I'm really trying to tell you here
[27:33.380 --> 27:36.300]  is that leaf curling is a lot of times
[27:36.300 --> 27:40.860]  just kind of a genetic response to some source of stress,
[27:40.860 --> 27:43.900]  whether on the plant or whether it's environmental.
[27:43.900 --> 27:47.420]  So leaf curling is not always indicative
[27:47.420 --> 27:49.620]  of a hemp russet mite infestation,
[27:49.620 --> 27:52.540]  but the key is that you should, you know,
[27:52.540 --> 27:54.980]  really invest in a microscope if this is a crop
[27:54.980 --> 27:56.820]  that you're planning to produce long-term
[27:56.820 --> 27:59.300]  because it can save you from these infestations.
[28:01.380 --> 28:03.540]  Again, scouting is really important.
[28:03.540 --> 28:06.100]  You know, if you're bringing material indoors,
[28:06.100 --> 28:07.780]  make sure you're inspecting this plant
[28:07.780 --> 28:10.420]  prior to introducing it into your environment.
[28:10.420 --> 28:13.220]  It's worth coordinating off a section as well
[28:13.220 --> 28:16.420]  for kind of quarantining this plant material
[28:16.420 --> 28:20.340]  before it's introduced to the rest of the operation,
[28:20.340 --> 28:23.340]  just in case you thought, you know, some mites,
[28:23.340 --> 28:26.460]  even a small population could increase pretty quickly.
[28:27.740 --> 28:30.460]  As far as other management tactics, natural enemies,
[28:30.460 --> 28:33.100]  we don't know of any at this point,
[28:33.100 --> 28:36.140]  or at least ones that would target this mite
[28:36.140 --> 28:39.020]  are not commercially produced and available.
[28:39.020 --> 28:41.180]  When it comes to pesticides,
[28:41.180 --> 28:44.540]  always check to see what the rules and regulations are,
[28:44.540 --> 28:46.940]  where you live and where you produce your crop,
[28:46.940 --> 28:51.180]  but data that we've seen so far,
[28:51.180 --> 28:54.980]  it seems like oils and sulfur work the best.
[28:55.860 --> 28:58.820]  I did not put the publication in this section,
[28:58.820 --> 29:01.620]  but I do have a published trial
[29:01.620 --> 29:03.860]  looking at hemp russet mite management.
[29:03.860 --> 29:06.620]  It's in the journal Arthropod Management Tests
[29:06.620 --> 29:07.660]  and it's open access,
[29:07.660 --> 29:11.020]  so if you search for it, you'll be able to find it.
[29:11.860 --> 29:13.180]  All right, moving on again.
[29:13.180 --> 29:15.060]  Next up is beet leafhopper,
[29:15.060 --> 29:18.060]  and I've kind of grouped other leafhoppers in here as well.
[29:19.060 --> 29:22.060]  This specific leafhopper, the beet leafhopper,
[29:22.060 --> 29:25.820]  is present only in the Western United States,
[29:25.820 --> 29:28.140]  but it's a big problem,
[29:28.140 --> 29:31.460]  so I've included it in this presentation.
[29:31.460 --> 29:33.580]  It's a generalist species.
[29:33.580 --> 29:35.620]  Hemp or cannabis or marijuana
[29:35.620 --> 29:38.820]  is not its preferred plant at all,
[29:38.860 --> 29:39.700]  but as outdoor production
[29:39.700 --> 29:41.900]  has increased over the past few years,
[29:41.900 --> 29:44.780]  we've definitely seen a lot of injury from this insect.
[29:45.900 --> 29:48.700]  Your risk level, I think it's very likely
[29:48.700 --> 29:51.460]  that you'll encounter this particularly
[29:51.460 --> 29:52.980]  and only particularly
[29:52.980 --> 29:55.620]  if you're in the Western United States.
[29:55.620 --> 29:58.700]  So there's a photo of it on the top and a photo of it here.
[29:58.700 --> 30:01.260]  It's a pretty nondescript looking leafhopper.
[30:02.820 --> 30:04.660]  If you see leafhoppers on your plant,
[30:04.660 --> 30:07.980]  you should at least note that they're there.
[30:09.260 --> 30:12.220]  These are photos that I got from Punia Natchapa.
[30:12.220 --> 30:15.660]  She is a professor at Colorado State University.
[30:15.660 --> 30:18.700]  She's done a lot of work with insect virus interactions
[30:18.700 --> 30:22.020]  and done a lot of work with this species in particular.
[30:22.020 --> 30:24.300]  And so this is a publication from her group,
[30:24.300 --> 30:26.460]  and these are all symptoms that resulted
[30:26.460 --> 30:30.460]  from beet leafhopper, or I'm sorry,
[30:30.460 --> 30:33.540]  beet curly top virus in the field,
[30:33.540 --> 30:36.140]  which is the virus that this leafhopper causes.
[30:36.140 --> 30:38.380]  So you can see things like fasciation,
[30:38.940 --> 30:40.220]  yellowing and hopper burn,
[30:40.220 --> 30:42.940]  distortion of leaves and even leaf curls.
[30:42.940 --> 30:44.460]  So like I was saying with russet mite,
[30:44.460 --> 30:47.100]  it's not always just a symptom of russet mite.
[30:47.100 --> 30:49.780]  It's a greater indicator of some type of stress
[30:49.780 --> 30:51.100]  to the plant overall.
[30:52.180 --> 30:57.180]  I think one of the key symptoms to this virus
[30:57.220 --> 31:01.020]  is this distortion and kind of leaf curling.
[31:01.020 --> 31:03.860]  As a scientist, it's really cool and really pretty to see,
[31:03.860 --> 31:07.940]  but as a grower, this is not good to see at all.
[31:07.980 --> 31:10.060]  The photo on the bottom left,
[31:10.060 --> 31:11.460]  you can see how this plant
[31:11.460 --> 31:13.500]  is just a little more yellowed overall.
[31:13.500 --> 31:16.780]  It's not this deep, healthy green like you wanna see,
[31:16.780 --> 31:20.660]  and there's hopper burn on the edges of these leaves.
[31:20.660 --> 31:24.100]  These photos were taken by me in California.
[31:24.100 --> 31:26.780]  This was in California this past summer as well,
[31:26.780 --> 31:28.340]  along the coast.
[31:28.340 --> 31:33.180]  This was, I thought, some pretty drastic symptoms
[31:33.180 --> 31:35.740]  of beet curly top virus.
[31:35.740 --> 31:40.620]  Again, just reiterating what this can do
[31:40.620 --> 31:43.220]  and what type of symptoms it can cause in the plant.
[31:44.140 --> 31:46.980]  Also from along the coast this year,
[31:46.980 --> 31:49.820]  by the end of the season, these plants are still alive
[31:49.820 --> 31:51.340]  and they had buds and stuff,
[31:51.340 --> 31:54.060]  but they just didn't look as good as the plants
[31:54.060 --> 31:57.780]  that didn't get this virus in the first place.
[31:57.780 --> 31:59.500]  It's just weird.
[31:59.500 --> 32:00.940]  We're still learning about this
[32:00.940 --> 32:02.580]  and we know that it's causing yield loss.
[32:02.580 --> 32:04.300]  We just haven't been able to quantify
[32:04.300 --> 32:06.780]  how much yield loss it's causing just yet.
[32:07.740 --> 32:09.380]  So in addition to beet leaf hopper,
[32:09.380 --> 32:13.220]  there are all kinds of leaf hoppers found throughout hemp.
[32:13.220 --> 32:15.660]  These are photos taken of specimens we've collected
[32:15.660 --> 32:19.060]  from a survey in California over the past two years.
[32:20.500 --> 32:22.660]  Still really unsure of what they're all doing
[32:22.660 --> 32:26.740]  and which ones are most, the biggest risk for us,
[32:26.740 --> 32:30.580]  but beet leaf hopper's one you really gotta watch out for.
[32:30.580 --> 32:33.100]  Here's what the insect looks like.
[32:33.100 --> 32:34.900]  They're really small insects.
[32:34.900 --> 32:36.340]  They move really quickly.
[32:36.340 --> 32:39.020]  The adult is on the left, nymph is on the right.
[32:39.020 --> 32:40.500]  The nymph just doesn't have wings.
[32:40.500 --> 32:43.260]  So it kind of scurries and walks along the leaf
[32:43.260 --> 32:45.820]  where the adult can just pop and fly away
[32:45.820 --> 32:47.660]  and get out of your way really quick.
[32:49.180 --> 32:52.460]  These are photos from a friend and colleague in the Midwest.
[32:52.460 --> 32:54.100]  So this is not beet leaf hopper,
[32:54.100 --> 32:56.460]  but again, it's reiterating these symptoms
[32:56.460 --> 32:58.660]  that leaf hoppers can cause to plants.
[32:59.500 --> 33:01.860]  This yellowing, distortion,
[33:01.900 --> 33:05.300]  this general just hopper burn on the edge of leaves.
[33:05.300 --> 33:08.420]  So it's just a weird thing that it causes.
[33:08.420 --> 33:10.420]  And like I've said, it's causing yield loss.
[33:10.420 --> 33:13.620]  We just haven't been able to quantify it yet.
[33:15.060 --> 33:17.620]  So management strategies here are pretty tough.
[33:18.620 --> 33:20.380]  In other crop systems,
[33:20.380 --> 33:23.180]  there's been research done over years and years.
[33:23.180 --> 33:26.580]  We know the resistant varieties or resistant cultivars
[33:26.580 --> 33:28.780]  in hemp and marijuana, cannabis,
[33:28.780 --> 33:31.140]  we don't know that at this time.
[33:31.180 --> 33:33.980]  Another strategy in other crops is seed treatments.
[33:35.180 --> 33:36.940]  We are not there for hemp.
[33:36.940 --> 33:41.220]  We likely will not be there for many years to come.
[33:42.100 --> 33:44.180]  So not an option for us right now either.
[33:44.180 --> 33:48.140]  When it comes to pesticides, this can be really challenging
[33:48.140 --> 33:53.060]  due to just the general nature of this insect.
[33:53.060 --> 33:55.500]  Like I showed you, the insect is really small.
[33:55.500 --> 33:57.380]  It moves, hops around,
[33:57.380 --> 34:00.260]  pops on and off of the plants really quickly.
[34:01.700 --> 34:04.420]  All it takes is them landing on the plant, feeding,
[34:04.420 --> 34:06.860]  and they can transmit the virus very quickly.
[34:06.860 --> 34:08.220]  So they don't have to live on it.
[34:08.220 --> 34:11.260]  They don't have to sit on it for hours at a time.
[34:11.260 --> 34:13.740]  They're there, they feed and they're gone.
[34:13.740 --> 34:15.940]  That's how quickly the virus can get to a plant.
[34:15.940 --> 34:20.340]  And once the virus is in it, it's not going to change.
[34:20.340 --> 34:21.780]  So with that said,
[34:21.780 --> 34:24.500]  I don't know that pesticides are even the best option
[34:24.500 --> 34:26.740]  just due to the nature of the insect
[34:26.740 --> 34:28.260]  associated with the crop.
[34:28.700 --> 34:32.260]  And even if insecticides were an option,
[34:32.260 --> 34:33.900]  I think the conventional products
[34:33.900 --> 34:35.460]  are the ones that would work better,
[34:35.460 --> 34:37.420]  something like a systemic insecticide,
[34:37.420 --> 34:41.460]  but that's not going to exist in hemp now
[34:41.460 --> 34:43.460]  or probably for the foreseeable future.
[34:43.460 --> 34:47.300]  So it's a challenge, but research is ongoing.
[34:48.780 --> 34:51.900]  The last key species that I want to talk about
[34:51.900 --> 34:53.900]  is rice root aphid.
[34:53.900 --> 34:57.300]  This is one we've seen and learned a little bit more about
[34:57.340 --> 35:00.180]  over the past couple of years.
[35:00.180 --> 35:02.540]  I think this is an everywhere pest as well.
[35:02.540 --> 35:03.780]  It's a generalist,
[35:03.780 --> 35:05.380]  meaning that it's not specifically
[35:05.380 --> 35:07.500]  targeting cannabis sativa crops.
[35:08.860 --> 35:12.420]  I think it can exist in crop systems outdoors,
[35:12.420 --> 35:17.340]  but the primary concern is in indoor production.
[35:17.340 --> 35:19.820]  In risk level, I've put moderate,
[35:20.700 --> 35:22.260]  this risk level that I've put on here
[35:22.260 --> 35:24.820]  is just my kind of general view of the problem.
[35:24.820 --> 35:26.420]  And I've put it at moderate
[35:26.460 --> 35:29.780]  because if you have it, it's likely to be an issue.
[35:29.780 --> 35:32.980]  But if you can maintain good sanitation,
[35:32.980 --> 35:34.780]  you may not end up seeing it.
[35:35.900 --> 35:39.020]  This has been a challenging species to study.
[35:39.020 --> 35:41.340]  Just the summer 2022,
[35:41.340 --> 35:44.420]  I tried several times to get a colony of these started
[35:44.420 --> 35:46.580]  to try and do something with research.
[35:46.580 --> 35:48.580]  They wouldn't cooperate.
[35:49.740 --> 35:52.220]  And that's the sentiment I've heard
[35:52.220 --> 35:54.580]  from other colleagues across the country
[35:54.580 --> 35:58.020]  that it's difficult to get these established
[35:58.020 --> 36:00.140]  to try and do further research on.
[36:00.140 --> 36:01.700]  So as the name suggests,
[36:01.700 --> 36:03.300]  they're primarily found in roots,
[36:03.300 --> 36:06.700]  as you can see in the two photos on the left.
[36:06.700 --> 36:11.060]  But a fairly recent paper from Whitney Crenshaw
[36:11.060 --> 36:12.940]  and Suzanne Wainwright Evans,
[36:12.940 --> 36:14.860]  and in conversations with Suzanne,
[36:14.860 --> 36:18.860]  we've learned that just because it's primarily a root aphid
[36:18.860 --> 36:20.540]  doesn't mean it's always in the roots.
[36:20.540 --> 36:22.740]  It can sometimes be seen on leaves and stems
[36:22.780 --> 36:25.140]  feeding more throughout the plant.
[36:25.140 --> 36:28.260]  I still, the primary region for concern is the roots.
[36:29.580 --> 36:31.500]  Here's another video from a grower.
[36:31.500 --> 36:32.900]  Now this, it's kind of blurry.
[36:32.900 --> 36:34.140]  It's moving kind of quickly,
[36:34.140 --> 36:36.940]  but if you focus on the green areas
[36:36.940 --> 36:39.340]  in the middle or top portion of the video,
[36:39.340 --> 36:43.140]  you can see where these aphids are concentrated
[36:43.140 --> 36:45.100]  along the roots of a plant.
[36:46.180 --> 36:49.180]  So as the name suggests, they really like the roots.
[36:49.180 --> 36:53.540]  Here again, they're found in the soil area of plants.
[36:54.660 --> 36:59.660]  So just alone, the fact that it's a root pest
[36:59.740 --> 37:02.020]  makes it a huge challenge.
[37:02.020 --> 37:04.340]  You know, scouting is always important.
[37:04.340 --> 37:06.580]  It's important here, but you know,
[37:06.580 --> 37:10.380]  my first instinct is not always to check the roots
[37:10.380 --> 37:12.180]  if the plant looks like it's dwindling.
[37:12.180 --> 37:15.740]  I, and assume many others might think
[37:15.740 --> 37:18.460]  that it's something else before assuming
[37:18.500 --> 37:20.140]  that it could be rice root aphid.
[37:21.940 --> 37:24.940]  As far as insecticides go,
[37:24.940 --> 37:27.380]  I think root drenches are the way to go.
[37:27.380 --> 37:30.940]  But again, I know I'm saying this with extreme caution
[37:30.940 --> 37:32.940]  and I've got the second bullet point on the slide
[37:32.940 --> 37:35.740]  kind of emphasizing that this is highly dependent
[37:35.740 --> 37:38.020]  on local and state regulations.
[37:38.020 --> 37:40.460]  And it's highly dependent on label language
[37:40.460 --> 37:42.700]  on the product that you're using.
[37:42.700 --> 37:45.820]  This is likely not allowed in a lot of locations,
[37:45.820 --> 37:49.060]  but it's, I guess, information that we know
[37:49.060 --> 37:51.900]  from seeing this pest in other types of crops
[37:51.900 --> 37:54.700]  where insecticide use like this would be allowed.
[37:54.700 --> 37:55.980]  So this one's a challenge,
[37:55.980 --> 37:59.940]  but I think it's a point to help you remember
[37:59.940 --> 38:04.100]  that sometimes there's stuff happening below the soil.
[38:04.100 --> 38:05.500]  You know, there's things in the roots,
[38:05.500 --> 38:07.740]  which is not always your first instinct
[38:07.740 --> 38:09.300]  when you're scouting for pests.
[38:10.300 --> 38:12.220]  So now for the rest of the PowerPoint,
[38:12.220 --> 38:15.300]  I've got some just kind of occasional species
[38:15.780 --> 38:18.980]  that I've seen grouped by chewing insects,
[38:18.980 --> 38:21.820]  piercing, sucking insects, and then root pests.
[38:21.820 --> 38:25.260]  These are things that are not that big of a problem,
[38:25.260 --> 38:28.020]  but they're things that you'll likely see
[38:28.020 --> 38:29.340]  either indoors or outdoors.
[38:29.340 --> 38:31.460]  So I just wanted to share some information
[38:31.460 --> 38:36.220]  and draw your attention to whether they're a concern or not.
[38:36.220 --> 38:38.700]  So for the chewing group, on this slide,
[38:38.700 --> 38:42.020]  I've just got the photo of yellow striped armyworm.
[38:42.020 --> 38:44.620]  There are all kinds of species of caterpillars
[38:44.660 --> 38:46.500]  that are going to be present in hemp
[38:46.500 --> 38:51.500]  and chew from leaves or sometimes stems and sometimes buds.
[38:51.900 --> 38:53.980]  I think most typically these other species
[38:53.980 --> 38:56.220]  are found feeding on leaves.
[38:56.220 --> 38:58.500]  In some certain or extreme conditions,
[38:58.500 --> 39:01.140]  they can be found feeding from bud material,
[39:01.140 --> 39:04.340]  but most likely going to be concentrated on leaves.
[39:04.340 --> 39:07.980]  These are things like armyworms, cutworms, and woolly bears.
[39:09.700 --> 39:13.020]  An application of BT would help these,
[39:13.020 --> 39:14.660]  would help knock these back.
[39:14.660 --> 39:17.060]  You know, I didn't really recommend BT for corn earworm
[39:17.060 --> 39:19.060]  just because we see a lot of resistance
[39:19.060 --> 39:22.660]  in outdoor situations, but for other caterpillars,
[39:22.660 --> 39:24.820]  BT seems to work a little bit better.
[39:26.140 --> 39:29.140]  There are going to be things like grasshoppers too.
[39:29.140 --> 39:30.780]  Depending on your location
[39:30.780 --> 39:33.420]  and depending on the infestation level
[39:33.420 --> 39:36.820]  or the type of crop surrounding your hemp crop,
[39:36.820 --> 39:38.940]  these can be a great risk
[39:38.940 --> 39:41.100]  or they can be kind of a lower risk.
[39:41.940 --> 39:43.780]  In extreme conditions, you know,
[39:43.780 --> 39:48.020]  they'll chew stems and cause plants to topple over.
[39:48.020 --> 39:51.980]  I think mature young plants are more vulnerable
[39:51.980 --> 39:55.700]  to grasshoppers than older or mature plants,
[39:55.700 --> 39:59.220]  but, you know, it's worth knowing about.
[39:59.220 --> 40:03.220]  I think these can be an extreme concern in rangeland areas
[40:03.220 --> 40:07.820]  or areas where there's more open area
[40:08.100 --> 40:11.620]  like you would typically see in the Western United States.
[40:11.620 --> 40:12.940]  These can be a challenge too,
[40:12.940 --> 40:15.380]  because any insecticide that would likely work
[40:15.380 --> 40:17.380]  to manage a grasshopper really well
[40:17.380 --> 40:19.340]  is likely not allowed in hemp.
[40:20.300 --> 40:22.620]  And the problem with biologicals
[40:22.620 --> 40:25.740]  and the products that are allowed in hemp is that,
[40:25.740 --> 40:28.460]  you know, there may not be as much of a residual
[40:28.460 --> 40:32.020]  or a persistent effect with that particular insecticide.
[40:33.380 --> 40:36.260]  So it's not going to aid the problem super well.
[40:37.140 --> 40:38.700]  There are lots of beetles.
[40:38.700 --> 40:41.420]  These are typically feeding from leaves.
[40:41.420 --> 40:44.100]  One in particular, the one in the middle,
[40:44.100 --> 40:47.260]  Southern corn rootworm or cucumber beetle,
[40:47.260 --> 40:48.460]  and other types of crops,
[40:48.460 --> 40:51.220]  these can transmit bacterial infections.
[40:51.220 --> 40:53.980]  Not seen anything like that happening in hemp yet,
[40:53.980 --> 40:57.180]  so not too worried about it right now.
[40:57.180 --> 40:59.780]  Again, they typically feed from leaf area,
[40:59.780 --> 41:01.980]  which loss of leaf surface area
[41:01.980 --> 41:06.260]  has not been of concern so far.
[41:06.260 --> 41:09.340]  Never seen any resulting yield loss or crop injury
[41:09.340 --> 41:10.860]  just from leaf feeding.
[41:12.020 --> 41:13.900]  We've also got flea beetles.
[41:14.940 --> 41:16.820]  These come and go.
[41:16.820 --> 41:18.940]  Sometimes you see them, sometimes you won't.
[41:18.940 --> 41:21.900]  They move really quickly like the leafhoppers.
[41:21.900 --> 41:23.300]  Their name is flea beetles,
[41:23.300 --> 41:27.220]  so they can hop very quickly from plant to plant.
[41:27.220 --> 41:30.060]  The typical type of crop injury here,
[41:30.060 --> 41:31.780]  again, is focused in the leaves,
[41:32.580 --> 41:35.140]  but you can kind of see it on the lower portions
[41:35.140 --> 41:37.700]  of the photo on the left,
[41:37.700 --> 41:39.620]  and then the photo on the bottom right.
[41:39.620 --> 41:42.820]  They cause this particular thing called shot hole damage.
[41:42.820 --> 41:44.340]  So it looks like, you know,
[41:44.340 --> 41:49.340]  if it's like a spray of little holes in the leaves.
[41:49.500 --> 41:51.580]  But again, loss of leaf surface area
[41:51.580 --> 41:54.460]  hasn't led to any type of plant damage
[41:54.460 --> 41:57.060]  or yield loss that we've seen so far.
[41:58.180 --> 42:00.940]  Other groups are scarab beetles.
[42:00.980 --> 42:03.860]  This is, I think, one of the more extreme cases
[42:03.860 --> 42:05.740]  of beetle feeding on a plant.
[42:05.740 --> 42:09.340]  This was from one of my PhD committee members.
[42:09.340 --> 42:11.420]  Just on a localized portion of the plant,
[42:11.420 --> 42:14.020]  they kind of skeletonized this leaf section.
[42:14.020 --> 42:17.580]  And even with this, you know, intense leaf loss,
[42:18.580 --> 42:19.620]  the plant was fine.
[42:19.620 --> 42:21.180]  It recovered super well.
[42:22.420 --> 42:23.660]  Same situation here.
[42:23.660 --> 42:26.180]  This was sent from a grower in North Carolina.
[42:28.380 --> 42:30.620]  Considerable portions of the leaf surface area
[42:31.300 --> 42:32.860]  can be removed and nothing really happens.
[42:32.860 --> 42:34.620]  So, you know, it's good to be on the lookout.
[42:34.620 --> 42:36.340]  It's good to know that this is happening,
[42:36.340 --> 42:38.020]  but I wouldn't freak out too much
[42:38.020 --> 42:39.340]  if we see this happening.
[42:40.220 --> 42:42.300]  Next is piercing sucking insects.
[42:42.300 --> 42:45.700]  So, you know, we've got other aphids,
[42:45.700 --> 42:48.020]  like tatoe aphid, green peach aphid,
[42:48.020 --> 42:50.500]  melon or cotton aphid.
[42:52.540 --> 42:54.900]  I think it's the similar case to cannabis aphid.
[42:54.900 --> 42:58.980]  They can feed, they can extract nutrients from the plant,
[42:58.980 --> 43:01.100]  but it's not really harming it
[43:01.100 --> 43:03.980]  like you would see in a typical type of horticultural crop.
[43:03.980 --> 43:06.340]  So either, whether it's cannabis aphid
[43:06.340 --> 43:08.820]  or other aphid species, you'll see them,
[43:10.060 --> 43:13.060]  you know, manage them if they get to considerable numbers,
[43:13.060 --> 43:14.540]  but I wouldn't freak out
[43:14.540 --> 43:18.180]  about these other aphid species too much.
[43:18.180 --> 43:20.020]  Other groups are stink bugs.
[43:20.020 --> 43:22.300]  There are different types of stink bugs
[43:22.300 --> 43:23.660]  or different species of stink bugs
[43:23.660 --> 43:25.340]  that you can see in plants.
[43:26.460 --> 43:28.420]  Also did not share the publication here,
[43:28.860 --> 43:30.900]  but one of my PhD research objectives
[43:30.900 --> 43:33.580]  was looking at stink bugs in hemp.
[43:33.580 --> 43:35.820]  And based on a study that we did,
[43:36.740 --> 43:40.260]  we caged stink bugs on buds of plants
[43:40.260 --> 43:43.100]  and didn't see any type of negative impact
[43:43.100 --> 43:47.420]  to the crop from stink bug presence or feeding.
[43:47.420 --> 43:50.740]  So just showing photos of stink bugs in the plants,
[43:50.740 --> 43:53.820]  not a cause for concern in my opinion.
[43:53.820 --> 43:55.940]  Same for ligus bugs.
[43:55.940 --> 43:57.500]  This one could cause some anxiety
[43:57.500 --> 43:58.580]  just because, you know,
[43:58.580 --> 44:03.580]  farnished plant bug is a highly injurious pest
[44:03.860 --> 44:05.940]  in crops like cotton.
[44:05.940 --> 44:08.460]  It can really reduce yields in cotton,
[44:08.460 --> 44:11.460]  but I've not seen anything like that in hemp either.
[44:11.460 --> 44:15.220]  In my experience, East Coast and West Coast,
[44:15.220 --> 44:17.180]  this insect can be present in crops
[44:17.180 --> 44:19.660]  from planting all the way to harvest,
[44:19.660 --> 44:22.900]  but I've never seen any kind of impact at all
[44:22.900 --> 44:23.740]  from their feeding.
[44:23.740 --> 44:25.820]  So that's good news for now,
[44:25.860 --> 44:28.980]  but it's definitely something to remain on the lookout for.
[44:30.220 --> 44:32.180]  Another group are chinch bugs.
[44:32.180 --> 44:34.820]  Same story here, no negative impact.
[44:34.820 --> 44:37.220]  You really more often see these concentrated
[44:37.220 --> 44:39.860]  on grain or seed variety hemp.
[44:39.860 --> 44:41.700]  They really like feeding from seeds,
[44:41.700 --> 44:43.820]  but even there, no noticeable impact
[44:43.820 --> 44:46.940]  to seeds or seed harvest.
[44:47.940 --> 44:49.820]  White flies.
[44:49.820 --> 44:53.580]  These are prevalent pretty much throughout the US.
[44:53.580 --> 44:57.740]  I've seen more of them during my time on the West Coast,
[44:57.740 --> 45:00.300]  but even in very dense populations,
[45:00.300 --> 45:03.740]  I've not seen any kind of, you know,
[45:03.740 --> 45:06.300]  really negative impact to the plant.
[45:07.260 --> 45:09.700]  The plant seems to do pretty fine
[45:09.700 --> 45:11.420]  with the presence of these.
[45:11.420 --> 45:14.900]  There is always concern that there could be risk of virus
[45:14.900 --> 45:16.460]  or pathogen transmission,
[45:16.460 --> 45:19.820]  but to date have not seen that occurring.
[45:21.460 --> 45:23.540]  Thrips, similar story here.
[45:24.380 --> 45:25.780]  There could be concern with these
[45:25.780 --> 45:28.860]  because they can transmit pathogens or viruses.
[45:28.860 --> 45:31.260]  Not seeing that be a problem.
[45:32.740 --> 45:36.380]  I think these can be a reason for concern,
[45:36.380 --> 45:40.780]  but to my knowledge and given my experience,
[45:40.780 --> 45:45.780]  I've not seen a crop suffer from thrips feeding or injury.
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.420]  Just more close photos of what they look like.
[45:50.420 --> 45:51.940]  Adult is on the left.
[45:51.980 --> 45:53.820]  The female version is on the right.
[45:53.820 --> 45:56.340]  And then here's what the adults look like.
[45:56.340 --> 45:57.380]  They're really, really small.
[45:57.380 --> 46:00.020]  So this is a super zoomed in photo.
[46:00.020 --> 46:03.340]  They have mouth parts called rasping, sucking mouth parts.
[46:03.340 --> 46:05.340]  Sounds really extreme.
[46:05.340 --> 46:08.340]  They can cause this stippling appearance on leaves as well.
[46:08.340 --> 46:11.700]  Kind of similar to spider mite feeding,
[46:11.700 --> 46:14.220]  but not exactly the same.
[46:15.540 --> 46:18.660]  Another mite is the broad mite.
[46:18.660 --> 46:20.980]  I unfortunately haven't seen this
[46:20.980 --> 46:25.100]  in hemp or marijuana or cannabis too much,
[46:25.100 --> 46:29.620]  but it's something that can happen.
[46:29.620 --> 46:31.220]  I've included this photo.
[46:31.220 --> 46:33.780]  It was a retroactive realization,
[46:33.780 --> 46:37.300]  but it seemed like this plant
[46:37.300 --> 46:39.100]  in an indoor growing environment
[46:39.100 --> 46:41.780]  may have had a little bit of broad mite damage,
[46:42.660 --> 46:46.020]  but not a ton of bad stuff going on.
[46:46.020 --> 46:49.060]  I don't know a lot about this one, unfortunately,
[46:49.060 --> 46:52.060]  but it's worth noting that it has been reported
[46:52.060 --> 46:54.220]  from hemp and cannabis crops.
[46:55.260 --> 46:57.900]  Next group are root pests.
[46:57.900 --> 46:59.860]  Other things are fungus gnats.
[47:01.460 --> 47:03.820]  I'm not saying that damage is exactly like that
[47:03.820 --> 47:06.180]  from rice root aphid,
[47:06.180 --> 47:08.900]  but it's at least worth having on your radar.
[47:08.900 --> 47:12.140]  These usually arise from improper sanitation
[47:12.140 --> 47:15.180]  or kind of really wet soil plants.
[47:15.180 --> 47:18.380]  It's just another one to kind of think about
[47:18.380 --> 47:20.500]  because we don't always think
[47:20.500 --> 47:22.380]  to inspect the roots first thing,
[47:22.380 --> 47:24.900]  but there can be stuff going on in the roots.
[47:26.300 --> 47:28.460]  Another group are fire ants.
[47:28.460 --> 47:33.460]  So this is from a colleague in the Southeast in Alabama.
[47:33.500 --> 47:35.780]  These can be a really big problem
[47:35.780 --> 47:37.620]  for outdoor crops down there.
[47:38.620 --> 47:39.940]  In addition to just the risk
[47:39.940 --> 47:41.820]  that they pose by being in the field,
[47:41.860 --> 47:43.780]  and I'm not talking to you as a grower
[47:43.780 --> 47:46.220]  or a worker walking through this field,
[47:47.460 --> 47:50.300]  this was kind of a surprise to learn about
[47:50.300 --> 47:54.780]  that they really target roots and stem portions of plants
[47:54.780 --> 47:59.220]  and can really cause damage in young plants.
[47:59.220 --> 48:01.460]  So young plants are the concern here.
[48:01.460 --> 48:06.180]  They'll feed from them and can cause a lot of plant loss.
[48:07.620 --> 48:10.420]  Another kind of surprise pest was termites.
[48:10.700 --> 48:13.660]  If you recall, hemp has kind of a woody stem.
[48:13.660 --> 48:15.420]  So this kind of makes sense.
[48:15.420 --> 48:17.300]  In all the cases and situations
[48:17.300 --> 48:19.980]  where I've seen or heard about termite damage,
[48:19.980 --> 48:22.940]  there's always been some kind of dead or decaying
[48:22.940 --> 48:26.780]  or rotting log or tree in the presence of the field.
[48:26.780 --> 48:29.420]  So this is what led to termite damage in hemp.
[48:30.780 --> 48:32.860]  Another group was wireworms.
[48:32.860 --> 48:34.980]  This is another root pest.
[48:34.980 --> 48:36.780]  You aren't really going to be aware
[48:36.780 --> 48:40.540]  that this is present in a field until it's too late.
[48:40.540 --> 48:43.780]  These worms exist in the soil,
[48:43.780 --> 48:46.540]  and once roots start to grow in the soil,
[48:46.540 --> 48:49.420]  they'll feed from the roots and can harm plants in that way.
[48:49.420 --> 48:53.420]  So this is a pest that you have to look for proactively
[48:53.420 --> 48:54.820]  in outdoor environments.
[48:56.300 --> 48:58.140]  Another is leaf miners.
[48:58.140 --> 49:01.540]  I've seen a lot of these on both coasts,
[49:01.540 --> 49:04.580]  and they make pretty art for you.
[49:04.580 --> 49:07.820]  I haven't seen any kind of negative impact other than that.
[49:10.780 --> 49:14.380]  One of the last ones to talk about is Eurasian hemp borer.
[49:14.380 --> 49:15.340]  There's not a lot.
[49:16.740 --> 49:19.540]  I guess this is one of the more historically reported pests
[49:19.540 --> 49:23.660]  from the era of fiber hemp production in the early United,
[49:23.660 --> 49:26.860]  or sorry, in the early era of hemp production
[49:26.860 --> 49:28.300]  in the United States.
[49:29.700 --> 49:33.780]  It's a borer, as the name suggests.
[49:34.220 --> 49:37.620]  It chews its way into the lower portion of the stem
[49:37.620 --> 49:39.780]  and bores its way up through the stem.
[49:41.220 --> 49:43.980]  As a larva, it has this really distinct orange
[49:43.980 --> 49:45.700]  or pink coloration.
[49:45.700 --> 49:47.980]  As an adult, the moth is really small,
[49:47.980 --> 49:52.980]  and it has this kind of face-looking arrangement
[49:53.420 --> 49:54.860]  on its wings.
[49:55.860 --> 49:58.780]  This, I think, is more common in the Midwest
[49:58.780 --> 50:01.500]  or areas where there was historical hemp production
[50:01.500 --> 50:05.580]  and where there still may be what we call feral hemp,
[50:05.580 --> 50:07.340]  hemp that just grows wildly.
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.980]  You're more likely to see it there.
[50:09.980 --> 50:13.780]  I haven't really seen it be a problem in Virginia
[50:13.780 --> 50:16.140]  or California in my experience thus far,
[50:16.140 --> 50:18.180]  but it's definitely one to know about.
[50:19.460 --> 50:21.260]  And the last one I wanted to talk about
[50:21.260 --> 50:23.180]  is another type of historical pest,
[50:23.180 --> 50:25.660]  the European corn borer.
[50:25.660 --> 50:28.900]  This one as well bores into the stem of crops.
[50:28.900 --> 50:31.060]  I was really, really kind of worried about this
[50:31.620 --> 50:34.660]  as a pest until I saw it firsthand in the field
[50:34.660 --> 50:35.860]  a few years ago.
[50:36.740 --> 50:39.340]  It definitely bores into plants.
[50:39.340 --> 50:40.820]  This was a cannabinoid hemp plant
[50:40.820 --> 50:42.340]  where all these photos came from,
[50:42.340 --> 50:47.300]  but it might've harmed a little section of the plant,
[50:47.300 --> 50:50.820]  but it didn't knock out the whole plant entirely.
[50:50.820 --> 50:53.180]  So it's still one to watch for.
[50:53.180 --> 50:55.660]  And if you see holes on the plant
[50:55.660 --> 50:57.820]  or this kind of sawdust-looking appearance,
[50:57.820 --> 51:00.780]  like in the bottom middle photo,
[51:01.460 --> 51:02.580]  it could indicate that there's some type
[51:02.580 --> 51:04.420]  of boring situation happening,
[51:04.420 --> 51:08.820]  but it's not the most common.
[51:08.820 --> 51:13.420]  And for European corn borer and Eurasian hemp borer,
[51:13.420 --> 51:17.060]  this is not, don't have a lot of management strategies
[51:17.060 --> 51:17.900]  for these.
[51:17.900 --> 51:19.660]  And even if we had insecticides,
[51:19.660 --> 51:24.020]  they're very difficult to control.
[51:24.020 --> 51:26.940]  So that's all I have for the pest groupings,
[51:26.940 --> 51:29.420]  but I wanted to at least mention pesticides
[51:29.460 --> 51:31.620]  before we wrap up today.
[51:31.620 --> 51:34.300]  So I've repeated it with every pest
[51:34.300 --> 51:36.780]  throughout the presentation,
[51:36.780 --> 51:39.780]  but pesticides are federally regulated.
[51:39.780 --> 51:43.660]  The EPA has direct oversight of this.
[51:43.660 --> 51:46.220]  However, individual states have been left
[51:46.220 --> 51:48.540]  with the task of deciding what pesticides
[51:48.540 --> 51:52.380]  can be applied to hemp or cannabis or marijuana crops,
[51:52.380 --> 51:54.020]  if that's what you're working in.
[51:56.340 --> 51:59.300]  There's a lot of self-responsibility that comes here,
[52:00.180 --> 52:02.820]  which can be very challenging if you're a producer,
[52:02.820 --> 52:05.820]  but the biggest thing I can tell you
[52:05.820 --> 52:09.260]  is make sure you're reading the label thoroughly
[52:09.260 --> 52:11.020]  before you apply any product
[52:11.980 --> 52:15.420]  and make sure it's feasible via label language
[52:15.420 --> 52:18.060]  or a list put out by your state
[52:18.060 --> 52:19.460]  for you to apply the product.
[52:19.460 --> 52:20.620]  It's very important.
[52:20.620 --> 52:22.420]  And one other thing you could do
[52:22.420 --> 52:25.020]  is kind of talk to your producer or your buyer
[52:25.020 --> 52:27.500]  to see what opinions they may have
[52:27.500 --> 52:30.620]  as far as products that you might use or apply on the crop.
[52:32.180 --> 52:33.740]  Just, I'm based in California.
[52:33.740 --> 52:37.740]  I thought that our language regarding pesticide use
[52:37.740 --> 52:39.420]  was pretty digestible,
[52:39.420 --> 52:43.820]  and I thought I would at least share what our situation is.
[52:43.820 --> 52:47.380]  So this goes for cannabis or marijuana in California.
[52:49.300 --> 52:51.300]  If the active ingredients found in the product
[52:51.300 --> 52:54.580]  are exempt from tolerance, residue tolerance requirements
[52:54.580 --> 52:55.700]  and from registration,
[52:55.700 --> 53:00.700]  so that would be designated as a 25B insecticide or pesticide
[53:02.020 --> 53:05.260]  or exempt from residue tolerance requirements,
[53:05.260 --> 53:08.020]  and use of the product is not legally in conflict
[53:08.020 --> 53:11.180]  with the label, which I think is the more important,
[53:11.180 --> 53:13.220]  always making sure that whatever you're using
[53:13.220 --> 53:15.700]  is not in legal conflict with the label.
[53:16.660 --> 53:20.060]  And for hemp, the only extra requirement here
[53:20.060 --> 53:24.060]  is that the product is actively registered for use on hemp.
[53:24.060 --> 53:25.940]  And what that might look like,
[53:25.940 --> 53:29.580]  this is just a product I know that has hemp on the label.
[53:29.580 --> 53:33.140]  This is the name of the product, active ingredients.
[53:33.140 --> 53:35.740]  Here's some label language regarding what crops
[53:35.740 --> 53:38.020]  this product could be used in.
[53:38.020 --> 53:40.180]  And this is a situation where hemp
[53:40.180 --> 53:41.940]  is explicitly on the label.
[53:41.940 --> 53:45.140]  So as long as this pesticide is registered in your state
[53:45.140 --> 53:47.260]  and it's legal for use in your state,
[53:47.260 --> 53:49.180]  you can apply it to your hemp crop.
[53:50.180 --> 53:55.180]  So thanks for participating and for joining this talk today.
[53:56.740 --> 53:58.700]  As you've learned, there are many species
[53:58.700 --> 53:59.900]  that are observed in hemp.
[53:59.900 --> 54:02.500]  Some of them are pests, some of them are beneficials,
[54:02.500 --> 54:04.700]  and some of them are just feeding for a little bit
[54:04.700 --> 54:07.180]  before they're moving on to the next crop.
[54:07.180 --> 54:09.220]  We've got some management strategies
[54:09.220 --> 54:11.460]  and some knowledge at this point,
[54:11.460 --> 54:13.300]  but it's important to remember
[54:13.300 --> 54:15.780]  that this is still a very new crop.
[54:15.780 --> 54:18.020]  Even though it's been legal for several years,
[54:18.460 --> 54:22.260]  it's still very new in the American landscape.
[54:22.260 --> 54:27.260]  And as a representative of a university,
[54:27.900 --> 54:31.100]  we're slowly making steps to conduct more research
[54:31.100 --> 54:31.980]  with these things.
[54:31.980 --> 54:35.980]  And as we are able to conduct more research,
[54:35.980 --> 54:37.980]  we'll learn more management strategies
[54:37.980 --> 54:41.660]  and we'll know better how to handle these situations
[54:41.660 --> 54:44.140]  with more time and with more experience.
[54:45.140 --> 54:48.780]  And the last thing I'll say is the most important cornerstone
[54:48.780 --> 54:52.180]  to managing pests, whether it's an insect or a mite
[54:52.180 --> 54:55.580]  or a pathogen or a weed is the economic threshold.
[54:55.580 --> 54:58.020]  So the economic value of your crop
[54:58.020 --> 55:00.340]  determines every management decision.
[55:00.340 --> 55:01.820]  With hemp, this is challenging
[55:01.820 --> 55:04.020]  because the market is really unstable
[55:04.020 --> 55:07.300]  and it's still developing and research is ongoing.
[55:07.300 --> 55:10.500]  So I'm hopeful that in the years to come,
[55:10.500 --> 55:12.740]  we'll have economic thresholds for these pests
[55:12.980 --> 55:16.780]  and this crop, but it's still a work in progress.
[55:16.780 --> 55:19.540]  So to close, everything that I said,
[55:19.540 --> 55:23.500]  I think can be pretty much found in this publication
[55:23.500 --> 55:24.820]  from a few years ago.
[55:24.820 --> 55:29.420]  I'm an author on this along with colleagues from Colorado,
[55:29.420 --> 55:32.100]  Tennessee, and me in Virginia,
[55:32.100 --> 55:34.420]  but this is kind of the first stab
[55:34.420 --> 55:37.660]  we took at explaining the situation,
[55:37.660 --> 55:40.460]  kind of explaining the pest complex
[55:40.460 --> 55:41.660]  and not just pest complex,
[55:41.660 --> 55:44.380]  but other things that you would see in the crop.
[55:44.380 --> 55:47.860]  So I still think this is a paper that's really helpful.
[55:47.860 --> 55:50.180]  It's with the Journal of Integrated Pest Management.
[55:50.180 --> 55:51.220]  It's open access.
[55:51.220 --> 55:54.540]  So if you find this online, you'll be able to read it.
[55:54.540 --> 55:55.380]  I think it's helpful
[55:55.380 --> 55:58.340]  and it kind of reiterates what I said today.
[55:59.420 --> 56:03.300]  Another thing, Whitney Cranshaw has been
[56:03.300 --> 56:06.540]  basically an encyclopedia of knowledge on this topic.
[56:07.660 --> 56:09.860]  Everything that I've learned from my experience
[56:09.860 --> 56:12.500]  and my research can be,
[56:13.380 --> 56:16.460]  there's more information on particular pests here.
[56:16.460 --> 56:17.980]  So I would encourage you to check out
[56:17.980 --> 56:21.380]  the Colorado State Hemp Insect page
[56:21.380 --> 56:25.060]  for more information on hemp insects and mites.
[56:25.060 --> 56:28.540]  And then lastly, there's a million people to thank
[56:28.540 --> 56:30.460]  for help with this, but these are just some,
[56:30.460 --> 56:32.420]  I wanted to give a shout out to.
[56:32.420 --> 56:35.420]  Whitney, like I said, Suzanne Wainwright-Evans,
[56:35.420 --> 56:36.940]  the photo on the top right,
[56:36.940 --> 56:40.340]  and the photo in the top middle is my postdoc advisor
[56:40.340 --> 56:42.780]  and colleague, Saul Alba.
[56:44.660 --> 56:48.740]  Their help in exposing me to issues
[56:48.740 --> 56:50.180]  that are occurring in real time
[56:50.180 --> 56:52.380]  has been really, really, really helpful.
[56:52.380 --> 56:56.540]  So with that, I am done
[56:56.540 --> 57:01.500]  and I'm happy to take any questions that might come.
[57:01.500 --> 57:04.900]  So we can check the chat and the Q&A now.
[57:04.900 --> 57:07.260]  Yeah, it was a fantastic presentation, Katie.
[57:07.260 --> 57:08.100]  Thank you.
[57:08.100 --> 57:09.780]  We have several questions in the Q&A,
[57:09.780 --> 57:12.500]  so feel free to read them out loud.
[57:13.780 --> 57:14.820]  Okay, let's see.
[57:14.820 --> 57:18.900]  The first thing I see is research attached to entomologists
[57:18.900 --> 57:21.700]  like Professor Chris Carlton at LSU have claimed
[57:21.700 --> 57:24.740]  that predatory mites have proved successful
[57:24.740 --> 57:26.180]  against hemp russet mites
[57:26.180 --> 57:28.700]  and cultivators have reported success
[57:28.700 --> 57:30.500]  using species like euchymeras,
[57:30.500 --> 57:33.540]  but this seems to be contentious with other reports.
[57:33.580 --> 57:35.940]  Is there research about this to be published
[57:35.940 --> 57:37.940]  that is more conclusive?
[57:37.940 --> 57:41.260]  At this time, I don't know of anything,
[57:41.260 --> 57:44.580]  and I think I said it during the hemp russet mite section
[57:44.580 --> 57:45.420]  when I was talking,
[57:45.420 --> 57:49.300]  but what we know so far is at least the mites
[57:49.300 --> 57:53.100]  that are commercially produced are not really working,
[57:53.100 --> 57:55.420]  and that's kind of what I know right now.
[57:55.420 --> 57:57.700]  If more information comes out,
[57:57.700 --> 58:00.860]  I would make sure it's from a reputable source,
[58:01.860 --> 58:03.540]  like a peer-reviewed publication
[58:03.540 --> 58:07.620]  or something that's been peer-reviewed.
[58:07.620 --> 58:08.700]  So good question.
[58:10.340 --> 58:11.180]  Next question.
[58:11.180 --> 58:15.580]  On average, how many eggs do the female corn earworm lay?
[58:15.580 --> 58:20.500]  It appeared she deposited a single egg in each location.
[58:20.500 --> 58:23.100]  So she can lay a lot of eggs.
[58:23.100 --> 58:26.540]  I'm not sure of the exact value off the top of my head,
[58:26.540 --> 58:30.700]  but it's worth noting that she does lay eggs singly.
[58:31.340 --> 58:34.100]  So one at a time wherever she lays them,
[58:34.100 --> 58:36.260]  but she can lay multiple in a night.
[58:37.700 --> 58:42.180]  What type of application for the corn earworm insecticide?
[58:42.180 --> 58:45.020]  Can I use it in my drip system or foliar?
[58:45.020 --> 58:46.260]  That's a great question.
[58:47.180 --> 58:52.180]  So any product that's currently labeled for use in hemp
[58:53.180 --> 58:56.420]  is going to be a foliar type of application
[58:56.820 --> 59:01.580]  with systemic or drip insecticides.
[59:01.580 --> 59:06.580]  I believe those are more systemic and nothing like that,
[59:06.980 --> 59:09.860]  at least at this current point is labeled for use in hemp.
[59:09.860 --> 59:12.900]  So it would be a foliar type of application.
[59:12.900 --> 59:14.380]  And it's worth noting as well
[59:14.380 --> 59:17.980]  that a lot of the products labeled for hemp
[59:17.980 --> 59:19.940]  are biological in nature.
[59:19.940 --> 59:22.100]  So they have a biological active ingredient
[59:22.100 --> 59:26.380]  or they're more organic production type of products,
[59:27.620 --> 59:30.900]  which kind of means that they don't have
[59:30.900 --> 59:32.700]  a strong residual effect.
[59:32.700 --> 59:34.300]  So anything that you apply
[59:34.300 --> 59:36.740]  is going to need to be continuously applied.
[59:36.740 --> 59:38.980]  You can't just apply it once and be done.
[59:41.060 --> 59:42.260]  Let's see.
[59:42.260 --> 59:45.220]  You say cannabis aphid only feeds on cannabis.
[59:45.220 --> 59:47.220]  What do you mean by feed?
[59:47.220 --> 59:50.140]  Dr. Punia Nachapa has shown that the cannabis aphid
[59:50.180 --> 59:52.940]  can spread viruses to potato through feeding.
[59:52.940 --> 59:54.580]  So they do feed on other plants.
[59:54.580 --> 59:57.540]  Perhaps they are not able to complete their life cycle
[59:57.540 --> 59:58.700]  on other plants.
[59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.620]  Erin thinks that's a really great point.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.380]  You're entirely correct.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.820]  I get used to saying things one way
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.340]  and this is what I need to kind of help me remember
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.740]  to say them the right way.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.620]  Yes, out of Punia's lab,
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.860]  there is a paper showing that cannabis aphid
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:19.300]  can transmit potato virus Y to potatoes.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:22.660]  So it can feed on potatoes to transmit this virus.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.380]  However, you're exactly right.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.020]  That's a better way to say it.
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.500]  It's not that it exclusively feeds on cannabis crops.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.740]  It's that it needs cannabis crops to complete its life cycle
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.500]  and develop and continue its life cycle.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.460]  So good, thanks for pointing that out.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.300]  Does neem oil have insecticidal qualities
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:47.220]  or does it work more like a horticultural oil?
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:50.900]  Neem definitely has insecticidal qualities.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.500]  Are other leafhoppers a problem in the Eastern US?
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:01.220]  So things we've seen so far are potato leafhopper.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.340]  That's the only one I know of specifically.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.220]  There can be other species,
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:12.220]  but as far as transmitting viruses
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.980]  like beet curly top virus from beet leafhopper,
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.220]  I am not sure.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.300]  I just know that it's not as much of a frequent problem
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.940]  in the Eastern United States
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.900]  as beet leafhopper is to the Western United States,
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.140]  if that makes sense.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.580]  Erin again, are there sulfur products allowed for use
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.460]  on hemp as an insecticide?
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.460]  I think that is a question where it's going to depend
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.980]  on products allowed for use from state to state.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.980]  I don't even want to say what states may allow it
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.900]  because I'm not sure,
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.220]  but I believe I've seen it on some state specific lists.
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.740]  Again, if not sulfur, then consider a type of oil product
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.180]  which may also be on a state specific list.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.940]  I'll reiterate again, anytime you apply a product
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.740]  or you're uncertain about its legality
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.540]  or potential for use in a hemp or cannabis crop,
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:15.260]  I would consult your county extension agent in California,
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.580]  your county agricultural commissioner,
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.260]  resources like that who could give you
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.300]  a more direct answer than I could.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.780]  Have you evaluated till versus no till cultivation
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.100]  as a way to mitigate rice root aphid infestation?
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.300]  That's a good question.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.300]  So till versus no till would be more
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.860]  of an outdoor type of situation.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.260]  It can exist outdoors,
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.980]  but I don't think it's as big of a problem outdoors.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.980]  So I'm not, like, I don't know that this would be something
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:56.500]  to explore with rice root aphid at the current time
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.500]  until or unless it becomes a greater problem outdoors.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:05.460]  Aaron again, thanks Aaron, you're asking awesome questions.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.060]  With hemp being federally legal,
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:10.340]  my understanding is that pesticides are regulated federally
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.300]  by the EPA and not at a state level.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.140]  When you talk about state differences,
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.780]  are you talking about high THC cannabis?
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.780]  Yes and no, I guess.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.100]  Hemp is a federally legal crop now,
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.500]  but I, no, that's a good question.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:36.420]  Maybe state specific use isn't as big of a deal anymore
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.860]  since it is federally legal
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:41.980]  and products are either going to have it on the label
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.300]  or not, but a lot of that is because it takes,
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.060]  like it takes so much time to alter the language
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.260]  on a pesticide label.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.060]  And I know that companies have to go through a lot of hoops
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.740]  to get hemp added.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.900]  So maybe for that reason,
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.460]  states may still have some type
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.220]  of state specific use list for hemp,
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.380]  but that's definitely a thing for high THC cannabis
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.500]  like you're asking,
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.420]  which is what I was referring to
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.940]  with the sulfur question earlier.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:16.740]  So the ultimate conclusion I can give is that
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:19.980]  it just depends always no matter what.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:25.860]  Can you discuss incidences of microbial insecticides
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.820]  causing inflorescences to fail compliance testing
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.460]  in ways in which cultivators can utilize these controls
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.780]  while maintaining compliance?
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.140]  That's a great question.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.300]  I have heard stories of this happening.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.740]  I don't have a specific story.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.260]  I guess I've heard a situation where someone has told me
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.580]  they know of growers that this has happened to.
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.460]  It can definitely happen.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:56.900]  My suggestion would be, if you can afford it,
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:00.900]  maybe testing a small section or testing a couple buds
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.820]  before doing a complete harvest
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:08.660]  or applying it in enough time that the microbial presence
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.940]  may be reduced by the time you harvest the crop.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.980]  That's the best advice I can give there.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.940]  And the last question, can sulfur products affect pH?
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.780]  I do not know the answer to that.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.460]  Luis, I don't know if you have any ideas on that,
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.180]  but I do not know.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.940]  And I guess I should say,
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.780]  I think there's different schools of thought
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:40.300]  whether sulfur or oils may do better
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.020]  at managing russet mites on hemp.
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.100]  A lot of it depends on experience
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:50.100]  and who you're talking to and experience.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.540]  So that's all I can offer right now.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:54.980]  But thanks for the questions.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.020]  These were all really good.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.580]  Erin, thanks for all the great questions.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.940]  I hope the explanations were helpful.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.060]  Yeah, thank you, Katie.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.140]  Thank you everyone for joining us today.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.500]  And yeah, that was a fantastic presentation, Katie,
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.180]  and as well as the Q&A.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.580]  So everyone, please join us in two weeks,
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.220]  on April 5th for our sixth webinar,
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.940]  focused on hemp pathogens.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.660]  So yeah, thank you everyone.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.740]  Thank you, Katie.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.780]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.700]  Awesome, okay.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.340]  Yeah, most people have left,
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:33.820]  but someone asked another question,
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.460]  which is kind of a comment saying that,
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.500]  yeah, it's a really good point.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.700]  States can and do put more restrictive use on pesticides
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.180]  than the federal oversight.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.700]  States like California, New York,
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.220]  and Florida do so regularly.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.300]  Yeah, that's an excellent point.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:52.300]  It's not always more liberal than the federal viewpoint.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.420]  Sometimes it's more strict.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.460]  So good point, okay.
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:03.110]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:06.110]  on the web at cornell.edu.
