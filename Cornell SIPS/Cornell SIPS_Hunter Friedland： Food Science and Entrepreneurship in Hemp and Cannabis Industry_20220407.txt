[00:00.120 --> 00:07.620]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.740 --> 00:13.020]  Hello, everyone. Welcome to Hemp 411.
[00:13.020 --> 00:19.420]  We are so thrilled that you all have joined us today.
[00:19.620 --> 00:22.660]  My name is Zach Stancel.
[00:22.660 --> 00:28.100]  I am the USDA Hemp Germplasm Curator.
[00:28.100 --> 00:31.020]  We're based in Geneva, New York.
[00:31.020 --> 00:34.740]  There's a little bit of sunlight and a little bit of warmth here,
[00:34.740 --> 00:37.700]  so spring is coming in Geneva.
[00:38.540 --> 00:44.580]  What we do here is we run a seed library for hemp.
[00:44.580 --> 00:48.020]  We collect hemp from all over the world,
[00:48.020 --> 00:55.620]  store it, grow it out in our greenhouses, and collect seeds.
[00:55.620 --> 00:59.580]  We gather a lot of data about those different varieties of hemp,
[00:59.580 --> 01:03.900]  and then we make those different varieties available
[01:03.900 --> 01:08.220]  to the hemp research community for free.
[01:08.220 --> 01:13.420]  We're trying to conserve the genetic diversity of hemp
[01:13.420 --> 01:17.540]  and then make that available to help science and industry
[01:17.540 --> 01:23.780]  and a whole cadre of different people who are working with hemp.
[01:24.660 --> 01:30.300]  We hope that our work here will allow these universities, companies,
[01:30.300 --> 01:37.260]  farmers, and really everyone to benefit from hemp in the next 10, 20, 30 years.
[01:37.260 --> 01:40.740]  Also, while we've been doing this work,
[01:40.740 --> 01:45.180]  we've met so many awesome, brilliant, creative people
[01:45.180 --> 01:49.180]  across the whole spectrum of hemp.
[01:49.220 --> 01:55.420]  We really want to share them and their knowledge with you.
[01:55.420 --> 02:00.420]  I want to tell you about Hunter Friedland, who is our speaker today.
[02:00.420 --> 02:04.460]  Hunter is the founder and CEO of Serona Labs,
[02:04.460 --> 02:09.620]  which he started while he was studying at Cornell University.
[02:09.620 --> 02:15.180]  After conducting a study of the hemp supply chain in New York State
[02:15.180 --> 02:18.460]  in conjunction with the National Science Foundation,
[02:18.460 --> 02:25.740]  he saw an opportunity to develop a higher standard for cannabinoid ingredients.
[02:25.740 --> 02:30.580]  Since then, he has assembled a world-class team of top scientists
[02:30.580 --> 02:34.660]  and consumer packaged goods experts
[02:34.660 --> 02:38.420]  and successfully secured initial fundraising rounds
[02:38.420 --> 02:42.660]  to ensure the company is set up for long-term growth.
[02:42.660 --> 02:45.300]  Hunter is passionate about the cannabis industry
[02:45.340 --> 02:52.340]  and is dedicated to help building an innovative and equitable industry in New York.
[02:52.340 --> 02:58.060]  In addition to his role as the CEO of Serona Labs,
[02:58.060 --> 03:04.780]  he has recently assumed the Processing and Manufacturing Committee Chair role
[03:04.780 --> 03:09.460]  for the New York Cannabis Growers and Processors Association.
[03:09.460 --> 03:13.420]  Without further ado, I bring you Hunter.
[03:13.420 --> 03:17.780]  Thanks so much. It's a pleasure to meet everybody and thank you for having me.
[03:17.780 --> 03:20.940]  So yeah, today, I'm going to talk a little bit about food science
[03:20.940 --> 03:25.180]  and entrepreneurship in the hemp and cannabis industry,
[03:25.180 --> 03:28.300]  give you a little bit of a background of how I started the company,
[03:28.300 --> 03:32.300]  kind of where we're at today and some of the pain points that are posed in the industry.
[03:32.300 --> 03:34.020]  I'm going to keep this pretty casual,
[03:34.020 --> 03:37.100]  so feel free to kind of ask questions during the lecture
[03:37.100 --> 03:40.940]  and I'll try to get to them during the lecture or after.
[03:40.940 --> 03:49.500]  So yeah, without further ado, I'll start by just talking a little bit about functional beverages.
[03:49.500 --> 03:52.980]  I think this is a good way to kind of give everybody a general background of,
[03:52.980 --> 03:55.340]  you know, the history of the industry, where it started,
[03:55.340 --> 03:58.460]  where we think it's going with the emergence of cannabinoids
[03:58.460 --> 04:03.660]  as a really great functional ingredient to create new specific mood states.
[04:03.660 --> 04:07.540]  So, you know, generally functional beverages is a large market, right?
[04:07.540 --> 04:12.420]  You can see here, estimated that it's going to be almost a $400 billion global market
[04:12.420 --> 04:18.420]  by the end of next year, with 56% of consumers having tried products that are trying to,
[04:18.420 --> 04:24.580]  beverage products that are trying to focus on specific health conditions or specific mood states.
[04:24.580 --> 04:30.180]  You know, the way that we look at this market is really starting with the emergence of Red Bull in the energy category.
[04:30.180 --> 04:35.860]  So in the late 90s and the early 2000s, Red Bull, you know, was the first player in this market,
[04:35.860 --> 04:42.420]  started in Thailand, was brought by, I believe a Dutch company or German company to Europe,
[04:42.420 --> 04:46.100]  and really started in nightclubs where people started using Red Bull.
[04:46.100 --> 04:53.300]  And then a major consumer packaged goods company came to Europe, saw how this product was doing,
[04:53.300 --> 04:55.340]  and started to bring that to the US.
[04:55.340 --> 05:02.260]  And since then, functional beverages and energy drinks make up a huge, huge category in the US.
[05:02.260 --> 05:08.660]  Around that time, you saw the emergence of vitamin water, where you have vitamins in beverages, protein beverages,
[05:08.660 --> 05:13.460]  you know, this, you know, now with kombucha and stick packs, things like liquid IVs,
[05:13.460 --> 05:17.780]  you're seeing the development of this category, starting where, you know, consumers are looking for,
[05:17.780 --> 05:22.180]  you know, mood states and really functional ingredients and products that, you know,
[05:22.180 --> 05:24.980]  have different uses for different times of the day.
[05:24.980 --> 05:27.180]  So, you know, that's kind of where we're at today.
[05:27.340 --> 05:31.340]  As this market starts to emerge, you've seen startups enter the space,
[05:31.340 --> 05:38.860]  as well as major consumer packaged goods companies like Molson Coors and Pepsi and Constellation, you know, jump in.
[05:38.860 --> 05:43.580]  So, you know, over the past few years, as the cannabis industry has gained more steam,
[05:43.580 --> 05:51.020]  and CBD has gained more regulatory clarity, you've started to see, you know, an emergence of CBD and other cannabinoids
[05:51.020 --> 05:54.140]  as a functional ingredient to drive mood states.
[05:54.220 --> 06:01.980]  So, you know, we're, again, like we talked about before, products like Red Bull and protein, protein drinks are used for specific things.
[06:01.980 --> 06:06.300]  You know, cannabinoids have the ability to, you know, early days in terms of research,
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.700]  but have the ability to drive these specific mood states.
[06:08.700 --> 06:12.700]  For example, CBD being more of a general wellness ingredient,
[06:12.700 --> 06:18.300]  you're starting to see the emergence of research around minor cannabinoids, cannabinoid like CBN,
[06:18.300 --> 06:24.780]  that is thought as potential use cases for sleep, or CBG, which is thought to have use cases for energy,
[06:24.780 --> 06:26.780]  you know, in conjunction with these other ingredients.
[06:26.780 --> 06:33.580]  So, you know, as this category starts to evolve, we're going to see, you know, major companies like the Constellations and Pepsi's and Coke's
[06:33.580 --> 06:39.260]  in this world start to use these ingredients to drive, again, more mood state specific products.
[06:39.260 --> 06:44.140]  But right now, the landscape of cannabinoid infused beverages is mostly startups.
[06:44.140 --> 06:50.220]  You're starting to see some of the larger consumer packaged goods in companies enter the space.
[06:50.220 --> 06:54.460]  But due to, you know, what I'll talk about a little bit later, the regulatory environment today,
[06:54.460 --> 07:00.460]  you know, the major multinational CPGs are not really, you know, pushing forward in this space just yet.
[07:01.660 --> 07:06.380]  So, yeah, right now, I'll just kind of give a little bit of a background of how I started the company,
[07:06.380 --> 07:12.380]  you know, where we're at today, and then kind of go through our team and talk more about our specific
[07:12.380 --> 07:16.060]  pain points that we're solving in the marketplace, where customers are,
[07:16.060 --> 07:17.820]  you know, what's different about what we do.
[07:18.460 --> 07:25.180]  But, you know, again, I'm Hunter Friedland. I started this company in early to mid 2018,
[07:25.180 --> 07:30.700]  while I was a senior at Cornell University, starting getting involved in industry,
[07:30.700 --> 07:35.660]  you know, kind of by happenstance, a few people in my life, my girlfriend's grandfather,
[07:35.660 --> 07:40.540]  my dad's friend had hemp farms across New York and one in Oregon.
[07:41.180 --> 07:47.580]  So I started learning about the industry is all pre 2018 farm bills are pretty early days in space,
[07:47.580 --> 07:51.580]  but started learning about the space start to see that there look like a lot of opportunity,
[07:51.580 --> 07:55.020]  and generally a lot of interesting opportunities in the space.
[07:55.660 --> 08:00.780]  So started pushing forward started, ultimately reaching out to a few professors at the university,
[08:00.780 --> 08:05.420]  that's where I got in touch with Larry Smart, as well as a professor called Ali Abasour,
[08:06.060 --> 08:11.020]  who worked in the research department and the emulsion science lab at Cornell.
[08:11.020 --> 08:14.460]  So that was really my introduction to you know, what is happening on the science side,
[08:14.460 --> 08:18.620]  and where are the main pain points. So from connecting with the university,
[08:18.620 --> 08:23.580]  it was around the same time that applications for the second round of hemp processing licenses
[08:23.580 --> 08:29.980]  opened up in New York State. So we ultimately applied for one of these licenses and again,
[08:29.980 --> 08:35.500]  late 2018 and you know, started kind of pushing forward. You know, at that point,
[08:35.500 --> 08:40.380]  after we made that application, we applied and got into the National Science Foundation
[08:40.380 --> 08:45.500]  iCorps program. So that whole program was about solving pain points and working with
[08:46.380 --> 08:50.700]  unique technology and how you bring that to market and what are the real pain points that
[08:50.700 --> 08:54.460]  we're solving. At that point, you know, we were really early in the development of the company,
[08:55.020 --> 08:59.340]  and the initial business model was all around extraction. So we started pushing forward and
[08:59.340 --> 09:03.500]  really connecting with anybody in the market that would have a conversation with us across
[09:03.500 --> 09:08.380]  the supply chain, but particularly the licensed hemp farmers in New York. So we talked and had
[09:08.380 --> 09:12.940]  conversations with the vast majority of hemp farmers in New York State. We did 20 minute
[09:12.940 --> 09:17.340]  interviews to understand really what were their pain points, everything at the time from just a
[09:17.340 --> 09:22.460]  general lack of infrastructure, right, everything from drying, to then extraction, to then, you
[09:22.460 --> 09:27.580]  know, actually sales points, you know, got a really good overview of who the players were in the
[09:27.580 --> 09:34.140]  market, and where we could drive value to the marketplace. So shortly after that, the Farm Bill
[09:34.140 --> 09:41.420]  passed, and that made hemp legal in all 50 states, at least at the beginning of that transition. So
[09:41.420 --> 09:46.300]  that was a really exciting moment. And shortly after the passing of the Farm Bill, we received
[09:46.300 --> 09:52.300]  one of the few licenses to process hemp under the Research Partnership Agreement in New York State.
[09:52.300 --> 09:57.980]  I graduated a few months after that, and just myself started kind of going to conferences,
[09:57.980 --> 10:02.380]  and, you know, again, keeping pushing forward to see where do we fit in in this marketplace.
[10:02.380 --> 10:07.580]  And initially, after, you know, doing the NSF I-Corps program, we determined that extraction
[10:07.580 --> 10:12.300]  was a major pain point in the market, right? It was very limited infrastructure in New York State,
[10:12.300 --> 10:17.340]  and kind of acting as this clearinghouse, taking hemp farmers product and turning them into a usable
[10:17.340 --> 10:23.180]  ingredient for a variety of consumer packaged goods products, seemed like the best place to
[10:23.180 --> 10:27.980]  start to build a business. But after a few months of going to conferences, really getting a bigger
[10:27.980 --> 10:31.820]  understanding of what does the market look like beyond just New York State, but really across the
[10:31.820 --> 10:37.900]  US, we saw that extraction was starting to become more of a commodity business. There was no real
[10:37.900 --> 10:42.700]  IP that we could develop around that side of the supply chain. And we started to take the pivot
[10:42.700 --> 10:49.340]  towards formulation, which I'll talk a lot about, you know, in this lecture today. But that was
[10:49.340 --> 10:53.740]  around the time that I met two of my three co-founders, I'll talk a little bit more about
[10:53.740 --> 10:59.740]  after this, but Nick, who is a PhD in food science from Cornell, who formerly worked at Canopy Growth,
[10:59.740 --> 11:04.220]  one of the largest cannabis companies in the world, joined the company, and we started kind of
[11:04.220 --> 11:09.820]  pushing them towards formulation, where there's a general big problem with cannabis. Cannabis in
[11:09.820 --> 11:15.020]  general by nature is an oil, and oil and water don't mix. So how do you create products like
[11:15.020 --> 11:21.900]  beverages or confectionery products that during the manufacturing process have mainly a water base?
[11:21.900 --> 11:27.100]  So we kind of pushed towards that and started developing solutions around, you know, really
[11:27.100 --> 11:33.260]  spray-dried powders and emulsion technology, which the basic concept is taking a big oil particle
[11:33.260 --> 11:39.340]  and making it a really small, stable nano emulsion. And I'll talk more specifically about
[11:39.340 --> 11:44.220]  these pain points as we move forward, but started, you know, pushing towards that problem in the
[11:44.220 --> 11:52.540]  market, ended up raising our first round of funding, where that was the end of 2020, where we raised our
[11:52.540 --> 11:59.180]  first round and got up and running out of our lab in Geneva, New York. We are located in the Cornell
[11:59.180 --> 12:04.780]  Tech Farm, which is Cornell's kind of incubation space for food and ag startups, and that's where
[12:04.780 --> 12:13.020]  our whole business is based today. So with that said, I will start to move to the next slide and
[12:13.020 --> 12:18.620]  just talk a little bit more about our team, and then we'll talk more about the business. But,
[12:18.620 --> 12:23.820]  and I gave you guys generally my background. I went to Cornell, I studied hospitality, so it didn't
[12:23.820 --> 12:31.180]  come from the agriculture or the hardcore sciences, but I studied the hospitality business in school,
[12:31.180 --> 12:36.860]  graduated and started, you know, started this business. But Nick is also Cornellian. He has a
[12:36.860 --> 12:45.580]  food science PhD from Cornell. He graduated in 2009, I believe, and after his PhD, he went to
[12:45.580 --> 12:50.700]  work for a company called Constellation Brands. Constellation Brands is one of the largest beverage
[12:50.700 --> 12:56.460]  alcohol companies in the U.S. that owns and distributes brands like Corona Beer or Robin
[12:56.780 --> 13:02.300]  Wines. He worked there for about eight years in research and development, and after his tenure
[13:02.300 --> 13:08.060]  for there, Constellation made a large investment company called Canopy Growth, which at the time
[13:08.060 --> 13:14.540]  was the largest Canadian cannabis company in the world. And Nick was tapped as the first person to
[13:14.540 --> 13:20.300]  run their R&D department, so he led the team that commercialized the first CBD and THC beverages
[13:20.300 --> 13:26.140]  in the Canadian market, as well as launching their general 2.0 cannabis product. So products
[13:26.380 --> 13:32.540]  like edibles and vapes and infused pre-rolls and topicals. So that was kind of Nick's background.
[13:32.540 --> 13:36.620]  Did that for three years and then joined us as a co-founder in the business.
[13:37.340 --> 13:42.140]  Alan joined around the same time. Alan's our chief operating officer. He comes from a food,
[13:42.140 --> 13:47.500]  beverage, and alcohol background, working mainly for a company called Lidestri Food & Drink,
[13:47.500 --> 13:53.100]  which is based out of Rochester, New York. Lidestri is one of the largest contract manufacturers in
[13:53.100 --> 13:58.220]  the US, meaning they manufacture products for a variety of different brands and companies. So a
[13:58.220 --> 14:03.900]  company like Pepsi could go to a company like Lidestri and have them manufacture a variety of
[14:03.900 --> 14:09.500]  their SKUs. And I think that's kind of a misconception that people see in the CPG
[14:09.500 --> 14:14.060]  industry that all these companies are manufacturing their own products, but they're actually these
[14:14.060 --> 14:19.660]  businesses called co-packers that manufacture for a variety of different companies and create a much
[14:19.660 --> 14:25.180]  more efficient supply chain that way. So Alan worked at Lidestri for around 25 years,
[14:25.180 --> 14:30.380]  ended up running a $350 million division there where he ran the whole co-packing division,
[14:30.380 --> 14:35.820]  worked with companies like Gorilla, Heinz, Pepsi, Monster, and et cetera throughout his career,
[14:36.620 --> 14:41.500]  left, worked in private equity for a few years, and then joined us as the chief operating officer.
[14:42.780 --> 14:47.500]  And he's a co-founder and the four of us, including LJ, are the four co-founders. And LJ
[14:47.500 --> 14:53.100]  is the candy man, we like to call him. His family was the Fuera Pan Candy Company, which
[14:53.100 --> 14:59.100]  was one of the largest candy companies in the US before they exited in 2017. The company owned and
[14:59.100 --> 15:05.340]  operated brands like Lemonheads, Fireball, Trolli Gummy Bear, Black Forest Gummy Bear. At the time
[15:05.340 --> 15:11.180]  of exit, they represented 70% of the gummies on the shelf in the convenience store besides
[15:11.180 --> 15:18.380]  Haribo. So really one of the global players in the candy industry. So after 30 years there,
[15:18.380 --> 15:24.060]  they exited to Ferrero, the makers of Nutella. And then LJ started making investments in the
[15:24.060 --> 15:30.380]  cannabis industry. He went out to California and ran an edible stick company out there before
[15:30.380 --> 15:35.580]  joining us as the chief innovation officer. So those are the four co-founders in the company.
[15:35.580 --> 15:39.900]  I'll quickly go through the rest. At this point, we're a small, kind of close-knit team,
[15:39.900 --> 15:44.780]  but really, which I'll emphasize, really hiring the best is critical when building a business,
[15:44.780 --> 15:50.700]  particularly in this industry. So quickly, Cam is the chief commercial officer. He also comes from
[15:50.700 --> 15:56.380]  Canopy Growth. He worked in a variety of marketing and sales roles at major CPG companies like
[15:56.380 --> 16:02.220]  Molson Coors and Kellogg's before ending up at Canopy, where he ran their beverage department
[16:02.780 --> 16:09.100]  on the marketing and sales side. Saul is a PhD chemist. He worked in the pharmaceutical industry
[16:09.100 --> 16:15.580]  after his PhD and then went to work with Canopy Growth under Nick, working there for four years
[16:15.580 --> 16:24.220]  before joining us. Xavier, or X, is our director of business development. He comes from LA and
[16:24.220 --> 16:30.700]  worked in Silicon Valley for five or six years in business development roles and sales roles across
[16:30.700 --> 16:36.220]  a variety of venture-backed startups from the incubator called Y Combinator. And after doing
[16:36.220 --> 16:41.660]  those sales and business development roles, he ended up launching his own CBD beverage in late
[16:41.660 --> 16:47.900]  2018. That company ultimately failed, but learned a tremendous amount by being one of the first CBD
[16:47.900 --> 16:54.300]  beverages to launch into the market. And X runs BizDev as well as all of our social impact
[16:54.300 --> 17:02.540]  initiatives. So that is the team. So yeah, now we'll just talk a little bit more specifically
[17:02.540 --> 17:10.460]  about what we do as a part of the supply chain at Sirona Labs. And I'll talk briefly about our
[17:10.460 --> 17:15.100]  parent company, Kingsroad Holdings, where we're expanding into the more traditional cannabis
[17:15.100 --> 17:21.580]  market in New York. But starting from kind of get-go, it all starts with the seed. You have
[17:21.580 --> 17:25.660]  your genetics that drive what product you're producing, whether the genetics are going to
[17:25.660 --> 17:30.620]  determine the use of hemp for plant or cannabis plant, a variety of different genetics that
[17:30.620 --> 17:36.060]  perform better in certain environments. And this is something that George and Larry's team can
[17:36.060 --> 17:41.500]  tell you about a lot more intelligently than I can, but that's where it all starts. So after the
[17:41.500 --> 17:47.660]  seeds are grown into a plant, the plants are harvested, and then in our case, collected for
[17:47.660 --> 17:55.500]  biomass where they're dried, harvested, and then sent to the processor. So we're going to sit in
[17:55.500 --> 18:00.540]  that processing side of the supply chain. Initially, and today, we sit right after the
[18:00.540 --> 18:07.180]  actual extractor. But after the biomass is harvested, the biomass goes to an extractor
[18:07.180 --> 18:13.660]  where it's extracted for its active oil. So the cannabis is used in a variety of different
[18:13.660 --> 18:17.740]  extraction methods, but the most popular, at least in the hemp side, being ethanol.
[18:17.740 --> 18:24.220]  So the solvent is used to extract the active product, in this case CBD or THC or
[18:24.220 --> 18:32.060]  CBN, from the plant material into a more concentrated oil format. Then it goes through
[18:32.060 --> 18:36.700]  a distillation process to create a distillate. At that point, you can either use that as your
[18:36.700 --> 18:42.140]  core input or isolate, which is an isolated cannabinoid. So kind of taking the full spectrum
[18:42.140 --> 18:47.420]  product, meaning the full essence of the plant, including its terpenes and the variety of
[18:47.420 --> 18:52.700]  cannabinoids that are present in the plant material, or isolating one specific cannabinoid,
[18:52.700 --> 18:59.340]  which in most cases right now in the hemp industry is CBD. So that's kind of where we come in
[19:00.060 --> 19:06.220]  as a formulator in this space. So we take the inputs being isolated or distillate and convert
[19:06.220 --> 19:12.380]  that into a water dispersible product where we have IP, which is kind of our unique formulation,
[19:12.380 --> 19:18.060]  in conjunction with the active product. We emulsify it and to create, again, these very small
[19:18.780 --> 19:24.380]  nanoparticles that are then used to create stable and efficacious ingredients for water-based
[19:24.380 --> 19:30.620]  products in the industry. We have two kind of inputs, it's either a spray-dried powder or a
[19:30.620 --> 19:35.900]  liquid emulsion. So once you have your input ingredient, whether that being a distillate or
[19:35.900 --> 19:40.940]  a water-soluble product like we produce, you get into the commercialization and manufacturing
[19:40.940 --> 19:45.500]  process, right? When you're taking these ingredients and manufacturing a variety of products
[19:45.500 --> 19:53.420]  like beverages or gummies or vapes, and that is kind of what that co-packing business is.
[19:53.420 --> 19:59.900]  And today we're only doing the formulation work, but as we move into the New York
[19:59.900 --> 20:05.180]  adult-use cannabis market, we are opening up a cannabis manufacturing facility where we will
[20:05.180 --> 20:10.140]  actually manufacture the end products for these other brands, similar to the business I mentioned
[20:10.140 --> 20:16.300]  before that Allen operated called the Destry. So it's, again, scaled manufacturing, operating as an
[20:16.300 --> 20:22.300]  efficient operator to bring costs down for a variety of the brands in the market by producing
[20:22.300 --> 20:28.700]  in one single facility. So after the manufacturing process, then you move to retail where products
[20:28.700 --> 20:36.700]  are then sold, in the case of CBD, a variety of different places from online to big box
[20:36.700 --> 20:42.700]  retailers or convenience stores, or on the cannabis side of the market, strictly being sold at dispensaries,
[20:44.700 --> 20:50.620]  at licensed dispensaries. So let's move on to the next slide.
[20:52.300 --> 20:57.580]  So I will kind of talk generally about the challenges on our side of the marketplace,
[20:57.660 --> 21:02.940]  right? When you're taking, again, a distillate and turning it into a water-soluble product,
[21:02.940 --> 21:08.780]  at the end of the day, we're servicing food and beverage products, and taste is king, right? If a
[21:08.780 --> 21:14.620]  product doesn't taste good, consumers really do not want to use that product. And by nature,
[21:14.620 --> 21:20.140]  cannabis is a really bitter product and really bitter ingredient. So that's a challenge that
[21:20.140 --> 21:26.460]  we've pushed to solve in creating an ingredient that can be efficacious, and we'll talk about
[21:26.460 --> 21:34.140]  in a second, but has limited to no taste at higher dosages in the product. So taste is a
[21:34.140 --> 21:41.020]  very, very important aspect of this industry. Inconsistent efficacy, right? I think I've heard,
[21:41.020 --> 21:46.380]  I've said that word efficacy for a while, but what does that mean in conjunction to this
[21:47.260 --> 21:54.940]  market? And really comes down to two terms, onset time and bioavailability, right? How fast does this
[21:55.020 --> 22:00.300]  ingredient get into the bloodstream once it's consumed, and at what level does it get into the
[22:00.300 --> 22:07.100]  bloodstream? Because you can have, for example, let's just say a thousand milligrams of CBD in an
[22:07.100 --> 22:12.620]  end product, but if that CBD doesn't actually get into the blood, it's not having an effect
[22:13.900 --> 22:20.780]  for that person, that use case. So efficacy is critical, and this, again, something that we've
[22:20.780 --> 22:25.580]  solved and proven by hard data, which I'll talk about later as we've shown through our
[22:25.580 --> 22:33.580]  pharmacokinetic studies. Compatibility is the next piece, right? As I mentioned, cannabis by nature
[22:33.580 --> 22:39.900]  is an oil, an oil and water don't mix. So how do you create a product that is stable? Meaning
[22:39.900 --> 22:44.060]  once we've created our emulsion, how does that emulsion then stay into the beverage
[22:44.860 --> 22:49.740]  or water-based product for a long period of time without separating? The easiest way to kind of
[22:49.740 --> 22:55.900]  visualize this is a salad dressing, right? You see the oil and the base of the salad dressing
[22:56.940 --> 23:02.940]  separated, but as you mix it and shake it, it becomes homogeneous. But pretty quickly,
[23:02.940 --> 23:08.460]  leaving it on the shelf, maybe after 10, 20, 30 minutes, an hour, it goes back to where it was
[23:08.460 --> 23:14.700]  before where the oil and base are separated. So that's a huge problem in this space. You're
[23:14.700 --> 23:19.660]  creating an ingredient that is supposed to be an emulsion, be able to be mixed into water,
[23:20.140 --> 23:25.580]  then is being put into and packaged in a can, for example, you can't have that product separate over
[23:25.580 --> 23:29.980]  time because then you're going to have an oil slick at the top of the beverage. And it's not
[23:29.980 --> 23:36.460]  a nice experience for the consumer and it's less efficacious product. So stability and compatibility
[23:36.460 --> 23:45.900]  are key to kind of expand upon that, how we build our emulsions is by custom based on the product
[23:45.900 --> 23:52.220]  type. So for example, a coffee versus a tea versus seltzer water all have different chemistries by
[23:52.220 --> 23:57.980]  nature of the product. So one emulsion isn't necessarily going to work for all of those
[23:57.980 --> 24:03.020]  different product types. So that's again, how we produce our emulsions here at Strone and
[24:03.020 --> 24:08.940]  a big differentiator, but I will talk more to that as the presentation goes on. You know, the last
[24:08.940 --> 24:14.860]  two pieces are poor appearance, having a very cloudy emulsion is something that is not as
[24:14.860 --> 24:19.740]  appealing for the consumer. So how do you create a product that is completely translucent,
[24:20.380 --> 24:27.260]  but also has a minimal taste for the end consumer? And then lastly is scientific validation.
[24:28.940 --> 24:33.580]  Particularly a lot of our competitors in the space kind of talk through how fast onset time,
[24:33.580 --> 24:39.020]  how great their efficacy is, but there really is no evidence to back that up. So that's something
[24:39.020 --> 24:44.780]  that we take really seriously here at the company and truly backing our ingredients by science,
[24:45.260 --> 24:50.300]  and I will be showing you the results from our first pharmacokinetic study where we dosed rats
[24:50.300 --> 24:55.340]  and tested the bloodstream over certain intervals to prove how quickly the onset time was and what
[24:55.340 --> 25:00.700]  the bioavailability of our ingredients is compared to basic products on the market.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.400]  So just kind of giving a little bit larger view of what our solutions are, I mentioned before,
[25:10.400 --> 25:16.080]  we have two products, a liquid emulsion and a spray dried powder. You know, the main features
[25:16.080 --> 25:21.200]  are water solubility, meaning it can mix into water and stay stable. They're fast acting.
[25:21.840 --> 25:27.680]  They have high bioavailability and something unique about our ingredients from a label point
[25:27.680 --> 25:33.440]  of view is that we have no preservatives in our products. We kind of hit multiple applications
[25:33.440 --> 25:38.320]  with their ingredients from beverages to powdered mixes to topical products,
[25:38.960 --> 25:43.440]  edibles, tinctures, and pet products. So a wide range of product types
[25:43.440 --> 25:47.600]  that we can power as an ingredient supplier in this space.
[25:50.160 --> 25:55.040]  So, you know, talking more specifically about our science and how the process works,
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.320]  as I mentioned before, we start with our active input, call it a distillate or an isolate.
[26:00.320 --> 26:05.760]  Once that hemp or cannabis extract is acquired in the facility, we mix that with our proprietary
[26:05.760 --> 26:10.800]  blend of emulsifiers and surfactants. That is kind of what our IP covers. You know, at this
[26:10.800 --> 26:17.040]  point, we're not patent pending. And after taking that mixture of your emulsifiers and surfactants,
[26:17.040 --> 26:23.120]  in addition to the active hemp material, you then use a variety of different processes,
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.760]  but the basic concept is high pressure where you're taking, you know, a machine,
[26:27.760 --> 26:33.760]  there's a diamond tip and really high pressure to break these particles into really, really small
[26:33.760 --> 26:39.520]  particles while they're mixed with the unique base to then create your nano emulsion, right?
[26:39.520 --> 26:44.800]  So taking something from a really big particle into millions of really small nanoparticles that
[26:44.800 --> 26:51.360]  can now be easily mixed into a water-based product, as well as having, you know, a faster onset time,
[26:51.360 --> 26:59.840]  as I've mentioned before. So talking a little bit more about our pharmacokinetic study, you know,
[26:59.840 --> 27:05.920]  again, we really strive to have real evidence behind our ingredients here, both from a stability
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.600]  point of view, but also from a bioavailability and onset time view. So, you know, what we did
[27:11.600 --> 27:18.080]  last year is we worked with a CRO, which is a clinical research organization. We work with them
[27:18.080 --> 27:24.720]  to dose rats with our ingredient and test their blood at certain intervals. So if you can see on
[27:24.720 --> 27:33.360]  my screen, the dark blue line is our emulsion. The light blue line is what we call a basic emulsion,
[27:33.360 --> 27:39.280]  something like our competitors use. And the green line is your basic oil tincture in the market,
[27:39.280 --> 27:44.560]  right? Taking a distillate and mixing that with that, something like an olive oil or MCT oil.
[27:45.440 --> 27:53.760]  So we dosed rats with equal amounts of product from, with these three bases and tested their
[27:53.760 --> 27:59.120]  blood. And we were shown to have a much faster onset of five to 10 minutes already showing up in
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.880]  the bloodstream and around 30 minutes to what's called the C-max, which is the highest concentration
[28:04.880 --> 28:11.680]  mark in the bloodstream for that ingredient that you're testing for. So as you can see here,
[28:11.680 --> 28:17.920]  you know, our ingredient has a much faster onset time and gets into the bloodstream at a much
[28:17.920 --> 28:24.400]  higher rate than the oil tincture, almost 5x the highest concentration in the oil tincture
[28:25.200 --> 28:31.200]  our ingredient achieves. And then compared to kind of a basic emulsion in the market, we have almost
[28:31.200 --> 28:37.920]  twice as fast of an onset time as the competition. So again, we're, you know, continuing to push this
[28:37.920 --> 28:43.840]  forward. Right now we're in works to do a study in conjunction with some labs at Cornell and kind of
[28:43.840 --> 28:50.800]  moving from a rat model to a dog model, and then hopefully soon in the future into human models
[28:51.600 --> 28:56.240]  to continue to learn more and develop more data around our products.
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.880]  Let's see. So yeah, maybe I'll kind of take a step back and talk a little bit about the
[29:02.880 --> 29:08.240]  regulatory environment. You know, generally that is one of the things holding this industry back
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.120]  the most is the complicated structure of, you know, how do you actually commercialize products
[29:13.120 --> 29:18.800]  in this space. But to kind of take a step back, it really all started with the 2018 farm bill that
[29:18.800 --> 29:24.400]  legalized hemp in all 50 states. Now that really got this industry started. You saw a huge hype
[29:24.400 --> 29:31.440]  cycle right after that farm bill passed with prices for raw ingredients increasing almost tenfold,
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.640]  and then dropping more than that over the course of a year and a half. It was, you know, quite,
[29:36.640 --> 29:41.120]  you know, exciting and interesting time in the market. But with the emergence of that farm bill,
[29:41.120 --> 29:46.320]  we had a truly legal market where now you could produce hemp products in one state, and as long
[29:46.320 --> 29:53.520]  as they're under 0.3 percent THC, delta 9 THC, they could be then distributed and used in different
[29:53.520 --> 29:59.280]  products. So, you know, that talks to the infused products piece of things, but you know, where we
[29:59.280 --> 30:05.840]  kind of move from the FDA, from the 2018 farm bill, is to the FDA and the fact that there's a lack of
[30:05.840 --> 30:11.600]  regulation in the space, right? This is the major reason why you see companies like Coke and Pepsi
[30:11.600 --> 30:18.480]  and Monster and Red Bull not launching CBD infused products is the fact that the FDA has no regulatory
[30:18.480 --> 30:23.200]  structure around the industry. You know, right now, the only stance that the FDA has taken is
[30:23.200 --> 30:28.080]  kind of giving warning letters to companies that kind of abuse the rules, right? Making
[30:28.160 --> 30:33.520]  structural, structural, structural function claims, you know, on CBD or other, you know,
[30:33.520 --> 30:40.480]  other cannabinoids, for example, saying that CBD cures COVID or cures or, you know, has specific
[30:40.480 --> 30:45.520]  properties, right? Those are things that you're not allowed to do and you need real evidence and
[30:45.520 --> 30:52.320]  to go through FDA trials to back that by real structure, structure function claims. But, you
[30:52.320 --> 30:57.920]  know, the lack of FDA regulation in general for food and beverage and dietary supplement products
[30:57.920 --> 31:03.680]  and kind of telling, not telling the industry operators how to produce products, how to
[31:03.680 --> 31:10.000]  distribute products, how to label products poses a, you know, major issue for the industry as it
[31:10.000 --> 31:16.320]  starts to expand and bigger players start to start to jump into the industry. So, you know, something
[31:16.320 --> 31:22.080]  that has developed from the lack of FDA regulation is really state cannabis legislation. So, for
[31:22.080 --> 31:29.200]  example, both in California and New York over the past year has regulated CBD in their specific
[31:29.200 --> 31:36.240]  market. So New York has their hemp regulations that were released, I believe six or six to eight
[31:36.240 --> 31:42.640]  months ago that give clear pathway in terms of how to operate as a licensed entity and as a
[31:42.640 --> 31:49.120]  cannabis product, cannabis infused CBD infused product on the shelf. They give clear limits on
[31:49.120 --> 31:55.120]  how many milligrams you can use per unit. They give a clear process of what kind of
[31:56.560 --> 32:03.200]  regulatory licenses as well as compliance measures to have your manufacturing operation. For example,
[32:03.200 --> 32:07.680]  you know, something very common in the consumer packaged goods and co-packing industry is
[32:07.680 --> 32:13.840]  a compliance measure called current good manufacturing practices. It's a process of
[32:13.840 --> 32:20.720]  tracking your ingredients for supply chain, tracking your products, tracking how you produce
[32:20.720 --> 32:25.440]  products in your facility. So it's again, compliance to make sure that your ingredients,
[32:25.440 --> 32:33.600]  you know, have a certain quality and again, are safe. So that is, you know, something that New
[32:33.600 --> 32:40.640]  York has pretty clear regulatory structure around and has created clear regulatory structure around
[32:40.640 --> 32:46.240]  and has allowed the market to start to develop and grow in New York state. So, you know, it's
[32:46.240 --> 32:52.160]  exciting and you've seen similar regulations happen in California with the passing of AB45,
[32:52.160 --> 33:00.720]  assembly bill 45. If anybody would like to search that up after the lecture. State by state labeling
[33:00.720 --> 33:06.080]  kind of goes hand in hand with state by state cannabis legislation. That's a big difficulty in
[33:06.080 --> 33:10.400]  the space where it's great that you're starting to see a real regulatory structure that allows
[33:10.400 --> 33:17.280]  operators to create a clear path to commercializing products with that different regulatory structure
[33:17.280 --> 33:22.800]  from each state. It creates huge confusion for products, right? So maybe you have a CBD tincture
[33:23.600 --> 33:28.880]  in one state, you may have a completely different labeling requirements in another state.
[33:28.880 --> 33:34.000]  So that really creates a lot of inefficiencies in the supply chain and causes
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.520]  major problems, you know, at the end of the day. Maybe the last thing I'll kind of end this off
[33:39.520 --> 33:47.360]  with is a Delta eight and kind of your hemp derived psychoactive cannabinoids. So Delta eight
[33:47.360 --> 33:56.480]  and other similar cannabinoids like THCO or HHC are isomers of the cannabis plant. So some of these
[33:56.480 --> 34:02.560]  cannabinoids show up in the plant, which were the very, very small, my new percentage, but there's
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.920]  been, you know, chemical reactions and ways that you can take products like the CBD isolate and
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.360]  turn that into a product like Delta eight. So what Delta eight is, it's really kind of a loophole
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.560]  in the language in the farm bill, whereas I mentioned for what constitutes hemp versus
[34:18.560 --> 34:26.000]  cannabis is kind of this base number of 0.3% Delta nine THC active in the plant material.
[34:26.560 --> 34:32.160]  So Delta eight in a different form of, it's a different cannabinoid than Delta nine, but has
[34:32.160 --> 34:37.760]  similar psychoactive effects, but due to the strict language in the farm bill that's specifically
[34:37.760 --> 34:43.360]  states Delta nine THC percentages as the indication of cannabis, there's now a loophole
[34:43.360 --> 34:49.520]  for to get a psychoactive Delta eight products that are derived from hemp onto the shelf.
[34:50.240 --> 34:56.160]  So this has been a market that's been exploding over the past two years, you know, around two
[34:56.160 --> 35:02.400]  years. But now it's kind of been pushed back with backlash from different States. For example,
[35:02.400 --> 35:07.440]  New York has explicitly said stated in their hemp regulations that Delta eight is,
[35:08.640 --> 35:16.400]  is not allowed to be produced and sold in New York. So I think that's a good overview of the
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.280]  regulatory environment. You know, right now, before I kind of open up for a larger Q and A,
[35:21.280 --> 35:27.360]  just want to talk generally about entrepreneurship. I think looking at large and emerging markets is a
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.160]  great way to kind of start the journey and seeing something that you truly have a passion for.
[35:32.720 --> 35:37.360]  People are number two, people are the most important asset of any company,
[35:37.360 --> 35:41.200]  you know, bringing in the best talent for, you know, a variety of different
[35:42.240 --> 35:48.560]  factors is critical to building a, you know, a long lasting business. And lastly, solving a real
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.800]  problem. You know, like I mentioned, you know, as I was starting this business, you know, really
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.240]  learning, you know, what the problems were of the farmers and the processors and the brands allowed
[35:58.240 --> 36:04.400]  us to kind of find our niche and build this business. So yeah, with that said, I'll kind of
[36:04.400 --> 36:10.400]  stop here and open it up for questions. I really appreciate everybody's time and I'm excited to
[36:12.160 --> 36:17.920]  continue this conversation. Yeah, thank you for that. That fantastic talk, Hunter. We have some
[36:17.920 --> 36:23.840]  questions in the Q and A. If you have a question and you haven't put it in the Q and A, please
[36:24.400 --> 36:30.480]  do that and I will get through as many as I can. Remember that the Q and A is slightly different
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.040]  than the chat. You can access the Q and A from the little widget at the bottom of your screen.
[36:35.600 --> 36:43.680]  Okay, first question we have for CBD and food products are, is it extracted from plants or can
[36:43.680 --> 36:52.560]  it come from cell cultures? So at least all the distillate or isolate that we've purchased,
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.920]  I'll kind of take a step back, all the like the general commercially available product on the
[36:57.920 --> 37:04.240]  market today is, it comes from plant material, right? You grow your, your hemp plant, process,
[37:04.240 --> 37:08.480]  you take that to biomass and then extract that and that's your kind of core input material.
[37:09.360 --> 37:13.680]  And that being said, in terms of, George, I believe you mentioned cell cultures, right?
[37:14.240 --> 37:18.800]  Before. So I believe that, you know, has some relation to, you know, different genetics that
[37:18.800 --> 37:23.920]  can be produced and, you know, cuts of different plants to drive certain genetics, which kind of
[37:23.920 --> 37:28.560]  drives your biomass inputs. That being said, I will kind of talk about another, you know,
[37:28.560 --> 37:34.160]  up and coming side of the market, which is biosynthesis, where you're taking yeast to
[37:34.160 --> 37:39.760]  produce a cannabinoid similar to the way that beer is produced today, right? When you look at
[37:39.760 --> 37:44.800]  particularly the cheaper beers on the shelf, like a Coors or Bud Light, you know, that is not
[37:44.800 --> 37:49.920]  naturally derived from, from hops. Those are yeast, you know, basically a yeast culture,
[37:50.640 --> 37:55.120]  you know, alcohol that's developed to produce that beer. So now you're seeing a lot of technology
[37:55.120 --> 38:01.680]  that is using this biosynthesis process to basically manufacture cannabinoids,
[38:01.920 --> 38:09.120]  but synthetic, it's not really a true synthetic process, it does, you know, come, you know,
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.960]  from the plant. But that is really up and coming sector of the industry that's really exciting.
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.280]  Okay, another question. So the industry challenges that you kind of covered,
[38:22.080 --> 38:28.400]  would you say those are based on kind of the traditional cannabis target market? Or has
[38:28.400 --> 38:31.840]  the target market moved to incorporate more general consumers?
[38:33.360 --> 38:38.160]  So yeah, you know, my view, you're on, and I'll just talk cannabis industry in general,
[38:38.160 --> 38:43.280]  it's an ever evolving landscape, right? You know, as we've seen, you know, markets come online,
[38:43.280 --> 38:47.760]  I'll kind of talk THC, it just starts, I think it's easier to kind of talk numbers with a little
[38:47.760 --> 38:53.040]  bit clearer data around that. You see that in the early stages of the markets that, you know,
[38:53.040 --> 38:59.200]  smokable flower and pre rolls are the vast majority, right? 55 plus percent, 60% of the
[38:59.200 --> 39:05.440]  market. But over time, as a legal market comes online, you start to see less and less smokable
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.680]  product, or at least flower product, controlling the market and more and more edible products
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.640]  gaining steam, vape products gaining steam, topical products gaining steam to take up more
[39:16.640 --> 39:22.160]  market share, where now you're really kind of seeing almost a 50 50 split in, you know, in
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.000]  these markets. So, you know, I think what we're really developing for is kind of that sector of
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.880]  the marketplace, right? As new consumers jump into the space, there is, you know, a lack of
[39:32.880 --> 39:37.600]  comfortability around smoking a product, right? Someone who hasn't necessarily consumed cannabis
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.480]  in the past, or CBD doesn't want to necessarily start, you know, smoking and adding that to their
[39:42.480 --> 39:47.920]  lifestyle, but adding, you know, a more generalized product that they're used to like a beverage,
[39:47.920 --> 39:54.080]  or, you know, a gel cap, or a confectionery vitamin type product is something that you know,
[39:54.080 --> 40:00.400]  is really generally something they do on a daily basis. And it's not, you know, really a big push
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.200]  to their normal lifestyle. So we see as the industry starts to move forward, and cannabis
[40:05.200 --> 40:11.360]  becomes, you know, more accepted, that these infused products, which now represent around
[40:11.360 --> 40:18.160]  half the market will continue to become the leader in market share for the for the industry.
[40:18.160 --> 40:27.280]  So yeah, it's a good baseline of what we do. And those pain points we're referring to are really
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.240]  revolving around infused products, and particularly water based infused products.
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.040]  For example, a vape is an oil base, and you wouldn't use a water soluble product in that,
[40:39.040 --> 40:44.400]  but really your ingestible or topical water based products is, you know, what we're solving
[40:44.400 --> 40:45.280]  this problem for.
[40:46.320 --> 40:52.720]  Okay, actually, I have a question. So you've focused a lot on kind of like CBD and emulsions.
[40:53.360 --> 40:59.520]  But obviously, hemp has like tons of different uses, specifically like hemp seed. So I'm wondering
[40:59.520 --> 41:04.240]  if your company has explored anything with like hemp seed oil or hemp protein? Or you know,
[41:04.240 --> 41:06.000]  any people exploring that kind of space?
[41:06.480 --> 41:12.240]  So, you know, we've definitely looked at the space to some degree. You know, right now,
[41:12.240 --> 41:18.480]  I think our expertise, particularly on the science side is really relates to food science and
[41:18.480 --> 41:24.960]  chemistry. So more, you know, on the kind of active ingredient side of the market. So, you know,
[41:24.960 --> 41:31.520]  there's still so much science to be done in that area that we want to, you know, continue pushing
[41:32.400 --> 41:36.880]  and tackling problems around that side of the market. But, you know, generally, you know,
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.040]  from an interest point of view, I'm super excited about, you know, all the different attributes of
[41:41.040 --> 41:46.000]  hemp, from hemp seeds to the fiber and how that can, you know, affect everything from
[41:46.720 --> 41:53.200]  construction to clothing to, you know, better protein sources. So, you know, us as a company
[41:53.200 --> 41:58.880]  today, aren't really pushing towards that side of the market. But it's something I definitely
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.800]  have a lot of interest as well as excitement around.
[42:04.960 --> 42:11.920]  Great. Okay, another question from the audience. This is kind of a logistics question. Given that
[42:11.920 --> 42:18.640]  full spectrum distillate is likely over 0.3% THC, how do you deal with that on the legal side?
[42:18.640 --> 42:24.800]  Yeah. So, you know, as I mentioned, the state by state regs, you know, all have different rules.
[42:24.800 --> 42:30.560]  But for example, in New York, you know, don't quote me on it, but I believe it is up to 3%
[42:31.200 --> 42:37.520]  in what's called work in progress hemp material. So depending on the state, you'll have, you know,
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.960]  different regulations that qualify what, you know, what you can use as a licensed manufacturer,
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.320]  as it's not an end consumer product, right? So when you're looking at, you know, a distillate,
[42:48.320 --> 42:54.240]  it has to be derived from a hemp plant that has less than 0.3% in the product,
[42:54.240 --> 43:02.320]  that then is extracted, and you know, maybe taking it from 10% CBD to 85% CBD. So if you're at
[43:02.320 --> 43:08.080]  0.1% THC in the plant material, now you're at just under a percentage point. But based on New York
[43:08.080 --> 43:13.840]  regs, you're still that that's perfectly compliant, as long as the end product, whether that be the
[43:13.840 --> 43:21.120]  tincture or beverage, etc, has less than 0.3% Delta nine THC by weight. So generally, that's
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.920]  that is a problem, you know, in the market, particularly with, you know, other states not
[43:25.920 --> 43:31.760]  regulating that and people crossing state lines in certain states that still have kind of antiquated
[43:31.760 --> 43:37.280]  laws around, you know, this space, you know, I think you've started to see a lot of slowdown
[43:37.280 --> 43:44.480]  and convictions around products being crossing state lines. But you know, in the kind of 2018 2019
[43:44.480 --> 43:53.280]  timeframe, you saw, you know, a lot of, you know, some real issues with that as, as companies were
[43:53.280 --> 43:59.040]  crossing state lines with those products. But, you know, in New York, you have clear regular
[43:59.040 --> 44:05.440]  regulations around what's allowed to be used in the license supply chain. So yeah.
[44:06.320 --> 44:15.440]  Um, another question, is your company doing anything with terpenes? Or do you see that as a
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.600]  another space in addition to cannabinoids? Yeah, so we're super, super excited about terpenes. And,
[44:21.600 --> 44:26.320]  you know, maybe I'll start by saying that terpenes by nature are an oil, right? So our technology is
[44:26.320 --> 44:32.160]  applicable to terpenes and something that, you know, personally, I'm super excited about and feel
[44:33.040 --> 44:37.520]  that terpenes are really going to be the next driver of kind of mood states in addition to
[44:37.520 --> 44:43.040]  cannabinoids, right? How do you drive specific, you know, functions, you know, with the addition
[44:43.040 --> 44:47.280]  of unique terpenes in conjunction with those cannabinoids. So I think there's a lot of
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.440]  research to be done in terms of what terpenes do, do they do anything or not. And people a lot
[44:53.440 --> 44:59.040]  smarter than me are the ones kind of developing that research and really seeing what does what.
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.120]  But yeah, we're starting to see at least from the commercial side, a lot more interest of,
[45:03.760 --> 45:08.320]  you know, brands wanting to use terpenes and water soluble terpenes in the products.
[45:09.200 --> 45:13.920]  So it's definitely something we're pursuing. And now doing R&D on and now we're actually producing
[45:13.920 --> 45:20.560]  water soluble terpenes as a product line. So that's funny, that's something we've been just,
[45:20.560 --> 45:26.320]  just really started commercialize over the past few weeks. So it's a really exciting part of the
[45:26.320 --> 45:34.400]  market. Very cool. A couple of questions on your, your study to compare your kind of emulsion to
[45:34.400 --> 45:43.200]  the standard industry emulsion and the oil. So when you achieve, when you indicate that you
[45:43.200 --> 45:52.000]  achieve better results, how would you define this quantitatively? And have other studies kind of
[45:52.000 --> 45:59.920]  been done like this to determine like what a rapid onset means or what extended length of effect means?
[46:01.200 --> 46:06.080]  Yeah. So, you know, in terms of quantitative, you know, analysis, a couple of key points,
[46:06.080 --> 46:12.080]  right. I think I mentioned Cmax, right. So Cmax is the highest concentration in the bloodstream
[46:12.080 --> 46:18.640]  that's recorded in one of these PK studies. So from a basic level, we compared Cmax of our emulsion
[46:18.640 --> 46:24.240]  to the Cmax of the basic emulsion to the Cmax of the oil tincture and show that, you know,
[46:24.240 --> 46:31.760]  ours was 30 minutes. The basic emulsion was 70 minutes and the oil tincture was, you know, 180
[46:31.760 --> 46:39.120]  plus minutes. Didn't really ever reach, you know, a full peak over the course of like four hours or
[46:39.120 --> 46:47.040]  so. So, you know, that's like generally quantitatively how we're testing that in addition to
[46:47.040 --> 46:51.040]  just seeing when it shows up in the bloodstream as you saw in that graph. You know, those are
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.720]  actual results from the rat study that have said, okay, at this interval in time, there was this
[46:56.720 --> 47:02.960]  many milligrams in the bloodstream versus these other product types. So again, you know, this is
[47:02.960 --> 47:09.360]  just the first of many studies that we plan to do. And yeah, our next study is going to be around
[47:10.000 --> 47:15.520]  a dog model, hopefully one day around a human model. And, you know, comparing to some of the
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.920]  competition in the space, I think exactly what you mentioned where there's a lack of real evidence
[47:21.120 --> 47:26.720]  is why we decided to invest in these quite extensive studies. But we feel that it's really
[47:26.720 --> 47:31.280]  important to actually have real data behind what we're doing as opposed to just making claims of
[47:31.280 --> 47:36.640]  we have fast onset time or we have an onset time of five minutes or two minutes or a high
[47:36.640 --> 47:42.480]  bioavailability, which we see a lot of the competition in the space do. But those claims
[47:42.480 --> 47:48.560]  are kind of backed by nothing, which again, we feel is a big problem. And as you see more
[47:48.560 --> 47:53.360]  sophisticated consumer packaged goods companies come into the space, they're really going to be
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.720]  looking for this hard evidence from an efficacy point of view, as well as from a stability point
[47:58.720 --> 48:02.720]  of view. So, you know, that's really what we're building up to right now is trying to build as
[48:02.720 --> 48:08.080]  big of a book of evidence as possible, getting ready for future FDA regulation.
[48:09.040 --> 48:18.640]  Great. Another question on that study. So how would you expect the levels in the model system
[48:18.640 --> 48:26.720]  to correlate to humans? Do you know what levels of CBD are required to achieve
[48:27.760 --> 48:29.600]  physiologically significant effects?
[48:30.160 --> 48:38.720]  So, you know, again, I'm not the full on scientist and learned slowly by doing here
[48:38.720 --> 48:44.720]  with great people around us. I believe the rat model is a great indicator of what it can look
[48:44.720 --> 48:50.640]  like in mammalian model. Again, what we're doing to push forward is then moving up the next chain
[48:50.640 --> 48:57.440]  to a dog and then one day doing a human. But then again, the cost associated with doing these more
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.800]  complicated models are significantly increasing, even going from the rat, the dog and dog to
[49:02.800 --> 49:07.920]  humans. So it's definitely something that we plan to do as the company develops.
[49:09.520 --> 49:15.680]  Terms of like what is an efficacious dose? I think that's a, you know, a big, not necessarily
[49:15.680 --> 49:20.480]  controversy, but a big talking point in the industry. Right. For example, in New York,
[49:20.480 --> 49:26.080]  it's 25 milligrams max per unit in the food and beverage product. So the question is,
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.520]  is that a real efficacious dose? What is an efficacious dose? What is placebo effect versus
[49:31.520 --> 49:36.720]  not? You know, I can talk from, you know, the one approved pharmaceutical drug in the market
[49:36.720 --> 49:44.640]  called Epidiolex. That's a drug used for children with epilepsy. Those doses range to from 600 to
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.080]  2000 plus milligrams. So that's what we're seeing as like a true pharmaceutical dose.
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.600]  That being said, for more of your wellness doses, what we see in the market is somewhere in the
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.880]  range of 25 to a hundred milligrams with regulations kind of limiting your food and
[50:00.880 --> 50:06.000]  beverage products at 25 milligram per unit base. So again, I think that's where there's opportunities
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.480]  in the space to just kind of push science and learn more, invest more money in research.
[50:11.280 --> 50:15.520]  As we continue to develop out again, that's another issue just with the FDA, right? The
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.760]  lack of regulation in the space is really limiting research around, you know, what does the, what do
[50:21.760 --> 50:26.880]  these cannabinoids actually do? And you know, what do we need to, and how much do we need to
[50:26.880 --> 50:36.480]  take, et cetera. So I hope that's a decent answer for you. Another question, people are very
[50:36.480 --> 50:42.720]  interested in the study that you did. Are you looking to kind of explore or conduct studies on
[50:45.520 --> 50:51.600]  like pregnant mice or pregnant rats? And they point out that it might be important for regulations
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.600]  because this is a specifically vulnerable or population.
[50:57.120 --> 51:02.080]  To be honest, I never, never even thought about that. I think I'll bring that up with Nick as we
[51:02.080 --> 51:08.880]  move into our next study. I know our next one is definitely going to be in a dog model. But,
[51:08.880 --> 51:14.000]  you know, as you move forward, just trying to build up a book of evidence and kind of anticipating
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.880]  what the FDA regulations look like. And I think I saw something in the Q and A chat box about
[51:18.880 --> 51:24.080]  novel foods. One of the big things that we want to do is a toxicity study, right? You know,
[51:24.080 --> 51:32.720]  that's a really, really expensive study upwards of potentially a $500,000 plus study. So, and that's,
[51:33.520 --> 51:39.120]  you know, that's, that's what we want to get to, but right now with lack of rules and knowing what
[51:39.120 --> 51:45.120]  we need to even test for at least in the U S it's hard to make those investments. So, you know,
[51:45.120 --> 51:48.720]  again, right now we're kind of taking it one step at a time and trying to build up as much
[51:48.720 --> 51:56.160]  evidence as possible. You know, while keeping costs under control. Awesome. Another question.
[51:56.800 --> 52:02.560]  Have you been able to export your cannabinoid ingredients to Europe? And do you have novel
[52:02.560 --> 52:09.440]  foods authorization? So we don't have novel foods authorization just yet. Something that we've been
[52:09.440 --> 52:15.360]  looking into that being said, you know, we will be announcing the next couple of weeks,
[52:16.240 --> 52:20.880]  our entrance into the Southeast Asian market. We're going to be entering the Thai market
[52:20.880 --> 52:28.880]  through a licensing deal. Thailand has really clear regulations around the use of CBD in products. Now
[52:28.880 --> 52:35.200]  it's a fully legal market there. So we will be working with an operator on the ground in Thailand
[52:35.200 --> 52:41.360]  to bring our technology to that market. So that'll be our first international expansion. We'll be
[52:41.360 --> 52:45.920]  into Thailand and the Southeast Asian market. So we're really excited about that. And this is the
[52:45.920 --> 52:54.240]  first time I've talked about it publicly. So exciting to talk about that. Very cool. I think
[52:54.240 --> 53:00.800]  we'll just do one more question here and wrap it up. I know you probably put you through the
[53:00.800 --> 53:09.520]  ringer these last 15 minutes. So we got one more. Have you done stability testing on your products
[53:09.520 --> 53:15.120]  and what kind of shelf life range have you seen? Yeah. So our products have stayed on the shelf for
[53:15.120 --> 53:21.120]  well over a year and have shown really great stability, you know, less than a few percentage
[53:21.120 --> 53:26.880]  points of degradation. You know, again, what we do is a couple of different paths, right? We've left
[53:26.880 --> 53:33.200]  our products on the shelf. They have true stability of actual time in a product, as well as just as an
[53:33.200 --> 53:38.080]  ingredient on the shelf. There's nothing better than that stability test. There's also rapid
[53:38.080 --> 53:45.520]  stability where you can use heated chambers to anticipate quicker times, maybe a month,
[53:45.520 --> 53:50.400]  it can look like a year from a stability point of view in these different stability chambers.
[53:50.400 --> 53:55.200]  And then the last way that we go about stability testing is using a unique rapid stability
[53:55.200 --> 54:02.080]  equipment where we basically test an infused product and see basically spin it really fast
[54:02.080 --> 54:07.120]  and light particles through it to kind of anticipate how stable is something really quickly.
[54:07.120 --> 54:12.800]  So as opposed to even taking a month or two months sitting on the shelf and in a heated chamber,
[54:12.800 --> 54:20.080]  we can tell in a matter of hours, generally how physically stable our emulsion is with a certain
[54:20.080 --> 54:24.800]  product type. And that goes to kind of a customization, but that's how, you know,
[54:24.800 --> 54:30.160]  the three ways we go about stability testing and we do a rapid stability test on any product
[54:30.640 --> 54:33.760]  commercialized to get that baseline at the minimum.
[54:34.800 --> 54:40.560]  So I want to thank you once again, Hunter, for that wonderful talk. I sure learned a lot and it
[54:40.560 --> 54:48.240]  was fascinating to see your perspective and experience. I believe that many of our attendees
[54:48.240 --> 54:54.320]  feel the same way. So, you know, best of luck to you and thanks again for all of your time. And it
[54:54.320 --> 54:58.000]  was a real pleasure to hear your talk.
[54:58.480 --> 55:03.040]  Thank you so much, everybody. Again, my contact information is here. Please feel free to
[55:03.680 --> 55:09.600]  reach out and I'm looking forward to continuing this and again, thank you everybody.
