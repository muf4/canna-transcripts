[00:00.000 --> 00:07.910]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.910 --> 00:09.070]  Thanks, Larry.
[00:09.070 --> 00:11.350]  As Larry mentioned, we're running a little late already.
[00:11.350 --> 00:13.590]  So I'm going to go through these slides fairly quickly
[00:13.590 --> 00:17.710]  because I think it's probably a bit of review for most of you.
[00:17.710 --> 00:20.190]  And that will leave more time for questions and answers
[00:20.190 --> 00:22.350]  afterward.
[00:22.350 --> 00:25.150]  So in 2018, the federal Farm Bill
[00:25.150 --> 00:29.390]  required that all the industrial hemp research pilot programs
[00:29.390 --> 00:33.230]  that we had operated from 2017 up until 2021,
[00:33.230 --> 00:38.110]  they all had to expire at the end of 2021.
[00:38.110 --> 00:40.510]  It also said that in order to continue
[00:40.510 --> 00:42.630]  to administer a hemp program in the future,
[00:42.630 --> 00:47.830]  states either had to have a USDA approved hemp program plan
[00:47.830 --> 00:51.310]  or the USDA was going to take over administration
[00:51.310 --> 00:52.870]  of the programs in the states.
[00:52.870 --> 00:54.510]  So we opted to submit a plan.
[00:54.510 --> 00:58.070]  Our plan was approved in October of 2021.
[00:58.070 --> 01:02.390]  And we have been running that program ever since.
[01:02.390 --> 01:06.350]  Our program plan can be found on the USDA hemp website
[01:06.350 --> 01:08.150]  if you're looking to, if you really
[01:08.150 --> 01:10.190]  want to get into the details.
[01:10.190 --> 01:12.110]  You can just Google USDA hemp program
[01:12.110 --> 01:15.550]  and you'll see all the state programs.
[01:15.550 --> 01:16.670]  So this is important.
[01:16.670 --> 01:20.630]  And I think you all should know, if you are a registered grower,
[01:20.630 --> 01:23.070]  if you have been, I mean, in the past in the pilot program,
[01:23.070 --> 01:24.430]  you should have received probably
[01:24.430 --> 01:26.670]  a dozen emails about this.
[01:26.670 --> 01:30.230]  But anyone who had the license in the pilot program,
[01:30.230 --> 01:32.390]  that license has expired regardless
[01:32.390 --> 01:33.950]  of the date on the authorization.
[01:33.950 --> 01:37.550]  That expired by act of federal law at the end of 2021.
[01:37.550 --> 01:41.390]  So if you want to grow this year, or God forbid,
[01:41.390 --> 01:43.910]  you are growing this year under the old license,
[01:43.910 --> 01:47.150]  you need to get in touch with me quickly.
[01:47.150 --> 01:52.670]  Also new this year, we are requiring a license
[01:52.670 --> 01:55.430]  to sell hemp seed in New York state.
[01:55.430 --> 01:57.030]  That license is good for three years.
[01:57.030 --> 01:59.190]  There's $100 application fee.
[01:59.190 --> 02:03.190]  The hemp seed can only be sold to registered hemp growers.
[02:03.190 --> 02:06.830]  We have a fairly detailed hemp program guidance document
[02:06.830 --> 02:09.110]  on our website.
[02:09.110 --> 02:11.630]  The website address is there at the bottom of the page.
[02:11.630 --> 02:16.030]  We also have adopted regulations to administer this program.
[02:16.030 --> 02:18.550]  And our regulations follow pretty much
[02:18.550 --> 02:22.470]  to the letter the requirements that the USDA has put in place
[02:22.470 --> 02:23.990]  and that the Farm Bill put in place.
[02:23.990 --> 02:28.950]  So we don't have a whole lot of superfluous regulations
[02:28.950 --> 02:29.470]  in there.
[02:29.470 --> 02:30.590]  We didn't regulate for fun.
[02:30.590 --> 02:33.110]  We regulated exactly what we needed to do.
[02:33.110 --> 02:36.750]  Those regulations are also found on our website.
[02:36.750 --> 02:39.910]  We're really happy to have the regulations in place
[02:39.910 --> 02:42.630]  because, as many of you know, in the past,
[02:42.630 --> 02:44.950]  you had to do the research partner agreements, which
[02:44.950 --> 02:47.190]  was more or less a contract between you and the state.
[02:47.190 --> 02:49.270]  And it outlined what you were responsible for
[02:49.270 --> 02:51.270]  and what we were responsible for.
[02:51.270 --> 02:54.030]  But there was still some room for ambiguity in there.
[02:54.030 --> 02:56.670]  The regs really have done away with that ambiguity.
[02:56.670 --> 02:58.230]  So we're pretty happy about that.
[02:58.230 --> 03:00.470]  And it hopefully should add clarity and certainty
[03:00.470 --> 03:03.310]  for all of our growers.
[03:03.310 --> 03:09.590]  So new in 2022 under the USDA approved program,
[03:09.590 --> 03:11.910]  in addition to submitting the application to us
[03:11.910 --> 03:13.910]  and the $500 application fee, you
[03:13.910 --> 03:17.110]  also have to submit an FBI background check.
[03:17.110 --> 03:19.230]  This is a federal requirement.
[03:19.230 --> 03:22.070]  The background check can't be any more than 60 days old
[03:22.070 --> 03:24.790]  at the time when you're submitting it.
[03:24.790 --> 03:27.870]  And the only thing that really will disqualify you
[03:27.910 --> 03:30.310]  on that background check from getting a license
[03:30.310 --> 03:34.070]  is a drug-related felony conviction
[03:34.070 --> 03:36.750]  within the last 10 years.
[03:36.750 --> 03:38.630]  I've seen a lot of rap sheets.
[03:38.630 --> 03:40.270]  It's unbelievable.
[03:40.270 --> 03:42.830]  But as long as you don't have a drug conviction,
[03:42.830 --> 03:44.070]  you're all set.
[03:44.070 --> 03:49.110]  Got lots of convictions, but no felony drug
[03:49.110 --> 03:51.550]  convictions in the program.
[03:51.550 --> 03:55.070]  Also new this year, total THC is the standard.
[03:55.070 --> 03:57.590]  That's also a federal requirement.
[03:57.590 --> 04:04.230]  So we're testing for total THC, and the standard is still 0.3%.
[04:04.230 --> 04:08.070]  We will not be the primary sampler or tester
[04:08.070 --> 04:10.910]  as we have been in the past.
[04:10.910 --> 04:12.830]  So growers that are licensed in the program
[04:12.830 --> 04:16.030]  now will have to contract with a certified sampling agent.
[04:16.030 --> 04:19.350]  We have a list of those folks on our website.
[04:19.350 --> 04:20.790]  Chuck Schmidt is with me here today.
[04:20.790 --> 04:21.630]  He coordinates that.
[04:21.630 --> 04:23.670]  How many is it on here?
[04:24.670 --> 04:27.430]  Let's see.
[04:27.430 --> 04:32.110]  We have probably 60, I believe, certified sampling agents,
[04:32.110 --> 04:34.590]  and we have 22 labs identified.
[04:34.590 --> 04:36.030]  They're listed on our website, too.
[04:36.030 --> 04:41.310]  But that is a model that we had to enter into
[04:41.310 --> 04:44.630]  because the USDA requires now that every lot of hemp
[04:44.630 --> 04:45.710]  is sampled.
[04:45.710 --> 04:48.670]  And that was just more than we could do with the staff
[04:48.670 --> 04:49.710]  that we had.
[04:49.710 --> 04:51.910]  So we had to go to this privatized model, which
[04:51.950 --> 04:53.950]  is what the USDA does in states where
[04:53.950 --> 04:56.990]  they administer the program.
[04:56.990 --> 05:00.710]  You cannot sample your own crop, so you can't be a sampling
[05:00.710 --> 05:03.990]  agent and a grower.
[05:03.990 --> 05:08.430]  And growers can't sample their friends' crops.
[05:08.430 --> 05:10.670]  So nobody who's got a license can be a grower,
[05:10.670 --> 05:17.350]  and no employee of a licensed grower can be a sampler.
[05:17.350 --> 05:20.550]  Also new this year, and this is fairly standard practice
[05:20.590 --> 05:23.790]  with most farm operations, but a lot of folks
[05:23.790 --> 05:26.230]  that are growing hemp have not done other farming.
[05:26.230 --> 05:29.230]  You need to register your fields with the FSA, the Farm Service
[05:29.230 --> 05:32.150]  Agency in the county that you are growing in
[05:32.150 --> 05:33.270]  or the county close by.
[05:33.270 --> 05:36.230]  Not every county has an FSA office anymore,
[05:36.230 --> 05:38.950]  but the fields need to be registered with the FSA,
[05:38.950 --> 05:42.270]  and then they report those locations to the USDA,
[05:42.270 --> 05:45.310]  who in turn reports them to the DEA, the Drug Enforcement
[05:45.310 --> 05:45.830]  Agency.
[05:45.830 --> 05:50.390]  So this is still a highly regulated plant,
[05:50.390 --> 05:55.710]  and hopefully that may change in the future.
[05:58.870 --> 06:04.150]  Well, here's some reasons that an application may be denied.
[06:04.150 --> 06:08.790]  If it's incorrect or incomplete, the drug-related felony
[06:08.790 --> 06:10.270]  that I mentioned before.
[06:10.270 --> 06:12.470]  If you don't submit the background check,
[06:12.470 --> 06:14.670]  that's a problem.
[06:14.670 --> 06:16.390]  If you're growing on a field that's
[06:16.390 --> 06:18.910]  registered to someone else, we can't have that,
[06:18.910 --> 06:22.230]  because if that field goes hot and you've
[06:22.230 --> 06:24.150]  got two people registered there, they're
[06:24.150 --> 06:26.950]  going to do like this, who's responsible for the hot stuff.
[06:26.950 --> 06:32.390]  So you cannot have co-located registered fields.
[06:32.390 --> 06:35.710]  You cannot grow in an area that's zoned residential,
[06:35.710 --> 06:37.590]  and you cannot grow in a residence
[06:37.590 --> 06:39.910]  or in an attached garage.
[06:39.910 --> 06:41.350]  You wouldn't believe how many people
[06:41.350 --> 06:42.630]  want to grow in their bedrooms.
[06:42.630 --> 06:48.230]  It's very surprising to me, but it does come up.
[06:48.230 --> 06:50.190]  Failure to sign the application and failure
[06:50.190 --> 06:52.950]  to submit the application fee would also be reasons
[06:52.950 --> 06:54.710]  that we would have to deny it.
[06:54.710 --> 06:56.550]  I try to work with people if they have,
[06:56.550 --> 07:00.750]  other than the drug problem, I give people a chance
[07:00.750 --> 07:02.990]  to cure their applications and don't charge them
[07:02.990 --> 07:06.790]  an additional fee, but it just slows the process.
[07:09.310 --> 07:10.030]  All right.
[07:10.070 --> 07:13.750]  As I've mentioned every time I've ever given a presentation,
[07:13.750 --> 07:15.430]  it's really advisable to know where
[07:15.430 --> 07:18.350]  you're going to sell the stuff before you plant it.
[07:18.350 --> 07:20.910]  You don't want to be in a situation at harvest time
[07:20.910 --> 07:23.190]  and have a barn full of hemp and then call me and say,
[07:23.190 --> 07:24.990]  what am I supposed to do with this?
[07:24.990 --> 07:26.190]  I don't know.
[07:26.190 --> 07:27.030]  I'm not a broker.
[07:27.030 --> 07:28.070]  I'm just a regulator.
[07:28.070 --> 07:30.370]  So you really should know where you're going to sell it
[07:30.370 --> 07:31.430]  before you plant it.
[07:31.430 --> 07:34.150]  Also, zoning is a local issue in New York state.
[07:34.150 --> 07:37.110]  So you need to check with your town as to what the zoning is.
[07:37.110 --> 07:39.990]  The state does not administer zoning.
[07:39.990 --> 07:41.990]  New York is a home rule state, so the zoning
[07:41.990 --> 07:45.230]  is left to the localities.
[07:45.230 --> 07:49.110]  We have to inspect hemp growers at least once
[07:49.110 --> 07:51.510]  in the three-year license cycle.
[07:51.510 --> 07:53.470]  You won't be getting inspected every year,
[07:53.470 --> 07:57.030]  although we do reserve the right to inspect you more than once
[07:57.030 --> 07:59.550]  in the three-year cycle.
[07:59.550 --> 08:01.030]  Know the varieties.
[08:01.030 --> 08:02.790]  Know the characteristics of the varieties
[08:02.790 --> 08:03.870]  that you're going to grow.
[08:03.870 --> 08:05.230]  They have a tendency to go hot.
[08:10.910 --> 08:12.990]  Things are much more strict than they used to be.
[08:12.990 --> 08:14.790]  We don't have any wiggle room, really.
[08:14.790 --> 08:24.630]  So if you come back with a sample that's above 1%,
[08:24.630 --> 08:27.310]  you have to enter into a corrective action plan with us.
[08:27.310 --> 08:29.150]  And it's a two-year process.
[08:29.150 --> 08:31.190]  And it's just a lot of headaches.
[08:31.190 --> 08:34.150]  And if the stuff comes back really hot,
[08:34.150 --> 08:37.390]  I'm compelled to notify the US Attorney General, the New York
[08:37.390 --> 08:39.310]  State Attorney General, and law enforcement.
[08:39.310 --> 08:42.550]  So know what you're growing and keep an eye on it.
[08:42.550 --> 08:46.870]  Make sure you're not going to get into trouble.
[08:46.870 --> 08:51.950]  OK, having said all that, we're hoping in the coming years
[08:51.950 --> 08:55.310]  to be able to reduce the burden of sampling and testing
[08:55.310 --> 08:57.350]  by doing performance-based sampling.
[08:57.350 --> 08:59.110]  And that would exempt some people
[08:59.110 --> 09:01.590]  from sampling if they're growing varieties that
[09:01.590 --> 09:08.230]  are known to be compliant, don't have a tendency to go hot.
[09:08.230 --> 09:12.270]  It's also going to, fiber and grain varieties typically
[09:12.270 --> 09:15.510]  are not going to be as likely to go hot as CBD.
[09:15.510 --> 09:18.350]  So that would be a factor that would enter into it.
[09:18.350 --> 09:21.030]  If you're using certified seed, that would certainly help.
[09:21.030 --> 09:22.710]  And the history of the grower would
[09:22.710 --> 09:24.910]  help us make that determination as to whether or not
[09:24.910 --> 09:25.830]  you could be exempted.
[09:25.830 --> 09:27.790]  If you've been a compliant grower,
[09:27.790 --> 09:29.550]  you've got all your paperwork filed,
[09:29.550 --> 09:31.830]  that would really work in your favor.
[09:34.550 --> 09:37.110]  OK, so far this year, because the program
[09:37.110 --> 09:40.350]  expired at the end of last year, at that time,
[09:40.350 --> 09:45.870]  we were up to 745 growers that represented about 30,000 acres
[09:45.870 --> 09:47.270]  of registered land.
[09:47.270 --> 09:50.670]  But everyone's license expired, so we started from scratch.
[09:50.670 --> 09:56.030]  We now have 229 licensed growers with a little over 4,500 acres
[09:56.070 --> 10:00.230]  outdoors and 2.5 million square feet indoors registered.
[10:00.230 --> 10:03.910]  And as I mentioned before, we have the 60 certified sampling
[10:03.910 --> 10:07.910]  agents and 22 identified labs.
[10:07.910 --> 10:13.510]  So questions regarding marijuana and CBD processing or sales
[10:13.510 --> 10:15.230]  are not me.
[10:15.230 --> 10:17.190]  We do not do that at Ag and Market,
[10:17.190 --> 10:19.750]  so those should be addressed to the Office of Cannabis
[10:19.750 --> 10:20.230]  Management.
[10:20.230 --> 10:22.830]  And Pat will be following me here shortly,
[10:22.830 --> 10:26.870]  so he can help you out a little bit if you have questions.
[10:26.870 --> 10:31.870]  But there's their information if you have marijuana related
[10:31.870 --> 10:32.430]  questions.
[10:32.430 --> 10:40.870]  I can leave that up for a minute.
[10:40.870 --> 10:45.710]  And here's, if you do have questions about hemp,
[10:45.710 --> 10:50.950]  there's our website, our industrial hemp email address,
[10:50.950 --> 10:54.110]  and the hemp hotline.
[10:54.110 --> 10:56.550]  So feel free.
[10:56.590 --> 10:59.150]  It's a red phone.
[10:59.150 --> 11:01.430]  No, no, right, exactly.
[11:01.430 --> 11:06.550]  So if you do have questions, please feel free to call
[11:06.550 --> 11:10.390]  anytime, and we'll see if we can help you out.
[11:10.390 --> 11:11.510]  And that's the end of that.
[11:11.510 --> 11:13.790]  So I can take questions now.
[11:13.790 --> 11:16.110]  If I don't get to your question or if you'd rather not
[11:16.110 --> 11:19.110]  ask it in public, I'm going to be around most of the day,
[11:19.110 --> 11:21.110]  so you can hunt me down, and I'll
[11:21.110 --> 11:24.110]  be more than happy to talk to you.
[11:24.150 --> 11:27.390]  The question is, if the zoning on your property
[11:27.390 --> 11:29.910]  is residential and agriculture, and a lot of zoning
[11:29.910 --> 11:31.750]  is that, it's residential, but it
[11:31.750 --> 11:34.430]  allows some agricultural uses, that would be OK.
[11:34.430 --> 11:36.310]  But if it's strictly residential,
[11:36.310 --> 11:37.950]  then it's not allowed.
[11:37.950 --> 11:39.150]  So that's an issue.
[11:39.150 --> 11:42.230]  You want to make sure you check with your town zoning office.
[11:42.230 --> 11:44.470]  No, no.
[11:44.470 --> 11:48.150]  The question was, what if you are in the Adirondack Park?
[11:48.150 --> 11:52.590]  To my knowledge, there's no restriction on growing.
[11:52.590 --> 11:55.350]  Hemp is a statutorily recognized agricultural crop
[11:55.350 --> 12:00.710]  now, so it's just like growing corn or anything else.
[12:00.710 --> 12:04.710]  The zoning of the parcel?
[12:04.710 --> 12:07.830]  OK, so when people apply to us for a license,
[12:07.830 --> 12:10.270]  they have to register the fields on which
[12:10.270 --> 12:11.390]  they intend to grow hemp.
[12:11.390 --> 12:15.150]  So they provide a GPS coordinates for each field
[12:15.150 --> 12:16.230]  that they want to grow on.
[12:16.230 --> 12:21.590]  So it's up to you as the property owner or a leaser
[12:21.630 --> 12:24.270]  of property that you just tell us whatever
[12:24.270 --> 12:25.950]  field you want to grow on.
[12:25.950 --> 12:28.110]  Provide us with the GPS coordinates
[12:28.110 --> 12:30.470]  and the acreage of the field.
[12:30.470 --> 12:31.790]  That's another thing I mentioned.
[12:31.790 --> 12:34.350]  GPS coordinates are far and away the thing
[12:34.350 --> 12:37.790]  that holds up more applications than anything else.
[12:37.790 --> 12:41.470]  People just are not getting the GPS right.
[12:41.470 --> 12:44.190]  An easy way to do it is go on Google Maps,
[12:44.190 --> 12:45.710]  put in your address.
[12:45.710 --> 12:47.430]  You click on the little satellite photo
[12:47.430 --> 12:49.990]  that pops up in the bottom of the screen.
[12:50.030 --> 12:52.350]  You can zoom into your exact field
[12:52.350 --> 12:54.430]  and right click on the center of the field.
[12:54.430 --> 12:56.110]  Just right click on your cursor.
[12:56.110 --> 12:59.910]  The GPS coordinates pop up.
[12:59.910 --> 13:02.070]  Mary?
[13:02.070 --> 13:04.310]  No.
[13:04.310 --> 13:08.790]  So the question was, do you have to notify me every year
[13:08.790 --> 13:12.190]  of the field location?
[13:12.190 --> 13:14.150]  The license is good for three years.
[13:14.150 --> 13:16.550]  So actually, you'll have to do a planting report with us,
[13:16.550 --> 13:18.430]  and you have to register your field with the FSA.
[13:18.470 --> 13:21.830]  So I guess, yes, we would get that information each year.
[13:21.830 --> 13:25.310]  But there's no requirement that you do any amendment
[13:25.310 --> 13:28.510]  or any extra application with us.
[13:28.510 --> 13:32.590]  So the question is, what's the cost for sampling and testing?
[13:32.590 --> 13:34.510]  And is there a circumstance where you wouldn't
[13:34.510 --> 13:37.910]  have to have testing done if you're a researcher or breeder?
[13:37.910 --> 13:40.150]  The cost for the sampling is something
[13:40.150 --> 13:42.750]  that you would arrive at with your sampling agent.
[13:42.750 --> 13:43.710]  There's no set cost.
[13:43.710 --> 13:47.230]  We don't dictate what those people are charging.
[13:47.230 --> 13:51.830]  And the labs, similarly, are whatever the labs are charging.
[13:51.830 --> 13:55.190]  If when you apply, you apply for a research license,
[13:55.190 --> 13:58.950]  there will be some performance-based sampling
[13:58.950 --> 13:59.790]  that you could do.
[13:59.790 --> 14:00.870]  You could do less.
[14:00.870 --> 14:03.270]  You may be exempt entirely.
[14:03.270 --> 14:06.150]  However, if you have signed up for a research license,
[14:06.150 --> 14:09.190]  nothing you grow can move into commerce.
[14:09.190 --> 14:10.510]  So you can't sell anything.
[14:10.510 --> 14:12.790]  So it's really research.
[14:13.630 --> 14:16.670]  Did that answer your question?
[14:16.670 --> 14:18.670]  Yeah.
[14:18.670 --> 14:21.470]  So yes, that would definitely count against you.
[14:21.470 --> 14:24.750]  Yeah, if you're not registered as a researcher,
[14:24.750 --> 14:28.550]  your crop has to be sampled and tested.
[14:28.550 --> 14:34.750]  And that's the onus that the USDA has put on us.
[14:34.750 --> 14:37.990]  If I can interrupt, I think we have some registered sampling
[14:37.990 --> 14:39.590]  agents in the room.
[14:39.590 --> 14:42.630]  So part of the purpose of this event is networking.
[14:42.630 --> 14:44.550]  So if you're a registered sampling agent,
[14:44.550 --> 14:47.630]  raise your hand or stand up.
[14:47.630 --> 14:48.870]  OK, I see a couple.
[14:48.870 --> 14:51.630]  I see Tony, I know, is a registered sampling agent
[14:51.630 --> 14:54.230]  and a Cornell graduate.
[14:54.230 --> 15:01.670]  So if you have not contracted with a sampling agent yet
[15:01.670 --> 15:04.550]  and you're getting ready to harvest very soon,
[15:04.550 --> 15:06.310]  there are at least a couple of them here.
[15:09.590 --> 15:12.070]  Another question.
[15:12.070 --> 15:12.870]  Chuck, do you know?
[15:12.870 --> 15:13.510]  I don't.
[15:18.310 --> 15:22.270]  The question was on typical cost of coming out and doing
[15:22.270 --> 15:23.270]  the sampling.
[15:23.270 --> 15:25.510]  Sampling agents have to buy some supplies.
[15:25.510 --> 15:26.990]  They have to have insurance.
[15:26.990 --> 15:30.150]  Some of them will charge for mileage, not mileage.
[15:30.150 --> 15:31.630]  We have sampling agents that cover
[15:31.630 --> 15:33.470]  every county in the state.
[15:33.470 --> 15:35.470]  So if they're charging mileage, you
[15:35.470 --> 15:39.430]  want to look for an agent in your county.
[15:39.430 --> 15:41.830]  Again, they work as independent contractors.
[15:41.830 --> 15:43.910]  We can't tell them what to charge,
[15:43.910 --> 15:46.350]  but we do give them parameters of things
[15:46.350 --> 15:50.390]  that they need to charge for their time and whatnot.
[15:50.390 --> 15:53.310]  So typically, I would say it's somewhere around,
[15:53.310 --> 15:55.750]  and again, this is a ballpark number,
[15:55.750 --> 15:58.950]  but somewhere around $200, $250 to come out and have
[15:58.950 --> 16:01.030]  a sample taken and sent to the lab.
[16:01.030 --> 16:02.550]  Most of the lab tests, if you're just
[16:02.550 --> 16:05.910]  looking to do a cannabinoid profile,
[16:05.910 --> 16:08.750]  I think they run around $65, $75.
[16:08.750 --> 16:11.470]  But again, that's dependent on the lab that you choose.
[16:11.470 --> 16:12.870]  And we have labs in New York State
[16:12.870 --> 16:14.270]  and labs in many other states.
[16:14.270 --> 16:18.390]  So it doesn't necessarily have to be tested in New York State.
[16:18.390 --> 16:19.950]  And you'll see on the website, there's
[16:19.950 --> 16:21.630]  probably seven or eight different states
[16:21.630 --> 16:23.790]  listed with labs as well.
[16:23.790 --> 16:26.830]  All the sampling agents are primarily in New York State.
[16:26.830 --> 16:30.030]  I think there's one or two that live in bordering states,
[16:30.030 --> 16:36.100]  but most of them are still in New York State.
[16:36.100 --> 16:37.180]  How are we doing on time?
[16:37.180 --> 16:40.380]  Yeah, we're getting close to out of time here.
[16:40.420 --> 16:44.180]  Have time for one more question if there is one.
[16:44.180 --> 16:46.140]  OK, yeah, go ahead.
[16:46.140 --> 16:51.180]  So the question is, you mean between CBD and fiber
[16:51.180 --> 16:52.460]  and grain hemp?
[16:52.460 --> 16:53.100]  Yeah, so.
[16:53.100 --> 16:55.700]  How do you use fiber, which gets hot,
[16:55.700 --> 16:59.380]  and that's not what you would tend to use it for anyway?
[16:59.380 --> 17:03.100]  Well, we would hope that for the fiber and grain varieties,
[17:03.100 --> 17:06.260]  typically they're not like CBD varieties,
[17:06.260 --> 17:09.380]  and they don't tend to go hot as often.
[17:09.380 --> 17:12.540]  So this will be part of the performance-based sampling
[17:12.540 --> 17:14.300]  program that we're establishing.
[17:14.300 --> 17:16.940]  We have to have enough data to be able to justify that
[17:16.940 --> 17:17.700]  to the USDA.
[17:17.700 --> 17:20.980]  So we're still collecting data on varieties.
[17:20.980 --> 17:25.260]  Once we have that data combined with a list of certified seed
[17:25.260 --> 17:28.900]  and then also how, if the grower has
[17:28.900 --> 17:31.260]  been a good actor in the past, those things
[17:31.260 --> 17:33.020]  will all be taken into consideration.
[17:33.020 --> 17:37.340]  And so the fiber and grain varieties will likely be,
[17:37.380 --> 17:39.100]  they would be the ones to more likely be
[17:39.100 --> 17:42.140]  excused from sampling than the CBD varieties, for instance.
[17:42.140 --> 17:45.980]  But that doesn't mean that no CBD varieties will be excused.
[17:45.980 --> 17:47.460]  It's possible.
[17:47.460 --> 17:51.820]  I'm going to be around, so you can ask me questions all day
[17:51.820 --> 17:52.620]  if you like.
[17:52.620 --> 17:59.640]  OK, thanks very much, Tim.
