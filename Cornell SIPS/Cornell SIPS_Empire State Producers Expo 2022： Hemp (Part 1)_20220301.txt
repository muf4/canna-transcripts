[00:00.640 --> 00:07.640]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.640 --> 00:10.200]  Perfect. Thank you very much.
[00:10.200 --> 00:12.680]  So thank you very much for,
[00:12.680 --> 00:15.120]  for being here today.
[00:15.120 --> 00:17.640]  I am Dr. Daniela Vergara.
[00:17.640 --> 00:20.400]  I'm the Emerging Crops Specialist,
[00:20.400 --> 00:22.160]  which as Mary was saying,
[00:22.160 --> 00:25.320]  it's a new position
[00:25.320 --> 00:27.960]  at the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[00:27.960 --> 00:32.760]  I've been a cannabis researcher for a while.
[00:33.040 --> 00:35.920]  This is my email,
[00:35.920 --> 00:40.200]  my website, if you want to contact me.
[00:41.320 --> 00:45.560]  I am going to be talking about my experience.
[00:45.560 --> 00:48.080]  So what I did mostly research at
[00:48.080 --> 00:50.320]  the University of Colorado in Boulder
[00:50.320 --> 00:53.480]  before joining the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[00:53.480 --> 00:55.040]  I am also the co-founder of
[00:55.040 --> 00:57.200]  the Cannabis Genomic Research Initiative,
[00:57.200 --> 00:59.080]  which is our group at CU Boulder,
[00:59.080 --> 01:01.120]  and the founder and director of
[01:01.120 --> 01:02.960]  the Agricultural Genomics Foundation,
[01:02.960 --> 01:05.560]  that it's a 501c3 nonprofit that aims to
[01:05.560 --> 01:10.800]  bring cannabis scientific findings to a broad public.
[01:10.800 --> 01:14.240]  So I'm going to be talking about the things that I did,
[01:14.240 --> 01:15.400]  the things that I'm doing,
[01:15.400 --> 01:19.320]  and the things that I would like to do in the future.
[01:19.560 --> 01:25.120]  So for those of you who were at this meeting,
[01:25.120 --> 01:28.080]  it's a meetup that I am
[01:28.080 --> 01:29.880]  co-organizing with some people in
[01:29.880 --> 01:31.720]  the industry here in New York State.
[01:31.720 --> 01:35.760]  This is happening the second Thursday of every month.
[01:35.760 --> 01:38.040]  For those of you who were part of that,
[01:38.040 --> 01:41.320]  I did, I gave a very similar presentation that day.
[01:41.320 --> 01:46.040]  So I am sorry if you were there as well.
[01:46.040 --> 01:49.640]  So I graduated from my PhD in
[01:49.640 --> 01:52.840]  2013 at Indiana University Bloomington,
[01:52.840 --> 01:57.280]  where I studied host and parasite co-evolution.
[01:57.280 --> 02:01.960]  I was thinking a lot about why
[02:01.960 --> 02:03.960]  would individuals reproduce
[02:03.960 --> 02:07.640]  sexually instead of cloning themselves?
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.120]  One of the reasons why you would like
[02:12.120 --> 02:15.640]  sexual reproduction instead of clonal reproduction would
[02:15.640 --> 02:20.080]  be to avoid disease and parasitism,
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.760]  particularly when you have a very taxing disease.
[02:24.760 --> 02:26.520]  So I was thinking about how
[02:26.560 --> 02:28.840]  host and parasites evolved,
[02:28.840 --> 02:32.120]  my degrees in evolutionary biology.
[02:32.120 --> 02:34.920]  This is my advisor, Kurt Lively,
[02:34.920 --> 02:38.840]  at CU, at Indiana University in Bloomington.
[02:39.360 --> 02:42.600]  When I finished my PhD in 2013,
[02:42.600 --> 02:44.400]  I moved to Colorado.
[02:44.400 --> 02:46.800]  I was going to work with Nolan Kane.
[02:46.800 --> 02:49.960]  So he is my postdoc advisor.
[02:49.960 --> 02:54.680]  He was coming from a different side of evolutionary biology,
[02:54.680 --> 02:56.040]  thinking about genomics.
[02:56.080 --> 02:59.320]  So genomics is the entire conglomerate of DNA,
[02:59.320 --> 03:01.800]  of genetic material, of organisms.
[03:01.800 --> 03:04.480]  And he was working with sunflowers.
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.720]  So yeah, so that's what he did in sunflowers,
[03:07.720 --> 03:10.880]  was look at the entire genome of sunflowers.
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.720]  So I joined his lab and I was going to work with sunflowers.
[03:15.720 --> 03:18.000]  But around that same time,
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.200]  they were legalizing cannabis or
[03:21.200 --> 03:25.080]  marijuana recreational use in 2014.
[03:25.120 --> 03:28.080]  So I started working in cannabis instead.
[03:28.080 --> 03:30.640]  And one of the things that really caught my attention
[03:30.640 --> 03:33.440]  was that cannabis reproduces both
[03:33.440 --> 03:34.800]  sexually and asexually.
[03:34.800 --> 03:37.080]  And I was thinking about those things through my PhD.
[03:37.080 --> 03:38.280]  So clonal reproduction.
[03:38.280 --> 03:41.480]  And so cannabis has hermaphrodites and has
[03:41.480 --> 03:43.640]  individuals that are males and females.
[03:43.640 --> 03:46.560]  So it has dioecious and monoecious individuals.
[03:46.560 --> 03:48.560]  So that was really what caught my attention
[03:48.560 --> 03:51.840]  when I started working in cannabis back in 2013.
[03:51.880 --> 03:56.720]  And again, cannabis is part of the family Cannabiasia,
[03:56.720 --> 03:58.160]  along with hops.
[03:58.160 --> 04:01.960]  So hops is its closest existing species.
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.200]  They diverged approximately 25 million years ago.
[04:06.200 --> 04:08.760]  And so they are part of the same family.
[04:08.760 --> 04:11.680]  And again, hops is one of the main ingredients of beer.
[04:13.760 --> 04:15.520]  And they are angiosperms.
[04:15.520 --> 04:17.840]  So they are plants that produce flowers.
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.600]  And what I did mostly was study the genome.
[04:22.360 --> 04:26.120]  So study the DNA and the genes in cannabis.
[04:26.120 --> 04:28.120]  So the whole conglomerate of DNA,
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.880]  of letters of the DNA in an organism.
[04:30.880 --> 04:33.120]  So by definition, what I was doing was working
[04:33.120 --> 04:35.760]  with big data and mostly bioinformatics.
[04:37.240 --> 04:42.240]  And one of the reasons why I was interested in this genomics
[04:43.320 --> 04:48.160]  is because you can draw parallels to how the plant looks.
[04:48.160 --> 04:50.840]  So you can draw parallels between the genotype,
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.160]  the genetic material,
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.280]  and the phenotype, the physical characteristics.
[04:54.280 --> 04:55.960]  So the genotype, the DNA,
[04:55.960 --> 04:59.120]  and the phenotype, the physical characteristics of the plant.
[05:00.520 --> 05:04.520]  And one of the things that I did was to look at the genes
[05:04.520 --> 05:06.840]  that are related to cannabinoid production.
[05:06.840 --> 05:09.000]  There are multiple, multiple cannabinoids here.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.880]  I'm showing two, which are of great importance
[05:11.880 --> 05:13.520]  because they are the drivers
[05:13.520 --> 05:15.960]  of this multibillion dollar industry.
[05:15.960 --> 05:18.080]  However, there's many, many cannabinoids,
[05:18.080 --> 05:20.920]  and I also worked with some of them as well.
[05:22.720 --> 05:26.320]  And I was part of a lot of different publications
[05:26.320 --> 05:31.320]  that for my research while I was there at CU Boulder.
[05:31.720 --> 05:34.920]  In 2017, for example, we published this paper
[05:34.920 --> 05:37.640]  where we looked at the cannabinoids,
[05:37.640 --> 05:40.960]  the six different cannabinoids from the cannabis
[05:40.960 --> 05:43.200]  produced by the federal government.
[05:43.200 --> 05:46.880]  So I'm not sure if some of you maybe know
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.360]  that in order for research to be conducted in cannabis,
[05:51.360 --> 05:54.120]  because it's a schedule one drug,
[05:55.120 --> 05:58.720]  we must use the cannabis produced by the federal government
[05:58.720 --> 06:01.720]  by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA.
[06:03.040 --> 06:06.600]  And so we were able to get a hold of the values,
[06:06.600 --> 06:10.520]  the chemotypes for different cannabinoids produced by NIDA.
[06:10.520 --> 06:11.640]  And I wanna show you a picture.
[06:11.640 --> 06:15.400]  So we got a hold of cannabinoids values
[06:15.400 --> 06:18.240]  for the commercial marijuana that is produced
[06:18.240 --> 06:21.920]  by the private markets and by the government.
[06:21.920 --> 06:23.240]  And this is how it looks.
[06:24.440 --> 06:27.040]  So in this graph, what I'm showing in the Y-axis,
[06:27.040 --> 06:28.400]  which is the vertical axis,
[06:28.400 --> 06:32.840]  is the percent cannabinoids between different locations.
[06:32.840 --> 06:35.360]  We had four different locations for the private market,
[06:35.360 --> 06:38.040]  Denver, Oakland, Sacramento, and Seattle.
[06:38.040 --> 06:41.640]  And we had NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
[06:41.640 --> 06:45.720]  And NIDA differs in CBD and THC
[06:45.720 --> 06:48.120]  is the one that has the lowest values.
[06:49.960 --> 06:54.760]  And when you look at the entire cannabinoid production
[06:54.760 --> 06:56.720]  with this other statistical test,
[06:56.720 --> 06:58.960]  which is called the principal component analysis
[06:58.960 --> 07:02.800]  that allows us to look at the entire cannabinoid diversity,
[07:03.920 --> 07:06.360]  we can see that this diversity can be partitioned
[07:06.360 --> 07:09.720]  into groups, this pink group and this gray group.
[07:09.720 --> 07:13.440]  And NIDA is only part of one of the groups.
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.200]  And then when we look at this diversity by location,
[07:18.200 --> 07:19.920]  Oakland and Sacramento,
[07:19.920 --> 07:24.040]  they contain NIDA's kind of cannabinoid variation,
[07:24.040 --> 07:27.640]  but NIDA does not contain Oakland and Sacramento variation.
[07:29.240 --> 07:31.680]  Then in 2021, so last year,
[07:31.680 --> 07:34.400]  we got another paper published
[07:34.400 --> 07:37.640]  regarding the genome of this NIDA's variety.
[07:37.640 --> 07:39.960]  So I like to think about it like in 2017,
[07:39.960 --> 07:42.880]  we looked at the phenotype or the physical characteristics.
[07:42.880 --> 07:46.200]  And then in 2021, we looked at the genotype.
[07:46.200 --> 07:50.240]  So at the genome of these varieties,
[07:50.240 --> 07:54.240]  which were very, I'm not gonna go into details,
[07:54.240 --> 07:58.640]  but it was very limited, the amount of genetic diversity.
[08:00.320 --> 08:02.560]  So this is very important
[08:02.560 --> 08:07.560]  because most medical studies
[08:07.600 --> 08:11.520]  are used using the governmentally produced cannabis.
[08:12.480 --> 08:15.000]  And this review paper in 2018,
[08:15.000 --> 08:16.640]  found that cannabis is only useful
[08:16.640 --> 08:18.880]  for three different conditions,
[08:18.880 --> 08:23.240]  pain in adults, chemotherapy-induced nausea,
[08:23.240 --> 08:27.080]  and spasticity in multiple sclerosis.
[08:27.080 --> 08:29.240]  And perhaps they only found that cannabis
[08:29.240 --> 08:30.880]  is useful for three conditions
[08:30.880 --> 08:35.560]  because they are using a source that has limited diversity,
[08:35.560 --> 08:37.680]  both in the physical characteristics,
[08:37.680 --> 08:40.360]  in the cannabinoids and in the genome.
[08:40.360 --> 08:43.360]  So they're not using the cannabis
[08:43.360 --> 08:47.040]  that people regularly use in private markets.
[08:48.760 --> 08:51.920]  And again, this is how the medical marijuana
[08:51.920 --> 08:53.240]  from private markets looks
[08:53.240 --> 08:56.520]  versus the one that is produced by the government.
[08:56.520 --> 08:58.440]  I also worked with hops a little bit.
[08:58.440 --> 09:01.600]  So I was part of the assembly of the chloroplast genome.
[09:01.600 --> 09:04.840]  So the chloroplast is this organ in the plant,
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.800]  really important organ for photosynthesis,
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.360]  and it has a genome of its own.
[09:08.360 --> 09:11.000]  And basically what we did is that we pieced,
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.280]  so we pieced that genome together.
[09:14.280 --> 09:19.200]  And this was actually my first paper in cannabis in 2015.
[09:19.200 --> 09:21.360]  And I also worked with hops and cannabis
[09:21.360 --> 09:23.640]  while describing the cannabinoid genes.
[09:24.440 --> 09:26.200]  I'm not gonna go again into detail,
[09:26.200 --> 09:28.240]  but I'm happy to talk to you about it
[09:28.240 --> 09:30.040]  if you are curious about it.
[09:30.040 --> 09:31.360]  But part of this research
[09:31.360 --> 09:33.680]  while looking at the cannabinoid genes in cannabis,
[09:33.680 --> 09:35.800]  and I use similar genes in hops,
[09:35.800 --> 09:38.520]  this was published in 2019.
[09:40.800 --> 09:45.800]  I was part of different private companies,
[09:47.040 --> 09:50.400]  Steep Hill, which is a testing facility,
[09:50.400 --> 09:53.160]  and they have testing facilities all over the US.
[09:53.160 --> 09:55.400]  So I was part of their team.
[09:55.400 --> 09:58.040]  And then I was part of the Front Range Biosciences team.
[09:58.040 --> 10:00.320]  So these companies would fund me,
[10:00.320 --> 10:03.120]  fund my research at CU Boulder
[10:03.120 --> 10:05.000]  with data provided by Steep Hill.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.160]  We published this paper from NIDA that I just showed you.
[10:09.160 --> 10:13.120]  And then in 2020, we had another statistical analysis
[10:13.120 --> 10:15.640]  where we used machine learning
[10:15.640 --> 10:17.600]  to look at different cannabinoids
[10:17.600 --> 10:20.480]  and the missing values of different cannabinoids.
[10:20.480 --> 10:23.840]  And also in 2021, I was part of this study
[10:23.840 --> 10:26.720]  where we looked at the different physical characteristics
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.320]  of traits that are important for the industry.
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.720]  I am gonna be talking about this particular paper
[10:33.720 --> 10:36.880]  on this seminars that are co-organized
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.120]  between USDA and Cornell.
[10:39.120 --> 10:40.640]  And my talk is on 420.
[10:40.640 --> 10:42.920]  So I hope that I see you there as well.
[10:44.240 --> 10:48.480]  And I also started a nonprofit organization,
[10:48.480 --> 10:50.240]  the Agricultural Genomics Foundation
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.800]  that aims in bringing cannabis knowledge to a broad public.
[10:54.800 --> 10:57.880]  Through AGF, we have a podcast, Cannabis Science Today.
[10:57.880 --> 10:59.080]  I highly recommend it.
[10:59.080 --> 11:02.280]  And we also have a class, Modern Cannabis Science
[11:02.280 --> 11:05.440]  that is taught at CU Boulder.
[11:05.440 --> 11:06.680]  And it's open to the public
[11:06.680 --> 11:10.200]  because it's taught through continuing education.
[11:10.200 --> 11:15.200]  So I made a lot of professional relationships
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.760]  during my time in Colorado
[11:18.760 --> 11:20.840]  and personal relationships as well.
[11:21.720 --> 11:26.480]  And then I moved here to New York in October.
[11:26.480 --> 11:28.000]  I started this position
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.280]  at the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[11:31.160 --> 11:33.720]  I am starting to get to know a bunch of people
[11:33.720 --> 11:35.640]  in the industry, which is really exciting.
[11:35.640 --> 11:40.200]  And as time passes, I hope that this slide gets busier
[11:40.200 --> 11:42.800]  and busier with multiple other companies.
[11:42.800 --> 11:47.120]  One of my tasks right now is to work on an introduction,
[11:47.120 --> 11:50.680]  a manual, a hemp production manual.
[11:50.680 --> 11:53.960]  And this has been a very collaborative work
[11:53.960 --> 11:57.240]  in the survey that I'm gonna put a link
[11:57.240 --> 12:00.680]  or Mary or Janice are gonna put a link in the chat.
[12:03.280 --> 12:05.960]  We hope to have people join us with this endeavor.
[12:05.960 --> 12:09.640]  So if you wanna be part of it, please give us our email,
[12:09.640 --> 12:12.440]  give us your email in the survey.
[12:12.440 --> 12:16.000]  And my idea is to build a cannabis community
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.360]  here in New York State and to establish myself
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.960]  as kind of the middleman
[12:19.960 --> 12:22.320]  between the industry and researchers
[12:22.320 --> 12:24.480]  and to develop research and outreach programs
[12:24.480 --> 12:26.280]  that are gonna serve the community
[12:26.280 --> 12:29.760]  and help this nascent industry thrive.
[12:29.760 --> 12:34.400]  Again, all of this is a collaborative endeavor
[12:34.400 --> 12:37.120]  with the manual and also with other things
[12:37.120 --> 12:39.440]  that we're gonna be developing in the future.
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.360]  And I would like to be part of building this industry
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.720]  and answer many questions together.
[12:45.880 --> 12:48.520]  I think that there will be room for multiple businesses
[12:48.520 --> 12:49.800]  within the industry.
[12:49.800 --> 12:53.200]  Not everyone has to be a grower or a producer
[12:53.200 --> 12:55.200]  and there will be multiple,
[12:55.200 --> 12:58.720]  there will be plenty of room for ancillary businesses.
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.280]  And we're all learning how to process cannabis together.
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.040]  So that's something that we are in this together.
[13:07.040 --> 13:09.760]  And again, this is my email, my website.
[13:09.760 --> 13:12.000]  And with that, I will answer questions
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.160]  if you have any questions.
[13:13.160 --> 13:14.000]  Thank you.
[13:15.000 --> 13:15.840]  All right.
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.920]  Today, we're gonna talk about hemp micropropagation.
[13:18.920 --> 13:20.800]  Originally, this was supposed to be a live
[13:20.800 --> 13:22.720]  how-to demonstration.
[13:22.720 --> 13:25.160]  However, due to the COVID related issues,
[13:25.160 --> 13:27.960]  this is gonna be our PowerPoint presentation.
[13:27.960 --> 13:29.040]  So let me begin.
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.240]  I'm stationed at Cornell University satellite location,
[13:34.240 --> 13:35.920]  the Long Island Horticultural Research
[13:35.920 --> 13:38.120]  and Extension Center in Riverhead.
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.370]  This year, we are celebrating
[13:44.650 --> 13:46.170]  our 100th anniversary.
[13:46.170 --> 13:48.610]  And I want to invite you down for plant science day
[13:48.610 --> 13:50.010]  on September 15th.
[13:51.970 --> 13:55.450]  Before I begin to speak about hemp micropropagation,
[13:55.450 --> 13:57.370]  I wanna take a few seconds just to tell you
[13:57.370 --> 13:58.970]  a little bit about our center.
[13:58.970 --> 14:00.210]  We are located in the heart
[14:00.210 --> 14:03.290]  of Suffolk County's agricultural industry.
[14:03.290 --> 14:05.330]  We are the only horticultural research center
[14:05.330 --> 14:07.890]  in the United States that has professional scientists
[14:07.890 --> 14:10.610]  who represent each of the horticultural commodities,
[14:10.610 --> 14:13.530]  floriculture and greenhouses, fruits and viticulture,
[14:13.730 --> 14:17.730]  vegetables and woody ornamentals and landscape plants.
[14:17.730 --> 14:19.210]  In addition, we have specialists
[14:19.210 --> 14:21.050]  for the cross disciplines too.
[14:21.050 --> 14:23.850]  We have two plant pathologists, a weed scientist
[14:23.850 --> 14:25.290]  and two entomologists.
[14:25.290 --> 14:27.890]  I represent the discipline of plant tissue culture
[14:27.890 --> 14:29.490]  that we're gonna discuss today.
[14:37.460 --> 14:42.960]  Our research center is located down
[14:42.960 --> 14:44.760]  at the East end of Long Island.
[14:44.760 --> 14:47.440]  It is a little more than 300 miles from Ithaca.
[14:47.440 --> 14:49.560]  It's a long drive, but if you get a chance to visit,
[14:49.600 --> 14:52.040]  you will be surprised at the beauty of Eastern Long Island
[14:52.040 --> 14:54.280]  and the amount of plant agriculture.
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.360]  Due to our unique maritime climate, good soils,
[14:57.360 --> 14:59.720]  high sunlight and other environmental factors,
[14:59.720 --> 15:01.120]  we are still the number one county
[15:01.120 --> 15:02.680]  for greenhouses in New York,
[15:02.680 --> 15:04.520]  as well as ornamental nurseries.
[15:04.520 --> 15:06.680]  We have more than 2000 acres of grapes
[15:06.680 --> 15:09.600]  and grow more than a hundred different kinds of vegetables.
[15:11.280 --> 15:14.520]  Okay, that's the end of my short little commercial
[15:14.520 --> 15:16.400]  for our anniversary.
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.440]  We're here today to discuss about plant tissue culture
[15:20.320 --> 15:23.320]  and more specifically plant micro propagation.
[15:23.320 --> 15:25.120]  Plant tissue culture is the growth of plants
[15:25.120 --> 15:27.280]  on a sterile nutrient medium in vitro
[15:27.280 --> 15:29.680]  under controlled environmental conditions.
[15:29.680 --> 15:32.080]  There are several uses for plant tissue culture.
[15:32.080 --> 15:35.120]  It can be used for plant breeding, disease elimination,
[15:35.120 --> 15:38.360]  basic research, nutritional studies and much more.
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.080]  Today we are focusing on the applied technique
[15:41.080 --> 15:42.520]  of micro propagation.
[15:44.480 --> 15:48.040]  Plant micro propagation is one use for plant tissue culture.
[15:48.360 --> 15:50.120]  This technique is used specifically
[15:50.120 --> 15:53.240]  for the clonal propagation of plants in vitro.
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.160]  This is a photo of our lab on Long Island.
[15:57.160 --> 16:01.760]  We also have a micro propagation lab on campus in Ithaca.
[16:01.760 --> 16:04.600]  Basically you need to have a location to prepare media,
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.560]  autoclave it, laminar airflow hoods to transfer plants
[16:08.560 --> 16:11.760]  and grow chambers or light racks to grow plants.
[16:11.760 --> 16:13.320]  Everything that you see here,
[16:13.320 --> 16:15.680]  you would also see in a commercial laboratory.
[16:18.400 --> 16:19.640]  Why is there such interest
[16:19.640 --> 16:22.560]  in using plant micro propagation for hemp?
[16:22.560 --> 16:25.040]  The main reason that micro propagation is popular
[16:25.040 --> 16:26.760]  is that it is a rapid procedure
[16:26.760 --> 16:29.240]  to asexually propagate clones.
[16:29.240 --> 16:32.120]  Because the female plants of hemp are the most valuable,
[16:32.120 --> 16:35.480]  it is desirable to propagate all female plants.
[16:35.480 --> 16:37.640]  The plants that are produced by micro propagation
[16:37.640 --> 16:40.000]  are clean and disease-free.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.240]  With new virus problems popping up with hemp,
[16:42.240 --> 16:44.200]  it is nice to have a clean source of plants
[16:44.200 --> 16:45.960]  that grow vigorously.
[16:45.960 --> 16:48.000]  In addition, this technique does not require
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.840]  a large amount of space to produce the plants.
[16:50.840 --> 16:53.040]  Micro propagation requires less maintenance
[16:53.040 --> 16:56.400]  than plants that are grown in a greenhouse or field
[16:56.400 --> 16:58.480]  and year round production is possible.
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.280]  For the past two and a half years,
[17:02.280 --> 17:04.840]  our lab has been working on the micro propagation of hemp.
[17:04.840 --> 17:06.880]  We've been studying the various factors
[17:06.880 --> 17:09.960]  that influence the growth of this plant in vitro.
[17:09.960 --> 17:11.480]  The medium on which the plants grow
[17:11.480 --> 17:13.840]  has several reasons to succeed or fail.
[17:13.840 --> 17:16.440]  So each aspect needed to be evaluated.
[17:16.440 --> 17:18.320]  We examined the plant's nutrition,
[17:18.320 --> 17:20.240]  amount of sugar for optimum growth,
[17:20.240 --> 17:21.520]  gelling agents for the medium,
[17:21.520 --> 17:23.120]  and the hormones that allowed the plants
[17:23.120 --> 17:24.480]  to grow most vigorously.
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.680]  In addition to the growing medium,
[17:27.680 --> 17:30.440]  we also examined other environmental factors on hemp.
[17:31.480 --> 17:33.960]  We looked at the type of explant that was used,
[17:33.960 --> 17:35.640]  the temperature to grow the plants,
[17:35.640 --> 17:37.640]  and the medium pH levels.
[17:37.640 --> 17:41.080]  I will tell you what the key items for success are,
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.240]  the ones that we found as we go through this presentation.
[17:47.160 --> 17:49.480]  There are five stages of micro propagations
[17:49.480 --> 17:52.280]  and I will review each one of these in detail.
[17:52.280 --> 17:53.520]  First, there is stage O,
[17:53.520 --> 17:56.160]  stock plant selection and preparation.
[17:57.040 --> 17:59.280]  Stage one is the disinfection and introduction
[17:59.280 --> 18:01.240]  of plant material into tissue culture.
[18:02.160 --> 18:05.240]  Stage two is the multiplication stage.
[18:05.240 --> 18:08.360]  Stage three is rooting and stage four is acclimation
[18:08.360 --> 18:09.600]  out of the culture vessel.
[18:09.920 --> 18:11.960]  Okay, I'm gonna give you a spoiler alert now.
[18:11.960 --> 18:13.360]  We found at the end of this research
[18:13.360 --> 18:16.200]  that stages three and four can be combined for hemp.
[18:16.200 --> 18:17.480]  And this shortens the process,
[18:17.480 --> 18:20.280]  decreased costs and increased efficiency.
[18:22.240 --> 18:25.560]  Stage O is for stock plant selection and preparation.
[18:25.560 --> 18:27.600]  Remembering that micro propagation allows you
[18:27.600 --> 18:29.840]  to produce hundreds of thousands of plants,
[18:29.840 --> 18:31.520]  hundreds or thousands of plants,
[18:31.520 --> 18:34.400]  it is critical that you begin with the correct cultivar.
[18:34.400 --> 18:36.680]  It is best to begin with plants that are healthy,
[18:36.680 --> 18:38.560]  well-fertilized and disease-free.
[18:40.240 --> 18:42.760]  Results of the plant's growth can sometimes be affected
[18:42.760 --> 18:45.480]  by the time of year in the plants are placed in vitro.
[18:45.480 --> 18:48.160]  The day length in which the plants are growing,
[18:48.160 --> 18:50.800]  the light intensity and several other environmental factors
[18:50.800 --> 18:52.280]  can affect the plant growth.
[18:54.120 --> 18:56.040]  During our research, we examined the effects
[18:56.040 --> 18:57.520]  of where the stock plants were grown
[18:57.520 --> 18:59.680]  on the establishment in vitro.
[18:59.680 --> 19:01.600]  Generally, X plants that are taken from plants
[19:01.600 --> 19:02.520]  that are grown in the field
[19:02.520 --> 19:05.360]  are the most difficult to establish in vitro.
[19:05.360 --> 19:07.080]  X plants that are taken from plants
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.880]  that are grown in a greenhouse have a better chance.
[19:09.880 --> 19:11.280]  And those that are taken from plants
[19:11.280 --> 19:13.600]  that are grown in a growth chamber are best.
[19:13.600 --> 19:15.560]  By removing plant material from plants
[19:15.560 --> 19:18.240]  that are growing in a clean environment,
[19:18.240 --> 19:20.920]  you increase your chance of success at stage one.
[19:22.480 --> 19:23.920]  Stage one is the initiation
[19:23.920 --> 19:26.080]  and establishment in vitro phase.
[19:26.080 --> 19:28.160]  Usually a simple diluted bleach solution
[19:28.160 --> 19:30.120]  is used to clean plant material.
[19:30.120 --> 19:34.120]  We tested various levels of Clorox bleach for 10 minutes
[19:34.160 --> 19:37.600]  to see how well the plants were cleaned.
[19:39.640 --> 19:41.200]  You can see some of our results here
[19:41.200 --> 19:43.960]  and there are two important takeaway observations.
[19:43.960 --> 19:46.160]  First, X plants that were removed from plants
[19:46.160 --> 19:48.280]  that were grown in the growth chamber
[19:48.280 --> 19:50.400]  had a much higher success rate than X plants
[19:50.400 --> 19:51.400]  that were taken from plants
[19:51.400 --> 19:53.240]  that were grown in the greenhouse.
[19:53.240 --> 19:57.560]  Second, the 20%, 40% and 60% bleach treatments
[19:57.560 --> 20:00.120]  all had excellent cleaning abilities on the X plants
[20:00.120 --> 20:02.080]  that were taken from the growth chamber.
[20:02.080 --> 20:03.640]  Any of these levels worked fine
[20:04.160 --> 20:06.080]  and there's no damage to the plant material.
[20:06.080 --> 20:07.400]  Based on these findings,
[20:07.400 --> 20:09.760]  we recommend 20% bleach for 10 minutes
[20:09.760 --> 20:11.840]  to clean X plants for culture.
[20:14.960 --> 20:16.520]  Other ways to improve your chances
[20:16.520 --> 20:20.040]  of obtaining a clean plant during stage one
[20:20.040 --> 20:22.720]  is to use new shoots when possible.
[20:22.720 --> 20:26.120]  They are cleaner from fungi and bacteria than older shoots.
[20:26.120 --> 20:29.360]  Remember your X plants from, I'm sorry,
[20:29.360 --> 20:31.360]  remove your X plants from young plants.
[20:31.360 --> 20:34.360]  They are better to respond than older plants.
[20:34.400 --> 20:36.760]  Juvenile plants work better than adult plants.
[20:38.640 --> 20:40.320]  One of the things about stage one
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.240]  is that if it wasn't successful,
[20:42.240 --> 20:46.800]  you will visibly see contamination within three to five days.
[20:46.800 --> 20:47.640]  Here on the screen,
[20:47.640 --> 20:50.480]  you see different examples of fungal and bacterial attack
[20:50.480 --> 20:52.400]  after unsuccessful stage one.
[20:54.240 --> 20:57.000]  The objective of stage two is the rapid multiplication
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.120]  or propagation of propagules.
[20:59.120 --> 21:02.000]  During stage two, the plant material from stage one
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.480]  is repeatedly subcultured
[21:03.480 --> 21:06.720]  until the desired number of plants are obtained.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.800]  A key part of the success of stage two
[21:10.800 --> 21:13.200]  is the choice of cytokinins and auxins,
[21:13.200 --> 21:16.120]  as well as the concentrations of each that are used.
[21:16.120 --> 21:17.880]  This is a photo of five different media
[21:17.880 --> 21:20.960]  that were used to grow the same African violet plants.
[21:20.960 --> 21:22.880]  Media that had cytokinins
[21:24.600 --> 21:27.520]  and low levels of auxins are on the left.
[21:27.520 --> 21:28.920]  As you move to the right,
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.760]  the levels of cytokinin decrease
[21:30.760 --> 21:32.920]  and the levels of auxins increase.
[21:32.920 --> 21:34.880]  You can see how the hormone level in the medium
[21:34.880 --> 21:36.840]  can affect the growth of the plant.
[21:36.840 --> 21:39.800]  More shoots are obtained with higher levels of cytokinin
[21:39.800 --> 21:42.000]  and roots or callus can be produced
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.200]  when cytokinin is absent and auxin levels are high.
[21:47.320 --> 21:49.200]  During stage two, there are four techniques
[21:49.200 --> 21:51.440]  that can be used to micropropagate plants.
[21:51.440 --> 21:55.080]  However, there is only one that can be guaranteed
[21:55.080 --> 21:57.120]  to produce genetically identical clones,
[21:57.120 --> 21:59.000]  and that is number A on this list.
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.720]  Use organized growing points
[22:00.720 --> 22:03.640]  such as shoot tips and axillary buds.
[22:03.640 --> 22:05.920]  There are other ways to generate plants during stage two,
[22:05.920 --> 22:08.240]  such as somatic embrogenesis,
[22:08.240 --> 22:11.280]  adventitious shoot production, and seed propagation,
[22:11.280 --> 22:13.720]  but none of these techniques can guarantee clones,
[22:13.720 --> 22:15.560]  so I will not discuss them today.
[22:17.240 --> 22:19.320]  We found that hemp plants usually grow in vitro
[22:19.320 --> 22:20.520]  by growing a single shoot
[22:20.520 --> 22:23.080]  with no or very little axillary branching.
[22:23.080 --> 22:27.640]  This is an acceptable way to micropropagate these plants.
[22:27.640 --> 22:29.560]  Plants such as lilacs, rhododendrons,
[22:29.560 --> 22:32.320]  mountain laurels, and others will grow in vitro
[22:32.320 --> 22:34.720]  by producing multiple axillary branches.
[22:34.720 --> 22:36.760]  Hemp does not respond this way.
[22:39.280 --> 22:41.520]  As I mentioned earlier, during our stage two research,
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.720]  we focused on several different media factors
[22:43.720 --> 22:45.160]  for optimal growth.
[22:45.160 --> 22:46.560]  We looked at sugar levels,
[22:46.560 --> 22:48.280]  and by the way, for plant tissue culture,
[22:48.280 --> 22:50.880]  you can use plain old table sugar.
[22:50.880 --> 22:53.160]  We compared levels from no sugar at all
[22:53.160 --> 22:56.000]  all the way up to 60 grams per liter,
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.040]  usually 30 grams per liter is the standard.
[23:00.240 --> 23:02.320]  We found that either 15 grams per liter
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.640]  or 30 grams per liter were the best levels to grow hemp.
[23:05.640 --> 23:09.120]  We chose to use 15 grams per liter because it saves money
[23:09.120 --> 23:10.800]  and you get the same results.
[23:12.840 --> 23:14.360]  We also compared four different
[23:14.360 --> 23:16.280]  commercial media formulations,
[23:16.280 --> 23:18.880]  Murashige and Skoug, indicated by MS,
[23:18.880 --> 23:21.600]  Linsmeyer and Skoug, LS,
[23:21.600 --> 23:24.800]  Driver and Kuniyuki Walnut Media, DKW,
[23:24.800 --> 23:28.920]  as well as Lloyd and McCown's Woody Plant Medium, the WPM.
[23:28.920 --> 23:31.920]  All the first three media performed equally well.
[23:31.920 --> 23:33.840]  The only medium that had poor plant growth
[23:33.840 --> 23:35.960]  was the WPM medium.
[23:35.960 --> 23:38.840]  MS medium is the industry standard around the world,
[23:38.840 --> 23:41.600]  and we recommend that medium because of convenience.
[23:43.360 --> 23:45.040]  We also compared gelling agents
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.840]  in the micropropagation medium.
[23:46.840 --> 23:47.960]  We compared agar,
[23:47.960 --> 23:50.280]  which is the most commonly used gelling agent,
[23:50.280 --> 23:53.600]  to gel and gum, which is a water-soluble polysaccharide.
[23:53.600 --> 23:55.560]  Commercially, it's called Gelrite.
[23:55.560 --> 23:57.000]  And then we also compared these
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.880]  to an agar-gellin combination.
[23:59.880 --> 24:01.800]  There were no significant differences
[24:01.800 --> 24:03.760]  between these three gelling agents.
[24:03.760 --> 24:06.760]  Any can be used at their recommended concentrations.
[24:08.880 --> 24:11.680]  We also compared the X-Plant source for stage two.
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.320]  We compared shoot tips to nodal sections.
[24:14.320 --> 24:16.880]  There were no differences between shoot tips and nodes.
[24:16.880 --> 24:19.160]  Either can be used equally well.
[24:19.160 --> 24:21.720]  This is a good thing for commercial propagators.
[24:24.440 --> 24:27.000]  Another batch of experiments focused on the pH levels
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.360]  of the medium for micropropagation of hemp.
[24:29.360 --> 24:33.680]  We tested pH levels of four, five, 5.8,
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.000]  which is the industry standard, six, and seven.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.400]  We found that the best pH levels were 5.8, six, and seven.
[24:41.400 --> 24:44.720]  We recommend that the standard pH level of 5.8
[24:44.720 --> 24:45.720]  be used for hemp.
[24:48.160 --> 24:50.200]  The optimum growing temperature for hemp
[24:50.200 --> 24:51.880]  was also not known.
[24:51.880 --> 24:56.000]  We grew hemp plants in four different growing temperatures.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.680]  We went from as low as 22 degrees Celsius,
[25:00.680 --> 25:02.240]  also 72 degrees Fahrenheit,
[25:02.240 --> 25:04.360]  all the way up to 28 degrees Celsius,
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.560]  about 82 degrees Fahrenheit.
[25:06.560 --> 25:10.400]  The two warmest temperatures, 26 degrees and 28 degrees,
[25:10.400 --> 25:12.280]  had the best plant growth.
[25:12.280 --> 25:14.840]  These are recommended for hemp micropropagation.
[25:16.960 --> 25:18.840]  A major set of experiments examined
[25:18.840 --> 25:21.680]  different possible cytokinins and different levels of each.
[25:22.480 --> 25:25.080]  We compared benzo-amino-purine, BA,
[25:25.080 --> 25:27.400]  to isopentanyl adenine, 2IP,
[25:27.400 --> 25:31.640]  as well as to thiazurone, which is indicated by TDZ.
[25:31.640 --> 25:32.920]  This is not a cytokinin,
[25:32.920 --> 25:36.240]  but it is a chemical that has cytokinin-like activities.
[25:36.240 --> 25:40.360]  Each were compared at one, five, or 10 micromolar levels.
[25:40.360 --> 25:44.040]  The lower rates of 2IP or BA performed the best.
[25:44.040 --> 25:46.080]  These growth regulators produced more shoots
[25:46.080 --> 25:49.040]  than the control plants that had no growth regulators.
[25:49.040 --> 25:51.960]  These two cytokinins are what we recommend for hemp
[25:51.960 --> 25:53.480]  at the lower concentrations.
[25:54.480 --> 25:57.200]  TDZ produced cultures with greater number of nodes,
[25:57.200 --> 26:00.080]  but the shoots were short and callus was generated.
[26:00.080 --> 26:03.480]  Thiazurone is not recommended because it produces callus.
[26:03.480 --> 26:05.040]  Mutations are highly likely
[26:05.040 --> 26:07.880]  when plants are produced indirectly through callus.
[26:09.800 --> 26:12.360]  The last two stages of micropropagation that we studied
[26:12.360 --> 26:14.560]  were stage three and stage four.
[26:14.560 --> 26:17.240]  Stage three is used in traditional micropropagation
[26:17.240 --> 26:18.600]  for root initiation.
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.760]  Stage four is used to harden off or acclimate plants.
[26:24.400 --> 26:26.720]  Stage three for root initiation
[26:26.720 --> 26:29.280]  is to transfer the hemp plants to a new medium
[26:29.280 --> 26:30.880]  with either no cytokinin
[26:30.880 --> 26:33.840]  or to a medium that includes an auxin.
[26:33.840 --> 26:36.760]  We compared the two most commonly used auxins,
[26:36.760 --> 26:39.200]  NAA, which is naphthalene acetic acid,
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.480]  and IBA, indole-3-butyric acid.
[26:42.480 --> 26:44.400]  We compared them at four different levels.
[26:44.400 --> 26:46.560]  We had a control with no auxin,
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.600]  0.5 micromole, 0.5 micromole, and 2.5 micromole each.
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.120]  We are recommending 2.5 micromole IBA for rooting hemp.
[26:58.120 --> 27:01.680]  But as you can see here, roots are also possible with NAA.
[27:01.680 --> 27:04.680]  There was a lot of callus produced when NAA was the auxin.
[27:04.680 --> 27:06.960]  And because we do not want to encourage callus,
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.360]  we think that IBA is the way to go.
[27:11.560 --> 27:13.920]  Stage four is the acclimation or hardening off
[27:13.920 --> 27:16.000]  of micropropagated plants.
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.480]  Tissue culture plants are grown in 100% relative humidity.
[27:19.480 --> 27:22.400]  So the plants do not form cuticle wax on their leaves.
[27:22.400 --> 27:24.720]  They cannot be removed from tissue culture
[27:24.720 --> 27:27.360]  and placed outside in the greenhouse or field.
[27:27.360 --> 27:28.720]  They must be hardened off.
[27:29.640 --> 27:31.560]  This humidity surrounding the plant
[27:31.560 --> 27:33.800]  needs to be gradually decreased.
[27:33.800 --> 27:36.560]  Because the process to generate a waxy cuticle on a leaf
[27:36.560 --> 27:39.640]  will only take 24 hours under good conditions,
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.880]  you can simply crack open the culture vessel overnight.
[27:43.880 --> 27:44.920]  Most often, however,
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.720]  plants are removed from culture
[27:46.720 --> 27:49.200]  and transplanted into greenhouse medium.
[27:49.200 --> 27:52.080]  They are then placed in a high humidity environment
[27:52.080 --> 27:55.160]  and then has the humidity lowered gradually.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.200]  Another thing to do to micropropagated plants
[28:00.200 --> 28:01.640]  when they were removed from tissue culture
[28:01.640 --> 28:05.440]  is to gradually increase light intensity and photo period.
[28:05.440 --> 28:07.920]  Plants in tissue culture do not photosynthesize well
[28:07.920 --> 28:10.840]  because they have a sugar source in the medium.
[28:10.840 --> 28:12.640]  By increasing the light levels
[28:12.640 --> 28:14.360]  and also giving them long days,
[28:14.800 --> 28:17.600]  the plants will begin to photosynthesize and grow better.
[28:19.560 --> 28:22.360]  Some stage four experiments compared acclimating
[28:22.360 --> 28:25.200]  and rooting hemp plants under intermittent mist
[28:25.200 --> 28:26.960]  or under a plastic dome.
[28:26.960 --> 28:29.440]  We also applied rooting hormone to some of the plants
[28:29.440 --> 28:32.040]  and no rooting hormone to the other half
[28:32.040 --> 28:34.280]  to determine if rooting was improved
[28:34.280 --> 28:36.000]  by the application of auxin.
[28:37.840 --> 28:39.800]  The plants on the right side of the slide
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.040]  were rooted and acclimated under a plastic dome.
[28:44.720 --> 28:45.800]  And the plants on the left side
[28:45.800 --> 28:48.200]  were placed under greenhouse intermittent mist.
[28:49.840 --> 28:52.760]  Plants that were grown under plastic domes rooted faster
[28:52.760 --> 28:54.200]  and the plants were healthier than plants
[28:54.200 --> 28:56.000]  that were placed under the mist.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.480]  The application of rooting hormone
[28:57.480 --> 29:00.160]  did not have any advantage to the rooting process.
[29:00.160 --> 29:02.000]  We found that rooting and hardening off
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.640]  of micropropagated plants
[29:03.640 --> 29:06.640]  can easily be done together at stage four.
[29:06.640 --> 29:10.480]  For hemp plants, there is no need to go through a stage three.
[29:10.480 --> 29:13.560]  Time and money can be saved by combining these two stages.
[29:15.040 --> 29:17.120]  Okay, that's everything you need to know
[29:17.120 --> 29:20.680]  about micropropagation of hemp in just 20 minutes.
[29:20.680 --> 29:21.760]  I appreciate your attention.
[29:21.760 --> 29:23.400]  I hope this was helpful.
[29:23.400 --> 29:25.200]  I wanna thank the young people in this photo.
[29:25.200 --> 29:27.240]  They are the members of both our Ithaca Lab
[29:27.240 --> 29:28.520]  and our Long Island Lab.
[29:28.520 --> 29:31.000]  They do the real work for this research.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.640]  Thanks again, and I can answer some questions now
[29:33.640 --> 29:34.520]  if there are any.
[29:37.580 --> 29:40.620]  Okay, I'm gonna have one, maybe it was everybody else.
[29:40.620 --> 29:42.660]  So you're talking about callusing.
[29:42.660 --> 29:44.780]  Why is that bad?
[29:44.980 --> 29:45.820]  What is it?
[29:47.060 --> 29:50.380]  Okay, callus is just a group of unorganized cells,
[29:50.380 --> 29:52.180]  parenchyma cells, basically.
[29:52.180 --> 29:57.180]  And when a plant is regenerated from a callus cell,
[29:58.900 --> 30:00.860]  there is a much greater chance
[30:00.860 --> 30:02.660]  that there's a mutation that occurs.
[30:04.420 --> 30:06.540]  For this situation, we want clones.
[30:06.540 --> 30:07.820]  So if we want clones,
[30:07.820 --> 30:10.900]  we need to start off with a organized growing point,
[30:10.900 --> 30:12.820]  which are basically the shoot tip
[30:12.820 --> 30:15.100]  or those shoots in the axillary buds.
[30:16.380 --> 30:17.380]  Okay, cool, thanks.
[30:17.380 --> 30:19.260]  Which is why you don't want it early on,
[30:19.260 --> 30:21.780]  because then you're gonna take that first plant
[30:21.780 --> 30:24.340]  and make other little copies from that one.
[30:24.340 --> 30:27.660]  And so you don't want callus form on that first.
[30:27.660 --> 30:28.500]  That's right.
[30:28.500 --> 30:30.260]  So that, okay, now I get it.
[30:31.380 --> 30:32.820]  Well, thanks a lot, Mary.
[30:32.820 --> 30:33.940]  Thanks for the invitation.
[30:33.940 --> 30:35.580]  Good afternoon, everybody.
[30:35.580 --> 30:39.900]  I'd like to actually jump in on your comment there, Mary,
[30:39.900 --> 30:42.780]  that even though I've been looking fairly intensively
[30:43.620 --> 30:45.900]  at some of these, particularly foliar diseases on hemp
[30:45.900 --> 30:48.620]  over the last several years,
[30:48.620 --> 30:52.140]  it's still awful nice to have a microscope back at the lab
[30:52.140 --> 30:55.300]  and the ability to grow these things out,
[30:55.300 --> 31:00.020]  because there's just enough difference between cultivars,
[31:01.300 --> 31:04.300]  the genetics of hemp and the environment location
[31:04.300 --> 31:06.940]  that you can still get pretty easily fooled.
[31:06.940 --> 31:09.540]  So I don't wanna start out making you all think
[31:09.540 --> 31:11.660]  that you can just take a look and know what it is
[31:11.700 --> 31:14.220]  by comparing it to some picture book.
[31:14.220 --> 31:17.540]  But let me share some of the things we've been finding.
[31:17.540 --> 31:21.060]  And for starters, I wanna acknowledge
[31:21.060 --> 31:23.260]  when I started into this work,
[31:23.260 --> 31:26.420]  there is not a heck of a lot out there,
[31:26.420 --> 31:28.100]  or wasn't at the time,
[31:28.100 --> 31:30.580]  and the literature is building nicely now,
[31:30.580 --> 31:35.580]  but I wanna say hats off to J.M. McPartland,
[31:35.860 --> 31:39.820]  who is actually a physician who was interested
[31:39.820 --> 31:44.820]  in some of the medical psychoactive portions
[31:45.380 --> 31:47.260]  of the hemp plant.
[31:47.260 --> 31:51.020]  And he did put out a beautiful textbook at the time
[31:51.020 --> 31:53.340]  on hemp diseases and pests.
[31:53.340 --> 31:55.540]  And that's been a great starting point
[31:55.540 --> 31:58.100]  for learning about a lot of these things.
[31:59.620 --> 32:01.700]  So let's start with some of the ones
[32:01.700 --> 32:04.060]  that are kind of universal,
[32:04.060 --> 32:07.540]  that if you grow hemp for much time at all,
[32:07.540 --> 32:10.020]  you're probably gonna run into white mold.
[32:10.020 --> 32:15.020]  And this is caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
[32:15.260 --> 32:19.740]  It's the fungus with a very wide host range,
[32:19.740 --> 32:21.740]  and is problematic in New York
[32:21.740 --> 32:23.900]  on a number of our vegetable crops,
[32:23.900 --> 32:27.260]  one of our biggest problems on soybean production.
[32:27.260 --> 32:29.180]  So this is soil-borne.
[32:29.180 --> 32:32.140]  The overwintering stage of the fungus
[32:32.140 --> 32:35.860]  is these hardened bodies called sclerotia
[32:35.860 --> 32:40.660]  that reside on the soil surface or within the soil.
[32:40.660 --> 32:44.220]  And white mold results from that,
[32:44.220 --> 32:48.580]  especially if we get the little mushroom
[32:48.580 --> 32:51.700]  fruiting body formed in the field
[32:51.700 --> 32:55.940]  about the time that hemp is starting to flower,
[32:55.940 --> 32:57.540]  we can get infection.
[32:57.540 --> 33:01.180]  And I think one thing I wanna call your attention to here
[33:01.180 --> 33:04.580]  is the concern about your crop rotations.
[33:04.580 --> 33:08.380]  What other crops you're gonna grow in rotation with hemp.
[33:08.380 --> 33:10.500]  And you wanna be particularly cautious
[33:10.500 --> 33:13.420]  if you're in your rotation
[33:13.420 --> 33:17.060]  with a number of particularly legume crops.
[33:18.380 --> 33:22.020]  They can be vegetables, they can be things like soybean.
[33:22.020 --> 33:24.660]  Sunflower is a very susceptible crop,
[33:24.660 --> 33:28.020]  but anyhow, be cautious of what's in the crop
[33:28.020 --> 33:32.780]  preceding hemp and what diseases have built up there.
[33:33.780 --> 33:37.340]  Gray mold is probably the most universal thing
[33:37.340 --> 33:41.580]  that I can almost guarantee anybody growing hemp,
[33:41.580 --> 33:42.820]  whether it be in the field
[33:42.820 --> 33:46.180]  or in a controlled climate situation,
[33:46.180 --> 33:48.540]  you're gonna run into this gray mold,
[33:48.540 --> 33:50.820]  botrytis at the end of the season.
[33:50.820 --> 33:53.300]  And it can cause problems
[33:53.300 --> 33:57.340]  because it grows all over the buds, the flower parts,
[33:57.340 --> 33:59.620]  and in fact, other parts of the plant
[33:59.660 --> 34:04.300]  and can cause a seed quality, a bud quality issue
[34:05.340 --> 34:09.380]  in the eventual use of this crop.
[34:09.380 --> 34:12.500]  Again, it has a very wide host range.
[34:12.500 --> 34:16.780]  You're probably not going to avoid this by rotation,
[34:16.780 --> 34:19.580]  but something to be aware of generally.
[34:21.380 --> 34:23.460]  Pottery mildew, I won't say much about it
[34:23.460 --> 34:26.500]  because Chris Smart and her group have worked on this,
[34:26.500 --> 34:29.340]  but it's something you're really like,
[34:30.020 --> 34:33.620]  you're likely to see at least low levels of in the field.
[34:33.620 --> 34:36.860]  And if you're in a controlled climate,
[34:36.860 --> 34:39.300]  humid situation like a greenhouse,
[34:39.300 --> 34:41.660]  you're very likely to run into more of this.
[34:41.660 --> 34:45.540]  So I won't steal Chris's group's thunder
[34:45.540 --> 34:47.620]  and they will be talking about this.
[34:49.500 --> 34:52.260]  I think all of you know that the early part
[34:52.260 --> 34:54.860]  of the life cycle of a hemp plant,
[34:54.860 --> 34:58.540]  when you plant seed or seedlings for that matter,
[34:58.820 --> 35:03.540]  the crop is not really competitive at its early stages.
[35:03.540 --> 35:06.860]  And amongst the various things that plague it
[35:06.860 --> 35:09.220]  are the oomycete problem,
[35:09.220 --> 35:12.260]  pythium species causing pythium wilts,
[35:12.260 --> 35:15.060]  and compared to a number of other
[35:15.060 --> 35:17.060]  vegetable ornamental crops,
[35:17.060 --> 35:20.300]  hemp is particularly susceptible.
[35:20.300 --> 35:24.340]  And we see this in both field and greenhouse operations.
[35:25.500 --> 35:27.900]  And we've worked for a couple of years now
[35:28.260 --> 35:33.260]  with Alan Taylor at the Cornell Agrotech.
[35:33.420 --> 35:36.900]  And Alan's worked out a nice,
[35:36.900 --> 35:38.540]  if we can't always get out and look at this
[35:38.540 --> 35:40.300]  in the field setting,
[35:40.300 --> 35:42.540]  we've got some nice assays there
[35:42.540 --> 35:45.420]  where you take infested field soil
[35:45.420 --> 35:47.300]  and you bring it back into the lab
[35:47.300 --> 35:50.060]  and dilute that out with sand
[35:50.060 --> 35:52.060]  and use these rag doll systems
[35:52.060 --> 35:54.340]  where you germinate the seeds.
[35:54.340 --> 35:56.260]  And what we particularly see
[35:56.260 --> 35:59.380]  is in post emergent seedling death.
[35:59.380 --> 36:01.740]  And this is four, seven, 10 days
[36:02.620 --> 36:06.260]  after planting these seeds in these systems.
[36:06.260 --> 36:10.140]  And we've been looking at this with Alan
[36:10.140 --> 36:12.620]  to hopefully identify some seed treatments,
[36:12.620 --> 36:15.020]  both chemical and biological
[36:15.900 --> 36:17.860]  that can help get around this.
[36:17.860 --> 36:20.660]  Unfortunately, at this particular point,
[36:20.660 --> 36:25.420]  none of the approved available biological treatments
[36:25.420 --> 36:28.820]  are really doing a very significant job.
[36:28.820 --> 36:33.620]  Some of the chemical fungicide treatments are doing well,
[36:33.620 --> 36:37.300]  but there's next to nothing labeled for hemp.
[36:37.300 --> 36:40.300]  So that's a continuing challenge.
[36:41.620 --> 36:45.460]  And when we've looked at pathogens coming from soil
[36:45.460 --> 36:48.580]  in this assay that Alan's developed,
[36:48.580 --> 36:50.620]  it's not only Pythium,
[36:50.620 --> 36:54.900]  but there are a number of other soil borne fungal genera,
[36:54.900 --> 36:59.620]  species such as Fusarium and Rhizoctonia in particular
[36:59.620 --> 37:04.140]  can also give rise to the damping off symptoms.
[37:06.020 --> 37:10.780]  So the Fusarium fungus is very cosmopolitan.
[37:10.780 --> 37:13.660]  We find it in many soils
[37:13.660 --> 37:17.340]  and certainly we have seen instances
[37:17.380 --> 37:22.380]  where Fusarium, particularly Fusarium oxysporum types
[37:22.500 --> 37:27.500]  can infect usually through the roots or crown of the plant
[37:27.500 --> 37:29.260]  and depending on the timing,
[37:29.260 --> 37:30.700]  the growth stage of the plant,
[37:30.700 --> 37:35.660]  we can see premature death of plants,
[37:35.660 --> 37:40.660]  we can see crown and foot rots or complete vascular wilt
[37:40.740 --> 37:42.420]  that kills off the plant.
[37:43.380 --> 37:47.220]  I'll talk a little bit also about certain Fusarium fungi
[37:48.100 --> 37:50.380]  can infect through the flower parts
[37:50.380 --> 37:53.420]  and cause a flower of bud blight.
[37:53.420 --> 37:55.140]  And we're concerned about that,
[37:55.140 --> 37:57.980]  not only because of the damage it does directly,
[37:57.980 --> 38:02.620]  but the Fusarium fungi produce a number of mycotoxins
[38:02.620 --> 38:05.940]  that can be harmful to humans and animals.
[38:05.940 --> 38:10.340]  So that's an issue downstream in the products.
[38:11.540 --> 38:15.540]  So we have found several species of Fusarium
[38:15.540 --> 38:17.940]  associated with these flower blights,
[38:17.940 --> 38:20.620]  but predominant amongst them,
[38:20.620 --> 38:23.500]  we find Fusarium graminiarum,
[38:23.500 --> 38:25.940]  which I have spent the better part of my career
[38:25.940 --> 38:27.700]  working on in grain crops.
[38:27.700 --> 38:29.380]  It's the cause of,
[38:29.380 --> 38:32.300]  our principal cause of ear rot in corn
[38:32.300 --> 38:37.300]  and Fusarium head blight in things like wheat and barley.
[38:37.900 --> 38:40.100]  And there are a number of mycotoxins,
[38:40.100 --> 38:43.260]  but principally we find the toxin
[38:43.260 --> 38:45.540]  called in the vernacular vomitoxin
[38:45.540 --> 38:48.100]  because of the effect that it has on animals,
[38:48.100 --> 38:53.020]  but it's known as deoxynavalanol or shortened to DON.
[38:53.020 --> 38:55.540]  And in grain crops,
[38:55.540 --> 38:59.460]  we are concerned at levels above five part per million.
[38:59.460 --> 39:01.700]  And for human food,
[39:01.700 --> 39:04.020]  you don't want more than one part per million,
[39:04.020 --> 39:07.100]  that's milligrams per kilogram of body weight
[39:07.100 --> 39:11.180]  in a total feed for a human or an animal.
[39:11.180 --> 39:15.700]  So we have indeed found levels
[39:15.700 --> 39:20.700]  in harvested hemp grain,
[39:20.860 --> 39:23.900]  well exceeding five parts per million.
[39:23.900 --> 39:26.020]  We did some brief experiments,
[39:26.020 --> 39:28.780]  preliminary experiments where we pressed
[39:28.780 --> 39:31.180]  with a commercial oil plant.
[39:31.180 --> 39:34.580]  We had some of that grain pressed to make oil.
[39:34.580 --> 39:39.580]  And most of that resided in the press cake
[39:39.860 --> 39:41.140]  that's left behind.
[39:41.980 --> 39:43.380]  And relatively little DON went into the oil.
[39:43.380 --> 39:46.020]  So that's one piece of good news.
[39:46.020 --> 39:50.340]  Increasingly, there's interest in what the DON toxin will,
[39:50.340 --> 39:52.980]  how important that will be as a contaminant
[39:52.980 --> 39:56.820]  in the CBD product chain.
[39:56.820 --> 40:01.460]  So I don't mean anybody to read this table.
[40:01.460 --> 40:03.020]  On the left-hand side,
[40:03.020 --> 40:08.020]  there's a list of very commonly occurring Fusarium species
[40:08.540 --> 40:10.140]  that we see here in New York,
[40:10.140 --> 40:12.260]  particularly on grain crops.
[40:12.260 --> 40:15.620]  And each column across that are unique types
[40:15.620 --> 40:18.780]  of mycotoxins that are produced.
[40:18.780 --> 40:21.980]  So what I'm saying is we're keyed in at this point
[40:21.980 --> 40:25.260]  on one of those toxins, the oxynovalanol,
[40:25.260 --> 40:27.700]  but we find some of these other Fusarium species.
[40:27.700 --> 40:30.780]  So more work really needs to be done
[40:30.780 --> 40:35.780]  to see if any of these other toxins are potential issues
[40:36.300 --> 40:41.140]  in the processing of products coming from hemp.
[40:42.900 --> 40:46.180]  So in the first couple of years
[40:46.180 --> 40:48.060]  that I worked with hemp in New York state,
[40:48.060 --> 40:49.820]  we did survey work.
[40:49.820 --> 40:54.260]  I found only one or two fields with Septoria leaf spot,
[40:54.260 --> 40:56.540]  also known as yellow leaf spot.
[40:56.540 --> 41:01.020]  Now I would say that this is our most prevalent
[41:01.020 --> 41:03.540]  foliar disease in New York state.
[41:04.540 --> 41:09.540]  These spores are born in the residue of old crops of hemp.
[41:12.180 --> 41:15.020]  I cannot rule out that they might not be surviving
[41:15.020 --> 41:17.260]  on other crops, we just don't know enough.
[41:17.260 --> 41:19.900]  But this Septoria cannabis,
[41:19.900 --> 41:21.500]  you'll start to see these lesions
[41:21.500 --> 41:24.460]  on the lower part of the plant canopy
[41:24.460 --> 41:27.700]  as the season progresses with splashing rain.
[41:27.700 --> 41:31.660]  The spores are splashed increasingly upward in the canopy.
[41:31.660 --> 41:36.340]  The spots expand, they have pronounced yellowish margins
[41:36.340 --> 41:38.900]  around the brownish dead areas.
[41:38.900 --> 41:43.260]  And we have seen these now almost becoming more prominent
[41:43.260 --> 41:45.780]  each year in the last three years.
[41:45.780 --> 41:50.260]  And we saw quite a lot of this in 2022 as well.
[41:51.580 --> 41:55.300]  So I have a little video here of disease,
[41:55.300 --> 41:57.180]  kind of what it looks like in a canopy
[41:57.340 --> 42:02.340]  that these were a little movie put together by Jen Star.
[42:02.700 --> 42:05.500]  And you can get down in the canopy and see a little bit
[42:05.500 --> 42:09.540]  what the development of this Septoria leaf spot looks like.
[42:09.540 --> 42:12.460]  And again, for a lot of these things,
[42:12.460 --> 42:14.860]  you look first on the lower leaves
[42:14.860 --> 42:17.060]  and as the crop progresses,
[42:17.060 --> 42:20.100]  you'll see these things under the right environment
[42:20.100 --> 42:21.620]  move up in the canopy.
[42:24.150 --> 42:26.470]  So the first couple of years
[42:26.470 --> 42:30.030]  that we started working on hemp in New York,
[42:30.030 --> 42:35.030]  the most prevalent thing I saw was bipolaris leaf spot.
[42:35.310 --> 42:36.750]  And the folks in Kentucky
[42:36.750 --> 42:38.390]  were the first to characterize this.
[42:38.390 --> 42:41.310]  They refer it to as hemp leaf spot.
[42:41.310 --> 42:42.950]  I kind of don't prefer that
[42:42.950 --> 42:45.470]  because all of these are hemp leaf spots.
[42:45.470 --> 42:48.470]  So I like the name that with the organism
[42:48.470 --> 42:50.310]  that kind of distinguishes this,
[42:50.310 --> 42:53.910]  but they start as kind of pinpoint white spots
[42:53.910 --> 42:57.230]  on the leaves, scattered specks.
[42:57.230 --> 43:00.110]  And as they grow and develop,
[43:00.110 --> 43:02.750]  that you can see in some of those pictures there,
[43:02.750 --> 43:05.430]  they have kind of a darker edge to them
[43:05.430 --> 43:09.510]  with kind of a light tan or whitish center.
[43:09.510 --> 43:12.510]  Now, as those grow and coalesce,
[43:12.510 --> 43:14.030]  that pattern may go away
[43:14.030 --> 43:16.470]  and they can become looking a lot more
[43:16.470 --> 43:18.350]  like the Septoria, for instance.
[43:18.350 --> 43:22.430]  So that's just why these things are kind of complicated.
[43:22.430 --> 43:26.230]  And you almost need to look at your field,
[43:26.230 --> 43:28.510]  scout them progressively through the season.
[43:29.590 --> 43:30.950]  This is an interesting one
[43:30.950 --> 43:33.830]  that we need to learn a lot more about.
[43:33.830 --> 43:38.550]  It's a documented pathogen of number of monocots of grasses,
[43:38.550 --> 43:43.550]  and also of some dicots and weeds, things like velvet leaf.
[43:44.070 --> 43:46.630]  We don't precisely know the epidemiology
[43:46.630 --> 43:48.670]  in a place like New York with this yet,
[43:48.670 --> 43:53.070]  but this is probably the most frequently reported
[43:53.070 --> 43:55.710]  foliar disease across everywhere
[43:55.710 --> 43:58.710]  that hemp is grown in North America.
[44:00.190 --> 44:04.030]  So I've got a little closeup of this as well in the canopy.
[44:05.030 --> 44:09.310]  And you can see how it kind of has that kind of bleached look
[44:09.310 --> 44:12.310]  before it starts turning darker.
[44:13.310 --> 44:18.310]  Sets it apart, at least from the early stages of the Septoria.
[44:22.890 --> 44:24.970]  So a couple of years ago,
[44:24.970 --> 44:29.970]  we first discovered in some of the Cornell plots in Ithaca,
[44:30.570 --> 44:35.290]  the presence of an ooomycete pathogen, Downy mildew.
[44:35.290 --> 44:38.170]  And this is an obligate parasite.
[44:38.170 --> 44:42.810]  So it survives in green living tissue.
[44:43.650 --> 44:44.850]  What you see here,
[44:44.850 --> 44:47.930]  you really need to look at both leaf surfaces here.
[44:47.930 --> 44:50.090]  On the upper leaf surface,
[44:50.090 --> 44:52.730]  you see this kind of non-distinct,
[44:52.730 --> 44:56.210]  the distinct light green lesion,
[44:56.210 --> 45:01.210]  but you turn that over and you see these darker colorations.
[45:01.850 --> 45:05.850]  And you see the actually the sporulation
[45:05.850 --> 45:10.010]  of the causal ooomycete under humid gray conditions,
[45:10.450 --> 45:14.210]  like when you still have dew out in the morning
[45:14.210 --> 45:16.090]  is a good time to look for this.
[45:16.090 --> 45:19.930]  And we have seen this now for a couple of seasons
[45:19.930 --> 45:23.770]  under fairly in a couple of different locations,
[45:23.770 --> 45:24.890]  but at this point,
[45:24.890 --> 45:27.570]  at least not widespread across the state.
[45:29.290 --> 45:32.130]  And these are the characteristics,
[45:33.290 --> 45:37.050]  spores, the sporangia and the sporangiophores here
[45:37.810 --> 45:41.570]  that you may see under a powerful hand lens
[45:41.570 --> 45:42.850]  or under a microscope.
[45:44.370 --> 45:46.890]  And a little video of this.
[45:46.890 --> 45:50.850]  As these lesions progress, even on the upper side,
[45:50.850 --> 45:53.970]  they become more angular and much darker in color.
[45:55.730 --> 45:59.170]  As you can see, they kind of fill in those leaf panels
[45:59.170 --> 46:02.490]  and kind of a very sort of angular shape.
[46:04.730 --> 46:05.610]  Very distinctive.
[46:09.590 --> 46:13.230]  And we don't know enough about this yet,
[46:13.230 --> 46:16.430]  but I think working with Larry's program
[46:16.430 --> 46:19.670]  and Chris's program in the future,
[46:19.670 --> 46:22.870]  they'll be looking at different varieties,
[46:22.870 --> 46:24.510]  different cultivars.
[46:24.510 --> 46:26.950]  And just a quick look at this,
[46:26.950 --> 46:30.430]  we looked at three different ratings
[46:30.430 --> 46:33.430]  on the hemp essential oil cultivars.
[46:33.430 --> 46:37.510]  And you can see there's not a complete resistance,
[46:37.510 --> 46:42.070]  but there are definitely some cultivars by comparison
[46:42.070 --> 46:45.630]  that show less or slower development of downy mildew.
[46:47.630 --> 46:52.630]  So one really striking finding a couple of years ago in 2019
[46:53.870 --> 46:57.990]  in the variety, the cultivar plots located in Ithaca,
[46:57.990 --> 47:01.310]  New York, we found a foliar rust,
[47:01.310 --> 47:05.910]  which is really striking because this had not been described
[47:05.910 --> 47:08.590]  in any way in North America.
[47:08.590 --> 47:12.830]  And we found these, the yellow orangish pustules,
[47:12.830 --> 47:17.390]  the orange rust stage of this rust fungus,
[47:17.390 --> 47:21.230]  and almost exclusively on the lower leaf surface.
[47:21.230 --> 47:24.710]  So you could easily miss this going through a field.
[47:24.710 --> 47:27.590]  You might see some light yellow spots on the upper surface.
[47:27.590 --> 47:30.750]  You really need to look on the lower leaf surface.
[47:30.750 --> 47:33.550]  We have seen this now recurrence in all three
[47:33.590 --> 47:37.510]  of the last growing seasons and in a few different locations,
[47:37.510 --> 47:41.550]  but still not widely dispersed across the state.
[47:42.430 --> 47:45.390]  And this is also have been observed
[47:45.390 --> 47:49.230]  in sort of the Mid-South region in Virginia and Tennessee.
[47:51.430 --> 47:53.870]  This is what the Eurydene spores,
[47:53.870 --> 47:58.390]  those orange rust spores look like under a microscope.
[47:58.390 --> 48:03.390]  And again, these were born on the lower leaf surface.
[48:03.630 --> 48:08.630]  So the book I showed you initially referenced this
[48:08.950 --> 48:13.950]  as an issue in a few places in Northern Europe.
[48:14.510 --> 48:18.270]  And it was originally described
[48:18.270 --> 48:22.910]  by a person called Krieger, a mycologist.
[48:22.910 --> 48:26.150]  And it was identified as Eurydo,
[48:26.150 --> 48:31.150]  which is kind of a bucket taxonomically
[48:32.030 --> 48:36.430]  of related genera of rust fungi.
[48:36.430 --> 48:41.430]  It's not a finely defined genus.
[48:41.510 --> 48:45.830]  But he described this as Eurydo kriegeriana.
[48:45.830 --> 48:50.830]  And we were extremely lucky to find part of a type specimen
[48:52.110 --> 48:53.830]  in Cornell's herbarium.
[48:53.830 --> 48:58.670]  And this dates to more than 100 years ago found in Germany.
[48:58.670 --> 49:02.950]  And there's been no recent citation in the literature
[49:02.950 --> 49:06.710]  of rust as an issue, frankly, anywhere in the world,
[49:06.710 --> 49:08.070]  even in Northern Europe.
[49:08.070 --> 49:12.870]  So we tried to get DNA from the limited sample
[49:12.870 --> 49:16.730]  that we had here to try to compare sequence
[49:16.730 --> 49:17.790]  with the modern one,
[49:17.790 --> 49:22.790]  but we weren't able to get DNA out of this ancient sample,
[49:23.790 --> 49:28.030]  but we were able to compare the description of the spores
[49:28.030 --> 49:31.750]  matched up very well with our modern sample.
[49:31.750 --> 49:35.550]  And we have now deposited sequence
[49:35.550 --> 49:37.310]  for the isolate from New York.
[49:38.990 --> 49:43.350]  Over time, we have seen a lot of just a few other things
[49:43.350 --> 49:44.670]  that we see off and on,
[49:44.670 --> 49:48.150]  Cercospora, we see Stemphyllium leaf spots,
[49:48.150 --> 49:51.750]  but none of these have really become that common
[49:51.750 --> 49:52.650]  across the state.
[49:52.650 --> 49:54.870]  We may see them with one cultivar
[49:54.870 --> 49:57.130]  in one location in one year.
[49:57.610 --> 49:59.930]  And a number of other pathogens
[49:59.930 --> 50:03.010]  such as Colitopteranum species, et cetera.
[50:03.010 --> 50:08.010]  So this is kind of a continuing evolving scene.
[50:08.130 --> 50:11.210]  One thing that fascinates me very much
[50:11.210 --> 50:13.890]  is what's the life cycle of these things
[50:13.890 --> 50:15.290]  in terms of the host range.
[50:15.290 --> 50:17.410]  So for instance, we were interested,
[50:17.410 --> 50:21.390]  we saw on the same field that we saw Cercospora on the hemp,
[50:21.390 --> 50:24.490]  we saw a lot of Cercospora on lambsquarters weeds
[50:24.490 --> 50:25.330]  in the field.
[50:25.330 --> 50:27.030]  They may or may not be the same,
[50:27.930 --> 50:30.770]  but I think a lot of these kind of puzzles need to be solved.
[50:31.870 --> 50:36.050]  This is one that we have seen a couple of years ago,
[50:36.050 --> 50:41.050]  but in the very wet growing season of 2021,
[50:41.190 --> 50:44.270]  we saw a number of fields where this was far and away
[50:44.270 --> 50:46.390]  the most extensive blight.
[50:46.390 --> 50:51.390]  And this is a fungus called Crystulariella or Grosinia.
[50:51.430 --> 50:56.430]  And we found this under the very wet conditions,
[50:56.430 --> 50:59.710]  very prevalent across many varieties,
[50:59.710 --> 51:04.710]  even across CBD varieties and forage type varieties.
[51:08.170 --> 51:09.690]  And here's an interesting thing.
[51:09.690 --> 51:12.470]  This fungus has a very wide host range.
[51:12.470 --> 51:14.550]  And we noticed in the one location
[51:14.550 --> 51:16.390]  in the Southern tier in New York,
[51:16.390 --> 51:19.430]  we saw a Box Elder tree that was just loaded
[51:19.430 --> 51:21.070]  with these zone eight leaf spots.
[51:21.070 --> 51:23.790]  We collected the fungus from the Box Elder
[51:23.790 --> 51:25.590]  as well as from the hemp.
[51:25.590 --> 51:30.590]  We sequenced DNA and we got a 100% identical sequence
[51:30.670 --> 51:35.670]  to the Grosinia maricola match with both our hemp
[51:35.810 --> 51:38.790]  and our tree isolate.
[51:38.790 --> 51:40.150]  So that's fascinating.
[51:40.150 --> 51:42.270]  And again, it comes back to the question,
[51:42.270 --> 51:45.270]  what is the host range of some of these things
[51:45.270 --> 51:46.270]  that we're finding?
[51:48.210 --> 51:49.510]  I won't talk about this,
[51:49.510 --> 51:52.390]  but occasionally we see a bacterial leaf spot.
[51:52.390 --> 51:55.350]  This is one discovered in the SMART lab.
[51:56.110 --> 51:59.950]  This is a red pigmented bacterium, Serratia marcescens
[51:59.950 --> 52:02.590]  that can also be found as a blight.
[52:04.350 --> 52:08.750]  So very briefly, I think many of you know this already.
[52:08.750 --> 52:12.910]  If you go to the NYSPAD site,
[52:12.910 --> 52:16.070]  New York Department of Environmental Conservation,
[52:16.950 --> 52:20.030]  look at registered pesticides for New York.
[52:20.030 --> 52:24.030]  If you initiate a search there
[52:24.030 --> 52:29.030]  and go into the next level where you do an advanced search,
[52:29.070 --> 52:31.870]  and then down on the bottom left there,
[52:31.870 --> 52:33.990]  you click industrial hemp,
[52:34.990 --> 52:39.630]  it will show about 107 different products.
[52:39.630 --> 52:44.050]  These are by and large, least toxic chemicals,
[52:44.050 --> 52:46.030]  biological treatments,
[52:47.110 --> 52:51.110]  things that are kind of generally available
[52:51.110 --> 52:53.570]  for organic control.
[52:54.010 --> 52:56.130]  Many of them are on the OMRI list,
[52:56.970 --> 52:59.490]  but this is a source of seeing
[52:59.490 --> 53:01.490]  what things might be available.
[53:02.370 --> 53:03.250]  We don't have,
[53:03.250 --> 53:06.490]  I know that Chris is gonna talk about this
[53:06.490 --> 53:08.410]  in a few minutes here.
[53:08.410 --> 53:10.570]  We have done very limited look
[53:10.570 --> 53:14.690]  at some of these necrotrophic leaf spot pathogens
[53:14.690 --> 53:19.050]  and have not seen anything really overwhelming control
[53:19.050 --> 53:20.330]  with any of these materials.
[53:20.330 --> 53:22.570]  But some people have looked
[53:22.570 --> 53:26.690]  at some of the biological control materials
[53:26.690 --> 53:31.090]  and reported at least anecdotally some positive results.
[53:32.370 --> 53:35.250]  So what do you do in the midst of all this?
[53:35.250 --> 53:38.690]  First of all, the vast majority of these diseases
[53:38.690 --> 53:42.690]  are not directly hurting yield and quality.
[53:43.610 --> 53:46.890]  So really key in on those that develop early
[53:46.890 --> 53:48.690]  and actually are attacking either
[53:48.690 --> 53:51.530]  the flower part of the plant
[53:51.530 --> 53:55.770]  or attacking the foliage early enough to reduce yield.
[53:55.770 --> 53:58.730]  Prevention's our best tool still.
[53:58.730 --> 54:01.530]  Some of these things are seed-borne potentially
[54:01.530 --> 54:02.530]  or soil-borne.
[54:02.530 --> 54:07.530]  So paying attention to getting clean seed,
[54:07.630 --> 54:10.730]  having good soil health practices,
[54:10.730 --> 54:15.570]  spacing out your plantings to reduce humidity
[54:15.570 --> 54:17.330]  and get airflow in the canopy.
[54:18.450 --> 54:22.450]  A really good idea to remove any debris of hemp
[54:22.450 --> 54:26.130]  over previous hemp crop off of your field
[54:26.130 --> 54:29.850]  and either burn it or completely compost it.
[54:29.850 --> 54:32.250]  Weed control is important.
[54:32.250 --> 54:35.010]  I mentioned a little bit of the part we know.
[54:35.010 --> 54:38.890]  There's a lot we don't know in terms of crop rotations
[54:38.890 --> 54:41.490]  where white mold is an issue
[54:41.490 --> 54:46.490]  in some of the legume crops or other vegetable crops.
[54:46.610 --> 54:48.730]  You wanna be cautious there.
[54:48.730 --> 54:50.890]  And in terms of mycotoxins,
[54:50.890 --> 54:54.990]  the Fusarium mycotoxins on the flower parts,
[54:54.990 --> 54:58.530]  probably corn and small grains rotations
[54:58.530 --> 55:00.610]  are not a really great idea,
[55:00.610 --> 55:03.290]  which is tough because for other reasons
[55:03.290 --> 55:05.690]  they'd be excellent rotational crops.
[55:05.690 --> 55:09.130]  So there's a lot we need to know yet.
[55:09.130 --> 55:11.610]  And in addition, we talked about things
[55:11.610 --> 55:12.690]  that could be sprayed.
[55:12.690 --> 55:15.090]  I think a lot of emphasis in the future
[55:15.090 --> 55:18.050]  will be on looking at cultivars
[55:18.050 --> 55:20.390]  that are more resistant than others.
[55:22.130 --> 55:24.410]  So in terms of diagnostics,
[55:24.410 --> 55:26.810]  I'm kind of a short-termer in this business.
[55:26.810 --> 55:31.810]  I will not be entertaining diagnostic samples in my lab
[55:31.970 --> 55:34.970]  this coming growing season.
[55:35.810 --> 55:38.610]  Chris Smart may or may not be looking
[55:38.610 --> 55:39.930]  for certain type of samples,
[55:39.930 --> 55:42.770]  but I wanna make you aware
[55:42.770 --> 55:46.930]  that the Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic based in Ithaca
[55:46.930 --> 55:51.930]  is really geared up to look at hemp samples this year.
[55:53.370 --> 55:55.410]  Sandra Jensen has worked with us
[55:55.410 --> 55:57.290]  in the last two growing seasons
[55:57.290 --> 56:01.890]  to really become attuned to diagnosing hemp diseases.
[56:01.890 --> 56:05.450]  But this is through the clinic, a fee-based service.
[56:06.690 --> 56:11.690]  So just some kind of pointers on sending plants in,
[56:13.010 --> 56:17.210]  particularly foliage samples is the cardinal rule,
[56:17.210 --> 56:19.890]  don't add any water to the sample.
[56:19.890 --> 56:22.210]  Just flatten out your leaves
[56:22.210 --> 56:24.890]  and put them in dry paper towels.
[56:24.890 --> 56:27.410]  You can put them then in a Ziploc bag,
[56:27.410 --> 56:31.450]  but whatever you do, don't put moisture into that Ziploc.
[56:32.210 --> 56:33.050]  And these can maybe,
[56:33.050 --> 56:35.290]  the sooner they get to the lab, the better.
[56:35.290 --> 56:39.130]  Usually you wanna avoid shipping them over the weekend.
[56:39.130 --> 56:40.970]  And it's always a good idea to call the lab
[56:40.970 --> 56:43.010]  that you say you have something coming.
[56:44.050 --> 56:47.010]  So with that, Mary, that's my comments.
[56:47.010 --> 56:49.690]  And if we have time for a couple of questions,
[56:49.690 --> 56:52.670]  I'd love to answer them.
[56:54.370 --> 56:56.450]  Okay, we got one in chat.
[56:56.450 --> 57:00.050]  What are the best cultivars to use in New York?
[57:00.050 --> 57:01.370]  Well, we're gonna have a lot of chat,
[57:01.370 --> 57:02.410]  well, not a lot of chat,
[57:02.410 --> 57:03.970]  but there's other cultivar coming up.
[57:03.970 --> 57:07.010]  But I think maybe since it's Gary,
[57:07.010 --> 57:09.570]  are there any cultivars that you've seen
[57:09.570 --> 57:12.970]  that are particularly disease resistant?
[57:12.970 --> 57:13.810]  Not really.
[57:13.810 --> 57:16.170]  I mean, for most of these things we've been talking about,
[57:16.170 --> 57:18.410]  if you look at Septoria, look at Donnie Mildew,
[57:18.410 --> 57:20.090]  you look at several things.
[57:20.090 --> 57:23.690]  You're looking at partial resistance would be my best guess.
[57:23.690 --> 57:25.410]  You're looking at shades of gray.
[57:26.490 --> 57:28.890]  We haven't purposefully done a lot of that work
[57:28.890 --> 57:32.130]  other than we've tried to look at Larry's plots
[57:32.130 --> 57:34.570]  in Ithaca and Geneva and whatnot,
[57:34.570 --> 57:37.130]  just look for whatever mother nature provided.
[57:37.970 --> 57:40.970]  We have not done any of what I would do
[57:40.970 --> 57:42.610]  in my cereal crops, for instance,
[57:42.610 --> 57:45.610]  is actually inoculate plots and take no prisoners.
[57:48.810 --> 57:52.290]  And so we can make some very general conclusions
[57:52.290 --> 57:54.890]  at this point, but maybe one of the later speakers,
[57:55.610 --> 57:58.530]  there's no miracle cultivar at this point.
[57:59.890 --> 58:01.770]  And we just don't know enough
[58:01.770 --> 58:05.250]  to make that kind of a broad representation.
[58:05.250 --> 58:08.690]  I would say as somewhat of a generalization,
[58:08.690 --> 58:13.010]  the CBD type varieties seem to be
[58:13.010 --> 58:16.810]  quantitatively more susceptible as a class
[58:16.810 --> 58:19.610]  than the fiber or the grain types.
[58:20.690 --> 58:23.370]  And again, that's a little subjective
[58:23.370 --> 58:27.330]  because that's going out and looking at the variety trials.
[58:27.330 --> 58:30.530]  And that's not a direct comparison
[58:30.530 --> 58:32.730]  where it's been inoculated.
[58:32.730 --> 58:36.170]  The only thing I'll throw into that is because the CBD types
[58:36.170 --> 58:38.690]  are typically grown more like tomatoes,
[58:38.690 --> 58:40.650]  very far away from one another,
[58:40.650 --> 58:42.970]  instead of like the grain types were in there,
[58:42.970 --> 58:44.730]  it's like a jungle.
[58:44.730 --> 58:48.530]  I've never seen sclerotinia on CBD types,
[58:49.410 --> 58:52.010]  but in the grain and fiber types,
[58:52.010 --> 58:54.450]  it's not hard to find at all.
[58:54.450 --> 58:56.490]  That's just me, what I've seen.
[58:56.490 --> 59:00.610]  So that to me is about the environment you provide
[59:00.610 --> 59:03.290]  just based on density.
[59:03.290 --> 59:04.490]  Well, that's a good point.
[59:04.490 --> 59:08.130]  And air movement in these canopies is critical
[59:08.970 --> 59:12.930]  if you want to tamp down some of these fungal diseases.
[59:12.930 --> 59:15.170]  They love moisture and humidity.
[59:15.170 --> 59:20.170]  I have seen sclerotinia in a white mold in CBD types.
[59:22.290 --> 59:26.370]  And even in hoop houses where the soil
[59:26.370 --> 59:29.970]  that was brought in from somewhere to put in the hoop house
[59:29.970 --> 59:33.850]  had the sclerotinia in it.
[59:33.850 --> 59:37.170]  So it's not even just crop rotation in the field,
[59:37.170 --> 59:39.530]  but think about where your soil's coming from.
[59:39.530 --> 59:41.570]  What other crops it's been exposed to.
[59:42.570 --> 59:45.730]  I do have a couple of just general comments
[59:45.730 --> 59:47.690]  or one comment, two questions.
[59:47.690 --> 59:52.410]  Pythium, I can hear Chris laughing when I say it.
[59:52.410 --> 59:56.210]  This crop is shamelessly susceptible to pythium.
[59:56.210 --> 59:59.250]  So I'm going to bring back Mark's greenhouse
[59:59.250 --> 01:00:01.170]  and we've got some other stuff going on
[01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:06.170]  that like sanitation, sanitation, sanitation, sanitation.
[01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.290]  All the time, everywhere, no matter what,
[01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:12.730]  just throwing that out there.
[01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:16.050]  Other questions I have, so on the downy mildew,
[01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:19.130]  clearly that's a different genus and species
[01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.970]  which people on the call need to know
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.450]  that there's a lot of different genus and species
[01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:28.730]  that we call downy mildew across a variety of crops
[01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:29.850]  that we grow.
[01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.530]  So that's one, they're not all the same downy.
[01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:37.530]  But two, is this one, is it as quickly,
[01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:39.490]  it doesn't spread as quickly?
[01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.730]  Does it take over a plant as quickly?
[01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:45.490]  I mean, downy on things like basil and some other crops,
[01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:50.090]  I mean, in a matter of days, it absorbs the whole thing
[01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.130]  and is really hard to control.
[01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:55.690]  Even if you have a fairly decent chemical for it,
[01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:56.610]  just forget it.
[01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:00.130]  If you don't get it the first like 24 hours, it's done.
[01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:02.250]  There's no beating it back.
[01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.610]  Well, the two parts to your question,
[01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:07.210]  the first one is that we did see
[01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.210]  in a fairly under favorable environment,
[01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.650]  fairly rapid progress.
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:14.730]  It's not like in a greenhouse setting,
[01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:17.730]  but yeah, it was fairly rapid progress.
[01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:20.690]  On the other hand, I don't have a good feel for spread
[01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:22.410]  at this point because we've seen them
[01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:25.610]  in very limited geographies.
[01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:29.410]  So, there's a lot to learn there,
[01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:32.850]  but it hasn't been a distributed problem so far,
[01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:35.810]  just in a few small locations.
[01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.090]  But you know how that goes once something spreads,
[01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:39.530]  then, you know.
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:43.970]  Yeah, and we'll continue to discover new things.
[01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.370]  I like your point, Mary, about common names
[01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.050]  and even genus names.
[01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:53.050]  So, for instance, when I talked about Septoria blight,
[01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:56.210]  well, there's Septoria blight on tomatoes,
[01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:00.130]  on wheat, on other, those are all different pathogens.
[01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.890]  Okay, so just because something has a Latin name
[01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:07.010]  in the title, that also does not mean
[01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:12.010]  it's not different use of that common name
[01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:12.850]  in different crops.
[01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.690]  So, that's a great point.
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:18.130]  And yet, some of these things,
[01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.370]  just because of the way they're appearing
[01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.170]  and the patterning, I think probably have another host
[01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:29.170]  out there, whether it's a weed or a grown cultivated crop.
[01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:32.930]  So, it's gonna really take a while to ferret out
[01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:34.090]  some of that business.
[01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:40.170]  And my other question was, you mentioned the mycotoxins,
[01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:44.290]  and I assume we're talking about for seed production
[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.730]  for either human or animal consumption.
[01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.450]  That's what we're worried about.
[01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:49.570]  Yeah.
[01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:52.810]  Are there standards for Canadian hemp seeds
[01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.690]  in terms of how much of what mycotoxins,
[01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.530]  so that, because they certainly have a pretty big market
[01:02:58.890 --> 01:02:59.730]  on that.
[01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.010]  Well, for all human food products,
[01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:05.930]  it's basically one part per million.
[01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:08.130]  That's milligrams per kilogram.
[01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.450]  And that's for broad variety of commodity crops.
[01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:13.890]  So, I would think this wouldn't be any different.
[01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:18.890]  And there were at least at one point in Canada,
[01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:20.610]  if it's something that goes into baby food,
[01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:23.210]  it's even more, it's like a half a part per million.
[01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.170]  Not, I don't know if hemp.
[01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:27.250]  No, I was just curious.
[01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:28.170]  Yeah.
[01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:30.010]  Are they making most of the seed right now
[01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:30.850]  or any of this?
[01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:34.930]  We had a really critical situation with field corn
[01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.210]  in New York state this past growing season
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:40.890]  with DON and harvested corn.
[01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:44.130]  I mean, it's a really bad situation.
[01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:49.130]  And in some mills that are taking it for like ethanol,
[01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.130]  the average is coming in with three parts per million
[01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:53.890]  in corn.
[01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:56.610]  And we have, I won't name names,
[01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:00.570]  but we had one place that had 50 parts per million
[01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.370]  and shelled corn this past growing season.
[01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.090]  So, we definitely don't wanna run into anything like that
[01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:09.010]  with hemp, okay?
[01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:12.690]  Because that's the sort of thing that just could kill a crop,
[01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:13.530]  a new crop.
[01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:18.890]  So, my email is gcb3 at cornell.edu.
[01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:22.370]  I'd welcome questions if they don't occur to you right now.
[01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:25.570]  All right.
[01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.410]  So, I'm Patrick McMullen,
[01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:29.410]  one of the graduate students in Chris Smart's lab.
[01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:32.010]  And today we're all going to be discussing results
[01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:35.010]  from our 2021 disease field trials.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.620]  So, the particular disease that I work primarily on
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.980]  is fusarium vascular wilt of hemp.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.700]  And as you can see from this image here,
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:53.220]  fusarium vascular wilt causes a pretty severe collapse
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.020]  of the plant if it reaches these later stages.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.860]  And we've seen this across New York state
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.860]  in a number of different scenarios.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:04.580]  So, first I'd like to discuss some of the disease signs
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.260]  and symptoms that we most commonly witness,
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.420]  some of our current management strategies available,
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.820]  and then some results from our fungicide
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:19.620]  and growth promoting inoculation trials,
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:22.580]  and a new project that we're beginning
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:26.060]  with copper fungicide treatments.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:31.900]  So, first, fusarium vascular wilt can be caused
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.300]  by a number of different fusarium species.
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.420]  Primarily these three listed here,
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.180]  fusarium oxysprum, selenite, or proliferatum.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:44.140]  And we've seen all three of these in New York state so far,
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:49.100]  with fusarium oxysprum being the most common by far.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.860]  Here are some pictures that I've taken
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.980]  in earlier field seasons,
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.620]  where if you start over here on the right,
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.100]  there's this young transplant
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.060]  that the root system never fully developed
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.420]  outside of its initial plug,
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.340]  and the roots were bound and unable to grow enough
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.380]  to support the plant.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.020]  And then over here on the left is an image
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.020]  of an older, more mature plant
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:20.100]  that suffered a similar scenario,
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:24.660]  where these roots were not large enough,
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.140]  there was not enough root biomass
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.660]  to support the upper parts of the plant,
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.460]  and the plant wilted and collapsed.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:32.620]  And some of these characteristic symptoms
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.420]  of fusarium wilt are some reddening of the roots.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.220]  It might be a little hard to see in this image,
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.580]  but reduced root biomass
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.460]  and reddening of the roots are common.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.340]  So a little bit more about the pathogen.
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.980]  It primarily infects the root system of the plant
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.180]  through these little tiny microconidia
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.260]  that can infiltrate through the root hairs,
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.900]  and these will germinate and produce hyphae
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.020]  and mycelium within the xylem,
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.340]  the water transporting vessels of the plant,
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.140]  where a mass of hyphae will accumulate
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:12.260]  and block water flow to the upper parts of the plant.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:16.380]  And that's what leads to the wilting and plant collapse.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:23.500]  So the disease cycle that we've seen in the field
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.860]  primarily occurs where we have these asexual spores,
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.220]  like we saw in the last slide,
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.780]  that can survive in the soil for a long time,
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.460]  and then they'll germinate into the root system,
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.300]  and as it colonizes the xylem,
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.180]  like we said, it will block water flow.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.020]  And at this point, this is when you start to see
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.500]  the red or browning of the root tissue in the xylem,
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.060]  and then you'll start to see yellowing
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.700]  on the upper parts of the plant,
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:52.740]  and eventually wilting, chlorosis, and complete collapse.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.020]  And when the plant collapses,
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:55.740]  that's when these new spores
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.300]  will be released into the soil.
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.860]  These hardy chlamydospores, they're called,
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.020]  can survive in the soil for quite a long time.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.980]  So it's a difficult pathogen to eradicate once it's there.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.500]  Some of our management strategies right now
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500]  are quite limited.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.860]  We don't know of any genetic resistance,
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.780]  which we often rely on genetic resistance
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.860]  as our first line of defense.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.620]  But some good sanitation practices
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:26.180]  can help reduce disease in the field.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.060]  So it's important to remove infected planting material.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:32.140]  Gary mentioned this a bit in his presentations,
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.940]  that you have to be careful
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.380]  where you're getting your soil from.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:38.020]  Make sure you're not moving soil between fields,
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.860]  especially in diseased fields.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.940]  Ensure adequate drainage in the field,
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:47.700]  since this fungus likes a moist environment.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.100]  Avoid planting in those low wet areas of your field.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.340]  Proper rotation may help,
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.780]  but this pathogen does have quite a wide host range.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.140]  And as we've seen with most diseases in hemp,
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.460]  approved fungicides are fairly limited
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.300]  and efficacy is often unknown.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.020]  So to answer this last question,
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:12.020]  we set up a field experiment two summers ago,
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:12.860]  or last summer,
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.380]  that studied some commercially available products
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.140]  and their efficacy in controlling fusarium wilt of hemp.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:27.420]  So we tested a copper-based product from VM Agrotech,
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.380]  and then some different biological strain products.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.700]  So we had a Pseudomonas inoculant,
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.780]  Bacillus, and a Trichoderma product.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.180]  And then we inoculated the field with fusarium.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:45.100]  And unfortunately, we just had low disease pressure
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.140]  over that season.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.060]  So our inoculation method wasn't quite substantial enough
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.500]  that we could adequately evaluate these products.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.180]  So these are some areas of research
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.620]  that we're still interested in,
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.180]  and trying to evaluate what products
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.300]  can effectively control fusarium wilt.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:05.260]  This pathogen can also cause damping off,
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.420]  like we've seen with Pythium
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.580]  and some other soil-borne pathogens.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.860]  On the left here is a flat
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.660]  that was not inoculated with fusarium.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.940]  And then on the right here is one that was,
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.700]  and you can just see the significant reduction germination.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.700]  So I'm currently working on a product
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:24.620]  to see how we can prevent some of this damping off,
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.820]  and what available management strategies we have.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.780]  So I'm currently using a copper-based fungicide,
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:35.260]  a newly developing product from VM Agrotech.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.900]  And here I just plated the fungus, fusarium oxysporum,
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.220]  on our petri plates.
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:44.660]  And these have increasing concentrations
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.420]  of the copper fungicide from none,
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.020]  which is our control,
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.540]  all the way up to 200 parts per million.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.740]  And you can see as we move across the gradient,
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.660]  there's less fungal growth.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.780]  And then once we get up to 75%
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.140]  or 100% of these concentrations,
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.500]  the 200 parts per million or 150,
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.460]  there's very little growth, if any, of fusarium.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.940]  So now we're working with Alan Taylor's lab
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.340]  to determine a strategy to apply this product
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.780]  as a seed coat in hemp
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:19.300]  to see if this will increase germination rates.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:23.540]  So essentially what I've seen so far
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.140]  is that I've been studying fusarium oxysporum
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.580]  as a soil-borne pathogen,
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.260]  can survive in the soil for a long time,
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.100]  and is quite difficult to manage and eradicate.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.860]  Management strategies at this moment
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.220]  rely primarily on cultural practices,
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.380]  since we don't have good fungicides available,
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.460]  and we don't really know much about their efficacy.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.700]  So more research is needed
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.740]  on the efficacy of these fungicides,
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:52.140]  and the research for the copper fungicide
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.900]  seed treatment is ongoing.
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.660]  And now I'll hand it over to Allie
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.860]  to talk about powdery mildew.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.820]  Great, thanks, Patrick.
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.140]  So my name's Allie,
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.180]  and I'm also a PhD student in Chris's lab,
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:13.460]  and I am working on powdery mildew on hemp.
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:17.740]  So if you've ever grown just about anything,
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:18.900]  you're probably somewhat familiar
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.140]  with some kind of powdery mildew,
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.020]  but in case you're not,
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.260]  this powdery mildew is caused by Golovina mysis ambrosiae,
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:32.260]  and it's characterized by asexual spores
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.620]  on the surface of the leaf,
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:39.620]  and it's also a pathogen
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.220]  that needs living tissue to grow,
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.060]  so we can't culture it.
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.940]  We need to grow it on whole plants
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.980]  when we work with it in the lab.
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:52.980]  And so the asexual spores on the surface of the leaf,
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:57.060]  you can see here on this first picture on the left,
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.940]  and then if you were to zoom in on that leaf,
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:04.940]  you would see those Conidia in long chains,
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.420]  and like you can see in this middle photo here,
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.180]  and then on the right,
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.860]  there's a photo of what those individual spores look like,
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:16.300]  and those spores are carried in the wind
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:21.300]  and can cause new infections on healthy tissue.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.380]  So next slide, please, Patrick.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.700]  Okay, so for this project,
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:32.300]  I was looking at ways to control powdery mildew,
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.380]  particularly looking at fungicide use.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.860]  So currently there's not too many options
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:44.740]  to control diseases with fungicides on hemp.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.300]  What is labeled for hemp in New York state
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.860]  are mostly OMRI listed,
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.140]  and most of those are biologicals,
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.500]  and then more importantly, what is listed,
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.020]  there's limited publications on the efficacy
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:03.740]  of those fungicides against hemp pathogens specifically.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.300]  So thank you, Patrick.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.300]  So the goal of this project is twofold.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.940]  So first to compare some of those currently labeled products
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:15.620]  that are available to use on hemp
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:20.820]  for use to control hemp powdery mildew.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.340]  And then the second part of this project
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:25.540]  was to look at whether both powdery mildew infection
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.540]  or the fungicide treatments we were testing
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.180]  would affect cannabinoid production in hemp as well.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:37.500]  Since we know that a lot of folks are growing hemp
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.700]  for cannabinoid production,
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.940]  we thought this would be a good question to look at.
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.500]  Next, please, Patrick.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.500]  So in 2020, we did our first fungicide trial
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.300]  with some of these products,
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:58.020]  and these are the products that we used in that trial.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.940]  So we had Lifeguard and Double Nickel,
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:03.460]  which are two different bacillus treatments.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.020]  And then we had a treatment where we were alternating
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:10.460]  the Lifeguard and the Double Nickel every other week.
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:13.860]  And then we had Silmatrix, which is a potassium silicate.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:17.100]  And then lastly, we had Azoxystrobin,
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.140]  which is a conventional fungicide.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:25.140]  And the Azoxystrobin, we expected to essentially work
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.060]  against the powdery mildew,
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:30.020]  since we know Azoxystrobin works for other powdery mildews,
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:33.860]  but Azoxystrobin is not currently labeled for use on hemp.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.900]  So it's not actually something that a hemp grower could use,
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.580]  but we were using it as more of a positive control
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.700]  for this experiment.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.900]  And then we also had an untreated control plot as well.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.860]  And then we applied all of these weekly
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.700]  throughout the season,
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.500]  starting before our first inoculation.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.220]  Next slide, please.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:00.220]  So in 2020, this was how we set up our experiment.
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:05.340]  So we used the cultivar TJ-CBD,
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.420]  and we grew up our inoculum on full plants
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.100]  in a growth chamber.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.340]  And then to make up an inoculum,
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:17.420]  I washed infected leaves with a water and tween solution,
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.540]  and then sprayed that solution on plants
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.140]  using a backpack sprayer.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.540]  And then I did this three different times.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:26.220]  And then once we got disease in the field,
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.340]  I rated those plants five times, once a week,
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:33.580]  and I rated them for percent disease coverage,
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.780]  and then calculated the area
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.940]  under the disease progress curve.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:41.380]  And then I also collected inflorescence or flowers
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.100]  at the end of the season for cannabinoid analysis
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.020]  to address that second question.
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.380]  Next, please.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:53.380]  Okay, so this is our results for that first trial in 2020.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.780]  So on our X-axis here,
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:58.980]  you can see the different fungicide treatments.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.820]  So we have our untreated control,
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.180]  Lifeguard, which is the first bacillus treatment,
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.460]  Cellmatrix, which was that potassium silicate,
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:08.940]  Lifeguard alternating with Double Nickel,
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.980]  Double Nickel being the second bacillus treatment,
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.220]  Double Nickel by itself,
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.100]  and our Azoxystrobin.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.060]  On the Y-axis was the area under the disease progress curve.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.060]  And those letters on top of the bars
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.300]  indicate two keys groups.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.940]  So if the bars have the same letters,
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:32.460]  they're statistically the same to the other,
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.700]  the same letters to each other.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.540]  So you can see in this graph,
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:41.300]  the large bars indicate more disease.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.940]  So our untreated control had the most disease,
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:48.180]  and then our Azoxystrobin had the least amount
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:51.420]  and did a really good job at controlling the powdery.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.860]  But like I said before,
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.340]  the Azoxystrobin's not actually labeled for use on hemp,
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:59.340]  but it did work the way we expected.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.900]  But also the Cellmatrix,
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.860]  the Lifeguard alternating with Double Nickel,
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.900]  and then the Double Nickel,
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:08.700]  all reduced disease significantly
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.220]  compared to untreated control.
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.380]  So that was great.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.780]  So we decided to, yeah, next slide,
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.900]  to repeat this experiment in 2021
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.340]  with just a few minor changes.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:24.500]  So this past year we used a different cultivar, White CBG,
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.140]  which we had more information to know that White CBG
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:31.780]  was a more susceptible host to powdery mildew.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:35.540]  And then my inoculum was made in the same way
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.100]  as the year before.
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:40.260]  And, but this time I just inoculated one time.
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:43.540]  I rated the same way and collected flowers
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.620]  in the same way as 2020.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.540]  Next slide, please.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.580]  So here are our results from 2021.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:52.820]  Again, our treatments on the X-axis,
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.740]  AUDPC on the Y, and two keys letters.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:00.820]  And again, our untreated control had the most disease.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.500]  And our Azoxystrobin again worked quite well.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.060]  And then once again,
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.300]  we saw the Lifeguard alternating with Double Nickel,
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.300]  the Cell Matrix and the Double Nickel
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:15.340]  also significantly reduced disease severity
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.420]  compared to the untreated control.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.900]  So that second part of this project
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.740]  was looking at cannabinoid production.
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.140]  So there's lots of different cannabinoids
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.540]  that are produced by hemp.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:33.140]  And we just looked at a few to get an idea.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.820]  And we looked at a lot,
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.220]  but I'm going to just talk about a few.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.300]  We looked at,
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.580]  so today I'm going to talk about Total Potential THC,
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:45.380]  CBD, CBG, and CBC.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:49.060]  So in this experiment,
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.780]  I collected flowers from each of the treatment plots
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.220]  and looked at the levels of all those.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:59.340]  So next slide, please, Patrick.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:02.100]  So when we looked at THC,
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.620]  we saw that there was no effect
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.820]  on the Total Potential THC.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.420]  So there's two graphs here, both from 2020 and 2021.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:15.060]  The X-axis shows all of the different,
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.660]  the treatments for each year.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.660]  And then the Y-axis is showing the Total Potential THC
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.700]  for each of those treatments.
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.620]  And we didn't see any difference
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:30.460]  between any of the treatments in either year.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:33.900]  Next slide, please.
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.540]  So next, we also looked at Total Potential CBD.
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.380]  And again, very similar type of graph.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.580]  Our treatments are on the X-axis
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:46.860]  and the Total Potential CBD on the Y.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.260]  And again, there was no differences
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.220]  between the different treatments in either 2020 or 2021.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:56.420]  And once again, we saw the same thing
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:00.180]  with the Total Potential CBG.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.740]  Next, please.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:06.020]  And again, the same for the Total Potential CBC.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.340]  One more.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:13.180]  So we also looked at whether powdery mildew infection
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.300]  would affect cannabinoid levels.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.260]  So for this, I had a separate plot
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.380]  that was both un-inoculated and untreated
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.340]  with any powdery mildew.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:26.940]  And I collected flowers from plants
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:31.940]  that were from that untreated control plot.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.500]  So that's our powdery mildew.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.980]  Those were inoculated.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:38.140]  And then from that separate plot that were un-inoculated.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:43.140]  And for Total Potential THC, CBD, CBG, and CBC,
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.700]  I didn't see any significant differences
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:52.500]  in those cannabinoids between plants
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.380]  that were infected with powdery mildew
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.180]  and plants that were un-inoculated.
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:00.820]  And yeah, so to wrap up,
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.340]  some of the products that are available
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.300]  for growers to use in New York
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:07.180]  were effective at reducing powdery mildew disease pressure.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.420]  So yay, good news.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.660]  And those fungicide treatments and powdery mildew
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:16.260]  both did not affect cannabinoid production in hemp.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.340]  And that's all.
[01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:24.770]  All right, thank you, Allie.
[01:22:25.730 --> 01:22:28.850]  Gary covered a couple of diseases I was gonna highlight
[01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:32.130]  because we saw them quite a bit in the last two years.
[01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:35.370]  I'll cover a few things.
[01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:38.530]  My lab is continuing to work
[01:22:38.530 --> 01:22:41.530]  in addition to fusarium and powdery mildew
[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.410]  on hemp downy mildew.
[01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:49.610]  And we also in my lab work on cucurbit downy mildew.
[01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:56.890]  And one of the questions was how rapidly will it spread?
[01:22:57.130 --> 01:23:00.970]  And the picture that you see here is an inflorescence.
[01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:05.810]  This was from 2020 in the plots that Savannah Shellnut
[01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:08.330]  and the Bergstrom Lab were rating.
[01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:13.010]  And it actually, it didn't kill the plant.
[01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:18.010]  So if this were a cucumber and cucurbit downy mildew,
[01:23:18.450 --> 01:23:22.250]  the plant would be dead fairly quickly, maybe two weeks,
[01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:24.090]  maybe depending on the weather.
[01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:26.930]  And the plants did not die,
[01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:29.370]  but they are in no way healthy, right?
[01:23:29.370 --> 01:23:30.410]  If you look at this flower,
[01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:32.650]  it's not something you're gonna wanna harvest
[01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:34.210]  and sell right away.
[01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:39.210]  So I think as Gary said, we have a lot to learn
[01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:43.210]  about some of the diseases
[01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:45.810]  that are moving into our hemp crops.
[01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:53.210]  This particular pathogen, much like the powdery mildew,
[01:23:53.210 --> 01:23:55.730]  will spread via wind.
[01:23:55.770 --> 01:24:00.290]  We don't yet know how far,
[01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:03.610]  for closely related organisms,
[01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:05.970]  we have a better idea as to how far
[01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:08.730]  the sporangia might fly in the wind.
[01:24:08.730 --> 01:24:12.890]  And we don't yet know for downy mildew,
[01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:17.570]  but based on hop and cucurbit downy mildews,
[01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:21.290]  we can assume that it could be a mile.
[01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:24.650]  They are the spores,
[01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:27.130]  actually, if you go to the next slide, Patrick,
[01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:30.530]  the symptoms Gary showed really nicely.
[01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:32.730]  And then in the next slide,
[01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:36.610]  you can see the sporangia, they're gray.
[01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:42.010]  And so they have some protection from ultraviolet
[01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.210]  as they're flying in the air
[01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:46.450]  and they don't seem to desiccate really quickly.
[01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:51.450]  One of the things that we have seen is that,
[01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:53.170]  so on the bottom of the leaf
[01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:56.090]  in the upper left-hand corner,
[01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:57.570]  you see the underside of the leaf
[01:24:57.570 --> 01:25:00.330]  with the gray spores being formed.
[01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:02.690]  And then in the lower left-hand,
[01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:06.090]  you see the spores or sporangia.
[01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:08.770]  Well, in water, those sporangia
[01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.770]  will actually release swimming zoospores.
[01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:14.690]  And there's a picture of a zoospore in that slide.
[01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:18.970]  And it's those zoospores that will actually germinate
[01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:21.490]  and cause the infection on the leaf.
[01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:27.450]  In some downy mildews, the sporangia, the spore,
[01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:30.450]  the larger spore can directly germinate
[01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:31.970]  if there's not enough water.
[01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:36.010]  So hop downy mildew can do that,
[01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.530]  but in cucurbit downy mildew,
[01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:41.050]  you only have the production of zoospores.
[01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:42.850]  The reason that's important
[01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:45.890]  is because there are different control products
[01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:49.450]  that are effective for different types of spores
[01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:51.210]  in the pathogen.
[01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:54.250]  The other thing that unfortunately we have found
[01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:56.130]  is the overwintering spore.
[01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:57.810]  So on the right-hand side of the slide,
[01:25:57.810 --> 01:26:00.530]  you can see it says within leaf tissue,
[01:26:01.770 --> 01:26:06.090]  that thick brown circle, that's called an oospore.
[01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:07.530]  It's the overwintering spore,
[01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:10.170]  and those will survive in the soil.
[01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:14.530]  So if you plant hemp the next season,
[01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:19.530]  you are going to have that inoculum already in the soil
[01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:21.570]  as you start your season.
[01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:25.450]  And these are some of the things that we're thinking about
[01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:26.290]  and trying to figure out,
[01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:29.050]  okay, what experiments do we really wanna look for
[01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:30.970]  if we think hemp downy mildew
[01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:32.890]  is gonna show up more frequently?
[01:26:32.890 --> 01:26:33.730]  Next slide.
[01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:37.810]  So what are we working on?
[01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:42.090]  We are screening as much germplasm as we can for resistance.
[01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:46.090]  You know, for some pathogens
[01:26:46.090 --> 01:26:48.850]  against this type of Oomycete pathogen,
[01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:50.930]  you know, in tomato and potato,
[01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:54.170]  there's actually quite a bit of resistance
[01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:55.370]  that can be found.
[01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.250]  It's not always used in agriculture,
[01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:59.290]  but there are resistance genes there.
[01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:03.890]  For curbit downy mildew, there's really not as much.
[01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:05.610]  In all the screening that's been done,
[01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:07.810]  there's really not a lot of resistance available
[01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:10.690]  in the plant host germplasm.
[01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:12.650]  So we're gonna be screening a whole bunch of varieties
[01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:16.450]  and seeing where we come out for hemp downy mildew.
[01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:19.810]  We also hope to sequence the pathogen genome
[01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:20.970]  to get an idea,
[01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:23.850]  is it really more closely related to the hemp or the hop?
[01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:26.050]  Again, that might give us better clues
[01:27:26.050 --> 01:27:28.130]  into control strategies.
[01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:30.370]  And one of the reasons I really wanted to highlight this
[01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:33.890]  is we are collecting isolates to look at pathogen diversity.
[01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:35.970]  So do we all have the same thing?
[01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:38.970]  When we see it, we did get an isolate
[01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:41.010]  from Massachusetts last year.
[01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:42.250]  Unfortunately, it died.
[01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:43.810]  One of the things that's really hard
[01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:44.970]  working with this pathogen
[01:27:44.970 --> 01:27:47.650]  is that you can't grow it in culture.
[01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:49.570]  Like Patrick showed cultures of Fusarium,
[01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:51.650]  you can't grow this pathogen in culture.
[01:27:51.650 --> 01:27:54.570]  It has to be grown on living tissue.
[01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:55.930]  So that makes it a big challenge.
[01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:59.450]  So as Gary said, you know,
[01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:02.370]  we really do recommend that you send samples
[01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:03.650]  to the diagnostic lab.
[01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.290]  They're really excellent
[01:28:05.290 --> 01:28:07.010]  and have had a lot of experience now
[01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:10.650]  in diagnosing hemp diseases.
[01:28:10.650 --> 01:28:12.930]  But if you think you might have Downy mildew,
[01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:16.970]  we would love to have isolates of the pathogen.
[01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:20.050]  And I think the same is true of the Fusarium root rot.
[01:28:21.490 --> 01:28:24.730]  I know this is bad for growers,
[01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:26.250]  but as researchers,
[01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:29.530]  we are looking for the most aggressive pathogens
[01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:32.530]  so that we can include those in our tests.
[01:28:32.530 --> 01:28:36.130]  So if you do have aggressive, you know,
[01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:39.930]  plants that are dying from either root rots
[01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:41.970]  or what might be Downy mildew,
[01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:44.410]  we would love to have those samples.
[01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:47.970]  And then Patrick, you can just go to the last slide.
[01:28:49.170 --> 01:28:50.650]  The next, yep.
[01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:53.210]  I wanna make sure that we highlight
[01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:56.410]  the Department of Ag and Markets in New York State.
[01:28:56.410 --> 01:28:59.530]  They have provided all of the funding
[01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:02.570]  for the work that we have done in the lab
[01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:03.770]  that we presented today.
[01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:08.170]  And they have enabled New York to really get a jump
[01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:11.650]  on some of the hemp research compared to other states.
[01:29:11.650 --> 01:29:14.610]  And so we really wanna thank the State of New York.
[01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:17.370]  And with that, Patrick, you can stop sharing
[01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:22.370]  and we're happy to answer any questions or move on.
[01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:24.330]  We caught up some time there, Mary.
[01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:26.410]  I think two minutes.
[01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:27.250]  Yes, you did.
[01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:28.530]  Thank you.
[01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.010]  I actually have a question.
[01:29:30.010 --> 01:29:34.490]  So Patrick mentioned using double nickel
[01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:36.170]  as a fusarium control.
[01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:39.290]  Is that really like gonna work soil applied
[01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:43.850]  or is it a drench or a spray or a dip for the transplant?
[01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:44.690]  How is that gonna work?
[01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:48.290]  Yeah, we did a drench on the soil.
[01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:51.450]  And in talking to CIRTIS,
[01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:53.050]  they didn't think it would work,
[01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:53.890]  but it was one of those,
[01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:55.730]  well, if you're doing the trial, you know,
[01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:57.570]  let's give it a shot.
[01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:58.890]  I was like, what does that work on?
[01:29:58.890 --> 01:30:00.250]  Does it work on other things?
[01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:01.850]  Can we like, okay.
[01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:04.090]  Cause I had only ever heard of it as a foliar applied.
[01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:04.930]  All right.
[01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:06.130]  So it was like real research.
[01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:11.170]  That was the only question I had.
[01:30:11.170 --> 01:30:13.130]  And I will like, you know,
[01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:18.490]  I do wanna mention again that the roots on these plant
[01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:23.490]  on hemp are just so sad compared to other crops.
[01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:25.050]  I mean, they're just, you know,
[01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:27.770]  Patrick showed those pictures of, you know, fusarium
[01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:29.810]  and that the roots didn't really spread out.
[01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:33.610]  They're really, if you don't dig the hole correctly
[01:30:33.610 --> 01:30:35.250]  for the transplant,
[01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:38.490]  we even without disease, you can have a problem
[01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:41.210]  because they're just not as aggressive
[01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:44.290]  as you would expect that amount of top growth,
[01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:46.690]  like a little Christmas tree.
[01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:49.570]  You would expect the bottom to have more oomph.
[01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:50.970]  And it just doesn't.
[01:30:52.130 --> 01:30:53.450]  The other thing I'll highlight, Mary,
[01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:56.090]  is that Allie has done a really nice host range study
[01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:57.450]  with powdery mildew.
[01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:00.490]  And those results from this past summer
[01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:02.490]  will be posted up on the hemp website.
[01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.850]  Okay.
[01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:06.090]  That Jan has posted before.
[01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:06.930]  Good.
[01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:10.530]  So just to get started,
[01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:12.210]  I just wanna go into a little background
[01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:16.090]  on what a full season plant and what an auto flower plant is.
[01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:18.650]  So on the left side here, you have a full season plant,
[01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:20.290]  which is D-link sensitive.
[01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:22.770]  And on the right, you have an auto flower plant,
[01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:26.050]  which is also known as a D-link insensitive plant.
[01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:29.010]  And so our full season cultivars are triggered to flower
[01:31:29.010 --> 01:31:32.850]  when the critical night length reaches a certain threshold.
[01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:36.090]  So that means that the plant receives a signal to flower
[01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.170]  as the nights increase in length.
[01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:40.570]  And our auto flowers don't receive that signal.
[01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:43.730]  So they're flowering independently of D-link.
[01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:45.690]  And just some general notes,
[01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:48.930]  full season plants usually are larger
[01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:50.730]  and have a longer time to maturity
[01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:52.530]  at around three to four months.
[01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:54.650]  And they're usually planted at a lower density
[01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:58.970]  than auto flowers, which are relatively smaller in stature
[01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:02.090]  and have a shorter time to maturity at two to three months.
[01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:04.730]  And they're usually planted on much higher density.
[01:32:04.730 --> 01:32:06.290]  And so this short time in maturity
[01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:07.930]  can enable double cropping
[01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.210]  with another round of auto flowers,
[01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.290]  or you can come in and follow up with something
[01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:15.130]  that's gonna grow late into the season, like a brassica.
[01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:18.570]  So low density versus high density.
[01:32:18.570 --> 01:32:21.090]  So when I talk about low density plantings,
[01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:24.930]  I'm referring to a traditional horticultural style planting,
[01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:27.770]  usually spacings around four foot by six foot,
[01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:31.530]  which results in roughly 2000 plants per acre.
[01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:33.650]  And generally plants are transplanted
[01:32:33.650 --> 01:32:35.290]  in these plantings with a water wheel,
[01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:37.730]  transplanted or by hand.
[01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:39.450]  And they can be planted into bare ground
[01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:42.690]  or into horticultural plastic to control weeds.
[01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.730]  And generally these plantings are irrigated
[01:32:44.730 --> 01:32:46.370]  with drip irrigation.
[01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:47.370]  On the right side over here,
[01:32:47.370 --> 01:32:49.970]  we have a high density direct seeded planting.
[01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:51.450]  And Savannah, this is Janice.
[01:32:51.450 --> 01:32:53.010]  Your slides aren't advancing.
[01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:55.770]  You're on the full season versus auto flower side still.
[01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.210]  Thank you so much, Janice.
[01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:58.090]  I appreciate it.
[01:32:59.130 --> 01:33:01.410]  Just so you can see this picture of auto flowers
[01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:02.250]  really quickly,
[01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.490]  because I don't think you guys saw it.
[01:33:03.490 --> 01:33:05.490]  On the end of full season plants left side,
[01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:06.330]  we have our full season,
[01:33:06.330 --> 01:33:07.970]  right side we have auto flowers.
[01:33:10.530 --> 01:33:11.370]  All right.
[01:33:11.370 --> 01:33:14.490]  So just once again, low density versus high density.
[01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:15.650]  Over here on the left,
[01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:18.130]  we have our low density planting.
[01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:20.330]  On the right, high density direct seeded.
[01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:22.570]  So spacing usually around one and a half feet
[01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:24.250]  by two and a half feet.
[01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:29.250]  And we have roughly 11,600 plants per acre in this situation.
[01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:32.970]  And generally this is direct seeded with a tractor
[01:33:32.970 --> 01:33:34.410]  pushed behind seeder.
[01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:38.730]  And irrigation happens with a sprinkler or furrow irrigation.
[01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:42.170]  Okay.
[01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:44.210]  So just a little bit of background on direct seeding.
[01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:46.370]  Direct seeding enables mechanized planting,
[01:33:46.410 --> 01:33:48.450]  maintenance and harvest of large acreage,
[01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:51.690]  which enables one person to do more per acre on the farm
[01:33:51.690 --> 01:33:54.290]  as long as they have the proper equipment.
[01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:57.450]  You're able to avoid transplant shock in auto flowers.
[01:33:57.450 --> 01:33:59.090]  So our flowers are really sensitive
[01:33:59.090 --> 01:34:00.450]  to any sort of root disturbance,
[01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:03.250]  and that can cause them to be stunted.
[01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:05.250]  Additionally, you decrease use of plastic.
[01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:09.450]  You can't use plastic in this sort of situation.
[01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:12.530]  So if you're concerned about sustainability,
[01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:15.290]  you're immediately eliminating that
[01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:17.370]  in your production system.
[01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:20.170]  Some cautions, weed management is very intensive
[01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:21.810]  until canopy closure occurs.
[01:34:21.810 --> 01:34:24.330]  And within some of the auto flower cultivars,
[01:34:24.330 --> 01:34:27.210]  canopy closure will not occur at all.
[01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:29.890]  And additionally, establishment can be quite difficult
[01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:32.730]  in wet years and dry years require you to be really
[01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:35.370]  on top of your irrigation to get an even stand.
[01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:40.090]  So in 2020, in conjunction with Oregon State,
[01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:44.730]  we hosted a direct seeded field trial at Bluegrass Lane.
[01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:48.690]  And we had four full season and five auto flower cultivars.
[01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:51.610]  We planted those individuals on June 30th
[01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:55.370]  and we harvested September through August through September.
[01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:58.010]  So you can see just a list of the cultivars we used
[01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.610]  and their day length sensitivity
[01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:01.010]  is right here in this table.
[01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:06.010]  So we direct seeded our plants,
[01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:09.170]  our seeds at a quarter of an inch deep.
[01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.610]  We planted one seed every five inches
[01:35:11.610 --> 01:35:12.850]  with the Polyplanter Jr.
[01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:14.410]  which is this push behind seeder
[01:35:14.410 --> 01:35:16.250]  that you're seeing right here.
[01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:18.530]  We had 30 inches between our rows
[01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:21.370]  and we thinned our auto flowers to one plant per foot.
[01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:23.930]  And we thinned our full season plants
[01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:26.650]  to one plant for every foot and a half.
[01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:29.170]  And we did that thinning once the plants
[01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:31.890]  had roughly three sets of true leaves.
[01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:33.810]  And then you can see an unthinned row here
[01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:37.010]  and a thinned row right here down to about one,
[01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:40.770]  thin to one plant for every foot and a half here.
[01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:45.050]  So final percent emergence.
[01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:46.610]  So prior to thinning,
[01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:48.970]  we counted the number of plants in a row
[01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:51.210]  to determine the final percent emergence.
[01:35:51.210 --> 01:35:52.650]  This is the percentage of plants
[01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:55.610]  that successfully germinated and established themselves.
[01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:57.690]  And as you can see, our numbers are relatively low
[01:35:57.690 --> 01:36:00.890]  ranging from around 30 to 50%.
[01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:02.970]  So some potential causes of low numbers
[01:36:02.970 --> 01:36:04.850]  are seedling fuggle diseases,
[01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:08.970]  herbivory by insects or animals like rabbits or deer,
[01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:11.650]  birds eating seed right after planting,
[01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:14.330]  planting improperly cleaned seed
[01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:17.970]  and having an incorrect planting depth.
[01:36:17.970 --> 01:36:20.770]  So it's important to keep these losses in mind
[01:36:20.770 --> 01:36:22.250]  if you are a producer,
[01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:25.050]  because really you saw that we overseeded
[01:36:25.050 --> 01:36:26.930]  by like three times the amount of seed
[01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:28.330]  that we needed in some cases.
[01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:30.170]  So this really justifies the need
[01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:33.010]  for overseeding by a lot.
[01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:35.250]  And this is tough for some producers
[01:36:35.250 --> 01:36:36.650]  because the price of seed is so high,
[01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:39.730]  they can't really justify spending so much money on seed.
[01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:41.810]  So it's just something to keep in mind.
[01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:43.410]  It's really necessary for it
[01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:45.610]  to establish a successful stand.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.280]  Okay, so at flowering time,
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.320]  we rated plant shape to get an idea
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:55.880]  of the overall plant architecture within a cultivar.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.280]  And so just really quickly,
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.560]  plant form can be influenced by genetics and environment.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.280]  And it gives an idea of the level of segregation
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.040]  within a cultivar.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.880]  So if a cultivar is segregating heavily for form,
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.200]  perhaps it's also segregating for other traits
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.920]  like leaf color or cannabinoid chemotype, et cetera.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.480]  So additionally, some shapes are thought
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.760]  to possibly be better for a mechanized harvest.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.280]  We're not exactly sure which ones those are yet,
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.720]  but it's thought that columnar or pyramidal shapes
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.360]  feed better onto a stripper header
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.680]  than a candelabra shape.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.120]  So over here, you see our columnar plant.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.800]  It's very tall and narrow.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.440]  It has strong apical dominance and limited branching.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.840]  Our pyramidal shape has a strong central leader
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.120]  and some branching down here on the bottom.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.440]  And our candelabra has weak apical dominance
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.560]  and extreme side branching.
[01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:56.990]  So just as an example over here in this plot,
[01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:58.870]  it's highly uniform, you see that.
[01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:01.910]  For the most part, all the plants are pyramidal.
[01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:03.030]  And over here on the right,
[01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:05.310]  this plot is segregating for shape.
[01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:08.190]  We have a mix of a pure middle shape and a columnar shape.
[01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:12.990]  Okay, so overall, you can see that most cultivars
[01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:15.350]  are heavily segregating for form.
[01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:18.550]  And white and pipeline seem to be the most uniform.
[01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:22.430]  Pipeline's mostly columnar, white is mostly pyramidal.
[01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:24.870]  And autoCBG, queen, dream, and rogue
[01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:26.750]  are the least uniform cultivars.
[01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:28.590]  So just something to keep in mind
[01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:29.790]  when selecting your cultivars,
[01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:31.510]  this might give some insight
[01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:34.630]  into the overall stability of the cultivar.
[01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.910]  So after harvest, we dried our plants,
[01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:40.670]  we stripped off the floral components,
[01:38:40.670 --> 01:38:42.110]  and we took their weight.
[01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:45.470]  And so this graph is depicting total yield per acre
[01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:47.870]  for each cultivar in pounds.
[01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:49.990]  And it is corrected for planting density
[01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.630]  and seedling emergence.
[01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:55.110]  So as you can see, autoCBD is the lowest yielding
[01:38:55.110 --> 01:38:58.110]  at roughly 1,500 pounds per acre.
[01:38:58.150 --> 01:38:59.590]  And at the end of the day,
[01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:00.750]  when you come down to like,
[01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:02.430]  what is the yield for a single plant?
[01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:05.950]  It's very low, it's 1 10th of a pound per plant.
[01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:07.230]  And a white is the highest
[01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:10.070]  at roughly 3,800 pounds per acre.
[01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:12.390]  And that comes out still quite low
[01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:14.870]  to around a third of a pound per plant.
[01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:16.030]  It's important to keep in mind
[01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:17.830]  that since these plants are so close together,
[01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:20.630]  they're spending a lot of time building stem components.
[01:39:20.630 --> 01:39:22.750]  And they're only really producing floral biomass
[01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:24.710]  on the very tips where they're getting a lot of light
[01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:26.670]  nutrients into the canopy.
[01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:29.110]  So an additional note here is that autoflowers
[01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:31.750]  are generally lower yielding than full season plants.
[01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:34.670]  So yeah, just something to keep in mind.
[01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:38.670]  So direct seeding, just a quick cautionary tale.
[01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:41.070]  We attempted to recreate this trial this past year,
[01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:43.030]  but as some of you may know,
[01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:44.750]  it was an extremely wet year.
[01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:47.030]  And unfortunately this trial washed out,
[01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:49.070]  we were unable to replant.
[01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:50.790]  So if you're interested in direct seeding,
[01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:53.790]  just be wary of the fact that this could happen to you.
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:57.470]  All right, moving on into high tunnels.
[01:39:57.470 --> 01:40:01.110]  So why might someone choose to grow on a high tunnel?
[01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:02.870]  So a high tunnel enables a producer
[01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:04.830]  to extend their growing season roughly
[01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:07.550]  from May through October.
[01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:09.350]  There's a potential for yield benefit,
[01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:11.550]  which we're exploring right now.
[01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:14.390]  And there's potential for multiple cycles of hemp
[01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:16.630]  in the high tunnel per year,
[01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:18.630]  which we also explore in some data
[01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:20.150]  I'm going to show you guys right now.
[01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:22.110]  And additionally, it just allows producers
[01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:24.550]  to diversify their production within their own.
[01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:29.830]  So in 2021, we conducted a trial
[01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:32.590]  as part of a larger New York Farm Viability Institute
[01:40:32.590 --> 01:40:36.150]  funded trial to determine if double cropping
[01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:39.150]  in high tunnels is a viable strategy.
[01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:41.150]  So we planted three full season
[01:40:41.150 --> 01:40:43.550]  and three auto flower cultivars in the high tunnels.
[01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:45.230]  And we hosted a high tunnel in Geneva
[01:40:45.230 --> 01:40:46.910]  at the experiment station
[01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:48.830]  and also in Portland at Main Street Farms.
[01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:51.830]  So thank you Main Street Farms for the use of your high tunnel.
[01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:57.470]  So we decided to start our plants in rockwool,
[01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:58.950]  our compressed soil blocks
[01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:02.230]  to avoid irritating the auto flowers roots.
[01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:03.430]  Like I said earlier,
[01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:05.430]  they're very susceptible to becoming stunted
[01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:08.270]  if anything happens to their roots.
[01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:09.310]  And then we staggered,
[01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:12.150]  we planted into a staggered double row design
[01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:15.790]  and we planted our auto flowers at one plant per foot
[01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:18.750]  this way and our full season at one plant
[01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.590]  for every two feet that same way.
[01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:22.030]  And there were roughly two feet
[01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:25.470]  in between the stagger plants.
[01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:26.310]  And as you can see,
[01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:30.510]  we just laid down some landscape fabric between rows
[01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:32.510]  and then we stripped irrigation.
[01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:39.190]  So after harvest, we stripped and weighed for biomass.
[01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:41.590]  The gray boxes are results for Geneva.
[01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:45.030]  The yellow are for Portland
[01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:47.910]  and the yield was generally higher in Portland.
[01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:50.190]  Auto flower yield ranged from one ounce
[01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:52.550]  all the way to two ounces.
[01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:54.470]  And on average and full season yield
[01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:57.630]  ranged from one ounce to five ounces per plant.
[01:41:57.630 --> 01:41:59.510]  So just some takeaways here,
[01:41:59.510 --> 01:42:01.430]  it's very difficult to get the timing down
[01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:04.390]  so that the full season plants are transplanted
[01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:06.670]  well before they reach their critical nightly,
[01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:08.270]  which is their signal to flower.
[01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:12.030]  And so you have to be really on top of your scheduling
[01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:14.230]  when it comes to, you know,
[01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:15.870]  when you're going to start your transplants
[01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:17.710]  that are immediately following your auto flowers
[01:42:17.710 --> 01:42:20.950]  and be sure to get your auto flowers in early enough
[01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:22.670]  so that they're mature in time.
[01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:27.310]  And it might be useful to be sure to use a very late flower
[01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:29.470]  and cultivar in the high tunnel
[01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:33.190]  when it comes to the full season plants.
[01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:34.910]  And, you know, honestly,
[01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:37.110]  I would like to repeat this trial at some point
[01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:38.510]  with earlier planting dates
[01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:39.870]  and just knowing what I know now
[01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:42.030]  about scheduling transplants,
[01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:44.550]  I think we might get some different results.
[01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:50.150]  So we had two cultivars that were both direct seeded
[01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:51.750]  and in the high tunnel.
[01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:53.030]  And as you can see,
[01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:55.910]  generally yield was much higher in the direct seeded,
[01:42:57.870 --> 01:42:59.830]  in the direct seeded plantings.
[01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:01.950]  So this really just emphasizes the importance
[01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:04.630]  of not disturbing the auto flowers roots.
[01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:07.110]  And it suggests that it might be a good idea
[01:43:07.110 --> 01:43:11.550]  to direct seed into the high tunnel with a poly planter
[01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:14.710]  just to avoid need for transplanting in the first place.
[01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:19.270]  So moving on, this past year,
[01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:22.350]  we noticed a lot of powdery mildew in our high tunnels.
[01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:25.550]  So as Allie just went over,
[01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:27.670]  it's caused by the Ascomycete
[01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:30.430]  in the Guadalupanamide seeds family.
[01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:32.430]  And it is a persistent problem
[01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:34.590]  in low air flow, high humidity environments
[01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:36.030]  like high tunnels.
[01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:40.230]  And so in 2022, we've planned a silicone application trial
[01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:42.230]  because this has proven to,
[01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:44.190]  the soil-based applications have proven
[01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:47.710]  to be really effective in pumpkins and wheat.
[01:43:47.710 --> 01:43:50.390]  And so we want to see if this is the case for hemp
[01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:54.070]  and it might enable growers to control their powdery mildew
[01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:55.350]  without having to spray.
[01:43:57.150 --> 01:43:59.950]  And so with that, I would just really like to thank
[01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:02.070]  Janice at Cornell Cooperative Extension
[01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:03.830]  for all of her help in the high tunnel,
[01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:07.870]  Dr. Jeff Steiner for his help in procuring seeds
[01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:10.990]  for the EOH trial, the Vyons Lab for their help,
[01:44:12.150 --> 01:44:13.750]  Main Street Farms for their high tunnel,
[01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:16.470]  our seed donors over here on the right side,
[01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:18.470]  and like to thank Oregon State,
[01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:21.430]  the Farm Viability Institute, Empire State Development,
[01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:23.710]  AgriMarkets, and USDA for funding.
[01:44:23.710 --> 01:44:25.790]  So with that, I'll take any questions.
[01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:30.190]  Anybody got, oh, I see some clapping from Heather.
[01:44:30.190 --> 01:44:31.030]  Yay.
[01:44:32.110 --> 01:44:33.190]  I have a question.
[01:44:33.190 --> 01:44:38.190]  So on your weights for flour mass,
[01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:41.670]  is that wet weight or dry weight?
[01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:42.950]  That's a dry weight.
[01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:43.790]  Okay.
[01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:44.950]  Yep.
[01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:46.430]  Because that can make a big difference
[01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:48.150]  when you're talking about an ounce or two,
[01:44:48.150 --> 01:44:50.230]  that could be serious.
[01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:51.070]  Definitely.
[01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:57.910]  And something about, oh, the silicone.
[01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:01.550]  So, and Chris is still on here too.
[01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:03.710]  So you spray it on the soil
[01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:07.590]  and then the spores can't get up and get on the plant.
[01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:08.670]  How does it work?
[01:45:08.670 --> 01:45:11.710]  Yeah, the idea is that you drench the area
[01:45:11.710 --> 01:45:13.830]  or incorporate it into the soil
[01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:16.270]  and the plant uptakes it into the leaves
[01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:19.870]  and it inhibits the ability of powdery mildew
[01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:22.430]  to reproduce on the leaves.
[01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:23.270]  Cool.
[01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:24.190]  Or establish itself.
[01:45:24.190 --> 01:45:25.790]  Yep.
[01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:28.670]  Yeah, it'll be exciting to see how well that works.
[01:45:28.670 --> 01:45:31.470]  A colleague was telling us that that's what they do
[01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:33.190]  in the greenhouse,
[01:45:33.190 --> 01:45:38.110]  but they have to put more silica in for new growth.
[01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:38.950]  Right?
[01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:39.790]  Yeah, that's what he was saying.
[01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:43.270]  So I think it's a cool study that Savannah will be doing.
[01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:44.670]  Yep, we'll see how it goes.
[01:45:46.230 --> 01:45:47.430]  That sounds interesting.
[01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:48.630]  Any other questions?
[01:45:48.630 --> 01:45:52.670]  The soil matrix that we, that Allie put on was foliar applied
[01:45:52.670 --> 01:45:54.390]  so it's a different idea.
[01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:55.510]  Right, that's why I wasn't,
[01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:57.510]  cause the last slide was something else.
[01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:59.310]  And so, okay.
[01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:01.510]  Hey, hello.
[01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:02.950]  Thank you all for coming.
[01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:05.870]  I'm Dr. Karlyn Buckler, an Associate Professor of Practice
[01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:08.390]  in the School of Integrated Plant Science at Cornell.
[01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:10.870]  I lead the hemp master professional studies program
[01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:14.470]  and I'm so glad to talk to you about this unique opportunity.
[01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:17.870]  I started out as a maize geneticist over 30 years ago
[01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:21.270]  and as many of you know, hemp or cannabis
[01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:24.510]  is not corn or wheat or apples or field greens.
[01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:26.950]  Cannabis presents many unique opportunities
[01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:28.630]  as well as threats.
[01:46:28.630 --> 01:46:32.710]  And for science too, cannabis has been in front of us
[01:46:32.710 --> 01:46:35.670]  for thousands of years, but even as the green revolution
[01:46:35.670 --> 01:46:38.750]  and the advent of genetics and genomics marched on,
[01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:40.470]  we have only in the last several years
[01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:42.790]  been able to use modern plant science
[01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:45.550]  to study this plant that humans have been using
[01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:47.030]  for millennium.
[01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:49.910]  Cornell University Plant Science has been at the forefront
[01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:51.430]  of this research in hemp.
[01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:54.470]  And this program allows for a myriad of paths
[01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:56.710]  for students to understand this plant
[01:46:56.830 --> 01:46:59.750]  and what it can and cannot do,
[01:46:59.750 --> 01:47:02.830]  as well as how to be successful in the industry at large.
[01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:07.550]  So what is the hemp master's study?
[01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:09.990]  This is a one-year intensive program
[01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:12.470]  specifically designed to prepare those
[01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:15.270]  who are interested in the production, processing
[01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:18.790]  and or business of hemp to have a broad base experience
[01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:21.910]  of the industry, as well as a way to become competent
[01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:24.270]  in a specific area of the industry.
[01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:26.230]  Courses and projects cover everything
[01:47:26.710 --> 01:47:29.590]  from genetics, genomics, production, processing,
[01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:32.350]  disease and pest issues, controlled environments
[01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:34.310]  and warehouse agriculture.
[01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:36.470]  Whether you're interested in growing for flower,
[01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:40.590]  herd or best, specific aspects of the industry
[01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:42.750]  or maybe someday you wanna be your own CEO
[01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:46.350]  or COO in your own hemp business.
[01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:49.270]  Either way, we've got you covered from seed to sales.
[01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:52.630]  So let's look at some of the faculty
[01:47:52.630 --> 01:47:54.870]  who are involved in the MPS program.
[01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:59.430]  Dr. Larry Smart has been leading Cornell's hemp research
[01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:03.750]  and extension team and has initiated a long-term breeding
[01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:07.190]  and genomic program to develop new hemp cultivars
[01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:08.830]  for New York State.
[01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:10.590]  Dr. Smart also teaches courses
[01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:12.470]  on plant genetics and genomics.
[01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:17.430]  Dr. Chris Smart focuses on the management of disease
[01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:19.590]  and host pathogen interactions in hemp.
[01:48:21.230 --> 01:48:24.110]  Dr. Neil Matheson specializes in greenhouse
[01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:26.270]  and controlled environment agriculture.
[01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:31.590]  Tony D. Tomaso studies sustainable agriculture
[01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:33.550]  as well as soil and pest management.
[01:48:35.190 --> 01:48:37.390]  And Heather Grabb teaches the production
[01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:38.870]  and processing courses.
[01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:40.070]  And let's look into those.
[01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:43.270]  So those are seminal to the master's program.
[01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:49.390]  So Dr. Grabb teaches the hemp production systems
[01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:52.630]  and this course will provide students with knowledge
[01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:54.190]  of different hemp production systems
[01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:56.630]  for fiber, grain, and cannabinoids.
[01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.390]  Students will gain an understanding
[01:48:58.390 --> 01:49:00.510]  of field controlled environment,
[01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:03.310]  greenhouse and high tunnel production systems.
[01:49:03.310 --> 01:49:06.510]  Topics covered will include hemp physiology,
[01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:11.470]  agronomy, cultivation, sea science, nutrition and fertility,
[01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:14.670]  harvest methods, and post-harvest storage.
[01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:17.030]  While this course cannot provide students
[01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:18.310]  with a thorough understanding
[01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:20.790]  of all of the intricacies of hemp production,
[01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:23.710]  it is intended to provide a survey of approaches
[01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:26.470]  and techniques that are used in the production
[01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:28.830]  of hemp grain, fiber, and cannabinoids.
[01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:35.070]  And the hemp processing system, excuse me, course,
[01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:37.190]  covers the principles and best practices
[01:49:37.190 --> 01:49:40.110]  to create a diverse array of food, extracts,
[01:49:40.110 --> 01:49:42.230]  and fiber products from hemp.
[01:49:42.230 --> 01:49:44.350]  Lecturers will describe key products
[01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:46.270]  and production practices,
[01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:49.510]  highlight how hemp products compare
[01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:52.430]  to those produced from other materials.
[01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:56.670]  And discussion sections will help review scientific studies
[01:49:56.670 --> 01:49:59.630]  relevant to industrial hemp products and processing
[01:49:59.630 --> 01:50:01.830]  and provide opportunities to interact
[01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:04.190]  with key industry leaders.
[01:50:04.190 --> 01:50:08.550]  Lab sections will give participants hands-on experience
[01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:12.230]  using a broad array of analytical and processing equipment.
[01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:14.790]  Instead, students are giving flexibility
[01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:17.030]  to tailor some course components
[01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:18.790]  towards their own interests as well.
[01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:23.870]  This is a plant science overview course that I teach,
[01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:26.950]  Cannabis, Biology, Society, and Industry.
[01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:30.390]  And the MPF students take this in their first semester.
[01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:33.270]  Lecturers from Cornell and from around the US
[01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:36.630]  come to the class and talk about their path
[01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:39.350]  to where they are now and their expertise
[01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:41.430]  from propagation to product,
[01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:46.430]  but also about law, policy, business best practices,
[01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:48.910]  diversity, equity, inclusion issues,
[01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:50.750]  state and federal regulations,
[01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:53.390]  pharmacology, veterinary medicine,
[01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:56.670]  yes, that's a thing, and much, much more,
[01:50:56.670 --> 01:50:58.790]  all of which allows students to explore
[01:50:58.790 --> 01:51:01.190]  every aspect of the industry.
[01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:04.910]  And this is one of the reasons this MPS program is so good.
[01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:07.470]  Yes, the plant science here is world-class,
[01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:11.630]  but Cornell is also home to the Johnson School of Business,
[01:51:11.630 --> 01:51:14.510]  one of the best business schools in the country,
[01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:18.790]  as well as the Dyson School of Economics and Management,
[01:51:19.630 --> 01:51:21.870]  the Cornell Law School, and many others,
[01:51:21.870 --> 01:51:25.150]  where you can take classes as part of your program.
[01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:29.550]  Many of the speakers who come to talk in my class
[01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:31.790]  are not only some of the most successful people
[01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:35.910]  in the business, but are also graduates from Cornell.
[01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:43.470]  So each student in the Hemp MPS program
[01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:45.870]  does a capstone project
[01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:47.790]  for their Master's of Professional Studies
[01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:51.070]  and their goals and interests in the hemp field.
[01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:54.270]  Using your mentors and other faculty and staff,
[01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:58.070]  students will write a thesis describing the project in full.
[01:51:59.750 --> 01:52:03.630]  So here's a couple of examples of what other graduates
[01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:06.190]  from the Hemp MPS program have done.
[01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:07.670]  One student came to the program
[01:52:07.670 --> 01:52:09.270]  wanting to learn hemp farming
[01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:12.110]  so they could use their family farm in upstate New York
[01:52:12.110 --> 01:52:13.510]  for hemp production.
[01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:15.910]  But after being introduced to folks
[01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:18.070]  at Cornell Cooperative Extension,
[01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:21.030]  they decided to help with a survey CCE was doing
[01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:23.670]  to find out what kinds of resources
[01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:26.350]  farmers want to facilitate their knowledge
[01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:28.430]  and needs for farming hemp.
[01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:30.350]  The student did a wonderful job
[01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:33.430]  working with CCE on this development
[01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:36.990]  and learned much about the understanding of obstacles
[01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:39.190]  that farmers of hemp face.
[01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:41.830]  Another student looked at the misinformation
[01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:46.510]  regarding the value proposition for some farming of hemp.
[01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:48.590]  They looked at many of the standard assumptions
[01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:52.630]  of production and researched the viability
[01:52:52.630 --> 01:52:53.830]  of various outcomes,
[01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:57.070]  finding that some were not quite so viable.
[01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:59.110]  And another looked at cold tolerance
[01:52:59.110 --> 01:53:01.310]  and in specific cultivars of hemp
[01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:05.350]  that may help mitigate some ramifications of climate change.
[01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:08.710]  But the bottom line really is that the choice is yours
[01:53:08.710 --> 01:53:10.630]  in this program to delve deep
[01:53:10.630 --> 01:53:14.630]  into what you are interested in for your final project.
[01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:21.110]  So again, really happy to talk to you about this.
[01:53:21.110 --> 01:53:22.510]  Please come join us.
[01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:23.750]  If you have any questions,
[01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:26.470]  please don't hesitate to email me.
[01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:29.030]  And again, I thank you very much for your time.
[01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:33.870]  Mary, I can also chime in with,
[01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:38.870]  we will be soon this month putting out a job advertisement
[01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:42.910]  for to hire someone to put much of this content online
[01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:44.590]  as certificate programs.
[01:53:46.150 --> 01:53:49.590]  So that will be enhancing our educational program as well.
[01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:52.750]  Yeah, actually, yeah, I do.
[01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:54.710]  I have a question.
[01:53:54.710 --> 01:53:56.950]  I've been asked by people
[01:53:56.950 --> 01:54:01.950]  whether these online courses are available for everyone.
[01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:04.590]  And if so, what are the prerequisites
[01:54:04.590 --> 01:54:07.990]  and requirements for them to take these courses?
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:13.260]  My understanding is that the only course
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:16.700]  that's currently online is the hemp breeding and genetics.
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:17.700]  The other courses aren't,
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.580]  we haven't even hired the person
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:21.980]  that will be working to put them online yet.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:26.860]  So that's in the very infancy.
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:30.380]  For the hemp breeding and genetics,
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:35.100]  I actually, I don't know.
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:37.940]  They are open to everyone, but there is a charge.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:40.140]  It's not free access.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:44.780]  There's a financial charge.
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:45.980]  Yep.
[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:48.660]  How about prerequisites?
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:50.540]  To my knowledge, there are none,
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:52.460]  but again, I haven't taken any.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:57.460]  And I think, yeah, I don't know
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:58.940]  when we developed the new courses,
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.940]  if in order to do the fifth one,
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:03.140]  will you need the information
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:05.060]  in the first, second and third or not?
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:09.700]  Since we haven't built them yet, it's too early to say.
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:13.740]  Any other questions from anybody?
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:18.620]  I will just add a plugin for the growers
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:22.100]  and industry members who are in the audience today
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:25.820]  that we are always really excited about partnering
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:27.460]  with people from the industry
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:30.340]  to help students to develop their capstone projects.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:33.140]  So feel free to reach out if that's of interest.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:43.500]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.340]  on the web at cornell.edu.
