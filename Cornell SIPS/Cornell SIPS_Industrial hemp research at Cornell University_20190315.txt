[00:00.000 --> 00:04.120]  How did you get involved in the 2014 Farm Bill?
[00:04.120 --> 00:08.760]  Industrial hemp research was authorized in the 2014 Farm Bill.
[00:08.760 --> 00:15.520]  Cornell, as the land grant university in New York State, picked up very quickly to begin a pilot program.
[00:15.520 --> 00:24.320]  We started our hemp research in the middle of the 2016 growing season, but really it took off in the 2017 growing season.
[00:24.320 --> 00:31.800]  I was also asked by New York State Ag and Markets and the Governor's Office to lead an initiative to plant 1,700 acres.
[00:31.800 --> 00:40.440]  That support from the Governor's Office and the legislature and Ag and Markets has really put New York at the forefront of hemp research in the country.
[00:40.440 --> 00:47.480]  My research in particular is to evaluate existing hemp cultivars for their suitability in New York conditions,
[00:47.480 --> 00:53.640]  to be able to advise farmers as to the best cultivars for them to grow as they get started in the hemp industry,
[00:53.680 --> 01:00.720]  but also we're initiating a long-term hemp breeding program to develop cultivars that are adapted for New York conditions.
[01:00.720 --> 01:05.400]  Cornell has assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of hemp researchers.
[01:05.400 --> 01:14.160]  We're really trying to cover all of the basis of hemp research in the multidisciplinary expertise that we have in the School of Integrated Plant Science at Cornell.
[01:14.160 --> 01:22.360]  The hemp industry overall has grown by leaps and bounds across the country, and New York is one of the leaders in hemp research in the country.
