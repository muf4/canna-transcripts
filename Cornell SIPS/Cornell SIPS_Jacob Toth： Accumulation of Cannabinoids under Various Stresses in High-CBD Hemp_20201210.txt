[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.010 --> 00:09.030]  Okay, hello everyone.
[00:09.030 --> 00:09.990]  I'm Jacob Choth.
[00:09.990 --> 00:13.710]  I work in Larry Smart's lab in Cornell Agrotech
[00:13.710 --> 00:14.910]  up in Geneva.
[00:14.910 --> 00:17.430]  And today I'll be talking about accumulation of cannabinoids
[00:17.430 --> 00:20.190]  under various stresses and high CBD hemp,
[00:20.190 --> 00:22.310]  presenting some results from what we've been calling
[00:22.310 --> 00:25.590]  the 2019 hemp stress trial.
[00:26.790 --> 00:29.650]  So hemp is a cannabis sativa plant
[00:29.650 --> 00:32.950]  with less than 0.3% total THC.
[00:32.990 --> 00:35.030]  And the major market for hemp right now
[00:35.030 --> 00:37.510]  is cannabidiol or CBD,
[00:37.510 --> 00:39.510]  which is already a billion dollar market
[00:39.510 --> 00:41.990]  and is expected to grow exponentially
[00:41.990 --> 00:43.590]  over the next few years.
[00:44.510 --> 00:47.550]  CBD is isolated from hemp inflorescence
[00:47.550 --> 00:49.790]  and it reaches its highest concentration
[00:49.790 --> 00:52.490]  in mature unpollinated female brats.
[00:54.550 --> 00:57.750]  One of the things that a lot of people are concerned about
[00:57.750 --> 01:00.590]  when growing hemp for CBD production
[01:00.590 --> 01:04.510]  is the production of the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol
[01:04.510 --> 01:09.110]  or THC, which is what distinguishes hemp from marijuana.
[01:09.110 --> 01:13.830]  And there's an arbitrary threshold of 0.3%.
[01:13.830 --> 01:16.950]  So knowing what results in the higher or lower production
[01:16.950 --> 01:19.670]  of THC is gonna be very important for growers
[01:19.670 --> 01:21.630]  who wanna stay under that limit.
[01:21.630 --> 01:25.350]  And if you look at sort of what's popularized in the media,
[01:25.350 --> 01:26.710]  or at least was popular
[01:26.710 --> 01:31.710]  when these articles were written,
[01:31.910 --> 01:33.910]  it appears that hemp stress is expected
[01:33.910 --> 01:37.310]  to have a significant effect on THC.
[01:37.310 --> 01:40.590]  So if you look at the hemp and the marijuana blogs,
[01:40.590 --> 01:43.670]  for instance, here for tuna hemp
[01:43.670 --> 01:45.190]  suggests that growers need to be aware
[01:45.190 --> 01:48.270]  that plant stresses can result in THC spikes.
[01:48.270 --> 01:51.550]  RX leaf suggests that any plant stress
[01:51.550 --> 01:53.150]  can tip it over 0.3.
[01:53.350 --> 01:58.230]  Even Cooperative Extension says that the main thing
[01:58.230 --> 02:00.630]  that causes THC spikes are stressors.
[02:00.630 --> 02:03.190]  And the New York Times mentions, of course,
[02:03.190 --> 02:05.990]  the chemistry of hemp that can cause them
[02:05.990 --> 02:08.610]  to overproduce THC when stressed.
[02:09.970 --> 02:14.950]  So while a lot of people think that hemp stress
[02:14.950 --> 02:16.390]  is going to be very important,
[02:16.390 --> 02:19.590]  it made it all the way to the New York Times,
[02:19.590 --> 02:22.390]  there's very little evidence in the literature
[02:22.390 --> 02:26.110]  that links hemp stress and THC production.
[02:26.110 --> 02:28.430]  Now, part of that's because hemp has only recently
[02:28.430 --> 02:32.870]  been legalized for production in many states.
[02:32.870 --> 02:34.830]  So what we wanted to do was look explicitly
[02:34.830 --> 02:37.910]  and see if these sort of popular sources
[02:38.830 --> 02:40.730]  have any truth to them that hemp stress
[02:40.730 --> 02:43.670]  is going to result in higher THC.
[02:44.750 --> 02:47.010]  So just looking at previous work going into this,
[02:47.010 --> 02:49.150]  we didn't expect that hemp stress
[02:49.150 --> 02:54.150]  would have much effect on THC spikes.
[02:54.390 --> 02:58.270]  In 2018, we found that there was a fairly consistent
[02:58.270 --> 03:03.270]  CBD to THC ratio among genetically similar plants.
[03:07.190 --> 03:10.550]  We had a little bit of a natural experiment as well.
[03:10.550 --> 03:12.630]  We grew two replicated fields,
[03:12.630 --> 03:14.530]  one in Ithaca and one in Geneva.
[03:14.530 --> 03:17.350]  And one of our fields was severely flooded.
[03:17.550 --> 03:21.310]  And you can see here that plant is pretty stressed,
[03:21.310 --> 03:25.350]  but we didn't see any effect on the CBD to THC ratio.
[03:25.350 --> 03:28.150]  And we didn't see any THC spikes
[03:28.150 --> 03:30.330]  within genetically similar plants.
[03:30.330 --> 03:32.390]  I know this isn't a perfect experiment.
[03:32.390 --> 03:33.910]  There could have been other factors at play
[03:33.910 --> 03:36.350]  and there may have even been some selection biases,
[03:36.350 --> 03:40.570]  the plants that were really stressed here just died.
[03:40.570 --> 03:44.430]  So what we wanted to do was run a randomized
[03:44.430 --> 03:46.870]  complete block design experiment to see if stress
[03:47.390 --> 03:49.870]  affects the THC levels and if stress affects
[03:49.870 --> 03:52.870]  this CBD to THC ratio.
[03:52.870 --> 03:55.870]  So to do this, we had three cultivars in four reps
[03:55.870 --> 03:58.750]  with six total treatments, which I'll discuss in a minute.
[03:58.750 --> 04:02.470]  And we took shoot tip samples every week for four weeks.
[04:02.470 --> 04:07.190]  And then using HPLC looked at the cannabinoids
[04:07.190 --> 04:08.830]  that were produced.
[04:10.350 --> 04:11.930]  So we had six treatments.
[04:11.930 --> 04:14.270]  We had our control plants, which were grown
[04:14.590 --> 04:17.550]  best practices under black plastic.
[04:17.550 --> 04:20.150]  We had powdery mildew, which is a fungal pathogen,
[04:20.150 --> 04:22.750]  which we thought could induce a response.
[04:22.750 --> 04:25.750]  Rather surprisingly, we're not a hundred percent sure
[04:25.750 --> 04:28.590]  on the evolutionary purpose of cannabinoids.
[04:28.590 --> 04:31.470]  It's been suggested that they might be a factor
[04:31.470 --> 04:34.750]  in a pest response or pathogen response,
[04:34.750 --> 04:37.970]  or maybe even a UV response.
[04:37.970 --> 04:40.610]  So we included powdery mildew because we thought
[04:40.610 --> 04:43.370]  it might induce more cannabinoids there.
[04:44.270 --> 04:46.390]  Mechanical damage is something that people
[04:46.390 --> 04:47.630]  are concerned about.
[04:47.630 --> 04:50.350]  It may hail, there may be some wind damage
[04:50.350 --> 04:52.510]  or potential herbivory.
[04:52.510 --> 04:54.910]  So we included that as a potential stress
[04:54.910 --> 04:57.030]  and to generate that stress,
[04:57.030 --> 04:59.650]  we damaged the plants with a grass trimmer.
[04:59.650 --> 05:01.750]  We had a flooding treatment with saturated
[05:01.750 --> 05:03.310]  the soil regularly.
[05:03.310 --> 05:05.910]  And this was largely to repeat that 2018 finding
[05:05.910 --> 05:07.950]  in the controlled experiment.
[05:07.950 --> 05:09.950]  We also included two chemical treatments,
[05:09.950 --> 05:13.030]  Ethafon, which was found to increase total cannabinoids
[05:13.030 --> 05:15.030]  in a greenhouse study of marijuana
[05:15.030 --> 05:17.690]  and a herbicide at a low concentration
[05:17.690 --> 05:19.950]  to emulate herbicide drift.
[05:19.950 --> 05:21.090]  So that's what you see here.
[05:21.090 --> 05:24.750]  These plants have been sprayed with 0.5% roundup
[05:24.750 --> 05:26.950]  and they're pretty stressed.
[05:28.850 --> 05:30.590]  So this is just the control.
[05:30.590 --> 05:33.430]  This is best practices and this matches a lot
[05:33.430 --> 05:35.710]  of the other data that we've been seeing.
[05:35.710 --> 05:37.630]  The CBD increases over time
[05:37.630 --> 05:40.230]  and it's somewhat cultivar dependent.
[05:40.230 --> 05:42.710]  So it started at week zero before application
[05:43.350 --> 05:45.190]  of these stresses, all of the cultivars
[05:45.190 --> 05:48.950]  are around 3% total CBD.
[05:48.950 --> 05:50.990]  And then at the end of the experiment,
[05:50.990 --> 05:54.950]  the CBD has either leveled out in that one case
[05:54.950 --> 05:59.070]  or is around 10%, which is usually where growers
[05:59.070 --> 06:01.710]  aim to take the crop.
[06:01.710 --> 06:03.350]  So that's CBD.
[06:03.350 --> 06:08.230]  And if we look at THC, the graph is actually very similar.
[06:08.230 --> 06:10.590]  So if you look at this total potential CBD
[06:10.590 --> 06:13.230]  in this little inset and the total potential CBD
[06:13.230 --> 06:17.750]  in this larger graph, it looks very similar,
[06:17.750 --> 06:21.310]  very similar ratio of CBD to THC over time.
[06:21.310 --> 06:23.990]  What's also very noteworthy looking at this
[06:23.990 --> 06:27.550]  is that these two cultivars, the blue and the red,
[06:27.550 --> 06:31.710]  they're significantly over that 0.3% THC
[06:32.590 --> 06:34.610]  even under best practices as unstressed
[06:34.610 --> 06:36.110]  as we could get them.
[06:36.110 --> 06:40.630]  So if there's a very similar ratio of CBD to THC,
[06:40.630 --> 06:44.230]  we'd expect that even without any additional stresses
[06:44.230 --> 06:49.230]  or anything else at around seven to 8% CBD,
[06:49.430 --> 06:53.070]  we'd be getting non-compliant levels of THC.
[06:53.070 --> 06:55.070]  And under some circumstances,
[06:55.070 --> 06:57.550]  the crop might have to be completely discarded.
[06:59.990 --> 07:01.950]  So that's in the control.
[07:01.950 --> 07:03.710]  We wanted to see if there was any effect
[07:03.710 --> 07:06.750]  of any of these stresses on either the ratio
[07:06.750 --> 07:08.670]  or the total amount of cannabinoids.
[07:10.510 --> 07:15.510]  And largely there was very small effect of stress.
[07:16.430 --> 07:19.050]  So if you look at this total potential CBD,
[07:19.050 --> 07:21.510]  you can see that most of these treatments
[07:21.510 --> 07:23.830]  cluster with the control except for herbicide,
[07:23.830 --> 07:25.470]  which is generally a little lower.
[07:25.470 --> 07:28.270]  And given how stressed those plants are,
[07:28.270 --> 07:29.950]  that's not altogether surprising.
[07:29.950 --> 07:34.950]  The plants were very significantly stressed.
[07:36.710 --> 07:38.030]  They were fairly close to death.
[07:38.030 --> 07:41.670]  We had trouble finding green tissue to sample.
[07:41.670 --> 07:43.950]  If you look at the total potential THC,
[07:43.950 --> 07:45.430]  it's a very similar story.
[07:45.430 --> 07:47.870]  It looks like the ratios are about the same throughout.
[07:47.870 --> 07:49.470]  You see lower herbicide,
[07:50.270 --> 07:54.590]  and that's, we think, largely because of just sort of
[07:54.590 --> 07:57.670]  general stress, the plants are nearly dead.
[07:57.670 --> 08:01.310]  We also did not see any huge spikes in THC,
[08:01.310 --> 08:03.730]  which is sometimes what has been reported.
[08:05.630 --> 08:08.790]  But when we look just at the harvest time here
[08:08.790 --> 08:12.390]  and look at it statistically, we can see this total THC.
[08:12.390 --> 08:16.450]  The only significant difference compared to the control
[08:16.450 --> 08:20.390]  is that the herbicide has lower total THC.
[08:20.390 --> 08:25.390]  So it appears that stress does not cause THC to spike.
[08:25.590 --> 08:28.670]  What's more, if we look at this ratio of total CBD
[08:28.670 --> 08:32.930]  over total THC, this ratio remains the same
[08:32.930 --> 08:35.030]  in all comparisons at harvest.
[08:36.190 --> 08:37.470]  To explain why that happens,
[08:37.470 --> 08:38.910]  I'm gonna talk a little bit about
[08:38.910 --> 08:40.810]  the production of cannabinoids.
[08:41.890 --> 08:45.110]  So first off, the first cannabinoid that gets synthesized
[08:45.110 --> 08:49.990]  is CBGA, and the amount of CBGA that gets synthesized
[08:49.990 --> 08:54.990]  is gonna be a function of a few things like trichome density
[08:54.990 --> 08:58.150]  production of this all-autolic acid precursor,
[08:58.150 --> 09:00.510]  activity of this GOT enzyme,
[09:00.510 --> 09:02.030]  a whole bunch of things like that.
[09:02.030 --> 09:03.830]  And a lot of these things apparently
[09:03.830 --> 09:06.270]  have a strong genetic base is what we've seen.
[09:06.270 --> 09:08.330]  These stresses didn't affect them too much,
[09:08.330 --> 09:12.310]  but can be slowed down by nearly killing the plant
[09:12.310 --> 09:13.950]  with herbicide.
[09:13.950 --> 09:17.070]  So what happens in hemp with CBD synthase
[09:17.070 --> 09:19.750]  is the CBGA gets converted to CBDA,
[09:19.750 --> 09:22.590]  which can then be converted to CBD.
[09:22.590 --> 09:25.910]  And in marijuana, you have THCA synthase,
[09:25.910 --> 09:28.590]  which converts to CBGA to THCA,
[09:28.590 --> 09:31.250]  which then gets converted to THC.
[09:32.270 --> 09:34.750]  So as I pointed out a few times,
[09:34.750 --> 09:38.570]  these hemp plants, which should only have the CBD synthase,
[09:38.570 --> 09:42.790]  produce a fairly consistent ratio of CBDA to THCA.
[09:42.790 --> 09:46.310]  And as it turns out, if you isolate that CBD synthase
[09:46.310 --> 09:48.870]  or express it in a yeast system and incubate it
[09:48.870 --> 09:52.830]  with the CBGA, you get a small amount of production
[09:52.830 --> 09:54.950]  of this THC as well.
[09:54.950 --> 09:57.670]  And what's very encouraging is that the ratio
[09:57.670 --> 10:00.070]  that you see in vitro is very similar to the ratio
[10:00.070 --> 10:01.990]  that we see in vivo.
[10:01.990 --> 10:04.010]  So these hemp plants that were growing,
[10:04.010 --> 10:07.970]  that THCA is the result of promiscuous activity
[10:07.970 --> 10:10.550]  of the CBDA synthase enzyme.
[10:10.550 --> 10:13.910]  And none of these stresses apparently affect
[10:13.910 --> 10:16.750]  that promiscuous activity of the enzyme.
[10:17.590 --> 10:20.670]  So THC spikes are a real thing.
[10:20.670 --> 10:22.630]  It's just a lot of people have been attributing it
[10:22.630 --> 10:27.630]  to stress while we could not see any spikes due to stress.
[10:28.650 --> 10:32.330]  And to summarize why we think that is,
[10:32.330 --> 10:35.350]  just in a few words, is because those plants
[10:35.350 --> 10:38.990]  have active THCA synthase enzyme in them.
[10:40.350 --> 10:42.750]  So cannabinoid type can be accurately modeled
[10:42.750 --> 10:44.870]  by a single locus called the B locus.
[10:44.870 --> 10:47.430]  It comes in two major flavors, the BT,
[10:47.430 --> 10:50.710]  which has the active THCA synthase and the BD,
[10:50.710 --> 10:52.630]  which has active CBDA synthase.
[10:52.630 --> 10:56.030]  And since hemp is diploid, you can get three chemotypes
[10:56.030 --> 11:00.830]  as they're called, BTBT, which produces mainly THC,
[11:00.830 --> 11:04.350]  BTBD, which produces significant amounts of both,
[11:04.350 --> 11:07.110]  and then chemotype three, BDBD,
[11:07.110 --> 11:11.070]  which is what you would think most CBD hemp should be.
[11:11.070 --> 11:13.950]  But a lot of the commercially available cultivars
[11:13.950 --> 11:15.790]  are not solely chemotype three.
[11:15.790 --> 11:19.430]  A lot of them have significant numbers of chemotype two,
[11:19.430 --> 11:22.110]  and some even have some chemotype one.
[11:22.110 --> 11:26.790]  So here are four different cultivars that we grew.
[11:26.790 --> 11:30.630]  This first one here that's all blue is all chemotype three.
[11:30.630 --> 11:33.570]  The next one has a little bit of chemotype two,
[11:33.570 --> 11:35.770]  and this one in the bottom corner
[11:35.770 --> 11:38.950]  was in fact two thirds chemotype two.
[11:38.950 --> 11:42.870]  So unsurprisingly, it produced a lot of THC.
[11:42.870 --> 11:44.670]  Now, if you were just randomly sampling,
[11:44.670 --> 11:47.870]  you might randomly pick a plant that's blue,
[11:47.870 --> 11:51.310]  chemotype three, and then a week later,
[11:51.310 --> 11:54.150]  you pick one that's orange, chemotype two,
[11:54.150 --> 11:55.790]  and blame it on the stress,
[11:55.790 --> 11:59.750]  when in fact it was simply a genetic phenomenon.
[11:59.750 --> 12:01.550]  It was just a different chemotype
[12:01.550 --> 12:04.090]  due to a different gene at that B locus.
[12:05.950 --> 12:07.830]  So in summary, stress has the potential
[12:07.830 --> 12:09.390]  to alter cannabinoid content.
[12:09.390 --> 12:12.070]  For instance, if you nearly kill the plant with herbicide,
[12:12.070 --> 12:13.590]  cannabinoids will be lower,
[12:13.590 --> 12:16.610]  but the effect was generally fairly minor.
[12:16.610 --> 12:18.950]  Very importantly, the stress does not affect
[12:18.950 --> 12:21.610]  the CBD to THC ratio at harvest.
[12:23.030 --> 12:26.210]  And we think that the spikes that people have been reporting
[12:26.210 --> 12:29.070]  are likely due to sampling different chemotypes,
[12:29.070 --> 12:32.070]  as we're seeing that chemotypes segregation
[12:32.070 --> 12:34.470]  is very common in many cultivars.
[12:34.470 --> 12:37.270]  Another important result is that high CBD plants
[12:37.270 --> 12:41.470]  are almost certain to test above 0.3% THC
[12:41.470 --> 12:44.010]  when grown to a high CBD percentage.
[12:44.010 --> 12:46.010]  So what we've been advising growers to do
[12:46.010 --> 12:48.050]  is to ensure that they're growing seeds
[12:48.050 --> 12:51.630]  from a reputable source that ideally don't have
[12:51.630 --> 12:55.050]  any of that active THC synthase enzyme,
[12:55.050 --> 12:58.670]  and also to not get too greedy to test and harvest
[12:58.670 --> 13:02.390]  before the plants get too high of level of CBD
[13:02.390 --> 13:05.930]  so that it can remain below that threshold of THC.
[13:07.910 --> 13:09.150]  So for acknowledgments,
[13:09.150 --> 13:11.550]  I'd like to thank other members of the Larry Smart Lab,
[13:11.550 --> 13:13.750]  particularly George Stack and Craig Carlson.
[13:13.750 --> 13:16.870]  I'd like to thank Chris Smart's lab and Ali Kalla
[13:16.870 --> 13:18.990]  for their work with powdery mildew and the Rose Lab
[13:18.990 --> 13:23.830]  for working with the HPLC to determine these cannabinoids.
[13:24.670 --> 13:26.830]  This work was largely funded by New York State Department
[13:26.830 --> 13:28.870]  of Ag and Markets and Pixis International.
[13:28.870 --> 13:30.630]  And with that, if I have any time left,
[13:30.630 --> 13:32.430]  I'd be happy to take some questions.
[13:33.750 --> 13:38.350]  Great, thank you for that really thorough talk, Jacob.
[13:38.350 --> 13:40.390]  If anybody has any questions,
[13:40.390 --> 13:43.310]  they can either unmute or put them in the chat
[13:43.310 --> 13:45.630]  and make sure to fill out that feedback form.
[13:45.630 --> 13:48.170]  I put the link in the chat as well.
[13:51.070 --> 13:53.270]  Hey, Jacob, this is Travis.
[13:53.270 --> 13:54.590]  I have a question for you.
[13:56.510 --> 13:58.710]  What is the amount of heat that's needed
[13:58.710 --> 14:02.470]  to convert the precursor to CBD into CBD?
[14:03.470 --> 14:07.510]  Right, so CBDA and THCA get converted
[14:07.510 --> 14:10.630]  into the active forms of CBD and THC.
[14:10.630 --> 14:15.630]  And there's no, if you look at the decarboxylation profiles,
[14:15.630 --> 14:17.270]  they're temperature dependent.
[14:17.270 --> 14:18.870]  So we've had samples that have been left
[14:18.870 --> 14:20.470]  at room temperature for a year
[14:20.470 --> 14:23.510]  and they end up being mostly decarboxylated.
[14:23.510 --> 14:25.510]  But one of the reasons why marijuana is smoked
[14:25.510 --> 14:26.910]  is because at high temperatures
[14:26.910 --> 14:29.870]  it gets decarboxylated very quickly.
[14:30.870 --> 14:34.350]  So there's a time temperature dependence
[14:34.350 --> 14:37.390]  and they are different for different cannabinoids,
[14:37.390 --> 14:41.550]  this decarboxylation, and that's an area of active research.
[14:42.830 --> 14:43.750]  Okay, thanks.
[14:46.690 --> 14:48.890]  I think there's one more question in the chat
[14:48.890 --> 14:50.690]  before we move on.
[14:50.690 --> 14:54.570]  Faith asks, have you considered including mechanical stress
[14:54.570 --> 14:55.850]  for another experiment?
[14:56.850 --> 15:01.850]  So we were hoping that our mechanical damaging the plant
[15:02.330 --> 15:07.330]  would sort of encompass any sort of major mechanical stress.
[15:10.090 --> 15:13.090]  It might be something different
[15:13.090 --> 15:17.930]  given that we saw very clear no results.
[15:17.930 --> 15:20.050]  I don't think we have immediate plans
[15:20.050 --> 15:23.570]  to repeat work like this.
[15:24.010 --> 15:26.850]  We have a nice theory that it's just that one enzyme
[15:26.850 --> 15:31.570]  and we don't foresee it being affected by mechanical stress
[15:31.570 --> 15:35.050]  and we didn't see an effect of our physical damage.
[15:35.050 --> 15:37.170]  So it would be another stress
[15:37.170 --> 15:38.890]  that could potentially be included,
[15:38.890 --> 15:42.050]  but we don't really have any immediate plans to test that.
[15:44.490 --> 15:47.290]  Awesome, thank you again, Jacob.
[15:47.290 --> 15:51.010]  We can all give him the clap emojis.
[15:51.370 --> 15:54.130]  And I think Ana is gonna introduce our next speaker.
[16:00.060 --> 16:03.540]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[16:03.540 --> 16:06.380]  on the web at cornell.edu.
