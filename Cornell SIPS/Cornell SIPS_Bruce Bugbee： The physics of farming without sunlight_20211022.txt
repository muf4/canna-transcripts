[00:00.000 --> 00:07.320]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.320 --> 00:09.120]  Thank you, May.
[00:09.120 --> 00:10.560]  The first thing I want to tell you
[00:10.560 --> 00:14.560]  is it's very edifying to come to Cornell.
[00:14.560 --> 00:16.400]  And if you're a young student, you
[00:16.400 --> 00:19.040]  can look up the word edifying.
[00:19.040 --> 00:21.480]  But it means spiritually enlightening.
[00:21.480 --> 00:24.040]  And I'd like, that's one of my favorite words,
[00:24.040 --> 00:26.560]  lots of things in life are edifying,
[00:26.560 --> 00:29.240]  including coming here.
[00:29.240 --> 00:31.720]  Right out of the gate, I want to tell you
[00:31.720 --> 00:36.240]  this is unique because I'm honored that Bob Langhans is
[00:36.240 --> 00:38.680]  with us.
[00:38.680 --> 00:42.560]  He's come from way out of retirement to be here.
[00:42.560 --> 00:45.960]  Bob was real influential in my early career.
[00:45.960 --> 00:48.680]  I was never a student here, but he would
[00:48.680 --> 00:50.800]  comment on the talks I gave.
[00:50.800 --> 00:55.520]  And he inspired me to attempt great things.
[00:55.520 --> 00:57.080]  So Bob, I appreciate that.
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.600]  This was 40 years ago now that we're doing that.
[01:02.600 --> 01:04.480]  And it says something about a department
[01:04.480 --> 01:07.720]  when you have emeritus faculty that are still
[01:07.720 --> 01:09.640]  part of the department.
[01:09.640 --> 01:15.600]  That kind of enterprise is bigger than any one person.
[01:15.600 --> 01:18.960]  So of the many things I might have talked about,
[01:18.960 --> 01:23.160]  I chose to talk about this title right here.
[01:23.160 --> 01:30.120]  And this is mainly because this is poorly understood.
[01:30.120 --> 01:35.640]  And I want to help shed a little light on this subject.
[01:35.640 --> 01:37.880]  I'm also inspired to talk about this
[01:37.880 --> 01:41.040]  because another influential person in my life
[01:41.040 --> 01:42.320]  was Lou Albrecht.
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.000]  And many years ago, he and I would compare notes.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  I was funded by NASA, which is growing plants,
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.840]  indoor agriculture on Mars.
[01:50.880 --> 01:53.720]  And what's the cost effectiveness of that?
[01:53.720 --> 01:56.120]  And Lou was doing it here on Earth.
[01:56.120 --> 02:02.000]  And he was another influential person in my early career.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.720]  So I understand that this is the graduate student seminar.
[02:08.720 --> 02:10.240]  So I'm going to take the opportunity
[02:10.240 --> 02:13.280]  to do a little more philosophy than I might have.
[02:13.280 --> 02:18.240]  And my very first picture is of an artist.
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.440]  This is Henri Matisse, a French artist.
[02:22.440 --> 02:26.600]  And he is famous for this quote right here.
[02:26.600 --> 02:28.120]  I don't paint things.
[02:28.120 --> 02:31.480]  I paint the difference between things.
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.480]  And it was a number of years ago I read this.
[02:33.480 --> 02:35.400]  But it just hit me hard.
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.040]  In science, we're always trying to do absolutes.
[02:39.040 --> 02:40.920]  And absolutes are very hard to do.
[02:40.920 --> 02:42.600]  So we do relatives.
[02:42.600 --> 02:46.720]  And much of what we do says, this is bigger than that.
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.880]  Now, I'm going to tell you it's 12% bigger.
[02:48.880 --> 02:50.480]  But I'm not sure about the 12%.
[02:50.480 --> 02:52.040]  It's just bigger.
[02:52.040 --> 02:54.560]  And it helped me get a perspective
[02:54.560 --> 02:57.560]  on what we can do in research and what we can't do.
[02:57.560 --> 03:01.240]  And much of what I'm going to show you is relative.
[03:01.240 --> 03:02.520]  This is bigger than this.
[03:02.520 --> 03:04.360]  This is a difference between things.
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.640]  And we do the best we can to get absolutes.
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.400]  But that was a influential quote in my life.
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.080]  Now, here's wheat and the field.
[03:19.680 --> 03:23.320]  I have been an active member of the Agronomy Society
[03:23.320 --> 03:25.680]  for my whole career.
[03:25.680 --> 03:27.920]  And in fact, I've gone to more agronomy meetings
[03:27.920 --> 03:29.960]  than I have at horticulture meetings.
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.320]  And look at how people focus on agronomic crops, corn,
[03:34.320 --> 03:37.360]  soybeans, wheat, just exceptionally well studied.
[03:37.360 --> 03:41.320]  Hundreds of people studying this.
[03:41.320 --> 03:46.320]  So we can take the models that we've used for wheat,
[03:46.320 --> 03:47.400]  the many models.
[03:47.400 --> 03:51.280]  And wheat, by the way, is what we've been funded by NASA,
[03:51.280 --> 03:53.040]  early in my career, funded by NASA
[03:53.040 --> 03:55.520]  to study wheat in controlled environments,
[03:55.520 --> 03:59.760]  and apply those to now on Earth controlled environments
[03:59.760 --> 04:01.160]  and wheat without sunlight.
[04:01.160 --> 04:04.240]  So I want to acknowledge two funding sources.
[04:04.240 --> 04:08.400]  I've been funded by NASA pretty much continuously
[04:08.400 --> 04:10.200]  through a 40-year career.
[04:10.200 --> 04:12.480]  And it's really been helpful.
[04:12.480 --> 04:15.040]  And it's competitive proposals.
[04:15.040 --> 04:16.480]  But I know what their needs are.
[04:16.480 --> 04:18.360]  And I'm able to write proposals that
[04:18.360 --> 04:20.320]  have kept us getting funded.
[04:20.320 --> 04:22.880]  It's been a remarkable thing for me.
[04:22.880 --> 04:26.400]  And now in recent years, we've been funded by USDA.
[04:26.400 --> 04:30.760]  And Neil here, Madsen, is also funded by this same group.
[04:30.760 --> 04:33.280]  We call this the Lamp Project, Lighting Approaches
[04:33.280 --> 04:35.320]  to Maximize Profits.
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.480]  So this doesn't say indoor ag.
[04:37.520 --> 04:40.560]  It just says electric lighting.
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.920]  So with this background, I want to go from the field
[04:44.920 --> 04:48.240]  to indoors and look what we can do.
[04:48.240 --> 04:51.880]  Now, Henri Matisse painted pictures.
[04:51.880 --> 04:53.360]  He didn't put text.
[04:53.360 --> 04:54.680]  He didn't put equations.
[04:54.680 --> 04:57.160]  He painted pictures.
[04:57.160 --> 04:59.440]  And the more I do this, the less I
[04:59.440 --> 05:03.960]  try to use less words and less equations and more pictures.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.960]  And the pictures can be, and the graphics can be memorable.
[05:08.960 --> 05:11.160]  And if there's one thing I think I'm finally
[05:11.160 --> 05:14.040]  starting to get good at in this point in my career
[05:14.040 --> 05:17.400]  is more graphics because they're memorable.
[05:17.400 --> 05:21.040]  I know it is because I've seen my own students take graphics
[05:21.040 --> 05:25.600]  I made and give talks 20 years later using the same images.
[05:25.600 --> 05:27.600]  If I were to put words and pictures up,
[05:27.600 --> 05:29.200]  they wouldn't remember them.
[05:29.200 --> 05:32.880]  So I'm going to try and show you the physics of farming
[05:32.880 --> 05:37.640]  without sunlight in graphics.
[05:37.640 --> 05:41.360]  We're going to start with 100 years ago, agriculture.
[05:41.360 --> 05:43.320]  Pretty simple.
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.200]  We used a lot of animal agriculture, a small plot.
[05:48.200 --> 05:52.000]  The rain came in, and we got some yield.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.160]  Now, we vilify animal agriculture now
[05:55.160 --> 06:00.120]  because of the way it's done in developed countries, feedlots.
[06:00.120 --> 06:01.640]  That is real inefficient.
[06:01.680 --> 06:04.200]  We try to get people to change their diet.
[06:04.200 --> 06:06.880]  That's part of what my TED Talk is about.
[06:06.880 --> 06:12.760]  The TED Talk is called turning water into food.
[06:12.760 --> 06:15.960]  But it's an appeal to people to change their diets
[06:15.960 --> 06:18.360]  to save the planet.
[06:18.360 --> 06:21.480]  But when third world countries do animal agriculture,
[06:21.480 --> 06:22.760]  it's really efficient.
[06:22.760 --> 06:25.480]  They feed the scraps that the animals eat on land
[06:25.480 --> 06:27.160]  that can't be used by people.
[06:27.160 --> 06:29.200]  Animal agriculture is not bad.
[06:29.240 --> 06:31.720]  It's just the way it's practiced in the United States
[06:31.720 --> 06:34.320]  that causes problems.
[06:34.320 --> 06:37.600]  So there it is, small yield, rain fed.
[06:37.600 --> 06:40.840]  Now, we fast forward to today.
[06:40.840 --> 06:45.960]  The same single farmer grows a much bigger plot of ground.
[06:45.960 --> 06:47.600]  The yield is much higher.
[06:47.600 --> 06:49.760]  And by the way, all these arrows and these things
[06:49.760 --> 06:52.680]  are scaled to inputs and outputs.
[06:52.680 --> 06:55.920]  The size of the arrow is the size of the inputs.
[06:55.920 --> 07:00.840]  But now we rely way more on groundwater and fossil fuels
[07:00.840 --> 07:03.000]  than we ever did.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.280]  And 30 years ago, we were being criticized
[07:06.280 --> 07:08.880]  for fossil fuel agriculture.
[07:08.880 --> 07:11.240]  But fossil fuels are cheap.
[07:11.240 --> 07:15.320]  That same grower grows a big expanse of ground.
[07:15.320 --> 07:20.720]  Especially in a place like Utah, we rely heavily on irrigation.
[07:20.720 --> 07:22.720]  We use a lot of groundwater.
[07:22.720 --> 07:25.360]  Lots of evidence we're going to run out of water
[07:25.360 --> 07:27.480]  before we run out of fossil fuels.
[07:27.480 --> 07:31.280]  In fact, compelling evidence we're
[07:31.280 --> 07:34.720]  going to run out of water for agriculture.
[07:34.720 --> 07:36.080]  So there it is today.
[07:36.080 --> 07:40.720]  Yield is bigger, same person.
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.960]  Now, if I told you the arrows are
[07:43.960 --> 07:49.640]  scaled to inputs and outputs, the pixels in this green arrow
[07:49.640 --> 07:53.360]  are bigger than the pixels in that black arrow.
[07:53.400 --> 07:57.720]  The first law of thermodynamics says energy in
[07:57.720 --> 08:01.000]  equals energy out.
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.360]  How can this be?
[08:02.360 --> 08:05.400]  If we have this much energy in, how can we
[08:05.400 --> 08:07.320]  get that much energy out?
[08:07.320 --> 08:11.440]  Doesn't this violate the first law of thermodynamics?
[08:11.440 --> 08:16.800]  No, because we forget about the elephant in the room.
[08:16.800 --> 08:18.080]  Boom.
[08:18.080 --> 08:22.640]  60 moles a day of solar radiation coming into this.
[08:22.680 --> 08:25.320]  This is a bright, sunny day.
[08:25.320 --> 08:30.160]  And you know how crop production is maybe 2% or 3% efficient?
[08:30.160 --> 08:33.600]  Well, that's 3% of that.
[08:33.600 --> 08:36.880]  This becomes insignificant when we
[08:36.880 --> 08:41.360]  think about the massive input of solar energy.
[08:41.360 --> 08:44.800]  So we know what the efficiency of LEDs are.
[08:44.800 --> 08:45.920]  They're astounding.
[08:45.920 --> 08:49.600]  And we've got a bunch of papers on where they are,
[08:49.600 --> 08:51.600]  where they're going to get to.
[08:51.600 --> 08:57.240]  What if we wanted to give a field electric photons
[08:57.240 --> 08:58.880]  from LEDs?
[08:58.880 --> 09:00.760]  And we paid the electric bill.
[09:00.760 --> 09:05.320]  What would that cost to do that?
[09:05.320 --> 09:08.800]  It's a half a million dollars per hectare
[09:08.800 --> 09:11.840]  per 100-day growing season.
[09:11.840 --> 09:14.720]  And you think about the value of agricultural land,
[09:14.720 --> 09:17.280]  and you realize people are buying sunlight.
[09:17.280 --> 09:21.440]  They're buying a surface area with free photon input
[09:21.840 --> 09:25.680]  that largely determines the value of our agricultural land
[09:25.680 --> 09:28.600]  because the sun comes up for free.
[09:28.600 --> 09:32.680]  But this is $0.50 per meter squared per day.
[09:32.680 --> 09:35.120]  And you think about a half a million dollars
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.920]  per hectare, big, big inputs that
[09:38.920 --> 09:42.680]  would be very expensive to replace with electric lights.
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.680]  Now, this is full sunlight to get this.
[09:46.680 --> 09:50.200]  So if we take that out of there.
[09:50.600 --> 09:52.800]  Now, I put this little sidebar in.
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.720]  I told you I wasn't going to show equations,
[09:54.720 --> 09:57.360]  but this is arithmetic.
[09:57.360 --> 09:59.320]  And I want to show you how we get this
[09:59.320 --> 10:04.080]  because it's really pretty easy to calculate that number.
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.080]  This number right here is what we call the efficacy
[10:08.080 --> 10:10.280]  of electric lights.
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.280]  Now, efficiency would be watts out and watts in.
[10:14.280 --> 10:16.800]  But photosynthesis is not driven by energy.
[10:16.800 --> 10:18.800]  It's driven by photons.
[10:18.840 --> 10:20.960]  So the numerator has to be photons,
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.040]  and the input then comes out to be joules of electric energy.
[10:25.040 --> 10:27.920]  And people that are in this business know this number.
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.200]  And high-pressure sodium lights, which
[10:31.200 --> 10:34.560]  were the gold standard in the recent past,
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.320]  are 1.7 micromoles per joule.
[10:38.320 --> 10:40.840]  And that's even with some advances.
[10:40.840 --> 10:42.640]  This number is double that.
[10:42.640 --> 10:45.840]  So it's just an astounding increase
[10:45.840 --> 10:48.400]  in the efficiency of lighting.
[10:48.400 --> 10:53.400]  We're up to close to 70%, 80% efficient of LEDs now.
[10:53.400 --> 10:55.480]  I mean, it's incredible.
[10:55.480 --> 10:57.680]  There's the efficiency.
[10:57.680 --> 11:00.400]  This is $0.10 a kilowatt hour.
[11:00.400 --> 11:02.880]  It's a standard price.
[11:02.880 --> 11:05.280]  A kilowatt hour is a really bizarre unit.
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.400]  There's watts is power, joules is energy.
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.800]  A kilowatt is a kilojoule per second, hours is time.
[11:14.800 --> 11:17.480]  A kilowatt hour is 3.6 megajoules
[11:17.520 --> 11:19.680]  when you do the math.
[11:19.680 --> 11:24.440]  So we can buy 3.6 megajoules of energy for $0.10.
[11:24.440 --> 11:27.240]  Now, the beauty of this is this is 10 to the minus 6,
[11:27.240 --> 11:28.920]  and that's 10 to the plus 6.
[11:28.920 --> 11:32.040]  And that cancels, and you've got to multiply 3 by 3,
[11:32.040 --> 11:37.800]  divide by 10, 120 moles of photons for $1.
[11:37.800 --> 11:41.360]  Now, this is very state-of-the-art LEDs,
[11:41.360 --> 11:45.600]  but that's an amazing number to remember.
[11:45.600 --> 11:49.480]  Not so long ago, this was 100 moles per dollar.
[11:49.480 --> 11:52.720]  And in fact, this is a bit futuristic.
[11:52.720 --> 11:54.720]  We're not here yet.
[11:54.720 --> 11:59.040]  But that means a mole of photon costs a penny.
[11:59.040 --> 12:01.800]  I should write that down on the board somewhere.
[12:01.800 --> 12:04.720]  A penny per mole of photons.
[12:04.720 --> 12:07.520]  Wow, does that simplify the economics.
[12:07.520 --> 12:10.440]  You need 30 moles a day per meter squared
[12:10.440 --> 12:12.000]  per day for your crop.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.600]  That's $0.30 a day.
[12:13.920 --> 12:16.000]  When you run that number, you can do a lot of math
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.760]  in your head.
[12:17.760 --> 12:19.600]  So it comes to this.
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.520]  And now, if full sunlight, bright sunny day,
[12:24.520 --> 12:28.600]  60 moles of photons per meter squared per day times this
[12:28.600 --> 12:31.560]  right here, multiply two numbers together,
[12:31.560 --> 12:34.640]  there's our numbers that I just showed in that slide.
[12:34.640 --> 12:36.400]  That's where this comes from.
[12:36.400 --> 12:39.440]  And this is a little futuristic, but that's OK.
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.240]  I mean, I think we're going to be here in the next few years
[12:43.280 --> 12:45.640]  in terms of the efficiency of lights.
[12:45.640 --> 12:50.680]  But it's still a lot of money to buy photons
[12:50.680 --> 12:52.880]  produced with an electric light.
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.480]  So now we take the without sunlight part of this talk,
[12:58.480 --> 13:00.160]  and we put a box around it.
[13:00.160 --> 13:05.440]  This is the exact same thing, only with a box around it
[13:05.440 --> 13:07.200]  for indoors.
[13:07.200 --> 13:11.000]  Now, how do we make this balance?
[13:11.040 --> 13:14.520]  Fossil fuels for the electric lights.
[13:14.520 --> 13:17.680]  It's a massive input of electricity
[13:17.680 --> 13:20.560]  to replace sunlight.
[13:20.560 --> 13:23.200]  And when I do the math on this, and I
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.160]  start to calculate exactly the efficiencies,
[13:27.160 --> 13:30.440]  this is a little too big.
[13:30.440 --> 13:32.120]  It could be a little smaller, just
[13:32.120 --> 13:33.960]  because electric lights are smaller,
[13:33.960 --> 13:36.320]  and we can get lower intensities.
[13:36.320 --> 13:41.080]  But still, the size of this arrow is big.
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.000]  So how do we run indoor agriculture,
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.840]  given this picture right here?
[13:47.840 --> 13:54.960]  Well, a huge part of it is it's closed so we can elevate CO2.
[13:54.960 --> 13:57.400]  And that's universally done.
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.040]  If you're going to enclose it, that's
[14:00.040 --> 14:02.080]  one of the biggest reasons to enclose it,
[14:02.080 --> 14:05.360]  is so we can elevate CO2.
[14:05.400 --> 14:10.320]  And that is associated with about a 30% yield increase.
[14:10.320 --> 14:12.560]  Photorespiration and all this stuff,
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.280]  Tim Sitter was just in here teaching this stuff a minute
[14:15.280 --> 14:17.960]  ago in this class.
[14:17.960 --> 14:20.760]  It's about a 30% yield increase, but that easily
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.640]  pays for the cost of CO2.
[14:23.640 --> 14:24.680]  So cool.
[14:24.680 --> 14:28.680]  And like I say, we're working on this for the whole planet,
[14:28.680 --> 14:31.200]  trying to get CO2 up to make agriculture
[14:31.200 --> 14:34.440]  more efficient than the field.
[14:34.440 --> 14:38.720]  But so now we get that added efficiency,
[14:38.720 --> 14:40.560]  and that's part of the reason this arrow can
[14:40.560 --> 14:43.240]  be a bit smaller.
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.080]  But one of the common claims, in fact,
[14:47.080 --> 14:50.760]  not common, universal claims about indoor agriculture
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.440]  is incredible water use efficiency.
[14:54.440 --> 14:57.600]  You see the claims, 1,000 times more water use
[14:57.600 --> 14:59.640]  efficient than the field.
[14:59.640 --> 15:00.520]  So what's going on?
[15:00.520 --> 15:02.520]  Have these plants got their stomates closed?
[15:02.520 --> 15:04.280]  They're not breathing?
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.840]  How do they get this water use efficiency?
[15:08.840 --> 15:10.920]  Dehumidification.
[15:10.920 --> 15:14.480]  Plug in a dehumidifier, the transferration
[15:14.480 --> 15:16.560]  rates almost the same.
[15:16.560 --> 15:19.160]  CO2 closes stomates some.
[15:19.160 --> 15:21.120]  So it still goes to water vapor, but we
[15:21.120 --> 15:23.480]  don't let the water vapor escape.
[15:23.480 --> 15:26.240]  And on the Earth, it escapes, and it blows back to the ocean
[15:26.240 --> 15:29.000]  and gets mixed with saltwater.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.240]  We trap the water vapor and condense it and put it back
[15:32.280 --> 15:34.320]  on the crop.
[15:34.320 --> 15:37.520]  So when you think about this, the water in this thing
[15:37.520 --> 15:39.400]  almost could come down to the water that's
[15:39.400 --> 15:41.360]  in the produce itself.
[15:41.360 --> 15:42.680]  No added irrigation.
[15:42.680 --> 15:45.640]  It's just recycled and recycled.
[15:45.640 --> 15:46.960]  What a wonderful thing.
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.680]  And if we're out of water, this is
[15:49.680 --> 15:51.120]  going to make a lot of sense.
[15:51.120 --> 15:54.280]  And now you're going to say, well, Dr. Bugbee,
[15:54.280 --> 15:57.880]  couldn't we just plug in a dehumidifier in the field?
[15:57.880 --> 16:01.640]  Yes, we could, but it takes a lot more energy
[16:01.640 --> 16:04.200]  when it's low humidity to do that.
[16:04.200 --> 16:07.640]  But we could literally take electric energy,
[16:07.640 --> 16:10.880]  condense water vapor out of the air and irrigate our crops.
[16:10.880 --> 16:14.480]  Just not cost effective in the field.
[16:14.480 --> 16:20.560]  But it will be cost effective here when we run out of water.
[16:20.560 --> 16:22.520]  But guess what?
[16:22.520 --> 16:25.880]  It takes energy to run the dehumidifier.
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.640]  Boom, now we get fossil fuels to dehumidify the air.
[16:29.680 --> 16:30.720]  More energy input.
[16:30.720 --> 16:36.200]  But if water is more precious than energy, this makes sense.
[16:36.200 --> 16:38.680]  And it might well come to that.
[16:38.680 --> 16:43.960]  This arrow is smaller than this because we can use heat pumps.
[16:43.960 --> 16:47.840]  And it takes less energy to condense water
[16:47.840 --> 16:53.120]  than it does to run the pure electricity for the lights.
[16:53.120 --> 16:55.520]  There's a lot of ways we can do this in a cold climate.
[16:56.080 --> 16:59.640]  Just run cold air through the pipes.
[16:59.640 --> 17:05.120]  So there's a model of where we're at with conserving water.
[17:05.120 --> 17:08.400]  And this is something I wish people promoting this
[17:08.400 --> 17:09.120]  would explain.
[17:09.120 --> 17:11.120]  There's nothing wrong with this.
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.640]  It's just that condensing the water doesn't come for free.
[17:16.640 --> 17:19.840]  It's not like the plants actually use less water.
[17:19.840 --> 17:25.160]  We just can capture it and put it back on the plant.
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.680]  So now, I've worked in this diagram a while.
[17:30.680 --> 17:34.400]  But people say, well, yeah, your big black arrows,
[17:34.400 --> 17:36.400]  we just use solar panels for those.
[17:36.400 --> 17:38.080]  And it's all good.
[17:38.080 --> 17:41.560]  And now the sun is electricity.
[17:41.560 --> 17:44.280]  So I'd like to take a close look at this.
[17:44.280 --> 17:48.880]  Can we use solar panels to run this farm?
[17:48.880 --> 17:50.440]  So this is sunlight.
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.320]  And here's our 60 moles a day, a bright, sunny day.
[17:54.360 --> 17:58.040]  This is the quantum flux from the sun, moles of photons.
[17:58.040 --> 18:01.280]  The energy flux, the exact same sunlight,
[18:01.280 --> 18:04.120]  is 30 megajoules per day.
[18:04.120 --> 18:05.520]  Just two different instruments.
[18:05.520 --> 18:08.000]  One's measuring energy and one's measuring
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.360]  photosynthetic photons.
[18:10.360 --> 18:13.440]  And on this side, I'm going to show a greenhouse.
[18:13.440 --> 18:17.200]  And on this side, I'm going to show indoor farms.
[18:17.200 --> 18:19.480]  So we first take a greenhouse.
[18:19.520 --> 18:22.880]  And a design goal for greenhouses
[18:22.880 --> 18:24.800]  is 70% transmission.
[18:24.800 --> 18:26.560]  We don't always quite get to that.
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.200]  But we can with state of the art.
[18:29.200 --> 18:33.080]  70 times 60, we get 42 moles per meter squared per day
[18:33.080 --> 18:36.080]  inside the greenhouse.
[18:36.080 --> 18:41.120]  How close can we get with electric lights?
[18:41.120 --> 18:44.160]  Solar photovoltaics, the commercial versions,
[18:44.160 --> 18:46.440]  get up to 20% efficient.
[18:46.440 --> 18:47.600]  I have them on my house.
[18:47.640 --> 18:49.480]  They started 19%.
[18:49.480 --> 18:51.960]  Now they're down to 17%.
[18:51.960 --> 18:54.840]  But still, we can get close to 20%.
[18:54.840 --> 18:58.600]  So that 30 turns into 6 megajoules
[18:58.600 --> 19:01.840]  of electricity per day.
[19:01.840 --> 19:08.600]  Now we multiply by the very best LEDs, 3.5.
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.920]  That's what I showed in the other slide.
[19:11.920 --> 19:14.600]  We're getting close to some purple LEDs
[19:14.600 --> 19:18.480]  that are close to 3.5 micromoles per joule.
[19:18.480 --> 19:23.000]  So this number, the mega and the micro cancel once again.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.240]  And the product is 21.
[19:26.240 --> 19:31.160]  So if we take the same sunlight, run it through solar panels,
[19:31.160 --> 19:36.680]  run it through LEDs, we get half of the photon flux
[19:36.680 --> 19:39.680]  per unit area of sunlight.
[19:39.680 --> 19:44.480]  And this is even a little bit futuristic, half.
[19:44.480 --> 19:49.200]  So what that means is if we take two acres of solar panels,
[19:49.200 --> 19:50.800]  this is a picture off the internet.
[19:50.800 --> 19:53.600]  It looks like really nice farmland.
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.120]  And it got solar panels on it.
[19:55.120 --> 19:55.680]  I'm not sure.
[19:55.680 --> 20:01.600]  But we can run one acre of LEDs at full sunlight.
[20:01.600 --> 20:04.400]  This is not a really favorable ratio.
[20:04.400 --> 20:08.200]  But it does make the point when people make skyscrapers
[20:08.200 --> 20:12.640]  with 30 levels, and then the solar panels are on the roof.
[20:12.720 --> 20:14.720]  Oh, right.
[20:14.720 --> 20:16.840]  Those solar panels are going to provide sunlight.
[20:16.840 --> 20:19.040]  It's not going to happen.
[20:19.040 --> 20:24.120]  But when you think about this, this is full sunlight.
[20:24.120 --> 20:26.000]  And this is now.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.360]  Now I'd like to take a look at the potential of this.
[20:29.360 --> 20:32.640]  Not just what we have now, but what it could be.
[20:32.640 --> 20:35.240]  Same diagram.
[20:35.240 --> 20:36.960]  Greenhouse is the same.
[20:36.960 --> 20:38.760]  Now maybe it will get better coverings.
[20:38.760 --> 20:40.600]  Maybe this number will go up.
[20:40.600 --> 20:43.760]  But for now, let's keep the greenhouse the same.
[20:43.760 --> 20:46.520]  Now solar panels 30% efficient.
[20:46.520 --> 20:49.880]  Those solar panels that NASA launches on satellites,
[20:49.880 --> 20:53.840]  those are about 30 in the low 30s per percent efficiency.
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.720]  Those are super expensive panels.
[20:58.600 --> 21:00.640]  Let me do another little sidebar.
[21:00.640 --> 21:02.160]  This is a really interesting number.
[21:02.160 --> 21:06.120]  I have a lecture on the efficiency of photosynthesis
[21:06.120 --> 21:10.240]  and the efficiency of solar photovoltaics.
[21:10.280 --> 21:15.480]  Both processes follow what's called the Stark-Einstein law,
[21:15.480 --> 21:19.840]  which says one photon excites one electron.
[21:19.840 --> 21:22.720]  And I love being able to quote something from Einstein
[21:22.720 --> 21:25.400]  that I can understand one to one.
[21:25.400 --> 21:28.920]  So one photon from sunlight excites one electron
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.200]  in a solar panel.
[21:30.200 --> 21:33.920]  And that's the first step in photosynthesis too.
[21:33.920 --> 21:38.120]  Photosynthesis, in theory, can get to 30% efficient.
[21:38.120 --> 21:43.160]  And in practice, we get into the mid-20s percent efficient.
[21:43.160 --> 21:48.200]  But why is photovoltaics better than solar panels?
[21:48.200 --> 21:50.000]  Here's the reason.
[21:50.000 --> 21:50.920]  Here's wavelength.
[21:50.920 --> 21:53.160]  This is sunlight.
[21:53.160 --> 21:55.760]  With solar panels, we can layer panels.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.720]  And if this was plants, we'd roughly
[21:57.720 --> 22:00.560]  be using this blue region down here.
[22:00.560 --> 22:05.320]  And after 700, 750 nanometers, the photons
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.320]  are too low energy.
[22:06.320 --> 22:07.080]  We can't use them.
[22:07.080 --> 22:11.840]  But we have solar panel coatings that can capture lower energy
[22:11.840 --> 22:12.880]  photons out here.
[22:12.880 --> 22:15.360]  And you add the colors together, and you
[22:15.360 --> 22:18.360]  get the beats photosynthesis because they
[22:18.360 --> 22:22.720]  can use lower energy photons in a solar panel.
[22:22.720 --> 22:24.920]  All right, 30% efficient.
[22:24.920 --> 22:26.520]  Now we're up to 9.
[22:26.520 --> 22:29.200]  Now we run these through LEDs.
[22:29.200 --> 22:32.840]  The theoretical maximum efficiency of solar panels
[22:32.840 --> 22:36.960]  is about 5 micromoles per joule.
[22:36.960 --> 22:39.680]  Here's this Planck's equation, inversely proportional
[22:39.680 --> 22:41.600]  to wavelength.
[22:41.600 --> 22:43.960]  But I don't think we're ever going
[22:43.960 --> 22:46.200]  to get 100% efficiency of LEDs.
[22:46.200 --> 22:50.200]  But I think we'll get to 90% efficient.
[22:50.200 --> 22:51.280]  So we're close.
[22:51.280 --> 22:54.880]  Now, 9 times 4.
[22:54.880 --> 22:56.800]  Now we're equal.
[22:56.800 --> 22:59.840]  Now one acre of solar panels gives us
[22:59.840 --> 23:04.400]  one acre of full sunlight with electric energy.
[23:04.400 --> 23:07.240]  And I don't know how long it's going to take us to get there.
[23:07.240 --> 23:09.640]  But we're headed in this direction.
[23:09.640 --> 23:11.960]  Now here's another key thing.
[23:11.960 --> 23:14.400]  What if this is a cloudy day?
[23:14.400 --> 23:16.040]  Well, everything scales.
[23:16.040 --> 23:17.080]  The energy goes down.
[23:17.080 --> 23:17.760]  This goes down.
[23:17.760 --> 23:21.120]  It's still a one-to-one ratio.
[23:21.120 --> 23:25.920]  But if you're in plant science, do we grow lettuce
[23:25.920 --> 23:28.560]  indoors under full sunlight?
[23:28.560 --> 23:31.320]  No, we do not.
[23:31.360 --> 23:35.240]  500 micromoles is plenty to grow lettuce.
[23:35.240 --> 23:37.720]  And that's a quarter of full sunlight.
[23:37.720 --> 23:40.080]  So with electricity, we can take this light
[23:40.080 --> 23:43.360]  and spread it out over more acres.
[23:43.360 --> 23:46.040]  So now we have more acres of indoor production
[23:46.040 --> 23:49.480]  than we have acres of solar panels.
[23:49.480 --> 23:55.400]  But we can't store electricity.
[23:55.400 --> 23:57.800]  Or at least, we don't have efficient ways
[23:57.800 --> 24:00.120]  to store electricity.
[24:00.120 --> 24:04.400]  So if it's a dark day, you want to concentrate this.
[24:04.400 --> 24:06.400]  If it's a sunny day, you can spread it out.
[24:06.400 --> 24:09.320]  Every day is different.
[24:09.320 --> 24:11.200]  But here's a key point.
[24:11.200 --> 24:13.280]  Even though we don't have cost-effective ways
[24:13.280 --> 24:16.480]  to store energy for the long term,
[24:16.480 --> 24:18.080]  there's a lot of options to store it
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.640]  for a period of hours, not days and weeks like an electric car.
[24:23.640 --> 24:25.720]  But run a pump.
[24:25.720 --> 24:27.160]  Pump water uphill.
[24:27.160 --> 24:29.520]  And then at night, the water runs down.
[24:29.520 --> 24:30.720]  He'll do hydroelectric.
[24:30.720 --> 24:34.360]  So a lot of things we do to store energy
[24:34.360 --> 24:36.440]  for short periods of time.
[24:36.440 --> 24:39.480]  So now we can take those peak sunny days,
[24:39.480 --> 24:41.400]  store the electricity for a few hours,
[24:41.400 --> 24:45.280]  and have a 16-hour photo period year round
[24:45.280 --> 24:48.120]  with a low level of light.
[24:48.120 --> 24:50.800]  So that's a very key part of indoor agriculture
[24:50.800 --> 24:53.480]  is distributing these photons in time
[24:53.480 --> 24:56.560]  to make the system maximally efficient.
[24:56.560 --> 24:59.640]  Right now, we just buy electricity off the grid.
[24:59.640 --> 25:01.840]  But if we're going to look at something sustainable,
[25:01.840 --> 25:02.680]  we can't do that.
[25:02.680 --> 25:06.240]  We've got to do it with solar panels.
[25:06.240 --> 25:12.120]  So this is where I can, we have a smart board for recording.
[25:12.120 --> 25:16.360]  And I could put black slides and do calculations on the board.
[25:16.360 --> 25:19.960]  But that would ruin this screen if we did that.
[25:19.960 --> 25:26.560]  And I'm going to switch to calculating yield, potential
[25:26.560 --> 25:29.640]  yield in a controlled environment,
[25:29.640 --> 25:34.320]  because this is key to the whole thing, how high can yield get.
[25:34.320 --> 25:35.880]  And I see people all the time saying,
[25:35.880 --> 25:38.160]  we have no idea how high yield can be.
[25:38.160 --> 25:38.840]  What do you mean?
[25:38.840 --> 25:41.320]  We know the efficiency of photosynthesis.
[25:41.320 --> 25:43.240]  We can calculate that.
[25:43.240 --> 25:45.400]  Yet you should quit saying we have no idea.
[25:45.920 --> 25:48.840]  This is one of the papers very early in my career.
[25:48.840 --> 25:50.440]  And if you're a really old geezer,
[25:50.440 --> 25:55.640]  you remember Frank Salisbury's plant physiology textbook.
[25:55.640 --> 25:58.600]  He was one of the reasons I went to Utah
[25:58.600 --> 26:02.720]  to work with him as a young scientist.
[26:02.720 --> 26:05.000]  Exploring the limits of productivity,
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  1988, published in the journal Plant Physiology.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.760]  And it was this four-component model
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.680]  that helps us calculate potential yield.
[26:16.680 --> 26:19.640]  So we start with moles of photons in.
[26:19.640 --> 26:22.640]  And it would just take a one up here.
[26:22.640 --> 26:27.520]  We assume, in this case, 80% capture of light.
[26:27.520 --> 26:30.280]  Now, when a crop is filled in, it's
[26:30.280 --> 26:32.840]  probably 95% capture of light.
[26:32.840 --> 26:35.240]  But it always takes a while to get there.
[26:35.240 --> 26:37.960]  And you have to average in the low capture in the beginning
[26:37.960 --> 26:39.120]  with the high.
[26:39.240 --> 26:40.480]  This is a very high number.
[26:40.480 --> 26:41.600]  But lettuce can get there.
[26:41.600 --> 26:44.720]  High density lettuce, 80% capture of photons.
[26:44.720 --> 26:48.200]  If photons hit the ground, you're wasted.
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.920]  Then the next step is quantum yield, moles of carbon
[26:52.920 --> 26:56.040]  fixed per mole of photons.
[26:56.040 --> 26:57.760]  And this is a less well-known number.
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.080]  But with CO2 enrichment, we can get to 0.6.
[27:02.080 --> 27:04.480]  Now, this is heavily dependent on light intensity.
[27:04.480 --> 27:07.200]  The higher the light, the lower the yield.
[27:07.560 --> 27:10.440]  The higher the light, the lower this number.
[27:10.440 --> 27:12.320]  But for low light lettuce, 0.06.
[27:12.320 --> 27:15.960]  That's a very excellent number for perfect lettuce.
[27:15.960 --> 27:19.480]  No problems anywhere.
[27:19.480 --> 27:23.800]  Then we have to multiply that by respiration efficiency
[27:23.800 --> 27:25.280]  of the plant.
[27:25.280 --> 27:27.840]  We sort of go two steps forward in the day
[27:27.840 --> 27:31.360]  and one step back at night as the plant synthesizes
[27:31.360 --> 27:34.120]  proteins and other things.
[27:34.120 --> 27:36.680]  And this is now a well-studied number.
[27:36.680 --> 27:40.160]  And 60% efficiency in respiration
[27:40.160 --> 27:42.080]  is the widely used number.
[27:42.080 --> 27:45.080]  And this is successive multiplication, 0.8 times
[27:45.080 --> 27:47.320]  0.06 times 0.6.
[27:47.320 --> 27:51.400]  Harvest index is the edible part divided by the total.
[27:51.400 --> 27:54.200]  And in the case of lettuce, 90%.
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.600]  I mean, it's incredible.
[27:55.600 --> 27:58.800]  Just a tiny bit of stem base and roots.
[27:58.800 --> 28:01.560]  This is why lettuce is so good.
[28:01.560 --> 28:03.840]  You multiply those four together,
[28:03.880 --> 28:08.440]  we get moles of carbon fixed per mole of photons.
[28:08.440 --> 28:12.360]  And then we can multiply by the ratio of weight
[28:12.360 --> 28:14.720]  of the plant by carbon.
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.360]  That's 30 grams per mole.
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.240]  0.07 grams per mole.
[28:22.240 --> 28:26.720]  That's another really, really useful number.
[28:26.720 --> 28:28.680]  But it's hard to remember 0.07.
[28:28.680 --> 28:32.000]  I like to remember numbers that are more like 1,
[28:32.040 --> 28:35.600]  like a penny per mole of photons.
[28:35.600 --> 28:37.880]  So let's put in potential.
[28:37.880 --> 28:39.840]  What we think we could get, the 80
[28:39.840 --> 28:42.920]  goes to 90 with variable spacing.
[28:42.920 --> 28:44.160]  Maybe a little lower light.
[28:44.160 --> 28:45.600]  This inches up.
[28:45.600 --> 28:49.360]  We do cool nights to preserve carbon, 65.
[28:49.360 --> 28:52.840]  Harvest index, now we get to 1.
[28:52.840 --> 28:57.360]  So this number is what I've used in lots of models
[28:57.360 --> 28:59.560]  to say potential yield.
[28:59.560 --> 29:01.320]  If everything's just right, and it only
[29:01.360 --> 29:04.800]  works with lettuce or leafy greens because
[29:04.800 --> 29:07.840]  of this super high harvest index.
[29:07.840 --> 29:10.480]  Many of you may know our field crops.
[29:10.480 --> 29:13.000]  Harvest indexes are more like 40%.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.480]  And with plant breeding, we're at 45%.
[29:15.480 --> 29:18.960]  And we're way under half of this number.
[29:18.960 --> 29:23.040]  But with lettuce, we can get to 1.
[29:23.040 --> 29:30.520]  So now we can do some economic analysis with this,
[29:30.560 --> 29:33.400]  because we're going to say we can produce
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.800]  a gram of dry weight per mole of photons.
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.240]  And the photons cost a penny per mole.
[29:41.240 --> 29:43.600]  So let's take a look at that.
[29:43.600 --> 29:46.920]  This is a paper with some colleagues.
[29:46.920 --> 29:48.320]  We sent this to science.
[29:48.320 --> 29:49.960]  They said, no, we're not interested.
[29:49.960 --> 29:53.040]  But nature took the paper.
[29:53.040 --> 29:56.440]  And that's pretty common to get them to even take
[29:56.440 --> 29:58.200]  a paper for review.
[29:58.200 --> 30:01.720]  Photons for physiology and food.
[30:01.720 --> 30:05.440]  This is the cost of the electricity
[30:05.440 --> 30:08.120]  divided by the value of the crop.
[30:08.120 --> 30:12.360]  And microgreens and lettuce, this is like a no-brainer.
[30:12.360 --> 30:14.680]  The electricity, 1% to 5%.
[30:14.680 --> 30:17.280]  Microgreens are a lot better than lettuce,
[30:17.280 --> 30:20.120]  because they're real high water, real high harvest index,
[30:20.120 --> 30:22.360]  real high photon capture.
[30:22.360 --> 30:25.560]  But both of these are really favorable,
[30:25.560 --> 30:27.840]  because the photons didn't cost that much.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.240]  Now let's do tomatoes.
[30:31.240 --> 30:34.880]  Now tomatoes have a much lower harvest index.
[30:34.880 --> 30:36.280]  There's a lot of stems and leaves.
[30:36.280 --> 30:37.840]  We throw them away.
[30:37.840 --> 30:40.560]  Tomatoes are also less water.
[30:40.560 --> 30:46.280]  This is assuming 95% water, because that's what we sell,
[30:46.280 --> 30:48.240]  is fresh weight.
[30:48.240 --> 30:52.240]  Tomatoes are less water, lower harvest index.
[30:52.240 --> 30:55.800]  That number jumps to 18%.
[30:55.840 --> 31:01.040]  So suddenly, tomatoes are four times as hard to do as lettuce.
[31:01.040 --> 31:07.000]  But depending on the other costs in the system, 18% still OK.
[31:07.000 --> 31:12.200]  We have the value of the product justifies the electric bill.
[31:12.200 --> 31:13.120]  Now let's keep going.
[31:13.120 --> 31:16.600]  And you're doing strawberry research here.
[31:16.600 --> 31:20.120]  In this paper, I calculated this for other vegetables,
[31:20.120 --> 31:21.840]  like broccoli.
[31:21.840 --> 31:24.280]  These are things with lower harvest index
[31:24.280 --> 31:26.240]  and higher percent dry weight.
[31:26.240 --> 31:31.040]  So they're harder to do economically.
[31:31.040 --> 31:35.240]  And I just put general vegetables, 103%.
[31:35.240 --> 31:39.800]  So just the cost of electricity at current value
[31:39.800 --> 31:43.440]  of electricity and the market value of the product,
[31:43.440 --> 31:45.600]  you could sell them and pay the electric bill
[31:45.600 --> 31:46.800]  at no other cost.
[31:46.800 --> 31:48.280]  You couldn't pay air conditioning.
[31:48.280 --> 31:49.840]  You couldn't pay labor, nothing.
[31:49.840 --> 31:54.600]  Just they're equal to the cost of the electricity to grow.
[31:54.600 --> 31:57.920]  The point here is it gets rapidly harder
[31:57.920 --> 32:04.120]  to grow lower value, higher dry weight crops
[32:04.120 --> 32:06.760]  with electric lights.
[32:06.760 --> 32:09.840]  So if that's the case, some people
[32:09.840 --> 32:12.640]  say field agriculture is dead.
[32:12.640 --> 32:16.360]  We're going to grow wheat and rice in here.
[32:16.400 --> 32:22.000]  Now wheat and rice are real low value and real high dry weight.
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.840]  100 times.
[32:23.840 --> 32:27.080]  The cost of the electricity just to run the lights
[32:27.080 --> 32:31.400]  is 100 times more than the value of those crops.
[32:31.400 --> 32:34.920]  Unless we are really, really out of water,
[32:34.920 --> 32:39.160]  we are not going to be growing wheat and rice
[32:39.160 --> 32:40.400]  with electric lights.
[32:40.400 --> 32:45.920]  The economics are not even close to favorable.
[32:45.960 --> 32:50.000]  Doesn't keep people from promoting it and trying.
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.520]  And I'll say in a minute, it depends on some other factors
[32:53.520 --> 32:54.360]  too.
[32:54.360 --> 32:56.800]  So why is this so big?
[32:56.800 --> 32:59.400]  Market price goes from high to low.
[32:59.400 --> 33:03.120]  And then the other big factor is harvest index.
[33:03.120 --> 33:07.160]  Really high harvest index down to low.
[33:07.160 --> 33:09.960]  I showed this slide in Boganingan University
[33:09.960 --> 33:11.880]  just a couple of years ago, right before COVID,
[33:11.880 --> 33:13.840]  or a slide like this.
[33:13.840 --> 33:15.720]  And I don't know if you know Leo Marcellus.
[33:15.720 --> 33:18.960]  He's one of their longstanding researchers.
[33:18.960 --> 33:22.240]  And he jumps up and he says, I can get 70%.
[33:22.240 --> 33:25.880]  And I can get tomatoes that are 90% water.
[33:25.880 --> 33:27.680]  OK.
[33:27.680 --> 33:30.760]  But that means this is maybe more like 10% or something.
[33:30.760 --> 33:32.560]  It's still hard to grow tomatoes.
[33:35.320 --> 33:37.880]  So now let's look at this another way.
[33:37.880 --> 33:42.120]  Well, before I get there, how about shipping?
[33:42.120 --> 33:45.840]  I was motivated to do an analysis of shipping costs
[33:45.840 --> 33:49.360]  because, man, a big truck driving from Southern
[33:49.360 --> 33:54.000]  California to Manhattan or to Ithaca, wow,
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.440]  that just has to be a massive amount of energy.
[33:57.440 --> 34:02.520]  This cannot be cost effective to ship it across the country.
[34:02.520 --> 34:04.320]  So we do some arithmetic.
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.080]  And I had to call up shipping companies and get data.
[34:08.120 --> 34:12.240]  Those big trucks only get 7 miles to the gallon.
[34:12.240 --> 34:18.200]  And diesel fuel is 139,000 kilojoules per gallon.
[34:18.200 --> 34:21.840]  2,800 miles diagonally across the country.
[34:21.840 --> 34:24.600]  You multiply those numbers together.
[34:24.600 --> 34:27.920]  Oh, and the trucks can hold 18,000 kilograms
[34:27.920 --> 34:29.840]  of fresh waste in a big truck.
[34:29.840 --> 34:33.760]  You multiply those four numbers together, the units cancel.
[34:33.760 --> 34:37.880]  3 kilojoules per gram fresh weight.
[34:37.880 --> 34:45.040]  Wow, that is a lot of energy to ship it across the country
[34:45.040 --> 34:48.880]  from, and this is a refrigerator truck, by the way.
[34:48.880 --> 34:49.840]  So it's even more.
[34:49.840 --> 34:52.920]  That's why the mileage is so bad.
[34:52.920 --> 34:55.920]  So how much does it cost for the electricity
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.440]  to grow a gram fresh mass of lettuce?
[35:00.440 --> 35:05.560]  Same math as before, only now one mole of photon
[35:05.560 --> 35:06.800]  is 20 grams fresh.
[35:06.880 --> 35:11.280]  This is 5% dry weight.
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.520]  Our very best electric lights, 14.
[35:16.520 --> 35:21.200]  The cost of the energy cost of the electricity
[35:21.200 --> 35:27.640]  is about four to five times greater than the shipping cost.
[35:27.640 --> 35:31.840]  This is not an intuitive thing at all.
[35:31.840 --> 35:34.840]  But I've shown this math to several people.
[35:34.840 --> 35:36.400]  And they say, no, it's right.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.680]  And then it turns out Mother Jones Magazine
[35:41.680 --> 35:44.320]  did an article on this some years ago.
[35:44.320 --> 35:46.320]  I didn't know that magazine was still around,
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.200]  but they're thriving.
[35:48.200 --> 35:51.920]  And their article was called House of Chards.
[35:51.920 --> 35:55.640]  And they had my calculations in there on shipping.
[35:55.640 --> 35:59.640]  And indoor agriculture is a wonderful thing,
[35:59.640 --> 36:03.320]  but don't tell me it's going to save the planet.
[36:03.320 --> 36:05.640]  It'll save the planet if we can get people
[36:05.680 --> 36:08.000]  eating more fresh fruits and vegetables.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.360]  That's a great thing.
[36:09.360 --> 36:10.640]  They're wonderful.
[36:10.640 --> 36:11.840]  And that's a huge thing.
[36:11.840 --> 36:14.600]  And it'll save the planet if we're out of water.
[36:14.600 --> 36:17.560]  But we're not going to get there on an energy basis.
[36:17.560 --> 36:23.400]  That's a staggering difference with the cost of shipping.
[36:23.400 --> 36:28.400]  Now, this slide was inspired.
[36:28.400 --> 36:31.560]  If you read the fine print, look at the authors on this.
[36:31.560 --> 36:33.760]  David de Villiers.
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.000]  We read Lou Albrecht, 2011.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.800]  Energy use and yields in tomato production,
[36:41.800 --> 36:43.840]  field high tunnel, and greenhouse
[36:43.840 --> 36:46.920]  compared to the northern tier of the USA.
[36:46.920 --> 36:50.640]  This is a great paper, now 10 years old.
[36:50.640 --> 36:53.200]  And I took the numbers from this paper
[36:53.200 --> 36:55.240]  and adapted them to make this graphic.
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.880]  And there's Lou Albrecht, who I understand
[36:59.920 --> 37:03.640]  is as sharp as ever just in assisted care living.
[37:03.640 --> 37:06.200]  But he inspired me early to do this stuff.
[37:06.200 --> 37:09.120]  So let's take a look at this.
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.640]  Grown and shipped, these are kilograms,
[37:12.640 --> 37:16.240]  CO2 equivalent per kilogram of tomatoes.
[37:16.240 --> 37:17.880]  Transferred 0.3 to bucks.
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.480]  And so the sum of these two is 0.6 kilogram equivalents.
[37:22.480 --> 37:24.360]  Hoop houses, wow, they're wonderful.
[37:24.360 --> 37:27.880]  Now, only in season, but there's no shipping.
[37:27.880 --> 37:31.760]  They're wonderfully efficient right to the consumer.
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.480]  Heated greenhouse, heating is a big penalty.
[37:36.480 --> 37:38.520]  And the production costs are a little bit higher
[37:38.520 --> 37:42.200]  because very intensive fertilization and watering
[37:42.200 --> 37:43.320]  and care.
[37:43.320 --> 37:45.960]  But now look at indoor farming.
[37:45.960 --> 37:48.240]  The electricity cost is big.
[37:48.240 --> 37:53.640]  Now, this is kilogram CO2 equivalents for this.
[37:53.680 --> 37:55.640]  So you add these numbers together
[37:55.640 --> 37:58.880]  to get the comparison for tomatoes.
[38:01.560 --> 38:03.720]  What about lettuce?
[38:03.720 --> 38:07.400]  This was inspired by Mike Ham, a professor at Michigan State.
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.320]  This is a paper he wrote on a similar thing.
[38:11.320 --> 38:13.600]  Transport is more for lettuce.
[38:13.600 --> 38:14.680]  Doesn't ship as well.
[38:14.680 --> 38:17.480]  You've got to ship it faster, refrigerated.
[38:17.480 --> 38:19.840]  Hoop house are still very efficient.
[38:19.840 --> 38:23.240]  Heated greenhouse, the story is similar.
[38:23.320 --> 38:27.720]  We just have to add in the electricity for lettuce.
[38:27.720 --> 38:30.480]  Now, this is not cost.
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.880]  This is not the economics.
[38:32.880 --> 38:35.840]  This is kilograms of CO2 equivalents.
[38:35.840 --> 38:39.760]  And if we're interested in reducing our carbon footprint,
[38:39.760 --> 38:42.240]  this is what matters.
[38:42.240 --> 38:45.600]  We've got to find a way to get this number small with solar
[38:45.600 --> 38:50.400]  panels to make this system work.
[38:50.400 --> 38:53.120]  But it does say, wow, really simple things
[38:53.160 --> 38:56.280]  like hoop houses are wonderfully efficient,
[38:56.280 --> 39:03.440]  except for labor to do all this work in a hoop house.
[39:03.440 --> 39:07.360]  One more slide on economics.
[39:07.360 --> 39:12.240]  If we take the same numbers we did before,
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.320]  cost of electricity, efficiency of the lights,
[39:15.320 --> 39:19.560]  multiply them together, and we get 0.5 grams per mole
[39:19.600 --> 39:23.280]  from our yield model, we can grow
[39:23.280 --> 39:30.200]  a kilogram of dry weight of food for $24 of electricity.
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.680]  It's just the electricity, not anything else.
[39:34.680 --> 39:39.120]  So now let's look at the value of the products,
[39:39.120 --> 39:41.360]  starting with wheat.
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.360]  Organic wheat, high value.
[39:44.360 --> 39:49.160]  Wheat's about $4 a bushel, but organic wheat's $9.
[39:49.240 --> 39:54.720]  That comes out to $0.32 per kilogram of wheat.
[39:54.720 --> 39:59.040]  This number is a lot bigger than this number.
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.760]  It's unless something else becomes radically limiting,
[40:02.760 --> 40:05.280]  doesn't make sense to do wheat.
[40:05.280 --> 40:06.880]  How about tomatoes?
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.320]  This is a high priced, organic, high value tomatoes.
[40:12.320 --> 40:14.120]  They're 90% water.
[40:14.120 --> 40:16.280]  That's huge.
[40:16.320 --> 40:19.640]  $100 a kilogram, that number is bigger than that.
[40:19.640 --> 40:22.640]  So now, as long as it's a high value crop
[40:22.640 --> 40:26.760]  and we can sell the water for fresh produce, makes sense.
[40:26.760 --> 40:28.760]  And tomatoes are even better.
[40:28.760 --> 40:30.920]  95% water.
[40:30.920 --> 40:33.240]  So these two numbers exceed that.
[40:33.240 --> 40:37.600]  But it helps to show the challenges of different crops
[40:37.600 --> 40:39.480]  in indoor agriculture.
[40:39.480 --> 40:41.920]  Some of them make immediate economic sense,
[40:41.920 --> 40:47.400]  and others are very challenging.
[40:47.400 --> 40:50.480]  Arrow Farms has been working on growing strawberries.
[40:50.480 --> 40:53.240]  And I'm thinking, oh, you know how hard strawberries
[40:53.240 --> 40:53.760]  are to grow?
[40:53.760 --> 40:55.920]  I mean, way harder than lettuce.
[40:55.920 --> 40:59.640]  Not just the crop itself, but the economics.
[40:59.640 --> 41:02.640]  And I, well, they're not there yet.
[41:02.640 --> 41:03.720]  Strawberries are tough.
[41:07.520 --> 41:10.080]  I'm going to close.
[41:10.080 --> 41:10.920]  Yeah, how many?
[41:10.920 --> 41:12.640]  About five or six minutes.
[41:12.640 --> 41:14.200]  That's why I said I'm going to close.
[41:14.200 --> 41:17.160]  I'm watching the clock.
[41:17.160 --> 41:21.040]  I got just a couple, two slides left.
[41:21.040 --> 41:25.160]  I've done a bunch of analysis, which I'm not going to show you.
[41:25.160 --> 41:27.040]  But it's pretty simple.
[41:27.040 --> 41:32.080]  In a greenhouse, you pay for the heat and the light's free.
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.240]  And so what's the ratio of joules of energy per heat
[41:35.240 --> 41:36.760]  to photons of light?
[41:36.760 --> 41:39.680]  We can call this one micromoles per joule
[41:39.680 --> 41:41.240]  that we're getting in a greenhouse.
[41:41.240 --> 41:44.440]  And over here, the heat is free, and we
[41:44.440 --> 41:49.920]  pay for the electricity, three micromoles per joule.
[41:49.920 --> 41:51.560]  So how does this compare?
[41:51.560 --> 41:55.360]  Not surprisingly, here's light through a season.
[41:55.360 --> 41:56.960]  This happens to be in Logan, Utah,
[41:56.960 --> 41:59.120]  but you get similar things here.
[41:59.120 --> 42:00.480]  Dark in the winter.
[42:00.480 --> 42:03.200]  Here's an average.
[42:03.200 --> 42:05.120]  In these dark months, indoor farming
[42:05.120 --> 42:08.880]  clearly works because the electricity is
[42:08.920 --> 42:10.440]  cheaper than the sun.
[42:10.440 --> 42:11.840]  Here it doesn't.
[42:11.840 --> 42:13.840]  And I went through a bunch of calculations
[42:13.840 --> 42:15.600]  to see when it's cost effective.
[42:15.600 --> 42:20.320]  And then I had an opportunity to meet this young scientist, Luke
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.400]  Grams at Wageningen.
[42:23.400 --> 42:26.880]  And he published this paper, Plant Factories
[42:26.880 --> 42:31.640]  versus Greenhouse, Comparison of Resource Use Efficiency.
[42:31.640 --> 42:33.880]  And to make a long story short, he
[42:33.880 --> 42:35.840]  said this is a no-brainer.
[42:35.840 --> 42:39.800]  In these polar regions, indoor farming always wins.
[42:39.800 --> 42:43.240]  And in the middle latitudes, it doesn't win.
[42:43.240 --> 42:44.600]  If you're interested in this, I'd
[42:44.600 --> 42:47.080]  recommend his paper because it's full of equations
[42:47.080 --> 42:53.040]  and the details and the resources for this.
[42:53.040 --> 42:56.000]  One of the things he does is water in that paper.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.440]  And these blue dots are where indoor agriculture makes sense
[42:59.440 --> 43:01.240]  because we're out of water.
[43:01.240 --> 43:05.200]  And it could be very efficient for water.
[43:05.240 --> 43:11.160]  So water and energy are the two big factors.
[43:11.160 --> 43:13.800]  I'll close on one slide.
[43:13.800 --> 43:16.840]  The biggest advantage of indoor ag to me
[43:16.840 --> 43:19.560]  is it can be very automated.
[43:19.560 --> 43:24.080]  Shelves of plants, the labor bill goes way down.
[43:24.080 --> 43:28.960]  And we're having trouble getting labor for agriculture.
[43:28.960 --> 43:31.120]  The biggest disadvantage is electricity.
[43:31.120 --> 43:33.600]  So now it works because this cost goes down
[43:33.600 --> 43:35.000]  and this cost goes up.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.040]  And we can, we're at least on the threshold
[43:38.040 --> 43:45.760]  of doing this economically for sure for lettuce and microgreens.
[43:45.760 --> 43:47.880]  But it's going to be a while before we get there
[43:47.880 --> 43:50.240]  with some of the other crops.
[43:50.240 --> 43:54.680]  Even crops like broccoli, it's just much harder.
[43:54.680 --> 44:00.080]  So I'm going to stop there and take questions.
[44:00.080 --> 44:02.520]  We don't have anything from Geneva at the moment.
[44:02.600 --> 44:03.320]  Anybody?
[44:03.320 --> 44:04.680]  Any questions here?
[44:04.680 --> 44:07.640]  Can you go back to the economics slide?
[44:07.640 --> 44:12.960]  Those slides before, I was 24 cost of electricity.
[44:12.960 --> 44:13.880]  This one right here?
[44:13.880 --> 44:15.720]  No, the economics.
[44:15.720 --> 44:16.680]  Yeah, right there.
[44:16.680 --> 44:18.560]  I'm just curious what that 24 is.
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.080]  Is that for that factory?
[44:20.080 --> 44:21.840]  This one right here?
[44:21.840 --> 44:24.920]  No, this is just the cost of electricity.
[44:24.920 --> 44:28.560]  Well, this is the cost of electricity right here
[44:28.560 --> 44:30.240]  per mole of photons.
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.000]  This is from the yield model.
[44:33.000 --> 44:39.320]  And now, I just said lettuce, we could get 0.7.
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.640]  But this is for dry weight, not fresh weight.
[44:43.640 --> 44:48.880]  And this is a more, this would be a very high yield
[44:48.880 --> 44:50.600]  for field crops.
[44:50.600 --> 44:55.880]  Field crops, you get to 0.3 maybe grams per mole.
[44:55.880 --> 44:58.560]  This is a high estimate for yield.
[44:58.600 --> 45:03.240]  So I've kind of, it's at least $24 per kilogram
[45:03.240 --> 45:05.760]  and maybe more like 50.
[45:05.760 --> 45:08.560]  But I wanted to make this number as small as possible
[45:08.560 --> 45:10.400]  so people couldn't say I was rounding
[45:10.400 --> 45:12.400]  the numbers in my favor.
[45:12.400 --> 45:13.600]  But that's where it comes from.
[45:13.600 --> 45:18.000]  Cost of electricity times yield per photon.
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.240]  So it's for all the fancy, fancy settings.
[45:21.240 --> 45:23.640]  Or it's for anything.
[45:23.640 --> 45:24.160]  Yeah.
[45:27.160 --> 45:27.800]  Yes?
[45:27.800 --> 45:30.760]  Has anybody done these calculations
[45:30.760 --> 45:33.000]  per calorie produced?
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.680]  Because lettuce and tomatoes, full dressing, but.
[45:36.680 --> 45:37.480]  Yeah.
[45:37.480 --> 45:38.600]  Sure.
[45:38.600 --> 45:40.480]  Sure they have.
[45:40.480 --> 45:43.400]  And all of us in horticulture look really pretty bad
[45:43.400 --> 45:47.240]  when we do calories because we got pomology, which
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.840]  apples and oranges and agronomy.
[45:51.840 --> 45:55.800]  The favorite motto in agronomy is agronomy feeds the world.
[45:55.840 --> 45:59.640]  Yeah, well, horticulture makes the world healthy.
[45:59.640 --> 46:04.320]  But none of this looks very good for calories.
[46:04.320 --> 46:08.640]  You have to have, wheat and rice are the two staple crops
[46:08.640 --> 46:09.920]  in the world.
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.040]  They're similar in terms of human consumption.
[46:14.040 --> 46:17.560]  And oh my, I think something like 80% of the world calories
[46:17.560 --> 46:19.880]  comes from either wheat or rice.
[46:19.880 --> 46:23.840]  So those are, you got to do those to feed the world.
[46:23.840 --> 46:28.000]  Corn and soybeans are fed to pigs almost always,
[46:28.000 --> 46:33.200]  at least now in the commercial approach.
[46:33.200 --> 46:34.240]  Yes?
[46:34.240 --> 46:37.480]  So I noticed that you were focusing a lot on solar energy.
[46:37.480 --> 46:40.440]  I was wondering if you did any calculations with wind energy
[46:40.440 --> 46:41.840]  if you were serving.
[46:41.840 --> 46:44.680]  I have not.
[46:44.680 --> 46:46.520]  But we could.
[46:46.520 --> 46:48.160]  I'm sorry, what was the question again?
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.840]  Oh, could we do this with wind energy?
[46:52.840 --> 46:57.120]  And it's similar challenges.
[46:57.120 --> 46:59.080]  Wind energy is so localized.
[46:59.080 --> 47:01.360]  When you fly across the country and you
[47:01.360 --> 47:04.880]  can see a bunch of windmills and nothing.
[47:04.880 --> 47:08.080]  Wind energy is more challenging than solar
[47:08.080 --> 47:10.920]  because it's so non-uniformly distributed.
[47:10.920 --> 47:13.880]  A few places with high wind, and we're
[47:13.880 --> 47:18.280]  working hard to mine those places, where solar is.
[47:18.280 --> 47:20.440]  What's the number?
[47:20.480 --> 47:24.360]  More solar energy falls on the planet in an hour
[47:24.360 --> 47:27.400]  than the whole population uses in a year.
[47:27.400 --> 47:30.760]  I mean, we have abundant solar energy.
[47:30.760 --> 47:34.320]  We just got to figure out how to use it.
[47:34.320 --> 47:36.160]  So the reason I didn't do wind is
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.720]  because it's less available and generally less favorable
[47:40.720 --> 47:42.240]  economics.
[47:42.240 --> 47:45.480]  But in the places with high wind, then it works.
[47:45.480 --> 47:48.480]  Yes?
[47:48.480 --> 47:49.000]  Neil?
[47:49.320 --> 47:50.480]  Question along those lines.
[47:50.480 --> 47:52.440]  So I'll push it a little bit further.
[47:52.440 --> 47:55.120]  What about nuclear or then nuclear fusion?
[47:55.120 --> 47:56.200]  Sure.
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.280]  And if we could get nuclear fusion, wow.
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.400]  Now this whole thing makes sense immediately.
[48:03.400 --> 48:06.200]  But if we got nuclear fusion, all kinds of things
[48:06.200 --> 48:06.800]  would change.
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.760]  Gas-powered cars would become old-fashioned overnight.
[48:14.760 --> 48:17.080]  So that depends.
[48:17.120 --> 48:19.960]  So when you think about big picture energy,
[48:19.960 --> 48:22.520]  depends on how we can get electricity.
[48:27.800 --> 48:30.880]  So what exactly are the benefits outside of reduced labor
[48:30.880 --> 48:32.480]  costs of automation?
[48:32.480 --> 48:35.960]  Are there benefits other than economic reasons
[48:35.960 --> 48:38.080]  for reduced labor costs?
[48:38.080 --> 48:40.000]  Can you repeat that?
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.800]  Are there benefits other than reduced labor?
[48:42.800 --> 48:43.320]  Right.
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.160]  So you said like improved automation
[48:47.160 --> 48:49.040]  is like a main benefit?
[48:49.040 --> 48:49.560]  No.
[48:49.560 --> 48:53.280]  High-quality food is a huge benefit.
[48:53.280 --> 48:54.360]  Very fresh.
[48:54.360 --> 48:57.360]  Honestly, I think we would get people
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.280]  eating more vegetables if they were high enough quality.
[49:02.280 --> 49:04.000]  But right now, you go to the store,
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.200]  and only the wealthy people can afford those.
[49:06.200 --> 49:07.800]  And the people that need them the most
[49:07.800 --> 49:10.320]  are the underserved people.
[49:10.320 --> 49:12.040]  And we're not going to get to those people
[49:12.040 --> 49:17.920]  when it's $4 per pound of lettuce or tomatoes.
[49:17.920 --> 49:22.840]  They're buying the cheapest stuff they can get.
[49:22.840 --> 49:30.240]  But that's a huge benefit to higher-quality produce.
[49:30.240 --> 49:32.840]  But one thing I'm interested in is
[49:32.840 --> 49:35.480]  like you said, increased automation, right?
[49:35.480 --> 49:37.240]  That was the last slide.
[49:37.240 --> 49:40.160]  Is there like that is like a benefit
[49:40.160 --> 49:42.200]  because it reduces the labor costs?
[49:42.200 --> 49:44.640]  But is there any other benefits?
[49:44.640 --> 49:47.680]  Well, yes.
[49:47.680 --> 49:49.640]  As I mentioned, savings of water.
[49:49.640 --> 49:51.120]  That's for sure.
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.400]  We can also say savings of fertilizer.
[49:54.400 --> 49:58.080]  Because if we do it right, we can recycle the fertilizer too.
[49:58.080 --> 50:00.360]  It doesn't go into the groundwater.
[50:00.360 --> 50:03.120]  We're going to run out of phosphorus at some point.
[50:03.120 --> 50:08.400]  And so a system like this can be more fertilizer efficient
[50:08.400 --> 50:10.240]  because it's very controlled.
[50:10.240 --> 50:12.000]  Yeah.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.480]  And sensing into a data acquisition
[50:14.480 --> 50:20.120]  and managing the system at a later time with automation.
[50:20.120 --> 50:20.920]  Yes.
[50:20.920 --> 50:21.400]  Yes.
[50:21.400 --> 50:24.320]  It lends itself to a lot of technology.
[50:24.320 --> 50:27.320]  I mean, I'm super excited about it
[50:27.320 --> 50:29.880]  because that's what we do, controlled environment
[50:29.880 --> 50:34.160]  agriculture, high input, high output.
[50:34.160 --> 50:36.280]  But I guess the point is it's got farther
[50:36.280 --> 50:42.320]  to go than most people like to admit for lower value crops.
[50:44.920 --> 50:46.880]  OK, well, let's thank Dr. Buckley.
[50:46.880 --> 50:57.890]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[50:57.890 --> 51:01.170]  on the web at cornell.edu.
