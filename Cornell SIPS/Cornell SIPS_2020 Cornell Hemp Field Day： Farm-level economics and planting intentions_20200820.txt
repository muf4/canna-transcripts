[00:01.980 --> 00:06.860]  Good morning, my name is John Hanchar. I am with Cornell University and a member
[00:06.860 --> 00:10.900]  of the Cornell University hemp group that is stunning hemp production in New
[00:10.900 --> 00:15.740]  York State. Lindsay Paschow and Mary Ulrich, also with Cornell University, and
[00:15.740 --> 00:19.940]  I have been doing research and extension work on the economic aspects of growing
[00:19.940 --> 00:29.480]  hemp in New York. Lindsay, Mary, and I will be presenting update type
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.940]  information from an economics perspective. Based upon our cost of
[00:33.940 --> 00:38.580]  production work, I will describe the economic environment, the market signals,
[00:38.580 --> 00:42.820]  which growers considered earlier in the year regarding planting decisions.
[00:42.820 --> 00:46.940]  Lindsay will then provide update information for processing, retail, and
[00:46.940 --> 00:52.220]  consumer activities. Mary will discuss what do growers need to be thinking of
[00:52.220 --> 01:01.890]  to obtain viable hemp enterprises. Cost of production and expected prices are
[01:01.890 --> 01:06.930]  key determinants of growers planting decisions. Should I produce or not?
[01:06.930 --> 01:11.290]  If production makes sense, then how much should I plan to supply at expected
[01:11.290 --> 01:20.610]  prices? Acreage and production input decisions are involved. Item 1. Figure 1
[01:20.610 --> 01:25.450]  contains information produced by Cornell University and others. For Cornell
[01:25.450 --> 01:37.390]  University resources, please see hemp.cals.cornell.edu. Cornell analysis for a
[01:37.390 --> 01:42.510]  plastic culture system suggests variable costs and total costs equal twelve
[01:42.510 --> 01:47.430]  thousand six hundred and thirteen thousand one hundred dollars per acre,
[01:47.430 --> 01:52.830]  respectively. The Cornell work excludes a charge for the value of management
[01:52.830 --> 01:58.150]  inputs required and reflects pre-planting inputs, tasked to the point
[01:58.150 --> 02:03.630]  where dry material is in totes ready for immediate delivery or ready for storage
[02:03.630 --> 02:13.880]  and future delivery. Item 2. The other studies use similar cost of production
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.840]  methods, but the items included in time periods considered different. For example,
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.560]  the University of Connecticut values include a charge for management
[02:24.560 --> 02:32.200]  inputs required, various marketing expenses, and others. Variable costs for
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.680]  the five study range from eight thousand eight hundred dollars to thirteen
[02:36.680 --> 02:41.680]  thousand four hundred dollars per acre. The five study average was twelve
[02:41.680 --> 02:47.880]  thousand two hundred dollars per acre for the variable cost measure. Total
[02:47.880 --> 02:52.520]  costs ranged from nine thousand two hundred dollars to nineteen thousand
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.880]  three hundred dollars per acre. The five study average was fourteen thousand
[02:58.880 --> 03:06.960]  dollars per acre. Item 3. Calculated break-even prices, the expected prices
[03:06.960 --> 03:11.600]  received that would cover variable and total costs using the five study
[03:11.600 --> 03:17.240]  averages, equaled one point three one and one point five one dollars per
[03:17.240 --> 03:24.320]  percent CBD per pound of dry matter, respectively. Given percent CBD equals
[03:24.320 --> 03:31.080]  six, dry matter per plant equal one pound, and harvested plants per acre equaled
[03:31.080 --> 03:39.640]  one thousand five hundred fifty plants. Expected prices for the 2020 growing and
[03:39.640 --> 03:48.400]  harvest year, late 2019 of about a dollar and early 2020 about 65 cents
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.840]  relative to cost, suggest a relatively unfavorable economic environment for
[03:53.840 --> 04:06.220]  hemp CBD. Item 4. In summary, there are three aspects that this information
[04:06.220 --> 04:12.180]  supports. An unfavorable economic environment, unfavorable market signals
[04:12.180 --> 04:17.460]  was being considered by growers as they made planting decisions early in the
[04:17.460 --> 04:22.660]  year, especially when compared to expectations for alternative horticulture
[04:22.660 --> 04:32.220]  crops. Risks and uncertainties still concern growers. A comment by Mary Ulrich
[04:32.220 --> 04:37.220]  CCE Eastern New York Horticulture Program during a recent Cornell
[04:37.220 --> 04:44.020]  University hemp check-in call summarizes the environment quite well. Activity, that
[04:44.020 --> 04:53.890]  is hemp production, is a fraction of what it was last year in the area. If you have
[04:53.890 --> 05:01.930]  questions or comments you can contact me John Hanchar at jjh6 at cornell.edu.
[05:01.930 --> 05:05.130]  Thank you.
