[00:00.000 --> 00:08.260]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.260 --> 00:11.140]  So I am Chris Smart.
[00:11.140 --> 00:12.380]  I'm a plant pathologist.
[00:12.380 --> 00:15.220]  I study diseases of plants, mostly vegetables,
[00:15.220 --> 00:18.500]  but we also have several projects on hemp.
[00:18.500 --> 00:21.260]  My student Patrick and I talked this morning
[00:21.260 --> 00:24.300]  about root rot diseases in hemp.
[00:24.300 --> 00:28.260]  And this afternoon, my student Allie Calla,
[00:28.260 --> 00:31.740]  who just completed her PhD.
[00:31.740 --> 00:32.240]  Woo!
[00:32.600 --> 00:33.080]  Yay, Allie.
[00:33.080 --> 00:33.580]  Yay!
[00:36.360 --> 00:40.120]  She got her PhD studying hemp powdery mildew.
[00:40.120 --> 00:44.760]  And Allie is going to tell us a bit about her work,
[00:44.760 --> 00:48.680]  including on the host range of the hemp powdery mildew,
[00:48.680 --> 00:54.640]  and also about the impact of fungicides and diseases
[00:54.640 --> 00:57.040]  on cannabinoid content in hemp.
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.160]  So, Allie.
[00:58.160 --> 00:59.640]  Cool.
[00:59.640 --> 01:01.400]  Hi, everybody.
[01:01.400 --> 01:03.240]  Good afternoon.
[01:03.240 --> 01:06.480]  So like Chris was saying, my dissertation research
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.160]  has focused mostly on powdery mildew on hemp.
[01:11.160 --> 01:16.000]  Powdery mildew on hemp is caused by a fungal pathogen called
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.480]  Golovina myces ambrosiae.
[01:19.480 --> 01:22.360]  And if you know anything about powdery mildews,
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.040]  there are lots and lots of different species
[01:26.040 --> 01:29.060]  of powdery mildews that affect different crops.
[01:29.060 --> 01:32.180]  And they tend to be very host specific, which just means
[01:32.180 --> 01:35.900]  that a single powdery mildew tends to only infect
[01:35.900 --> 01:38.460]  a single host or closely related hosts.
[01:41.220 --> 01:43.220]  But we have actually found something
[01:43.220 --> 01:46.260]  contradictory to that in hemp powdery mildew.
[01:46.260 --> 01:48.740]  We first identified hemp powdery mildew here
[01:48.740 --> 01:51.760]  in New York state in 2019.
[01:51.760 --> 01:54.100]  And that's when I began working on this project
[01:54.100 --> 01:56.900]  and was looking through the literature
[01:56.900 --> 02:01.540]  just to find out more about this pathogen
[02:01.540 --> 02:03.380]  and see what was already out there.
[02:03.380 --> 02:07.180]  And I actually found there wasn't a lot of literature,
[02:07.180 --> 02:10.460]  but we did find that this particular species
[02:10.460 --> 02:12.780]  was being reported on a variety of different crops.
[02:12.780 --> 02:16.380]  So that was interesting and a little bit confusing,
[02:16.380 --> 02:17.860]  because like I said, powdery mildews
[02:17.860 --> 02:20.540]  tend to have a very specific host range.
[02:20.540 --> 02:25.820]  So I started doing some growth chamber experiments in 2020
[02:25.820 --> 02:27.340]  just taking powdery mildew that we
[02:27.340 --> 02:31.220]  had gotten from hemp samples in the field
[02:31.220 --> 02:33.740]  and using that powdery mildew to inoculate
[02:33.740 --> 02:35.140]  a variety of different crops.
[02:35.140 --> 02:40.700]  So we inoculated sunflower, a few cucurbits, and okra
[02:40.700 --> 02:42.260]  to begin with.
[02:42.260 --> 02:44.580]  And we found that the powdery was
[02:44.580 --> 02:48.540]  able to infect some of the cucurbits,
[02:48.540 --> 02:55.260]  particularly cucurbita pepo, the sunflower, and the okra.
[02:55.260 --> 03:00.940]  So Chris is walking around with some leaf samples
[03:00.940 --> 03:02.860]  of some of those crops that we're
[03:02.860 --> 03:05.860]  seeing this powdery mildew on.
[03:05.860 --> 03:08.660]  We also did a field trial last year
[03:08.660 --> 03:15.300]  where we expanded the host species that we were screening.
[03:15.300 --> 03:24.300]  So we screened a variety of cucurbita pepo varieties,
[03:24.300 --> 03:29.620]  a few different sunflower cultivars, okra cultivars,
[03:29.620 --> 03:32.420]  and zinnia cultivars, all of which
[03:32.420 --> 03:36.580]  were susceptible to this powdery mildew species.
[03:36.580 --> 03:39.100]  But one thing we did find in the field
[03:39.100 --> 03:45.140]  was that all the cucurbita pepo varieties that we screened,
[03:45.140 --> 03:48.660]  while we saw that they were susceptible in the growth
[03:48.660 --> 03:52.380]  chamber experiments, we saw in the field
[03:52.380 --> 03:54.460]  they became very infected.
[03:54.460 --> 03:59.260]  And when we sequenced those samples to identify them,
[03:59.260 --> 04:04.180]  we found a different powdery mildew species
[04:04.180 --> 04:06.260]  on the cucurbits.
[04:06.260 --> 04:09.140]  So the species we found was Phytosporus anthii.
[04:09.140 --> 04:12.680]  And this is another powdery mildew species
[04:12.680 --> 04:16.660]  that is the main causal agent of cucurbit powdery mildew.
[04:16.660 --> 04:18.100]  So what we think is happening there
[04:18.100 --> 04:21.980]  is that the cucurbits are susceptible to this hemp
[04:21.980 --> 04:25.180]  powdery mildew, but the Pedocera species
[04:25.180 --> 04:29.140]  is out competing in the field when they're both present.
[04:31.820 --> 04:34.580]  So this was just something to maybe keep in mind
[04:34.580 --> 04:38.620]  when you're out planting, being mindful of other crops
[04:38.620 --> 04:40.620]  that you're planting nearby, or maybe
[04:40.620 --> 04:43.100]  in a controlled environment like something
[04:43.100 --> 04:44.860]  like this or a greenhouse.
[04:44.860 --> 04:48.380]  Just being mindful of the crop species
[04:48.380 --> 04:51.660]  that you're planting nearby if you're
[04:51.660 --> 04:54.580]  trying to control for powdery mildew.
[04:54.580 --> 04:57.340]  So the other project that Chris mentioned
[04:57.340 --> 05:01.060]  was our fungicide efficacy trials.
[05:01.060 --> 05:05.620]  I've done two years of trials now.
[05:05.620 --> 05:08.340]  Last year, I presented some data on that showing
[05:08.340 --> 05:13.540]  we found a few products that are labeled for hemp in New York
[05:13.540 --> 05:16.980]  that were effective at reducing powdery mildew disease
[05:16.980 --> 05:18.220]  severity.
[05:18.220 --> 05:22.220]  And then we repeated that trial last year.
[05:22.220 --> 05:26.940]  So now we have two years of data to show that those products were
[05:26.940 --> 05:29.220]  effective.
[05:29.220 --> 05:34.260]  One of them is the Sill Matrix, which is a potassium silicate
[05:34.260 --> 05:37.540]  and I believe is also part of this trial.
[05:37.540 --> 05:39.940]  So Savannah will talk a bit about that in a bit.
[05:39.940 --> 05:43.540]  And then the other product we found that was successful
[05:43.540 --> 05:46.580]  in reducing powdery mildew was double nickel,
[05:46.580 --> 05:52.940]  which is a bacillus species biocontrol product.
[05:52.940 --> 05:57.740]  We also tested in those trials whether both the pathogen
[05:57.740 --> 06:00.740]  infection, so powdery mildew infection,
[06:00.740 --> 06:05.740]  and fungicide treatment, we tested
[06:05.740 --> 06:08.380]  to see whether those would affect cannabinoid production.
[06:08.380 --> 06:15.500]  So we tested these on a high cannabinoid and high cannabidiol
[06:15.500 --> 06:18.620]  and high CBG cultivars.
[06:18.620 --> 06:23.180]  And we tested all of the main cannabinoids
[06:23.180 --> 06:24.220]  at the end of the season.
[06:24.220 --> 06:26.980]  And we found that neither pathogen infection
[06:26.980 --> 06:32.060]  or the fungicide treatment impacted cannabinoid production
[06:32.060 --> 06:35.700]  in both years and both different cultivars.
[06:35.700 --> 06:36.740]  So yeah.
[06:36.740 --> 06:39.140]  Do you want to add anything, Chris?
[06:39.140 --> 06:44.980]  Yeah, so I will also say that powdery mildew here at Cornell,
[06:44.980 --> 06:48.780]  powdery mildew is the pathogen that we are furthest
[06:48.780 --> 06:52.420]  along in breeding for resistance.
[06:52.420 --> 06:57.620]  Allie actually did a screen, did all the reading of a screen,
[06:57.620 --> 07:03.020]  a large number of cultivars of hemp.
[07:03.020 --> 07:07.580]  And we have identified several different genes
[07:07.580 --> 07:12.260]  that are responsible for susceptibility or resistance
[07:12.260 --> 07:14.220]  to powdery mildew in hemp.
[07:14.300 --> 07:17.420]  And we're working with the breeding program
[07:17.420 --> 07:22.180]  to get those incorporated into the hemp cultivars
[07:22.180 --> 07:23.500]  that they release.
[07:23.500 --> 07:24.780]  And so we're really excited.
[07:24.780 --> 07:27.900]  One of the genes that we identified
[07:27.900 --> 07:31.100]  is actually a susceptibility gene.
[07:31.100 --> 07:33.940]  So when that protein is in the plant,
[07:33.940 --> 07:37.300]  the plant is susceptible to powdery mildew.
[07:37.300 --> 07:42.660]  But in the cultivar that we identified that was resistant,
[07:42.660 --> 07:45.540]  it was really completely resistant.
[07:45.540 --> 07:48.940]  And that gene had a natural mutation in it.
[07:48.940 --> 07:51.180]  The plant grew fine.
[07:51.180 --> 07:54.180]  So far, we haven't seen any impacts on yield.
[07:54.180 --> 07:58.140]  But that natural mutation was preventing powdery mildew
[07:58.140 --> 07:59.620]  from attacking the plant.
[07:59.620 --> 08:03.500]  So this would be optimal if we could
[08:03.500 --> 08:05.100]  use through the breeding program,
[08:05.100 --> 08:08.300]  breed that into a larger number of cultivars.
[08:08.300 --> 08:12.700]  So we're really excited about the powdery mildew work
[08:12.700 --> 08:18.140]  at both the control, the fungicide control strategies,
[08:18.140 --> 08:19.980]  as well as resistance strategies.
[08:19.980 --> 08:23.700]  And I think what it will take to control powdery mildew
[08:23.700 --> 08:26.260]  is going to be an integrated approach
[08:26.260 --> 08:32.420]  of resistant cultivars, lots of airflow, like you see here,
[08:32.420 --> 08:35.980]  along with potentially some of the biofungicides
[08:35.980 --> 08:37.780]  that Ali found to be effective.
[08:37.780 --> 08:39.100]  So questions for Ali?
[08:42.620 --> 08:43.380]  No questions.
[08:43.380 --> 08:45.060]  Wow.
[08:45.060 --> 08:49.940]  Do any of the products affect the testing, like lip testing,
[08:49.940 --> 08:53.060]  or the residues, or powder?
[08:53.060 --> 08:58.100]  So the question is, do any of the products affect testing?
[08:58.100 --> 09:02.700]  So that's something that is an area
[09:02.700 --> 09:04.900]  that we would like to look more into,
[09:04.900 --> 09:08.060]  specifically testing for microbial,
[09:08.060 --> 09:11.500]  since they are biocontrol products.
[09:11.500 --> 09:13.340]  So that's not something we've looked at yet,
[09:13.340 --> 09:18.260]  but it's something that would be a future thing
[09:18.260 --> 09:20.220]  we want to look at.
[09:20.220 --> 09:24.020]  Yeah, a lot of growers will stop spraying bacillus products
[09:24.020 --> 09:29.540]  two weeks prior to harvest, because if the microbial
[09:29.540 --> 09:34.300]  testing that happens is just a total number of colony forming
[09:34.300 --> 09:37.780]  units that you might get back on a quality report,
[09:37.780 --> 09:40.420]  bacillus will come up as a colony forming unit.
[09:40.420 --> 09:43.580]  It will grow on the media that it's plated on.
[09:43.580 --> 09:45.780]  So as Ali said, that's one of the things
[09:45.780 --> 09:49.940]  we want to work with the folks that
[09:49.940 --> 09:53.580]  are making the regulations to make sure that everyone knows
[09:53.580 --> 09:56.900]  exactly what microbials are being tested for.
[09:56.900 --> 09:59.620]  And if bacillus is being tested for,
[09:59.620 --> 10:01.900]  then when do we actually need to stop spraying
[10:01.900 --> 10:04.100]  that biological, which is controlling the pathogen,
[10:04.900 --> 10:06.700]  to make sure that you don't get red flagged
[10:06.700 --> 10:09.700]  in the microbial testing?
[10:09.700 --> 10:12.340]  The products that we tested do not
[10:12.340 --> 10:14.740]  increase heavy metal or anything else.
[10:14.740 --> 10:16.140]  It would just be the microbials.
[10:21.060 --> 10:22.300]  All right.
[10:22.300 --> 10:23.420]  Cool.
[10:23.420 --> 10:24.460]  Ali, nice job.
[10:24.460 --> 10:28.540]  Thank you, Ali.
