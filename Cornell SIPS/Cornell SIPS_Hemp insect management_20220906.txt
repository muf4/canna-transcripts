[00:00.000 --> 00:07.720]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.720 --> 00:08.880]  I'm going to start.
[00:08.880 --> 00:10.040]  So my name's Marion Zuflaite.
[00:10.040 --> 00:11.740]  I'm with the New York State IPM program.
[00:11.740 --> 00:15.160]  I work with vegetables, including hemp.
[00:15.160 --> 00:18.920]  The last two years, I've been doing a pest survey in hemp,
[00:18.920 --> 00:21.580]  both insects as well as diseases.
[00:21.580 --> 00:24.280]  And we're going to present some of the main insect pests
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.680]  that we have found.
[00:25.680 --> 00:27.920]  And then Heather's going to introduce herself.
[00:27.920 --> 00:29.840]  And then we're going to kind of tag team this.
[00:29.840 --> 00:33.040]  So we're going to pass the mic back and forth.
[00:33.040 --> 00:33.840]  Thanks, Marion.
[00:33.840 --> 00:36.120]  As Chris said, I'm Heather Grab.
[00:36.120 --> 00:39.120]  I'm in the School of Integrative Plant Sciences.
[00:39.120 --> 00:41.560]  Marion's sampling work has focused a lot.
[00:41.560 --> 00:43.240]  I'm sure many of your farms she's
[00:43.240 --> 00:46.400]  been out to visit for cannabinoid sampling.
[00:46.400 --> 00:48.400]  A lot of my sampling has focused more
[00:48.400 --> 00:51.840]  on the industrial side of hemp, so thinking more
[00:51.840 --> 00:55.000]  about the grain and fiber market classes.
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.040]  We do have also a handout today.
[00:57.040 --> 00:59.200]  We're going to walk through some of these pests
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.160]  and the kinds of damage that we're seeing with those.
[01:02.160 --> 01:04.640]  I would encourage you to migrate over to the table.
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.240]  We have a QR code posted there that you can scan that will
[01:07.240 --> 01:09.840]  take you directly to this sheet.
[01:09.840 --> 01:13.360]  But we are also going to shorten up our talk a little bit today.
[01:13.360 --> 01:15.280]  So we'll only speak for about 10 minutes
[01:15.280 --> 01:18.760]  before we pass it over to Judson Reed, who's
[01:18.760 --> 01:21.320]  going to talk a little bit about soils and high tunnels.
[01:21.320 --> 01:22.780]  And then we'll have an opportunity,
[01:22.780 --> 01:24.600]  as we love to do with these field days,
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.040]  for you to get out and walk through the plants.
[01:28.040 --> 01:31.240]  And we will work with you to help identify
[01:31.240 --> 01:33.400]  some of these pests and disease issues
[01:33.400 --> 01:35.480]  that we are seeing in the high tunnel
[01:35.480 --> 01:39.120]  here, as well as over in the grow dome today.
[01:39.120 --> 01:42.120]  So relative to what we've heard about already today
[01:42.120 --> 01:45.600]  in terms of weeds and diseases, there's
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.120]  pretty good news on the entomological front.
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.560]  So we see a wide diversity of different insects
[01:52.560 --> 01:54.320]  showing up in hemp.
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.640]  But for the most part, they're all of relatively low concern.
[01:59.640 --> 02:02.080]  Many of these are insect pests that we're
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.080]  familiar with in other cropping systems, which
[02:05.080 --> 02:08.840]  is important to think about when we're managing diverse farms
[02:08.840 --> 02:13.240]  or thinking about crops that are grown after or adjacent to hemp
[02:13.240 --> 02:14.120]  sites.
[02:14.120 --> 02:16.960]  So a lot of the pests that we're going to think about today
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.080]  here are ones that you would be familiar with
[02:19.080 --> 02:23.720]  from other crops, like tarnished plant bugs or Japanese beetles.
[02:23.720 --> 02:26.520]  Many pests of corn are also showing up
[02:26.520 --> 02:28.520]  in hemp very regularly.
[02:28.520 --> 02:33.120]  However, we don't tend to see very high levels of damage.
[02:33.120 --> 02:35.200]  Another really important consideration
[02:35.200 --> 02:36.960]  as the other talks highlighted today
[02:36.960 --> 02:39.400]  is that there are very few products that
[02:39.400 --> 02:42.680]  are registered as treatment options for pests.
[02:42.680 --> 02:44.040]  That's not unique.
[02:44.040 --> 02:46.160]  That's the case with weeds also.
[02:46.160 --> 02:49.440]  So of course, scouting and preventative management
[02:49.440 --> 02:52.440]  with biologicals is very important.
[02:52.440 --> 02:55.240]  We see big differences in pest pressure
[02:55.240 --> 02:57.160]  across different market classes.
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.000]  So hemp that is grown for grain and fiber
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.440]  versus hemp that's grown for cannabinoids,
[03:03.440 --> 03:06.680]  and especially in different growing environments, some
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.560]  of which you'll see today between our field trials
[03:09.560 --> 03:12.200]  that we'll visit later this afternoon,
[03:12.200 --> 03:13.640]  the high tunnels here.
[03:13.640 --> 03:14.960]  And then in the grow dome, you'll
[03:14.960 --> 03:18.240]  see different levels of pest pressure, which are often
[03:18.240 --> 03:21.600]  higher in protected culture environments,
[03:21.600 --> 03:24.640]  like greenhouses, where environmental conditions can
[03:24.640 --> 03:28.120]  be more optimal for rapid growth of pests
[03:28.120 --> 03:30.560]  like aphids, spider mites, and thrips.
[03:30.560 --> 03:32.400]  And Justin will talk a little bit more
[03:32.400 --> 03:35.280]  at his talk this afternoon about some biological control
[03:35.280 --> 03:38.680]  strategies that you might think about for those pests.
[03:38.680 --> 03:41.840]  So I'm going to start off with talking about just a few
[03:41.840 --> 03:44.960]  of the pests that are on the, oh, actually, sorry.
[03:44.960 --> 03:47.440]  We're going to talk first really briefly about scouting.
[03:47.440 --> 03:49.160]  So I'm going to pass it over to Marion
[03:49.160 --> 03:52.640]  to key you in on some best practices for scouting
[03:52.640 --> 03:55.120]  your crops.
[03:55.120 --> 03:56.000]  I just hit something.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.760]  Hopefully, it's still on.
[03:57.760 --> 04:01.080]  So I want to briefly talk about scouting.
[04:01.080 --> 04:02.800]  If you're out there looking at your hemp,
[04:02.800 --> 04:05.800]  ideally, you're going to go out there at least once a week.
[04:05.800 --> 04:08.040]  When you're out there doing other things in your hemp,
[04:08.040 --> 04:09.560]  you're out there anyway.
[04:09.560 --> 04:13.240]  But what we do is usually go out and scout weekly.
[04:13.240 --> 04:15.840]  And you want to go through all your fields,
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.240]  all your different plantings, looking for any insect or
[04:19.240 --> 04:20.760]  disease pests.
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.840]  You want to look at the plants.
[04:22.840 --> 04:24.520]  Select 10 random spots.
[04:24.520 --> 04:26.160]  That's usually our recommendation.
[04:26.160 --> 04:27.400]  Look at the entire plant.
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.320]  Look at the flower.
[04:28.320 --> 04:30.200]  Look at the leaves, the upper surface,
[04:30.200 --> 04:31.560]  the lower surface of the leaf.
[04:31.560 --> 04:33.760]  There might be insects underneath.
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.120]  Usually, if you just walk by, you
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.840]  might not see spider mites starting on the lower part
[04:38.840 --> 04:39.840]  of the plant underneath.
[04:39.840 --> 04:42.680]  So you really want to make sure you look at the entire plant.
[04:42.680 --> 04:43.600]  Look at the stem.
[04:43.600 --> 04:46.320]  There might be boring insects that are getting into the stem.
[04:46.320 --> 04:48.080]  If the plant isn't looking the healthiest,
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.600]  you might even want to look down into the roots.
[04:51.440 --> 04:54.640]  That's a really quick way to scout.
[04:54.640 --> 04:58.160]  But go out there frequently and look at the entire plant.
[05:00.440 --> 05:02.960]  All right, so what should you be looking for?
[05:02.960 --> 05:06.920]  Oftentimes, you will see the insects more frequently
[05:06.920 --> 05:07.880]  than the damage.
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.280]  So I'm going to walk through some of the ones
[05:09.280 --> 05:12.980]  that we're seeing frequently here.
[05:12.980 --> 05:15.660]  One that came up really frequently this season
[05:15.660 --> 05:19.540]  with the hot, dry weather is four-lined plant bug.
[05:19.540 --> 05:23.460]  So that is a characteristic yellow, green, and black
[05:23.460 --> 05:28.420]  striped insect that causes piercing, thank you, Chris,
[05:28.420 --> 05:30.700]  that causes piercing, sucking damage on the leaves.
[05:30.700 --> 05:32.660]  And so Marion's walking around with an example
[05:32.660 --> 05:35.700]  of that really characteristic feeding damage that's
[05:35.700 --> 05:38.860]  associated with this pest.
[05:38.860 --> 05:41.460]  Fortunately, populations of this pest
[05:41.460 --> 05:44.660]  tend to decline really dramatically around June.
[05:44.660 --> 05:46.660]  So we're most concerned about this pest
[05:46.700 --> 05:50.420]  during hot, dry seasons, and especially early in the season
[05:50.420 --> 05:52.620]  during the establishment.
[05:52.620 --> 05:55.900]  The next pest on our list is a relatively widespread,
[05:55.900 --> 05:59.060]  very broad host range, the tarnished plant bug.
[05:59.060 --> 06:01.380]  So another true bug pest.
[06:01.380 --> 06:04.020]  It's feeding on developing plant tissue,
[06:04.020 --> 06:07.580]  particularly on the developing leaves
[06:07.580 --> 06:09.620]  and the developing flower tissue.
[06:09.620 --> 06:11.820]  So I've seen a lot more of this also
[06:11.820 --> 06:13.620]  with the dry weather this year.
[06:13.660 --> 06:18.260]  It causes a sort of Swiss cheese type of feeding on the leaves.
[06:18.260 --> 06:21.220]  And Marion actually has some real plant samples
[06:21.220 --> 06:25.180]  that she's going to pass around of what this damage looks like.
[06:25.180 --> 06:27.020]  So because the damage is happening
[06:27.020 --> 06:29.500]  as those leaves are developing and expanding,
[06:29.500 --> 06:32.620]  you won't see the plant bug feeding on the leaves itself.
[06:32.620 --> 06:35.020]  You'll see the evidence of that damage showing up
[06:35.020 --> 06:37.620]  after those leaves have fully expanded.
[06:37.620 --> 06:39.860]  This is also a pest that is going
[06:39.860 --> 06:42.580]  to be feeding on developing flower tissue
[06:42.580 --> 06:45.860]  and potentially maybe also causing some impacts
[06:45.860 --> 06:47.580]  in grain production systems
[06:47.580 --> 06:51.020]  because it loves to feed on developing seeds.
[06:51.020 --> 06:54.420]  So those of you who are producers of veg and fruit crops
[06:54.420 --> 06:56.420]  will be familiar with this pest.
[06:56.420 --> 06:59.180]  Managing some of the weedy alternative hosts
[06:59.180 --> 07:02.540]  is a great strategy for dealing with this pest.
[07:02.540 --> 07:04.660]  The next one up is one that almost everyone
[07:04.660 --> 07:06.900]  will have seen independent of the systems
[07:06.900 --> 07:10.220]  unless you are fully in a controlled environment system,
[07:10.220 --> 07:12.220]  and that's Japanese beetles.
[07:12.260 --> 07:14.020]  They are large beetles
[07:14.020 --> 07:17.140]  that have an aggregating feeding behavior.
[07:17.140 --> 07:20.020]  The adults are feeding on the leaves.
[07:20.020 --> 07:22.740]  They'll often also be up in the flowers.
[07:22.740 --> 07:24.820]  So we get a lot of reports from growers
[07:24.820 --> 07:26.540]  who are seeing these beetles,
[07:26.540 --> 07:30.420]  but fortunately we do not tend to see high levels of damage,
[07:30.420 --> 07:34.460]  perhaps with the exception of some of our grain cultivars
[07:34.460 --> 07:38.700]  that have very low levels of cannabinoid expression,
[07:38.700 --> 07:40.500]  which speaks to the potential
[07:40.540 --> 07:43.340]  for cannabinoids, conundrum trichomes,
[07:43.340 --> 07:47.740]  to be having some action against herbivorous pests.
[07:47.740 --> 07:50.900]  George Stack, who's a PhD student working with Larry Smart,
[07:50.900 --> 07:52.300]  has some experiments going on
[07:52.300 --> 07:56.220]  looking at the relationship between pest damage levels
[07:56.220 --> 07:58.820]  and cannabinoid expression in hemp.
[07:58.820 --> 08:01.460]  And so I encourage you all to look out for his results
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.300]  that will be coming out soon.
[08:03.300 --> 08:07.500]  But overall, we're seeing relatively low concern
[08:07.500 --> 08:09.020]  in terms of Japanese beetles,
[08:09.020 --> 08:12.700]  even though they are a relatively apparent pest
[08:12.700 --> 08:15.220]  that tends to aggregate a lot.
[08:15.220 --> 08:17.140]  So our last pest that I'm gonna share with you
[08:17.140 --> 08:19.940]  before I pass it over to Marian Zupfel,
[08:19.940 --> 08:21.140]  so she's showing you right now
[08:21.140 --> 08:22.900]  some examples of Japanese beetles
[08:22.900 --> 08:26.860]  and their feeding damage that they cause on leaves,
[08:26.860 --> 08:29.380]  is the flea beetles.
[08:29.380 --> 08:30.780]  Flea beetles are another pest
[08:30.780 --> 08:34.500]  that we tend to see much more commonly in hot, dry weather
[08:34.500 --> 08:38.620]  when their alternative weedy hosts are less preferred
[08:39.220 --> 08:40.900]  or less available in the environment.
[08:40.900 --> 08:44.060]  They tend to cause sort of a shotgun style,
[08:44.060 --> 08:47.220]  irregular feeding damage on leaves.
[08:47.220 --> 08:49.740]  We're mostly seeing redheaded flea beetles
[08:49.740 --> 08:51.820]  showing up in our hemp fields.
[08:51.820 --> 08:56.340]  And again, these are a relatively low concern pest
[08:56.340 --> 09:00.220]  with the exception of early stand establishment
[09:00.220 --> 09:02.420]  where heavy levels of feeding
[09:02.420 --> 09:04.700]  could potentially cause issues.
[09:04.700 --> 09:07.380]  So all of the four pests that I shared with you just now
[09:07.380 --> 09:09.260]  are ones that you should be most concerned about
[09:09.260 --> 09:11.660]  in outdoor cultivation systems.
[09:11.660 --> 09:13.740]  I'm gonna pass it over to Marian.
[09:13.740 --> 09:15.580]  She's gonna talk about a few more pests
[09:15.580 --> 09:17.980]  that you'll find in outdoor production systems
[09:17.980 --> 09:19.340]  and then also highlight a few
[09:19.340 --> 09:21.580]  that you would see in more protected culture.
[09:26.680 --> 09:27.880]  All right, Heather's still going around
[09:27.880 --> 09:29.880]  with the redheaded flea beetle.
[09:29.880 --> 09:32.040]  I'm sorry, I should have made a lot more samples.
[09:32.040 --> 09:35.440]  It's a larger crowd than we anticipated, which is good.
[09:35.440 --> 09:37.920]  But so redheaded flea beetle adults and damage.
[09:37.920 --> 09:39.800]  Just notice the difference between
[09:39.800 --> 09:41.640]  the size of the damage to Japanese beetle,
[09:41.640 --> 09:43.320]  much larger holes.
[09:43.320 --> 09:45.480]  The redheaded flea beetle also making holes
[09:45.480 --> 09:47.360]  in the tarnished plant bug.
[09:48.400 --> 09:50.440]  Cleaner holes with more of a later
[09:53.760 --> 09:56.600]  the area surrounding the hole is a little paler in color.
[09:56.600 --> 09:59.240]  All right, I'm gonna talk about the potato leaf hopper.
[09:59.240 --> 10:00.720]  And when Heather gets back,
[10:02.560 --> 10:04.360]  she can pass around the picture.
[10:04.360 --> 10:06.760]  I think hopefully people are familiar
[10:06.800 --> 10:08.560]  with the potato leaf hopper,
[10:08.560 --> 10:11.480]  kind of a wedge-shaped lime green,
[10:11.480 --> 10:13.320]  both the nymph as well as the adult.
[10:13.320 --> 10:15.480]  They'll both be a pest in hemp.
[10:16.360 --> 10:18.960]  Usually in fields that are close to alfalfa,
[10:18.960 --> 10:21.120]  they're coming in from the alfalfa.
[10:21.120 --> 10:23.560]  They'll cause what's termed hopper burn,
[10:23.560 --> 10:26.560]  which on the image you'll see the tips of the leaf
[10:26.560 --> 10:28.060]  are starting to turn yellow.
[10:28.060 --> 10:30.880]  Eventually they will wilt and turn brown
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.000]  if you have a very severe leaf hopper population.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.240]  Some of the control measures is trying not to plant
[10:37.240 --> 10:40.400]  your hemp near a potential another crop like alfalfa
[10:40.400 --> 10:43.400]  that could serve as a host where they're coming in from.
[10:44.320 --> 10:46.920]  If red clover is a host as well.
[10:48.280 --> 10:50.600]  So the next one is two-spotted spider mite,
[10:50.600 --> 10:52.920]  which Heather's passing around.
[10:52.920 --> 10:56.240]  This is the one that we often see on the underside of leaves
[10:56.240 --> 10:58.080]  near the bottom of the plant.
[10:58.080 --> 11:00.040]  It's a mite, so it'll have eight legs.
[11:00.040 --> 11:03.360]  And two-spotted because it has those two big black spots
[11:03.360 --> 11:04.200]  on either side.
[11:04.240 --> 11:05.680]  All of them will have that.
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.760]  If they've just molted,
[11:06.760 --> 11:08.260]  they're probably not gonna look like that.
[11:08.260 --> 11:10.200]  They'll be very translucent.
[11:10.200 --> 11:11.800]  But the majority of the ones you see
[11:11.800 --> 11:12.680]  are gonna look like that.
[11:12.680 --> 11:16.040]  And the damage is very similar to thrips damage.
[11:16.040 --> 11:18.620]  She does have a picture on there for damage,
[11:18.620 --> 11:21.060]  but we also have thrips damaged leaves.
[11:21.060 --> 11:22.480]  They're extremely similar.
[11:22.480 --> 11:25.640]  I have not seen any this year in hemp,
[11:25.640 --> 11:26.840]  which kind of surprises me
[11:26.840 --> 11:29.080]  because it's been such a hot dry year,
[11:29.080 --> 11:32.360]  which usually promotes the two-spotted spider mite.
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.080]  They'll also cause webbing on the plant.
[11:34.920 --> 11:36.200]  If you get a severe enough population,
[11:36.200 --> 11:38.680]  you'll find little silk webbing,
[11:38.680 --> 11:41.520]  and they'll kind of tie some of the leaves together.
[11:41.520 --> 11:43.680]  So, and Judson's gonna talk about
[11:43.680 --> 11:45.640]  bio-control of two-spotted spider mite
[11:45.640 --> 11:47.600]  in the session later this afternoon.
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.000]  I was just told we're getting tight on time.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.400]  So this is the cannabis aphid.
[11:51.400 --> 11:53.680]  Fairly distinct, if you know aphids,
[11:53.680 --> 11:54.920]  they have like these,
[11:54.920 --> 11:57.360]  this aphid has two dark lines
[11:57.360 --> 11:59.400]  running the length of the body.
[11:59.400 --> 12:01.000]  So if you have cannabis aphid,
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.880]  that's the primary aphid that's gonna get into your hemp
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.360]  and be fairly easy to recognize.
[12:06.360 --> 12:07.480]  And since we're tight on time,
[12:07.480 --> 12:09.120]  I'm gonna quickly get into the,
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.880]  oh, I think I skipped corn borer.
[12:11.880 --> 12:13.080]  I'm sorry.
[12:13.080 --> 12:15.400]  Corn earworm, that was the one that I skipped.
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.160]  Corn earworm, as the name implies, is a pest of corn.
[12:19.160 --> 12:21.220]  So if you're planting close to corn,
[12:21.220 --> 12:24.160]  you might get corn earworm into your hemp as well.
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.360]  They lay their eggs in the flower buds or on the leaves,
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.640]  but then the larvae will hatch
[12:28.640 --> 12:30.240]  and make their way into the flower buds.
[12:30.240 --> 12:33.560]  So you'll have damage in the flower bud if we have.
[12:34.240 --> 12:36.520]  So Heather's passing out the larvae of the corn earworm
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.920]  so you can see what the larvae look like.
[12:38.920 --> 12:40.620]  One thing, we don't have any thresholds
[12:40.620 --> 12:42.640]  for corn earworm in hemp,
[12:44.640 --> 12:46.760]  but you can put traps out,
[12:46.760 --> 12:50.240]  which we use in sweet corn to monitor the population.
[12:50.240 --> 12:52.840]  So you'd put a trap out near your hemp field
[12:52.840 --> 12:55.120]  and see if you have any corn earworm present.
[12:55.120 --> 12:57.240]  If you do, you might wanna start checking your flower buds,
[12:57.240 --> 12:59.460]  see if there's any larvae getting in there.
[13:00.180 --> 13:03.740]  And if you want to see adult corn earworm,
[13:03.740 --> 13:04.580]  when Heather gets back,
[13:04.580 --> 13:07.020]  she can pass out the adult corn earworm
[13:07.020 --> 13:09.740]  so you know what you're looking for in those traps.
[13:09.740 --> 13:12.180]  And the final ones that I'm gonna quickly go over
[13:12.180 --> 13:13.900]  are the boring insects.
[13:13.900 --> 13:16.520]  We have both the European corn borer
[13:16.520 --> 13:19.020]  as well as the common stock borer.
[13:19.020 --> 13:20.340]  They lay their eggs on the hemp,
[13:20.340 --> 13:21.620]  but then they bore right into it.
[13:21.620 --> 13:24.300]  So you're not gonna see a lot of damage outside.
[13:24.300 --> 13:26.560]  What you're gonna find is an entrance hole,
[13:26.560 --> 13:27.820]  but usually what you're gonna find
[13:27.820 --> 13:32.820]  is just a broken tip or stalk of the hemp plant.
[13:33.260 --> 13:35.780]  And when you peel it back, you're gonna find the larvae.
[13:35.780 --> 13:39.100]  Probably more of a problem in some of the fiber hemp
[13:39.100 --> 13:41.260]  rather than the cannabinoid hemp,
[13:41.260 --> 13:43.500]  just because they have a thinner stalk
[13:43.500 --> 13:44.940]  and they're more likely gonna snap.
[13:44.940 --> 13:47.860]  Whereas the real thick CBD hemp
[13:47.860 --> 13:49.780]  can withstand some of that boring pressure.
[13:49.780 --> 13:52.460]  It actually sometimes causes it to branch out more.
[13:52.460 --> 13:54.980]  So some people actually don't mind
[13:54.980 --> 13:57.100]  having a borer in their CBD hemp.
[13:57.980 --> 13:59.100]  Did you pass that?
[13:59.100 --> 14:00.140]  Should we just wrap up?
[14:00.140 --> 14:01.580]  Yeah.
[14:01.580 --> 14:02.960]  I will encourage everyone,
[14:02.960 --> 14:04.940]  after you get a chance to come through
[14:04.940 --> 14:08.060]  and scout through the plants or chat with us,
[14:08.060 --> 14:10.740]  to please come up and check out any of these samples
[14:10.740 --> 14:12.940]  of different pest damage that we have.
[14:12.940 --> 14:14.740]  We also do wanna highlight
[14:14.740 --> 14:17.260]  that particularly in outdoor cultivation,
[14:17.260 --> 14:20.300]  you will see a really high abundance of beneficials,
[14:20.300 --> 14:22.300]  which we've highlighted a few of,
[14:22.300 --> 14:26.160]  lacewings as well as lady beetles.
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.520]  We do not recommend that you purchase
[14:29.520 --> 14:33.920]  and apply those in outdoor environments.
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.820]  Judd will surely talk about biocontrol solutions
[14:36.820 --> 14:38.200]  in his talk this afternoon
[14:38.200 --> 14:40.400]  that would be more appropriate for indoor cultivation,
[14:40.400 --> 14:42.480]  but there's many beneficials out there,
[14:42.480 --> 14:44.560]  including in grain and fiber cultivation,
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.040]  a really high abundance of pollinators
[14:47.040 --> 14:50.160]  that are utilizing all of the pollen
[14:50.160 --> 14:53.040]  that is produced by male hemp plants.
[14:53.280 --> 14:56.760]  Also supporting a beneficial insect population
[14:56.760 --> 14:57.800]  that we wanna be aware of
[14:57.800 --> 14:59.880]  when we're thinking about management strategies
[14:59.880 --> 15:02.960]  or broadly about biodiversity management on our farms.
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.400]  So I think we will leave it for there
[15:04.400 --> 15:07.080]  and we'll pass over to Judson Reed,
[15:07.080 --> 15:09.160]  who is coming to us from Harvest New York,
[15:09.160 --> 15:11.440]  and we'll talk about soil management.
[15:11.440 --> 15:12.280]  Thank you.
[15:12.280 --> 15:13.120]  Thank you.
[15:13.120 --> 15:13.940]  Thank you.
[15:13.940 --> 15:14.780]  Thank you.
[15:14.780 --> 15:18.100]  This has been a production of Cornell University,
[15:18.100 --> 15:20.920]  on the web at cornell.edu.
