[00:00.000 --> 00:08.880]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.880 --> 00:09.380]  Great.
[00:09.380 --> 00:10.240]  Good afternoon.
[00:10.240 --> 00:11.400]  I'm Catherine Bohr.
[00:11.400 --> 00:14.320]  I'm dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
[00:14.320 --> 00:15.760]  here at Cornell University.
[00:15.760 --> 00:19.480]  And it's truly my honor to welcome you all here
[00:19.480 --> 00:20.560]  this afternoon.
[00:20.560 --> 00:22.920]  And thank you very much for joining us
[00:22.920 --> 00:25.520]  for today's Industrial Hemp Summit.
[00:25.520 --> 00:28.780]  It's truly a pleasure for me to welcome New York State
[00:28.780 --> 00:31.200]  Department of Agriculture and Markets Commissioner Richard
[00:31.200 --> 00:33.000]  Ball, sitting here on my left.
[00:33.080 --> 00:36.200]  And Commissioner Ball has been just a real champion
[00:36.200 --> 00:39.000]  for our state's agricultural industries
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  and for the research that's so essential for keeping
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.440]  our industries competitive in today's marketplace.
[00:45.440 --> 00:49.320]  I'm also grateful to be joined this afternoon by Assemblywoman
[00:49.320 --> 00:51.960]  Donna Lupardo, also here at the front table,
[00:51.960 --> 00:55.280]  and earlier this morning, also a champion for this initiative,
[00:55.280 --> 00:58.080]  Senator Tom O'Mara was with us this morning.
[00:58.080 --> 01:02.440]  Now, today's summit is an opportunity for Cornell
[01:02.440 --> 01:05.600]  experts, for experts from other universities
[01:05.600 --> 01:08.480]  here in New York State, for industry members
[01:08.480 --> 01:10.400]  to share their knowledge and to share
[01:10.400 --> 01:14.000]  their experience on industrial hemp's potential impact
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.080]  on the economy here in New York State.
[01:17.080 --> 01:19.320]  The conversations that we are having today
[01:19.320 --> 01:22.080]  are intended to help build momentum
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.200]  around Governor Cuomo's vision for expanding industrial hemp
[01:26.240 --> 01:28.360]  production here in New York.
[01:28.360 --> 01:30.960]  And as some of you heard me say this morning,
[01:30.960 --> 01:33.120]  we do have tremendous potential here
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.920]  in New York State for the production of industrial hemp,
[01:35.920 --> 01:39.840]  which really has not been grown here for decades.
[01:39.840 --> 01:43.520]  Now, if efficiently and economically grown,
[01:43.520 --> 01:46.320]  and emphasis on that, efficiently and economically
[01:46.320 --> 01:48.720]  grown, industrial hemp could be used
[01:48.720 --> 01:52.820]  to launch a wide range of New York made goods
[01:52.820 --> 01:56.500]  that could include things like healthy hemp seed oils,
[01:56.500 --> 01:59.380]  building insulation, animal bedding,
[01:59.380 --> 02:01.380]  novel medicinal products.
[02:01.380 --> 02:05.420]  However, because hemp has not been grown commercially here
[02:05.420 --> 02:07.900]  in our state for so long, a great deal
[02:07.900 --> 02:11.260]  of research and preparation lies ahead of all of us.
[02:11.260 --> 02:14.300]  And this is where Cornell University and our SUNY
[02:14.300 --> 02:15.980]  partners come in.
[02:15.980 --> 02:18.620]  And we have roles to play here.
[02:18.620 --> 02:21.980]  For example, our plant breeders have the knowledge
[02:21.980 --> 02:24.660]  and the experience to advance hemp breeding
[02:24.660 --> 02:27.420]  and to test a range of varieties for performance
[02:27.420 --> 02:28.940]  here in our state.
[02:28.940 --> 02:32.660]  They can help determine the best growing practices for hemp
[02:32.660 --> 02:34.580]  here in New York, and where and when,
[02:34.580 --> 02:37.580]  and under what conditions it will flourish.
[02:37.580 --> 02:39.620]  Our college and our SUNY partners
[02:39.620 --> 02:43.600]  are committed to providing sustainable improvement
[02:43.600 --> 02:46.300]  in the lives of people here in New York State
[02:46.300 --> 02:48.140]  through our research, through our teaching,
[02:48.140 --> 02:50.100]  and through our outreach.
[02:50.100 --> 02:53.700]  And we're particularly pleased to work in concert specifically
[02:53.700 --> 02:56.300]  with our SUNY partners, our State University of New York
[02:56.300 --> 02:58.860]  system partners from SUNY Morrisville,
[02:58.860 --> 03:01.820]  the new School of Pharmacy at Binghamton University,
[03:01.820 --> 03:04.380]  and our Sullivan Community College as well.
[03:04.380 --> 03:07.500]  Now we are committed, we are committed,
[03:07.500 --> 03:10.820]  to exploring New York's capacity to grow industrial hemp
[03:10.820 --> 03:14.380]  profitably and to take advantage of new markets.
[03:14.380 --> 03:17.020]  And through such strategies, we can
[03:17.020 --> 03:20.580]  help facilitate rural economic agricultural development
[03:20.580 --> 03:21.780]  throughout our state.
[03:21.780 --> 03:25.060]  Today's summit really is only the beginning
[03:25.060 --> 03:27.860]  of what I hope will be a very successful venture
[03:27.860 --> 03:28.740]  for our state.
[03:28.740 --> 03:31.620]  So thank you again for joining us today
[03:31.620 --> 03:34.260]  to learn more about this emerging industry
[03:34.260 --> 03:37.220]  and how we can collectively help it grow.
[03:37.220 --> 03:39.300]  And so now for this afternoon, I would
[03:39.300 --> 03:40.980]  like to introduce our first speaker.
[03:40.980 --> 03:42.400]  And that's New York State Department
[03:42.400 --> 03:45.660]  of Agriculture and Markets Commissioner Richard Ball.
[03:45.660 --> 03:48.700]  Commissioner Ball began his career in agriculture
[03:48.700 --> 03:51.940]  as a farm worker at a vegetable farm in Rhode Island
[03:51.940 --> 03:54.860]  when he was 18 years old.
[03:54.860 --> 04:02.140]  He has been the owner and the operator of Scowherry Valley
[04:02.140 --> 04:05.140]  Farms in Scowherry, New York for the last 20 years.
[04:05.140 --> 04:07.980]  And that is a 200 acre farm that produces
[04:07.980 --> 04:11.420]  a wide range of vegetable crops and small fruits
[04:11.420 --> 04:12.780]  and greenhouse crops.
[04:12.780 --> 04:15.660]  He has held a number of very important positions
[04:15.660 --> 04:18.380]  with agriculture and community organizations,
[04:18.380 --> 04:20.980]  including the New York State Vegetable Growers Association.
[04:20.980 --> 04:22.420]  He was vice president.
[04:22.420 --> 04:25.860]  And as well with New York Farm Bureau Board of Directors,
[04:25.860 --> 04:28.860]  member of executive committee, member of audit committee,
[04:28.860 --> 04:30.860]  chairman of a labor committee.
[04:30.860 --> 04:34.660]  Now he has served as the commissioner of this New York
[04:34.660 --> 04:38.240]  State Department of Agriculture and Markets since 2014.
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.700]  And I've been truly honored to partner with him
[04:41.700 --> 04:43.340]  on critically important initiatives
[04:43.340 --> 04:46.620]  that he's launched from the newly reinvigorated Council
[04:46.620 --> 04:49.980]  on Hunger and Food Policy to the Milk Marketing Advisory
[04:49.980 --> 04:50.780]  Council.
[04:50.780 --> 04:54.100]  And we collectively strive to ensure
[04:54.100 --> 04:57.900]  that the commissioner can count on all of our SUNY schools
[04:57.900 --> 05:00.780]  to step up to the plate to assist the state
[05:00.780 --> 05:03.340]  and our agricultural communities.
[05:03.340 --> 05:12.110]  Please join me in welcoming Commissioner Richard Ball.
[05:12.110 --> 05:13.610]  That was a nice way of saying you've
[05:13.610 --> 05:16.890]  got an overdressed farmer in front of you right now.
[05:16.890 --> 05:18.610]  Thank you.
[05:18.610 --> 05:19.650]  Really great to be here.
[05:19.650 --> 05:22.290]  It's great to see the crowd has gotten kind of energized
[05:22.290 --> 05:23.170]  and a little bigger.
[05:23.170 --> 05:24.930]  There's a lot of interest in this subject.
[05:24.930 --> 05:27.410]  And thank you so much, Dean.
[05:27.410 --> 05:30.970]  We had an awesome discussion this morning.
[05:30.970 --> 05:32.570]  We had the lieutenant governor here
[05:32.570 --> 05:35.890]  and some of your elected representatives, and some of them
[05:35.890 --> 05:37.930]  still here.
[05:37.930 --> 05:40.970]  But we had a great discussion, a great summary.
[05:40.970 --> 05:43.010]  We looked at where the industry is now.
[05:43.010 --> 05:44.970]  We looked at what we've done so far.
[05:44.970 --> 05:46.650]  We looked at our potential.
[05:46.650 --> 05:48.930]  And we looked at where the opportunities for the state
[05:48.930 --> 05:51.010]  to intersect and help grow it.
[05:51.010 --> 05:54.570]  I think we're pretty much all on the same page.
[05:54.570 --> 05:57.690]  And to kind of summarize that, I won't talk anymore.
[05:57.690 --> 05:59.570]  But I would direct your attention once again
[05:59.570 --> 06:00.850]  to the screen.
[06:00.850 --> 06:02.170]  We showed a video this morning.
[06:02.170 --> 06:03.810]  We're going to show it again because we
[06:03.810 --> 06:07.490]  have a number of new people and because we like the video.
[06:07.490 --> 06:09.730]  So if you would, direct your attention to the screen.
[06:09.730 --> 06:11.330]  For thousands of years, industrial hemp
[06:11.330 --> 06:13.530]  has been a valuable and versatile crop.
[06:13.530 --> 06:15.650]  Once a top commodity on American farms,
[06:15.650 --> 06:18.810]  production was driven out by other emerging industries.
[06:18.810 --> 06:21.010]  And eventually, the federal government
[06:21.010 --> 06:24.890]  made it illegal to grow, until now.
[06:24.890 --> 06:27.890]  Recognizing its vast potential, the federal farm bill
[06:27.890 --> 06:30.370]  allowed states to launch pilot programs
[06:30.370 --> 06:32.530]  for industrial hemp research.
[06:32.530 --> 06:35.970]  And in 2015, Governor Cuomo announced a bold plan
[06:35.970 --> 06:39.450]  to put the Empire State at the forefront of the country's hemp
[06:39.450 --> 06:40.250]  revival.
[06:40.250 --> 06:41.730]  With the type of legislative action
[06:41.730 --> 06:45.810]  that Governor Cuomo has led with Albany,
[06:45.810 --> 06:47.250]  it's making a real difference.
[06:47.250 --> 06:49.130]  Partnering with SUNY Morrisville,
[06:49.130 --> 06:51.570]  JD Farms in Madison County harvested
[06:51.570 --> 06:54.970]  New York's first industrial hemp crop in decades.
[06:54.970 --> 06:57.570]  Cornell University wasn't far behind.
[06:57.570 --> 07:00.130]  It was made possible through Governor Cuomo's
[07:00.130 --> 07:02.730]  industrial hemp research pilot program,
[07:02.730 --> 07:06.650]  allowing up to 10 permits to grow and research hemp
[07:06.650 --> 07:08.610]  as an agricultural commodity.
[07:08.610 --> 07:10.330]  We studied nitrogen content in the soil.
[07:10.330 --> 07:11.770]  We studied seeding rates.
[07:11.770 --> 07:15.610]  New York is abundant in water, abundant in arable land.
[07:15.610 --> 07:17.770]  And for us, this crop made a lot of sense.
[07:17.770 --> 07:21.370]  Hemp research is now expanding across the state.
[07:21.370 --> 07:23.970]  I think hemp is not only a great opportunity
[07:23.970 --> 07:26.050]  for diversification on the ground,
[07:26.050 --> 07:28.690]  but it could lead to a lot of great job
[07:28.690 --> 07:30.570]  and manufacturing opportunities that we've
[07:30.570 --> 07:33.410]  lost to globalization.
[07:33.410 --> 07:36.610]  Hemp and marijuana may look similar, but make no mistake,
[07:36.610 --> 07:39.250]  these plants have a significant difference.
[07:39.250 --> 07:41.130]  I think the major thing for people to realize
[07:41.130 --> 07:43.370]  is that industrial hemp is not marijuana,
[07:43.370 --> 07:44.570]  even though it looks like it.
[07:44.570 --> 07:49.810]  THC is the mind-altering drug in marijuana.
[07:49.810 --> 07:53.010]  And industrial hemp has very, very low levels of that.
[07:53.010 --> 07:55.730]  Generations of innovators have pioneered new markets
[07:55.730 --> 07:59.170]  for this dynamic crop, using every part of the plant
[07:59.170 --> 08:01.450]  to drive growth in vital industries
[08:01.450 --> 08:04.730]  and boost the profitability of the agricultural sector.
[08:04.730 --> 08:08.050]  Today, the US retail market for industrial hemp
[08:08.050 --> 08:10.810]  is nearly $600 million.
[08:10.810 --> 08:13.490]  It makes a good insulation, as well as
[08:13.490 --> 08:14.770]  wallboard for buildings.
[08:14.770 --> 08:16.450]  Would be useful for automobiles.
[08:16.450 --> 08:20.530]  Press board and furniture bags and biodegradable packaging
[08:20.530 --> 08:21.170]  material.
[08:21.170 --> 08:24.130]  Soaps and shampoos, cosmetic products.
[08:24.130 --> 08:25.570]  You shell hemp seeds themselves.
[08:25.570 --> 08:27.650]  They're tasty, and they're a great superfood.
[08:27.650 --> 08:30.210]  Now, with the support of the state legislature,
[08:30.210 --> 08:33.610]  Governor Cuomo is taking the program to the next level,
[08:33.610 --> 08:37.010]  removing the cap on the number of permits for hemp research,
[08:37.010 --> 08:39.730]  supporting unprecedented exploration of the crop's
[08:39.730 --> 08:43.370]  viability, and encouraging New York's best and brightest
[08:43.370 --> 08:46.810]  to discover and rediscover hemp's potential.
[08:46.810 --> 08:50.130]  As we have more opportunity to do research,
[08:50.130 --> 08:52.690]  I think we can just make it a better crop and a more
[08:52.690 --> 08:53.730]  economical crop.
[08:53.730 --> 08:55.930]  Across the board, we could bring lots of industry
[08:55.930 --> 08:58.490]  back to New York state, put a lot of people back to work.
[08:58.490 --> 09:00.090]  Hemp is really an industrial crop.
[09:00.090 --> 09:02.450]  It should just regain its rightful place
[09:02.490 --> 09:04.450]  in the American agricultural landscape.
[09:04.450 --> 09:07.210]  The global demand for industrial hemp is growing.
[09:07.210 --> 09:18.240]  And here in New York, the possibilities are endless.
[09:18.240 --> 09:20.760]  Possibilities are endless.
[09:20.760 --> 09:23.440]  You know, one of the words that the dean and I like
[09:23.440 --> 09:25.640]  to share with each other quite a bit is collaboration.
[09:25.640 --> 09:27.400]  We talked about that a little bit earlier.
[09:27.400 --> 09:32.280]  But I think when we collaborate, and we have our partners here
[09:32.280 --> 09:35.040]  in the room, and we have our partners on the same page,
[09:35.040 --> 09:37.320]  who can be against this?
[09:37.840 --> 09:40.120]  I like our chances here.
[09:40.120 --> 09:43.560]  The governor is very much committed to this idea.
[09:43.560 --> 09:45.760]  He's excited about hemp.
[09:45.760 --> 09:48.280]  And we talk about it on a regular basis.
[09:48.280 --> 09:51.560]  So this is, I just want to say from the state standpoint,
[09:51.560 --> 09:53.800]  we're committed to staying with this
[09:53.800 --> 09:56.120]  and doing the things that we need to do.
[09:56.120 --> 09:58.280]  So there's a vision behind all of this.
[09:58.280 --> 10:00.680]  There's a very practical side of it.
[10:00.680 --> 10:03.560]  Today's summit is, even though we've been working at this,
[10:03.560 --> 10:06.880]  many of you for a long time, certainly many of us
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.400]  at the state level for a couple of years now,
[10:11.400 --> 10:14.000]  coming up with the ideas and doing the necessary work
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.760]  to get it over the hump.
[10:15.760 --> 10:17.480]  We're not done yet.
[10:17.480 --> 10:18.560]  There's more to do.
[10:18.560 --> 10:21.520]  And this summit is really just the beginning.
[10:21.520 --> 10:23.960]  So excited to be here.
[10:23.960 --> 10:25.640]  The lieutenant governor, when we got
[10:25.640 --> 10:28.080]  done with our session this morning,
[10:28.080 --> 10:31.200]  we had a good conversation with a number of our partners.
[10:31.200 --> 10:32.840]  We heard some needs.
[10:32.840 --> 10:37.440]  We heard some things that needed to be done in order for us
[10:37.440 --> 10:40.080]  to take those next steps going forward.
[10:40.080 --> 10:42.040]  And I'm just going to summarize for you now
[10:42.040 --> 10:46.600]  some of the deliverables from this morning session that
[10:46.600 --> 10:49.000]  are underway.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.080]  As you know, the first legislation,
[10:51.080 --> 10:56.080]  which was sponsored by my colleague here to the left,
[10:56.080 --> 10:59.280]  helped us get started and allowed the department
[10:59.280 --> 11:03.680]  to designate some areas attached to research institutions
[11:03.680 --> 11:08.160]  to begin to do some work on hemp in New York State.
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.800]  Well, we've issued the first ever research permits
[11:10.800 --> 11:13.120]  to private farms and businesses.
[11:13.120 --> 11:15.640]  And previously, that pilot program
[11:15.640 --> 11:19.160]  was limited to the research institutions.
[11:19.160 --> 11:21.440]  But at the governor's direction, we've
[11:21.440 --> 11:24.240]  expanded the pilot to include private entities.
[11:24.240 --> 11:26.440]  So six of those private farms and businesses
[11:26.440 --> 11:28.080]  were issued permits.
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.280]  Bring the total number of hemp research sites
[11:31.280 --> 11:33.720]  across the state to 10.
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.360]  So we've added 21st Century Hemp and RIT in Rochester.
[11:38.360 --> 11:42.200]  We've added Cavalero Farms in Goshen, New York.
[11:42.200 --> 11:45.000]  Once again, JD Farms in Eaton, New York.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.080]  Old Mutt Creek Farm in Hudson, New York.
[11:48.080 --> 11:50.640]  The Plant Science Labs in Buffalo.
[11:50.640 --> 11:54.040]  And Preprocess in Ellsberg, New York.
[11:54.040 --> 11:55.760]  A couple of other things of note that we
[11:55.760 --> 11:59.160]  heard from our partners this morning.
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.000]  Going forward, we're going to seek DEA permit allowing
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.760]  businesses to import seed and establish a seed distribution
[12:06.760 --> 12:09.480]  site for international imports.
[12:09.480 --> 12:12.800]  We heard about the importance of seed.
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.680]  Importing seed is central to research in New York State.
[12:16.680 --> 12:20.680]  And in addition to that, we are seeking a US Drug Enforcement
[12:20.680 --> 12:23.000]  Agency permit to import the seed.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.280]  So the New York State Department of Ag and Markets
[12:25.280 --> 12:28.040]  will advocate to ease the federal requirements
[12:28.040 --> 12:29.400]  to acquire hemp seed.
[12:29.400 --> 12:32.080]  So we'll be making the federal efforts as well.
[12:32.080 --> 12:34.320]  But in the meantime, we will hold the permit
[12:34.320 --> 12:36.400]  at the department.
[12:36.400 --> 12:39.400]  Happy to announce that we're going to award $400,000
[12:39.400 --> 12:41.880]  to Cornell University to continue
[12:41.880 --> 12:44.120]  to expand the research.
[12:44.120 --> 12:46.680]  We heard that loud and clear.
[12:46.680 --> 12:49.880]  The researchers at Cornell's Ag Experiment Station in Geneva
[12:49.880 --> 12:52.560]  are going to explore the best practices for growing
[12:52.560 --> 12:54.760]  varieties, the best varieties of hemp,
[12:54.760 --> 12:56.880]  the different soil types, the various locations
[12:56.880 --> 12:58.160]  around the state.
[12:58.160 --> 13:00.880]  We've got a lot of catching up to do culturally
[13:00.880 --> 13:03.360]  if we're going to be successful with this crop.
[13:03.360 --> 13:05.160]  And the experiment station will also
[13:05.160 --> 13:08.280]  assess hemp seed quality for germination and weed
[13:08.280 --> 13:09.000]  contamination.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.040]  So thank you for that.
[13:11.040 --> 13:13.360]  We're going to establish a hemp technical team.
[13:13.360 --> 13:15.760]  The lieutenant governor talked about this
[13:15.760 --> 13:19.520]  to support optimal growing and processing of hemp.
[13:19.520 --> 13:22.200]  The state will establish a hemp technical team consisting
[13:22.240 --> 13:25.560]  of our department at Ag and Markets, a liaison there,
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.520]  three Cornell Cooperative Extension partners, educators
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.880]  in the field.
[13:30.880 --> 13:34.440]  So we need to stay on the same page as we go forward.
[13:34.440 --> 13:35.880]  We're going to increase our testing
[13:35.880 --> 13:37.480]  capacity at the department.
[13:37.480 --> 13:40.160]  We heard about that this morning as a need.
[13:40.160 --> 13:41.840]  The department will apply for a permit
[13:41.840 --> 13:44.400]  to test industrial hemp for THC, which
[13:44.400 --> 13:47.080]  is an important part of the process, obviously.
[13:47.080 --> 13:48.840]  This additional lab capacity will
[13:48.840 --> 13:51.840]  help ensure that New York State hemp seed and other products
[13:51.880 --> 13:54.160]  are accepted in other states.
[13:54.160 --> 13:56.000]  Testing will also provide protection
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.360]  to the department, the growers, the researchers,
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.160]  that the crops meet the acceptable THC level.
[14:02.160 --> 14:04.080]  We're going to create a working group on top
[14:04.080 --> 14:05.760]  of the technical team, a working group
[14:05.760 --> 14:08.720]  to stay on the same page again to support
[14:08.720 --> 14:10.360]  industry development.
[14:10.360 --> 14:13.000]  It will include academic partners, key industry
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.300]  members, other state agencies to strengthen the hemp
[14:16.300 --> 14:18.920]  industry in New York State.
[14:18.920 --> 14:20.880]  The working group will help build relationships,
[14:20.880 --> 14:24.200]  share information on best management practices,
[14:24.200 --> 14:27.360]  regulatory requirements, and as we go forward,
[14:27.360 --> 14:31.400]  identify the research needs that come up.
[14:31.400 --> 14:33.360]  We're going to engage stakeholders in program
[14:33.360 --> 14:34.400]  development.
[14:34.400 --> 14:36.440]  So we're all partners in this.
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.920]  We'll seek input from farmers, researchers, industry leaders.
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.960]  We'll look to revise the pilot program
[14:42.960 --> 14:46.720]  as we need to, the regulations and the program requirements.
[14:46.720 --> 14:49.920]  And in addition, we'll propose changes
[14:49.920 --> 14:52.760]  to minimize the oversight of the research done
[14:52.760 --> 14:56.720]  by the educational institutions as it's appropriate.
[14:56.720 --> 14:59.800]  And I think this is clearly a very important point
[14:59.800 --> 15:03.040]  to make here, advocate for the federal policies
[15:03.040 --> 15:05.800]  to boost the industry.
[15:05.800 --> 15:07.160]  We're still restricted.
[15:07.160 --> 15:09.360]  We still have this cloud hanging over our head
[15:09.360 --> 15:11.480]  and over this industry.
[15:11.480 --> 15:13.760]  But the governor has an office in Washington, DC.
[15:13.760 --> 15:14.760]  They're very active.
[15:14.760 --> 15:17.880]  They're on the same page with you and with us.
[15:17.880 --> 15:21.520]  They have influence with the Congress down there.
[15:21.520 --> 15:23.760]  For me, at the Department of Agriculture
[15:23.760 --> 15:25.480]  and at our other agencies in the state,
[15:25.480 --> 15:27.800]  we all have national relationships
[15:27.800 --> 15:30.760]  with other commissioners, secretaries, and directors.
[15:30.760 --> 15:33.120]  And that organization will also advocate
[15:33.120 --> 15:34.640]  and will work through those channels
[15:34.640 --> 15:37.840]  as well to help advance what we know to be
[15:37.840 --> 15:39.920]  the right direction to go in.
[15:39.920 --> 15:41.640]  So I think I'm encouraged.
[15:41.640 --> 15:43.320]  I'm encouraged at the national level.
[15:43.320 --> 15:46.320]  I'm encouraged certainly here at the state level.
[15:46.320 --> 15:48.760]  I think as you go through this afternoon,
[15:48.760 --> 15:50.840]  you will see the quality of program,
[15:50.840 --> 15:53.200]  the quality of people involved in here.
[15:53.200 --> 15:56.680]  And you should be encouraged as well.
[15:56.680 --> 16:00.680]  With that, let me introduce our partner and assembly member,
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.000]  Donna Lepardo, who has sent me more emails in the last year
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.120]  than I've gotten from any other single source, I think.
[16:09.120 --> 16:10.440]  She's very focused.
[16:10.440 --> 16:11.480]  She's very passionate.
[16:11.480 --> 16:15.080]  She cares a great deal about her people, her farms,
[16:15.080 --> 16:18.920]  her agriculture here in New York State, and this mission.
[16:18.920 --> 16:22.280]  So with that, thank you, Assemblymember Lepardo.
[16:22.280 --> 16:23.840]  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
[16:23.840 --> 16:27.680]  Thank you.
[16:27.680 --> 16:30.320]  Yes, you should have never given me that email address.
[16:30.320 --> 16:32.840]  That was your first problem.
[16:32.840 --> 16:34.120]  Well, hi, everyone.
[16:34.120 --> 16:36.760]  It's really very nice of you to all be here today.
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.240]  And you share, I'm sure, our interest and passion
[16:40.240 --> 16:43.800]  in this new, exciting crop, industrial hemp.
[16:43.800 --> 16:45.200]  Many of us, I'm sure, in the room
[16:45.200 --> 16:49.720]  are old enough to have lamented for a very, very long time
[16:49.720 --> 16:52.680]  that this crop was something we could not grow.
[16:52.680 --> 16:55.760]  And as I became more familiar with the potential
[16:55.760 --> 16:58.720]  of this crop, it was really unacceptable,
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.560]  to be honest with you, that we had a consumer
[17:01.560 --> 17:03.400]  demand for products.
[17:03.400 --> 17:05.240]  People were purchasing products.
[17:05.240 --> 17:07.920]  People were manufacturing products
[17:07.920 --> 17:10.520]  with imported materials.
[17:10.520 --> 17:13.240]  And it didn't make any sense to me whatsoever
[17:13.240 --> 17:16.920]  that we weren't able to afford our farmers that opportunity
[17:16.920 --> 17:20.800]  and to give manufacturers homegrown, local product.
[17:20.800 --> 17:22.960]  And when the Farm Bill came along,
[17:22.960 --> 17:26.360]  which allowed New York State to become a place where
[17:26.360 --> 17:30.200]  we could do pilot research, Senator O'Mara and I
[17:30.200 --> 17:31.120]  jumped all over it.
[17:31.120 --> 17:34.680]  And it was a bit of a stretch for people.
[17:34.680 --> 17:37.280]  We had to go one by one with the Vote Hemp,
[17:37.280 --> 17:39.760]  Why Industrial Hemp sheet, and explain to people right
[17:39.760 --> 17:41.720]  off the bat that it was not marijuana.
[17:41.720 --> 17:42.520]  It was a cousin.
[17:43.520 --> 17:44.240]  It was that.
[17:44.240 --> 17:46.320]  And they finally understood, especially
[17:46.320 --> 17:48.800]  for places like upstate New York,
[17:48.800 --> 17:52.520]  the enormous economic potential for not only farmers,
[17:52.520 --> 17:54.040]  but for manufacturers.
[17:54.040 --> 17:57.160]  I come from Endicott, New York, and represent Endicott
[17:57.160 --> 18:01.000]  and Binghamton area, which was all about shoes and computers.
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.720]  It was a manufacturing town.
[18:02.720 --> 18:04.480]  So many places are as well.
[18:04.480 --> 18:06.840]  And to get the economic developers
[18:06.840 --> 18:11.160]  to have this come to clarity for them,
[18:11.160 --> 18:13.160]  that this isn't just about growing a crop.
[18:13.160 --> 18:17.240]  This is about producing goods and services,
[18:17.240 --> 18:19.840]  but making goods again in New York State.
[18:19.840 --> 18:22.760]  And I think that's what really began to turn people around
[18:22.760 --> 18:24.040]  about this.
[18:24.040 --> 18:25.600]  The following year, the Farm Bill
[18:25.600 --> 18:29.520]  gave us another opportunity to not only research this crop,
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.760]  but to also market it, transport it, process it, and sell it.
[18:34.760 --> 18:36.720]  If it were not for that particular bill,
[18:36.720 --> 18:38.080]  all the research crops would have
[18:38.080 --> 18:39.480]  had to have been destroyed, which
[18:39.480 --> 18:41.480]  would have been a terrible thing, because the 40
[18:41.480 --> 18:44.000]  acres of beautiful hemp that you're seeing depicted
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.720]  in this logo behind us at JD Farms
[18:46.720 --> 18:49.280]  was just a spectacular thing to see.
[18:49.280 --> 18:53.640]  And it smells pretty good, too, by the way, I must say.
[18:53.640 --> 19:00.080]  And so we are now able to take advantage, full advantage,
[19:00.080 --> 19:01.680]  of what they have allowed.
[19:01.680 --> 19:03.760]  We've stalked this at the federal level.
[19:03.760 --> 19:06.840]  Whatever they've allowed, we've come right behind it.
[19:06.840 --> 19:10.440]  Senator Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell
[19:10.440 --> 19:11.840]  are the sponsors of these bills.
[19:11.840 --> 19:14.520]  And some of our own senators, Senator Gillibrand,
[19:14.520 --> 19:19.040]  are sponsors of the Industrial Hemp Farming Act.
[19:19.040 --> 19:21.800]  While they are trying to figure this out in Washington,
[19:21.800 --> 19:23.560]  New York State is positioning itself
[19:23.560 --> 19:28.240]  to be very competitive in all manner of hemp,
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.760]  whether it's in the pharmaceutical,
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.000]  nutraceutical, textiles, various food,
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.520]  and other products that are already in the works.
[19:38.520 --> 19:39.400]  It's very exciting.
[19:39.400 --> 19:42.320]  So when the federal government does relax this,
[19:42.320 --> 19:44.760]  which will make it a little bit easier for us,
[19:44.760 --> 19:46.360]  we will have the Northeast pretty much
[19:46.360 --> 19:47.880]  sewed up, as far as I can tell.
[19:47.880 --> 19:49.460]  And all of you who are in the room who
[19:49.460 --> 19:51.920]  are expecting to get involved in this, I think,
[19:51.920 --> 19:54.080]  will be very pleased with the outcome.
[19:54.080 --> 19:58.680]  Commissioner Ball mentioned some of the fabulous developments
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.560]  at the state level.
[19:59.560 --> 20:01.400]  We're very lucky that the state is
[20:01.400 --> 20:07.680]  willing to really come to assist on the DEA seed
[20:07.680 --> 20:12.720]  acquisition issue and all the rest of these considerations
[20:12.720 --> 20:15.640]  with research dollars coming behind it
[20:15.640 --> 20:17.000]  and trying to make it easier.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.540]  For those of you who have been involved in the craft beverage
[20:19.540 --> 20:23.080]  industry, once the state got its head wrapped around making
[20:23.080 --> 20:26.880]  it easier for craft beverages, you have seen the results.
[20:26.880 --> 20:28.920]  And I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt
[20:28.920 --> 20:33.760]  that this is the next thing that the governor and team
[20:33.760 --> 20:36.600]  are putting their full force and focus behind.
[20:36.600 --> 20:39.360]  It's really a very exciting time for those of us
[20:39.360 --> 20:41.560]  who have long, long wished that hemp
[20:41.560 --> 20:43.920]  could be receiving its due.
[20:43.920 --> 20:48.080]  So what I want to just say in closing
[20:48.080 --> 20:52.080]  is that just to get everybody on the same page,
[20:52.080 --> 20:55.320]  we had 10 research licenses as part of the original program.
[20:55.320 --> 20:57.680]  And those have all been filled.
[20:57.680 --> 21:00.800]  What is about to happen now as part of the recent budget
[21:00.800 --> 21:03.000]  is going, again, as the commissioner mentioned,
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.040]  going to be unlimited licenses available.
[21:05.040 --> 21:07.640]  But regs have to be established for that.
[21:07.640 --> 21:11.640]  So we're a little behind for this growing season.
[21:11.640 --> 21:14.280]  But I would fully expect, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.200]  that 2018 will very likely be the year
[21:18.200 --> 21:23.200]  when we can see a much larger build out among farmers
[21:23.200 --> 21:24.560]  who are interested.
[21:24.560 --> 21:26.600]  It's going to be critical, however,
[21:26.600 --> 21:29.920]  that those farmers understand the supply chain
[21:29.920 --> 21:32.760]  and are going to be growing for a particular market.
[21:32.760 --> 21:35.840]  So they're not just randomly growing some random cultivar.
[21:35.840 --> 21:38.520]  They're going to be growing for a particular market.
[21:38.520 --> 21:41.120]  And that market is going to have processing available.
[21:41.120 --> 21:44.520]  And we have in the mix proposals right now
[21:44.520 --> 21:49.920]  to do hubs in the area, whether it be on CBD oil or in fiber.
[21:49.920 --> 21:53.600]  So in 2018, you may very well be in a position
[21:53.600 --> 21:57.560]  to have a marriage with a particular company that
[21:57.560 --> 21:59.600]  wants a certain type of strain.
[21:59.600 --> 22:01.840]  And you may have a processor in the mix.
[22:01.840 --> 22:04.760]  So it's all seamless with the assistance from the state.
[22:04.760 --> 22:07.680]  So thanks for your patience over these years and decades
[22:07.680 --> 22:10.280]  for some of us who have cared about this plant.
[22:10.280 --> 22:11.680]  Our time has finally come.
[22:11.680 --> 22:14.400]  And I'm absolutely delighted to be a part of it.
[22:14.400 --> 22:17.440]  And I'm happy to play whatever role I need to in the future.
[22:17.440 --> 22:22.860]  Thank you.
