[00:00.190 --> 00:04.350]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.350 --> 00:13.200]  Yeah, unfortunately, you're going to hear legal stuff at the end of the day.
[00:13.200 --> 00:15.500]  I'm going to try to keep this a little breezy.
[00:15.500 --> 00:17.580]  I mean, what you've heard was from
[00:17.580 --> 00:21.540]  your public officials all sorts of excitement about the opportunities.
[00:21.540 --> 00:25.260]  You heard actually really fascinating information from
[00:25.260 --> 00:28.780]  the researchers and the scientists about what they're doing,
[00:28.780 --> 00:31.780]  really interesting stuff about the farmers.
[00:31.780 --> 00:35.180]  Now, I can get to talk about regulations.
[00:35.180 --> 00:38.060]  But I don't think of them as regulations really.
[00:38.060 --> 00:42.140]  I think really it's just creating an environment,
[00:42.140 --> 00:44.300]  hopefully a safe environment,
[00:44.300 --> 00:49.940]  given that the Farm Bill essentially creates carve-outs to work in this area,
[00:49.940 --> 00:54.300]  and leaves it to the state to develop a program either through
[00:54.300 --> 01:00.340]  its own research program or through educational institutions to establish programs
[01:00.340 --> 01:05.420]  which permit the research and study of this plant.
[01:05.420 --> 01:10.260]  What we're attempting to do is listen to the folks who are interested in it,
[01:10.260 --> 01:12.680]  listen to the industry's needs,
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.340]  and try to form a program that addresses the needs of
[01:17.340 --> 01:24.420]  industry to study and research and create a base when things,
[01:24.420 --> 01:30.420]  hopefully, change in Washington so that this industry can really launch and grow.
[01:30.420 --> 01:33.420]  So that's what we're up to,
[01:33.420 --> 01:36.660]  and it's an iterative process.
[01:36.660 --> 01:40.220]  I mean, I've been at the agency for about four years,
[01:40.220 --> 01:45.700]  and I think we're on our third set of regulations in industrial hemp,
[01:45.700 --> 01:50.180]  which is a lot of regulatory work.
[01:50.180 --> 01:53.660]  What we're currently in the process of doing now,
[01:53.860 --> 01:58.820]  is taking what we've built on and expanding it so that our,
[01:58.820 --> 02:02.100]  essentially, private partners have rules of the game.
[02:02.100 --> 02:05.060]  We've adopted program regulations in connection with
[02:05.060 --> 02:08.860]  the six sites which were available under our current law.
[02:08.860 --> 02:11.300]  As you've heard, we've now,
[02:11.300 --> 02:14.700]  well, with current legislative session,
[02:14.700 --> 02:18.340]  we've essentially eliminated that 10-site limitation.
[02:18.340 --> 02:22.260]  So there's a large opportunity for people who are interested in
[02:22.260 --> 02:25.460]  the area to make application to the department
[02:25.460 --> 02:28.420]  to engage in the study and research in industrial hemp.
[02:28.420 --> 02:30.900]  The range of, I guess,
[02:30.900 --> 02:34.900]  the range of research is almost as broad as the number,
[02:34.900 --> 02:37.780]  the huge number of applications for this particular product.
[02:37.780 --> 02:40.420]  So while we're in the Ag department,
[02:40.420 --> 02:42.580]  we often think about agronomic research.
[02:42.580 --> 02:48.620]  I mean, it goes from agronomic research to studying cultivars, growing conditions,
[02:48.620 --> 02:51.500]  but it also involves market research and production.
[02:51.540 --> 02:54.940]  So it's an entire array of possibilities,
[02:54.940 --> 02:57.740]  some of which we are quite familiar with,
[02:57.740 --> 03:01.220]  and some of which we haven't traditionally been involved in.
[03:01.220 --> 03:03.700]  So it's a learning process on our part.
[03:03.700 --> 03:07.020]  One of the fun things about listening to all these panelists is,
[03:07.020 --> 03:08.820]  a lot of it, you're going,
[03:08.820 --> 03:10.060]  yeah, I learned that,
[03:10.060 --> 03:11.620]  but there's so much more to learn.
[03:11.620 --> 03:12.980]  So from the legal side,
[03:12.980 --> 03:17.020]  it's a really exciting area because it both exposes
[03:17.180 --> 03:22.020]  your knowledge base and also your profound ignorance about what can happen.
[03:22.020 --> 03:25.940]  So it's sort of like a lot of fun because, one,
[03:25.940 --> 03:30.700]  a lot of the things we see and that the department has done has been done over time.
[03:30.700 --> 03:32.100]  And it's a building effort.
[03:32.100 --> 03:35.940]  And we're dealing with structures that already have been created.
[03:35.940 --> 03:37.220]  This is a new opportunity.
[03:37.220 --> 03:38.740]  It's a new program.
[03:38.740 --> 03:45.260]  So you can form it and mold it and try to make it work as efficiently as possible,
[03:45.300 --> 03:48.620]  which is both challenging and exciting.
[03:48.620 --> 03:52.420]  So it's interesting for me.
[03:52.420 --> 03:55.540]  Hopefully, it's interesting and useful for you.
[03:55.540 --> 04:02.820]  And I can't emphasize how important it is to get input from the folks who are there
[04:02.820 --> 04:04.980]  in the fields doing the research,
[04:04.980 --> 04:08.540]  doing the growing, and getting information because,
[04:08.540 --> 04:11.220]  I mean, regulations are just really rules of the game.
[04:11.220 --> 04:14.180]  So we try to create certainty and clarity.
[04:14.220 --> 04:16.540]  Everyone knows what's going on.
[04:16.540 --> 04:21.380]  And you can perform in a relatively easy environment
[04:21.380 --> 04:24.300]  because what's required is clear.
[04:24.300 --> 04:28.620]  And it addresses sort of your needs.
[04:28.620 --> 04:34.220]  So saying all of that, I'll give you a breezy introduction
[04:34.220 --> 04:40.020]  to what our program currently looks like and essentially will look like
[04:40.020 --> 04:43.260]  because it's really pretty simple.
[04:43.260 --> 04:47.700]  Notwithstanding, the challenge is we're working in a murky federal environment.
[04:47.700 --> 04:52.900]  So you've got transitioning where you've got carve-outs under the federal farm bill.
[04:52.900 --> 04:56.180]  You've got additional supplements in connection with the omnibus budget bill,
[04:56.180 --> 04:59.900]  which expands sort of the range and scope of these activities.
[04:59.900 --> 05:02.180]  But they're not particularly fleshed out.
[05:02.180 --> 05:05.340]  You've got uncertainty at the federal regulatory level
[05:05.340 --> 05:08.260]  when you speak to the agencies.
[05:08.260 --> 05:13.140]  They're sort of tentative in their approach because it's new to them.
[05:13.140 --> 05:16.380]  And the states are the ones who are really developing these programs.
[05:16.380 --> 05:19.580]  So in some ways, we have lots of opportunity.
[05:19.580 --> 05:22.100]  But in a certain sense, we're also on our own
[05:22.100 --> 05:26.780]  in trying to develop programs that serve the needs of the industry
[05:26.780 --> 05:28.780]  and serve the needs of the public.
[05:28.780 --> 05:30.220]  And that's sort of what we're up to.
[05:30.220 --> 05:34.340]  So essentially, currently, we've got a research program.
[05:34.340 --> 05:38.020]  We're accepting private partners.
[05:38.020 --> 05:40.380]  We also work with educational institutions.
[05:40.380 --> 05:42.980]  But generally, our approach to both of these entities
[05:42.980 --> 05:44.220]  is pretty much the same.
[05:44.220 --> 05:46.260]  You've got an application process.
[05:46.260 --> 05:48.460]  The application is fairly straightforward.
[05:48.460 --> 05:52.660]  And the information that is required is fairly directed.
[05:52.660 --> 05:57.420]  We obviously, as required by law, require disclosure of the sites.
[05:57.420 --> 06:01.860]  We are looking for research proposals because ultimately,
[06:01.860 --> 06:06.540]  our pilot projects are pilot projects for research and study.
[06:06.540 --> 06:11.340]  So when Dan tells us you've got to be thoughtful and you've got a plan,
[06:11.340 --> 06:15.220]  that's true in terms of your approach to this agency as well.
[06:15.220 --> 06:18.780]  Because what we're looking for is a thoughtful plan
[06:18.780 --> 06:23.220]  as to what areas you would like to work in and develop,
[06:23.220 --> 06:25.860]  which contributes to the knowledge and the development
[06:25.860 --> 06:28.460]  of this particular industry.
[06:28.460 --> 06:32.180]  But it's research and study-based.
[06:32.180 --> 06:35.540]  And it also needs to be appropriately scaled to the project
[06:35.540 --> 06:37.140]  that you're proposing.
[06:37.140 --> 06:41.020]  So I mean, we've had suggestions in our regulations
[06:41.020 --> 06:43.580]  about agronomic research and marketing research.
[06:43.580 --> 06:46.820]  But essentially, what you really need to do
[06:46.820 --> 06:49.260]  to have a successful application is to think
[06:49.260 --> 06:52.740]  about what you want to research, what areas can be developed,
[06:52.740 --> 06:55.100]  and then make the proposal to the agency.
[06:55.100 --> 06:56.620]  And we're pretty flexible.
[06:56.620 --> 06:58.380]  But you need to develop that.
[06:58.380 --> 06:59.740]  It's got to be serious.
[06:59.740 --> 07:01.460]  It's got to be thoughtful.
[07:01.460 --> 07:06.540]  And if it is, then chances are you're going to be reviewed favorably.
[07:06.540 --> 07:08.620]  You also need to think about security issues.
[07:08.620 --> 07:11.460]  Now, security issues, from our experience,
[07:11.460 --> 07:13.220]  has been sort of interesting.
[07:13.220 --> 07:18.340]  When we first embarked upon looking at regulations,
[07:18.340 --> 07:21.500]  there was a huge security concern.
[07:21.500 --> 07:27.940]  And we were thinking that we really needed a very structured approach
[07:27.940 --> 07:31.860]  to the kind of security that was necessary for folks cultivating
[07:31.860 --> 07:34.180]  industrial hemp.
[07:34.180 --> 07:38.340]  And as we learned more about other states' experience
[07:38.340 --> 07:43.140]  and other growers' experience, we had a much softer approach.
[07:43.140 --> 07:46.180]  And currently, while you need a security plan,
[07:46.180 --> 07:48.500]  the security plan needs to be a sensible one.
[07:48.500 --> 07:52.260]  You need to consider what kind of access
[07:52.260 --> 07:58.420]  there is to the plants being grown or access to the facility.
[07:58.420 --> 08:01.140]  And we don't have any specific requirements.
[08:01.140 --> 08:05.060]  But what you really need to do is assess the risks
[08:05.060 --> 08:07.700]  that you may have in connection with security issues,
[08:07.700 --> 08:11.220]  and then adopt appropriate responses to those risks.
[08:11.220 --> 08:13.100]  So it's a more flexible approach.
[08:13.100 --> 08:14.500]  It's not a top-down.
[08:14.500 --> 08:16.900]  You've got to fence your growing areas.
[08:16.900 --> 08:19.860]  You've got to have a particular kind of signage.
[08:19.860 --> 08:21.860]  But it's more of an iterative process,
[08:21.860 --> 08:24.060]  where you think about what your problems could be
[08:24.060 --> 08:25.540]  and how do you address them.
[08:25.540 --> 08:29.180]  And that's sort of the approach we've taken.
[08:29.180 --> 08:32.380]  I'd also mention that the scale is important.
[08:32.380 --> 08:34.700]  We're talking about demonstration projects.
[08:34.700 --> 08:38.900]  So that doesn't necessarily need to be really, really tiny.
[08:38.900 --> 08:40.820]  But it needs to be appropriately scaled.
[08:40.820 --> 08:45.220]  So what you're researching is appropriate to the amount
[08:45.220 --> 08:48.340]  you're going to be cultivating.
[08:48.340 --> 08:50.220]  There are obviously issues in connection
[08:50.220 --> 08:53.340]  with what we do in evaluating.
[08:53.340 --> 08:56.780]  I mean, basically, we will be looking at background checks.
[08:56.780 --> 08:59.900]  And we will be looking at past experience.
[08:59.900 --> 09:01.820]  It was sort of interesting in our discussions
[09:01.820 --> 09:03.700]  with other state agencies.
[09:03.700 --> 09:07.140]  This was an area that people identified, yeah,
[09:07.140 --> 09:08.100]  there's a concern here.
[09:08.100 --> 09:11.100]  We had applicants who had all sorts of issues,
[09:11.100 --> 09:12.980]  be it regulatory or otherwise.
[09:12.980 --> 09:14.780]  So you need to be mindful and make sure
[09:14.780 --> 09:17.660]  that the folks you partner with in research
[09:17.660 --> 09:19.020]  are responsible individuals.
[09:19.020 --> 09:22.100]  And that's sort of what we're looking for.
[09:22.100 --> 09:25.660]  So there are requirements for disclosure.
[09:25.660 --> 09:27.100]  And you take a look at that.
[09:31.940 --> 09:36.220]  We basically are requiring our partners
[09:36.220 --> 09:39.860]  to enter into partnership agreements or research partner
[09:39.860 --> 09:40.500]  agreements.
[09:40.500 --> 09:42.860]  And basically, that's your roadmap.
[09:42.860 --> 09:44.900]  You're going to have a regulatory structure, which
[09:44.900 --> 09:46.860]  gives you sort of like the general marks
[09:46.860 --> 09:50.980]  you need to hit in connection with what's expected of you
[09:50.980 --> 09:52.260]  as a research partner.
[09:52.260 --> 09:55.060]  That's dealt with in our research partner agreement.
[09:55.060 --> 09:56.900]  And basically, what that does is it ties you
[09:56.900 --> 09:58.420]  to a scope of work.
[09:58.420 --> 10:00.820]  So basically, you undertake to conduct a project.
[10:00.820 --> 10:03.580]  And we expect you to adhere to that project.
[10:03.580 --> 10:06.420]  It's flexible enough to modify as you're going on.
[10:06.420 --> 10:10.180]  So that if you want to go into related areas, you can.
[10:10.180 --> 10:12.180]  But if it's a separate research project,
[10:12.180 --> 10:14.060]  then you'll have to do a separate application.
[10:14.060 --> 10:15.500]  But there's flexible.
[10:15.500 --> 10:18.900]  It provides for disclosures and vetting.
[10:18.900 --> 10:23.100]  It makes clear that once you get a permit,
[10:23.100 --> 10:25.660]  that it's not a transferable permit.
[10:25.660 --> 10:27.140]  It permits subcontracting.
[10:27.140 --> 10:28.740]  We have reporting requirements.
[10:28.740 --> 10:31.660]  So basically, if you're involved in a project,
[10:31.660 --> 10:34.700]  there'll be annual reporting requirements providing data.
[10:34.700 --> 10:37.060]  But at the same time, our research partnership agreement
[10:37.060 --> 10:38.740]  protects your intellectual property.
[10:38.740 --> 10:40.300]  That which you develop is yours.
[10:40.300 --> 10:43.420]  And we make it clear that it's yours.
[10:43.420 --> 10:45.500]  So that's covered in our agreement.
[10:45.500 --> 10:49.820]  We deal with testing regimens and procedures
[10:49.820 --> 10:52.180]  to make sure that it is indeed, when you get it,
[10:52.220 --> 10:53.100]  it's industrial hemp.
[10:53.100 --> 10:55.100]  And when you grow it, it's industrial hemp.
[10:57.100 --> 11:00.020]  One of the useful things for us in connection
[11:00.020 --> 11:01.900]  with sitting through this summit,
[11:01.900 --> 11:04.220]  we heard issues with respect to hot seed.
[11:04.220 --> 11:06.860]  And that's something that we probably
[11:06.860 --> 11:08.980]  need to take a closer look at.
[11:08.980 --> 11:12.420]  Because this is a new issue that, I don't know if Chris
[11:12.420 --> 11:14.580]  had seen it, but it was a new issue for me.
[11:14.580 --> 11:17.780]  And it's something that we deal with in our partnership
[11:17.780 --> 11:18.300]  agreements.
[11:18.300 --> 11:19.780]  But it's something I think we maybe
[11:19.780 --> 11:23.820]  want to kick the tires a little better on.
[11:23.820 --> 11:25.940]  We deal with security.
[11:25.940 --> 11:31.260]  So that's sort of the structure of our program.
[11:31.260 --> 11:33.220]  It was the structure of our program before.
[11:33.220 --> 11:36.100]  It's a little bit more formalized now.
[11:36.100 --> 11:42.140]  And that's sort of where we are.
[11:42.140 --> 11:47.700]  One of the things I would encourage you all to do,
[11:47.700 --> 11:52.180]  because we will be formulating regulations.
[11:52.180 --> 11:54.260]  And there's a lot of public comment.
[11:54.260 --> 11:56.580]  And we look forward to that comment,
[11:56.580 --> 12:00.660]  both during once we publish regulations, we get comment.
[12:00.660 --> 12:06.900]  But even now, before they get published, give me a call.
[12:06.900 --> 12:08.420]  Talk to us.
[12:08.420 --> 12:10.860]  If there are issues we need to focus on,
[12:10.860 --> 12:14.940]  you are the best folks to advise what those issues are.
[12:14.940 --> 12:16.580]  Because you're working in the field.
[12:16.580 --> 12:19.740]  Hey, I'm just a lawyer.
[12:19.740 --> 12:22.380]  And I can create clear regulations.
[12:22.380 --> 12:24.580]  I can create clear rules.
[12:24.580 --> 12:27.820]  But basically, it's your knowledge base
[12:27.820 --> 12:30.700]  that helps me get to a position where everyone
[12:30.700 --> 12:32.300]  knows what's going on.
[12:32.300 --> 12:37.100]  And we can do a program that works for you.
[12:37.100 --> 12:38.900]  Because ultimately, that's what our job is,
[12:38.900 --> 12:44.900]  to create a clear set of rules that you can understand,
[12:44.900 --> 12:48.940]  that you can follow, and creates a space for you
[12:48.940 --> 12:53.380]  to operate that won't run into problems
[12:53.380 --> 12:55.340]  with federal authorities.
[12:55.340 --> 12:58.220]  And that's what I've got to say.
[12:58.220 --> 12:59.140]  Thank you, Scott.
[12:59.140 --> 13:07.880]  Thank you, Scott.
[13:07.880 --> 13:10.120]  So I think the one thing that I would reiterate,
[13:10.120 --> 13:13.120]  I don't have a great deal to add to what Scott has talked
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.080]  about this afternoon on the regulations.
[13:16.080 --> 13:17.960]  But I think going forward, one of the things
[13:18.120 --> 13:20.760]  I'd like to reiterate, which Scott brought up,
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.240]  is the importance of, in the application process
[13:25.240 --> 13:27.720]  and in the regulation, the importance of formulating
[13:27.720 --> 13:29.760]  the research questions and articulating
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.240]  that in a clear way to us.
[13:34.240 --> 13:36.880]  Up until now, this has been a program
[13:36.880 --> 13:39.120]  where we had a limitation of 10 permits.
[13:39.120 --> 13:41.760]  And there has been the ability to have
[13:41.760 --> 13:43.840]  a great deal of interaction with applicants.
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.160]  And also, the ability to have us, when we get an application
[13:48.160 --> 13:51.920]  and we have questions, to call people and clarify.
[13:51.920 --> 13:53.520]  And I think as this goes forward,
[13:53.520 --> 13:56.000]  based upon the interest that I've seen here today
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.280]  and the number of phone calls I've had, as we go forward
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.840]  and this becomes a higher volume program for us, if you will,
[14:03.840 --> 14:05.400]  it's going to be very, very important
[14:05.400 --> 14:08.440]  that when the research or when the applications come into us,
[14:08.440 --> 14:12.800]  that the research questions are well thought out.
[14:12.840 --> 14:15.440]  And I guess one of the things that I would throw out there
[14:15.440 --> 14:19.440]  to people, as well as Scott and myself and other staff at Ag
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.760]  and Markets being available to help,
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.520]  is also the folks who have gone before,
[14:27.520 --> 14:30.800]  whether they're the Morrisville folks or the Cornell people
[14:30.800 --> 14:33.720]  or the Cooperative Extension people out there,
[14:33.720 --> 14:37.520]  who can help you to formulate a good research question
[14:37.520 --> 14:41.040]  and get a strong proposal into us.
[14:41.040 --> 14:42.640]  It takes the same amount of effort
[14:42.640 --> 14:45.040]  to look at something that's strong and well-written
[14:45.040 --> 14:47.920]  versus something that perhaps is not as strong.
[14:47.920 --> 14:49.840]  So I think that's going to be really important
[14:49.840 --> 14:52.880]  as the volume of the program increases.
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.120]  All right, we're going to entertain one question
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.800]  because we're running up against the end of our lease
[15:01.800 --> 15:04.600]  time here in this space.
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.000]  But one question that producers have been asking is,
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.400]  I think it's a valid question, does growing hemp
[15:10.760 --> 15:12.720]  negate the ability to participate
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.400]  in any other federal programs given the federal rules
[15:16.400 --> 15:18.280]  about growing cannabis?
[15:21.760 --> 15:23.480]  An interesting question.
[15:23.480 --> 15:26.160]  I don't practice in the area, so I will give you
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.880]  a non-legal response which doesn't bind the agency.
[15:29.880 --> 15:31.720]  This is just my opinion.
[15:31.720 --> 15:33.680]  There's the lawyer coming out, right?
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.680]  Under the federal farm bill, a carve out was created.
[15:38.920 --> 15:41.240]  It authorizes these programs.
[15:43.560 --> 15:46.680]  My approach or my thought would be in that you have
[15:46.680 --> 15:50.880]  a specific federal carve out, it would be inappropriate
[15:50.880 --> 15:55.840]  for a federal agency to tell you that this is going
[15:55.840 --> 16:00.000]  to disqualify you from other available federal programs.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.240]  That's just my personal analysis of it.
[16:04.480 --> 16:07.480]  The federal agencies may beg to differ,
[16:07.480 --> 16:09.600]  but that's just where I am.
[16:10.920 --> 16:11.760]  Awesome.
[16:11.760 --> 16:12.920]  Chris, any last thoughts?
[16:14.640 --> 16:17.240]  All right, a round of applause for these two, please.
[16:17.240 --> 16:23.860]  We've had a great day here.
[16:23.860 --> 16:26.500]  I think it was a great morning, it was a great afternoon.
[16:26.500 --> 16:28.180]  We've had great panels.
[16:28.180 --> 16:31.420]  I think hopefully you've learned at least as much
[16:31.420 --> 16:33.260]  as I've come to understand.
[16:34.260 --> 16:35.580]  I think we heard a couple of things.
[16:35.580 --> 16:38.220]  So one, we heard the need to go forward
[16:38.220 --> 16:39.620]  in a collaborative manner.
[16:41.460 --> 16:44.180]  The need for state agencies to have
[16:44.180 --> 16:46.580]  kind of a uniform protocol.
[16:46.580 --> 16:49.500]  And I'm thinking in my case, the Department of Agriculture,
[16:49.500 --> 16:51.700]  Department of Health, Department of Justice,
[16:52.700 --> 16:55.020]  and frankly, our funding partners
[16:55.020 --> 16:57.420]  at Empire State Development as well.
[16:57.420 --> 16:59.940]  I think we heard about the need for continued research,
[16:59.940 --> 17:04.580]  applied research, about varieties, about fertility,
[17:04.580 --> 17:06.500]  about utilizing the right equipment,
[17:06.500 --> 17:07.660]  the right cultural methods.
[17:07.660 --> 17:09.280]  What does this mean for rotations?
[17:09.320 --> 17:12.840]  There's all kinds of questions that we have,
[17:12.840 --> 17:15.640]  which frankly kind of conjures up in my mind,
[17:16.640 --> 17:18.680]  integrated plant science.
[17:18.680 --> 17:20.680]  Isn't that what we're talking about here?
[17:20.680 --> 17:22.480]  A little plug for Cornell there.
[17:23.480 --> 17:25.480]  I think we heard a little bit, or quite a lot,
[17:25.480 --> 17:28.400]  about the need for federal advocacy
[17:29.680 --> 17:33.120]  to help lift that cloud that we're still operating under,
[17:34.040 --> 17:36.560]  addressed in that last question.
[17:36.560 --> 17:38.520]  And I'm gonna borrow a little bit from something
[17:38.520 --> 17:41.680]  that Dan Dalgen from J.D. Farm said this morning.
[17:41.680 --> 17:46.360]  I think that, I think we need the correct interaction
[17:46.360 --> 17:50.000]  between all the state agencies and our partners.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.320]  I think we need the leadership here
[17:53.320 --> 17:54.720]  at the land grant system,
[17:54.720 --> 17:56.920]  as we've evidenced today quite a lot.
[17:58.200 --> 18:00.240]  The leadership from the industry,
[18:00.240 --> 18:02.320]  which I think is certainly clear to me
[18:02.320 --> 18:04.440]  here from this meeting today,
[18:04.440 --> 18:06.040]  and exemplified in our panels.
[18:06.600 --> 18:09.160]  Also the leadership at the state level,
[18:09.160 --> 18:11.600]  which I think we've clearly demonstrated
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.200]  by the participation of our lieutenant governor
[18:14.200 --> 18:19.200]  and by the governor's actions in this new opportunity.
[18:19.200 --> 18:21.560]  And you combine that with a vision.
[18:21.560 --> 18:23.760]  And I think it needs to be a common vision
[18:23.760 --> 18:28.120]  that we all share and that we stay close to.
[18:28.120 --> 18:31.000]  So with that, let me just say we're committed to that.
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.000]  Thank you for being here.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.380]  Thank you for participation, for your energy,
[18:34.380 --> 18:36.540]  for your passion about all of this.
[18:36.540 --> 18:40.500]  A special thank you to our legislative partners
[18:40.500 --> 18:44.380]  who have helped with the legislation to make this possible.
[18:44.380 --> 18:47.200]  And certainly a special thank you to our hosts here today
[18:47.200 --> 18:50.060]  at Cornell for putting up with us all day long
[18:50.060 --> 18:51.540]  and for their continued partnership.
[18:51.540 --> 18:53.460]  So with that, thank you all for attending
[18:53.460 --> 18:56.100]  the very first EMP Summit in New York State.
[18:56.100 --> 19:03.720]  This has been a production of Cornell University.
[19:03.720 --> 19:07.480]  On the web at cornell.edu.
