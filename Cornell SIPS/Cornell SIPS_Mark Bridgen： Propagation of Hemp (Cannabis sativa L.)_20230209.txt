[00:00.000 --> 00:08.590]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.590 --> 00:09.390]  Hi, everyone.
[00:09.390 --> 00:11.710]  Welcome to the 2023 Hemp Webinar Series.
[00:11.710 --> 00:15.150]  For those of you that couldn't join us in the last webinar,
[00:15.150 --> 00:16.630]  my name is Luis Monserrate.
[00:16.630 --> 00:20.070]  I am a second year PhD student in plant breeding and genetics
[00:20.070 --> 00:22.750]  in Larry Smart's lab at Cornell University.
[00:22.750 --> 00:26.110]  Once again, I'm accompanied by Cornell alum Tony Baracco, who
[00:26.110 --> 00:30.790]  has assisted me putting this webinar together.
[00:30.790 --> 00:32.790]  From here on, I will start to sound a little bit
[00:32.790 --> 00:34.590]  like a broken record for those of you
[00:34.590 --> 00:36.190]  that joined the last webinar.
[00:36.190 --> 00:38.630]  But there are two buttons that you
[00:38.630 --> 00:40.550]  will be using during this webinar
[00:40.550 --> 00:42.390]  to interact with us and with the speaker.
[00:42.390 --> 00:45.670]  Those are the Q&A and the chat button that you see there.
[00:45.670 --> 00:48.150]  So please make sure to enter your questions to the speaker
[00:48.150 --> 00:49.670]  using the Q&A button.
[00:49.670 --> 00:51.390]  And those questions will be answered
[00:51.390 --> 00:52.990]  at the end of the talk.
[00:52.990 --> 00:55.910]  Any other dialogue can be done using the chat button.
[00:55.910 --> 00:59.350]  And please feel free to submit these suggestions
[00:59.390 --> 01:02.870]  that you may have for improvement of the series.
[01:02.870 --> 01:05.150]  And once again, lastly, I just want
[01:05.150 --> 01:06.950]  to mention that this webinar series is
[01:06.950 --> 01:09.030]  a component of a larger project, which
[01:09.030 --> 01:11.950]  is the development of eight educational modules that
[01:11.950 --> 01:14.510]  will be freely available on the Cornell HEM website
[01:14.510 --> 01:16.550]  at the end of the webinar series.
[01:16.550 --> 01:19.750]  Each of these modules will consist of the recorded webinar
[01:19.750 --> 01:22.190]  like this one, an instructional slide deck
[01:22.190 --> 01:24.710]  with more of a teaching style of the subject,
[01:24.710 --> 01:27.950]  and a set of high impact papers pertaining
[01:27.990 --> 01:30.790]  to the respective subject.
[01:30.790 --> 01:34.870]  In this case, this module will be on propagation of hemp,
[01:34.870 --> 01:36.710]  for example.
[01:36.710 --> 01:38.230]  And also, all the webinar recordings
[01:38.230 --> 01:40.350]  will be available on the Cornell 6 YouTube channel
[01:40.350 --> 01:42.590]  if you're interested in watching them or sharing them
[01:42.590 --> 01:44.030]  with someone that couldn't attend.
[01:44.030 --> 01:47.670]  So with that, I'd like to introduce our speaker.
[01:47.670 --> 01:49.590]  Today's speaker is Dr. Mark Bridgen.
[01:49.590 --> 01:51.790]  He's a professor of horticulture and plant breeding
[01:51.790 --> 01:54.470]  and genetics at Cornell University.
[01:54.470 --> 01:57.230]  And since 2002, he has served as a director
[01:57.230 --> 02:01.390]  of the Long Island Horticultural Extension
[02:01.390 --> 02:03.550]  Center, a.k.a.
[02:03.550 --> 02:06.350]  LIHREC in Riverhead, New York.
[02:06.350 --> 02:09.750]  And the topic of his talk is simply put, propagation of hemp.
[02:09.750 --> 02:12.830]  So Dr. Bridgen, if you would like to share your screen
[02:12.830 --> 02:15.190]  and just take it away.
[02:15.190 --> 02:15.710]  OK.
[02:15.710 --> 02:16.350]  All righty.
[02:16.350 --> 02:17.830]  Good afternoon, everybody.
[02:17.830 --> 02:19.710]  Thank you for joining us this afternoon
[02:19.710 --> 02:23.830]  to talk about the propagation of hemp.
[02:23.830 --> 02:26.150]  Just a little bit about me.
[02:26.150 --> 02:30.510]  Some of you have noticed that at Cornell's Long Island
[02:30.510 --> 02:36.750]  station, Cornell has a few off-campus remote locations.
[02:36.750 --> 02:38.350]  And we are the farthest one away.
[02:38.350 --> 02:43.350]  We are 300 miles away in Riverhead, New York,
[02:43.350 --> 02:45.070]  in Suffolk County.
[02:45.070 --> 02:48.270]  We just last year celebrated our 100th anniversary
[02:48.270 --> 02:49.670]  being here in Long Island.
[02:49.670 --> 02:53.990]  And the reason that we have been down here for so long
[02:53.990 --> 02:57.470]  is we are here to help the agricultural community.
[02:57.470 --> 02:59.590]  Most people, especially most New Yorkers,
[02:59.590 --> 03:02.150]  don't know that Eastern Long Island actually
[03:02.150 --> 03:05.150]  is the number one county in the state of New York
[03:05.150 --> 03:07.470]  for crop agriculture.
[03:07.470 --> 03:09.470]  We used to be number one for total agriculture.
[03:09.470 --> 03:10.970]  Now we're down about three, I think.
[03:10.970 --> 03:15.030]  But anyways, we have more greenhouses down here
[03:15.030 --> 03:17.750]  and more nurseries down here than anywhere else in the state,
[03:17.750 --> 03:21.830]  as well as over 2,000 acres of grapes, vegetables,
[03:21.830 --> 03:22.910]  and much more.
[03:23.750 --> 03:26.070]  We work with our stakeholders, which
[03:26.070 --> 03:31.030]  are very conveniently about within a 50-mile radius of us.
[03:31.030 --> 03:33.870]  We are very proud of our 100th anniversary.
[03:33.870 --> 03:38.190]  We are the only research station in the United States
[03:38.190 --> 03:42.070]  that has scientists that represents each of the commodity
[03:42.070 --> 03:42.630]  industries.
[03:42.630 --> 03:45.230]  We have scientists that represent the greenhouse
[03:45.230 --> 03:48.590]  and floriculture industry, the food industry, especially
[03:48.590 --> 03:51.230]  grapes and viticulture.
[03:51.270 --> 03:53.430]  We have specialists for vegetables and potatoes,
[03:53.430 --> 03:56.070]  as well as woody ornamentals and landscape plants.
[03:56.070 --> 03:58.790]  In addition, we have cross-discipline specialists.
[03:58.790 --> 04:01.990]  We have two really wonderful plant pathologists,
[04:01.990 --> 04:05.710]  a weed scientist, and an excellent entomologist.
[04:05.710 --> 04:07.990]  And also, I supply the information
[04:07.990 --> 04:09.190]  for plant tissue culture.
[04:09.190 --> 04:12.310]  So we are kind of a one-stop shop for everything
[04:12.310 --> 04:13.710]  that our stakeholders need.
[04:13.710 --> 04:16.470]  And since they're very close to us,
[04:16.470 --> 04:20.150]  we interact with them quite a bit.
[04:20.150 --> 04:23.790]  As Luis mentioned, I do teach the plant propagation class
[04:23.790 --> 04:24.310]  at Cornell.
[04:24.310 --> 04:27.070]  It's offered this fall semester.
[04:27.070 --> 04:31.990]  And we cover all topics about propagation.
[04:31.990 --> 04:33.710]  There's not enough time in one semester,
[04:33.710 --> 04:38.870]  but we have hands-on labs in addition to the lectures
[04:38.870 --> 04:40.950]  to go along with the education.
[04:43.510 --> 04:46.150]  OK, so we're going to talk about plant propagation today.
[04:46.150 --> 04:48.670]  And then for those of you who are not aware,
[04:48.670 --> 04:50.630]  basically, all plant propagation
[04:50.630 --> 04:53.310]  is multiplying plants.
[04:53.310 --> 04:55.870]  It's figured out ways, different ways, to multiply plants,
[04:55.870 --> 04:58.750]  increase their numbers, either by sexual techniques
[04:58.750 --> 05:00.390]  or asexual techniques.
[05:00.390 --> 05:04.190]  If you're into propagation, the bottom right,
[05:04.190 --> 05:06.830]  this logo is the International Plant Propagator Society.
[05:06.830 --> 05:08.190]  You might be interested in that.
[05:08.190 --> 05:10.630]  It's a national organization, three regions
[05:10.630 --> 05:13.470]  in the United States, Eastern, Western, and Southern region.
[05:13.470 --> 05:15.870]  And their motto is to seek and share.
[05:15.910 --> 05:19.110]  And they are always very willing to share information.
[05:19.110 --> 05:21.070]  So if you really like propagation,
[05:21.070 --> 05:25.030]  you might want to consider that organization.
[05:25.030 --> 05:27.950]  But today, we're going to talk about hemp plants
[05:27.950 --> 05:29.590]  and how to propagate them.
[05:29.590 --> 05:34.790]  And they can be propagated by both sexual and asexual
[05:34.790 --> 05:35.350]  techniques.
[05:35.350 --> 05:39.510]  So today, we're going to cover three main areas, seed
[05:39.510 --> 05:42.870]  propagation for sexual propagation,
[05:42.870 --> 05:45.950]  and then two asexual propagation techniques.
[05:45.950 --> 05:49.150]  We're going to talk about vegetative cutting propagation,
[05:49.150 --> 05:53.710]  and then stem cutting, and then also micropropagation.
[05:53.710 --> 05:58.430]  So stem cutting propagation is the most commonly used
[05:58.430 --> 05:59.670]  for hemp.
[05:59.670 --> 06:02.550]  Hemp can be asexually propagated by other techniques,
[06:02.550 --> 06:07.510]  such as grafting, or layering, or other techniques.
[06:07.510 --> 06:10.430]  But for stem cutting propagation,
[06:10.430 --> 06:14.150]  that is the most convenient and most successful.
[06:14.150 --> 06:16.310]  So that's all I'm going to talk about today.
[06:16.310 --> 06:18.710]  And then we'll get into the micropropagation,
[06:18.710 --> 06:22.590]  which I'm very proud about because my graduate students,
[06:22.590 --> 06:25.030]  who I'll be showing you later, have really
[06:25.030 --> 06:29.030]  worked out a very detailed protocol for hemp plants.
[06:31.590 --> 06:33.670]  OK, so before we get into specifics,
[06:33.670 --> 06:38.310]  let's talk about some general basics for propagation.
[06:38.350 --> 06:40.510]  And one of the things to remember
[06:40.510 --> 06:44.910]  is that healthy plants produce healthy propagules.
[06:44.910 --> 06:48.670]  So you want to start off, if it's even seeds or cuttings,
[06:48.670 --> 06:51.470]  you want to start off with healthy mother plants,
[06:51.470 --> 06:53.670]  or sometimes they're called stock plants.
[06:53.670 --> 06:57.030]  This picture on the right shows a hemp plant
[06:57.030 --> 06:58.990]  that hasn't been fertilized well.
[06:58.990 --> 07:01.510]  You can see it's yellow, it's weak,
[07:01.510 --> 07:04.070]  compared to on the right, a hemp plant that's
[07:04.070 --> 07:06.230]  been well fertilized and well cared for.
[07:06.270 --> 07:09.430]  It's very strong stems would be very good to generate
[07:09.430 --> 07:12.270]  any kind of cuttings from.
[07:12.270 --> 07:14.390]  In addition to healthy stock plants,
[07:14.390 --> 07:16.910]  you need to consider the media.
[07:16.910 --> 07:19.390]  We're going to actually, when we start talking about stem
[07:19.390 --> 07:21.950]  cuttings, I'll get into media in more detail.
[07:21.950 --> 07:25.990]  But overall, you just want to have a propagation medium that
[07:25.990 --> 07:30.070]  has good drainage because you need oxygen in that medium
[07:30.070 --> 07:32.910]  so that the roots can respire well.
[07:32.910 --> 07:35.310]  The medium should be free of any kind of weed seeds
[07:35.310 --> 07:37.310]  or pathogens and insects.
[07:37.310 --> 07:39.150]  It should be able to wet very easily
[07:39.150 --> 07:40.750]  and then maintain its moisture.
[07:40.750 --> 07:43.430]  And it should also have some cation exchange capacity.
[07:43.430 --> 07:46.270]  In other words, the ability to retain some nutrients
[07:46.270 --> 07:49.470]  so that when those little plants that we're propagating
[07:49.470 --> 07:51.910]  start to grow, that they have some nutrition that
[07:51.910 --> 07:55.470]  help them grow much faster.
[07:55.470 --> 07:58.030]  And light's an important consideration with hemp
[07:58.030 --> 08:00.950]  because we know that hemp is photoperiodic.
[08:00.950 --> 08:04.830]  Under short days, flower buds will initiate,
[08:04.830 --> 08:07.310]  and then they will form and grow.
[08:07.310 --> 08:09.030]  When you want to propagate a plant,
[08:09.030 --> 08:12.590]  you want to stay away from floral plants.
[08:12.590 --> 08:17.910]  You want to stick with the vegetative stage of plant
[08:17.910 --> 08:18.390]  growth.
[08:18.390 --> 08:20.470]  And so in that situation, they should
[08:20.470 --> 08:22.390]  be growing under long days.
[08:22.390 --> 08:25.950]  And that's much better, especially for taking cuttings.
[08:25.950 --> 08:28.190]  We'll talk a little bit more about that later.
[08:28.190 --> 08:31.710]  And then intensity, of course, light intensity is important.
[08:31.750 --> 08:33.150]  Hemp like the sun.
[08:33.150 --> 08:35.350]  They grow well out in the full sun.
[08:35.350 --> 08:37.070]  When you move them inside to a greenhouse,
[08:37.070 --> 08:38.070]  they do really well.
[08:38.070 --> 08:42.190]  But if you're trying to grow them in a home environment
[08:42.190 --> 08:45.110]  without any kind of greenhouse, the light intensity
[08:45.110 --> 08:46.150]  can be quite low.
[08:46.150 --> 08:48.910]  And then the plants will stretch and not grow well.
[08:48.910 --> 08:50.430]  And then, of course, the wavelength
[08:50.430 --> 08:53.270]  that the plant's receiving, red light, far red light,
[08:53.270 --> 08:54.190]  that sort of thing.
[08:54.190 --> 08:55.830]  That's an important consideration too.
[08:55.830 --> 08:57.590]  We're not going to talk about those today,
[08:57.590 --> 09:00.750]  but these are all things to consider.
[09:00.750 --> 09:02.190]  One of the most important things
[09:02.190 --> 09:03.870]  when you're talking about propagation
[09:03.870 --> 09:05.990]  is water management and humidity,
[09:05.990 --> 09:07.550]  whether it's be seeds or cuttings,
[09:07.550 --> 09:08.750]  it doesn't really matter.
[09:08.750 --> 09:12.550]  You need to make sure that those plants have adequate water.
[09:12.550 --> 09:16.470]  And on a large scale, an intermittent mist system,
[09:16.470 --> 09:19.230]  like you see here on the left, is
[09:19.230 --> 09:22.750]  nice to use because it automatically
[09:22.750 --> 09:26.110]  will water your cuttings or your seedlings for you.
[09:26.110 --> 09:29.630]  And if you don't have that kind of system,
[09:29.630 --> 09:31.230]  you can use something very similar,
[09:31.230 --> 09:33.190]  like a plastic covered dome.
[09:33.190 --> 09:35.990]  Or even if you only have a single plant
[09:35.990 --> 09:39.070]  or a small number of plants and you want to root them,
[09:39.070 --> 09:40.870]  all you have to do is stick those cuttings
[09:40.870 --> 09:42.350]  and cover them with a plastic bag.
[09:42.350 --> 09:45.310]  And the plastic bag keeps the humidity up.
[09:45.310 --> 09:47.790]  And for cutting propagation, this
[09:47.790 --> 09:50.790]  is important because you're removing the plant,
[09:50.790 --> 09:53.470]  you're removing stem cuttings from a mother plant,
[09:53.470 --> 09:54.950]  and they have no roots.
[09:54.950 --> 09:57.150]  And so you don't want them to transpire.
[09:57.150 --> 09:58.790]  Keeping them in a high humidity, they're
[09:58.830 --> 10:02.310]  going to reduce transpiration until the new roots form
[10:02.310 --> 10:05.270]  and allow them to take up their own water from the growing
[10:05.270 --> 10:07.710]  medium.
[10:07.710 --> 10:09.830]  Temperature is an important thing with hemp.
[10:09.830 --> 10:13.070]  They do like warm temperatures.
[10:13.070 --> 10:17.070]  Generally, the rule of thumb for hemp
[10:17.070 --> 10:21.910]  is at least 73 degrees Fahrenheit up to 77.
[10:21.910 --> 10:25.270]  And oftentimes, they like much warmer temperatures.
[10:25.270 --> 10:28.470]  And when we get to the micropropagation part
[10:28.470 --> 10:31.710]  of this presentation, you'll see some temperature studies
[10:31.710 --> 10:32.270]  that we did.
[10:32.270 --> 10:35.630]  And they really do demonstrate their desire
[10:35.630 --> 10:39.550]  for warmer temperature.
[10:39.550 --> 10:43.790]  And also cleanliness, good sanitation is important.
[10:43.790 --> 10:47.710]  We can't overlook some of these basics like good sanitation.
[10:47.710 --> 10:49.870]  Using clean pots, new pots.
[10:49.870 --> 10:53.550]  If they're used pots, they should have been sanitized.
[10:53.550 --> 10:55.630]  Even inside the greenhouse, making sure
[10:55.630 --> 10:59.110]  that plant debris is removed, algae is removed,
[10:59.110 --> 10:59.830]  that sort of thing.
[10:59.830 --> 11:03.510]  Because those kinds of situations
[11:03.510 --> 11:08.430]  will encourage insects and diseases.
[11:08.430 --> 11:12.190]  So you want to make sure that your growing facility is very
[11:12.190 --> 11:15.950]  clean.
[11:15.950 --> 11:18.510]  OK, so if you're trying to decide
[11:18.510 --> 11:20.950]  whether you want to propagate your plants by seeds
[11:20.950 --> 11:23.990]  or by some form of asexual propagation,
[11:23.990 --> 11:27.270]  you should remember that hemp plants are diecious.
[11:27.270 --> 11:29.830]  So they have male flowers on one plant
[11:29.830 --> 11:31.950]  and female flowers on the other plant.
[11:31.950 --> 11:33.870]  So they occur in different plants.
[11:33.870 --> 11:36.870]  But mostly for hemp, we're concerned with
[11:36.870 --> 11:40.070]  or interested with the female flowers.
[11:40.070 --> 11:42.670]  We want them, the female flowers,
[11:42.670 --> 11:45.310]  for the different products that we want to extract.
[11:45.310 --> 11:49.790]  So remember, when you have seed propagation,
[11:49.790 --> 11:53.510]  there is genetic recombination and segregation of traits.
[11:53.510 --> 11:55.750]  And also, that means that there'll
[11:55.750 --> 11:59.390]  be male plants and female plants produced.
[11:59.390 --> 12:02.830]  So if you only want female plants, if you want clones,
[12:02.830 --> 12:04.590]  then you're going to be restricted
[12:04.590 --> 12:09.750]  to some form of vegetative propagation.
[12:09.750 --> 12:14.790]  Dr. Alan Taylor up there in Geneva at Cornell University,
[12:14.790 --> 12:16.790]  one of the other off-campus facilities,
[12:16.790 --> 12:19.990]  he's been doing a lot of work with seeds of hemp.
[12:19.990 --> 12:24.510]  This just shows you a picture of hemp seeds as an akeen.
[12:24.510 --> 12:26.910]  They're very similar to a sunflower seed,
[12:26.910 --> 12:29.670]  in case you haven't seen the seeds up close and cleaned.
[12:32.390 --> 12:35.470]  So if you're going to start with seed propagation of hemp,
[12:35.470 --> 12:38.430]  just like the basics that I covered a few minutes ago,
[12:38.430 --> 12:41.270]  you have to remember you want to start off with good, healthy
[12:41.270 --> 12:45.070]  seed, viable seed, good genetics.
[12:45.070 --> 12:46.750]  The stronger the genetics you have,
[12:46.750 --> 12:48.550]  the better the plants you're going to grow.
[12:48.550 --> 12:50.830]  You may be interested in feminized seeds
[12:50.830 --> 12:53.870]  if you want just female seeds.
[12:53.910 --> 12:57.710]  You also need to understand the growing media,
[12:57.710 --> 13:00.710]  whether it's a field that you're going to sow the seeds in
[13:00.710 --> 13:02.670]  or some kind of greenhouse media.
[13:02.670 --> 13:04.230]  That media should be well-drained,
[13:04.230 --> 13:08.350]  as I mentioned earlier, should be fairly low weed pressure
[13:08.350 --> 13:11.630]  and have plenty of nutrients available for the plants
[13:11.630 --> 13:15.390]  to grow in once they germinate and start to grow.
[13:15.390 --> 13:20.310]  If you're going to do any kind of field soil
[13:20.310 --> 13:23.230]  germination of your seeds, it's wise to do
[13:23.230 --> 13:27.990]  a soil test the season before you start planting.
[13:27.990 --> 13:29.870]  Find out if you need to adjust the pH
[13:29.870 --> 13:31.270]  or add any kind of nutrients.
[13:33.950 --> 13:36.150]  And you also should think strategically
[13:36.150 --> 13:39.030]  if you're going to plant out in the field
[13:39.030 --> 13:41.670]  so that you can maximize your environment.
[13:41.670 --> 13:43.190]  Consider a frost date, right?
[13:43.190 --> 13:45.230]  You want to plant after the last frost date
[13:45.230 --> 13:47.070]  because you don't want your seeds to come up
[13:47.070 --> 13:49.710]  and then get frosted.
[13:49.710 --> 13:52.430]  Luckily, in the spring, when the temperatures
[13:52.430 --> 13:54.670]  start to warm up, our day lengths are getting longer.
[13:54.670 --> 13:59.230]  So we have long days, and that's very, very good for hemp growth.
[13:59.230 --> 14:01.950]  And then consider the rain.
[14:01.950 --> 14:04.910]  You may want to plant your seeds a day or two
[14:04.910 --> 14:08.550]  before rain is predicted so that they get watered in really well.
[14:08.550 --> 14:10.190]  This is especially important if you don't
[14:10.190 --> 14:14.870]  have an irrigation source.
[14:14.870 --> 14:17.910]  So when you're going to propagate your seeds,
[14:17.910 --> 14:20.430]  one thing you can do to help improve your success
[14:20.430 --> 14:25.430]  is to soak the seeds in water for anywhere from 8 to 12 hours
[14:25.430 --> 14:27.470]  before you sow the seeds.
[14:27.470 --> 14:31.190]  This allows the seeds to imbibe the water
[14:31.190 --> 14:33.990]  and then start the whole germination process.
[14:33.990 --> 14:36.390]  Enzymes start breaking down things.
[14:36.390 --> 14:37.790]  Lipids and fats breaking down.
[14:37.790 --> 14:42.030]  So the whole germination process begins and gives you
[14:42.030 --> 14:43.390]  a little bit of head start.
[14:43.390 --> 14:45.630]  It sometimes makes it a little more complicated
[14:45.630 --> 14:47.510]  when you're sowing the seeds.
[14:47.550 --> 14:52.110]  But remember, soaking the seeds, pre-soaking your seeds is helpful,
[14:52.110 --> 14:54.870]  but it's really not necessary for hemp.
[14:54.870 --> 14:58.550]  And then temperature, again, is very important for seed germination.
[14:58.550 --> 15:02.270]  A minimal temperature of 65 and warmer is better.
[15:02.270 --> 15:05.670]  So anywhere over 65 degrees would be great.
[15:05.670 --> 15:10.390]  You can plant your seeds about an inch deep under the median.
[15:10.390 --> 15:16.070]  Small, back in 2016, had a paper showing that hemp seeds did not
[15:16.070 --> 15:18.230]  matter if it was light or dark conditions.
[15:18.230 --> 15:22.950]  So they don't seem to be affected by light or the absence of light.
[15:22.950 --> 15:25.830]  And then lastly, don't forget, very important,
[15:25.830 --> 15:29.790]  that once you get your seeds sown, make sure you water them thoroughly
[15:29.790 --> 15:35.910]  because this starts the germination process and will get them going.
[15:35.910 --> 15:38.950]  They have good water source.
[15:38.950 --> 15:43.190]  Dr. Taylor and his team up in Geneva did some work with seed size
[15:43.190 --> 15:47.510]  and found out that larger seeds will have a better germination rate
[15:47.510 --> 15:48.950]  than the smaller seeds.
[15:48.950 --> 15:52.630]  So when you're, especially if you're involved with breeding,
[15:52.630 --> 15:55.390]  you might look at your seedling offsprings and see,
[15:55.390 --> 15:59.270]  you know, you can just visually tell if they're going to be good germinators
[15:59.270 --> 16:02.590]  or not just by the size of the seeds.
[16:02.590 --> 16:07.710]  They also did a bunch of work with storing seeds
[16:07.710 --> 16:12.350]  and found that really hemp seeds do not have a long storage life.
[16:12.430 --> 16:17.430]  About a year and a half is best for them to be stored.
[16:17.430 --> 16:21.390]  And after that, their viability decreases very significantly.
[16:21.390 --> 16:24.510]  So if you're producing hemp seed,
[16:24.510 --> 16:30.370]  make sure that you use it within a year, year and a half.
[16:30.370 --> 16:36.050]  OK, if you're more interested in producing clones,
[16:36.050 --> 16:39.370]  then we're going to look at vegetative propagation.
[16:39.370 --> 16:42.290]  And this is a way that you can get clones.
[16:42.610 --> 16:47.210]  They are an exact copy of the plant from which they were taken.
[16:47.210 --> 16:51.090]  This maintains their genetic characteristics as well as their phenotype.
[16:51.090 --> 16:55.490]  So if you wanted only female plants,
[16:55.490 --> 16:59.010]  you can get only female plants if that's what you propagate from.
[16:59.010 --> 17:02.650]  And the other advantage of vegetative propagation is that you can get
[17:02.650 --> 17:06.890]  many cuttings from a single plant.
[17:06.890 --> 17:09.250]  And as I mentioned, you can get all female plants, too,
[17:09.250 --> 17:11.930]  if that's what your objective is.
[17:11.930 --> 17:15.930]  Your cuttings, when you vegetatively propagate a hemp plant,
[17:15.930 --> 17:20.170]  can be very uniform, which is helpful for doing research
[17:20.170 --> 17:22.370]  as well as just for your growing purposes.
[17:22.370 --> 17:24.010]  And it's low cost.
[17:24.010 --> 17:27.170]  Now, I won't say it's less expensive than seed propagation
[17:27.170 --> 17:30.370]  because seed propagation is the least expensive.
[17:30.370 --> 17:33.370]  But remember, if you go with seed propagation,
[17:33.370 --> 17:36.730]  you don't necessarily get all female plants.
[17:36.730 --> 17:40.050]  Here, if you asexually propagate a plant,
[17:40.050 --> 17:41.210]  you're going to get clones.
[17:41.210 --> 17:45.490]  And that's what a lot of people are looking for.
[17:45.490 --> 17:51.330]  In addition, if you take cuttings and get clones through vegetative propagation,
[17:51.330 --> 17:54.410]  your plants are going to be stronger and they're going to kind of have a head start
[17:54.410 --> 17:57.170]  compared to seedlings, which are weak when they start,
[17:57.170 --> 17:59.050]  when they germinate and they start to grow.
[17:59.050 --> 18:01.170]  Clones come from mature plants.
[18:01.170 --> 18:06.850]  And once they get the roots in 10 to 14 days, they're ready to go.
[18:06.850 --> 18:09.930]  The other nice thing about vegetative propagation is that you can
[18:09.930 --> 18:14.410]  if you have a greenhouse or some kind of indoor production facility,
[18:14.410 --> 18:16.210]  you can get year round production.
[18:19.010 --> 18:22.330]  So we're going to talk primarily about stem cuttings today.
[18:22.330 --> 18:27.730]  This is the most common approach to vegetatively propagate hemp plants.
[18:27.730 --> 18:32.850]  And basically, a cutting is just a piece of the plant that has been removed
[18:32.850 --> 18:38.010]  from the mother plant and then given the opportunity to make its own roots
[18:38.010 --> 18:40.410]  and grow as an individual plant.
[18:40.410 --> 18:42.450]  This is one way you can get a clone.
[18:42.450 --> 18:49.480]  It's the identical plant as the stock plant from which it was taken.
[18:49.480 --> 18:54.160]  Very simple, you don't need any high tech tools to propagate plants.
[18:54.160 --> 18:59.160]  Basically, a sharp knife or some sharp clippers or a razor blade,
[18:59.160 --> 19:02.160]  they can all be used to take your cuttings.
[19:02.160 --> 19:08.000]  Remember that your tools should be clean and disinfested simply with maybe a 95%
[19:08.040 --> 19:14.200]  ethanol or a bleach solution if you're worried that they were used for
[19:14.200 --> 19:16.680]  on other plants that may have carried diseases.
[19:18.240 --> 19:21.480]  We're going to talk about a propagation medium in a minute,
[19:21.480 --> 19:22.480]  but we'll need a medium.
[19:22.480 --> 19:24.320]  You need a rooting hormone.
[19:24.320 --> 19:32.080]  We're recommending Hormone 1 or any of the brands that have about 0.1% IBA.
[19:32.080 --> 19:33.920]  That's about a thousand parts per million.
[19:34.920 --> 19:39.760]  These other rooting hormones, they come in stronger concentrations.
[19:39.760 --> 19:45.600]  Here, you can see it's 0.3 or 3,000 parts per million or 8,000 parts per million.
[19:45.600 --> 19:49.400]  You don't really need that level of auxin.
[19:49.400 --> 19:55.280]  A very low 1,000 parts per million level is fine for rooting hemp cuttings.
[19:55.280 --> 19:59.000]  And then you'll need some kind of technique to keep your plants moist,
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.440]  either humidity dome or an intermittent mist system.
[20:02.520 --> 20:06.000]  And then you want to take your clones from mature plants.
[20:06.000 --> 20:12.160]  These are plants at least two months old, just as a general rule of thumb.
[20:12.160 --> 20:15.360]  You don't want to take cuttings from very young, immature plants because the
[20:15.360 --> 20:18.800]  cuttings are going to be weak, that you won't get strong plants from them.
[20:18.800 --> 20:23.560]  And also a mature plant, a larger plant is going to give you many more cuttings
[20:23.560 --> 20:26.280]  than a small plant will do.
[20:29.830 --> 20:36.070]  So remembering that hemp is a photoperiodic plant, you want to,
[20:36.070 --> 20:39.430]  and also remembering that you want to take your cuttings from healthy plants,
[20:39.430 --> 20:43.670]  you want to make sure that they're not in flower.
[20:43.670 --> 20:50.670]  Now, it's not impossible to take cuttings from a flowering hemp plant.
[20:50.670 --> 20:56.830]  In fact, my very first experience some years ago was to take cuttings from
[20:57.830 --> 21:04.190]  flowering hemp plants, clones that from Dr. Smart's breeding program up there,
[21:04.190 --> 21:08.150]  he wanted to take some cuttings and they worked fine.
[21:08.150 --> 21:11.830]  And all you have to do, all you have to remember when you're taking cuttings
[21:11.830 --> 21:17.390]  from flowering plants is that the cutting should be placed under long days.
[21:17.390 --> 21:21.670]  So, you know, take them to the greenhouse, make sure the lights are on at least
[21:21.670 --> 21:26.990]  16 hours a day, and this will help the process of rooting.
[21:26.990 --> 21:30.830]  And also it would help to remove the flower buds and any seeds that are on there.
[21:30.830 --> 21:36.430]  That way all the energy from that cutting is going to root formation.
[21:36.430 --> 21:41.590]  But if you want to make your life easy, just take your cuttings from vegetative plants
[21:41.590 --> 21:44.750]  and they will root very readily for you.
[21:44.750 --> 21:48.510]  And don't forget, I have a little asterisk down here, don't forget to label your cuttings.
[21:48.510 --> 21:54.150]  If you're taking cuttings from different cultivars or different kinds of hemp plants,
[21:54.150 --> 21:58.590]  make sure you label them because once they start growing, if you don't have labels,
[21:58.590 --> 22:03.310]  you might forget which ones you have.
[22:03.310 --> 22:08.470]  So Dr. James Faust down at Clemson University has been doing some work with Alex Carver
[22:08.470 --> 22:13.630]  on nutrition of hemp plants, and they have an interesting study here.
[22:13.630 --> 22:18.110]  They were looking at stock plants that were fertilized with three different levels
[22:18.190 --> 22:22.230]  of nitrogen, 100, 200, and 300 parts per million.
[22:22.230 --> 22:28.550]  And briefly what they found is that stock plants that were receiving the higher levels
[22:28.550 --> 22:34.870]  of fertilizer, the 200 and 300 parts per million nitrogen, grew much better, much stronger
[22:34.870 --> 22:41.590]  plants and then produced more cuttings than a plant that received either no nutrition
[22:41.590 --> 22:43.390]  or very low nutrition.
[22:46.300 --> 22:52.100]  When you're taking your cuttings, it's best to choose the apical cuttings from the stock
[22:52.100 --> 22:53.380]  plants.
[22:53.380 --> 22:56.660]  That doesn't mean that nodal cuttings won't work.
[22:56.660 --> 23:01.380]  It just means that apical cuttings, they have a growing point, they're ready to go.
[23:01.380 --> 23:06.600]  Once the roots are formed, they just take off and grow quickly.
[23:06.600 --> 23:13.140]  So generally we recommend apical cuttings and having at least two or three nodes on
[23:13.140 --> 23:14.140]  the plants.
[23:14.140 --> 23:21.180]  And generally, if they're, depending on your plant, it's about a cutting of about five
[23:21.180 --> 23:27.290]  inches up to eight inches in length.
[23:27.290 --> 23:31.210]  Once you take your cutting, just like any other plant, you want to remove any of the
[23:31.210 --> 23:36.690]  lower leaves on that cutting, on the section of the cutting that's going to be below the
[23:36.690 --> 23:37.970]  propagation medium.
[23:37.970 --> 23:41.530]  Because if there are leaves down there and you stick it in the propagation medium, it's
[23:41.530 --> 23:48.090]  a wet moist medium, there's a good chance that those leaves will rot anyways.
[23:48.090 --> 23:51.730]  So just remove them before you stick your cuttings.
[23:51.730 --> 23:58.570]  And if you have a situation where the leaves on the top of the plant are very large and
[23:58.570 --> 24:03.370]  you know, they cause the cutting to flop over because of the weight, don't be afraid to
[24:03.370 --> 24:06.490]  take your scissors and trim those leaves off.
[24:06.490 --> 24:07.490]  Okay.
[24:07.490 --> 24:13.570]  Trimming the leaves down a little bit so that you have more manageable space is not going
[24:13.570 --> 24:15.650]  to hurt that cutting.
[24:15.650 --> 24:21.650]  We know that, you know, leaves on a cutting do help that cutting root, but you're not
[24:21.650 --> 24:25.530]  removing the leaves by any means, you're just cutting, reducing them by one third or one
[24:25.530 --> 24:26.530]  half.
[24:26.530 --> 24:34.330]  So take off the lower leaves and trim the larger leaves if necessary.
[24:34.330 --> 24:36.770]  And then you want to gently wound the bottom of the cutting.
[24:37.050 --> 24:43.410]  Again, this is one of those things that is not 100% necessary for success, but it's definitely
[24:43.410 --> 24:48.890]  going to increase the speed of rooting by just taking your knife and making a slight
[24:48.890 --> 24:50.850]  wound.
[24:50.850 --> 24:55.330]  Sometimes that process of just removing the lower leaves, when you break that petiole
[24:55.330 --> 25:00.130]  off the stem, that's enough wounding for the cutting to succeed.
[25:00.130 --> 25:02.770]  And then you want to treat it with a rooting powder.
[25:02.770 --> 25:07.370]  We're recommending about a 0.1% IBA, that's a thousand part per million, as I mentioned
[25:07.370 --> 25:08.370]  earlier.
[25:08.370 --> 25:12.490]  So you would take your cutting, wound it, dip it in some water, and then dip it into
[25:12.490 --> 25:18.570]  your rooting powder, and then take that cutting that has the hormone on it and stick it into
[25:18.570 --> 25:20.050]  the rooting medium.
[25:20.050 --> 25:30.570]  Again, Dr. Faust and Alex Carver did some work on auxins, and they looked at IBA and
[25:30.770 --> 25:37.290]  NAA, two different auxins at four different levels, either none, 2,000, 4,000, to 6,000
[25:37.290 --> 25:38.850]  parts per million.
[25:38.850 --> 25:44.770]  And they found out that the best rooting was at about 2,000 to 4,000 parts per million,
[25:44.770 --> 25:48.450]  either IBA or NAA.
[25:48.450 --> 25:54.330]  And you might notice or might remember that this 2,000 parts per million is about twice
[25:54.330 --> 25:56.770]  the amount that I recommended earlier.
[25:56.770 --> 26:02.530]  But there is a difference because in this research at Clemson, they were using a liquid
[26:02.530 --> 26:03.530]  dip.
[26:03.530 --> 26:07.250]  In other words, that's the auxin that was dissolved into water.
[26:07.250 --> 26:12.290]  And then previously, when I was talking about the 1,000 parts per million, I was referring
[26:12.290 --> 26:15.450]  to a powder dip.
[26:15.450 --> 26:20.490]  So there is a difference based on the application procedure.
[26:20.490 --> 26:24.850]  And also on their research, they looked at seven different cultivars, and they found
[26:24.930 --> 26:30.890]  out that there were differences amongst the cultivars as far as the results of this research,
[26:30.890 --> 26:38.050]  which makes sense because we all know that genetics play an important part of how plants
[26:38.050 --> 26:39.370]  react.
[26:39.370 --> 26:44.770]  And so we would expect that some cultivars would root better at some levels, and some
[26:44.770 --> 26:49.970]  cultivars would root worse.
[26:50.090 --> 26:56.730]  So earlier I mentioned propagation medium, and this is a very confusing discussion for
[26:56.730 --> 27:02.330]  a lot of people because they don't, you know, if you go online and look for rooting medium,
[27:02.330 --> 27:03.850]  these are the options that you have.
[27:03.850 --> 27:08.650]  And it could be overwhelming if you're not very familiar with propagation.
[27:08.650 --> 27:14.570]  But here, you know, in the top center, here's your basic 50-50 medium of peat moss and perlite.
[27:14.570 --> 27:16.170]  It's an industry standard.
[27:16.170 --> 27:19.370]  People love that for rooting almost any kind of cutting.
[27:19.370 --> 27:21.210]  But it doesn't need to be perlite.
[27:21.210 --> 27:23.650]  You could be perlite, it could be vermiculite, as you see here.
[27:23.650 --> 27:27.290]  Those are both components that give you good drainage.
[27:27.290 --> 27:32.850]  That's why you have a 50-50 peat moss and whatever, because the peat moss offers the
[27:32.850 --> 27:38.810]  water retention where the perlite or the vermiculite will give you good drainage.
[27:38.810 --> 27:41.130]  There are other lot of different options out there too.
[27:41.130 --> 27:45.210]  In the top right are these Jiffy pellets, which are great.
[27:45.210 --> 27:49.650]  You soak them in water for a short period of time, and then you stick your seed or your
[27:49.650 --> 27:50.650]  cutting in it.
[27:50.650 --> 27:58.690]  Oasis foam, the nowadays coconut core is a very common propagation tool.
[27:58.690 --> 28:03.490]  We've tested that in our propagation class and found coconut core to be very, very good
[28:03.490 --> 28:06.730]  because of the drainage, if it's managed right.
[28:06.730 --> 28:15.730]  Campbell et al. back in 2021 found that rockwool in their situation offered a 7 to 13 times
[28:15.730 --> 28:21.210]  improvement over the next best rooting medium.
[28:21.210 --> 28:30.170]  So it's best if you try different options for your rooting and find out which works
[28:30.170 --> 28:32.610]  best for your situation.
[28:32.610 --> 28:39.610]  It makes a difference on how humid your plant is or how humid your greenhouse is, your watering
[28:39.610 --> 28:42.290]  techniques, that sort of thing.
[28:42.290 --> 28:51.650]  But these are all feasible techniques that you can stick your cuttings.
[28:51.650 --> 28:58.570]  And as we mentioned before, high humidity is very important once you stick your cuttings
[28:58.570 --> 29:03.130]  because again, those cuttings don't have any roots.
[29:03.130 --> 29:07.010]  They're not able to take water up from the roots and from the medium.
[29:07.010 --> 29:11.730]  So you want to make sure that the leaves stay moist and they stay turgid.
[29:11.730 --> 29:15.730]  The stomates remain closed so they don't transpire.
[29:15.730 --> 29:21.570]  And like the seeds, you could use a plastic dome if you wanted to, or just a plastic bag,
[29:21.570 --> 29:32.100]  or the intermittent mist is a very good automatic system, which is used worldwide successfully.
[29:32.100 --> 29:39.140]  And the temperature for hemp cuttings, generally on the warmer side of around 75 degrees plus
[29:39.140 --> 29:45.740]  or minus, 72 at the lowest.
[29:45.740 --> 29:51.180]  And then a lot of people prefer to use some kind of root zone heating.
[29:51.180 --> 29:55.460]  As you see here in the bottom, there's heat mats, all kinds of different heat mats and
[29:55.460 --> 29:57.460]  heat systems that you can use.
[29:57.460 --> 30:01.940]  But generally, remember, it's the root temperature.
[30:01.940 --> 30:06.420]  It's the medium temperature that's more important than the air temperature.
[30:06.420 --> 30:11.020]  So if you want to save some money on heating your greenhouse, don't worry about keeping
[30:11.020 --> 30:13.020]  the greenhouse warm.
[30:13.020 --> 30:17.300]  Just worry about keeping the roots of those plants warm.
[30:17.420 --> 30:22.860]  And either these heating mats are possible, or some greenhouses, they run their heating
[30:22.860 --> 30:27.660]  pipes underneath the benches so that the benches are warmer than the air.
[30:27.660 --> 30:32.540]  So temperature is very important with hemp because they do like it warm.
[30:32.540 --> 30:39.420]  Okay, so let's move into the last part of this discussion.
[30:39.420 --> 30:45.260]  We're going to talk about micropropagation, which is a part of plant tissue culture.
[30:45.260 --> 30:49.460]  Plant tissue culture, if you're not familiar, is just essentially growing plants on some
[30:49.460 --> 30:54.820]  kind of a sterile nutrient medium in vitro under controlled conditions.
[30:54.820 --> 30:58.300]  There are a lot of different things you can do with plant tissue culture.
[30:58.300 --> 31:03.740]  For us breeders, you know, we use embryo rescue, we use mutation breeding, we use antherculture,
[31:03.740 --> 31:06.820]  we use all kinds of things you can do with tissue culture.
[31:06.820 --> 31:12.020]  But for this discussion today for hemp, we're going to talk about micropropagation, which
[31:12.020 --> 31:16.300]  essentially like taking stem cuttings that I previously talked about.
[31:16.300 --> 31:23.020]  But in this situation, the plants are in a sterile environment in vitro.
[31:23.020 --> 31:27.620]  These are the graduate students that worked on this project.
[31:27.620 --> 31:32.820]  We're very happy that our paper has been accepted into Hort Science.
[31:32.820 --> 31:36.140]  It's either going to be published next month or the following month.
[31:36.140 --> 31:39.580]  We're going to have the cover of the Hort Science issue.
[31:40.380 --> 31:42.300]  This is Victor Zayas from left to right.
[31:42.300 --> 31:48.100]  Victor Zayas is a PhD student, Connor Stephen, who got his master's as well as Andre Gallick,
[31:48.100 --> 31:49.100]  who got his master's.
[31:49.100 --> 31:50.100]  They're both gone.
[31:50.100 --> 31:54.340]  Victor is still in the laboratory.
[31:54.340 --> 31:59.900]  So why would you decide to use micropropagation instead of one of the previous techniques?
[31:59.900 --> 32:07.140]  Well, like stem cutting propagation, clonal propagation is very important.
[32:07.140 --> 32:13.140]  This is the way you're going to get identical plants to the mother plants, clones, right?
[32:13.140 --> 32:17.660]  You're also going to have very clean, vigorous plant material if they're grown in a sterile
[32:17.660 --> 32:18.660]  environment.
[32:18.660 --> 32:19.660]  They don't have fungi.
[32:19.660 --> 32:22.020]  They don't have bacteria.
[32:22.020 --> 32:25.420]  You can grow a lot of plants in a very small space.
[32:25.420 --> 32:28.420]  So it's very efficient for space utilization.
[32:28.420 --> 32:30.620]  Large numbers, small space, that's great.
[32:30.620 --> 32:33.140]  That makes for high efficiency and high profits.
[32:33.140 --> 32:35.140]  And it's also less maintenance.
[32:35.140 --> 32:40.900]  Instead of hauling around 10 gallon pots or five gallon pots that are heavy and cumbersome,
[32:40.900 --> 32:46.420]  you're working in a laboratory with very small items.
[32:46.420 --> 32:51.140]  And just like with the stem cutting propagation, if you had a greenhouse, you could do it all
[32:51.140 --> 32:52.140]  year round.
[32:52.140 --> 32:56.420]  In a tissue culture lab, again, you do that all year round too, because it's a controlled
[32:56.420 --> 32:57.420]  environment.
[32:57.420 --> 33:01.060]  The plants don't care if it's snowing outside or not.
[33:02.060 --> 33:06.500]  And we can consider our plants to be disease free.
[33:06.500 --> 33:12.240]  Remember just by stage one of micropropagation, which we'll talk about in a minute, it cleans
[33:12.240 --> 33:15.540]  off all the fungi and the bacteria.
[33:15.540 --> 33:19.540]  We're not sure about viruses, but you can have your plants tested.
[33:19.540 --> 33:24.220]  And if they are virus free, when you put them into tissue culture, they will continue to
[33:24.220 --> 33:25.580]  be virus free.
[33:25.580 --> 33:31.020]  So then you have a totally pathogen free plant, which is one of the big advantages for micropropagation.
[33:31.980 --> 33:42.300]  So these are the stages of micropropagation that our team worked on for the last two years.
[33:42.300 --> 33:49.300]  We kind of used, we used one cultivar, the TJCBD, and we looked at all different stages
[33:49.300 --> 33:51.380]  and multiple aspects of each stage.
[33:51.380 --> 33:59.780]  So stage zero is growing a healthy stock plant, a healthy mother plant, hopefully it's free
[33:59.940 --> 34:05.740]  from insects and diseases as possible, growing well in a well lit location with plenty of
[34:05.740 --> 34:07.980]  nutrients.
[34:07.980 --> 34:14.260]  Stage one is where you introduce your plant material from the whole plant into in vitro
[34:14.260 --> 34:19.140]  and let them grow aseptically.
[34:19.140 --> 34:25.980]  Stage two is the multiplication phase when you're increasing numbers of plants.
[34:25.980 --> 34:31.820]  This is a situation where normally in a commercial laboratory, they would subculture these every
[34:31.820 --> 34:32.820]  four weeks.
[34:32.820 --> 34:37.780]  They would take these plants out of the culture vessel, chop them up into a number of new
[34:37.780 --> 34:44.020]  plants and then reintroduce them into new vessels on fresh medium.
[34:44.020 --> 34:48.620]  And then lastly, stage three and four is rooting and acclimation.
[34:48.620 --> 34:50.980]  I'll give you a spoiler alert.
[34:50.980 --> 34:55.520]  Our final conclusions found out that we don't really need stage three with hemp.
[34:56.060 --> 35:00.160]  You can go directly from stage two to stage four, but I'll show you why we came to that
[35:00.160 --> 35:03.520]  conclusion.
[35:03.520 --> 35:07.440]  So these are the different things that we examined in our paper.
[35:07.440 --> 35:09.840]  I'm not going to show data or anything like that.
[35:09.840 --> 35:15.560]  If you want to get more detailed, email me and I can send you a copy of the paper or
[35:15.560 --> 35:18.800]  wait, it's going to, like I said, it's going to be in HortScience either next month or
[35:18.800 --> 35:19.800]  the month after.
[35:19.800 --> 35:24.560]  But we looked at the nutrients that the plants were receiving.
[35:24.600 --> 35:29.440]  We looked at the sugars that they received, the gelling agents that made it a semi-solid
[35:29.440 --> 35:36.400]  compound, and then also the plant growth regulators that they received in the medium.
[35:36.400 --> 35:42.000]  And then we also looked at the explant type, what kind of cuttings that we took off the
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.040]  mother plant.
[35:43.040 --> 35:49.320]  We looked at the temperature that they were grown in as well as the pH of the medium.
[35:49.320 --> 35:54.680]  So stage one can be complicated for some people.
[35:54.680 --> 35:59.280]  And we've had a lot of people contact us saying they just can't get their plant material in
[35:59.280 --> 36:00.280]  vitro.
[36:00.280 --> 36:07.100]  So we set up these studies and, you know, common old household bleach is used to clean
[36:07.100 --> 36:09.600]  off plant materials for stage one.
[36:09.600 --> 36:12.440]  Nowadays, bleach comes in different concentrations.
[36:12.440 --> 36:20.920]  We used a 7.5% sodium hypochlorite and we did 20%, 40%, and 60% levels for 10 minutes.
[36:20.920 --> 36:28.040]  And then we use these treatments with plants that were removed from either the greenhouse
[36:28.040 --> 36:33.880]  up here or from a growth chamber situation, just to see what kind of results we would
[36:33.880 --> 36:35.200]  get.
[36:35.920 --> 36:44.360]  Well, it was very interesting that all the cuttings that we took from plants that were
[36:44.360 --> 36:49.560]  grown in a growth chamber, it didn't matter if it was 20%, 40%, or 60% bleach, they were
[36:49.560 --> 36:51.600]  almost all clean.
[36:51.600 --> 36:58.280]  Whereas the cuttings that we took from plants grown in the greenhouse were almost all contaminated,
[36:58.280 --> 37:02.560]  which kind of makes sense because greenhouse plants are dirtier, there's a lot of different
[37:02.600 --> 37:08.040]  fungi, bacteria, you know, different kinds of pathogens in a greenhouse than there is
[37:08.040 --> 37:09.520]  in a growth chamber.
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.560]  So we concluded that plant material that's grown in a growth chamber has a much better
[37:13.560 --> 37:17.560]  success chance for success than plants that are grown in a greenhouse.
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.440]  And even though we didn't examine it in this study, we can also pretty confidently conclude
[37:23.440 --> 37:29.200]  that if either one of these techniques is better than taking plant material from a field,
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.400]  from field plants, because field grown plants are really dirty.
[37:33.400 --> 37:38.400]  So if you want to increase your chance of success, use stock plants that are in a protected
[37:38.400 --> 37:40.880]  area like a growth chamber.
[37:40.880 --> 37:46.440]  We also found out that it didn't matter if we use 20% or 60% bleach, they all worked
[37:46.440 --> 37:48.800]  on plants that were grown from a growth chamber.
[37:48.800 --> 37:51.200]  So they all worked well.
[37:51.200 --> 37:58.440]  And interestingly, even the highest concentration, the 60% of bleach did not damage the plant
[37:58.680 --> 37:59.680]  material.
[37:59.680 --> 38:03.760]  It suggests that we could even if we wanted to use a hundred, you know, higher levels
[38:03.760 --> 38:05.640]  of bleach, 100% maybe.
[38:05.640 --> 38:07.120]  We didn't try that.
[38:07.120 --> 38:15.040]  But at 60% bleach, no damage kind of tells us that hemp are pretty tolerant of bleach.
[38:15.040 --> 38:17.760]  For stage two, we had several experiments.
[38:17.760 --> 38:19.720]  One was looking at nutrient medium.
[38:19.720 --> 38:25.960]  Here we compared Mirashugi and Skoog medium, which is kind of the industry standard MS
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.760]  to Linsmeyer Skoog DKW medium, as well as Lloyd and McCown's WPM medium.
[38:32.760 --> 38:39.320]  And essentially, there was no difference between the MS, LS, or the DKW medium.
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.080]  Hemp plants seem to grow well in any one of those three.
[38:43.080 --> 38:47.720]  However, plants grown in WPM medium just were not healthy.
[38:47.720 --> 38:49.880]  They did not grow well.
[38:49.880 --> 38:57.560]  WPM medium is used for a lot of the ericaceous plants, rhododendrons, mountain laurels, heaths
[38:57.560 --> 38:59.680]  and heathers, that sort of thing.
[38:59.680 --> 39:02.480]  Their nitrogen requirements are different.
[39:02.480 --> 39:05.640]  And so the nitrogen levels in WPM are different.
[39:05.640 --> 39:11.400]  And that must be the reason why hemp was not very happy there.
[39:11.400 --> 39:14.240]  We also looked at cytokinins.
[39:14.240 --> 39:20.840]  The two commercial cytokinins, BA and 2IP, were our primary interest.
[39:20.840 --> 39:27.240]  But we also checked…we also trialed thiazurone, which has cytokinin-like activity.
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.360]  Because again, if you look online at papers and comments that people make, they say that
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.320]  they've used thiazurone successfully.
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.960]  But we used all three of these cytokinins at 1, 5, and 10 micromole levels.
[39:41.960 --> 39:49.840]  And here you can see that the plants did very well with BA and 2IP.
[39:49.840 --> 39:52.520]  And thiazurone was interesting.
[39:52.520 --> 39:56.920]  If you looked at the fresh weight, the plants grown with thiazurone had a greater fresh
[39:56.920 --> 39:57.920]  weight.
[39:57.920 --> 40:00.040]  And they also had the greater number of nodes.
[40:00.040 --> 40:08.720]  Like here on the bottom right of these two, you can see many, many dozens of shoots.
[40:08.760 --> 40:12.760]  And you might think, well, then this must be the best medium because it has the most
[40:12.760 --> 40:14.080]  number of shoots.
[40:14.080 --> 40:15.680]  Well, it's not.
[40:15.680 --> 40:17.560]  They're not healthy shoots.
[40:17.560 --> 40:18.560]  They're shorter.
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.560]  They're compact.
[40:19.560 --> 40:22.240]  They don't have as many nodes.
[40:22.240 --> 40:28.360]  And maybe the biggest problem with using thiazurone is that it produces callus tissue.
[40:28.360 --> 40:33.160]  If you want to micropropagate a plant, you want to avoid callus, because callus production
[40:33.160 --> 40:37.800]  will increase your chance of a spontaneous mutation very high.
[40:37.880 --> 40:40.560]  So you want to avoid callus at all costs.
[40:40.560 --> 40:46.280]  So we're recommending that you use either the BA or the 2IP as your cytokine when you're
[40:46.280 --> 40:55.400]  micropropagating hemp at the lower levels, and it works very well.
[40:55.400 --> 41:01.080]  We also looked at sugar levels from zero sugar all the way up to 60 grams per liter sugar.
[41:01.080 --> 41:03.820]  The industry standard is about 30 grams per liter.
[41:03.820 --> 41:08.660]  Most people who use an MS medium use 30 grams per liter sugar.
[41:08.660 --> 41:14.140]  But we found in these studies that both 15 grams per liter and 30 grams per liter produced
[41:14.140 --> 41:21.580]  equally nice plants, the same kind of high fresh weight and length and shoot production.
[41:21.580 --> 41:28.340]  In addition, the 15 grams per liter of the lower level showed less hyperhydricity.
[41:28.340 --> 41:34.380]  So we're recommending either 15 or 30 grams per liter of sugar, especially if you're going
[41:34.380 --> 41:36.340]  to do the 15 grams per liter.
[41:36.340 --> 41:41.780]  You'd have to stick to a four-week subculture cycle, because after four weeks, that sugar
[41:41.780 --> 41:44.700]  is used up.
[41:44.700 --> 41:47.140]  We also looked at gelling agents.
[41:47.140 --> 41:52.260]  We looked at agar, which is commonly used, comparing it to a gel and gum that's like
[41:52.260 --> 41:57.580]  a phytogel or gel right, some of the commercial names, and then also a 50-50 mix of the agar
[41:57.820 --> 41:58.820]  and the gel.
[41:58.820 --> 42:00.580]  And essentially, we didn't find any differences.
[42:00.580 --> 42:04.260]  So any one of these could be used.
[42:04.260 --> 42:09.180]  We also looked at pH in the medium, all the way from a low acidic pH of four, all the
[42:09.180 --> 42:10.940]  way up to seven.
[42:10.940 --> 42:17.660]  Typically most people using Moorish-Huggins-Kug medium have about a 5.8 pH.
[42:17.660 --> 42:20.700]  And we found that 5.8 and higher were fine.
[42:20.700 --> 42:22.060]  There were no differences.
[42:22.060 --> 42:27.460]  They still produced good, healthy plants, good fresh weight.
[42:27.460 --> 42:33.660]  And so we're recommending just stick with the 5.8, because that's what most labs use
[42:33.660 --> 42:34.660]  anyways.
[42:34.660 --> 42:36.220]  But you could go higher if you wanted to.
[42:36.220 --> 42:40.620]  But there's no advantages to going higher.
[42:40.620 --> 42:45.700]  In a very interesting experiment that we did, we looked at temperature from as low as 72
[42:45.700 --> 42:48.420]  degrees up to 82 degrees.
[42:48.420 --> 42:54.460]  And it was very clear that the warmer temperatures, the two warmer temperatures, 79 and 82, the
[42:54.460 --> 42:56.220]  plants did much, much better.
[42:56.220 --> 42:57.720]  They grew faster.
[42:57.720 --> 43:02.900]  They did significant fresh weight increase and very well.
[43:02.900 --> 43:14.920]  So you should remember to keep your plants in vitro at least about 79 degrees or warmer.
[43:14.920 --> 43:16.960]  For stage three, we looked at auxins.
[43:16.960 --> 43:27.200]  We looked at NAA and IBA at different levels and at 2.5, 0.5, or 0.25 micromole.
[43:27.200 --> 43:34.800]  And we're recommending the IBA for best shoot growth at the 2.5 micromole level.
[43:34.800 --> 43:36.320]  NAA did well.
[43:36.320 --> 43:39.440]  They rooted well and so, but there was callus produced.
[43:39.440 --> 43:45.320]  And again, as I mentioned earlier, we want to avoid callus if possible.
[43:45.320 --> 43:50.800]  And then into stage four, the acclimation stage, which is very important because micropropagated
[43:50.800 --> 43:56.240]  plants don't have any waxy cuticle on the leaves and you don't want them to desiccate.
[43:56.240 --> 44:02.040]  We compared two systems, the intermittent mist system in the greenhouse versus just
[44:02.040 --> 44:04.360]  a regular plastic dome.
[44:04.360 --> 44:15.920]  And then we doubled this experiment and used either with external application of auxin
[44:15.920 --> 44:18.040]  or no auxin.
[44:18.040 --> 44:23.920]  And we found out that the dome definitely did better than the intermittent mist.
[44:23.920 --> 44:28.480]  It's probably because of the amount of water that was present on the leaves, but the dome
[44:28.480 --> 44:32.120]  plants did well and auxins did okay.
[44:32.160 --> 44:37.960]  But there was no significant advantage to using auxins over non-auxins.
[44:37.960 --> 44:42.380]  So save the time, save the labor, save the money, and don't use an auxin.
[44:42.380 --> 44:47.120]  But if it makes you feel better, go ahead and use it, but no advantage.
[44:47.120 --> 44:53.360]  So in summary, just make sure you have good, clean environments for the mother plants.
[44:53.360 --> 44:55.120]  You can use a variety of media.
[44:55.120 --> 44:57.900]  Stay away from WPM media.
[44:57.900 --> 45:00.620]  You can use as low as 15 grams per liter sucrose.
[45:00.620 --> 45:03.140]  30 grams is probably fine.
[45:03.140 --> 45:07.100]  Keep your temperatures warmer side, 26 to 28.
[45:07.100 --> 45:11.100]  There are different cytokines you can use that seem to work fine.
[45:11.100 --> 45:13.020]  And stage three is not necessary.
[45:13.020 --> 45:15.940]  You can go directly from stage two to stage four.
[45:15.940 --> 45:20.500]  And even though we found good results with IBA, it's really not necessary.
[45:20.500 --> 45:24.660]  And then when you want to harden them off, plastic domes seem to do a better job than
[45:24.660 --> 45:27.740]  an intermittent mist system.
[45:28.580 --> 45:35.180]  And as I mentioned earlier, auxins help, but they're not necessary for that stage four.
[45:35.180 --> 45:39.300]  And lastly, the gelling agent and pH appear to have little impact on the growth of tissue
[45:39.300 --> 45:42.140]  culture plants.
[45:42.140 --> 45:46.740]  So I'm close to my 45 minutes here, so I'll stop here.
[45:46.740 --> 45:52.740]  I just want to, again, recognize the students who did the majority of the work for this,
[45:52.740 --> 45:54.900]  Connor, Victor, and Andre.
[45:54.900 --> 45:58.340]  And then we also had an undergrad, Victoria Zhang, that helped us.
[45:58.340 --> 46:03.140]  And this photo here is a picture of our hemp plants from tissue culture.
[46:03.140 --> 46:04.900]  They were in vitro for two years.
[46:04.900 --> 46:08.960]  We took them out, rooted them, grew them out in the field to see if there were any kind
[46:08.960 --> 46:11.580]  of phenotypic differences, and there were none.
[46:11.580 --> 46:16.340]  So they grew healthy and they grew well, even though when they're propagated from tissue
[46:16.340 --> 46:18.300]  culture.
[46:18.300 --> 46:27.340]  So I think at that point, I'll stop sharing and see if we have some questions.
[46:27.340 --> 46:32.620]  So the question is, can you comment on somatic mutation accumulation in clonal or tissue
[46:32.620 --> 46:38.480]  culture produced plants?
[46:38.480 --> 46:46.740]  So this question from Nicholas, I think what you're asking is, are there phenotypic differences
[46:46.740 --> 46:51.100]  the longer you keep a plant in tissue culture?
[46:51.100 --> 46:59.020]  And yes, theoretically, I mean, obviously, for these studies that we did, they were only
[46:59.020 --> 47:01.980]  short term.
[47:01.980 --> 47:09.380]  But with other plant materials, we know that commercial micropropagators really need to
[47:09.380 --> 47:15.460]  refresh their plant material after a year or two, even, so that they maintain those
[47:15.540 --> 47:20.100]  characteristics, because plants do change over time in tissue culture.
[47:22.100 --> 47:25.300]  And as you mentioned, it's a good way to avoid mutations.
[47:28.290 --> 47:35.250]  Can you comment on somatic mutation accumulation in tissue culture plants?
[47:36.090 --> 47:41.450]  Like I said, if you want to avoid mutations, you need to make sure that your mother plants,
[47:41.810 --> 47:44.370]  your stock plants are refreshed frequently.
[47:44.370 --> 47:49.410]  Like, you know, there's no set rule, but a year, two years, you know, you don't want to
[47:49.410 --> 47:55.090]  keep your cultures five years, 10 years, because what happens is they don't necessarily all
[47:55.090 --> 48:01.970]  mutate. But what will happen is you might get one mutation occurring, and then you
[48:01.970 --> 48:03.290]  propagate it, you know.
[48:03.330 --> 48:07.810]  So then as you go through and you go through stage two and multiply your plants, if you
[48:07.810 --> 48:11.410]  have a mutation, you could very well propagate that mutation.
[48:12.410 --> 48:15.450]  Rooting hormone for certified organic.
[48:15.450 --> 48:17.530]  I assume that's for a stem cutting.
[48:19.730 --> 48:21.930]  I can't answer that question.
[48:22.090 --> 48:23.330]  I'm sorry about that.
[48:23.610 --> 48:24.850]  For rooting hormone.
[48:25.730 --> 48:33.650]  I mean, IAA, endocytic acid, is a natural hormone.
[48:34.370 --> 48:40.530]  And that might qualify as certified organic since it's natural.
[48:40.970 --> 48:45.410]  But I'm not up on the rules for certified organic.
[48:45.450 --> 48:51.570]  But I think you can find natural auxins if that is sufficient to make you certified.
[48:54.410 --> 48:56.730]  Do root riot cubes work?
[48:57.130 --> 49:00.090]  I don't know about root riot cubes.
[49:00.370 --> 49:03.290]  I haven't seen any comparison with hemp on that.
[49:04.890 --> 49:08.210]  Which growing medium is recommended to grow greenhouse?
[49:08.370 --> 49:10.690]  Again, it's up to you.
[49:10.690 --> 49:12.290]  There are a lot of good media out there.
[49:13.890 --> 49:20.330]  You know, basically a 50-50 peat moss perlite or 50-50 peat moss and vermiculite works
[49:20.330 --> 49:27.330]  fine. But any of the bagged commercial mediums now, Pro-Mix, Jiffy Mix, I mean, all
[49:27.330 --> 49:28.730]  those, they make great media.
[49:29.170 --> 49:33.250]  And I would recommend you try a few on your plants and see what works best for you.
[49:33.490 --> 49:35.610]  And then also, you know, economics is involved, too.
[49:35.610 --> 49:36.810]  Some people look at the price.
[49:39.210 --> 49:42.090]  Were questions about certified organic?
[49:43.370 --> 49:50.290]  Is there any research using electromagnetism to grow?
[49:50.290 --> 49:51.930]  Not that I'm aware of.
[49:51.930 --> 49:53.130]  Not that I'm aware of.
[49:53.130 --> 49:59.090]  Do you have recommendations for the control of endophytes in tissue culture?
[49:59.090 --> 50:01.250]  Oh, yes.
[50:01.250 --> 50:05.370]  Sometimes they see the emergence of systemic bacteria.
[50:05.370 --> 50:10.690]  Yes, we had that problem at the very beginning when we started this whole research.
[50:11.010 --> 50:16.770]  We were taking cuttings from greenhouse plants that existed already in the greenhouses.
[50:17.010 --> 50:20.370]  And we had a lot of systemic pathogens.
[50:21.210 --> 50:25.530]  Actually, one of the co-authors, one of my grad students, Victor Zayas, who was on this
[50:25.530 --> 50:32.810]  work, is just meticulous about making sure there are cleaned plant material.
[50:32.810 --> 50:37.650]  And he was noticing a lot of systemic pathogens, bacteria.
[50:37.730 --> 50:44.650]  And so that's one of the reasons why we decided to go to plants that were grown in a
[50:44.650 --> 50:51.570]  growth chamber, because they were, you know, planted in fresh, clean medium and clean
[50:51.570 --> 50:53.450]  pots. And we didn't have that.
[50:54.650 --> 50:55.650]  It is a problem.
[50:56.050 --> 50:57.970]  I would suggest you try other plants.
[50:58.170 --> 51:04.970]  If you can't try other plants, you can actually, considering the tolerance of hemp to
[51:05.210 --> 51:10.130]  the bleach concentration, you can actually try to keep your cuttings in the bleach
[51:10.130 --> 51:14.850]  longer and allow the bleach to soak through the stems longer.
[51:14.850 --> 51:19.410]  And you might be able to remove those systemic pathogens.
[51:19.650 --> 51:23.690]  We have actually done that not with hemp, but with other plants that we had.
[51:23.930 --> 51:30.010]  And each time we subcultured, actually, we would dip them into a bleach solution and
[51:30.010 --> 51:34.370]  then subculture. And over time, after about three or four subcultures, we eliminated the
[51:34.370 --> 51:38.610]  pathogens. Were these trials run on meristem tissue?
[51:39.050 --> 51:43.410]  No, these would run on stem segments, little stem segments.
[51:43.930 --> 51:47.770]  And again, the question is, is there carryover bacteria from the mother plant?
[51:47.770 --> 51:53.410]  There can be. That's why it's important to start with clean plant material.
[51:54.690 --> 52:00.410]  Can you say conclusively that tissue culture plants are immune from viroid?
[52:00.450 --> 52:02.890]  Oh, I conclusively say no, they're not immune.
[52:03.490 --> 52:08.690]  Just because a plant is tissue culture doesn't mean it's any less susceptible.
[52:08.890 --> 52:13.170]  So once you take that plant out of tissue culture, if it's virus free, you take it out
[52:13.170 --> 52:16.690]  of tissue culture and you plant it out in the field or plant it in your greenhouse and
[52:16.690 --> 52:22.050]  then it gets bit by a leafhopper or some other insect carrying the virus, it will get the
[52:22.050 --> 52:28.050]  virus. So that's a good question, because just because a plant is tissue culture doesn't
[52:28.050 --> 52:31.810]  mean that it's resistant to viruses or virides in this case.
[52:33.210 --> 52:36.090]  It just means that they're clean at the time of propagation.
[52:37.290 --> 52:41.050]  The next question is, what is bottleneck of micro propagation?
[52:41.810 --> 52:42.850]  What's the bottleneck?
[52:44.690 --> 52:51.490]  I guess the bottleneck is if you have a large number of plants that you need to produce
[52:51.490 --> 52:57.770]  or you want to produce and you're limited with space under your lights, the grow lights
[52:57.770 --> 53:00.970]  where you're growing your tissue cultures, that's going to be the bottleneck.
[53:01.650 --> 53:06.250]  And scheduling is one of the more difficult things that commercial labs have to do, because
[53:06.490 --> 53:11.650]  if they have to produce 100,000 plants for a certain customer, but they only have room
[53:11.650 --> 53:17.090]  for 10,000, this is just an example, they have to make sure that they can rotate properly
[53:17.090 --> 53:24.330]  in their growth room so that they can produce the amount of plants that they need in the
[53:24.330 --> 53:28.890]  time they need. So I think if there's a bottleneck, that might be it.
[53:31.050 --> 53:36.730]  Seed feminization, I'm not the person to ask about that.
[53:37.930 --> 53:40.770]  I think maybe one of the other speakers down the future might be.
[53:41.770 --> 53:49.650]  Is there any risk in growers' conduction micro propagation without the resources to a genetic testing?
[53:51.770 --> 53:59.490]  So basically, I think what this question is saying is, do we worry about mutation?
[53:59.490 --> 54:02.570]  Somoclonal variation is mutation that occurs in tissue culture.
[54:02.570 --> 54:07.010]  And I think what this question is asking is, should we be worried about it?
[54:07.010 --> 54:08.610]  And is there a way to test for it?
[54:09.090 --> 54:13.050]  And I guess we always should be worried about it.
[54:13.050 --> 54:19.570]  But if you do the protocol correctly, remember, you're taking clones, you're taking organized
[54:19.570 --> 54:24.170]  growing points, and you're allowing them to grow in vitro.
[54:26.290 --> 54:31.090]  If you start with an organized growing point and you subculture correctly, making sure there's no
[54:31.090 --> 54:34.610]  callous production, or if there is callous production that you eliminate it quickly,
[54:35.730 --> 54:38.250]  you should not have genetic mutations.
[54:38.490 --> 54:40.450]  You should not have somoclonal variations.
[54:42.010 --> 54:49.530]  And so I think rather than worrying about genetic testing, I think maybe what you should focus on is your protocol,
[54:49.850 --> 54:55.370]  your procedure to do it correctly in the first place, and you won't have that genetic variation.
[54:56.050 --> 54:58.770]  Can you grow CBD along with CBG?
[55:01.650 --> 55:03.610]  I haven't tried it.
[55:04.090 --> 55:07.490]  I mean, I don't know what that's asking.
[55:07.490 --> 55:14.530]  Actually, asking, does that mean, will the procedures that we're using for CBD have, I assume so.
[55:14.930 --> 55:15.290]  I don't know.
[55:17.210 --> 55:22.490]  Can you cite papers regarding levels for various stage of growth, sufficiently levels?
[55:27.410 --> 55:30.130]  I'm not sure what a sufficiency level is.
[55:31.130 --> 55:33.130]  So no, I can't.
[55:35.130 --> 55:37.130]  Interesting question.
[55:37.130 --> 55:40.130]  What is the time frame from stage one to stage four?
[55:40.130 --> 55:42.130]  We get that question a lot.
[55:43.130 --> 55:49.130]  And that's a hard question to ask because it depends on how many plants you're producing at stage two.
[55:51.130 --> 55:57.130]  If you're talking about just going through from stage one to stage four directly for one plant,
[55:58.130 --> 56:08.130]  you're going to put your plant in stage one for four weeks, subculture it onto stage two for maybe eight weeks for it to grow, and then onto stage four.
[56:08.130 --> 56:15.130]  So theoretically, you can do it as fast as three months, although usually that's not the case.
[56:16.130 --> 56:24.130]  Paul asks us, how long can clones taken from other plants be grown under lights before being acclimated without shocking them?
[56:25.130 --> 56:38.130]  Okay, just like any other plant, hemp or tomato or whatever plant you're growing, if they're growing indoors under artificial lights, you can move them outside.
[56:39.130 --> 56:43.130]  But you do need to harden them off by gradually increasing the light intensity.
[56:43.130 --> 56:48.130]  So how long does it take?
[56:48.130 --> 56:52.130]  I'd say a week to 10 days, you can harden them off pretty quickly.
[56:53.130 --> 56:57.130]  Karen asks, have you seen a variation in cannabinoid concentration?
[56:57.130 --> 57:03.130]  We don't do any work with testing cannabinoid concentration, so I can't answer that.
[57:04.130 --> 57:08.130]  Male plants have male flowers and female plants have female flowers.
[57:08.130 --> 57:10.130]  That's what diatases.
[57:11.130 --> 57:21.130]  Jack is asking, is any work being done at our research center in regards to hemp breeding, focusing on secondary cannabinoids?
[57:21.130 --> 57:23.130]  No, we are not doing any of that.
[57:23.130 --> 57:27.130]  All the breeding work is up in Geneva with Larry Smart's team.
[57:27.130 --> 57:33.130]  So you may want to check with Larry Smart and his team up there, George Stack and that whole group.
[57:34.130 --> 57:42.130]  John asks, is there a good way to determine when to remove the humidity dome in the propagation process?
[57:42.130 --> 57:52.130]  We have found that our micropropagated plants, as well as regular stem cuttings, root pretty quickly, 10 days to 14 days.
[57:53.130 --> 58:03.130]  So I would look after a week, I would open up the dome, just pull out a few cuttings and see if there's roots on them.
[58:03.130 --> 58:12.130]  And then when you open them up, that's going to allow some of the humidity out, which is fine and help decrease the chance of any kind of molds.
[58:12.130 --> 58:20.130]  So I think the best way is that once you have root initiation, then you don't have to worry about the dome so much.
[58:21.130 --> 58:30.130]  Remember, research a long time ago found out that it only takes 24 hours for a plant to regrow its waxy cuticle from tissue culture.
[58:30.130 --> 58:32.130]  It's a very fast process.
[58:32.130 --> 58:35.130]  Ellen Sutter did that work way back in the 80s.
[58:35.130 --> 58:42.130]  So once you take a tissue culture plants out, it's only about 24 hours until the waxy cuticles there.
[58:43.130 --> 58:49.130]  Colleen asks about willow water. I don't know anything about willow water. Sorry.
[58:51.130 --> 58:55.130]  Can tissue culture media be used for storing seeds? Yes, definitely.
[58:55.130 --> 59:02.130]  But most of the media that I mentioned today, especially the Mirashigi media are very high salts.
[59:03.130 --> 59:13.130]  And so what you want to do is to maybe, well not maybe, but do reduce the salt levels if you're using tissue culture media by down to 25%.
[59:13.130 --> 59:21.130]  We will germinate seeds in Mirashigi and scoob medium at 25% levels.
[59:21.130 --> 59:24.130]  So yes, you can germinate seeds and they're pretty easy actually.
[59:25.130 --> 59:30.130]  Amy asks, are there recommendations other than bleach for stage one?
[59:30.130 --> 59:34.130]  Yeah, you can use hydrogen peroxide.
[59:34.130 --> 59:37.130]  You can use ethanol, low levels of ethanol.
[59:37.130 --> 59:40.130]  They work as well as bleach ethanol.
[59:40.130 --> 59:43.130]  You have to be a little more careful because it fixes cells, right?
[59:43.130 --> 59:44.130]  It kills cells.
[59:44.130 --> 59:46.130]  But it can be done.
[59:46.130 --> 59:54.130]  Tom asks what agencies or services are available to individuals in New York for establishing a micropropagation facility?
[59:54.130 --> 59:56.130]  There's no agencies, but I'm here to help.
[59:56.130 --> 59:58.130]  That's part of my job is in extension.
[59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.130]  So drop me an email, Tom.
[01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.130]  I'll be glad to work with you.
[01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:07.130]  What types of indoor outdoor research is most needed?
[01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.130]  Trevor, you tell us.
[01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:10.130]  We're here to do the work.
[01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.130]  You tell us what you want us to do.
[01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.130]  Colleen asks about crossbreeding.
[01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:15.130]  I don't do any breeding.
[01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:16.130]  I just do the tissue culture.
[01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:19.130]  So Larry Smart's the guy to talk to.
[01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.130]  What type of lighting?
[01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.130]  We use regular fluorescent lights.
[01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:27.130]  We don't use LED lights.
[01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:33.130]  Colleen asks, are there commercial forums we can see tissue culture work?
[01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:38.130]  Yes, up in Ithaca, there's a lot of commercial forums.
[01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:44.130]  Yes, up in Ithaca, there's what's the name of that business?
[01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:54.130]  There's a tissue culture lab in Ithaca that I can't remember what the name is, but there is a tissue culture lab up there.
[01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:58.130]  Ryan, I can't remember his last name.
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.130]  But there is a lab in Ithaca.
[01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:04.130]  There aren't too many commercial labs in New York.
[01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:11.130]  I think there's a lot of interest in hydroponics.
[01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:15.130]  Dr. Neal Madsen up in Ithaca has a great program in hydroponics.
[01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:21.130]  I'm not sure if he's doing any hemp or not, but he's the great resource.
[01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:24.130]  He's the best in the country.
[01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:32.660]  Jeff asks, do you have lighting intensity recommendations?
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:41.660]  I don't have those figures on the tip of my tongue, but I can help you with that, Jeff, if you drop me an email.
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.660]  There's a lot of questions here.
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:49.660]  Cindy Sittley asks, can a plant flowered under the in vitro conditions?
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.660]  Yes, it can flower in the tube and it's really cool when you see it.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:59.660]  We had that happen during our research, and it's interesting.
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.660]  We were kind of confused because they were growing under long days.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.660]  Are viruses transmittable through seeds?
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.660]  Yes, definitely.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.660]  It depends on the virus.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:14.660]  Not all viruses are transmitted through seeds, but there are some.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:21.660]  Chad asks, has any research done with biostimulants or mycorrhizae fungi?
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.660]  Not to my knowledge.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.660]  There may be, but I don't know that.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:32.660]  Rena, nice to see you.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:36.660]  Rena asks, are the protocols universal for cannabis?
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.660]  Are they cultivar specific?
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.660]  Well, good question, Rena.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:46.660]  I would say that we did this research with one cultivar to reduce that
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.660]  variable of genetics.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:51.660]  So we did TJ's CBT on all this research.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.660]  But, and I would expect,
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.660]  I suspect that there are going to be differences for different cultivars
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.660]  and different genetics.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.660]  But this gives you a foundation of where to begin.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.660]  Where you can start your program.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.660]  And just like everything else, not only in tissue culture,
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.660]  you know, other plants, we know that.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:16.660]  Genetics makes a difference.
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.660]  So there might be some tweaking you need with this protocol.
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.660]  And Marcus asks,
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.660]  have you noticed any benefits in seed production from micro propagation?
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.660]  We haven't really gone that far. No, sorry.
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.660]  I think we're going to have to wait until the end of May.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.660]  So we're going to have to wait until the end of May.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.660]  And then we'll have a minimum time to transplant outdoors down here.
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.660]  On Long Island.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.660]  Our last frost free date is about March.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.660]  May 15th. It's early.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.660]  So we, we could plant.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.660]  By the end of May.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.660]  I think up in Ithaca, I don't know where you're located, but.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:53.660]  Colder climates. You might have to wait.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.660]  I think that's it.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.660]  The session was supposed to end at 3.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.660]  But I think they had.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.660]  They were very interesting questions that I actually wanted to.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.660]  Wanted to see answers.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.660]  So I'm very happy that there's a lot of participation by all day.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.660]  At 10 days.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.660]  So with that, I concludes our webinar for today.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.660]  And please.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.660]  Join us.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.660]  In two weeks, actually February 22nd to talk about.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.660]  The.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.660]  The.
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.660]  The future conditions or in the cultivation.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.660]  By Dr.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.660]  So thank you so much.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:34.510]  And thank you all of you for joining this webinar today.
[01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:39.510]  Thank you, everybody. Have a nice day.
[01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:42.510]  This has been a production of Cornell university.
[01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:44.510]  On the web at Cornell.edu.
