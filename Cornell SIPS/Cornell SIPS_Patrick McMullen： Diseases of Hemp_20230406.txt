[00:00.000 --> 00:07.930]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.930 --> 00:08.930]  Hi, everyone.
[00:08.930 --> 00:12.090]  Welcome again to the 2023 Hemp Webinar Series.
[00:12.090 --> 00:15.410]  My name is Luis Monserrate, a second year PhD student
[00:15.410 --> 00:18.130]  in plant breeding and genetics in Larry Smarts Lab
[00:18.130 --> 00:19.650]  at Cornell University.
[00:19.650 --> 00:23.370]  I am accompanied by Cornell alum, Tony Baracco,
[00:23.370 --> 00:27.330]  who has assisted me in bringing this webinar together,
[00:27.330 --> 00:33.130]  also by Kim and Gemma, who have provided this digital platform
[00:33.130 --> 00:35.650]  for us to have our webinar series.
[00:35.650 --> 00:39.010]  And today, we have a special guest, my advisor, Dr. Larry
[00:39.010 --> 00:40.970]  Smart, professor of plant breeding and genetics
[00:40.970 --> 00:42.770]  at Cornell University.
[00:42.770 --> 00:44.530]  And lastly, I just want to mention
[00:44.530 --> 00:47.650]  that this webinar is a component of a larger project, which
[00:47.650 --> 00:50.450]  is the development of educational modules that
[00:50.450 --> 00:53.050]  will be freely available on the Cornell Hemp website
[00:53.050 --> 00:55.090]  at the end of this webinar series.
[00:55.090 --> 00:58.290]  Each module will consist of the recorded webinar,
[00:58.290 --> 00:59.890]  and the instructional slide deck,
[00:59.890 --> 01:02.810]  and a couple of high-impact papers
[01:02.810 --> 01:04.730]  pertaining to the respective subject.
[01:04.730 --> 01:08.970]  For instance, in this case, it will be hemp diseases.
[01:08.970 --> 01:11.570]  All webinar recordings will be available on the Cornell SIPS
[01:11.570 --> 01:13.770]  YouTube channel if you're interested in re-watching them
[01:13.770 --> 01:15.930]  or sharing them with someone that could not attend.
[01:15.930 --> 01:19.890]  So with that, it is my pleasure to introduce Patrick McMillan.
[01:19.890 --> 01:24.010]  He is a PhD candidate at Cornell University in plant pathology
[01:24.010 --> 01:26.210]  in Chris Smarts Lab.
[01:26.250 --> 01:30.210]  Unfortunately, Chris could not join us today
[01:30.210 --> 01:31.730]  due to scheduling conflicts, which
[01:31.730 --> 01:34.410]  is why Patrick is presenting on her behalf.
[01:34.410 --> 01:36.850]  And his talk today is going to be on hemp diseases.
[01:36.850 --> 01:41.050]  So Patrick, without any further ado, take it away.
[01:41.050 --> 01:42.330]  Thank you, Luis.
[01:42.330 --> 01:45.530]  And it's great to have everyone here today for this talk.
[01:45.530 --> 01:49.090]  So like Luis said, I'm a third-year PhD candidate
[01:49.090 --> 01:53.090]  here at Cornell University in Chris Smarts Lab,
[01:53.090 --> 01:56.490]  where I study primarily pythium damping off
[01:56.490 --> 01:59.330]  on hemp and pythium root rots.
[01:59.330 --> 02:02.090]  Today, I'll be covering a bunch of different diseases
[02:02.090 --> 02:06.010]  that we see on hemp and showing characteristics of them
[02:06.010 --> 02:09.130]  and some of what you can do to manage these diseases
[02:09.130 --> 02:11.650]  if you observe them in your growing system.
[02:11.650 --> 02:14.130]  A lot of this work has been done by other collaborators
[02:14.130 --> 02:17.850]  in my lab, previous grad student Allie Kalla, current student
[02:17.850 --> 02:22.370]  Jocelyn Schwartz, techs Colin Day, Taylor Herman,
[02:22.370 --> 02:26.570]  and Chris Smart, my advisor.
[02:26.570 --> 02:30.650]  So I know for the posting for this talk,
[02:30.650 --> 02:32.410]  we made the disclaimer that we aren't
[02:32.410 --> 02:36.730]  going to be focusing on hoplite and viroid, which
[02:36.730 --> 02:39.330]  is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue
[02:39.330 --> 02:40.330]  across the country.
[02:40.330 --> 02:42.930]  However, we haven't yet seen this in New York state.
[02:42.930 --> 02:45.650]  So we're not researching this here,
[02:45.650 --> 02:48.570]  but I did just want to mention a couple of things
[02:48.610 --> 02:53.170]  about hoplite and viroid here right at the beginning.
[02:53.170 --> 02:56.330]  So on the left here is just a healthy plant
[02:56.330 --> 02:59.250]  that was not infected with hoplite and viroid.
[02:59.250 --> 03:01.370]  It was mock inoculated.
[03:01.370 --> 03:03.730]  Here on the right is one that is infected
[03:03.730 --> 03:05.770]  with hoplite and viroid.
[03:05.770 --> 03:08.530]  And you can see that this infected plant shows
[03:08.530 --> 03:12.930]  smaller fan leaves and leaf epinasticity
[03:12.930 --> 03:16.090]  in the plants infected with this viroid.
[03:16.130 --> 03:19.610]  So while this is seen in some parts of the country,
[03:19.610 --> 03:24.250]  but not here, there is work going on in some other labs.
[03:24.250 --> 03:26.170]  And there's some great publications
[03:26.170 --> 03:30.090]  in the Viruses journal.
[03:30.090 --> 03:32.650]  So first, I'd just like to give a general overview of what
[03:32.650 --> 03:36.010]  I'll be covering through the remainder of this talk.
[03:36.010 --> 03:39.530]  So I'll begin with a very brief pathogen concepts
[03:39.530 --> 03:43.050]  overview to just preview the types of things
[03:43.050 --> 03:44.690]  I'll be talking about.
[03:44.690 --> 03:47.810]  And then I'll move into examples of bacterial diseases,
[03:47.810 --> 03:50.970]  followed by fungal diseases, which are most common diseases
[03:50.970 --> 03:56.250]  on hemp, water molds or oomycete pathogens.
[03:56.250 --> 03:58.730]  And then I'd like to share some research results
[03:58.730 --> 04:02.570]  from experiments that were conducted here at Cornell,
[04:02.570 --> 04:08.860]  including my own research on lithium damping off.
[04:08.860 --> 04:12.100]  So what do you need to know to reduce hemp diseases
[04:12.100 --> 04:13.460]  in your growing system?
[04:13.460 --> 04:16.660]  Well, first, it's important to think about what types of things
[04:16.660 --> 04:19.540]  that a pathogen needs in order to infect a plant.
[04:19.540 --> 04:22.500]  So plant pathologists often like to think of this concept
[04:22.500 --> 04:26.500]  in something that we refer to as the disease triangle.
[04:29.260 --> 04:30.340]  There we go.
[04:30.340 --> 04:33.460]  So in order for disease to occur,
[04:33.460 --> 04:35.860]  there's three components that are essential.
[04:35.860 --> 04:38.540]  You need a susceptible host cultivar.
[04:38.540 --> 04:41.260]  So a cultivar of hemp that's susceptible
[04:41.260 --> 04:44.300]  to whatever particular pathogen.
[04:44.300 --> 04:45.940]  You need that pathogen to be present
[04:45.940 --> 04:47.900]  and you need a virulent strain of it.
[04:47.900 --> 04:51.460]  There's a virulent strains of pathogens around
[04:51.460 --> 04:52.700]  that might not infect,
[04:52.700 --> 04:54.900]  even if it is a susceptible host cultivar.
[04:56.060 --> 05:00.100]  And then finally, you need a favorable environment.
[05:00.100 --> 05:04.260]  So pathogens often require certain conditions,
[05:04.260 --> 05:07.900]  whether that's moisture content or temperature
[05:07.900 --> 05:11.780]  in order for them to successfully infect a plant.
[05:11.780 --> 05:15.820]  So without all three of those components coming together,
[05:16.700 --> 05:17.700]  you won't see disease occurring.
[05:23.380 --> 05:24.700]  So then moving on,
[05:25.860 --> 05:27.460]  things that you should be considering
[05:27.460 --> 05:29.740]  when you want to develop management plans
[05:29.740 --> 05:32.140]  for your particular growing system.
[05:32.140 --> 05:33.980]  It's important to know what pathogens are common
[05:33.980 --> 05:36.300]  on your farm or in your area.
[05:36.300 --> 05:39.500]  What have other neighboring growers seen in recent years
[05:39.500 --> 05:41.500]  or what have you seen year to year?
[05:41.500 --> 05:44.900]  Keeping some sort of record of that can be very helpful.
[05:45.860 --> 05:49.540]  Knowing the rotation history of the field you're planting in
[05:50.380 --> 05:51.460]  can be important.
[05:51.460 --> 05:54.940]  Some pathogens can survive on multiple hosts,
[05:54.940 --> 05:57.220]  whereas others have a very limited host range.
[05:57.220 --> 05:59.060]  So knowing what pathogens have been there
[05:59.060 --> 06:02.060]  and how they overwinter is important to management as well.
[06:03.860 --> 06:05.620]  Like I mentioned just before,
[06:05.620 --> 06:08.140]  environmental conditions are very important
[06:08.140 --> 06:10.060]  for diseases to occur.
[06:11.180 --> 06:14.100]  So knowing what pathogens are in your area
[06:14.100 --> 06:17.300]  and as well as what types of environment you normally see
[06:18.140 --> 06:19.780]  all contribute to this.
[06:19.780 --> 06:21.540]  And that becomes a little bit more difficult
[06:21.540 --> 06:24.300]  as we see a greater variability
[06:24.300 --> 06:26.300]  in climate season to season right now.
[06:28.300 --> 06:30.820]  So then when we're considering managing the pathogens
[06:30.820 --> 06:32.100]  that we do have,
[06:32.100 --> 06:34.900]  cultural practices are often our best bet
[06:34.900 --> 06:37.180]  at reducing pathogen pressure.
[06:37.180 --> 06:39.700]  So things like avoidance,
[06:39.700 --> 06:42.100]  not avoiding the pathogen itself,
[06:42.100 --> 06:44.380]  not planting in very wet areas,
[06:45.220 --> 06:47.420]  pruning, those sorts of things
[06:47.420 --> 06:50.220]  that we'll discuss more detail in the coming slides.
[06:51.500 --> 06:55.820]  And then finally, chemical control is our last fallback.
[06:55.820 --> 06:58.780]  So what products can we use to control diseases
[06:58.780 --> 07:02.260]  that you expect to see in your field?
[07:02.260 --> 07:04.900]  And is there any efficacy data supporting
[07:06.140 --> 07:08.780]  the efficacy of products registered for hemp disease
[07:08.780 --> 07:10.100]  as common in your area?
[07:10.100 --> 07:11.620]  Now, it's important to know
[07:11.620 --> 07:16.620]  that there aren't as many registered pesticides
[07:16.620 --> 07:19.260]  available for hemp as in other crops.
[07:19.260 --> 07:20.700]  However, this number is growing.
[07:20.700 --> 07:21.780]  And it's always just important
[07:21.780 --> 07:24.380]  to make sure you read the pesticide product label
[07:24.380 --> 07:27.100]  and follow all instructions for your location.
[07:30.060 --> 07:32.540]  So the first group of pathogens I would like to talk about
[07:32.540 --> 07:34.980]  are diseases caused by bacterial pathogens.
[07:37.300 --> 07:40.580]  One that we've seen here in New York recently
[07:40.580 --> 07:42.140]  is serratio marcescens,
[07:42.140 --> 07:45.020]  which causes this necrosis on the leaf tissue
[07:45.020 --> 07:47.780]  and wilt and senescence of the leaf.
[07:47.780 --> 07:48.620]  When we plate this out,
[07:48.620 --> 07:50.980]  we often see these white to pinkish colonies
[07:50.980 --> 07:52.300]  growing in culture.
[07:54.740 --> 07:58.540]  Serratio marcescens is usually seen early in the season,
[07:58.540 --> 08:02.020]  and it thrives mostly in cool, wet years.
[08:02.980 --> 08:07.140]  So as the summer progresses and it warms up a little bit,
[08:07.140 --> 08:09.260]  we usually see less of this disease.
[08:10.220 --> 08:13.860]  As the disease progresses
[08:13.860 --> 08:16.500]  and this necrotic area moves across the leaf,
[08:16.500 --> 08:18.500]  spreads across the leaf tissue,
[08:18.500 --> 08:22.140]  the leaf will eventually senesce and fall off.
[08:22.140 --> 08:24.140]  After losing some of these infected leaves,
[08:24.140 --> 08:27.660]  the plant is often able to grow out of this disease
[08:27.660 --> 08:30.700]  and shouldn't really become too much of an issue
[08:30.700 --> 08:32.980]  unless the environment is very favorable
[08:32.980 --> 08:36.020]  for this disease in a particular year.
[08:36.540 --> 08:40.860]  There's also a number of bacterial leaf spots
[08:40.860 --> 08:42.420]  that have been observed.
[08:42.420 --> 08:44.420]  There's several different species of bacteria
[08:44.420 --> 08:46.620]  that can cause leaf spots,
[08:46.620 --> 08:48.780]  such as these where you see black lesions
[08:48.780 --> 08:49.900]  on the leaf surface.
[08:51.140 --> 08:54.980]  Some of the bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas canabina,
[08:54.980 --> 08:58.020]  can cause disease on other crop plants as well.
[08:58.020 --> 09:01.660]  While we have observed some of these leaf spots,
[09:01.660 --> 09:04.340]  they're not terribly common in this area of New York.
[09:07.450 --> 09:11.010]  So bacterial pathogens have yet to be well characterized
[09:11.010 --> 09:14.770]  in hemp and understand their biology and epidemiology
[09:14.770 --> 09:17.010]  in order to inform management strategies.
[09:17.010 --> 09:19.530]  They haven't become kind of the overarching
[09:19.530 --> 09:23.330]  prevalent disease group that infects hemp.
[09:23.330 --> 09:25.970]  Fungal pathogens, however, are much more common
[09:25.970 --> 09:27.450]  and there's a wide array of them
[09:27.450 --> 09:29.570]  that are very problematic to growers.
[09:30.730 --> 09:35.730]  One of the most common fungal leaf spots in hemp
[09:36.050 --> 09:38.250]  is Septoria leaf spot.
[09:38.250 --> 09:40.810]  It's caused by the fungus Septoria cannabis.
[09:41.810 --> 09:43.930]  They form these lesions on the leaves
[09:43.930 --> 09:45.890]  that have a brown necrotic center
[09:45.890 --> 09:47.610]  followed by yellow halo.
[09:48.970 --> 09:51.810]  Eventually these lesions will coalesce
[09:51.810 --> 09:54.890]  and lead to defoliation of the leaves.
[09:54.890 --> 09:57.970]  The spores are spread via wind and splashing of rain
[09:58.890 --> 10:01.970]  and this pathogen can overwinter in the soil.
[10:01.970 --> 10:06.730]  So this is where knowing your previous crop rotation
[10:06.730 --> 10:08.130]  in your fields is important.
[10:09.090 --> 10:12.050]  Removing leaves or branches near the base of the plant
[10:12.050 --> 10:15.090]  and thinning the plant to increase airflow
[10:15.090 --> 10:16.810]  will help reduce the disease.
[10:20.340 --> 10:22.740]  And here's just an image of someone pruning off
[10:22.740 --> 10:25.740]  some dense foliage in order to increase airflow in the plant.
[10:28.460 --> 10:33.220]  So here's a more up close image of Septoria leaf spot.
[10:33.260 --> 10:35.780]  You're seeing this lesion with the characteristic dark brown
[10:35.780 --> 10:38.460]  or black dots in the center of it.
[10:38.460 --> 10:41.300]  Here in those darkened areas
[10:41.300 --> 10:43.260]  are where the fungal spores are contained
[10:43.260 --> 10:45.100]  and these are released from the structures
[10:45.100 --> 10:47.380]  during periods of leaf wetness.
[10:47.380 --> 10:48.940]  So the wetness is really important
[10:48.940 --> 10:51.420]  in order for this pathogen to spread
[10:51.420 --> 10:54.380]  onto neighboring leaves and neighboring plants.
[10:54.380 --> 10:56.700]  Currently a student in our lab
[10:56.700 --> 11:01.620]  is working on screening some sessions of hemp,
[11:01.620 --> 11:03.220]  about 75 different cultivars
[11:03.220 --> 11:05.180]  for resistance to Septoria leaf spot
[11:06.060 --> 11:08.260]  to look for any kind of genetic resistance
[11:08.260 --> 11:09.460]  that can inform breeders
[11:11.020 --> 11:13.340]  to incorporate into their cultivars.
[11:13.340 --> 11:16.140]  And we're also testing biofungicides for efficacy
[11:16.140 --> 11:18.580]  to control this pathogen as well.
[11:18.580 --> 11:21.060]  So hopefully we'll have more exciting news
[11:21.060 --> 11:23.020]  in the coming years on how to control
[11:23.020 --> 11:24.900]  this very common leaf spot.
[11:27.820 --> 11:30.500]  Another common leaf spot that is observed
[11:30.500 --> 11:32.540]  is Bipolaris leaf spot
[11:33.060 --> 11:35.820]  caused by the fungus, Breschelera gigantia.
[11:35.820 --> 11:37.700]  Now that might seem a little bit confusing
[11:37.700 --> 11:39.220]  with the nomenclature here,
[11:39.220 --> 11:41.220]  but fungal taxonomy is always changing.
[11:41.220 --> 11:45.380]  So the names don't necessarily line up,
[11:45.380 --> 11:47.460]  but this is often commonly referred to
[11:47.460 --> 11:49.460]  as Bipolaris leaf spot.
[11:49.460 --> 11:51.380]  The lesions here on the leaves
[11:51.380 --> 11:53.380]  that you see from Bipolaris
[11:53.380 --> 11:57.940]  are much smaller than those of Serratia,
[11:57.940 --> 11:59.100]  or Septoria, sorry.
[11:59.540 --> 12:01.940]  And they usually have this yellow color
[12:03.380 --> 12:06.620]  compared to other leaf spots, which are darker.
[12:06.620 --> 12:08.180]  These can infect other plants,
[12:08.180 --> 12:09.980]  including weed species as well.
[12:10.860 --> 12:13.780]  So in scenarios like this,
[12:13.780 --> 12:15.300]  weed control is very important
[12:16.260 --> 12:19.260]  because you don't want a dense coverage of weeds
[12:19.260 --> 12:21.700]  that can harbor pathogens and infect your crop.
[12:22.620 --> 12:24.580]  Like many other fungal pathogens,
[12:24.580 --> 12:26.820]  Bipolaris is favored by wet weather.
[12:32.040 --> 12:35.680]  And then another leaf spot, Pristulia area,
[12:35.680 --> 12:40.360]  is very common under certain climate conditions.
[12:40.360 --> 12:43.680]  We saw a lot of this in 2021 here in New York.
[12:43.680 --> 12:47.000]  It forms these very distinct target-shaped lesions
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.880]  with concentric circles.
[12:48.880 --> 12:50.720]  So it's pretty easy to distinguish
[12:50.720 --> 12:52.960]  from the others that we talked about.
[12:52.960 --> 12:54.480]  Like the other leaf spots,
[12:54.480 --> 12:59.200]  it can cause defoliation when it progresses far enough.
[12:59.760 --> 13:02.640]  This does have other hosts, including maple trees.
[13:02.640 --> 13:04.360]  So you might see this
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.480]  if you're growing close to a wooded area.
[13:08.080 --> 13:09.440]  However, very little is known
[13:09.440 --> 13:11.760]  about the impact of the pathogen on hemp yet,
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.920]  as far as yield reductions or how prevalent it is really.
[13:16.920 --> 13:20.280]  We've just observed this a number of times in the region.
[13:25.460 --> 13:30.460]  So another interesting foliar pathogen of hemp is hemp rust.
[13:31.140 --> 13:33.420]  Now rust are very important
[13:33.420 --> 13:38.420]  and need to be controlled heavily on green crops like wheat.
[13:38.700 --> 13:40.940]  Wheat rust is a very problematic issue.
[13:40.940 --> 13:44.900]  On hemp, it often isn't as severe
[13:44.900 --> 13:48.660]  where it forms these pustules on the underside of leaves
[13:48.660 --> 13:50.180]  and can cause defoliation
[13:52.100 --> 13:56.140]  and yield reductions in very severe outbreaks.
[13:56.140 --> 13:59.020]  But typically you're only seeing small amounts of it.
[13:59.820 --> 14:04.820]  The causal species of hemp rust is Eurydice cregariana.
[14:06.660 --> 14:08.460]  It forms orange colored spores
[14:08.460 --> 14:09.820]  on the underside of the leaves
[14:09.820 --> 14:12.540]  that form these larger pustules.
[14:12.540 --> 14:13.620]  Once it's on the leaf,
[14:13.620 --> 14:16.940]  it can spread throughout this leaf tissue
[14:16.940 --> 14:18.260]  and the spores are windblown
[14:18.260 --> 14:20.180]  to other neighboring leaves and plants.
[14:21.420 --> 14:23.860]  Little is known about the pathogen life cycle
[14:23.860 --> 14:26.500]  of this particular species on hemp right now.
[14:26.500 --> 14:28.100]  Some rusts have alternative hosts
[14:28.100 --> 14:31.140]  that they need a second plant species
[14:31.140 --> 14:33.420]  to complete its life cycle on.
[14:33.420 --> 14:35.780]  This species just has not been studied enough yet
[14:35.780 --> 14:38.420]  for us to know those details.
[14:39.900 --> 14:40.940]  And like I mentioned,
[14:40.940 --> 14:44.100]  it's not among the most common pathogens
[14:44.100 --> 14:45.260]  that we see here in New York,
[14:45.260 --> 14:47.260]  but we have found it a couple of times.
[14:50.740 --> 14:52.820]  A pathogen that is very common
[14:52.820 --> 14:55.580]  and infects the flower buds of the plant,
[14:55.580 --> 14:59.500]  the inflorescence, is gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea.
[15:00.540 --> 15:02.940]  So when Botrytis first infects,
[15:02.940 --> 15:05.380]  you'll see this characteristic gray mold,
[15:05.380 --> 15:06.660]  where it gets its name from,
[15:06.660 --> 15:09.020]  covering the inflorescence of the plant,
[15:09.020 --> 15:12.900]  which will eventually turn into brown necrotic tissue,
[15:12.900 --> 15:16.500]  making this flower bud totally unmarketable.
[15:17.620 --> 15:21.580]  So this can be very problematic for growers,
[15:21.580 --> 15:24.260]  particularly in very humid climates,
[15:24.260 --> 15:25.660]  where this can be seen a lot
[15:25.660 --> 15:28.220]  in controlled environment agriculture
[15:28.220 --> 15:30.060]  and where there's a lot of moisture.
[15:32.100 --> 15:34.460]  We see this more in cultivars
[15:34.460 --> 15:37.100]  with very tight floral development.
[15:37.100 --> 15:40.500]  So anywhere where it can trap in a lot of moisture
[15:40.500 --> 15:43.780]  and prevent increased airflow
[15:43.780 --> 15:46.540]  will be a perfect environment for Botrytis to develop.
[15:47.740 --> 15:50.020]  And you'll see greater fungal sporulation
[15:50.020 --> 15:51.660]  in rain or higher humidity.
[15:53.140 --> 15:55.140]  This pathogen shouldn't be confused
[15:55.140 --> 15:56.420]  with Fusarium head blight,
[15:56.420 --> 16:01.140]  which is a similar inflorescence-infecting pathogen.
[16:02.940 --> 16:06.580]  So Fusarium head blight and bud blight
[16:06.580 --> 16:09.180]  is caused by several species of Fusarium.
[16:10.500 --> 16:12.940]  These fungi can produce dangerous mycotoxins
[16:12.940 --> 16:15.140]  in cereals and other grains.
[16:15.140 --> 16:17.660]  And the species that do infect hemp
[16:17.660 --> 16:20.420]  are known to cause these mycotoxins.
[16:20.420 --> 16:21.780]  However, it hasn't been studied yet
[16:21.780 --> 16:26.380]  whether mycotoxins are produced on hemp inflorescences.
[16:27.260 --> 16:29.980]  There's currently some wonderful research being done
[16:29.980 --> 16:33.220]  on Fusarium head blight by Nicole Gauthier's lab
[16:33.220 --> 16:35.140]  down in the University of Kentucky.
[16:36.060 --> 16:38.260]  So for more information on Fusarium bud blight,
[16:38.260 --> 16:40.660]  I would strongly recommend looking at some of her work
[16:40.660 --> 16:41.620]  and her lab's work.
[16:43.060 --> 16:46.540]  It's very important to be aware of potential mycotoxins
[16:50.260 --> 16:53.780]  forming because these are very dangerous
[16:53.820 --> 16:57.300]  to any livestock that you might be marketing grain for
[16:57.300 --> 17:01.140]  or in other food products.
[17:01.140 --> 17:04.100]  We don't really know how common this is yet in New York.
[17:04.100 --> 17:08.180]  We haven't conducted many population biology studies
[17:08.180 --> 17:10.060]  or studied the epidemiology of this,
[17:10.060 --> 17:12.020]  as you're probably getting the gist of
[17:12.020 --> 17:13.660]  with a lot of these pathogens,
[17:13.660 --> 17:15.860]  we're just beginning to study a lot of them.
[17:21.260 --> 17:25.300]  One more pathogen that infects the inflorescence,
[17:25.300 --> 17:30.300]  and well, essentially the whole above ground portion of hemp
[17:31.740 --> 17:32.900]  is white mold.
[17:32.900 --> 17:35.740]  White mold has a very, very broad host range.
[17:35.740 --> 17:37.740]  So crop rotation probably isn't going to help you
[17:37.740 --> 17:38.700]  in this instance.
[17:41.140 --> 17:43.660]  It can infect many different crops.
[17:43.660 --> 17:46.740]  It's caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
[17:47.620 --> 17:50.640]  White mold infects the stem of the plant
[17:50.640 --> 17:53.700]  where it can clog the veins of the plant
[17:53.700 --> 17:55.060]  that prevent water flow
[17:55.060 --> 17:57.420]  from reaching the upper shoots of the plant.
[17:57.420 --> 18:01.700]  So as it cuts off the water flow from the upper shoots,
[18:01.700 --> 18:04.340]  you'll see the plant start to die from the top down.
[18:05.540 --> 18:08.180]  And you'll also see this characteristic white mycelial growth
[18:08.180 --> 18:09.980]  over the stem of the plant.
[18:09.980 --> 18:11.420]  If you break open the stem,
[18:11.420 --> 18:15.540]  you'll often find these hard black pieces
[18:15.540 --> 18:17.460]  that are part of the fungus itself.
[18:17.460 --> 18:19.220]  They're the sclerotia
[18:19.220 --> 18:23.020]  or the hardy overwintering spores of this fungus.
[18:23.020 --> 18:25.340]  So those will fall down to the soil
[18:25.340 --> 18:28.740]  and allow this pathogen to overwinter
[18:28.740 --> 18:29.980]  and survive year to year.
[18:34.010 --> 18:37.150]  So moving on from foliar and floral pathogens,
[18:38.130 --> 18:43.130]  I'd like to move to some root and crown infecting diseases.
[18:43.570 --> 18:46.010]  So while I mentioned just before that
[18:46.010 --> 18:47.490]  there's some species of Fusarium
[18:47.490 --> 18:49.330]  that infect the bud of the plant,
[18:49.330 --> 18:52.010]  there's also species that infect
[18:52.010 --> 18:53.770]  the crown and roots of hemp.
[18:54.770 --> 18:57.810]  Some of these species include Fusarium oxysprum,
[18:57.810 --> 18:59.330]  selenii and proliferatum.
[19:00.890 --> 19:04.930]  We've seen a lot of this across grower fields in New York
[19:04.930 --> 19:06.730]  and in some of our own field trials.
[19:07.690 --> 19:11.290]  This is often observed by browning and wilting
[19:11.290 --> 19:12.730]  of the shoots of the plant
[19:12.730 --> 19:14.930]  and total plant collapse eventually.
[19:14.930 --> 19:15.930]  If you dig up the plant,
[19:15.930 --> 19:19.130]  you'll see some reddening and browning on the roots
[19:19.130 --> 19:22.030]  and overall reduced root biomass.
[19:23.030 --> 19:26.790]  So similar to what I discussed about white mold
[19:26.790 --> 19:29.390]  blocking off the water flow of the plant,
[19:29.390 --> 19:31.430]  Fusarium will do this also,
[19:31.430 --> 19:34.590]  but starting at a much lower point in the plant.
[19:34.590 --> 19:37.830]  So it will infect the veins or the roots
[19:37.830 --> 19:40.150]  and block off the water flow through the veins
[19:41.190 --> 19:44.270]  and causing wilting and eventual plant collapse.
[19:45.310 --> 19:47.210]  This is most often seen
[19:47.210 --> 19:49.590]  when you have very small root development.
[19:50.430 --> 19:54.470]  So if there's weak roots going into your field
[19:54.470 --> 19:56.190]  in the beginning of the season,
[19:56.190 --> 19:58.390]  your plants might be more susceptible
[19:58.390 --> 19:59.750]  to some of these root rots.
[20:01.550 --> 20:05.730]  A similar pathogen that causes root rot and plant collapse
[20:05.730 --> 20:07.250]  are Pythium root rots.
[20:08.390 --> 20:10.810]  It's important to note that Pythium isn't a true fungus,
[20:10.810 --> 20:12.370]  it's an oomycete or a water mold,
[20:12.370 --> 20:14.070]  which I'll discuss more coming up.
[20:15.670 --> 20:18.230]  Root rot in larger plants can be observed
[20:18.230 --> 20:19.890]  in the field like this here.
[20:21.370 --> 20:23.790]  In smaller seedling production,
[20:23.790 --> 20:25.090]  you can often see damping off
[20:25.090 --> 20:28.070]  caused by the same species of Pythium,
[20:28.070 --> 20:29.470]  which I'll discuss later on.
[20:30.970 --> 20:34.670]  And root-bound transplants can be very weak,
[20:34.670 --> 20:36.170]  like I showed in the previous slide
[20:36.170 --> 20:38.670]  where you have small root development going into the field.
[20:38.670 --> 20:39.750]  Those plants will often be weak
[20:39.750 --> 20:43.050]  and more susceptible to Pythium and your other root rots.
[20:47.560 --> 20:49.380]  It's also possible to have co-infection
[20:49.380 --> 20:50.420]  with some of these pathogens,
[20:51.260 --> 20:52.820]  or a lot of these pathogens actually.
[20:52.820 --> 20:53.880]  So from this plant,
[20:53.880 --> 20:56.900]  we were able to isolate both Pythium and Fusarium,
[20:57.780 --> 21:00.020]  both contributing to the death of this plant.
[21:02.260 --> 21:05.900]  Some management strategies I'd recommend for root rots.
[21:05.900 --> 21:07.660]  Well, first we would always rely
[21:07.660 --> 21:10.120]  on some genetic resistance of host cultivars,
[21:11.020 --> 21:13.440]  which we don't really have available to us at this time.
[21:13.440 --> 21:14.580]  I'm sure we will in the future,
[21:14.580 --> 21:18.420]  but right now there's not great host resistance known.
[21:18.420 --> 21:23.420]  So we heavily rely on good sanitation practices.
[21:23.500 --> 21:25.500]  So don't move soil between fields,
[21:25.500 --> 21:28.140]  clean your farming equipment well,
[21:28.140 --> 21:29.740]  ensure adequate drainage in the field
[21:29.740 --> 21:32.300]  as these pathogens usually really like
[21:32.300 --> 21:34.120]  saturated soil and wet areas.
[21:35.660 --> 21:37.460]  Crop rotation might help.
[21:39.340 --> 21:41.900]  These pathogens often have wide host ranges,
[21:41.900 --> 21:44.660]  but depending on what you're planting, it might work.
[21:45.660 --> 21:48.100]  Labeled fungicides with substantial efficacy data
[21:48.100 --> 21:50.960]  are limited like for most of the other pathogens on hemp,
[21:51.980 --> 21:53.660]  but there are some options available.
[21:53.660 --> 21:56.300]  Just refer to product labels
[21:56.300 --> 21:59.020]  and resources from your local extension agents.
[22:00.100 --> 22:01.660]  And as I mentioned several times,
[22:01.660 --> 22:03.900]  be sure to have a healthy root system at planting.
[22:03.900 --> 22:07.520]  That's kind of your best way to ensure success going on.
[22:10.840 --> 22:14.720]  There are some products that can control Fusarium.
[22:15.160 --> 22:19.200]  Here, this was a lab in vitro assay
[22:19.200 --> 22:22.080]  showing that copper can inhibit Fusarium growth,
[22:22.080 --> 22:23.720]  at least in Coltrane lab.
[22:23.720 --> 22:28.560]  So here on the right are Fusarium colonies
[22:28.560 --> 22:32.500]  on media with no copper added.
[22:32.500 --> 22:34.280]  And then as we move across to the left,
[22:34.280 --> 22:36.640]  there's increasing concentrations of copper.
[22:36.640 --> 22:38.640]  So where you see the smaller circle in the center
[22:38.640 --> 22:41.520]  that shows that there's smaller fungal growth
[22:42.440 --> 22:44.020]  suppressed by the copper.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  So there are some potential treatment management strategies
[22:50.280 --> 22:51.640]  for these pathogens.
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.080]  I'd now like to move on to diseases caused by water molds
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.600]  or oomycetes.
[23:02.330 --> 23:04.510]  So one that we've seen several years in a row
[23:04.510 --> 23:06.850]  here in New York is hemp downy mildew.
[23:06.850 --> 23:07.910]  If you grow other crops,
[23:07.910 --> 23:10.890]  you might've heard of downy mildew and cucurbits
[23:10.890 --> 23:14.270]  or other crops that you might grow.
[23:14.270 --> 23:16.990]  Here in hemp, it's caused by the species
[23:16.990 --> 23:20.030]  Pseudoperinospora cannabina.
[23:20.030 --> 23:23.210]  We first observed it here in New York in 2020.
[23:24.390 --> 23:28.070]  And this species is most closely related to cucurbit
[23:28.070 --> 23:29.510]  and hop downy mildews.
[23:30.750 --> 23:33.130]  It only survives on plant tissue.
[23:33.130 --> 23:34.770]  It's an obligate biotroph,
[23:34.770 --> 23:37.590]  meaning that the pathogen itself
[23:37.590 --> 23:39.750]  means living plant tissue to survive on.
[23:40.830 --> 23:43.070]  And the spores can spread via the wind.
[23:43.070 --> 23:45.070]  We don't know if it's C-transmitted.
[23:45.070 --> 23:48.450]  Some species of downy mildews are.
[23:48.450 --> 23:51.030]  We just don't know enough about this yet.
[23:51.030 --> 23:53.390]  And like a lot of our other diseases,
[23:53.390 --> 23:55.830]  it thrives in cool, wet conditions.
[23:55.830 --> 23:58.910]  And then we did see this again in 2021 in New York
[23:58.910 --> 24:00.610]  and also Massachusetts.
[24:04.630 --> 24:07.610]  So the symptoms of hemp downy mildew,
[24:07.610 --> 24:10.810]  it first infects the underside of the leaf tissue,
[24:10.810 --> 24:14.310]  and you'll see those gray sporulation on the underside,
[24:14.310 --> 24:18.390]  hence the name downy on the down underside of the leaf.
[24:18.390 --> 24:21.550]  Eventually it will move to the upper surface.
[24:21.550 --> 24:24.270]  It kind of travels directly through the leaf.
[24:24.270 --> 24:26.070]  So by the time that you see these lesions
[24:26.070 --> 24:27.790]  on the upper surface of the leaf,
[24:27.790 --> 24:30.490]  the underside is probably heavily colonized.
[24:34.430 --> 24:38.550]  Hemp downy mildew produces sprangia,
[24:38.550 --> 24:40.230]  which are the asexual spores.
[24:40.230 --> 24:44.670]  These spores can move through water and the wind
[24:44.670 --> 24:46.750]  to germinate on other leaves.
[24:46.750 --> 24:51.070]  And then it does have these overwintering O spores
[24:51.070 --> 24:53.790]  that can survive on leaf litter in the soil
[24:53.790 --> 24:55.630]  and cause the disease year to year.
[24:58.980 --> 25:03.020]  Our lab is currently working on some research projects
[25:03.020 --> 25:04.460]  studying hemp downy mildew.
[25:05.740 --> 25:09.580]  Someone is screening germplasm for resistance
[25:09.580 --> 25:11.540]  to hemp downy mildew.
[25:11.540 --> 25:13.980]  We're collecting isolates across the region
[25:13.980 --> 25:15.700]  to study pathogen diversity
[25:16.700 --> 25:19.260]  and how diverse this pathogen is,
[25:20.780 --> 25:22.760]  as well as looking for control strategies,
[25:22.760 --> 25:25.920]  which is our ultimate goal for all of our disease research.
[25:27.260 --> 25:30.340]  Things that you can do to prevent hemp downy mildew
[25:30.340 --> 25:32.580]  are reducing leaf wetness by pruning,
[25:32.580 --> 25:34.900]  removing leaves and increasing air flow.
[25:37.140 --> 25:39.820]  So for the last portion of this talk,
[25:39.820 --> 25:43.400]  I'd like to focus on research results from our own lab,
[25:44.580 --> 25:46.500]  I'll focus on two projects here,
[25:46.500 --> 25:50.140]  one on powdery mildew completed by Ali Kala,
[25:50.140 --> 25:51.820]  who recently graduated,
[25:51.820 --> 25:54.140]  and my own work on pythium damping.
[25:57.100 --> 26:02.100]  So powdery mildew is a very common fungal pathogen of hemp
[26:03.540 --> 26:06.540]  that you often see in greenhouses,
[26:06.540 --> 26:10.060]  controlled environment agriculture, as well as in the field.
[26:10.060 --> 26:11.860]  It's caused by the fungal species
[26:11.860 --> 26:14.340]  Gullivino myces ambrosiae,
[26:14.340 --> 26:16.260]  and powdery mildew, as the name suggests,
[26:16.260 --> 26:18.460]  forms this white powdery mildew
[26:18.460 --> 26:20.380]  across the top of the leaf surface.
[26:20.380 --> 26:21.580]  If you zoom in closer,
[26:21.580 --> 26:25.860]  you'll see these long chains of spores
[26:25.860 --> 26:27.220]  that under the microscope
[26:27.220 --> 26:29.340]  are actually all of these asexual spores
[26:29.340 --> 26:31.560]  that stack on top of each other.
[26:31.560 --> 26:33.900]  These spores are then wind dispersed
[26:33.900 --> 26:36.380]  and easily move from plant to plant.
[26:36.380 --> 26:39.420]  So if you're moving between planting areas,
[26:39.420 --> 26:41.120]  you can easily take this with you.
[26:42.860 --> 26:45.740]  And like downy mildew,
[26:45.740 --> 26:49.380]  powdery mildew also needs living plant tissue to survive.
[26:49.380 --> 26:51.300]  I should mention that this is primarily found
[26:51.300 --> 26:53.420]  on the upper surface of the plant,
[26:54.620 --> 26:58.980]  but can really infect all above ground parts of the plant.
[27:00.020 --> 27:02.380]  You can see it colonize the flowers sometimes,
[27:02.380 --> 27:04.260]  but you'll usually first observe it
[27:04.260 --> 27:06.820]  on the upper surface of the leaves.
[27:08.340 --> 27:11.500]  Powdery mildew prefers hot, humid conditions,
[27:12.100 --> 27:12.940]  but dry leaves.
[27:13.780 --> 27:16.860]  So unlike some pathogens that require leaf wetness
[27:16.860 --> 27:18.940]  in order to disperse,
[27:18.940 --> 27:21.940]  powdery mildew spores, the asexual spores,
[27:21.940 --> 27:24.480]  will burst when they encounter water.
[27:24.480 --> 27:27.940]  So it likes high humidity, but a dry leaf surface,
[27:27.940 --> 27:30.340]  which makes greenhouses a really great spot
[27:30.340 --> 27:32.820]  for powdery mildew outbreaks to occur.
[27:37.800 --> 27:41.720]  Our lab has conducted some fungicide efficacy trials
[27:41.720 --> 27:44.120]  where the goal is to compare the efficacy
[27:44.960 --> 27:47.120]  of some products currently labeled in New York State
[27:47.120 --> 27:49.760]  for use on hemp to control hemp powdery mildew.
[27:50.640 --> 27:52.460]  And we also wanted to know
[27:52.460 --> 27:54.600]  whether powdery mildew infection itself,
[27:56.560 --> 28:00.100]  or fungicide treatment would affect cannabinoid production
[28:00.100 --> 28:01.760]  in hemp flowers.
[28:01.760 --> 28:04.860]  So we didn't know prior to this,
[28:04.860 --> 28:07.720]  if diseases themselves can alter cannabinoid production,
[28:07.720 --> 28:10.340]  and this can vary between different diseases,
[28:10.340 --> 28:12.120]  or whether these products we are applying
[28:12.120 --> 28:14.520]  might impact cannabinoid production as well.
[28:16.880 --> 28:20.080]  So the products tested in this trial
[28:20.080 --> 28:21.960]  included two biological products,
[28:21.960 --> 28:23.320]  Lifeguard and Double Nickel.
[28:24.420 --> 28:27.240]  So Matrix, a potassium silicate product,
[28:27.240 --> 28:29.180]  as well as a treatment alternating
[28:29.180 --> 28:31.400]  between Lifeguard and Double Nickel.
[28:31.400 --> 28:36.060]  We used isoxystrobin as a conventional positive control.
[28:36.060 --> 28:38.320]  However, that's not currently labeled for hemp.
[28:38.320 --> 28:41.400]  We were just able to use it in a research context.
[28:41.400 --> 28:42.820]  And then we compared all this
[28:42.820 --> 28:45.180]  to our non-treatment controls, of course.
[28:48.550 --> 28:53.250]  So these studies were carried out in 2020 and 2021.
[28:54.470 --> 28:57.110]  Since it's an obligate biotroph,
[28:57.110 --> 28:59.990]  we had to grow the inoculum on living plants
[28:59.990 --> 29:01.990]  in growth chambers.
[29:01.990 --> 29:05.470]  We then washed off the spores from leaves of those plants
[29:05.470 --> 29:08.730]  and spray inoculated plant tissue in the field.
[29:09.670 --> 29:11.670]  Plants were inoculated three different times
[29:11.670 --> 29:13.670]  in order to ensure infection.
[29:14.830 --> 29:18.310]  And then the disease severity was rated five times
[29:18.310 --> 29:21.790]  once a week, where the percent disease coverage
[29:21.790 --> 29:22.950]  was quantified.
[29:22.950 --> 29:27.470]  And this allowed us to calculate what we refer to as AUDPC,
[29:27.470 --> 29:30.470]  or the area under the disease progress curve.
[29:30.470 --> 29:31.870]  So that's essentially a measurement
[29:31.870 --> 29:34.070]  of how the disease progresses
[29:34.070 --> 29:35.630]  over the course of a growing season,
[29:35.630 --> 29:38.470]  and the greater the value, the greater the disease is.
[29:39.470 --> 29:42.230]  At the end of this growing season,
[29:42.230 --> 29:45.630]  we collected mature inflorescences,
[29:45.630 --> 29:47.190]  or cannabinoid analysis.
[29:49.470 --> 29:52.830]  Here, this graph is showing the data from 2020,
[29:52.830 --> 29:57.150]  where we used the cultivar TJ's CBD, high CBD variety.
[29:57.150 --> 30:01.190]  On the X-axis are the different fungicide treatments.
[30:01.190 --> 30:04.470]  And then on the Y-axis is our disease severity rating,
[30:04.470 --> 30:06.390]  the AUDPC.
[30:06.390 --> 30:08.430]  The greater the value on the Y-axis,
[30:09.270 --> 30:10.870]  indicates a greater disease severity.
[30:10.870 --> 30:14.030]  So we can see that our untreated controls
[30:14.030 --> 30:18.030]  had the greatest average disease severity.
[30:18.030 --> 30:22.070]  And then all of our fungicide treatments
[30:22.070 --> 30:25.070]  did decrease disease severity, at least numerically.
[30:25.070 --> 30:27.990]  Anything sharing a letter above it
[30:27.990 --> 30:32.310]  represents statistically indistinguishable treatments,
[30:32.310 --> 30:34.310]  whereas those with different letters
[30:34.310 --> 30:37.510]  are statistically different, significantly different.
[30:37.510 --> 30:41.030]  So, SilMatrix, our alternating treatment,
[30:41.030 --> 30:42.830]  Double Nickel, and Azoxystrobin,
[30:42.830 --> 30:47.430]  all significantly decreased the disease
[30:47.430 --> 30:49.510]  present of powdery mildew.
[30:52.910 --> 30:55.190]  This was repeated in 2021,
[30:55.190 --> 30:57.670]  however, using a different cultivar, white CBG,
[30:57.670 --> 31:00.710]  which in the year in between these two trials,
[31:00.710 --> 31:03.830]  we noticed was more susceptible to powdery mildew.
[31:03.830 --> 31:05.870]  So we went to see how do these products perform
[31:05.870 --> 31:08.550]  when disease pressure might be even greater.
[31:08.550 --> 31:10.230]  And again, we saw the same thing
[31:10.230 --> 31:13.070]  where untreated control had the highest level
[31:13.070 --> 31:15.070]  of powdery mildew infection.
[31:15.070 --> 31:17.470]  And then our fungicide treatments
[31:17.470 --> 31:19.470]  all seemed to be pretty effective.
[31:19.470 --> 31:22.230]  Lifeguard alone was not statistically
[31:23.990 --> 31:26.750]  significantly different from the untreated control.
[31:26.750 --> 31:29.590]  However, if you alternated Lifeguard and Double Nickel,
[31:29.590 --> 31:32.990]  or use Double Nickel or SilMatrix alone,
[31:32.990 --> 31:35.670]  you saw pretty good disease coverage.
[31:36.470 --> 31:38.110]  And this combined treatment might indicate
[31:38.110 --> 31:40.430]  that Double Nickel itself is really pulling
[31:40.430 --> 31:41.390]  most of the weight here
[31:41.390 --> 31:43.510]  and is a very effective fungicide to use.
[31:46.550 --> 31:51.550]  When we looked at the potential cannabinoid content
[31:52.470 --> 31:55.150]  of our different treatments,
[31:55.150 --> 31:57.750]  of the hemp and the different treatments,
[31:57.750 --> 32:00.910]  similar graph where we have the treatments on the X-axis,
[32:00.910 --> 32:04.230]  and here on the Y, we have total potential CBD,
[32:04.270 --> 32:07.110]  while there seems to be a bit of a gradient,
[32:07.110 --> 32:09.310]  the Y scale here is actually pretty narrow.
[32:09.310 --> 32:10.830]  So there were no significant differences
[32:10.830 --> 32:12.310]  between any of the treatments
[32:13.430 --> 32:15.590]  in any of the cannabinoids measured.
[32:15.590 --> 32:20.590]  So we quantified CBD, THC, CBG, and CBC content.
[32:21.710 --> 32:24.390]  And like I said, there were no significant differences
[32:25.310 --> 32:28.430]  in cannabinoid content in any of the fungicide treatments
[32:28.430 --> 32:31.350]  in either our 2020 or 2021 trials.
[32:31.350 --> 32:32.750]  So that's good.
[32:32.750 --> 32:35.230]  You shouldn't be having to think about fungicides
[32:35.230 --> 32:38.190]  you're applying to know whether they might impact
[32:38.190 --> 32:39.630]  what your harvest yields are.
[32:42.030 --> 32:43.950]  Likewise, when we looked at plants
[32:43.950 --> 32:45.750]  that were just infected with powdery mildew,
[32:45.750 --> 32:47.870]  we saw no significant differences
[32:47.870 --> 32:50.110]  between those infected with powdery mildew
[32:50.110 --> 32:53.750]  or those that were non-inoculated.
[32:53.750 --> 32:56.350]  And this was true in both,
[32:56.350 --> 32:58.070]  in all of the cannabinoids measured,
[32:58.070 --> 33:01.510]  THC, CBD, CBG, and CBC.
[33:01.510 --> 33:03.750]  So the pathogen infection itself
[33:03.750 --> 33:08.430]  wasn't impacting the cannabinoid content as well.
[33:11.880 --> 33:14.120]  So some conclusions and takeaways
[33:14.120 --> 33:16.640]  from this fungicide efficacy work
[33:16.640 --> 33:17.560]  are that some of the products
[33:17.560 --> 33:19.120]  that are available for growers to use now
[33:19.120 --> 33:23.480]  are effective in reducing powdery mildew, disease pressure.
[33:23.480 --> 33:25.640]  The two in our study here that worked quite well
[33:25.640 --> 33:28.800]  were Silmatrix and Double Nickel,
[33:28.800 --> 33:31.680]  but I'm sure there's other options available.
[33:31.680 --> 33:34.280]  The fungicide treatments used in this experiment
[33:34.280 --> 33:37.080]  did not impact cannabinoid production in hemp.
[33:37.080 --> 33:39.080]  And likewise, powdery mildew infection
[33:39.080 --> 33:42.280]  also did not affect cannabinoid production.
[33:45.540 --> 33:48.260]  So another component of the powdery mildew work completed
[33:48.260 --> 33:50.460]  was to identify if there's any host resistance
[33:50.460 --> 33:52.460]  to powdery mildew in hemp.
[33:52.460 --> 33:57.460]  So here we surveyed a broad genetic diversity of hemp,
[33:59.100 --> 34:02.300]  of 30 cultivars, and there were two sites of this
[34:02.340 --> 34:05.100]  in two different, on both of our campuses here in New York,
[34:05.100 --> 34:06.300]  in Geneva and Ithaca.
[34:10.640 --> 34:14.360]  So here, each graph represents one of the growing locations.
[34:14.360 --> 34:17.360]  So here was our research field in Geneva,
[34:17.360 --> 34:20.520]  and on the right is our research field in Ithaca.
[34:20.520 --> 34:23.880]  And as you can see, so on the Y-axis
[34:23.880 --> 34:26.200]  is the mean percent of diseases per plant,
[34:26.200 --> 34:27.960]  so essentially disease severity.
[34:30.040 --> 34:32.880]  And there's a very wide range of disease severity
[34:32.880 --> 34:34.840]  across our different cultivars.
[34:35.720 --> 34:38.880]  Some of them having practically no disease,
[34:38.880 --> 34:42.160]  while others are very heavily colonized
[34:42.160 --> 34:43.160]  with powdery mildew.
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.360]  So this information is very useful for plant breeders
[34:48.360 --> 34:49.920]  to identify genes of interest
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.080]  that might control disease resistance
[34:53.080 --> 34:55.720]  that can be incorporated into future breeding lines.
[34:57.520 --> 34:59.640]  So in these field trials,
[34:59.640 --> 35:01.840]  we've identified at least one potential source
[35:01.840 --> 35:04.480]  of host resistance, which is currently being used
[35:05.120 --> 35:06.160]  in the Cornell breeding program
[35:06.160 --> 35:09.920]  to breed for genetic resistance to powdery mildew and hemp.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.600]  We're continuing to screen for additional genotypes
[35:14.760 --> 35:18.240]  to allow us to identify other sources of genetic resistance,
[35:18.240 --> 35:21.240]  and this information will also go to the breeding program.
[35:22.120 --> 35:25.960]  Learning more about the pathogen itself is critical.
[35:25.960 --> 35:28.480]  We don't really know how the pathogen overwinters
[35:28.480 --> 35:31.520]  or if it sexually reproduces.
[35:31.520 --> 35:33.640]  Knowing more about the biology can allow us
[35:33.640 --> 35:36.400]  to better inform our management strategies.
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.800]  We've tested several products for powdery mildew control
[35:40.800 --> 35:43.360]  and all have been effective if they are applied
[35:43.360 --> 35:45.800]  prior to the arrival of the pathogen.
[35:45.800 --> 35:47.120]  This is really important.
[35:47.120 --> 35:49.360]  If you're trying to apply a fungicide
[35:49.360 --> 35:52.960]  after you already see infection, it's often too late.
[35:52.960 --> 35:56.100]  That's not always the case, but it's fairly common,
[35:56.100 --> 35:58.040]  especially when you're using biofungicides.
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.000]  They need to be applied very early in the season
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.120]  and prior to infection.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.360]  We were also interested in determining
[36:10.360 --> 36:13.240]  what the host range of hemp powdery mildew is.
[36:13.240 --> 36:16.160]  So other powdery mildews, there's powdery mildews
[36:16.160 --> 36:19.080]  found on many, many different plant species.
[36:19.080 --> 36:22.400]  Others often have very narrow host ranges,
[36:22.400 --> 36:25.440]  but there were reports of the species that infects hemp,
[36:25.440 --> 36:26.940]  Colobinomyces ambrygiae,
[36:27.780 --> 36:32.780]  infecting some other plant species,
[36:33.340 --> 36:36.140]  such as sunflowers, okra, and zinnia.
[36:37.260 --> 36:40.300]  And similarly, well, interestingly,
[36:40.300 --> 36:42.360]  there have been reports of a cucurbit
[36:42.360 --> 36:45.300]  powdery mildew species on hemp.
[36:45.300 --> 36:49.840]  So we want to test how true this is, how far it extends.
[36:51.780 --> 36:55.140]  So in this field trial in 2021,
[36:55.140 --> 36:59.420]  22 different cultivars of plants were inoculated
[36:59.420 --> 37:01.060]  with Colobinomyces ambrygiae,
[37:01.060 --> 37:03.460]  the hemp powdery mildew pathogen.
[37:03.460 --> 37:06.780]  And these included cucurbits, zinnia, okra, and sunflowers.
[37:09.580 --> 37:11.340]  Like our other fungicide trials,
[37:11.340 --> 37:13.460]  they were rated for disease severity,
[37:13.460 --> 37:16.060]  this time five times throughout the growing season.
[37:16.060 --> 37:18.780]  And our AUDPC, or disease severity,
[37:18.780 --> 37:22.260]  was calculated over the course of that growing season.
[37:22.260 --> 37:24.580]  We then collected powdery mildew DNA
[37:26.500 --> 37:28.660]  to identify the species causing the infection.
[37:28.660 --> 37:31.300]  So we wanted to see if what we were inoculating
[37:31.300 --> 37:34.420]  the plants with was indeed what we were seeing
[37:34.420 --> 37:37.340]  at the end of the growing season when infection was heavy,
[37:38.220 --> 37:40.540]  or if something else was moving in naturally.
[37:43.350 --> 37:47.030]  So some of the summary data from these experiments
[37:47.030 --> 37:51.790]  showed that yes, all of these different plant species
[37:51.790 --> 37:55.230]  are susceptible to hemp powdery mildew.
[37:55.230 --> 37:58.590]  However, we saw great differences between cultivars
[37:58.590 --> 38:00.450]  within these crops.
[38:00.450 --> 38:03.350]  So for example, here on the left in okra,
[38:03.350 --> 38:07.590]  one species was much more susceptible than the other.
[38:07.590 --> 38:10.070]  And this was seen in all of the different crops
[38:10.070 --> 38:11.410]  that were tested.
[38:12.350 --> 38:14.170]  So while they might be susceptible,
[38:15.310 --> 38:16.990]  there could be great variation
[38:16.990 --> 38:18.990]  depending on what cultivars you're using.
[38:21.650 --> 38:26.090]  Some of the important takeaways from our host range trial
[38:26.090 --> 38:27.490]  were that hemp powdery mildew
[38:27.490 --> 38:29.930]  caused by Golovina myces ambrogiae
[38:29.930 --> 38:31.650]  has relatively wide host range,
[38:31.650 --> 38:36.090]  including okra, sunflower hemp, sun hemp,
[38:36.090 --> 38:37.970]  zinnia, and some cucurbits.
[38:39.210 --> 38:42.850]  While cucurbits can be a host of Golovina myces ambrogiae,
[38:42.850 --> 38:44.970]  the hemp powdery mildew,
[38:44.970 --> 38:48.410]  another powdery mildew species, Podopis sproxanthii,
[38:49.170 --> 38:52.890]  was collected from more of the cucurbits
[38:52.890 --> 38:55.610]  than we collected the hemp powdery mildew from.
[38:55.610 --> 38:59.510]  So this Podopis species is the powdery mildew
[38:59.510 --> 39:02.330]  that is primarily seen on cucurbits.
[39:02.330 --> 39:05.490]  And this is what we were isolating back out from cucurbits
[39:05.490 --> 39:08.530]  that were infected with powdery mildew.
[39:08.530 --> 39:13.530]  So this is showing that this pathogen spread in naturally
[39:14.130 --> 39:17.290]  and most likely out-competed
[39:17.290 --> 39:20.210]  the species that we were inoculating with.
[39:21.850 --> 39:23.530]  There's differences in susceptibility
[39:23.530 --> 39:28.450]  to Golovina myces ambrogiae among our different cultivars.
[39:28.450 --> 39:31.210]  So this is important information
[39:31.210 --> 39:33.850]  to think about what you're planting next to each other.
[39:33.850 --> 39:35.290]  If you have hemp
[39:35.290 --> 39:37.250]  and you're concerned about powdery mildew,
[39:37.250 --> 39:40.170]  you might not want to plant some cultivars of sunflowers,
[39:40.170 --> 39:42.450]  for example, that are very susceptible
[39:42.450 --> 39:45.330]  and can bring in more powdery mildew.
[39:48.290 --> 39:50.970]  And then finally, I'd like to move on
[39:50.970 --> 39:54.890]  to my own dissertation work on Pythium dampenol.
[39:54.890 --> 39:59.650]  So like I mentioned previously with Pythium,
[39:59.650 --> 40:03.610]  it's an Oomyc pathogen here on the bottom left.
[40:03.610 --> 40:07.370]  And these are two healthy seedlings with quite long roots.
[40:07.370 --> 40:09.570]  And then these top two were inoculated
[40:09.570 --> 40:11.450]  with Pythium myriodala.
[40:11.450 --> 40:14.250]  And as you can see, they really did not get very far
[40:14.250 --> 40:16.970]  before the plant fully died
[40:16.970 --> 40:19.490]  and did not develop extensive roots.
[40:20.970 --> 40:24.650]  Here is just a healthy flat of hemp seedlings growing
[40:24.650 --> 40:26.730]  compared to those inoculated with Pythium.
[40:26.730 --> 40:28.450]  So this pathogen is really capable
[40:28.450 --> 40:31.490]  of completely wiping out seedlings.
[40:34.320 --> 40:36.520]  This is often seen in greenhouse production
[40:36.520 --> 40:38.040]  where you have small plants growing.
[40:38.040 --> 40:41.480]  So maybe if you're growing hemp baby greens,
[40:41.480 --> 40:44.320]  this is a pathogen that you might be more concerned about
[40:44.320 --> 40:46.640]  where there's high moisture content
[40:46.640 --> 40:48.720]  and young, very susceptible plants.
[40:51.800 --> 40:54.720]  So while Pythium dampenol can be caused
[40:54.720 --> 40:57.080]  by many different species of Pythium,
[40:57.080 --> 40:59.880]  one that I focused on was Pythium myriodala.
[40:59.880 --> 41:03.480]  It was first reported on hemp in Connecticut in 2018.
[41:03.480 --> 41:06.080]  Symptoms include wilting of the leaves,
[41:06.080 --> 41:08.680]  necrotic lesions on the roots,
[41:08.680 --> 41:11.200]  and then the outer cortex of the roots
[41:11.200 --> 41:15.800]  will slough off from the inner vasculature
[41:15.800 --> 41:17.000]  of the root system.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.840]  And if this progresses long enough,
[41:20.840 --> 41:22.400]  your seedling will damp off and die.
[41:22.400 --> 41:24.840]  And this whole process doesn't take very long
[41:24.840 --> 41:26.240]  in very young seedlings.
[41:27.280 --> 41:28.920]  It's a soil-dwelling water mold
[41:28.920 --> 41:30.880]  that affects the root cap of the plant.
[41:31.760 --> 41:35.200]  So again, this really prefers cool, wet conditions.
[41:35.200 --> 41:37.480]  These are the sporangia.
[41:37.480 --> 41:40.560]  Similar to the sporangia that we saw in downy mildew,
[41:41.400 --> 41:43.920]  these produce the swimming asexual spores
[41:43.920 --> 41:45.520]  that can move through the water.
[41:49.660 --> 41:52.900]  So part of my research is determining
[41:52.900 --> 41:55.780]  whether we can control soil-borne pathogens
[41:55.780 --> 41:57.340]  via seed treatments.
[41:59.300 --> 42:01.140]  The objective of this work was to determine
[42:01.140 --> 42:03.820]  if current fungicide seed treatments available
[42:03.820 --> 42:06.940]  improve germination and seedling viability
[42:06.940 --> 42:10.100]  on both un-inoculated or inoculated seeds
[42:10.100 --> 42:11.620]  with Pythium myriodala.
[42:11.620 --> 42:13.580]  And we also included Pythium ultimum,
[42:13.580 --> 42:17.580]  another species of Pythium that causes damping off.
[42:20.020 --> 42:23.460]  Here, I tested three different fungicide seed treatments.
[42:24.620 --> 42:27.580]  There was AmeriCop, which is a copper hydroxide product.
[42:28.460 --> 42:32.980]  ProBioUltem, which I'll refer to as PBU,
[42:34.380 --> 42:37.140]  is another copper hydroxide product.
[42:37.140 --> 42:40.580]  And then a phosphate product, Prudent 44 Neutral.
[42:41.660 --> 42:45.700]  And here we use the hemp cultivar Vega,
[42:46.580 --> 42:49.020]  and these seeds were all treated here at Cornell.
[42:52.220 --> 42:54.660]  In this experiment, I sowed the seeds directly
[42:54.660 --> 42:56.700]  into these styrofoam trays,
[42:56.700 --> 42:58.900]  which were then placed in a basin of water
[42:58.900 --> 43:02.140]  where the Pythium inoculum was directly added.
[43:02.140 --> 43:04.020]  So this system was used
[43:04.020 --> 43:06.140]  so that we can ensure Pythium infection.
[43:06.140 --> 43:10.060]  Like I said, this really needs a wet environment to survive.
[43:10.860 --> 43:13.140]  So by adding the inoculum into this water,
[43:13.140 --> 43:15.540]  we were able to get a heavy infection.
[43:16.700 --> 43:19.900]  And then, so we had flats that were inoculated
[43:19.900 --> 43:22.260]  with Pythium myriodala, Pythium ultimum,
[43:22.260 --> 43:24.020]  or that were left non-inoculated.
[43:24.020 --> 43:25.860]  And all of the different seed treatments were included
[43:25.860 --> 43:27.820]  in each of the inoculum sources.
[43:32.720 --> 43:35.600]  For 22 days, the number of germinated seeds,
[43:35.600 --> 43:38.400]  seedlings which died post-emergence or damped off,
[43:38.400 --> 43:40.760]  and the number of healthy seeds were recorded.
[43:41.640 --> 43:44.520]  Here are two flats at the end of this experiment.
[43:44.520 --> 43:46.040]  Here on the left is a flat
[43:46.040 --> 43:48.040]  that was inoculated with Pythium ultimum.
[43:48.040 --> 43:51.640]  We can see drastically reduced root development
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.480]  and a lot of dead necrotic tissue in the shoots.
[43:57.480 --> 44:00.600]  Whereas compared to the un-inoculated flat,
[44:00.600 --> 44:02.120]  there's extensive root growth
[44:02.120 --> 44:03.920]  and healthy green seedlings growing.
[44:08.300 --> 44:11.540]  These two graphs show the percentage of healthy seedlings.
[44:11.540 --> 44:14.860]  Here on the left, we're looking at 13 days post-inoculation.
[44:16.220 --> 44:19.580]  On the Y-axis is just the percentage of healthy seedlings.
[44:19.580 --> 44:20.820]  And then here are bars
[44:20.820 --> 44:24.100]  for the three different inoculum types.
[44:24.100 --> 44:27.580]  So the first two are the two species of Pythium,
[44:27.580 --> 44:29.260]  plants inoculated with those,
[44:29.260 --> 44:32.260]  and then our non-inoculated flats.
[44:32.260 --> 44:33.820]  13 days post-inoculation,
[44:33.820 --> 44:35.660]  we didn't see any statistical differences
[44:35.660 --> 44:37.020]  between these treatments.
[44:37.020 --> 44:40.660]  However, after 22 days,
[44:40.660 --> 44:43.540]  we did see a significantly reduced number,
[44:43.540 --> 44:45.740]  percentage of healthy seedlings
[44:45.740 --> 44:48.220]  in our Pythium inoculated treatments
[44:48.220 --> 44:51.500]  compared to the non-inoculated control.
[44:51.500 --> 44:52.340]  So that's good.
[44:52.340 --> 44:55.060]  That shows that our inoculation strategies worked.
[44:56.300 --> 44:58.780]  And then when we look at the seed treatment data,
[44:59.780 --> 45:01.860]  here each panel represents
[45:01.860 --> 45:05.180]  one of the three different inoculum sources.
[45:05.180 --> 45:08.540]  So these first two are two species of Pythium.
[45:08.540 --> 45:12.020]  And then this on the right is our non-inoculated group.
[45:12.020 --> 45:14.380]  And then across the X-axis here
[45:14.380 --> 45:17.380]  are the different fungicide seed treatments.
[45:17.380 --> 45:20.700]  On the Y-axis is the percentage of healthy seedlings.
[45:22.300 --> 45:27.300]  So as represented by the NS notation here, not significant,
[45:27.420 --> 45:30.020]  there were no significant differences
[45:30.020 --> 45:33.340]  in any of the seed treatments compared to the control.
[45:33.340 --> 45:35.860]  So none of these seed treatments statistically
[45:36.820 --> 45:40.260]  significantly improved the percentage of healthy seedlings
[45:40.260 --> 45:42.020]  at 13 days post-inoculation.
[45:42.940 --> 45:46.540]  When we jump ahead to 22 days post-inoculation,
[45:46.540 --> 45:50.900]  we see that the un-inoculated groups remain much higher
[45:51.820 --> 45:53.740]  than those inoculated.
[45:53.740 --> 45:56.460]  But again, we don't see any significant differences
[45:56.460 --> 45:58.580]  when we compare the untreated
[45:58.580 --> 46:00.980]  to those treated with the fungicides.
[46:00.980 --> 46:03.780]  We do however see some numerical differences
[46:04.620 --> 46:08.660]  where AmeriCop and the PBU film coats
[46:09.740 --> 46:14.740]  numerically at least improved some healthy seedling rates.
[46:17.620 --> 46:21.180]  So in summary here, both species of Pythium
[46:21.180 --> 46:23.100]  that we inoculated with reduced the number
[46:23.100 --> 46:26.540]  of healthy seedlings through damping off.
[46:26.540 --> 46:28.820]  None of the seed treatments tested
[46:28.820 --> 46:32.420]  significantly increased the percentage of healthy seedlings.
[46:32.420 --> 46:36.180]  However, like I mentioned AmeriCop and PBU
[46:36.180 --> 46:39.860]  did numerically increase the number of healthy seedlings.
[46:39.860 --> 46:41.820]  These products will further be evaluated
[46:41.820 --> 46:44.620]  in other environmental conditions in the field.
[46:44.620 --> 46:48.340]  Here we, like I showed, these were in very wet soils.
[46:48.340 --> 46:50.340]  It'll be interesting to see how these products perform
[46:50.340 --> 46:53.980]  in field soils with other soil-borne pathogens
[46:53.980 --> 46:56.740]  and natural sources of inoculum.
[47:00.140 --> 47:02.340]  And then some general conclusions and takeaways
[47:03.180 --> 47:07.460]  from this seminar are that as you're probably guessing
[47:07.460 --> 47:09.820]  by now, hemp is susceptible to a very wide array
[47:09.820 --> 47:14.820]  of pathogens of bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes.
[47:17.020 --> 47:19.500]  Cultural practices are very important.
[47:19.500 --> 47:22.540]  These include things like sanitation,
[47:22.540 --> 47:24.580]  cleaning your farm equipment frequently
[47:25.580 --> 47:29.220]  and any pruning material, increasing airflow
[47:30.220 --> 47:33.220]  that can prevent leaf wetness
[47:33.220 --> 47:36.460]  from stagnant water sitting on your leaves,
[47:36.460 --> 47:40.140]  avoid planting in wet soils, rotate to crops
[47:40.140 --> 47:42.220]  that might be non-host of problematic pathogens
[47:42.220 --> 47:45.500]  in your system, and use resistant cultivars
[47:45.500 --> 47:48.100]  if they are available or when they become available.
[47:49.380 --> 47:51.140]  Fungicides available are limited,
[47:51.140 --> 47:53.940]  but the number of registered products is growing.
[47:53.940 --> 47:58.260]  It's just very important to read and follow all labels
[47:58.260 --> 48:00.580]  on your pesticide products and ensure
[48:00.580 --> 48:03.620]  that the product is approved for use in your location.
[48:06.300 --> 48:09.820]  With that, I would like to thank all of my funding sources.
[48:09.820 --> 48:12.900]  You funded our lab and all of our work here,
[48:12.900 --> 48:14.180]  New York State Ag and Markets,
[48:14.180 --> 48:16.540]  Empire State Development Corporation,
[48:16.540 --> 48:19.980]  and all of our collaborators here at Cornell.
[48:19.980 --> 48:22.780]  And I would be happy to answer some of the questions
[48:22.780 --> 48:24.940]  in the Q&A box now.
[48:25.940 --> 48:27.260]  Yeah, thanks so much, Patrick.
[48:27.260 --> 48:29.420]  Yeah, please feel free to open that box
[48:29.420 --> 48:31.460]  and go through all the questions.
[48:34.580 --> 48:36.140]  So the first question here is,
[48:36.140 --> 48:38.420]  why was there not great correlation
[48:38.420 --> 48:40.660]  in variety susceptibility
[48:40.660 --> 48:44.140]  at the two powdery mildew testing locations?
[48:46.820 --> 48:50.700]  So these were slightly different environments.
[48:51.860 --> 48:54.540]  The varieties that were more susceptible
[48:55.140 --> 48:58.420]  in one location were generally more susceptible
[48:58.420 --> 48:59.580]  in the other location.
[48:59.580 --> 49:02.020]  They didn't necessarily line up in the exact order,
[49:02.020 --> 49:04.380]  but for example, the first light 58
[49:04.380 --> 49:08.820]  that had very low powdery mildew infection
[49:08.820 --> 49:11.860]  in one location also had very low infection
[49:11.860 --> 49:13.900]  in the other location.
[49:13.900 --> 49:15.780]  Even if it wasn't number one,
[49:15.780 --> 49:17.620]  they still generally lined up.
[49:17.620 --> 49:20.460]  But environmental conditions can always impact
[49:20.460 --> 49:21.500]  some of those we see.
[49:22.180 --> 49:24.580]  Have there been any studies performed
[49:24.580 --> 49:28.260]  that track the efficacy of applying beneficial microbials
[49:28.260 --> 49:30.860]  generated from actively aerated compost
[49:30.860 --> 49:33.060]  to use applied to foliar surfaces
[49:33.060 --> 49:35.540]  as a preventative for various pathogens?
[49:36.740 --> 49:39.700]  There's a lot of work currently happening
[49:41.340 --> 49:44.340]  with microbial additives.
[49:46.580 --> 49:51.420]  I'm not so sure about examples of using microbial additives
[49:52.300 --> 49:57.300]  or using compost teas as preventatives for pathogens.
[49:58.020 --> 50:01.420]  However, some of the products we tested are biofungicides,
[50:02.380 --> 50:04.900]  which can control, I showed some efficacy data
[50:04.900 --> 50:07.940]  for biofungicides controlling powdery mildew.
[50:07.940 --> 50:12.940]  And we're also testing those for septoria control as well.
[50:13.580 --> 50:15.780]  So there are a lot of biological products.
[50:18.020 --> 50:20.820]  Some of my upcoming work will be testing
[50:21.220 --> 50:23.180]  beneficial microbials as well.
[50:23.180 --> 50:25.820]  I think a lot of that research is currently in the works.
[50:27.020 --> 50:29.980]  Are there any known instances with utilizing biopesticides
[50:29.980 --> 50:32.300]  or beneficial microbes that may cause end products
[50:32.300 --> 50:34.260]  to fail compliance testing
[50:34.260 --> 50:37.300]  for total yeast and mold or mycotoxins?
[50:37.300 --> 50:39.060]  That's a very interesting question.
[50:40.140 --> 50:44.980]  So the short answer is a lot of that isn't known.
[50:44.980 --> 50:49.180]  There's projects that are taking place very soon.
[50:49.180 --> 50:51.500]  My lab is going to be completing some work
[50:51.500 --> 50:54.140]  seeing the longevity of microbial products
[50:54.140 --> 50:55.780]  in the inflorescences and leaves.
[50:57.660 --> 51:00.380]  And I believe that legislation is still working out
[51:00.380 --> 51:05.380]  some of the thresholds of what is compliant
[51:05.500 --> 51:07.780]  when using some of those microbial products.
[51:09.620 --> 51:12.020]  So if you're concerned about that,
[51:12.020 --> 51:14.620]  you can apply them earlier in the season
[51:15.860 --> 51:19.020]  and follow any post-harvest interval recommendations
[51:19.860 --> 51:21.540]  that the label might give you.
[51:22.580 --> 51:24.460]  But yeah, a lot more of that information
[51:24.460 --> 51:27.300]  will be coming in the future.
[51:31.540 --> 51:34.300]  And someone said, speaking of sanitation,
[51:34.300 --> 51:36.940]  how did I clean seeds for these studies?
[51:38.780 --> 51:40.660]  Yeah, so on the seed treatment slide,
[51:40.660 --> 51:42.500]  I think I had in the bullet point
[51:42.500 --> 51:44.820]  that the seeds were cleaned and sized.
[51:44.820 --> 51:48.540]  This essentially referred to that the seeds
[51:48.540 --> 51:51.020]  were sifted through the sieve
[51:51.020 --> 51:53.020]  to give us a certain size seed.
[51:53.020 --> 51:54.980]  So anything that was below a certain threshold
[51:54.980 --> 51:56.100]  wasn't being included.
[51:57.540 --> 52:01.340]  In these studies, the seedlings weren't sterilized prior.
[52:01.340 --> 52:04.780]  If you're worried about contaminated seed lots,
[52:04.780 --> 52:07.620]  sometimes you can do heat treatments
[52:07.620 --> 52:11.500]  or short soaks in diluted bleach
[52:11.500 --> 52:13.540]  and then rinse your seeds well,
[52:13.540 --> 52:15.180]  but that's not always necessary.
[52:15.700 --> 52:19.220]  Are there any studies focusing
[52:19.220 --> 52:21.220]  on additional powdery mildew species
[52:21.220 --> 52:22.820]  other than those mentioned?
[52:22.820 --> 52:24.700]  In the literature, I have seen
[52:24.700 --> 52:26.780]  both Golovino mysis ambrosiae
[52:26.780 --> 52:29.580]  and Golovino mysis spadichius reported,
[52:29.580 --> 52:32.900]  and at times have seen these species
[52:32.900 --> 52:35.740]  synonymized through fungal taxonomy databases.
[52:35.740 --> 52:38.540]  Do not come to a consensus at this matter.
[52:38.540 --> 52:43.380]  Yes, so I actually eliminated that from the slide
[52:43.380 --> 52:45.140]  for the sake of simplicity,
[52:46.100 --> 52:47.300]  but so Allie Callow was the student
[52:47.300 --> 52:48.860]  who completed a lot of this work.
[52:48.860 --> 52:53.180]  When she first started her PhD work,
[52:53.180 --> 52:54.940]  the hemp powdery mildew was characterized
[52:54.940 --> 52:57.100]  as Golovino mysis spadichius,
[52:57.980 --> 53:00.540]  and that's where she saw the reports
[53:00.540 --> 53:05.540]  of this powdery mildew infecting other plant hosts as well,
[53:05.900 --> 53:07.180]  so the okra and sunflowers,
[53:07.180 --> 53:08.820]  and that's what sparked the interest
[53:08.820 --> 53:10.060]  in that host range study.
[53:10.700 --> 53:15.700]  Then taxonomists, mycologists have reclassified
[53:17.100 --> 53:22.100]  this clade of Golovino mysis spadichius to ambrosiae,
[53:24.540 --> 53:26.540]  so everything that we studied
[53:26.540 --> 53:28.620]  was originally classified as spadichius,
[53:28.620 --> 53:31.140]  and then later grouped into ambrosiae,
[53:32.060 --> 53:33.340]  so I believe that ambrosiae
[53:33.340 --> 53:35.260]  is just the updated term for that.
[53:36.420 --> 53:38.100]  Taxonomists are always arguing,
[53:38.100 --> 53:39.940]  and things are ever-changing,
[53:40.780 --> 53:41.620]  so I certainly understand
[53:41.620 --> 53:44.300]  the confusion and questions there,
[53:47.580 --> 53:49.740]  and that is the last of the questions
[53:49.740 --> 53:51.420]  I have in the Q&A box.
[53:53.660 --> 53:57.020]  If there's anything else, I would be happy to answer,
[53:57.020 --> 53:59.780]  but otherwise, I greatly appreciate all of you
[53:59.780 --> 54:02.420]  coming to this talk and hope that was helpful for you.
[54:04.340 --> 54:05.580]  Thank you so much, Patrick.
[54:05.580 --> 54:07.060]  That was a great presentation,
[54:08.060 --> 54:10.260]  and thank you, Larry, and all of you guys
[54:10.260 --> 54:12.180]  for joining us today for this webinar.
[54:13.060 --> 54:15.740]  Please join us in two weeks, April 19th,
[54:15.740 --> 54:17.220]  for our seventh webinar,
[54:17.220 --> 54:20.140]  focused on hemp harvest by Stephen Philpott
[54:20.140 --> 54:21.700]  from Chicago State University.
[54:26.660 --> 54:30.100]  This has been a production of Cornell University
