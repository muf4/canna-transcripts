[00:00.120 --> 00:04.120]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.120 --> 00:10.350]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:10.350 --> 00:12.690]  So thank you very much, Larry, for those kind words.
[00:12.690 --> 00:16.390]  Today I'm going to be talking about the research that I've been doing for my thesis titled
[00:16.390 --> 00:21.350]  elucidating the genetic control of qualitative traits in hemp.
[00:21.350 --> 00:24.030]  Before I get into the research, I'd like to give a little bit of a background of what
[00:24.030 --> 00:25.030]  hemp is.
[00:25.030 --> 00:32.210]  So hemp is cannabis sativa, a species that it shares with the currently federally illegal
[00:33.210 --> 00:38.010]  the difference between hemp and marijuana is the concentration of one chemical, and
[00:38.010 --> 00:40.050]  that is THC, which is psychoactive.
[00:40.050 --> 00:48.330]  Notably, hemp has less than 0.3% THC, while marijuana has greater than 0.3% THC.
[00:48.330 --> 00:52.770]  And this is a very important number, and I'll get back to it later on in the presentation.
[00:52.770 --> 00:57.650]  Hemp is usually dioecious, diploid, and short day, but there are some exceptions to this,
[00:57.650 --> 00:59.450]  and I'll talk about those later as well.
[00:59.490 --> 01:02.890]  What's really interesting about hemp is that it's really a multi-purpose crop.
[01:02.890 --> 01:08.370]  There are a few major market classes that hemp can be grown for, the three most important
[01:08.370 --> 01:12.810]  of which are grain, fiber, and inflorescence.
[01:12.810 --> 01:18.090]  So at the moment right now, the smallest market, both in terms of acreage and in terms of economic
[01:18.090 --> 01:22.090]  impact, and at least in the United States, is hemp for grain.
[01:22.090 --> 01:26.210]  That being said, I think that there's great opportunities for hemp as a grain crop, and
[01:26.570 --> 01:30.290]  for the people who are here, please help yourself to the snacks in the back, which I largely
[01:30.290 --> 01:33.730]  made using hemp hearts as pictured here.
[01:33.730 --> 01:40.730]  So these hemp hearts, which are the seed once you remove the hard shell on the outside,
[01:40.730 --> 01:43.090]  they've got a bit of a reputation as a superfood.
[01:43.090 --> 01:48.610]  They're relatively high in oil with a three to one omega-six to omega-three fatty acid
[01:48.610 --> 01:52.770]  profile, which is largely accepted to be optimal for human health.
[01:52.770 --> 01:55.530]  They're high in highly digestible protein.
[01:55.850 --> 02:02.770]  Today you can buy this grain hemp in many places, either whole with that shell on, de-hulled,
[02:02.770 --> 02:06.530]  as you can see in the back with these hearts, this picture up here.
[02:06.530 --> 02:12.370]  You can also either extract the oil from the whole seeds or the de-hulled seeds, and the
[02:12.370 --> 02:19.170]  remaining protein-rich cake can be further processed to create protein isolates.
[02:19.170 --> 02:24.890]  So the next largest major market class of hemp is for fiber, and the part of the plant
[02:24.930 --> 02:28.610]  that you grow hemp for for fiber is the stem.
[02:28.610 --> 02:33.690]  So what happens if you cut that stem right across, you would see two distinct parts of
[02:33.690 --> 02:34.690]  the stem.
[02:34.690 --> 02:39.330]  You'd see the outer vast fibers, which are strong, durable, and can be treated to make
[02:39.330 --> 02:43.570]  some very nice textiles like this tie that I'm wearing right here.
[02:43.570 --> 02:49.530]  The inside is a woody herd, and it can basically be used for anything that you could use wood
[02:49.570 --> 02:50.570]  for.
[02:50.570 --> 02:56.450]  So it's very commonly pulped or chopped into small pieces for animal bedding.
[02:56.450 --> 03:00.010]  So what's great about the hemp is that it can be grown all over.
[03:00.010 --> 03:04.790]  It's widely adapted to very different regions, and you can get potentially very high yields.
[03:04.790 --> 03:10.130]  This is a field that we grew last year, and some of these plants were 16 feet tall, and
[03:10.130 --> 03:17.170]  we were getting upwards of 20 megagrams per hectare of dry, redded fiber from these plants.
[03:17.170 --> 03:25.330]  In fact, the biomass of these plants is so prodigious, it's at least comparable to the
[03:25.330 --> 03:31.130]  best willow lines that we have been testing as the other part of Larry's program.
[03:31.130 --> 03:35.930]  So the last major market class for hemp, which is by far and away the most profitable right
[03:35.930 --> 03:41.690]  now, but it has been shrinking greatly since 2019, is inflorescence hemp.
[03:41.690 --> 03:46.650]  So inflorescence hemp is usually grown for the cannabinoids and the terpenes, which reach
[03:46.650 --> 03:51.450]  their highest concentration in unpollinated female inflorescences.
[03:51.450 --> 03:55.850]  So while the other two major market classes, grain and fiber, are mostly grown as a row
[03:55.850 --> 03:59.650]  crop, the inflorescence hemp is much more horticultural.
[03:59.650 --> 04:02.090]  We'll grow them on a plant-by-plant basis.
[04:02.090 --> 04:06.410]  We'll go through extraordinary lengths to make sure that there's no pollination and
[04:06.410 --> 04:14.290]  no males in the field, and we'll put a lot more effort into growing these plants.
[04:14.290 --> 04:20.410]  So it's a very interesting market in that right now there seems to be a split in what
[04:20.410 --> 04:22.810]  people grow inflorescence hemp for.
[04:22.810 --> 04:28.370]  On the one hand, there's the smokable flower, and then on the other hand, it is the extract
[04:28.370 --> 04:32.450]  of this high CBD with the terpenes.
[04:32.450 --> 04:38.450]  These are forming very different market classes, and we're seeing it evolve in real time.
[04:38.450 --> 04:41.690]  So for my thesis, what I really wanted to address were some of the major problems that
[04:41.690 --> 04:42.690]  we're facing hemp.
[04:42.690 --> 04:43.690]  So hemp is a very new crop.
[04:44.090 --> 04:51.410]  It was first able to be grown in the US with a research license in the 2014 Farm Bill.
[04:51.410 --> 04:55.810]  So there's a lot of new challenges that face this crop.
[04:55.810 --> 05:01.490]  And there was an interesting study published by Shelby Ellison from University of Wisconsin-Madison
[05:01.490 --> 05:08.430]  who did a poll of stakeholders in the hemp business, and far and away, the most important
[05:08.430 --> 05:13.510]  aspect for hemp was that of regulatory research.
[05:14.330 --> 05:18.950]  So the major plant here was that the plants that were being grown produced too much THC.
[05:18.950 --> 05:22.910]  So the big question was, what makes these plants produce too much THC?
[05:22.910 --> 05:27.970]  Because we don't want to plant a hemp field and have it actually be marijuana.
[05:27.970 --> 05:31.870]  Other major problems that I felt that I could address with my thesis were a lack of adapted
[05:31.870 --> 05:34.310]  cultivars and a lack of stable cultivars.
[05:34.310 --> 05:38.190]  And a major thing that motivated a lot of my research was the development of molecular
[05:38.190 --> 05:43.390]  markers which could aid in developing adapted and stable cultivars.
[05:43.470 --> 05:45.910]  So the big problem, hemp going hot.
[05:45.910 --> 05:49.630]  So hemp producing more than 0.3% THC.
[05:49.630 --> 05:53.550]  So we really want to figure out how can we stay below that threshold.
[05:53.550 --> 05:57.710]  So in plant breeding, we generally like to partition things into genetic causes, environmental
[05:57.710 --> 06:00.390]  causes, or the interaction between the two.
[06:00.390 --> 06:04.430]  So this is sort of a nature versus nurture idea.
[06:04.430 --> 06:09.990]  And if we look at what was commonly believed as recently as a few years ago, the big thing
[06:09.990 --> 06:13.130]  that caused hemp to go hot would be stress.
[06:13.130 --> 06:24.490]  So if we look at this here, these top two are hemp sites which very clearly state growers
[06:24.490 --> 06:29.650]  need to be aware that plant stresses can result in THC spikes or any plant stress can tip
[06:29.650 --> 06:33.930]  it over the 0.3% THC and the whole crop is mowed down.
[06:33.930 --> 06:38.930]  And even if we look at, for instance, cooperative extension sites in 2018, we have here the
[06:38.930 --> 06:42.350]  main things that can cause THC spikes are stressors.
[06:42.350 --> 06:47.750]  And there was even actually an article in the New York Times about a quirk in the chemistry
[06:47.750 --> 06:52.290]  of hemp plants that can cause them to overproduce THC when stressed.
[06:52.290 --> 06:57.630]  So coming into it, it seemed like everybody thought it was the environment.
[06:57.630 --> 07:01.930]  So overall, we wanted to address this.
[07:01.930 --> 07:04.870]  We started addressing this in 2018 with our cultivar trials.
[07:04.870 --> 07:10.370]  And I have here the CBD and THC levels of a few different cultivars, grain cultivars
[07:10.410 --> 07:16.890]  in blue, fiber cultivars in orange, dual purpose grain and fiber cultivars in gray, and then
[07:16.890 --> 07:19.290]  our CBD cultivars in teal over there.
[07:19.290 --> 07:24.970]  And what you can see is that some of these grain cultivars produce mostly CBD, but a
[07:24.970 --> 07:27.610]  very small amount and a much smaller amount of THC.
[07:27.610 --> 07:31.730]  But some of those cultivars grown under the same conditions, the same stressors, they
[07:31.730 --> 07:34.930]  produce way more THC well over that threshold.
[07:34.930 --> 07:40.330]  And you see that same genetic difference looking at these different cultivars, grain,
[07:40.330 --> 07:42.770]  fiber, and dual purpose.
[07:42.770 --> 07:47.490]  And when we look at the CBD production, things get a little bit stranger.
[07:47.490 --> 07:54.130]  So with the CBD cultivars, we measured things on a per plant basis as opposed to a per plot
[07:54.130 --> 07:56.570]  basis like we did with the other ones.
[07:56.570 --> 08:01.310]  And when we average it out by cultivar, you can see here it's just kind of wild.
[08:01.390 --> 08:06.790]  But one important thing to note is that everything we tested was considerably above that 0.3%
[08:06.790 --> 08:08.790]  THC threshold.
[08:08.790 --> 08:14.070]  So one of the things that we did, because we had this per plant basis of cannabinoids,
[08:14.070 --> 08:17.550]  we plotted the CBD against the THC.
[08:17.550 --> 08:23.230]  And rather remarkably, we see three distinct groups when we look at this per plant CBD
[08:23.230 --> 08:24.630]  to THC ratio.
[08:24.630 --> 08:29.810]  We have that one group at the top that's almost entirely THC and very close to zero CBD.
[08:29.810 --> 08:32.450]  We have about equal CBD and THC.
[08:32.450 --> 08:38.050]  And then we have that group at the bottom, which is mostly CBD.
[08:38.050 --> 08:41.250]  If I can just give...
[08:41.250 --> 08:44.730]  There we go.
[08:44.730 --> 08:47.990]  So we aren't actually the first ones to see this phenomenon.
[08:47.990 --> 08:52.610]  This has been the subject of a lot of research from many different groups.
[08:52.610 --> 09:00.450]  And what has been found out is that whether a plant produces majority CBD, majority THC,
[09:00.450 --> 09:05.650]  or about equal of both, can really be attributed to one single locus, which is called the B
[09:05.650 --> 09:06.650]  locus.
[09:06.650 --> 09:10.090]  So when you get into the nitty gritty molecular genetics, it's kind of a mess.
[09:10.090 --> 09:12.890]  But from a plant breeding perspective, it doesn't really matter.
[09:12.890 --> 09:18.370]  All that really matters is that we have a BD allele, which has an active CBD synthase
[09:18.370 --> 09:20.650]  and no active THC synthase.
[09:20.690 --> 09:26.530]  We have a BT allele, which has active THC synthase and no active CBD synthase.
[09:26.530 --> 09:30.690]  And because hemp is usually diploid, you can have a heterozygous case.
[09:30.690 --> 09:33.010]  So it has active copies of both.
[09:33.010 --> 09:34.970]  And this maps on exactly to what we saw.
[09:34.970 --> 09:39.770]  We have chemotype one plants, which are almost entirely THC, chemotype two, which are about
[09:39.770 --> 09:44.210]  equal, they tend to skew a little towards CBD, and then chemotype three, which are majority
[09:44.210 --> 09:45.950]  CBD.
[09:45.950 --> 09:49.850]  So one of the first things I did when I started working here was develop molecular markers,
[09:50.050 --> 09:52.250]  which could distinguish these loci.
[09:52.250 --> 09:59.410]  And when I applied that to my CBD trials on the per plant basis, I saw perfect segregation
[09:59.410 --> 10:04.930]  into these three distinct groups, which map onto these chemotypes that have been previously
[10:04.930 --> 10:06.690]  described.
[10:06.690 --> 10:11.130]  What's really notable, though, is that if we look at these blue dots here, which are
[10:11.130 --> 10:18.250]  those chemotype three plants, the ones that don't have an active THC synthase, even when
[10:18.250 --> 10:25.730]  you go above around 7% total potential CBD, you get above 0.3% THC.
[10:25.730 --> 10:30.650]  So it doesn't appear that simply being chemotype three is enough to keep you under that total
[10:30.650 --> 10:33.970]  potential THC.
[10:33.970 --> 10:38.530]  So given my last slide, I think it's pretty clear that genetics has a very strong role
[10:38.530 --> 10:41.210]  in determining if THC goes high.
[10:41.210 --> 10:46.950]  So we have a theory that in the past, people were sampling a stressed plant that happened
[10:46.950 --> 10:51.710]  to be chemotype one or two, and then they saw that it had extreme amounts of THC, and
[10:51.710 --> 10:55.830]  then they blamed the stress rather than the genetics.
[10:55.830 --> 11:00.630]  So even given all that, it's still possible that there was an environmental effect, either
[11:00.630 --> 11:04.350]  on total THC or on that ratio of CBD to THC.
[11:04.350 --> 11:07.870]  In our previous trials, we weren't actively trying to kill the plants, so it's hard to
[11:07.870 --> 11:11.830]  really say that we were stressing them out.
[11:11.830 --> 11:14.070]  So we stressed them out and tried to kill them.
[11:14.190 --> 11:19.550]  We did one site with three distinct chemotype three cultivars in a split pot design, and
[11:19.550 --> 11:21.990]  we applied a few different stresses to these plants.
[11:21.990 --> 11:25.910]  We had a control plot, we sprayed some with ethithon, we sprayed some with herbicide,
[11:25.910 --> 11:27.470]  and that's what's pictured here.
[11:27.470 --> 11:30.110]  And that plant was very stressed.
[11:30.110 --> 11:32.150]  It was pretty nearly dead there.
[11:32.150 --> 11:36.310]  We also infected some plants with powdery mildew, with the idea that maybe cannabinoids
[11:36.310 --> 11:40.030]  are for pathogen resistance, so they'd be upregulated.
[11:40.030 --> 11:46.070]  We also went at them with a weed whacker, and we also flooded a pot as well.
[11:46.070 --> 11:50.410]  So remarkably, nothing increased THC over control.
[11:50.410 --> 11:58.110]  So not only does stress, you know, it's not just that genetics has a large effect, it
[11:58.110 --> 12:01.750]  appears to be the only thing that matters here.
[12:01.750 --> 12:08.670]  So if we look at this total THC, nothing was above our control for total THC, but our herbicide
[12:08.750 --> 12:12.990]  activated plants were considerably below that total THC, and that makes a lot of sense,
[12:12.990 --> 12:15.070]  because those plants were very nearly dead.
[12:15.070 --> 12:18.910]  And as we're fond of saying in the lab, a dead plant produces no cannabinoids.
[12:18.910 --> 12:25.070]  But if we look at that ratio of CBD to THC across all cultivars, across all environments,
[12:25.070 --> 12:29.790]  it's flat across the board, somewhere between 20 and 30.
[12:29.790 --> 12:36.310]  So there's no change in CBD to THC ratio upon any environmental stress that we tried.
[12:36.310 --> 12:40.790]  So an obvious question is, why is this ratio so consistent?
[12:40.790 --> 12:45.870]  And to answer this, we think the answer comes from a paper that was published in 2018 from
[12:45.870 --> 12:52.790]  a group in Germany, where they took the CBD synthase enzyme, that one that makes the CBD,
[12:52.790 --> 12:55.150]  and they expressed it in yeast.
[12:55.150 --> 13:00.490]  And what they found was that for every 100 molecules of CBD that this enzyme produced,
[13:00.490 --> 13:04.430]  it also produced about four molecules of THC.
[13:04.550 --> 13:07.110]  And remarkably, that's exactly what we see in the plants.
[13:07.110 --> 13:10.870]  So we have strong reason to believe that it's just this product promiscuity.
[13:10.870 --> 13:15.870]  It's this one enzyme that's making this THC as well as the CBD.
[13:15.870 --> 13:20.390]  Now what's more, if this model were correct, it makes an interesting prediction in that
[13:20.390 --> 13:27.430]  while this enzyme made 100 molecules of CBD and about four of THC, it also made about
[13:27.430 --> 13:30.950]  six of another cannabinoid called CBC.
[13:30.950 --> 13:36.830]  So we went back to our cannabinoid trials, and lo and behold, that's the ratio that we
[13:36.830 --> 13:41.230]  saw in the vast majority of plants for CBC to CBD.
[13:41.230 --> 13:47.550]  So we have strong evidence that it's product promiscuity of the single enzyme that is causing
[13:47.550 --> 13:52.830]  the vast majority of these cannabinoids in the plant, because the CBD to THC to CBC ratio
[13:52.830 --> 13:56.790]  in most plants matches the enzyme exactly.
[13:56.790 --> 14:00.630]  There are a few outliers in terms of CBC production.
[14:01.310 --> 14:05.150]  Some of them have abnormally high CBC production, and other groups have found dedicated CBC
[14:05.150 --> 14:08.950]  asynthases, but in most of the plants that we've tested, that's not the case.
[14:08.950 --> 14:13.630]  And this cannabinoid profile can be explained by this single enzyme.
[14:13.630 --> 14:17.110]  So with all of this, we have some very concrete advice to growers.
[14:17.110 --> 14:20.430]  We suggest to them to grow chemotype three plants.
[14:20.430 --> 14:24.070]  Don't grow chemotype one and two plants if you want to stay below 0.3, because you won't
[14:24.070 --> 14:25.330]  be able to.
[14:25.330 --> 14:31.930]  And we also suggest them to test the plants early and to not get greedy, because it looks
[14:31.930 --> 14:41.010]  like because that ratio is set at around 7%, it's going to produce 0.3% THC.
[14:41.010 --> 14:48.730]  So if we have to stay under 0.3% THC, we have to stay under 7% CBD.
[14:48.730 --> 14:52.450]  Now as I mentioned earlier, one of the first things I did was create molecular markers.
[14:52.570 --> 14:57.410]  And next up, I'm going to talk about how I applied these in a breeding context.
[14:57.410 --> 15:03.330]  So we've tested a lot of different cultivars, and a lot of cultivars are segregating for
[15:03.330 --> 15:04.330]  this B locus.
[15:04.330 --> 15:10.290]  In fact, I didn't mention it earlier, but in our CBD trial, I had 13 cultivars and 12
[15:10.290 --> 15:13.770]  of them had active THC synthase.
[15:13.770 --> 15:15.450]  They had that BT allele.
[15:15.450 --> 15:20.170]  So we came across a couple of interesting cultivars from China, this one Puma and this
[15:20.170 --> 15:22.130]  other one Han Northwest.
[15:22.810 --> 15:31.530]  And when we applied our molecular markers to these, we saw that there was about a 25%
[15:31.530 --> 15:36.690]  of the plants were chemotype 1, about 25% were chemotype 3, and then about half were
[15:36.690 --> 15:37.970]  chemotype 2.
[15:37.970 --> 15:41.670]  So this is exactly what you'd expect to see for a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
[15:41.670 --> 15:45.970]  with an allele frequency of about 0.25, or sorry, about 0.5.
[15:46.970 --> 15:51.970]  But in any case, what we wanted to do was simply select the chemotype 3 plants out of
[15:51.970 --> 15:56.210]  this, and we can do that with the molecular marker, which is a much easier thing to do
[15:56.210 --> 16:00.250]  than to select based on HPLC analysis.
[16:00.250 --> 16:07.730]  So I have made progress in both of these projects, but unfortunately, due to some varieties in
[16:07.730 --> 16:11.370]  the weather, I don't have much data to present on Puma, but I do have some interesting data
[16:11.370 --> 16:14.210]  on this Han Northwest population.
[16:14.210 --> 16:22.690]  So if we look at the original ratio of the CBD to THC of Han Northwest, it's around 0.7,
[16:22.690 --> 16:23.690]  so it's pretty low.
[16:23.690 --> 16:28.970]  And when you look at that total THC, it's up pretty high, well above that 0.3 threshold.
[16:28.970 --> 16:32.890]  When I selected my plants and then did two further cycles of phenotypic selection based
[16:32.890 --> 16:37.930]  on earliness, we can see that CBD to THC ratio goes well up above 20.
[16:37.930 --> 16:42.650]  And we look at the total THC, which is the number that matters, we're very low at around
[16:42.650 --> 16:44.450]  0.06.
[16:44.450 --> 16:49.730]  So this one round of marker selection was very effective in removing that active THC
[16:49.730 --> 16:54.370]  synthase enzyme and reducing the total THC in the plant.
[16:54.370 --> 16:58.890]  Now, last year we had our first yield trial of this cultivar, and before I get into how
[16:58.890 --> 17:04.650]  well it yielded, I want to talk a little bit about how hemp generally yields.
[17:04.650 --> 17:09.370]  So in 2021, it was the first year that the USDA released estimates on hemp yields and
[17:09.370 --> 17:12.090]  pounds per acre, and it's pretty low.
[17:12.090 --> 17:15.890]  530 is not that great even compared to other specialty crops.
[17:15.890 --> 17:18.570]  And this is largely because of a lack of adapted cultivars.
[17:18.570 --> 17:23.090]  A lot of the grain cultivars were bred in Canada or in Finland, so they're not going
[17:23.090 --> 17:27.610]  to grow all that well in New York, much less in Florida or Texas.
[17:27.610 --> 17:31.930]  So this 530 matches pretty well with our experience.
[17:31.930 --> 17:37.690]  This is 2020 yield data, and we can see that most of the cultivars that we tried were around
[17:37.690 --> 17:40.570]  500 to 1,000 pounds per acre.
[17:40.570 --> 17:45.450]  Our best ever trial cultivar was a little bit above 2,000 pounds per acre, but we haven't
[17:45.450 --> 17:47.450]  really been able to replicate that.
[17:47.450 --> 17:51.550]  And the best hemp yield I've ever seen in the literature, and I haven't really been
[17:51.550 --> 17:57.450]  able to track down exactly how it was done, but they're reporting yields of up to 3,000
[17:57.450 --> 17:58.450]  pounds per acre.
[17:58.450 --> 18:03.250]  So if we could get up to 3,000 pounds per acre regularly, hemp could be a competitor
[18:03.250 --> 18:04.370]  to soybean.
[18:04.370 --> 18:06.570]  So we were really excited.
[18:06.570 --> 18:08.710]  And when I started, that was the big dream.
[18:08.710 --> 18:14.610]  Maybe we can have the next soybean if we can get this 3,000 pounds per acre as a regular
[18:14.610 --> 18:15.610]  thing.
[18:15.610 --> 18:20.170]  So in 2021, we tried this new cultivar, and most of the old cultivars that we tried were
[18:20.170 --> 18:23.330]  again around that 500 to 1,000 range.
[18:23.330 --> 18:32.130]  But this new cultivar here yielded above 4,000 and was in fact pushing 5,000 pounds per acre.
[18:32.130 --> 18:37.330]  So I'm sort of tempted just to stop there and claim that I 10x'd the hemp yield from
[18:37.330 --> 18:39.930]  500 to 5,000.
[18:39.930 --> 18:42.010]  But there are a couple of big caveats there.
[18:42.010 --> 18:47.370]  So first of all, even though I did a couple of rounds of selection for earliness, this
[18:47.370 --> 18:49.050]  plant was still very, very late.
[18:49.050 --> 18:53.570]  We were harvesting around October 15th, and in Ithaca, the last day of frost is usually
[18:53.570 --> 18:55.470]  accepted to be about October 1st.
[18:55.470 --> 19:01.450]  So we don't really want to advise growing plants that are going to mature after frost.
[19:01.450 --> 19:07.810]  The other major thing, which is a big asterisk on this number, is that these plants in the
[19:07.810 --> 19:09.270]  field were giants.
[19:09.270 --> 19:11.290]  They were 10 feet tall easily.
[19:11.290 --> 19:14.270]  And that meant that our regular combine couldn't harvest them.
[19:14.270 --> 19:16.210]  So we had to harvest them by hand.
[19:16.210 --> 19:21.530]  And it's pretty well known and not talked about much that when you harvest a plant by
[19:21.530 --> 19:25.950]  a combine, you end up losing about 30% of the total yield.
[19:25.950 --> 19:28.890]  So these ones here are regular cultivars.
[19:28.890 --> 19:33.210]  They're artificially depressed in that we lost a lot in the combining process that we
[19:33.210 --> 19:37.050]  didn't lose in this new cultivar that we developed.
[19:37.050 --> 19:40.490]  So with all that being said, we think that there are answers to these problems with advancements
[19:40.490 --> 19:46.650]  in machinery and perhaps to deal with the lateness problem growing it at a more southern
[19:46.650 --> 19:47.930]  latitude.
[19:47.930 --> 19:54.570]  And we have collaborated with various people from NC State, from Kentucky, from Florida,
[19:54.650 --> 19:59.570]  and from Arizona who will be trialing this cultivar next year to see what kind of yields
[19:59.570 --> 20:04.090]  they can get off of it and if the plant will remain manageable enough that it can be harvested
[20:04.090 --> 20:06.930]  using conventional means.
[20:06.930 --> 20:13.610]  So I think I've demonstrated that these molecular markers have been very effective in developing
[20:13.610 --> 20:19.650]  new cultivars, but they also led to some interesting scientific advances.
[20:19.650 --> 20:23.510]  So this is the chromatogram that I get when I run my molecular marker.
[20:23.510 --> 20:28.510]  These are chemotype 1 plants, these are chemotype 2 plants, and these are chemotype 3 plants.
[20:28.510 --> 20:30.270]  And this is my water control.
[20:30.270 --> 20:34.470]  So there there's no amplification.
[20:34.470 --> 20:37.290]  And yeah, there's no product present.
[20:37.290 --> 20:40.970]  So when I was running this on a wide variety of different cultivars, one of the cultivars
[20:40.970 --> 20:43.750]  consistently tested with my water control.
[20:43.750 --> 20:46.070]  So there was no amplification going there.
[20:46.070 --> 20:51.390]  And what was remarkable about that is that that cultivar was Sanfica, which is not chemotype
[20:51.390 --> 20:55.270]  1, 2, or 3, but rather chemotype 4, which is CBG dominant.
[20:55.270 --> 20:59.550]  And why that makes a lot of sense, I'll discuss, but we'll have to get into the biochemistry
[20:59.550 --> 21:01.550]  a little bit here.
[21:01.550 --> 21:04.150]  So this is how cannabinoids get synthesized.
[21:04.150 --> 21:08.830]  The first cannabinoid that gets synthesized is CBGA.
[21:08.830 --> 21:17.350]  If CBDA synthase is present, the CBGA gets converted into CBD, and then upon application
[21:17.350 --> 21:21.190]  of heat, it can be decarboxylated into CBD, which is the active compound.
[21:21.190 --> 21:26.550]  When THCA synthase is present, it gets converted into THCA and then THC.
[21:26.550 --> 21:32.950]  And what you can imagine would be some block here that might have been an inactivated CBDA
[21:32.950 --> 21:37.390]  synthase or an inactivated THCA synthase, or maybe it lacks those cannabinoid synthase
[21:37.390 --> 21:39.550]  genes altogether.
[21:39.550 --> 21:43.550]  So with a combination of sequencing, molecular marker work, and looking at breeding histories,
[21:43.550 --> 21:48.270]  we found that there were four distinct routes to CBG dominance.
[21:48.270 --> 21:53.270]  So that Santheca plant that I was showing you earlier, it didn't amplify because it
[21:53.270 --> 21:54.830]  was missing that locus.
[21:54.830 --> 21:58.470]  We also found another one with a missing locus called Panacea, and it has a very distinct
[21:58.470 --> 22:01.690]  breeding history, so we don't think it's the same knockout.
[22:01.690 --> 22:06.670]  We found one type of inactivated CBDA synthase, so it had that gene and it was expressed,
[22:06.670 --> 22:10.510]  but expressed much lower, but it was inactivated.
[22:10.510 --> 22:15.070]  We have an inactivated THCA synthase, which is actually highly expressed, but it doesn't
[22:15.070 --> 22:17.430]  seem to produce THC.
[22:17.430 --> 22:23.030]  And we're currently in the process of ensuring that these are, in fact, completely recessive
[22:23.030 --> 22:28.650]  and developing molecular markers for all of these different routes.
[22:28.650 --> 22:35.750]  So the most common type of CBG plant we saw had this inactivated THCA synthase.
[22:35.750 --> 22:45.710]  And what we did in 2020 was a CBG trial of high CBG plants, and there was a lot of segregation
[22:45.710 --> 22:46.710]  in this trial.
[22:46.710 --> 22:52.010]  So CBG was sort of the new cannabinoid on the block, so everybody was breeding for it
[22:52.010 --> 22:56.190]  very quickly, and they didn't maybe do all that great of a job making sure that their
[22:56.190 --> 22:59.270]  resultant cultivars were uniform, distinct, and stable.
[22:59.270 --> 23:01.910]  So we saw a lot of segregation in the CBG trial.
[23:01.910 --> 23:06.350]  We saw segregation for chemotype, so not all of the plants that were given to us as
[23:06.350 --> 23:09.090]  CBG dominant were, in fact, CBG dominant.
[23:09.090 --> 23:13.910]  We saw some segregation between and within cultivars for powdery mildew resistance.
[23:13.910 --> 23:17.430]  Quite remarkably, we saw some segregation for flowering time.
[23:17.430 --> 23:21.950]  So in a few of the cultivars, we had one quarter of the plants look like this and three quarters
[23:21.950 --> 23:23.670]  of the plants look like that.
[23:23.670 --> 23:27.510]  And if I was growing that, I'd sure hate that, because I put a lot of work into putting that,
[23:27.510 --> 23:31.830]  but as a geneticist, I love it when things happen at one quarter of the time.
[23:31.870 --> 23:35.590]  So before I get on to the work that I've been doing with flowering time, I would like to
[23:35.590 --> 23:38.510]  summarize the work I've been doing with cannabinoids.
[23:38.510 --> 23:43.230]  So we've seen that many cultivars, including high CBD cultivars and grain and fiber cultivars,
[23:43.230 --> 23:48.630]  are segregating for chemotype, and chemotype 3 plants, the ones with that active CBD synthase,
[23:48.630 --> 23:56.470]  will produce 0.3% THC at around 7% or 8% CBD, and we think that that is because of promiscuous
[23:56.470 --> 23:58.790]  activity of the enzyme itself.
[23:58.790 --> 24:02.950]  We found that contrary to popular belief, stress does not have a major impact on cannabinoid
[24:02.950 --> 24:07.790]  profiles, found several different types of CBD dominant plants, and used molecular markers
[24:07.790 --> 24:12.470]  for chemotype to breed new cultivars with very high yields.
[24:12.470 --> 24:16.030]  So getting into flowering time, flowering time is going to be very important for pretty
[24:16.030 --> 24:20.030]  well any major market class of hemp that we are going to grow.
[24:20.030 --> 24:24.350]  The great yield that I saw was because the plant was so late.
[24:24.350 --> 24:28.790]  I showed you earlier in the CBG trials, we had cultivars which were segregating with
[24:28.790 --> 24:32.230]  one quarter for that day neutral, very tiny phenotype.
[24:32.230 --> 24:37.550]  And we've been tracking flowering time in CBD trials for a few years now, and this is
[24:37.550 --> 24:44.030]  a paper published in 2021 with George Stack as a first author, where we saw distinct flowering
[24:44.030 --> 24:46.950]  times within and across different CBD cultivars.
[24:46.950 --> 24:50.950]  So the most obvious difference here is this autoflower phenotype.
[24:50.950 --> 24:56.110]  So autoflowers are the term that's used in the cannabis community to refer to day length
[24:56.110 --> 24:57.110]  neutral plants.
[24:57.110 --> 25:03.110]  They have only a few weeks from seed to flower, so they're not so great when you're planting
[25:03.110 --> 25:06.710]  them out at six feet spacing, but you can imagine some production systems where you
[25:06.710 --> 25:09.830]  have them really close and you can do several cycles a year.
[25:09.830 --> 25:14.310]  It's commonly believed to be a recessive gene, but there's actually been very little published
[25:14.310 --> 25:16.710]  research about this.
[25:16.710 --> 25:21.590]  So we wanted to map this gene and develop molecular markers for this autoflower trade.
[25:21.590 --> 25:24.790]  So to do this, I took two populations.
[25:24.790 --> 25:29.750]  One was in fact one of those CBG populations that I was talking about earlier that was
[25:29.750 --> 25:31.190]  segregating one quarter.
[25:31.190 --> 25:35.710]  And I also made my own F2 population from across between an autoflowering plant and
[25:35.710 --> 25:36.710]  a full season plant.
[25:36.710 --> 25:42.830]  And in both, I saw one quarter of the plants flowering under long days in a greenhouse.
[25:42.950 --> 25:46.990]  So then I used a technique called bulk segregant analysis.
[25:46.990 --> 25:52.070]  So basically what I did was I pulled the DNA from the autoflowering plants and I pulled
[25:52.070 --> 25:54.150]  DNA from the non-autoflowering plants.
[25:54.150 --> 25:59.790]  And then I used a technique called Pi-BSA-seq to figure out where those two groups were
[25:59.790 --> 26:00.910]  different.
[26:00.910 --> 26:05.230]  And what I found was that there was one nice, strong, statistically significant peak on
[26:05.230 --> 26:06.910]  chromosome one.
[26:06.910 --> 26:09.590]  So the autoflower trait is located on chromosome one.
[26:09.630 --> 26:11.870]  And within this peak, there were a few different candidate genes.
[26:11.870 --> 26:16.150]  And I was able to develop molecular markers which could distinguish all of our different
[26:16.150 --> 26:20.830]  autoflowering cultivars as well as our different segregating populations.
[26:20.830 --> 26:27.670]  So to further look at the effect of this autoflower in the heterozygous case, I grew it a population
[26:27.670 --> 26:33.470]  last year in the field and genotyped it with these molecular markers that I developed.
[26:33.470 --> 26:38.150]  So what I found was that it was not in fact fully recessive.
[26:38.190 --> 26:43.030]  I found that the heterozygous case was a little bit earlier than the full season.
[26:43.030 --> 26:46.350]  Here I have it demonstrated as about being two weeks earlier.
[26:46.350 --> 26:50.230]  And the plants were also shorter and had less biomass.
[26:50.230 --> 26:56.950]  And some statistical modeling suggests that it is simply because these plants are earlier
[26:56.950 --> 27:00.870]  that they don't grow as tall and they don't grow as big.
[27:00.870 --> 27:05.550]  So if we look back at this original flowering time data, we see that this one locust model
[27:05.590 --> 27:08.310]  with this autoflower one actually explains most of this variation here.
[27:08.310 --> 27:12.350]  We have our autoflowers, we have our heterozygotes, and we have our full seasons.
[27:12.350 --> 27:19.150]  When we look at these two cultivars here, Umpqua and Deschutes, we can see nice segregation
[27:19.150 --> 27:24.950]  of one to one early to late, which again, I'd hate as a producer, but as a geneticist.
[27:24.950 --> 27:27.230]  What's more, they're marketed as F1s.
[27:27.230 --> 27:29.870]  So this is very likely just a simple back cross.
[27:29.870 --> 27:32.870]  And to give you an idea of what that looks like in the field, both of these were from
[27:32.870 --> 27:33.870]  the same seed lot.
[27:34.030 --> 27:36.870]  And you can see this plant here is nearly ready to harvest.
[27:36.870 --> 27:39.990]  And this one hasn't started flowering at all.
[27:39.990 --> 27:44.790]  So I used a very similar approach to map the difference between these two by bulking the
[27:44.790 --> 27:51.270]  early and the late plants and found that there was a nice peak on chromosome one again, but
[27:51.270 --> 27:55.430]  it was distinct from this autoflower one locust being a little further in.
[27:55.430 --> 27:58.630]  And I've named this locust early one.
[27:58.630 --> 28:04.030]  Looking at the sequencing data, that early group was heterozygous, and I was able to
[28:04.030 --> 28:07.110]  develop high throughput molecular markers, which could distinguish the groups.
[28:07.110 --> 28:14.110]  And I'm currently in the process of testing for epistasis between early one and autoflower
[28:14.110 --> 28:15.110]  one.
[28:15.110 --> 28:20.750]  So if we look back at this data here, we have a two locust model, which is explaining the
[28:20.750 --> 28:22.030]  variation we see.
[28:22.030 --> 28:29.550]  We have our autoflowers, our autoflower heterozygotes with early one heterozygote and lacking that,
[28:29.550 --> 28:30.550]  and we have our full season.
[28:30.550 --> 28:35.030]  So there's still a fair bit of work to do here, especially to see the effects of this
[28:35.030 --> 28:36.790]  early one locust.
[28:36.790 --> 28:40.390]  And hopefully we'll be able to have that in the field this year.
[28:40.390 --> 28:44.550]  We're also very curious about this one cultivar called late sue, which was very, very, very
[28:44.550 --> 28:46.150]  late flowering.
[28:46.150 --> 28:51.190]  And we think that it might have some potential for growth in more southern latitudes such
[28:51.350 --> 28:56.110]  as Florida or even tropical locations such as Thailand.
[28:56.110 --> 29:00.790]  One other thing that I had been working on concerning flowering time was to look at what
[29:00.790 --> 29:04.270]  cultivars would flower under 24 hour light.
[29:04.270 --> 29:07.950]  So you could consider these to be true day neutral in that they will flower even when
[29:07.950 --> 29:09.670]  there's no night at all.
[29:09.670 --> 29:14.550]  So I planted out a wide variety of populations that were distinct taxonomically.
[29:14.550 --> 29:19.870]  I found that the heterozygotes of autoflowers did not flower, which was what we expected.
[29:19.870 --> 29:23.710]  I saw that neither the early nor the late umquas flowered.
[29:23.710 --> 29:28.910]  But one thing that did flower that was a little surprising was some grain varieties from Canada.
[29:28.910 --> 29:32.310]  And when I tested them with my marker, they tested negative.
[29:32.310 --> 29:36.490]  So it's possible that it's the same gene, but my marker doesn't work on these populations.
[29:36.490 --> 29:41.630]  But it's also possible that there is some other gene, some other something going on,
[29:41.630 --> 29:44.870]  which is causing these plants to be able to flower under 24 hour light.
[29:44.870 --> 29:50.750]  And we've done some initial complementation assays to see which hypothesis is correct.
[29:50.750 --> 29:55.550]  And right now we're leaning towards the fact that there may be several different genes
[29:55.550 --> 29:59.790]  conferring photoperiod insensitivity in hemp.
[29:59.790 --> 30:04.950]  So before I get on to my last major segment, I wanted to go over some highlights for flowering
[30:04.950 --> 30:05.950]  time.
[30:05.950 --> 30:11.350]  So I identified two distinct flowering time loci on chromosome one, and I developed high
[30:11.350 --> 30:13.670]  throughput molecular markers for these loci.
[30:13.670 --> 30:18.790]  I found that autoflower one heterozygotes were earlier and smaller than the full season
[30:18.790 --> 30:19.790]  plants.
[30:19.790 --> 30:24.950]  And I posited that there may be several different deneutrality photoperiod insensitivity genes
[30:24.950 --> 30:26.510]  present.
[30:26.510 --> 30:31.790]  But there's still a lot of work to be done to identify and map these genes.
[30:31.790 --> 30:35.550]  So the last thing that I want to talk about is sex determination in cannabis.
[30:35.550 --> 30:37.630]  So as I mentioned earlier, cannabis is mostly dioecious.
[30:37.630 --> 30:40.490]  So there are separate male and female plants.
[30:40.490 --> 30:46.090]  And that's largely determined by an XXXY system.
[30:46.090 --> 30:48.770]  So female plants have two X chromosomes.
[30:48.770 --> 30:52.390]  Male plants have an X and a Y chromosome.
[30:52.390 --> 30:57.650]  And one of the things that I've done is develop a molecular marker that can distinguish between
[30:57.650 --> 30:59.430]  the X and Y chromosome.
[30:59.430 --> 31:01.650]  So we can see here we get two nice groups.
[31:01.650 --> 31:03.370]  These are XY.
[31:03.370 --> 31:05.530]  These are XX.
[31:05.530 --> 31:07.730]  And this is all that we see under normal populations.
[31:07.730 --> 31:10.410]  We don't see any YYs.
[31:11.330 --> 31:19.090]  So despite having a well-defined Y chromosome, sex determination in cannabis is pretty labile.
[31:19.090 --> 31:24.810]  There are a fair number of plants that have two X chromosomes but will produce male flowers.
[31:24.810 --> 31:25.810]  We call these menetious.
[31:25.810 --> 31:33.330]  And they've found a lot of uses in grain and fiber production.
[31:33.330 --> 31:39.530]  We also know that certain chemicals when sprayed on hemp will change the sex of that plant.
[31:39.650 --> 31:45.490]  So for instance, if you spray silver thiosulfate on an XX female plant, it'll produce male flowers.
[31:45.490 --> 31:50.330]  And if you spray ethithon on an XY male plant, it'll produce female flowers.
[31:50.330 --> 31:52.410]  And those female flowers can produce seed.
[31:52.410 --> 32:00.450]  So this STS treatment on XX females to produce male flowers is widely used in the high cannabinoid
[32:00.450 --> 32:07.450]  industry because the pollen resulting from that XX plant is going to be entirely X.
[32:07.570 --> 32:09.730]  So there's no Y chromosome floating around.
[32:09.730 --> 32:13.730]  So at least most of your plants are going to be female.
[32:13.730 --> 32:19.330]  But this ethithon treatment for this XY male to female is less done.
[32:19.330 --> 32:27.810]  And a large part of that is because there's not a huge market for a population that might
[32:27.810 --> 32:30.770]  be majority male.
[32:30.770 --> 32:35.970]  One thing that we were very curious about, though, was if we could create a super male
[32:35.970 --> 32:36.970]  plant.
[32:37.490 --> 32:43.650]  So in theory, if we take our XY plant, which is normally male, and we spray ethithon on
[32:43.650 --> 32:47.770]  it so it gets converted into a female, it'll produce seed.
[32:47.770 --> 32:54.410]  If you cross those, you would expect to see 25% XX female, 50% XY male, and potentially
[32:54.410 --> 33:00.730]  25% YY super male, which is a plant which produces only male offspring.
[33:00.730 --> 33:06.690]  So if you had a YY plant, crossed it with an XX plant, you would get 100% XY plants.
[33:06.690 --> 33:11.330]  And this could potentially be valuable in a fiber cultivar in that male plants tend
[33:11.330 --> 33:14.750]  to flower sooner and produce higher quality fiber.
[33:14.750 --> 33:19.250]  But their existence was still a mystery.
[33:19.250 --> 33:21.330]  So we tried this out.
[33:21.330 --> 33:27.130]  And we found that there were no YY super males observed either in germinated plants or simply
[33:27.130 --> 33:34.010]  in the seeds that we were able to obtain from these XY plants.
[33:34.010 --> 33:38.370]  What's very interesting, though, is that instead of a two-to-one segregation that we
[33:38.370 --> 33:44.650]  might expect if it was simply the case that YYs weren't viable, we saw a one-to-one segregation
[33:44.650 --> 33:46.890]  from male to female in the offspring.
[33:46.890 --> 33:50.410]  So we're still scratching our heads about this a little bit.
[33:50.410 --> 33:53.970]  But what we think might be going on is that there might be some gametophytic selection,
[33:53.970 --> 33:58.250]  maybe something in the case of during egg or ovule development.
[33:58.250 --> 34:03.330]  There might be some expression from the X chromosome, which is required.
[34:03.650 --> 34:11.050]  Ultimately, what we'd really like to do is pollinate an XY female with an XX male.
[34:11.050 --> 34:12.770]  But we haven't done that just yet.
[34:12.770 --> 34:18.450]  But that would provide evidence one way or the other about whether the Y chromosome at
[34:18.450 --> 34:24.290]  the egg stage results in a viable plant.
[34:24.290 --> 34:28.690]  So overall, to briefly summarize everything that I've been talking about so far, concerning
[34:28.690 --> 34:33.850]  cannabinoid synthases, we found that it's the cannabinoid chemotype, not the environment,
[34:33.850 --> 34:36.170]  that causes THC to spike.
[34:36.170 --> 34:41.730]  We've seen that chemotype 3 plants produce about 0.3% THC at around 7% CBD.
[34:41.730 --> 34:46.410]  And we have good reason to believe that that's due to product promiscuity of the CBDA synthase
[34:46.410 --> 34:47.410]  enzyme.
[34:47.410 --> 34:50.930]  We found multiple kinds of CBG dominance.
[34:50.930 --> 34:57.570]  And we used molecular markers based on these chemotypes to breed high-yielding grain and
[34:57.650 --> 34:58.650]  fiber cultivars.
[34:58.650 --> 35:04.370]  Concerning flowering time, I mapped two distinct loci to chromosome 1, and I'm calling them
[35:04.370 --> 35:09.170]  autoflower 1 and early 1, and have posited there are likely additional photoperiod insensitivity
[35:09.170 --> 35:12.610]  genes in cannabis germplasm.
[35:12.610 --> 35:17.010]  In sex determination, I've developed a molecular marker of the Y chromosome and found that
[35:17.010 --> 35:22.730]  YY supermales are unlikely to be viable, and this is potentially a result of gametophytic
[35:22.730 --> 35:23.730]  selection.
[35:24.410 --> 35:27.650]  So before I answer questions, I'd like to make some acknowledgments, especially to other
[35:27.650 --> 35:31.770]  people in Larry Smart's lab, notably George Stack and Craig Carlson.
[35:31.770 --> 35:35.730]  I'd also like to make a special shout out to Mike Quade, who did a lot of the screening
[35:35.730 --> 35:37.290]  work that I was talking about earlier.
[35:37.290 --> 35:40.610]  I'd also like to thank Louise for helping set up the snacks in the back.
[35:40.610 --> 35:45.210]  I'd like to thank Jamie Crawford from the Moore Lab, formerly of the Vyons Lab, who
[35:45.210 --> 35:48.970]  has been a very valuable contact in Ithaca running the yield trials.
[35:48.970 --> 35:53.250]  I'd like to thank Chris Smart and Ali Kalla for their help with pathology, Joss Robe for
[35:53.250 --> 35:57.930]  all of the thousands of HPLC samples that we've gone through, and my committee members
[35:57.930 --> 35:59.850]  for their support.
[35:59.850 --> 36:04.130]  So this work was funded through three sources, including Pixis International and New York
[36:04.130 --> 36:10.730]  State Ag and Markets, as well as a new FFAR hemp research consortium.
[36:10.730 --> 36:16.010]  And before I go to questions, I'd like to make one last thank you to all the companies
[36:16.010 --> 36:20.670]  and individuals who generously provided the seeds which made this work possible.
[36:20.670 --> 36:22.190]  So I'll happily take any questions.
[36:22.190 --> 36:27.950]  I have a lot of questions about the yield.
[36:27.950 --> 36:34.430]  Being a corn guy who likes to defend corn yield and seafloor grasses.
[36:34.430 --> 36:40.790]  So when you're measuring yield on that, is that dry grain and what percent moisture are
[36:40.790 --> 36:42.590]  you at on that?
[36:42.590 --> 36:47.430]  Yeah, so how do we measure grain yield?
[36:47.430 --> 36:51.750]  And this is really Jamie Crawford's wheelhouse, but we do dry them to a standard percentage.
[36:51.750 --> 36:55.550]  And I think the percentage is about 6% moisture, 8% moisture.
[36:55.550 --> 36:56.550]  Yeah.
[36:56.550 --> 37:05.110]  And I guess, you know, in order to, if you were to support four ton per hectare protein
[37:05.110 --> 37:08.990]  coming off, you know, and you have a very high level of protein, right?
[37:08.990 --> 37:09.990]  That's gonna...
[37:09.990 --> 37:12.830]  I have a slide prepared.
[37:12.830 --> 37:17.870]  So this new cultivar here, a couple of things differentiate it from other cultivars.
[37:17.870 --> 37:19.230]  It has very large seeds.
[37:19.230 --> 37:23.590]  It has about a 24,000 seed weight as opposed to the 13 that we normally see.
[37:23.590 --> 37:28.130]  It has a very high oil concentration, but very low protein concentration.
[37:28.130 --> 37:32.710]  And we've actually been doing some work with the food science lab and found that this protein
[37:32.710 --> 37:38.910]  that's being isolated from this plant, while there's less of it on a per seed basis, it
[37:38.910 --> 37:40.630]  appears to be more functional.
[37:40.630 --> 37:44.630]  So we've been looking at the different types of proteins that the plant expresses.
[37:44.630 --> 37:48.070]  There are three main types, adestins, chilans, and albumins.
[37:48.070 --> 37:53.230]  And this cultivar that we've developed here has a very high albumin to adestin ratio.
[37:53.230 --> 37:57.110]  And that leads it to having superior solubility and functional properties.
[37:57.110 --> 38:06.390]  But my issue is at four times per hectare of a high protein without being a nitrogen
[38:06.390 --> 38:09.870]  fixing legume, this is gonna require a heck of a lot of fertilizer.
[38:09.910 --> 38:10.910]  Is that correct?
[38:10.910 --> 38:11.910]  Does it take a lot of fertilizer?
[38:11.910 --> 38:12.910]  Yes.
[38:12.910 --> 38:19.550]  So essentially that may become an action environmental mess.
[38:19.550 --> 38:22.550]  I have another slide.
[38:22.550 --> 38:31.030]  So right now, this has been criminally understudied, but we think that hemp has a lot of potential
[38:31.030 --> 38:37.710]  as an alternate crop.
[38:37.710 --> 38:38.710]  In regenerative agriculture.
[38:39.030 --> 38:41.430]  So there hasn't been much study on this.
[38:41.430 --> 38:47.390]  One interesting study out of Europe found that compared to wheat on hemp, increased
[38:47.390 --> 38:50.670]  wheat yield by 47%, which is quite remarkable.
[38:50.670 --> 38:57.230]  We've heard anecdotal increases of 25% in onion on hemp.
[38:57.230 --> 39:02.710]  This picture here, it wasn't a controlled experiment by any means, and it was much more
[39:02.710 --> 39:04.030]  dramatic in person.
[39:04.030 --> 39:10.590]  But we seeded some sorghum Sudan grass over our hemp fields and just sort of looking at
[39:10.590 --> 39:16.110]  this, we can see that where the hemp was growing, the sorghum Sudan grass had nearly twice the
[39:16.110 --> 39:17.110]  growth rate.
[39:17.110 --> 39:21.430]  So we think that there's a lot of potential for hemp to be used in a system like this.
[39:21.430 --> 39:26.190]  It's also flowers quite late in the season, which might be good for a late season bee
[39:26.190 --> 39:27.190]  food.
[39:27.190 --> 39:34.790]  So whether environmentally, whether it's all that beneficial if we need to apply that
[39:34.790 --> 39:38.870]  nitrogen to get these high protein seeds, that's an interesting concept.
[39:38.870 --> 39:42.030]  And I'd like to talk with you later on that if you're free.
[39:42.030 --> 39:43.030]  Yeah.
[39:43.030 --> 39:47.630]  I mean, I'm concerned that the amount of nitrate release, nitrous oxide release, to sustain
[39:47.630 --> 39:51.310]  that on a non-legume would be massive.
[39:51.470 --> 39:59.310]  Because that's an impressive level of protein, but that's a lot of nitrogen.
[39:59.310 --> 40:00.310]  Yeah.
[40:00.310 --> 40:03.870]  So it's a lot of nitrogen for sure.
[40:03.870 --> 40:06.870]  So we don't know why we're getting better yields after this.
[40:06.870 --> 40:11.550]  It could be something like biological nitrification inhibition, which is leading to more of that
[40:11.550 --> 40:15.990]  nitrogen being retained, but we don't know.
[40:15.990 --> 40:22.070]  So do you think 7% CBD is the limit or do you think there's a way you can further improve
[40:22.070 --> 40:24.310]  that while still staying below the 0.3?
[40:24.310 --> 40:28.510]  So is 7% CBD the limit or is there something we can do around it?
[40:28.510 --> 40:34.470]  So it feels a little dirty doing this, but what you can do legally is you can get your
[40:34.470 --> 40:37.450]  plant tested 30 days before you harvest.
[40:37.450 --> 40:41.270]  So you get it tested at 7%, wait 30 days and harvest it.
[40:41.390 --> 40:49.350]  It's above 0.3, but it doesn't matter because it's not the legally binding number there.
[40:49.350 --> 40:53.130]  We've also seen a little bit of genotypic variation.
[40:53.130 --> 40:56.070]  Some are sort of low 20s for that ratio, some are high 20s.
[40:56.070 --> 41:00.430]  I don't think we've seen anything that's reliably over 30 to 1.
[41:00.430 --> 41:05.670]  But besides testing and growing those cultivars, we've tested a lot of different things that
[41:05.670 --> 41:09.270]  might require some biotechnological innovation.
[41:09.270 --> 41:10.270]  Yeah.
[41:10.270 --> 41:11.270]  Question?
[41:11.270 --> 41:20.710]  Just following up on that, what is the term you use for this where it converts the THC
[41:20.710 --> 41:21.710]  to-
[41:21.710 --> 41:22.710]  Product promiscuity?
[41:22.710 --> 41:23.710]  Yes.
[41:23.710 --> 41:24.710]  What is that like on a protein level?
[41:24.710 --> 41:31.870]  Is that when the protein changes and 3% of the time it just produces something else?
[41:31.870 --> 41:32.870]  Yeah.
[41:32.870 --> 41:37.430]  So the question would be, how does product promiscuity happen?
[41:37.430 --> 41:39.430]  And I wish I knew.
[41:39.430 --> 41:44.710]  I had a lot of plans to go in the lab and figure that out myself, but I was unfortunately
[41:44.710 --> 41:47.770]  not allowed in the lab for a good portion of the past four years.
[41:47.770 --> 41:54.390]  So what probably happens is that you get, it's an abstraction of a hydrogen or something,
[41:54.390 --> 42:00.230]  and then it gets probabilistic about whether it's going to conform one way or the other.
[42:01.230 --> 42:07.190]  the actual, the molecule, the CBGA, it's probably probabilistic whether it goes one way or the
[42:07.190 --> 42:08.190]  other.
[42:08.190 --> 42:11.870]  It's probably what's going on, but more research is going to be required to really figure that
[42:11.870 --> 42:12.870]  out.
[42:12.870 --> 42:19.430]  And going back to the other question, if we could engineer that protein such that it didn't,
[42:19.430 --> 42:22.430]  that would be a very valuable thing, I think.
[42:22.430 --> 42:24.430]  Question in the back?
[42:24.430 --> 42:28.430]  I have a question concerning the chemotype 2 and 3.
[42:28.630 --> 42:34.630]  Because it seems like you still see a very wide range of CBD accumulation, almost like
[42:34.630 --> 42:36.630]  the quantitative increase.
[42:36.630 --> 42:40.630]  Do you know what the genetic regulation for that is?
[42:40.630 --> 42:47.630]  Is it just due to the inactivations in the B locus, or do you think there might be mutations
[42:47.630 --> 42:48.630]  in the promoter regions?
[42:48.630 --> 42:52.630]  Or do you know what on a genetic basis leads to this increase?
[42:52.630 --> 42:55.630]  I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.
[42:55.830 --> 43:04.830]  So that you do see that it's like almost quantitative increase in the CBD for the chemotype 2 and 3?
[43:05.830 --> 43:08.830]  Total cannabinoid accumulation is a quantitative curve.
[43:08.830 --> 43:14.830]  So what's the genetic basis for the quantitative accumulation of total cannabinoids?
[43:14.830 --> 43:24.830]  Yeah, so looking at this here, yeah, cannabinoid synthesis, it's a complex trade about how much
[43:25.030 --> 43:27.030]  cannabinoids will be synthesized.
[43:27.030 --> 43:29.030]  This chemotype system doesn't tell you anything about that.
[43:29.030 --> 43:32.030]  It just tells you what group you're going to be in.
[43:33.030 --> 43:35.030]  Does that answer your question?
[43:35.030 --> 43:43.030]  Do you know what leads to the variation that you see within each chemotype?
[43:44.030 --> 43:46.030]  I mean, there's going to be a lot of different...
[43:46.030 --> 43:50.030]  So what leads to variation within chemotype?
[43:50.230 --> 43:56.230]  So within this group here, the variation, whether a plant's going to be 4% or 12%
[43:56.230 --> 43:59.230]  is going to be dependent on a lot of factors.
[43:59.230 --> 44:04.230]  There's going to be 10, 20, 100 genes, which are all going to contribute a little bit
[44:04.230 --> 44:08.230]  to how much total cannabinoids the plant is going to produce.
[44:08.230 --> 44:11.230]  When we look at this chemotype 2 plants, it gets a little more interesting
[44:11.230 --> 44:14.230]  because we see a lot more spread across here.
[44:14.230 --> 44:18.230]  It's not that 26 to 1 ratio that we see all the time in these other plants.
[44:18.430 --> 44:21.430]  And there's a couple of things which we think are involved there.
[44:21.430 --> 44:25.430]  One of the cases is because this is heterozygous,
[44:25.430 --> 44:31.430]  you can sort of see some variation that's hidden in the homozygous case.
[44:31.430 --> 44:35.430]  So we don't have a lot of data on this and because all of these plants
[44:35.430 --> 44:40.430]  test way above 0.3% THC, we can't do any of that research here.
[44:40.430 --> 44:44.430]  But some THCA synthases are more active than others.
[44:44.630 --> 44:49.630]  So when you're in heterozygous case, you might be here instead of here.
[44:49.630 --> 44:52.630]  But when you're in the homozygous case, you don't see it.
[44:54.630 --> 44:57.630]  Not sure how we figured that out since we can't work on those plants.
[44:57.630 --> 44:58.630]  Ah, yep.
[44:58.630 --> 45:05.630]  Can you talk about how you did your complementation test?
[45:05.630 --> 45:07.630]  Can I talk about the complementation test?
[45:07.630 --> 45:10.630]  Yeah, so I do have a slide for that at the end as well.
[45:10.830 --> 45:13.830]  And unfortunately, it doesn't really give a nice clean story.
[45:13.830 --> 45:19.830]  So I have my Canadian grain variety here, which is piccolo.
[45:19.830 --> 45:22.830]  And I found that it flowered under 24-hour light.
[45:22.830 --> 45:27.830]  I have my autoflower 1 plant here, which flowered under 24-hour light.
[45:27.830 --> 45:31.830]  And I have my F1 plant here, which was a cross between this grain variety
[45:31.830 --> 45:34.830]  and this autoflowering variety.
[45:34.830 --> 45:38.830]  So if there were two different recessive genes involved,
[45:39.030 --> 45:41.030]  you would see complementation between the two.
[45:41.030 --> 45:48.030]  So we would see that full pathway that leads to photoperiod-sensitive flowering occur.
[45:48.030 --> 45:53.030]  But what we see here is that our grain flowers at around 7 weeks,
[45:53.030 --> 45:55.030]  our autoflowers flower at around 4 weeks,
[45:55.030 --> 45:58.030]  and the F1s flower at around 7 weeks.
[45:58.030 --> 46:03.030]  So there might be some dominant thing coming from that grain variety
[46:03.030 --> 46:06.030]  or there might be some interaction between whatever is going on
[46:06.230 --> 46:09.230]  for photoperiod-insensitivity from the grain variety and the autoflower 1.
[46:09.230 --> 46:14.230]  One other interesting note is that we have distinct flowering times
[46:14.230 --> 46:18.230]  for male flowering from piccolo, which is the grain variety,
[46:18.230 --> 46:22.230]  and this F1, with this F1 being quite a bit later in terms of male flowering.
[46:22.230 --> 46:26.230]  So in all, I don't have a clean story, but we're doing more work right now
[46:26.230 --> 46:31.230]  to really figure out what's going on in terms of photoperiod-insensitive flowering.
[46:31.430 --> 46:32.430]  Very cool.
[46:35.430 --> 46:43.430]  So CBD and THCA are both converted to CBD and THC via heat, as you said.
[46:43.430 --> 46:50.430]  Does heat potentially, or can you have a potential effect
[46:50.430 --> 46:53.430]  through the environment through this heat conversion,
[46:53.430 --> 46:58.430]  or does potentially heat have an effect on the promiscuity of the enzyme?
[46:58.630 --> 47:03.630]  So what's the effect of heat, given that it decarboxylates all of these different chemicals?
[47:03.630 --> 47:08.630]  So that's a very interesting question, whether product promiscuity changes in heat.
[47:08.630 --> 47:12.630]  I would just guess, given my biochemistry background, that it might.
[47:12.630 --> 47:16.630]  Maybe there's more motion, maybe that active site gets opened up a little bit,
[47:16.630 --> 47:21.630]  so it changes, but I don't have any hard and fast evidence right there.
[47:21.630 --> 47:24.630]  And we haven't done very many heat trials,
[47:24.830 --> 47:27.830]  partly because they're very difficult to run.
[47:27.830 --> 47:31.830]  You can't really run them outside, and our greenhouse,
[47:31.830 --> 47:34.830]  even that's a very difficult trial to run.
[47:34.830 --> 47:38.830]  So the decarboxylation definitely occurs.
[47:40.830 --> 47:45.830]  So all of the numbers that I've been presenting have been total potential cannabinoids.
[47:45.830 --> 47:50.830]  So that would be the amount of CBD, if I converted all that CBDA to CBD.
[47:51.030 --> 47:55.030]  We've just found that's a much more consistent number
[47:55.030 --> 47:58.030]  than looking either at the acid or at the neutral form.
[47:58.030 --> 48:02.030]  So heat does have effects on cannabinoid profiles,
[48:02.030 --> 48:07.030]  but those are some hard studies to run that we haven't done any work on.
[48:07.030 --> 48:11.030]  One question here, and then maybe we can look at Zoom.
[48:11.030 --> 48:16.030]  So I think when hemp started coming around,
[48:16.230 --> 48:21.230]  there's talk from a lot of farmers that said that the hemp fibers
[48:21.230 --> 48:24.230]  really obscured when they combined,
[48:24.230 --> 48:27.230]  and so some people I know don't touch it.
[48:27.230 --> 48:30.230]  Have there been mechanical advancements to combat that,
[48:30.230 --> 48:33.230]  or maybe genetic selection for that too?
[48:33.230 --> 48:38.230]  Yeah, so has there been mechanical or genetic selection
[48:38.230 --> 48:40.230]  for plants that are easier to combine?
[48:40.230 --> 48:45.230]  Absolutely, and that's one of the big things against the 5,000 pounds per acre,
[48:45.430 --> 48:48.430]  is that the rest of them we can combine,
[48:48.430 --> 48:51.430]  because these plants have been bred to be short,
[48:51.430 --> 48:53.430]  to have a comparatively weaker stem.
[48:53.430 --> 48:55.430]  This is more of a dual-purpose cultivar.
[48:55.430 --> 48:59.430]  It has a strong stem, so you're going to require some heavy machinery
[48:59.430 --> 49:03.430]  to harvest it, but you could potentially get some very high yields.
[49:03.430 --> 49:07.430]  And that being said, there have been advances in machinery as well.
[49:07.430 --> 49:11.430]  Notably, there's a big hemp flax combine,
[49:11.630 --> 49:15.630]  which can harvest the full length of the stem and all of the grain,
[49:15.630 --> 49:17.630]  and depending on how you use it,
[49:17.630 --> 49:21.630]  you can also get a cannabinoid-rich floral section after all that.
[49:21.630 --> 49:25.630]  So advances in both, yes, but to maximize yield,
[49:25.630 --> 49:28.630]  there's going to be some give somewhere.
[49:28.630 --> 49:31.630]  Don't spread those rumors.
[49:31.630 --> 49:34.630]  All you've got to do is cover up the shafts with PVC pipe.
[49:34.630 --> 49:38.630]  The Canadians have been doing it for 15 or 20 years.
[49:41.630 --> 49:44.630]  Any questions on Zoom?
[49:44.630 --> 49:47.630]  Okay, last chance.
[49:47.630 --> 49:52.630]  So you have two alleles, one that has an active THC
[49:52.630 --> 49:54.630]  and one that has an active CBD,
[49:54.630 --> 49:57.630]  and there's no alleles that recombine those?
[49:57.630 --> 50:03.630]  So we have the BD allele and then the BT allele,
[50:03.630 --> 50:06.630]  and they're not the same gene, so do we ever see recombination?
[50:06.630 --> 50:10.630]  And that gets into the nitty-gritty molecular genetic stuff, which is messy.
[50:10.830 --> 50:14.830]  So very largely, we don't see recombination between those two genes.
[50:14.830 --> 50:18.830]  When we look at the gene sequences, it's just kind of a mess.
[50:18.830 --> 50:22.830]  There's a ton of gene duplications, of rearrangements, of inversions,
[50:22.830 --> 50:26.830]  pseudogenes everywhere, cassettes, rectotransposons,
[50:26.830 --> 50:29.830]  like every word that you can think of that makes a thing difficult,
[50:29.830 --> 50:31.830]  you have there.
[50:31.830 --> 50:35.830]  So what we do is we treat it as two distinct loci that don't recombine,
[50:35.830 --> 50:38.830]  and we're right most of the time.
[50:39.030 --> 50:42.030]  Yeah, there have been people who are actively studying
[50:42.030 --> 50:44.030]  to see how much recombination really occurs
[50:44.030 --> 50:48.030]  and really defining the limits of that locus,
[50:48.030 --> 50:55.030]  but by and large, we see that this behaves as essentially one locus.
[50:55.030 --> 50:57.030]  We have not seen it yet.
[51:00.030 --> 51:02.030]  Still looking.
[51:02.030 --> 51:07.990]  Okay.
[51:07.990 --> 51:09.990]  So...
[51:10.190 --> 51:18.150]  So we learned a lot from Jacob today.
[51:18.150 --> 51:20.150]  We thank him for that.
[51:20.150 --> 51:26.150]  We also learned there is hope for a former serial genomicist.
[51:26.150 --> 51:28.150]  So keep that in mind.
[51:28.150 --> 51:36.150]  I forgot to mention that Jacob will be staying on as a postdoc
[51:36.150 --> 51:40.150]  in my lab, running my lab while I go on sabbatical.
[51:40.350 --> 51:45.350]  So he will be around for a while, hopefully quite a while,
[51:45.350 --> 51:49.350]  and again has a lot more work to finish up on.
[51:49.350 --> 51:54.350]  But for now, please join me in thanking Jacob and congratulating him.
[51:54.350 --> 52:07.850]  This has been a production of Cornell University,
[52:07.850 --> 52:11.850]  on the web at cornell.edu.
