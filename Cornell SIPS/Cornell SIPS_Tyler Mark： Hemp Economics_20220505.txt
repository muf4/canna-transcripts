[00:00.120 --> 00:04.120]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.120 --> 00:12.880]  So welcome, everyone.
[00:12.880 --> 00:19.320]  Thank you for joining the final Hemp webinar series.
[00:19.320 --> 00:22.080]  I don't want to speak for you all,
[00:22.080 --> 00:27.880]  but I've had an absolute blast with this seminar series.
[00:27.880 --> 00:30.440]  And I've learned so many different things.
[00:30.440 --> 00:33.240]  And I want to reiterate my gratitude
[00:33.240 --> 00:39.240]  towards our wonderful speakers, George, Tony, Gemma, and Kim,
[00:39.240 --> 00:43.400]  for handling so many logistics associated with this work,
[00:43.400 --> 00:46.680]  our interpreters, et cetera.
[00:46.680 --> 00:48.680]  And last but not least, I want to thank
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.720]  y'all for showing up every week.
[00:51.720 --> 00:55.320]  I hope this has provided some real value.
[00:55.320 --> 00:59.920]  All of these seminars are available on YouTube
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.200]  on the Cornell SIPS, Cornell S-I-P-S, channel.
[01:05.200 --> 01:08.480]  And please view them, review them, share them.
[01:11.360 --> 01:17.360]  So today, I wanted to just briefly reiterate
[01:17.360 --> 01:19.640]  our work at Cornell and the USDA.
[01:19.640 --> 01:22.920]  So we're trying to build the world's largest seed
[01:22.920 --> 01:28.400]  library of genetically and geographically diverse hemp
[01:28.400 --> 01:29.680]  genetic resources.
[01:30.440 --> 01:32.960]  So this can be seeds, clones, et cetera.
[01:32.960 --> 01:38.200]  Our goal is to store them safely, long term,
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.120]  characterize them, collect data, all kinds of data about them,
[01:42.120 --> 01:45.720]  and then share those seeds and the data
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.480]  with many different stakeholders and collaborators.
[01:51.480 --> 01:54.080]  So sometimes people will be trying
[01:54.080 --> 01:56.480]  to breed new varieties of hemp that
[01:56.480 --> 01:59.440]  are adapted to different regions or studying
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.200]  different mechanisms that controls fiber quality in hemp.
[02:04.200 --> 02:09.520]  Those are two of very, two potential applications
[02:09.520 --> 02:11.440]  that our work will enable.
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.960]  So let me stop talking about us and let's get
[02:18.960 --> 02:23.120]  on to the real topic today.
[02:23.120 --> 02:29.400]  So I'm thrilled to introduce to you Dr. Tyler Mark.
[02:30.360 --> 02:32.680]  Tyler's research group is developing
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.480]  a local, regional, national, and internationally known
[02:37.480 --> 02:40.080]  research program that is grounded
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.920]  in an interdisciplinary approach.
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.680]  This approach has yielded 31 research publications,
[02:48.680 --> 02:55.000]  secured over $24 million in extramural funding,
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.840]  and is a key stakeholder in the research
[02:58.840 --> 03:03.240]  back to key stakeholders and is continually
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.720]  building new collaborations within and outside
[03:07.720 --> 03:11.000]  of the University of Kentucky.
[03:11.000 --> 03:19.680]  In 2014, he was recognized as a CFARE AAEA Early Career
[03:19.680 --> 03:22.800]  Professional Leadership Award winner.
[03:22.800 --> 03:26.160]  He was also awarded the Golden Quill Award
[03:26.160 --> 03:29.160]  for the most outstanding article published
[03:29.160 --> 03:33.360]  in the Journal of American Society of Farm Managers
[03:33.360 --> 03:36.680]  and Rural Appraisers.
[03:36.680 --> 03:41.240]  In 2018, one of his master's advisees
[03:41.240 --> 03:47.840]  was awarded the SAEA Outstanding Master's Thesis Award.
[03:47.840 --> 03:49.760]  His current hemp research efforts
[03:49.760 --> 03:53.520]  include the following five metrics,
[03:53.520 --> 03:58.040]  national survey of hemp production costs,
[03:58.040 --> 04:01.040]  evaluation of hemp crop insurance,
[04:01.040 --> 04:04.920]  and best management practice for hemp contracts,
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.360]  alternative pricing method for hemp products,
[04:09.360 --> 04:12.840]  consumer demand for hemp products,
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.320]  life cycle analysis of hemp grain
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.160]  and evaluation of hemp grain for beef production,
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.840]  and estimating the economic impact of hemp production.
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.000]  So he's clearly been very busy and he's extremely knowledgeable.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.880]  I'd like to make two points before he starts.
[04:36.880 --> 04:40.440]  The questions always fill up really fast.
[04:40.440 --> 04:42.400]  So if you want him to answer your question,
[04:42.400 --> 04:45.480]  start putting your answers in the Q&A, not the chat.
[04:45.480 --> 04:49.080]  The Q&A, as soon as you have them,
[04:49.080 --> 04:51.320]  and we'll organize them and try to get to them
[04:51.320 --> 04:53.360]  in a timely manner.
[04:53.360 --> 04:56.640]  Secondly, I love seeing where all of y'all are from.
[04:56.640 --> 05:00.880]  It's so exciting to see people from almost every continent.
[05:00.880 --> 05:04.200]  We haven't had an Antarctica watcher yet,
[05:04.200 --> 05:05.960]  but everywhere else.
[05:05.960 --> 05:12.240]  So without further ado, I bring you Tyler Mark.
[05:12.240 --> 05:12.680]  Excellent.
[05:12.680 --> 05:14.040]  Thanks, Zach, for the opportunity
[05:14.040 --> 05:15.720]  to be here this afternoon.
[05:15.720 --> 05:19.080]  And let me get my screen shared here,
[05:19.080 --> 05:20.680]  and we will get rolling because we're
[05:20.680 --> 05:25.480]  going to cover a whole lot of ground this afternoon,
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.520]  as you can imagine.
[05:27.520 --> 05:29.280]  And as Zach talked a little bit about,
[05:29.280 --> 05:31.800]  the group I work with has been extremely
[05:31.800 --> 05:34.400]  busy over the past several years and since I've
[05:34.400 --> 05:37.720]  been working in this since 2014.
[05:37.720 --> 05:40.760]  So we're going to talk about the economics of hemp production.
[05:40.800 --> 05:43.640]  But before I get started, all this work
[05:43.640 --> 05:45.880]  would not be possible without all my collaborators
[05:45.880 --> 05:50.240]  from across the country and across even
[05:50.240 --> 05:52.520]  some international and across governmental organizations
[05:52.520 --> 05:53.040]  as well.
[05:53.040 --> 05:56.800]  And I've thrown, I think, almost all of them up here.
[05:56.800 --> 05:58.480]  If somebody's on here and I missed you,
[05:58.480 --> 06:02.720]  I apologize because there are a lot of different people
[06:02.720 --> 06:04.480]  I work with on a lot of different projects.
[06:04.480 --> 06:06.520]  And we're going to talk about a lot of those different projects
[06:06.520 --> 06:09.200]  today and some of the results that are really starting
[06:09.200 --> 06:12.280]  to come from a wide range of these projects.
[06:12.280 --> 06:15.520]  So just to give you a little bit of a feel for where we're
[06:15.520 --> 06:17.160]  going today, we're going to touch on policy,
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.160]  we're going to touch on production,
[06:18.160 --> 06:19.680]  we're going to touch on consumption.
[06:19.680 --> 06:22.120]  And then we're going to do maybe look into the crystal ball
[06:22.120 --> 06:25.360]  a little bit and try and look forward as to what's coming.
[06:25.360 --> 06:28.280]  And I kind of browse through the participant list,
[06:28.280 --> 06:30.600]  and there's a number of you that I've spoken to before.
[06:30.600 --> 06:34.080]  And if I haven't ever spoken to you and you have questions,
[06:34.080 --> 06:35.240]  we can't get to them today.
[06:35.240 --> 06:37.160]  Feel free to reach out.
[06:37.200 --> 06:40.680]  And I'm more than happy to try and address those questions
[06:40.680 --> 06:43.080]  the best I can or at least point you in the right direction.
[06:43.080 --> 06:45.800]  So all right, so let's get started.
[06:45.800 --> 06:47.760]  So on the HIP policy front, this is
[06:47.760 --> 06:50.880]  a paper and some pieces that we're working on with the ARS,
[06:50.880 --> 06:53.120]  or not ARS, AMS.
[06:53.120 --> 06:54.840]  Trying to get all my acronyms right today,
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.600]  but unfortunately, that'll probably miss a little bit.
[06:58.600 --> 07:01.240]  But this is a USDA funded project.
[07:01.240 --> 07:04.000]  We've been really looking at HIP policy
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.880]  and as it kind of spans across time.
[07:06.920 --> 07:10.400]  So we had the 2014 Farm Bill and all by the,
[07:10.400 --> 07:13.840]  we had the 2014 Farm Bill that just finally sunsetted
[07:13.840 --> 07:15.760]  on January 1st, 2022 this year.
[07:15.760 --> 07:18.400]  But in the meantime, we had the 2018 Farm Bill
[07:18.400 --> 07:20.920]  along with the final rule and the interim final rule.
[07:20.920 --> 07:21.800]  They were all published.
[07:21.800 --> 07:25.000]  So we had all these different moving components in this.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.480]  So that's really caused a lot of confusion
[07:27.480 --> 07:28.720]  in the policy space.
[07:28.720 --> 07:31.280]  So we've been trying to go back
[07:31.280 --> 07:33.360]  and look at these HIP plans
[07:33.360 --> 07:36.200]  and what they actually say in them, what they mean,
[07:36.200 --> 07:38.640]  what type of verbiage is being used in them.
[07:38.640 --> 07:40.360]  Are they consistent across time?
[07:40.360 --> 07:42.440]  And we would have thought that as we moved
[07:42.440 --> 07:44.720]  from 14 to the 18 Farm Bill,
[07:44.720 --> 07:46.560]  that we would have gotten some more consistency.
[07:46.560 --> 07:48.440]  And we did get a little bit more consistency,
[07:48.440 --> 07:50.800]  but we've still got a real long way to go
[07:50.800 --> 07:55.280]  to have an efficient set of regulations for this industry.
[07:55.280 --> 07:58.760]  So I kind of have down here at the bottom, bottom right,
[07:58.760 --> 08:01.160]  the 23, 24 Farm Bill.
[08:01.160 --> 08:03.160]  And what are we gonna do with that?
[08:03.160 --> 08:04.400]  And what is that gonna look like?
[08:04.440 --> 08:06.880]  So a lot of my group and a lot of individuals
[08:06.880 --> 08:09.000]  within my group are starting to think about
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.160]  what are the types of policies?
[08:10.160 --> 08:13.760]  What do we need to be communicating to regulators,
[08:13.760 --> 08:17.440]  legislators, what types of issues are we seeing
[08:17.440 --> 08:19.560]  on this front from a HIP standpoint
[08:19.560 --> 08:22.640]  that we can help fill in some of those gaps with?
[08:22.640 --> 08:23.920]  So that's really something that's been
[08:23.920 --> 08:26.360]  on the forefront here lately to think about.
[08:26.360 --> 08:27.640]  And we can talk about those maybe
[08:27.640 --> 08:30.600]  in the questions later on.
[08:30.600 --> 08:33.080]  But as we were looking at these,
[08:33.080 --> 08:35.160]  we thought they might become more consistent.
[08:35.160 --> 08:37.640]  However, what we really found,
[08:37.640 --> 08:39.760]  and to some degree is expected,
[08:39.760 --> 08:42.760]  these are really, really driven at defining
[08:42.760 --> 08:45.080]  the difference between hemp and marijuana.
[08:46.280 --> 08:50.680]  So which was needed, but at the same time,
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.360]  also still causes a lot of confusion
[08:52.360 --> 08:55.480]  because if you start to look at a lot of the plans
[08:55.480 --> 08:59.200]  and you start to, we looked at 67 different plans.
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.160]  So now you're gonna tell me,
[09:00.160 --> 09:02.080]  well, they can't be 67 different plans
[09:02.080 --> 09:04.120]  because there's not 67 states.
[09:04.120 --> 09:05.920]  Well, there's not 67 states,
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.920]  but there are 50 states plus tribal governments.
[09:11.600 --> 09:12.880]  So when you start to throw in each one
[09:12.880 --> 09:14.280]  of those individual tribal governments,
[09:14.280 --> 09:16.960]  you start to really expand that number.
[09:16.960 --> 09:19.680]  And so hemp isn't even mentioned in all the plans.
[09:19.680 --> 09:22.360]  It's in terms of the way it's defined.
[09:22.360 --> 09:25.480]  Then you can get examples like licensee and registrant.
[09:25.480 --> 09:26.600]  So they mean the same thing,
[09:26.600 --> 09:28.440]  but they're in two different plans.
[09:28.440 --> 09:29.360]  You can get lot.
[09:29.360 --> 09:31.120]  Lot means one thing in one plan
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.920]  and lot means a different thing in another plan.
[09:32.920 --> 09:36.840]  If you start to read the different plans closely.
[09:36.840 --> 09:38.960]  So we've still got a lot of confusion
[09:38.960 --> 09:42.320]  and this paper should be coming out hopefully pretty soon.
[09:42.320 --> 09:43.600]  We're in the process of getting revised
[09:43.600 --> 09:45.600]  and resubmits done on it.
[09:45.600 --> 09:47.880]  But I think this will help clear up
[09:47.880 --> 09:51.240]  or at least point to some of the additional issues
[09:51.240 --> 09:54.520]  that we need to really think about for the 2014,
[09:54.520 --> 09:58.400]  sorry, the 2023, 2024 farm bill,
[09:58.400 --> 10:00.520]  depend upon when it actually comes out.
[10:01.320 --> 10:03.560]  So this has been one area in terms of policy
[10:03.560 --> 10:04.400]  we've been looking at
[10:04.400 --> 10:06.840]  and I'll talk about some more a little bit later.
[10:06.840 --> 10:09.640]  But I'm gonna dive now into kind of where I got started
[10:09.640 --> 10:12.600]  at in this space and this is on the production side.
[10:12.600 --> 10:14.240]  So one of the pieces that we've been working on
[10:14.240 --> 10:16.920]  with some colleagues in Colorado State
[10:16.920 --> 10:19.480]  is trying to look at the differentiation
[10:19.480 --> 10:21.120]  of what happened to different states
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.560]  as they came into production.
[10:22.560 --> 10:25.320]  So when I start to think about those states that came in
[10:25.320 --> 10:28.880]  in that 2014 time period, the Kentucky's, the Colorado's,
[10:30.880 --> 10:33.960]  Vermont and a few other states in there.
[10:33.960 --> 10:35.400]  So what happened to them?
[10:35.400 --> 10:37.080]  How did they come out and peak?
[10:37.080 --> 10:38.480]  And so this graphic right here,
[10:38.480 --> 10:39.640]  you see that they kind of peaked
[10:39.640 --> 10:42.160]  at around 50,000 acres in 2019.
[10:42.160 --> 10:45.400]  We all know 2019 was kind of the peak of this industry
[10:45.400 --> 10:46.520]  for the time being.
[10:46.520 --> 10:49.160]  I think we'll see many more acres than this over time,
[10:49.160 --> 10:51.400]  but where we currently stand.
[10:51.400 --> 10:52.880]  So they peaked around here
[10:52.880 --> 10:54.600]  and they've been falling pretty quick.
[10:54.600 --> 10:57.720]  That group that came in in 2016, they peaked even higher
[10:57.720 --> 10:59.840]  as interest was really ramping up
[10:59.840 --> 11:03.040]  to that 2019 growing season.
[11:03.040 --> 11:04.320]  Those states that came in later
[11:04.320 --> 11:06.440]  have been kind of a little more flat,
[11:06.440 --> 11:08.760]  but we've been trying to really figure out
[11:08.760 --> 11:11.440]  what has driven some of the adoption
[11:11.440 --> 11:13.520]  and this adoption in these states
[11:13.520 --> 11:17.960]  when we start to think about expansion and contraction
[11:17.960 --> 11:20.560]  of the hemp industry within these states.
[11:20.560 --> 11:22.800]  So this is a lot of interesting work
[11:22.800 --> 11:25.320]  that also will be coming out pretty soon as well.
[11:25.320 --> 11:27.480]  Now, keep in mind, we have not differentiated,
[11:28.240 --> 11:29.440]  especially in these two graphics
[11:29.440 --> 11:32.480]  between floral grain and fiber.
[11:32.480 --> 11:34.560]  So they're all kind of lumped together right now
[11:34.560 --> 11:36.600]  and that's something else we're trying to parse out.
[11:36.600 --> 11:40.800]  However, we don't have a whole lot of grain and fiber acres
[11:40.800 --> 11:43.400]  in the country or as many acres in the country.
[11:44.840 --> 11:47.920]  So starting to think about this
[11:47.920 --> 11:49.880]  and kind of where we're at in the state of Kentucky
[11:49.880 --> 11:52.080]  and kind of the state of the industry.
[11:52.080 --> 11:55.200]  When we start to think about the top 10 hemp states,
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.080]  Montana, Colorado, Kentucky down here,
[11:59.080 --> 12:02.080]  when we look at USDA's
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.240]  National Agricultural Statistics Survey
[12:05.240 --> 12:07.520]  that just came out in February,
[12:07.520 --> 12:10.120]  they said we had about 54,000 planted acres,
[12:10.120 --> 12:11.880]  about 33,000 harvested acres
[12:11.880 --> 12:16.160]  and about $824 million in value.
[12:16.160 --> 12:17.840]  Now, you can start to think about,
[12:17.840 --> 12:19.240]  is that really an accurate number?
[12:19.240 --> 12:20.720]  Is that inaccurate?
[12:20.720 --> 12:22.360]  Is that high or low?
[12:22.360 --> 12:24.360]  What I would tell you is that, yes,
[12:24.400 --> 12:26.280]  there are some differences between what you see
[12:26.280 --> 12:28.240]  in the planted acres for the mass survey
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.720]  versus what you see on FSA and other reporting services.
[12:32.720 --> 12:35.440]  But I would just say, hold on,
[12:35.440 --> 12:38.240]  because we're gonna get better at this.
[12:38.240 --> 12:42.040]  Now in 2022, we have to report to FSA
[12:42.040 --> 12:43.720]  all the hemp acres that are produced.
[12:43.720 --> 12:46.920]  So that's gonna help clean this up, clean this data up.
[12:46.920 --> 12:48.600]  But this was a nice first run
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.040]  at these types of figures and stuff
[12:54.720 --> 12:56.200]  from a national standpoint.
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.280]  And I think we're gonna have a couple other surveys
[12:59.280 --> 13:00.120]  come out.
[13:00.120 --> 13:02.080]  I know specifically myself,
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.840]  we have between myself and Colorado State and AMS,
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.000]  we have a national production cost survey
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.640]  that we're in the process of trying to get out.
[13:11.640 --> 13:13.200]  We were hoping to already have it out.
[13:13.200 --> 13:15.080]  However, the wheels of government
[13:15.080 --> 13:16.360]  sometimes move a little slow.
[13:16.360 --> 13:18.960]  So we're still trying to get that through OMB,
[13:18.960 --> 13:21.080]  but hopefully we'll get that out in 2022
[13:21.080 --> 13:24.400]  and we'll have another really in-depth census look
[13:24.400 --> 13:28.280]  at what all is going on in the US hemp industry.
[13:28.280 --> 13:30.680]  And I think that'll provide us some really nice
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.240]  baseline numbers for as we continue to expand this industry
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.000]  over time, as now we've come from the 2019 time period.
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.880]  Now the industry gets a chance to reset and launch again,
[13:43.880 --> 13:46.680]  probably as we start to see more grain and fiber acres
[13:46.680 --> 13:47.640]  come into play.
[13:48.640 --> 13:50.920]  But I also wanna take a moment and step back here
[13:50.920 --> 13:53.080]  and put this industry in perspective
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.680]  when we start to think about other crops in the country.
[13:56.680 --> 13:59.760]  So, we're talking about 54,000 acres.
[13:59.760 --> 14:01.480]  That puts us at a really, really small,
[14:01.480 --> 14:04.120]  I mean, there's less acres of hemp than there are cucumbers.
[14:04.120 --> 14:06.560]  So keep in mind where that plays at
[14:06.560 --> 14:08.520]  on the national landscape.
[14:08.520 --> 14:10.360]  When we start to think about how this plays
[14:10.360 --> 14:13.360]  in the farm bill and the work we're gonna have to do
[14:13.360 --> 14:16.520]  to get recognized as a larger crop
[14:16.800 --> 14:19.680]  and move out of kind of the specialty crop place.
[14:19.680 --> 14:22.880]  Now the floral side may stay in the specialty crop space,
[14:22.880 --> 14:24.560]  but I think grain and fiber are gonna move out
[14:24.560 --> 14:26.080]  into a more commercial space
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.240]  and can meet with those traditional corn and bean,
[14:30.240 --> 14:33.320]  those types of commodities in that space.
[14:33.320 --> 14:35.040]  But keep in mind, we're a pretty small fish
[14:35.040 --> 14:37.200]  in a big pond right now.
[14:37.200 --> 14:39.320]  So that's really where we're at
[14:39.320 --> 14:40.960]  when I start to think about that.
[14:41.880 --> 14:43.560]  So I'm gonna bring in and talk,
[14:43.560 --> 14:46.400]  compare and contrast a little bit here.
[14:47.280 --> 14:48.120]  Some floral pricing stuff.
[14:48.120 --> 14:49.080]  Now this is from the NAS survey.
[14:49.080 --> 14:51.240]  One thing that we really learned from the NAS survey
[14:51.240 --> 14:54.280]  is we didn't do a very good job of asking the question.
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.000]  So if you look at this from an outdoor perspective,
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.480]  you see the price is down less than $100 a pound.
[15:03.400 --> 15:04.960]  And this is still even high.
[15:04.960 --> 15:08.080]  So really what we picked up here is the smokable price,
[15:08.080 --> 15:10.200]  which is an industry that I don't even think
[15:10.200 --> 15:13.280]  with the NAS survey, we were really trying to pick up.
[15:13.280 --> 15:16.020]  However, it's not shocking that we picked that up, right?
[15:16.640 --> 15:18.020]  Because if you start to think
[15:18.020 --> 15:19.540]  and you go forward in this graphic
[15:19.540 --> 15:22.580]  and you look at the biomass pricing,
[15:22.580 --> 15:25.780]  biomass prices dropped precipitously
[15:25.780 --> 15:29.820]  since that 2019, July, 2019 timeframe.
[15:29.820 --> 15:32.540]  We're down here less in a lot of states,
[15:32.540 --> 15:37.020]  less than 20 cents, 30 cents per point.
[15:37.020 --> 15:41.700]  So producers saw that this wasn't a profitable game anymore
[15:41.700 --> 15:43.540]  to be in this space.
[15:43.540 --> 15:44.380]  So what did they do?
[15:44.380 --> 15:45.900]  They switched to the smokable space.
[15:46.780 --> 15:47.700]  So they picked up a lot of the smokable space
[15:47.700 --> 15:49.700]  so that they could survive.
[15:49.700 --> 15:51.980]  You could also throw in Delta eight,
[15:51.980 --> 15:53.360]  played a role in that.
[15:53.360 --> 15:54.980]  We'll see what happens from a policy
[15:54.980 --> 15:57.820]  and regulatory standpoint of Delta eight going forward
[15:57.820 --> 16:00.700]  as to if that continues to be a viable option
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.920]  for producers moving forward after the 23, 24 farm bill.
[16:07.420 --> 16:09.860]  So this is something that's really happened
[16:09.860 --> 16:13.000]  in the industry, but here's that smokable price.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.220]  If you wanted to look at the smokable price,
[16:15.620 --> 16:20.340]  this is really more indicative of what NASS picked up
[16:20.340 --> 16:22.940]  in their survey, which I think is interesting.
[16:23.900 --> 16:26.480]  And it also helps us to think about
[16:26.480 --> 16:29.540]  this next national survey of making sure
[16:29.540 --> 16:33.740]  that we differentiate between floral or biomass price
[16:33.740 --> 16:36.980]  and the smokable price in the industry
[16:36.980 --> 16:40.160]  so that we're comparing apples and apples
[16:40.160 --> 16:43.020]  really with our production cost surveys.
[16:43.020 --> 16:45.700]  But smokable price has been kind of holding on.
[16:45.700 --> 16:50.700]  I am using Panax Exchange as a source of pricing right now
[16:50.740 --> 16:52.540]  for some of this.
[16:52.540 --> 16:55.340]  Most of you probably know there's no open source
[16:55.340 --> 16:56.180]  to do that with.
[16:56.180 --> 16:59.340]  So that's something to think about as well.
[17:00.980 --> 17:03.780]  Also brought this down and put this in a floral pricing
[17:03.780 --> 17:05.700]  because I think it's also really interesting
[17:05.700 --> 17:08.080]  to look at this across states.
[17:08.080 --> 17:11.700]  So the midpoint, you'll see Oregon kind of dropped out here.
[17:11.700 --> 17:13.060]  Oregon's got a really low price.
[17:13.060 --> 17:14.620]  They've had some really big issues out there
[17:14.620 --> 17:16.460]  that they've been trying to deal with.
[17:16.460 --> 17:18.980]  But if you look at Colorado, Kentucky,
[17:18.980 --> 17:20.500]  Northeast Great Plains,
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.260]  they're all kind of pretty similar right here,
[17:22.260 --> 17:27.260]  right around this 20, 27, 28 cents per point type period
[17:29.220 --> 17:30.060]  for a midpoint.
[17:30.060 --> 17:33.340]  The high side, the high side's probably the newer material.
[17:33.340 --> 17:35.460]  This low side will be all the old materials.
[17:35.460 --> 17:38.340]  So remember we had that surplus of material on the market
[17:38.340 --> 17:40.940]  from 2019 and 2020.
[17:40.940 --> 17:42.740]  So we're still trying to get that off the market.
[17:42.740 --> 17:45.460]  Hopefully we've worked through most of that
[17:45.460 --> 17:49.640]  when I was out at the NOCO for that meeting.
[17:49.640 --> 17:53.720]  They talked about moving supplies of biomass storage
[17:53.720 --> 17:55.300]  from about 2 million last year
[17:55.300 --> 17:57.740]  down to about 50 million this year.
[17:57.740 --> 18:00.660]  Hopefully, well, my bigger question
[18:00.660 --> 18:03.260]  on the 50 million pounds is still left in surplus
[18:03.260 --> 18:06.380]  is what type of, is that in a crude?
[18:06.380 --> 18:08.540]  Is that in floral material still?
[18:08.540 --> 18:11.700]  How has that been stored and is it actually still valuable?
[18:11.700 --> 18:12.860]  There are some companies out there
[18:12.860 --> 18:15.580]  that are trying to buy up as much as that as possible
[18:15.580 --> 18:19.300]  because you're starting to see that amount left,
[18:19.300 --> 18:21.580]  that 50 million pounds is not a whole lot.
[18:21.580 --> 18:24.060]  So left on the market.
[18:24.060 --> 18:26.500]  So companies are trying to buy that up
[18:26.500 --> 18:28.180]  before prices start to, I think,
[18:28.180 --> 18:31.380]  trend back up in 2022 and 2023
[18:31.380 --> 18:33.260]  as we see some areas in the country
[18:33.580 --> 18:38.340]  where biomass supplies is in pretty short supply
[18:39.620 --> 18:40.540]  on that side of the coin.
[18:40.540 --> 18:43.980]  So that's a bright spot that I'm kind of seeing as well.
[18:43.980 --> 18:46.180]  But I wanted to pull this back,
[18:46.180 --> 18:48.340]  just the economic basics of this.
[18:48.340 --> 18:51.700]  So CBD, it's really a struggle right now
[18:51.700 --> 18:53.100]  when you start to look at this
[18:53.100 --> 18:55.700]  and you may or may not agree with the pricing components
[18:55.700 --> 18:58.900]  and the percentage, CBD percentage I put in here
[18:58.900 --> 19:00.780]  and I'll talk about that here in a second
[19:00.780 --> 19:03.220]  because you'll see the 39 cents per point,
[19:04.060 --> 19:05.140]  it's kind of on the upper end or the high end
[19:05.140 --> 19:08.100]  of what we're seeing in the market right now.
[19:08.100 --> 19:09.380]  Seven and a half percent,
[19:09.380 --> 19:12.940]  if you talk to the geneticists and those components
[19:12.940 --> 19:14.940]  and especially now with the rules and regs in place
[19:14.940 --> 19:16.540]  where we have a 30 day window.
[19:17.620 --> 19:18.980]  So once you harvest that,
[19:18.980 --> 19:21.100]  if you are sorry, once you test that,
[19:21.100 --> 19:22.500]  if it's less than 0.3
[19:22.500 --> 19:24.500]  and you get that additional 30 days of growth,
[19:24.500 --> 19:26.900]  then you can spike up above this seven and a half percent,
[19:26.900 --> 19:30.180]  but this is run on about a 25 to one type ratio.
[19:30.220 --> 19:32.980]  And I'm guessing several of the geneticists
[19:32.980 --> 19:35.140]  prior to my talk talked about that
[19:35.140 --> 19:36.420]  on some of the assumptions there.
[19:36.420 --> 19:39.100]  But if you look at the bare ground model,
[19:39.100 --> 19:41.020]  it's not very profitable right now.
[19:42.580 --> 19:43.740]  The plastic culture model,
[19:43.740 --> 19:46.180]  which is a much higher cost of production,
[19:46.180 --> 19:47.580]  is definitely not profitable.
[19:47.580 --> 19:50.300]  Now I will say this is for my base scenario,
[19:50.300 --> 19:52.700]  what I will, and you will find producers
[19:52.700 --> 19:56.700]  throughout the country who have some other contracts
[19:56.700 --> 19:58.180]  in place that may pay higher than that.
[19:58.180 --> 20:00.780]  They may have a higher CBD percentage
[20:00.780 --> 20:02.300]  and may have a different cost structure
[20:02.300 --> 20:03.420]  than what I'm looking at.
[20:03.420 --> 20:06.100]  So what I would tell you is if you're getting into this
[20:06.100 --> 20:07.340]  and you wanna go look at it,
[20:07.340 --> 20:09.940]  go to the University of Kentucky Industrial Hemp page
[20:09.940 --> 20:11.820]  and you can find this budget
[20:11.820 --> 20:15.740]  and you can modify it however you would like to modify it
[20:15.740 --> 20:19.180]  to look at your individual scenario that you have in there.
[20:19.180 --> 20:22.220]  So that's something you can definitely go do.
[20:22.220 --> 20:23.540]  So kind of moving forward,
[20:24.420 --> 20:25.900]  when I start to look at the fiber price
[20:25.900 --> 20:28.060]  and I only pulled the fiber price in for the NAS survey
[20:28.940 --> 20:30.180]  because I wanted to point out a couple of different things.
[20:30.180 --> 20:32.420]  So I'm really trying to figure out what's going on
[20:32.420 --> 20:34.260]  in North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
[20:34.260 --> 20:35.460]  and a few of these other states,
[20:35.460 --> 20:39.900]  while they have such a higher price
[20:39.900 --> 20:41.340]  than what I would have expected.
[20:41.340 --> 20:44.020]  I mean, even the 15, 14, 17 cents
[20:44.020 --> 20:45.340]  that you're seeing down here is I think
[20:45.340 --> 20:47.700]  kind of on the upper end of the spectrum
[20:47.700 --> 20:49.380]  of what a lot of fiber processors
[20:49.380 --> 20:53.740]  are gonna be able to pay per pound to make a profit,
[20:53.740 --> 20:55.300]  especially right now with the products
[20:55.300 --> 20:56.860]  and stuff that we're kind of looking at.
[20:56.860 --> 20:58.060]  And I'll touch on that a minute,
[20:58.060 --> 20:59.860]  and a little bit more here in a minute.
[20:59.860 --> 21:01.340]  One idea might be that they're trying
[21:01.340 --> 21:04.100]  to dual or triple crop this.
[21:04.100 --> 21:06.460]  So that may be where they're getting this higher price,
[21:06.460 --> 21:09.100]  but that's definitely another red flag
[21:09.100 --> 21:11.540]  that we need to think about when we come back out
[21:11.540 --> 21:13.260]  with additional surveys in this space
[21:13.260 --> 21:16.420]  so that we don't get some convoluted numbers like this
[21:16.420 --> 21:18.700]  that are really, really difficult to explain
[21:19.660 --> 21:22.420]  and they don't match up to what we're kind of seeing
[21:23.380 --> 21:27.620]  from a group like Panax Exchange who's reporting this.
[21:27.620 --> 21:31.260]  So this right here, this gray line, this would be hemp.
[21:31.260 --> 21:33.580]  This is fiber material.
[21:33.580 --> 21:36.540]  I will tell you, this is an extremely thin market
[21:37.980 --> 21:39.620]  to get pricing information from.
[21:39.620 --> 21:43.260]  So keep in mind that that is a bit of a struggle,
[21:43.260 --> 21:45.140]  but they've been right around that 10 cents,
[21:45.140 --> 21:49.580]  11, eight, nine cents, maybe up to 11 cents a pound.
[21:49.780 --> 21:54.780]  And that's gonna be over here on this axis over here.
[21:54.780 --> 21:57.500]  What will also be on this axis is this right here,
[21:57.500 --> 22:00.460]  which is the conventional grain side of things.
[22:00.460 --> 22:01.420]  It's been pretty flat.
[22:01.420 --> 22:03.220]  It's been going up in price.
[22:03.220 --> 22:05.740]  And I expect to continue to see this
[22:05.740 --> 22:08.660]  kind of have an upward trend in price potentially,
[22:08.660 --> 22:10.460]  especially if it's going to compete
[22:10.460 --> 22:11.900]  with our traditional commodities
[22:11.900 --> 22:14.260]  and buy acres away from those traditional commodities,
[22:14.260 --> 22:15.940]  because for the industry to grow,
[22:15.940 --> 22:19.380]  it's going to have to find products and end markets
[22:20.140 --> 22:21.860]  that produce a profit high enough for those producers
[22:21.860 --> 22:25.060]  to switch acres out of those traditional commodities
[22:25.060 --> 22:27.980]  into hemp production.
[22:27.980 --> 22:30.820]  So that's definitely something to think about.
[22:30.820 --> 22:33.220]  This brighter blue line is gonna be over here
[22:33.220 --> 22:34.620]  on your right-hand side axis,
[22:34.620 --> 22:38.220]  and this is gonna be organic grain specifically.
[22:38.220 --> 22:40.500]  So it's got a little bit higher pricing component,
[22:40.500 --> 22:42.500]  which you would expect,
[22:43.420 --> 22:45.420]  but we're still seeing a lot of struggles
[22:45.420 --> 22:48.660]  in the grain space to really get production in place.
[22:48.820 --> 22:51.180]  But I think this is something that's gonna come in time.
[22:51.180 --> 22:53.500]  I mean, we're still trying to take a lot of Canadian
[22:53.500 --> 22:56.100]  genetics and genetics of Northern latitudes
[22:56.100 --> 23:01.100]  and bring those down to an area where we can grow grain,
[23:01.820 --> 23:03.220]  where we're trying to grow grain.
[23:03.220 --> 23:04.260]  And we don't have any chemicals
[23:04.260 --> 23:06.060]  or anything like that in place yet either.
[23:06.060 --> 23:09.100]  So, but that's a double-edged sword, right?
[23:09.100 --> 23:11.820]  Because many chemical companies,
[23:11.820 --> 23:13.260]  many of your traditional companies
[23:13.260 --> 23:15.780]  are not going to get into this game
[23:15.780 --> 23:17.580]  until they have a minimum number of acres.
[23:17.580 --> 23:19.860]  And we already saw that we're a pretty small fish
[23:19.860 --> 23:21.060]  on a very big pond.
[23:21.060 --> 23:25.940]  So them committing R&D to chemicals for hemp specifically
[23:25.940 --> 23:29.140]  is gonna take some time yet still to get to that point.
[23:29.140 --> 23:32.220]  But I am really excited about what Zach and them are doing
[23:32.220 --> 23:35.540]  at ARS and collecting the genetics and the genetic material.
[23:35.540 --> 23:36.860]  And I'm really looking forward to seeing
[23:36.860 --> 23:39.380]  how that continues to develop
[23:39.380 --> 23:42.260]  and help to bring cost of production down
[23:42.260 --> 23:46.780]  and increase the yields to make this crop more competitive
[23:46.780 --> 23:48.820]  with the other commodities on the market.
[23:51.790 --> 23:52.950]  When I start to think about this
[23:52.950 --> 23:55.270]  from a grain and fiber standpoint,
[23:55.270 --> 23:58.830]  and I think the industry is really starting to reset itself
[23:58.830 --> 24:00.430]  and grain and fiber are starting to find
[24:00.430 --> 24:04.350]  a little bit of traction in the market.
[24:04.350 --> 24:06.270]  I think I'm probably still a little high here.
[24:06.270 --> 24:11.150]  This is not a level that you would see in some states.
[24:11.150 --> 24:13.270]  Now there are some states in the Northern part of the US
[24:13.270 --> 24:15.030]  that are seeing this 1200 pounds.
[24:15.990 --> 24:19.230]  Pricing's probably still a little low,
[24:19.230 --> 24:21.590]  but I am starting to see some positivity
[24:21.590 --> 24:24.430]  on the grain and fiber side.
[24:25.430 --> 24:27.390]  And I think there's gonna be a lot of potential
[24:27.390 --> 24:32.150]  in this space to think about how we get these numbers
[24:32.150 --> 24:33.350]  to go even higher.
[24:33.350 --> 24:34.870]  And I think to get these numbers higher,
[24:34.870 --> 24:37.150]  and we'll talk a little bit about market potential
[24:37.150 --> 24:39.550]  going forward a little bit later,
[24:39.550 --> 24:43.030]  but trying to push up the yield numbers
[24:43.030 --> 24:44.750]  and also trying to push up the price numbers
[24:45.470 --> 24:49.230]  as we seek markets that have high value.
[24:49.230 --> 24:50.950]  So when I think of high value products,
[24:50.950 --> 24:53.030]  especially in the fiber space,
[24:53.030 --> 24:54.470]  in general, I'm not speaking
[24:54.470 --> 24:56.190]  or thinking about the textile industry.
[24:56.190 --> 24:58.550]  I'm thinking about activated carbons.
[24:58.550 --> 25:00.470]  I'm thinking about bioplastics.
[25:00.470 --> 25:02.230]  I'm thinking about those types of products,
[25:02.230 --> 25:06.190]  potentially biofuels, depending upon how you're doing that
[25:06.190 --> 25:09.030]  and which type of fuel you're going after.
[25:09.030 --> 25:12.950]  So I'm trying to think about how we get to a higher price
[25:12.950 --> 25:14.710]  as well as we get these yields up,
[25:16.030 --> 25:18.350]  going forward for this side of the coin.
[25:18.350 --> 25:19.590]  We'll say on the production side,
[25:19.590 --> 25:21.310]  there's a whole lot more things coming.
[25:21.310 --> 25:23.350]  And I'll foreshadow a couple of different things
[25:23.350 --> 25:24.750]  that we're really working on here
[25:24.750 --> 25:25.830]  at the University of Kentucky.
[25:25.830 --> 25:28.110]  And these are projects that are about ready
[25:28.110 --> 25:31.950]  to have some manuscripts released
[25:31.950 --> 25:33.870]  and hit more of the mainstream.
[25:33.870 --> 25:35.990]  But been doing a lot of work
[25:35.990 --> 25:37.670]  with looking at processors labs,
[25:37.670 --> 25:40.950]  where they're at in relation to where the hemp acres are at
[25:40.990 --> 25:45.230]  and starting to think about how we coordinate those two,
[25:45.230 --> 25:50.230]  specifically on the floral side,
[25:50.790 --> 25:53.230]  you're definitely probably gonna see a lot of production
[25:53.230 --> 25:56.150]  close to these labs and stuff because of the cost,
[25:56.150 --> 25:58.830]  or sorry, you would see that on the grain and fiber side
[25:58.830 --> 26:00.470]  because those products are very difficult
[26:00.470 --> 26:02.310]  to move long distances.
[26:02.310 --> 26:05.350]  So you would think about wanting to have a processor
[26:05.350 --> 26:09.590]  and have those acres pretty close to that.
[26:09.590 --> 26:11.390]  The labs, we're still trying to figure out
[26:11.390 --> 26:14.350]  if there's enough lab capacity to handle this
[26:14.350 --> 26:18.590]  in a timely fashion to be able to make this market go forward.
[26:18.590 --> 26:20.070]  We've also put together
[26:20.070 --> 26:22.270]  a set of hemp production contract checklists.
[26:22.270 --> 26:24.470]  So those of you who are thinking about
[26:24.470 --> 26:26.430]  putting together a contract or those producers
[26:26.430 --> 26:29.150]  who are thinking about entering into a contract,
[26:29.150 --> 26:32.630]  we're about ready to release our contract checklist.
[26:32.630 --> 26:35.830]  And that's a project with the University of Maryland
[26:35.830 --> 26:36.750]  that we're working on.
[26:36.750 --> 26:39.110]  So that's definitely something
[26:39.110 --> 26:42.790]  that is coming along fairly well
[26:42.790 --> 26:45.830]  and should give people a really good insight
[26:45.830 --> 26:49.070]  into what they need to make sure to have in that contract.
[26:50.110 --> 26:52.270]  Another piece that we're working on with Colorado State
[26:52.270 --> 26:54.390]  is really looking at the market channels
[26:54.390 --> 26:57.630]  and the factors that affect the market channels.
[26:57.630 --> 27:02.630]  So when we start looking at these producers
[27:03.190 --> 27:04.350]  across the country,
[27:04.350 --> 27:06.630]  how many different market channels are they going into?
[27:07.470 --> 27:09.590]  What is their preferred market channel?
[27:09.590 --> 27:11.230]  What do the different market channels do
[27:11.230 --> 27:12.510]  to their cost structure?
[27:13.990 --> 27:17.230]  What type of expertise do they need to have
[27:17.230 --> 27:18.630]  to get into those marketplaces?
[27:18.630 --> 27:20.630]  So this is a really cool piece
[27:20.630 --> 27:21.950]  that we're about ready to release as well.
[27:21.950 --> 27:24.110]  And we've done, it's a small survey right now.
[27:24.110 --> 27:27.230]  It's of about 30 producers in the state of Kentucky
[27:27.230 --> 27:31.350]  and also in the state of Colorado.
[27:31.350 --> 27:33.070]  So granted it is a small sample,
[27:33.070 --> 27:35.270]  but it really gives a nice insight
[27:35.270 --> 27:37.670]  into the number of different marketing channels
[27:37.670 --> 27:39.110]  that some of these producers are using.
[27:39.110 --> 27:40.870]  And some of these producers are using upwards
[27:40.870 --> 27:43.510]  of six and seven different marketing channels.
[27:43.510 --> 27:45.950]  So can you imagine the time it takes
[27:45.950 --> 27:49.350]  to manage that many different market channels
[27:49.350 --> 27:50.950]  for that producer?
[27:50.950 --> 27:53.990]  So that's a really interesting piece.
[27:54.870 --> 27:57.750]  So I'm gonna jump forward and now,
[27:57.750 --> 28:00.750]  the other hat I get to wear now is on the consumption side.
[28:01.670 --> 28:03.390]  So I would say that the first thing
[28:03.790 --> 28:08.670]  that we really run into that I see is a big hurdle
[28:08.670 --> 28:11.390]  for the industry to get over is really
[28:11.390 --> 28:13.710]  how do people associate this crop?
[28:13.710 --> 28:16.310]  So when we start to ask, and this is out of a survey
[28:17.310 --> 28:19.950]  that we've been running since February of 2021,
[28:19.950 --> 28:21.430]  that runs monthly.
[28:21.430 --> 28:24.350]  If you'd like to talk to us more about that,
[28:24.350 --> 28:27.630]  I'd love to have some further discussions with people
[28:27.630 --> 28:29.470]  about what we have in this survey.
[28:29.470 --> 28:32.150]  But a lot of this survey has to deal with
[28:32.470 --> 28:33.870]  what are the first things that come to mind
[28:33.870 --> 28:35.510]  when you start to think about hemp and CBD
[28:35.510 --> 28:38.230]  and what you're gonna see is marijuana, weed,
[28:38.230 --> 28:41.190]  are two of the first ones, cannabis, another big one
[28:41.190 --> 28:43.030]  that all come to the forefront.
[28:43.030 --> 28:45.910]  Well, that really makes me think about
[28:45.910 --> 28:48.390]  from an economic standpoint,
[28:48.390 --> 28:51.270]  are we gonna be able to get a segment of the population
[28:51.270 --> 28:54.910]  that doesn't want to deal with marijuana
[28:54.910 --> 28:56.590]  or anything associated with marijuana?
[28:56.590 --> 28:59.190]  Are we ever gonna get them to be consumers
[28:59.190 --> 29:00.470]  of these hemp products?
[29:00.510 --> 29:02.870]  And also it tells me that we as a hemp industry
[29:02.870 --> 29:06.830]  have not told our story well enough
[29:06.830 --> 29:09.790]  or educated consumers well enough
[29:09.790 --> 29:12.350]  to know the difference between hemp and marijuana.
[29:12.350 --> 29:14.710]  And if we're truly gonna get this hemp industry
[29:14.710 --> 29:17.590]  to move forward, we've got to be able to differentiate
[29:17.590 --> 29:19.350]  the two and understand the differences
[29:19.350 --> 29:21.030]  and communicate those differences
[29:22.390 --> 29:25.550]  between the two different crops going forward
[29:25.550 --> 29:28.270]  if this industry is truly gonna develop
[29:28.270 --> 29:30.590]  and meet its true potential of what,
[29:31.470 --> 29:32.830]  meet the potential that I think
[29:32.830 --> 29:34.510]  it probably has the ability to do.
[29:37.830 --> 29:39.110]  This is some exciting news
[29:39.110 --> 29:40.870]  that I'm seeing coming out of this survey.
[29:40.870 --> 29:42.750]  So we're looking at nine consumers
[29:42.750 --> 29:45.390]  and likely to try CBD in the next month.
[29:45.390 --> 29:49.910]  So for 2021, you pulled August, September, and October,
[29:49.910 --> 29:51.470]  there's a lot of those nine consumers.
[29:51.470 --> 29:54.070]  This is a sample of about a thousand national,
[29:54.070 --> 29:57.550]  it's a national sample, national representative sample
[29:57.550 --> 29:59.910]  and about 46% of those nine consumers
[29:59.910 --> 30:01.870]  are saying that they're willing to try
[30:01.870 --> 30:03.830]  or going to try CBD in the next month.
[30:03.830 --> 30:06.670]  So that tells me that there's still a lot of interest
[30:06.670 --> 30:07.910]  out there in this crop
[30:07.910 --> 30:09.990]  and interest in consuming these products.
[30:09.990 --> 30:12.190]  I will say that this survey is probably right now
[30:12.190 --> 30:14.630]  really driven more at the CBD side.
[30:14.630 --> 30:17.350]  We are getting into some of the other components,
[30:17.350 --> 30:20.750]  like we've got some stuff coming up on infused beverages,
[30:20.750 --> 30:25.750]  pet foods, and a few other ideas as well
[30:26.510 --> 30:29.190]  that are percolating around this survey.
[30:30.350 --> 30:31.190]  What I will tell you,
[30:31.190 --> 30:33.790]  if you're considering getting into this
[30:33.790 --> 30:36.070]  as a processor or a manufacturer,
[30:36.070 --> 30:39.030]  some of the things that consumers are really thinking about
[30:39.910 --> 30:41.870]  is price is really important,
[30:41.870 --> 30:44.630]  amount of CBD and that dosage is really important.
[30:44.630 --> 30:46.590]  Those tend to be the two big ones.
[30:46.590 --> 30:49.430]  The other big one is our CBD per serving.
[30:49.430 --> 30:51.430]  So those are the things that they're really worried about.
[30:51.430 --> 30:53.030]  Medical recommendation, not as much,
[30:53.030 --> 30:55.630]  but I think, depend upon what FDA does
[30:56.510 --> 30:57.430]  and the direction that they go,
[30:57.430 --> 31:00.630]  will also drive a lot of this information
[31:00.630 --> 31:04.350]  once we get back the human trial results
[31:04.350 --> 31:06.710]  that are out there to start to think about.
[31:08.430 --> 31:11.350]  One other place that we're really working on
[31:11.350 --> 31:14.550]  with the University of Vermont and also Colorado State,
[31:14.550 --> 31:17.350]  when we start to look at the hemp grain side of things,
[31:18.590 --> 31:20.670]  we're doing a lot of surveys on one side
[31:20.670 --> 31:23.470]  to ask people what they want, what they like,
[31:23.470 --> 31:25.070]  what they think they wanna consume,
[31:25.510 --> 31:27.830]  but now we're trying to validate that on the other side
[31:27.830 --> 31:30.670]  and look at the scanner data and what types of trends
[31:30.670 --> 31:33.910]  are we seeing in the actual sales food side of things.
[31:33.910 --> 31:37.110]  So this next couple of slides really digs down more,
[31:37.110 --> 31:40.150]  a little bit more into the grain side of the coin
[31:40.150 --> 31:43.030]  and really grain as an ingredient in hemp food.
[31:44.710 --> 31:47.310]  So this is a scanner data, as I mentioned,
[31:47.310 --> 31:50.630]  granted it only goes up to 2019, we've just got 2020 data,
[31:51.630 --> 31:55.630]  but we have not gotten it added yet to this chart.
[31:55.630 --> 31:57.790]  But what you see is in 17, that kind of peaked
[31:57.790 --> 31:59.910]  and it's been trending down a little bit.
[32:00.990 --> 32:03.670]  I think that the 2020 data will probably start
[32:03.670 --> 32:06.190]  to trend back up, at least from the early numbers
[32:06.190 --> 32:07.190]  that I've kind of seen.
[32:07.190 --> 32:08.710]  I don't know how much yet,
[32:08.710 --> 32:10.750]  because we haven't got that graphic
[32:10.750 --> 32:12.350]  completely pulled back together,
[32:13.470 --> 32:17.150]  and this is total sales for hemp ingredients
[32:17.150 --> 32:18.350]  in supermarkets over time.
[32:18.390 --> 32:22.350]  So just to kind of give you a, to set the baseline on that.
[32:22.350 --> 32:24.710]  If you wanted to break that out by region,
[32:26.070 --> 32:28.470]  interestingly enough, up in the Northeast,
[32:28.470 --> 32:30.470]  that New York, Pennsylvania area
[32:30.470 --> 32:34.790]  is really what been a big chunk of the sales for 2019,
[32:34.790 --> 32:38.910]  all along the coast, which I would have expected.
[32:38.910 --> 32:43.070]  The North, East North Central is also a fairly big area.
[32:44.590 --> 32:47.550]  Still got some issues in the South and the Southeast,
[32:47.550 --> 32:52.110]  East South Central to really get some additional sales
[32:52.110 --> 32:57.110]  in that space, at least as we look at this for 2019.
[32:57.350 --> 32:59.150]  So, but as I mentioned,
[32:59.150 --> 33:01.390]  this is only on the grain side of things.
[33:01.390 --> 33:04.110]  We have not been able yet to really pull much in
[33:04.110 --> 33:05.390]  on the CBD side of things.
[33:05.390 --> 33:07.430]  Some of the new data for 2020
[33:07.430 --> 33:11.030]  has a few more CBD products in it
[33:11.030 --> 33:14.310]  that we'll be able to break out specifically for it as well.
[33:15.310 --> 33:19.870]  If you wanted to look at this from another standpoint,
[33:19.870 --> 33:23.630]  this right here, so I talked about infused beverages.
[33:23.630 --> 33:26.750]  That right now is really the area that's growing the most
[33:26.750 --> 33:31.070]  and their quickest is in these beverage spaces.
[33:31.070 --> 33:32.710]  And it's been a pretty hot topic
[33:32.710 --> 33:34.990]  that we're trying to dig more into,
[33:34.990 --> 33:38.390]  into what type of beverages they're really looking at
[33:38.390 --> 33:40.190]  and what types of ingredients are going
[33:40.190 --> 33:42.470]  into those beverages.
[33:42.470 --> 33:46.430]  Now, keep in mind, you got some hurdles to get over here
[33:46.430 --> 33:48.830]  from you can't really put CBD in food
[33:50.310 --> 33:51.990]  unless you're in certain states.
[33:53.110 --> 33:56.270]  So most of this right now should be in hemp grain,
[33:56.270 --> 33:57.470]  but what does that look like
[33:57.470 --> 33:59.670]  and what types of beverages are those going in?
[33:59.670 --> 34:01.830]  I was seeing a pretty big drop in the general foods,
[34:01.830 --> 34:03.790]  but part of this is also,
[34:03.790 --> 34:06.150]  they've been in the process of reorganizing
[34:06.150 --> 34:09.350]  some of the UPC codes and some of this
[34:09.350 --> 34:11.270]  in the descriptions on where they fall at
[34:11.270 --> 34:12.150]  in the grocery store.
[34:13.070 --> 34:15.990]  We're trying to sort through some of those issues as well.
[34:17.390 --> 34:19.630]  And we're starting to see a big uptick
[34:19.630 --> 34:21.270]  on the liquor side as well.
[34:21.270 --> 34:23.870]  So it's been interesting to look at this data.
[34:25.030 --> 34:26.590]  As I mentioned, we're getting deeper
[34:26.590 --> 34:28.510]  and deeper into this research.
[34:28.510 --> 34:31.510]  We'll have something out later this summer
[34:31.510 --> 34:33.470]  that really digs more into this
[34:33.470 --> 34:37.150]  and provides a more national market scope
[34:37.150 --> 34:39.550]  for what all's going on in this market.
[34:40.550 --> 34:43.190]  We're also doing some surveys on the backside too,
[34:43.190 --> 34:46.230]  trying to look at who all's seeking information
[34:46.230 --> 34:48.070]  on hemp products.
[34:48.070 --> 34:53.070]  So the nice part is that 39% of our survey
[34:53.270 --> 34:57.070]  have at least seen, have heard or seen information
[34:57.070 --> 34:58.390]  on hemp products,
[34:58.390 --> 35:00.630]  but they really don't pay much attention.
[35:00.630 --> 35:02.630]  So we've got it, we've got it, they've heard of it.
[35:02.630 --> 35:06.750]  Now we've got to move them from this point
[35:06.750 --> 35:08.510]  over to this point where they pay attention,
[35:08.950 --> 35:10.150]  it catches their eye,
[35:10.150 --> 35:14.030]  and then hopefully into this, seek more information on it
[35:14.030 --> 35:15.470]  so they have a deeper understanding
[35:15.470 --> 35:17.070]  of what these products are,
[35:17.070 --> 35:19.150]  what they bring to the table.
[35:20.910 --> 35:24.470]  Got more information on, you know,
[35:24.470 --> 35:26.350]  on attitudes towards hemp production.
[35:26.350 --> 35:28.870]  And Asadasha mentioned that this is a study
[35:28.870 --> 35:30.950]  out of the University of Vermont.
[35:30.950 --> 35:33.390]  One of our grad students at the University of Vermont
[35:33.390 --> 35:36.190]  has been working on this for part of her dissertation.
[35:37.110 --> 35:40.750]  And we've been looking at pet foods.
[35:40.750 --> 35:44.030]  So their neutral attitudes towards hemp and pet foods,
[35:45.710 --> 35:48.030]  you know, a portion of them are also positive
[35:48.030 --> 35:49.510]  to highly positive on that.
[35:49.510 --> 35:53.310]  We've started to see some states institute policies
[35:53.310 --> 35:55.830]  that allow these types of products
[35:55.830 --> 35:57.750]  into those market channels,
[35:57.750 --> 35:59.470]  which is interesting,
[35:59.470 --> 36:01.910]  given that it's still illegal at the federal level,
[36:01.910 --> 36:04.030]  but we are starting to see states move that direction
[36:04.030 --> 36:07.030]  and that you're starting to see some of that show up
[36:07.030 --> 36:08.670]  in this data as well.
[36:08.670 --> 36:11.350]  Construction materials is another one
[36:11.350 --> 36:13.590]  that people are really positive on for this industry.
[36:13.590 --> 36:14.830]  Plastics, you know,
[36:14.830 --> 36:16.950]  and I think these are kind of two low hanging fruits,
[36:16.950 --> 36:19.630]  probably the construction industry first,
[36:19.630 --> 36:21.550]  especially from the fiber side,
[36:21.550 --> 36:25.270]  which also has, can get into some of the carbon side
[36:25.270 --> 36:26.510]  of the coin as well.
[36:26.510 --> 36:28.230]  So it's got some interesting components there
[36:28.230 --> 36:30.750]  that feed back into the production space,
[36:30.750 --> 36:33.710]  but we could delve deeper into those if somebody wanted to.
[36:35.550 --> 36:37.390]  We still see quite a bit of people out there
[36:37.390 --> 36:39.110]  thinking about the clothing and textiles,
[36:39.110 --> 36:42.670]  but their attitudes aren't quite as positive on it
[36:42.670 --> 36:44.750]  as they are some of the other products that are out there.
[36:44.750 --> 36:49.750]  So, you know, just something to keep in mind
[36:49.950 --> 36:52.590]  as you go forward and as this industry moves forward.
[36:54.070 --> 36:55.430]  So kind of looking forward,
[36:56.710 --> 36:58.550]  you know, from the policy standpoint,
[36:58.550 --> 37:01.190]  I'm really looking forward to the 2023 Farm Bill
[37:01.190 --> 37:03.350]  and what changes we're going to make in that
[37:03.350 --> 37:05.870]  and how we're going to move this industry forward.
[37:05.870 --> 37:07.430]  The types of regulations, you know,
[37:07.430 --> 37:09.870]  there's a plan out there for an exemption
[37:09.870 --> 37:12.750]  for grain and fiber production.
[37:12.750 --> 37:16.470]  That's an interesting piece that's been put out there.
[37:16.470 --> 37:18.030]  Even if those crops go hot,
[37:18.030 --> 37:20.830]  given that they're growing it for grain or fiber,
[37:20.830 --> 37:22.190]  they would be exempt from having to do
[37:22.190 --> 37:23.470]  those testing components.
[37:24.510 --> 37:26.830]  Trade is another interesting piece,
[37:26.830 --> 37:29.470]  especially if we move to the 1%.
[37:29.470 --> 37:32.630]  If you move to 1%, I would say that on the downside,
[37:32.630 --> 37:34.430]  you know, you've restricted market access
[37:34.430 --> 37:35.470]  for a lot of producers,
[37:35.470 --> 37:38.390]  because if you go from 0.3% to 1%,
[37:38.390 --> 37:41.150]  you don't need nearly as many producers,
[37:41.150 --> 37:44.710]  especially on the floral side of the coin
[37:44.710 --> 37:46.670]  as you do at the 0.3%.
[37:46.670 --> 37:49.310]  So something to think about from that space.
[37:49.310 --> 37:52.350]  The trade side of the coin, if we go to 1%,
[37:52.350 --> 37:55.310]  there may be some countries that now won't trade with us
[37:55.310 --> 37:57.510]  as they have a 0% THC rule.
[37:57.510 --> 37:58.990]  So how do we get around that?
[37:58.990 --> 38:01.270]  Can we actually play in that space?
[38:01.270 --> 38:06.270]  And will countries actually talk to us with a 1% rule?
[38:06.630 --> 38:09.150]  I think some will, I think some won't.
[38:09.150 --> 38:11.190]  So that's been a big issue.
[38:11.190 --> 38:13.270]  Investment, public and private.
[38:13.270 --> 38:14.910]  So we've seen a lot of private investment,
[38:14.910 --> 38:17.990]  especially in the fiber side of the coin
[38:17.990 --> 38:20.630]  and in the grain side of the coin going in,
[38:20.630 --> 38:21.870]  but it's got, you know,
[38:21.870 --> 38:24.990]  this crop was out of production for 80 years
[38:25.670 --> 38:26.910]  and really hasn't had any,
[38:26.910 --> 38:28.310]  very little research done on it.
[38:28.310 --> 38:32.310]  So it's taking a lot of effort on the private side
[38:32.310 --> 38:33.430]  to get that done.
[38:33.430 --> 38:37.270]  But as many of you probably saw within the last week,
[38:37.270 --> 38:40.790]  NIFA put out its piece on the public funding
[38:40.790 --> 38:42.990]  that it's been providing for the hemp industry.
[38:42.990 --> 38:45.470]  And I was proud to say that several of our projects
[38:45.470 --> 38:49.230]  that I'm on were in that publication.
[38:49.230 --> 38:50.790]  And I think there's more public funding
[38:50.790 --> 38:52.870]  to come on that front.
[38:52.870 --> 38:54.150]  From a production standpoint,
[38:54.150 --> 38:56.950]  I think I will see an uptick in grain and fiber acres.
[38:56.950 --> 39:00.150]  Commodity prices are gonna continue to be a problem
[39:00.150 --> 39:01.670]  to compete with those other commodities.
[39:01.670 --> 39:06.670]  Biomass supply has dropped from those oversupply days,
[39:07.110 --> 39:10.550]  but there's still quite a bit left out there on the market
[39:10.550 --> 39:12.390]  that we still haven't completely worked through.
[39:12.390 --> 39:14.470]  So I think we'll see floral production acres flat
[39:14.470 --> 39:16.950]  to down a little bit again for this year,
[39:16.950 --> 39:20.470]  but this will also be very location dependent
[39:20.470 --> 39:22.430]  as there are some locations around the country,
[39:22.470 --> 39:25.070]  specifically maybe up in the Northeast
[39:25.070 --> 39:29.030]  that I'm starting to hear grumblings or rumblings
[39:29.030 --> 39:32.550]  of those prices being fairly strong
[39:32.550 --> 39:37.390]  for the 2020 or 2022 production period.
[39:37.390 --> 39:38.350]  On the consumer side,
[39:38.350 --> 39:40.030]  I think we have a lot of market confusion
[39:40.030 --> 39:41.710]  that we've really got to work through
[39:41.710 --> 39:44.150]  if we're going to educate these consumers
[39:44.150 --> 39:47.110]  and bring them on board as hemp producers.
[39:47.110 --> 39:49.630]  Labeling regulations such as grass
[39:49.630 --> 39:51.590]  are also gonna be important.
[39:51.630 --> 39:52.710]  Can we get those done?
[39:52.710 --> 39:55.150]  Because consumers, we know consumers care
[39:55.150 --> 39:56.270]  about what they put in their body.
[39:56.270 --> 39:58.710]  So are we gonna have the right labeling
[39:58.710 --> 39:59.750]  and what type of regulations
[39:59.750 --> 40:02.030]  are we gonna have in place for that?
[40:02.030 --> 40:03.950]  Need to understand non-consumers.
[40:03.950 --> 40:05.870]  So why are these people non-consumers
[40:05.870 --> 40:09.270]  and what would switch them to the other side of the coin?
[40:09.270 --> 40:12.350]  From the processing side and manufacturer side,
[40:12.350 --> 40:15.110]  consumers are paying a lot of attention,
[40:15.110 --> 40:16.790]  but you're gonna have to catch their attention.
[40:16.790 --> 40:19.830]  So what was really nice early on in this industry
[40:19.870 --> 40:21.990]  is we got a lot of free advertising.
[40:21.990 --> 40:25.710]  So as this industry was really growing into 2019,
[40:27.110 --> 40:29.430]  they were talking about this being a golden ticket
[40:29.430 --> 40:32.470]  and being the crop that's gonna solve everything.
[40:32.470 --> 40:34.310]  Well, that's no longer the case today.
[40:34.310 --> 40:36.990]  And now the media will talk about this crop
[40:36.990 --> 40:41.990]  as it's bubbles burst and it's done, but it's not done.
[40:42.390 --> 40:45.710]  So we're gonna have to figure out how to advertise
[40:45.870 --> 40:50.870]  and communicate the benefits of this crop going forward.
[40:52.470 --> 40:55.230]  So this is my contact information.
[40:55.230 --> 40:58.070]  Please feel free to reach out to me
[40:58.070 --> 41:00.070]  about any of these topics
[41:00.070 --> 41:03.350]  or any other hemp topics you would like to talk about.
[41:03.350 --> 41:05.310]  I did stick over here on the right-hand side
[41:05.310 --> 41:07.630]  because all this work that you're seeing
[41:07.630 --> 41:12.230]  and even more behind the scenes would not be possible
[41:12.230 --> 41:13.630]  without the funding agencies
[41:13.630 --> 41:16.070]  that are funding a lot of this research
[41:16.070 --> 41:19.790]  to help move this industry forward.
[41:19.790 --> 41:21.230]  So I'm gonna stop there
[41:22.550 --> 41:26.150]  and let's answer some questions if there are any.
[41:30.660 --> 41:32.580]  Awesome talk, Tyler.
[41:32.580 --> 41:35.100]  Yeah, so we have a bunch of questions in the chat.
[41:36.860 --> 41:37.980]  One person asks,
[41:37.980 --> 41:42.500]  why did the price in Oregon fall to zero in September, 2020?
[41:43.500 --> 41:48.340]  Yeah, so for that, the price in Oregon,
[41:48.340 --> 41:49.860]  I think fell to zero in that year
[41:49.860 --> 41:53.260]  because of the wildfires that they had out there that year.
[41:53.260 --> 41:54.940]  So there was almost no crop,
[41:54.940 --> 41:57.460]  if I remember correctly, from that.
[41:57.460 --> 41:59.660]  So they didn't report out a price that year.
[42:04.020 --> 42:04.860]  Great.
[42:05.820 --> 42:06.900]  Another question asks,
[42:06.900 --> 42:08.220]  what percentage of states
[42:08.220 --> 42:10.820]  have formed commodity commissions for hemp?
[42:10.820 --> 42:12.580]  Do most have checkoffs?
[42:15.860 --> 42:17.500]  So there have been a lot of states
[42:17.500 --> 42:22.500]  that have formed all these little commissions and groups.
[42:22.620 --> 42:25.180]  I think that's one thing that we're seeing
[42:25.180 --> 42:27.420]  with a very young infant industry
[42:27.420 --> 42:29.940]  is a lot of those commodity groups have not congealed
[42:29.940 --> 42:32.500]  and kind of come together and had one voice yet.
[42:32.500 --> 42:34.780]  So I think as this industry continues to develop,
[42:34.780 --> 42:39.420]  we'll start to see that piece come together
[42:39.420 --> 42:42.580]  and help strengthen this industry to that point.
[42:42.580 --> 42:47.580]  Now, in terms of how you asked about checkoff programs,
[42:48.980 --> 42:53.500]  right now, to my knowledge, there is no checkoff program.
[42:53.500 --> 42:55.660]  They've been trying to pursue a checkoff program,
[42:55.660 --> 42:58.500]  but to my knowledge, it hadn't been completely set up yet.
[43:03.990 --> 43:07.670]  This question asks,
[43:07.670 --> 43:10.030]  is there enough demand for seed and fiber
[43:10.030 --> 43:11.470]  to grow this industry?
[43:12.470 --> 43:16.510]  Well, that's a great question.
[43:16.510 --> 43:19.030]  And I think there is enough demand.
[43:19.030 --> 43:21.750]  I think it's just taking a whole lot of infrastructure
[43:21.750 --> 43:23.630]  to get that demand up and running.
[43:23.630 --> 43:25.390]  So I mean, I think there is,
[43:27.230 --> 43:30.030]  there are a lot of people who want to consume this grain,
[43:30.030 --> 43:32.310]  but they really haven't gotten to the point
[43:32.310 --> 43:33.230]  of being able to consume it
[43:33.230 --> 43:37.590]  because it's a fairly high cost superfood,
[43:37.590 --> 43:39.790]  I guess, if you want to call it a superfood.
[43:40.790 --> 43:43.550]  It's a fairly high cost piece on that side.
[43:43.550 --> 43:46.510]  In terms of the fiber side, it's still fairly highly cost,
[43:46.510 --> 43:48.590]  it's still pretty costly.
[43:48.590 --> 43:51.270]  So we got to get production up
[43:51.270 --> 43:52.790]  to bring those costs of production down,
[43:52.790 --> 43:54.190]  but it's also a chicken and egg too,
[43:54.190 --> 43:56.030]  because most producers aren't going to move forward
[43:56.030 --> 43:59.870]  with production until they have a place to go with that.
[43:59.870 --> 44:01.510]  So it's been a struggle,
[44:01.510 --> 44:05.230]  but I think we're starting to see more and more companies
[44:05.230 --> 44:06.990]  and investments being made to that.
[44:09.460 --> 44:10.300]  Awesome.
[44:11.780 --> 44:13.180]  Other question asks,
[44:13.180 --> 44:16.420]  do you have storage cost data for raw flowers
[44:16.420 --> 44:20.380]  over 12 months or extracted CBD over the same timeframe?
[44:21.900 --> 44:23.700]  That's data right now we don't have.
[44:23.700 --> 44:26.900]  It is part of our production cost survey
[44:26.900 --> 44:28.340]  that we have put together.
[44:28.340 --> 44:30.780]  However, we, as I kind of mentioned,
[44:30.780 --> 44:32.420]  that's still stuck in OMB
[44:32.420 --> 44:34.220]  and we haven't been able to send that out.
[44:34.220 --> 44:36.460]  So, but that's something we're really trying
[44:36.980 --> 44:37.980]  to get a handle on is,
[44:37.980 --> 44:40.460]  is what is that storage costs over 12 months?
[44:40.460 --> 44:41.620]  And in addition beyond that,
[44:41.620 --> 44:43.660]  when you start to store it over 12 months,
[44:43.660 --> 44:48.460]  what is the degradation of those CBD
[44:48.460 --> 44:50.780]  and other compounds that are in that?
[44:50.780 --> 44:51.940]  And is there degradation?
[44:51.940 --> 44:54.300]  And what is the best storage method to look at that?
[44:54.300 --> 44:56.220]  So we've done some really brief studies
[44:56.220 --> 44:57.660]  at the University of Kentucky
[44:58.700 --> 45:00.780]  to look at different storage methods.
[45:00.780 --> 45:03.020]  One storage method would be just to store it
[45:03.020 --> 45:07.500]  in a super sack in a raw floral material
[45:07.500 --> 45:09.140]  at the proper moisture level.
[45:09.140 --> 45:11.220]  We've done some freeze drying of it.
[45:11.220 --> 45:12.420]  Freeze drying is really nice,
[45:12.420 --> 45:14.620]  but it's also really expensive.
[45:14.620 --> 45:18.620]  So, we're kind of still looking at that.
[45:22.360 --> 45:23.680]  Great.
[45:23.680 --> 45:24.880]  A question asks,
[45:24.880 --> 45:28.320]  does Canada have registered pesticides for its hemp?
[45:28.320 --> 45:29.160]  Yes, they do.
[45:29.160 --> 45:33.760]  But there also have been grain producers for 30 plus years.
[45:33.760 --> 45:35.960]  So they have a lot longer history in that space.
[45:35.960 --> 45:38.440]  And they do have chemicals approved up there.
[45:38.440 --> 45:39.400]  And within the US,
[45:39.400 --> 45:41.240]  I guess I should be a little more clear on that.
[45:41.240 --> 45:42.720]  We do have some chemicals approved,
[45:42.720 --> 45:44.520]  but they're all biological chemicals.
[45:44.520 --> 45:49.520]  So, they're fit more into that organic production space
[45:49.960 --> 45:51.640]  probably than many others.
[45:55.660 --> 45:56.500]  Great.
[45:56.500 --> 45:57.340]  Another question asks,
[45:57.340 --> 46:00.260]  are there any market distinctions recognizing short
[46:00.260 --> 46:01.980]  and or long hemp fiber?
[46:02.980 --> 46:09.260]  So, I think depending upon the industry
[46:09.380 --> 46:10.380]  you're trying to go into,
[46:10.380 --> 46:11.540]  I think that's one of the things
[46:11.540 --> 46:15.140]  that we really need to take into consideration.
[46:15.140 --> 46:16.580]  So, for example,
[46:16.580 --> 46:21.220]  if you were going into a process of flooring, hemp flooring,
[46:21.220 --> 46:22.900]  that's gonna use the whole plant.
[46:22.900 --> 46:25.500]  Well, they don't really care about what,
[46:25.500 --> 46:27.180]  if it's long or short strand fibers,
[46:27.180 --> 46:29.180]  because it's all going into one piece.
[46:29.180 --> 46:30.940]  Now you get into the textile space,
[46:30.940 --> 46:33.900]  you get into some of the other end products.
[46:33.900 --> 46:35.220]  Yes, they care about that length.
[46:35.220 --> 46:36.500]  And I think that's been one of the things
[46:36.500 --> 46:39.060]  that the fiber industry has really struggled with,
[46:39.060 --> 46:41.220]  is when we originally rolled a lot of this out,
[46:41.220 --> 46:43.940]  we just would put fiber seed out in the field
[46:43.940 --> 46:45.260]  and said, we'll produce it.
[46:45.260 --> 46:47.100]  And it was kind of this field of dreams
[46:47.100 --> 46:49.780]  and the industry will come.
[46:49.780 --> 46:52.300]  Well, we can't really think about it in that way.
[46:52.300 --> 46:53.940]  We have to start with the end product.
[46:53.940 --> 46:55.660]  Where's it going?
[46:55.660 --> 46:57.100]  Is it going into bioplastics?
[46:57.100 --> 47:00.860]  Is it going into the automobile manufacturing industry?
[47:01.740 --> 47:04.300]  Is it going into fiber and start to think
[47:04.300 --> 47:06.100]  and work back down the supply chain
[47:06.100 --> 47:09.660]  or up the supply chain to the producer
[47:09.660 --> 47:11.660]  to get the right genetics and stuff in place
[47:11.660 --> 47:13.860]  to produce that type of fiber.
[47:13.860 --> 47:17.740]  So we're starting to see more along that lines moving forward
[47:17.740 --> 47:19.940]  but it's been a struggle to get there.
[47:23.280 --> 47:24.240]  Great.
[47:24.240 --> 47:26.560]  Another question from Ernie Sieber in Alabama,
[47:26.560 --> 47:30.040]  and asks, what's the projected economics
[47:30.040 --> 47:32.280]  of the growing medical cannabis industry
[47:32.920 --> 47:35.080]  as more states are legalizing the process?
[47:36.720 --> 47:39.800]  Well, I can't say I've done a whole lot of work
[47:39.800 --> 47:41.720]  in the medical cannabis side of things,
[47:41.720 --> 47:45.000]  but what I can say is that we had a medical cannabis bill
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  introduced in the state of Kentucky.
[47:48.120 --> 47:52.280]  And from the rough estimates that we were doing on that,
[47:52.280 --> 47:54.200]  I mean, from a production standpoint,
[47:54.200 --> 47:57.160]  I think it was gonna take like 14, 15 acres
[47:57.160 --> 47:59.800]  to produce enough cannabis for the medical side,
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.880]  depend upon what the assumptions were
[48:02.440 --> 48:03.800]  on the number of consumers
[48:04.800 --> 48:07.000]  to satisfy the state of Kentucky's need.
[48:08.240 --> 48:11.320]  So from that standpoint, it's not a whole lot of acres.
[48:11.320 --> 48:15.200]  Now you can juxtapose that to the tax side of the coin.
[48:15.200 --> 48:17.560]  And yes, there would be a lot of taxes on that side.
[48:17.560 --> 48:21.320]  Now we did not get into estimating what those taxes are
[48:21.320 --> 48:23.160]  and how much that would benefit the state.
[48:23.160 --> 48:27.520]  But as we can see from states like Colorado, California,
[48:27.520 --> 48:31.080]  those tax benefits can be significant.
[48:32.880 --> 48:35.360]  Great, interesting question.
[48:35.360 --> 48:39.320]  Do you see hemp fiber processing as being a high value
[48:40.600 --> 48:42.560]  to various industries due to its ability
[48:42.560 --> 48:44.720]  to produce commodities across the board?
[48:44.720 --> 48:46.680]  And what percentage of fiber processors
[48:46.680 --> 48:49.960]  do we have across the US to handle this volume?
[48:49.960 --> 48:52.360]  Well, a lot of the fiber processors across the country
[48:52.360 --> 48:54.200]  are very small at this point, Tom.
[48:54.200 --> 48:58.040]  So that is one of the issues.
[48:58.040 --> 49:00.640]  Now the question becomes is what type of fiber processing
[49:00.640 --> 49:01.480]  do we wanna do?
[49:02.040 --> 49:02.880]  I mean, there are processes out there
[49:02.880 --> 49:04.720]  that we can chemically reddit.
[49:04.720 --> 49:06.000]  There are processes out there
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.400]  that don't require necessarily decortication to happen
[49:10.400 --> 49:13.520]  or can decortication can be done in a different method.
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.480]  So, keep in mind the decortication process
[49:17.480 --> 49:20.400]  is really there to break it into the herd, the bast,
[49:21.680 --> 49:23.440]  primarily herd and the bast side of things.
[49:23.440 --> 49:26.560]  So if you really wanna think about it
[49:26.560 --> 49:29.480]  from a textile standpoint, you're really in the bast game.
[49:29.480 --> 49:32.640]  But unfortunately as a decorticator
[49:32.640 --> 49:35.240]  in terms of volume for that decorticator,
[49:35.240 --> 49:36.760]  you're really in the herd side of things.
[49:36.760 --> 49:39.480]  So you've gotta find markets for both herd and bast,
[49:39.480 --> 49:42.040]  specifically herd to think about
[49:42.040 --> 49:44.880]  how you become profitable in that space.
[49:45.880 --> 49:48.240]  But most of those fiber processors right now
[49:48.240 --> 49:49.760]  on a fairly small scale,
[49:49.760 --> 49:51.600]  I mean, I've heard of some processors.
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.320]  There are some processors starting this year in 2022
[49:55.320 --> 49:58.520]  that are larger and I think will grow in scale.
[49:58.520 --> 50:02.080]  But commercial scale, they'll be commercial scale,
[50:02.080 --> 50:03.960]  but on the small side of commercial scale.
[50:03.960 --> 50:06.640]  So we're still several years out there.
[50:10.080 --> 50:14.760]  A couple of questions regarding the 2023 farm bill.
[50:14.760 --> 50:18.080]  I guess this makes farmers become licensed
[50:18.080 --> 50:19.480]  with their individual states
[50:19.480 --> 50:21.960]  if they're already sending data to FSA.
[50:22.840 --> 50:27.080]  Do you think that this is good for the hemp industry?
[50:27.080 --> 50:30.560]  Do you think it needs to be lobbied to be removed?
[50:30.560 --> 50:32.360]  Like what are your thoughts on that?
[50:35.920 --> 50:37.560]  That's not really something that,
[50:38.840 --> 50:41.480]  I get into analyzing the policies that are made,
[50:41.480 --> 50:43.560]  not really setting the policy.
[50:43.560 --> 50:45.800]  So that's been one of those really interesting pieces.
[50:45.800 --> 50:47.560]  Now to go along with that though,
[50:50.600 --> 50:53.280]  it depends upon how the regulatory framework is set up.
[50:53.280 --> 50:55.640]  I mean, there's a couple of other questions in here
[50:55.640 --> 50:59.280]  about legalization of the medical of marijuana
[51:00.320 --> 51:02.200]  and how it affects the industry.
[51:02.200 --> 51:04.680]  If marijuana is legalized across the country,
[51:04.680 --> 51:06.720]  it probably changes the whole paradigm
[51:06.720 --> 51:11.720]  of how this crop is managed from a regulatory standpoint.
[51:12.520 --> 51:16.080]  So that is one of those pieces to think about and watch.
[51:16.080 --> 51:17.880]  Now I will say that the marijuana industry
[51:17.880 --> 51:19.000]  and the hemp industry right now
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.440]  are almost in direct competition
[51:20.440 --> 51:22.640]  when you think about Delta-8
[51:22.640 --> 51:23.760]  and some of the other products,
[51:23.960 --> 51:25.320]  specifically Delta-8.
[51:26.520 --> 51:27.480]  And I think that's something
[51:27.480 --> 51:30.200]  the industry really needs to think about
[51:30.200 --> 51:33.280]  is how you deal with that going forward.
[51:33.280 --> 51:37.200]  Because if we are under the same tax regulations
[51:37.200 --> 51:39.120]  as the marijuana industry,
[51:39.120 --> 51:41.480]  I think it becomes a real struggle
[51:41.480 --> 51:43.400]  for this industry to be profitable.
[51:44.400 --> 51:45.440]  But at the same time,
[51:45.440 --> 51:47.560]  I understand why processors have done it
[51:47.560 --> 51:51.160]  because that's how they survived the downturn
[51:51.160 --> 51:54.160]  in the pricing since 2019.
[51:54.160 --> 51:56.000]  But I guess to try and get that back,
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.960]  do I think you should have to be licensed with both?
[51:59.960 --> 52:01.560]  It's a bit of a burden right now,
[52:01.560 --> 52:03.440]  and I would agree that it is a burden.
[52:04.520 --> 52:07.080]  But I think the other piece of that too is
[52:09.320 --> 52:10.400]  just because the data,
[52:10.400 --> 52:12.720]  the only data that's going to FSA
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.280]  is planted and harvested acres.
[52:17.280 --> 52:18.760]  So they're not doing anything
[52:18.760 --> 52:21.400]  with the regulatory component of,
[52:21.400 --> 52:22.720]  is it hemp or is it marijuana?
[52:22.720 --> 52:24.600]  So they're not doing anything on the testing side.
[52:24.600 --> 52:28.200]  Until that testing requirement gets rid of that,
[52:28.200 --> 52:30.360]  then I think you're either going to have to report
[52:30.360 --> 52:31.840]  to the state or you're going to have to report
[52:31.840 --> 52:36.440]  to the federal government through the USDA hemp program.
[52:36.440 --> 52:37.840]  One of the two on that,
[52:37.840 --> 52:39.680]  and until they change that.
[52:44.370 --> 52:45.490]  Awesome, thank you.
[52:45.490 --> 52:48.090]  Another question asks,
[52:48.090 --> 52:51.730]  the major variation on planted versus harvested acres
[52:52.570 --> 52:54.690]  in Colorado in one of your slides,
[52:54.690 --> 52:57.970]  is there an explanation or is that an indication
[52:57.970 --> 52:59.770]  of an alternate underground market?
[53:00.730 --> 53:02.490]  So, no, it's not necessarily an underground market.
[53:02.490 --> 53:04.130]  If you were to look at Kentucky,
[53:04.130 --> 53:05.530]  it's the same issue there too.
[53:05.530 --> 53:08.850]  So take, for example, in the state of Kentucky,
[53:08.850 --> 53:11.370]  you have to have a license to hold the raw material.
[53:11.370 --> 53:14.290]  So if you've been holding that material since 2019,
[53:14.290 --> 53:17.290]  you still have a license and you still have a planted,
[53:18.290 --> 53:21.290]  a number that's planted or licensed,
[53:23.210 --> 53:24.850]  but you may not have harvested it.
[53:24.850 --> 53:27.330]  So, and you're also seeing a lot of failures
[53:27.330 --> 53:28.850]  that take place in these.
[53:28.850 --> 53:31.770]  So one, it never, you planted it,
[53:31.770 --> 53:34.890]  but it failed to come out of the ground or it failed.
[53:34.890 --> 53:37.530]  You had lots of weed pressure, so you bush hogged it down.
[53:37.530 --> 53:39.690]  So you start to see a lot of discrepancies
[53:39.690 --> 53:40.730]  in there as well.
[53:40.730 --> 53:42.250]  And if you were to look at Kentucky numbers,
[53:42.250 --> 53:44.210]  you see a lot of discrepancies between planted
[53:44.210 --> 53:46.450]  and harvested in general.
[53:47.450 --> 53:50.410]  So I think that's a common trend you see across the country
[53:50.410 --> 53:52.290]  but that is something to think about,
[53:53.570 --> 53:56.450]  is there's a licensed acres, there's a planted acres
[53:56.450 --> 53:57.930]  and there are harvested acres.
[53:57.930 --> 54:01.050]  And those vary quite differently from one state to the next.
[54:04.110 --> 54:05.310]  Great.
[54:05.310 --> 54:06.790]  Another question asks,
[54:06.790 --> 54:09.510]  where are you seeing private and public cooperation
[54:09.510 --> 54:11.990]  or collaboration in developing supply chains
[54:11.990 --> 54:14.270]  specific to various market channels?
[54:15.190 --> 54:16.030]  Sure.
[54:17.350 --> 54:19.790]  Ask that question one more time.
[54:19.790 --> 54:22.590]  Where, I guess, like what states are you seeing
[54:22.590 --> 54:24.710]  or where are you seeing in the country,
[54:24.710 --> 54:27.550]  private and public cooperation or collaboration
[54:27.550 --> 54:30.590]  in developing supply chains that are specific
[54:30.590 --> 54:33.750]  to specific markets?
[54:33.750 --> 54:35.950]  So I will tell you one of the really cool,
[54:35.950 --> 54:40.750]  well, Colorado is probably out in front of a lot of states.
[54:40.750 --> 54:42.350]  They have what they call the Champ Report,
[54:42.350 --> 54:44.190]  which was a very large effort
[54:45.430 --> 54:48.710]  on the part of Colorado State University
[54:48.710 --> 54:51.030]  and the Colorado Department of Ag
[54:51.030 --> 54:53.670]  to bring all the constituents and stakeholders
[54:53.670 --> 54:55.910]  from across the state on all levels
[54:55.910 --> 54:57.430]  of the supply chain together
[54:57.430 --> 55:00.110]  and try and put together a comprehensive plan
[55:00.110 --> 55:02.070]  for the development of hemp in that state.
[55:02.070 --> 55:04.310]  And you can go out and find the Champ Report
[55:04.310 --> 55:06.390]  online for that state.
[55:06.390 --> 55:09.590]  That's probably a state that is moving forward
[55:09.590 --> 55:11.230]  on that side of things.
[55:11.230 --> 55:12.750]  New York is another example
[55:12.750 --> 55:16.710]  with their food science lab there in Geneva
[55:16.710 --> 55:18.630]  and some of the things that they have going on
[55:18.630 --> 55:19.950]  on that side of the coin.
[55:20.870 --> 55:23.270]  So, I mean, there's lots of examples out there,
[55:24.230 --> 55:26.270]  especially in some of those early states.
[55:30.950 --> 55:33.990]  This question asks, any forward-thinking uses
[55:33.990 --> 55:36.550]  being utilized for alternative products for fiber
[55:36.550 --> 55:39.270]  on the West Coast, such as trash bags and paper
[55:39.270 --> 55:42.150]  that can be utilized in the Southeast region
[55:42.190 --> 55:44.150]  to create a need for hemp acreage?
[55:45.750 --> 55:48.750]  So, yeah, there are a lot of things.
[55:48.750 --> 55:50.590]  So we were just out at NOCO
[55:50.590 --> 55:55.390]  and there was a lot of hemp being put into plastic bags,
[55:56.230 --> 55:58.190]  into those, not necessarily pencils,
[55:58.190 --> 56:01.670]  but they're trying to get into some of those consumables
[56:01.670 --> 56:05.190]  that I think could generate some additional acres
[56:05.190 --> 56:06.350]  in the Southeast.
[56:06.350 --> 56:07.550]  I think in the Southeast, though,
[56:07.550 --> 56:09.870]  we're still struggling with the right genetics
[56:10.750 --> 56:12.910]  to get at those lower latitudes
[56:13.750 --> 56:16.030]  or to get at the latitudes
[56:16.030 --> 56:17.470]  in the Southeast part of the US
[56:17.470 --> 56:21.750]  to really grow high quality fiber
[56:21.750 --> 56:22.990]  that's gonna go into some of those.
[56:22.990 --> 56:26.790]  So, yeah, I mean, it's coming along, but it's kind of slow.
[56:28.390 --> 56:30.070]  I wanted to jump in with a question
[56:30.070 --> 56:31.910]  that I addressed in the chat,
[56:31.910 --> 56:35.030]  but I thought this would be something
[56:35.030 --> 56:36.630]  our lab could speak to a little bit,
[56:36.630 --> 56:40.510]  and I'd love to hear Mark's opinion of as well.
[56:40.510 --> 56:44.430]  So Dave asks, are you aware of any efforts
[56:44.430 --> 56:48.510]  to establish fiber standards, grading, testing protocols,
[56:48.510 --> 56:51.510]  either in regional markets, private standards,
[56:51.510 --> 56:54.270]  or amongst state or federal entities?
[56:54.270 --> 56:55.750]  I'm thinking along the lines
[56:55.750 --> 56:58.190]  of USDA cotton and wool programs.
[56:58.190 --> 56:59.630]  So I love that question,
[56:59.630 --> 57:04.630]  and that's very near and dear to our heart at our laboratory.
[57:04.790 --> 57:09.790]  So we are developing a set of phenotypic standards
[57:10.230 --> 57:12.630]  for hemp fiber quality right now
[57:12.630 --> 57:14.510]  in conjunction with Chris Delhome
[57:14.510 --> 57:19.070]  at the Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans.
[57:19.070 --> 57:23.590]  We've developed a USDA hemp phenotyping handbook
[57:23.590 --> 57:28.590]  where we measure everything from fiber, oil,
[57:28.710 --> 57:31.350]  plant morphology, secondary metabolites,
[57:31.350 --> 57:33.190]  including cannabinoids,
[57:33.190 --> 57:36.750]  and develop rigorous ways of measuring those.
[57:36.750 --> 57:40.270]  So developing standards for hemp is interesting,
[57:40.270 --> 57:43.710]  and you mentioned cotton and wool programs.
[57:43.710 --> 57:48.150]  One similar analog that could be leveraged
[57:48.150 --> 57:49.950]  to help address this question
[57:49.950 --> 57:52.030]  is looking at a lot of the work done with flax.
[57:52.030 --> 57:54.790]  Flax is also a bass fiber.
[57:54.790 --> 57:59.790]  There's machinery that can evaluate flax fiber quality.
[58:01.310 --> 58:02.710]  Can that be applied to hemp?
[58:03.230 --> 58:04.390]  Well, that's an ongoing project
[58:04.390 --> 58:08.670]  that we've got going on with Chris Delhome in New Orleans.
[58:08.670 --> 58:13.590]  Interestingly, there are hemp fiber phenotyping machinery.
[58:13.590 --> 58:18.590]  Those were made in the USSR pre-fall of the Soviet Union.
[58:20.110 --> 58:25.110]  So that machinery is not really available nowadays,
[58:26.030 --> 58:27.470]  to the best of my knowledge.
[58:27.470 --> 58:32.190]  But Tyler is probably gonna have a lot of thoughts
[58:32.710 --> 58:36.230]  on the economics of fiber standards.
[58:36.230 --> 58:39.950]  So Zach, I'm glad to hear that you all are working on that,
[58:39.950 --> 58:42.990]  because I think that's one of the big issues
[58:42.990 --> 58:45.710]  that we're really facing within the industry,
[58:45.710 --> 58:48.150]  because I think we're missing the boat
[58:48.150 --> 58:50.030]  on how we're pricing this stuff.
[58:50.030 --> 58:52.630]  So if you wanna talk about the biomass segment,
[58:52.630 --> 58:54.390]  we're pricing it on a percent CBD.
[58:54.390 --> 58:57.870]  Well, CBD is not the only valuable component in that.
[58:57.870 --> 58:59.950]  Another industry that you might think about
[58:59.990 --> 59:02.590]  that has something kind of similar to that,
[59:02.590 --> 59:04.710]  that might be able to be used would be the sugar industry.
[59:04.710 --> 59:06.430]  Basically, when they bring it in,
[59:06.430 --> 59:11.430]  they base it on the theoretical sugar extract of that.
[59:12.150 --> 59:13.990]  So that would be another industry to think about
[59:13.990 --> 59:15.710]  that kind of does some of that.
[59:17.110 --> 59:18.910]  And I think we're missing the boat
[59:18.910 --> 59:20.310]  on the grain and fiber side as well.
[59:20.310 --> 59:22.230]  So on the fiber side, the quality component.
[59:22.230 --> 59:23.990]  And I think that really is gonna be driven
[59:23.990 --> 59:26.830]  by what those end uses for that are.
[59:26.830 --> 59:29.870]  And we really need to rethink that pricing model
[59:30.750 --> 59:32.190]  that sits there on the grain side.
[59:32.190 --> 59:34.390]  Unfortunately in the US, or fortunately in the US,
[59:34.390 --> 59:35.630]  however you wanna put it,
[59:37.470 --> 59:40.430]  soybeans are sold on a per bushel basis,
[59:40.430 --> 59:41.990]  not on the oil content.
[59:41.990 --> 59:44.910]  If you go to South America, oil content matters.
[59:44.910 --> 59:48.270]  And for this product, oil content should matter
[59:48.270 --> 59:50.950]  because it's pretty high in omega-6 and three.
[59:52.150 --> 59:55.190]  So it's got some other health implications
[59:55.190 --> 59:56.590]  that could also be in there
[59:56.590 --> 59:58.910]  that are something to consider as well.
[59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.110]  So I would be really interested, Zach,
[01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.550]  to talk with you some more about how that's working
[01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:07.150]  because this is also, some of this pricing stuff
[01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:09.070]  is also part of an ARS project.
[01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:13.030]  Awesome, and with that,
[01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:16.110]  I believe we hit the three o'clock mark.
[01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.030]  Thank you everyone for joining.
[01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:21.150]  Thank you, Dr. Mark, for giving that talk.
[01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.990]  Yeah, thank you for all your support
[01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.830]  throughout this webinar series.
[01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.110]  We're extremely grateful for it.
[01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:29.630]  And it's nice to see people
[01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:32.390]  from all different walks of life
[01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.950]  coming together to learn about hemp.
[01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:37.670]  Hey, and not to take the last word,
[01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:38.910]  but I just wanna echo that.
[01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:40.230]  This has been so much fun.
[01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:41.390]  I've learned so much,
[01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.030]  and I really appreciate all of the time
[01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.630]  y'all have spent here with us.
[01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.630]  So go grow some hemp, make some money,
[01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.590]  do some awesome research.
[01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:51.950]  Thanks again, everyone.
[01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:54.350]  Thank you all.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:06.980]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.820]  on the web at cornell.edu.
