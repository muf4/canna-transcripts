[00:00.000 --> 00:08.260]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.260 --> 00:12.840]  So this is our fifth year of doing small plot grain
[00:12.840 --> 00:16.420]  and fiber variety trials, I believe.
[00:16.420 --> 00:20.140]  And Luis is a relatively new student in my program,
[00:20.140 --> 00:21.380]  pursuing his PhD.
[00:21.380 --> 00:23.100]  I think if you were here last year,
[00:23.100 --> 00:27.620]  you heard Luis talk about trials.
[00:27.620 --> 00:30.700]  He's going to tell us about the fiber plots
[00:30.700 --> 00:33.220]  that we're standing in right here.
[00:33.220 --> 00:36.820]  And maybe a little bit about the dual purpose plots
[00:36.820 --> 00:41.580]  that don't look all that great.
[00:41.580 --> 00:42.820]  Well, thank you, Larry.
[00:42.820 --> 00:44.900]  First of all, who is wearing hemp fiber?
[00:47.580 --> 00:50.020]  That's disappointing.
[00:50.020 --> 00:53.020]  I am wearing one, 100% hemp fiber.
[00:53.020 --> 00:55.700]  So with that in mind, oh, you too?
[00:55.700 --> 00:58.580]  So with that in mind, I would like to pass this around.
[00:58.580 --> 01:00.620]  These are samples of hemp fiber.
[01:00.620 --> 01:01.260]  Oh, sorry.
[01:01.260 --> 01:03.580]  These are samples of hemp fiber and hemp herd.
[01:03.580 --> 01:05.700]  So I would like for you guys to take a look at it.
[01:05.700 --> 01:07.860]  Pretty much this is what we will get from this field
[01:07.860 --> 01:10.740]  after we harvest, we red, and we decoricate.
[01:10.740 --> 01:13.460]  So as Larry mentioned, there is an interest
[01:13.460 --> 01:17.060]  in the market for fiber and grain production.
[01:17.060 --> 01:20.660]  So we need to find cultivars that can fulfill such demand.
[01:20.660 --> 01:24.500]  So one efficient way to do that is with small plot trials,
[01:24.500 --> 01:26.300]  like the one that you're seeing right now.
[01:26.300 --> 01:28.860]  So here we have 12 cultivars that
[01:28.900 --> 01:35.420]  are replicated four times in 30 square foot area.
[01:35.420 --> 01:37.860]  We have five cultivars from France,
[01:37.860 --> 01:40.700]  and five cultivars from China, and one cultivar
[01:40.700 --> 01:44.700]  that was developed by the Cornell breeding program.
[01:44.700 --> 01:48.900]  So one thing that you know is that, well, OK,
[01:48.900 --> 01:52.780]  the small plot trial will help you estimate the yield.
[01:52.780 --> 01:53.700]  So that's great.
[01:53.700 --> 01:56.380]  That can help you fulfill a demand, and great.
[01:56.380 --> 01:58.060]  But how about the quality?
[01:58.060 --> 02:00.580]  And most importantly, what is quality?
[02:00.580 --> 02:02.380]  So one important thing that we need to know
[02:02.380 --> 02:07.580]  is how much of that can be used for textile, AKA the bast.
[02:07.580 --> 02:09.420]  How much of that is the herd?
[02:09.420 --> 02:11.060]  So if you have access to a handout,
[02:11.060 --> 02:14.460]  you can see on the back that we have results from last year,
[02:14.460 --> 02:16.220]  a strip trial, if you were here.
[02:16.220 --> 02:18.140]  And we observed that some cultivars
[02:18.140 --> 02:22.140]  were able to develop or to yield about,
[02:22.140 --> 02:26.220]  let me see, compared to the imperial system, that would be
[02:27.060 --> 02:31.260]  4.5 to 9 US tons per acre, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:31.260 --> 02:36.940]  And whereas others did not exceed 2.5 US tons per acre.
[02:36.940 --> 02:40.060]  So there is a considerable comparison across cultivars.
[02:40.060 --> 02:44.060]  Now, then when we talk about yield, then we have to harvest.
[02:44.060 --> 02:46.740]  Then we let them red to a specific point
[02:46.740 --> 02:48.940]  for a proper recordication.
[02:48.940 --> 02:51.260]  And we observe that these high yielding cultivars
[02:51.260 --> 02:55.660]  develop about two to four metric tons per hectare, which
[02:55.740 --> 03:01.860]  would be one or two US tons per acre.
[03:01.860 --> 03:03.740]  So that's pretty good, right?
[03:03.740 --> 03:06.460]  Now, the next challenge is, is it hot?
[03:06.460 --> 03:07.900]  Does it go hot?
[03:07.900 --> 03:09.460]  So when we sample these, we observe
[03:09.460 --> 03:11.980]  that two of those high yielding cultivars
[03:11.980 --> 03:15.260]  exceeded a 0.3% THC threshold.
[03:15.260 --> 03:16.740]  So that is very important, right?
[03:16.740 --> 03:18.620]  Because we can have a high yielding cultivar,
[03:18.620 --> 03:21.900]  but then your entire field will be completely destroyed
[03:21.900 --> 03:24.020]  because it exceeds the threshold.
[03:24.060 --> 03:26.940]  So that is one big objective that we have.
[03:26.940 --> 03:30.500]  And we want to emphasize that in these kind of outreach
[03:30.500 --> 03:33.380]  activities, right?
[03:33.380 --> 03:36.260]  So in the handout, you can see one of the tools
[03:36.260 --> 03:38.100]  that we use for quality assessment.
[03:38.100 --> 03:40.700]  And that is the use of the decoricator.
[03:40.700 --> 03:43.180]  In the back, you can see the machine that we use.
[03:43.180 --> 03:45.860]  This was a machine, thanks to Heather,
[03:45.860 --> 03:50.980]  from Lithuania that helped us decoricate all this material.
[03:50.980 --> 03:53.100]  Now, we talk about quality.
[03:53.100 --> 03:58.180]  Another important associated agricultural practice
[03:58.180 --> 04:00.500]  is the stand density.
[04:00.500 --> 04:04.140]  And that is that we need to ensure a high planting
[04:04.140 --> 04:08.140]  density to have a thin stem.
[04:08.140 --> 04:11.300]  Because it is believed that, or what we have seen actually,
[04:11.300 --> 04:14.460]  is that the lower the planting density,
[04:14.460 --> 04:18.180]  the higher the identification in the stem, which will in turn
[04:18.180 --> 04:22.380]  mean that you have more herd than bast in percentage, right?
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.900]  So why am I saying this?
[04:23.900 --> 04:27.740]  Well, the target planting density of this trial
[04:27.740 --> 04:30.980]  was 30 plants per square foot.
[04:30.980 --> 04:33.340]  However, after three weeks of planting,
[04:33.340 --> 04:38.980]  we noticed a strip of death, as I like to call it.
[04:38.980 --> 04:42.020]  A line perpendicular to the field was,
[04:42.020 --> 04:45.220]  after three weeks of planting, we
[04:45.220 --> 04:48.660]  observed that the plants were dying slowly and slowly.
[04:48.660 --> 04:51.820]  So what happened was that we applied this herbicide
[04:51.820 --> 04:54.900]  right after planting, primordial herbicide,
[04:54.900 --> 04:57.260]  and there was some overlapping in the middle.
[04:57.260 --> 05:00.100]  And when that happened, there was obviously
[05:00.100 --> 05:03.340]  double application of this herbicide,
[05:03.340 --> 05:07.020]  this herbicide whose active ingredient was pentamethalene.
[05:07.020 --> 05:09.300]  It inhibits cell division, right?
[05:09.300 --> 05:12.860]  So the symptoms of this are chlorosis, necrosis,
[05:12.860 --> 05:16.340]  reduction of the stem count, obviously, stunted growth.
[05:16.340 --> 05:18.860]  Larry's pointing out to that.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.820]  But in addition, the plants that survived
[05:20.820 --> 05:25.340]  had this bulbous symptom at the base of the stem.
[05:25.340 --> 05:28.780]  So that is actually one of the symptoms of the exposure
[05:28.780 --> 05:31.460]  to pentamethalene, which is the active ingredient of this
[05:31.460 --> 05:34.900]  herbicide that we sprayed.
[05:34.900 --> 05:37.020]  So there's something to keep in mind.
[05:37.020 --> 05:39.900]  One thing that we are realizing is that that herbicide might
[05:39.900 --> 05:44.140]  not be as good, because our stem count is going down.
[05:44.820 --> 05:48.740]  So we compensate for the poor seed quality, germination,
[05:48.740 --> 05:49.580]  you name it.
[05:49.580 --> 05:52.980]  But then in the field, we don't get that stem count.
[05:52.980 --> 05:54.820]  So we see that there is an extraneous factor
[05:54.820 --> 05:56.660]  that we were not considering and now we
[05:56.660 --> 05:59.660]  have to consider, which is the decimation of the stem
[05:59.660 --> 06:01.260]  count by this herbicide.
[06:06.220 --> 06:08.620]  OK, we're good.
[06:08.620 --> 06:11.740]  Yeah, so in addition to that, we are also
[06:11.740 --> 06:16.140]  testing the dual-purpose aspect of hemp, or grain,
[06:16.140 --> 06:17.860]  if you want to call it as well.
[06:17.860 --> 06:22.420]  So for that, we decreased the plant intensity.
[06:22.420 --> 06:26.340]  In this case, it was 12 plants per square foot.
[06:26.340 --> 06:27.820]  And that, you can see over there.
[06:27.820 --> 06:30.780]  However, George already mentioned this.
[06:30.780 --> 06:32.180]  June was too wet.
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.820]  We couldn't plant on time.
[06:33.820 --> 06:36.700]  And actually, that part of the field
[06:36.700 --> 06:40.220]  was planted about a month after this field.
[06:40.220 --> 06:42.100]  However, some of them are looking pretty good.
[06:42.100 --> 06:44.100]  And one thing that I will point out
[06:44.100 --> 06:47.940]  is that there is another cultivar that we developed
[06:47.940 --> 06:50.340]  in our program that is planted over there.
[06:50.340 --> 06:52.260]  And I am very happy to say that this
[06:52.260 --> 06:55.420]  is a cultivar that is thriving compared to the other ones.
[06:55.420 --> 07:00.460]  So one of the cultivars starts with a GVA letter system,
[07:00.460 --> 07:03.820]  and the other one will be the same letter system, right?
[07:03.820 --> 07:07.260]  They are actually on the north end of each plot.
[07:07.300 --> 07:10.620]  So please walk around, look at the plants.
[07:10.620 --> 07:11.700]  Don't kill them, please.
[07:11.700 --> 07:12.500]  I need to harvest.
[07:14.620 --> 07:18.460]  And please, if you have any questions.
[07:18.460 --> 07:19.260]  Yeah?
[07:19.260 --> 07:22.540]  For your seeding rate, why did you choose the, like,
[07:22.540 --> 07:24.940]  fiber typically is a heavier planting density,
[07:24.940 --> 07:28.860]  but why did you choose this heavy of a planting density?
[07:31.580 --> 07:32.220]  Yes.
[07:32.220 --> 07:34.620]  So the question was, why did I choose
[07:34.620 --> 07:36.420]  this heavy planting density?
[07:36.700 --> 07:42.220]  So for this, one thing that we were considering for this
[07:42.220 --> 07:43.820]  was the percentage of emergence.
[07:43.820 --> 07:45.980]  One thing is having germination in a paper towel,
[07:45.980 --> 07:48.460]  and quite another is having germination in the field.
[07:48.460 --> 07:51.740]  So we accounted for 70% emergence.
[07:51.740 --> 07:56.420]  This is an arbitrary number to have as much material
[07:56.420 --> 07:58.540]  in the field as possible.
[07:58.540 --> 08:00.180]  Obviously, some of that material may
[08:00.180 --> 08:01.580]  be lost due to self-thinning.
[08:01.580 --> 08:03.060]  If you guys are familiar with that,
[08:03.060 --> 08:04.860]  it's the plants, the cultivar itself
[08:04.900 --> 08:08.140]  will shade out all the plants, right?
[08:08.140 --> 08:10.700]  But the idea was to ensure as tight planting
[08:10.700 --> 08:13.500]  density as possible to have the greatest quality that we
[08:13.500 --> 08:14.500]  can get.
[08:14.500 --> 08:18.220]  So you can barely, I mean, because you have the labels,
[08:18.220 --> 08:19.700]  you can see which cultivar is which,
[08:19.700 --> 08:22.820]  but they are very tightly planted and very close
[08:22.820 --> 08:26.340]  to each other because we want to simulate a fiber production
[08:26.340 --> 08:29.420]  system that will be a larger scale.
[08:29.420 --> 08:31.820]  Any other questions?
[08:31.820 --> 08:33.420]  What field do you want to grow?
[08:34.300 --> 08:36.300]  What drill did you use?
[08:36.300 --> 08:36.900]  Great question.
[08:36.900 --> 08:38.900]  What drill did we use?
[08:38.900 --> 08:42.340]  We used a, Jamie, help me out.
[08:42.340 --> 08:49.180]  I think it was a 3.5 foot wide planter, right?
[08:49.180 --> 08:52.380]  And I don't want to call the in a row spacing.
[08:52.380 --> 08:53.220]  Was it 7 inch?
[08:53.220 --> 08:54.580]  Yeah, it was 7, 7 and 1 1.
[08:54.580 --> 08:56.540]  7 and 1 1 inch spacing in rows.
[08:56.540 --> 08:57.620]  It was a cone seeder.
[08:57.620 --> 08:59.020]  Oh, sorry, a cone seeder, yeah.
[08:59.020 --> 09:01.460]  So the cone seeder facilitated us
[09:01.460 --> 09:09.260]  to actually plant cultivar after cultivar in one pass.
[09:09.260 --> 09:10.100]  Any other questions?
[09:10.100 --> 09:11.380]  Talk about stem diameter?
[09:11.380 --> 09:18.940]  Yeah, so last year when we were planting a stick trial,
[09:18.940 --> 09:24.380]  I noticed a very interesting aspect of the fiber hemp
[09:24.380 --> 09:25.260]  cultivars.
[09:25.260 --> 09:27.100]  And that is that certain fiber cultivars
[09:27.100 --> 09:30.900]  when planted at lower densities were pretty much trees.
[09:30.940 --> 09:34.580]  They have a very wide stem diameter,
[09:34.580 --> 09:38.060]  while other cultivars, I think European cultivars,
[09:38.060 --> 09:41.460]  did not have such wide stem diameter.
[09:41.460 --> 09:44.700]  So here you can see a decent stem diameter.
[09:44.700 --> 09:49.140]  What is colloquially mentioned is a pencil thin stem
[09:49.140 --> 09:50.740]  for fiber, right?
[09:50.740 --> 09:52.340]  So this would be ideal.
[09:52.340 --> 09:54.500]  But it's also ideal because we planted it
[09:54.500 --> 09:57.500]  at very tight planting density.
[10:01.180 --> 10:05.180]  We did an analysis in regards to correlation of stem diameter
[10:05.180 --> 10:11.580]  with BAS, sorry, with what was it?
[10:11.580 --> 10:13.740]  Oh, stem count and stem diameter.
[10:13.740 --> 10:16.220]  So what we noticed is that for some cultivars,
[10:16.220 --> 10:18.860]  the stem count did affect the stem diameter.
[10:18.860 --> 10:21.780]  But for other cultivars, that wasn't so much the case.
[10:21.780 --> 10:24.660]  So there is some genotypic differences in the response
[10:24.660 --> 10:26.900]  to planting density, something that we can explore
[10:26.900 --> 10:30.260]  and we can definitely exploit.
[10:30.260 --> 10:40.020]  So if you're going to harvest fiber for textiles,
[10:40.020 --> 10:42.580]  this is the perfect size, pencil diameter.
[10:42.580 --> 10:44.300]  That's what they want.
[10:44.300 --> 10:48.220]  That's going to maximize your yield of high quality BAS
[10:48.220 --> 10:49.500]  fiber.
[10:49.500 --> 10:53.020]  But there are a lot of things we can do with hemp.
[10:53.020 --> 10:57.140]  You may be more interested in the herd for construction
[10:57.140 --> 11:02.180]  materials or to mix in to make a bioplastic mix.
[11:02.180 --> 11:04.620]  And in that case, you probably want
[11:04.620 --> 11:07.900]  to go for the big plants, the big diameter plants,
[11:07.900 --> 11:10.420]  because that's going to maximize your herd yield.
[11:10.420 --> 11:14.380]  But the BAS fiber yield will, BAS fiber quality
[11:14.380 --> 11:16.540]  will suffer in those plants.
[11:16.540 --> 11:20.020]  And you also have to be able to harvest it.
[11:20.020 --> 11:22.940]  So my colleagues at North Carolina State
[11:22.940 --> 11:26.180]  have been working a lot with the Chinese cultivars.
[11:26.180 --> 11:29.220]  Those tend to, when they are in, as Luis said,
[11:29.220 --> 11:32.540]  when they're planted in low density,
[11:32.540 --> 11:35.020]  you tend to get big stem diameters.
[11:35.020 --> 11:39.060]  And they got one inch, one and a half inch, even two inch
[11:39.060 --> 11:42.420]  diameter stems at the base, which
[11:42.420 --> 11:44.460]  choke the sickle bar more.
[11:44.460 --> 11:47.380]  So you have to be able to harvest it.
[11:47.380 --> 11:47.940]  Are you done?
[11:47.940 --> 11:49.420]  Are we moving on to Jamie?
[11:49.420 --> 11:51.140]  Sorry.
[11:51.140 --> 11:53.180]  How are you determining your harvesting timing?
[11:53.180 --> 11:54.940]  Because when you're talking about quality,
[11:54.940 --> 11:59.260]  if there's been decorticated harvest timing,
[11:59.260 --> 12:01.140]  how are you determining your harvesting time?
[12:01.140 --> 12:04.580]  So the question is, how do we determine harvest time?
[12:04.580 --> 12:09.180]  So just to add on to whatever Larry said,
[12:09.180 --> 12:12.380]  is that this diameter not only affects harvest, but also
[12:12.380 --> 12:13.740]  the decortication.
[12:13.740 --> 12:16.020]  Your decorticator may be clogged.
[12:16.020 --> 12:19.980]  You have a stem diameter that is wider than an inch.
[12:19.980 --> 12:22.300]  So it will be very difficult to remove the BAS.
[12:22.300 --> 12:23.460]  So just keep in mind.
[12:23.460 --> 12:26.820]  So the harvest time actually was based on flowering.
[12:26.820 --> 12:28.940]  So one interesting thing about flowering,
[12:28.940 --> 12:30.340]  I'm glad you asked this question,
[12:30.340 --> 12:32.820]  is that in some populations, actually
[12:32.820 --> 12:35.700]  population that we are going to harvest for the demo,
[12:35.700 --> 12:39.260]  we noticed that about 15% of those individuals flower,
[12:39.260 --> 12:41.980]  but that is stopped for like two weeks.
[12:41.980 --> 12:46.580]  So we can naively say, oh, let's harvest it
[12:46.580 --> 12:47.780]  because it's flowering.
[12:47.780 --> 12:49.020]  That's the optimal time point.
[12:49.020 --> 12:50.580]  After that, there is identification.
[12:50.580 --> 12:53.740]  But no entire plot was flowering.
[12:53.740 --> 12:56.140]  So what we are doing is estimating 50%
[12:56.140 --> 13:00.220]  of the individuals flowering for the harvest time.
[13:00.220 --> 13:02.980]  Once we reach that point, we can harvest the following week.
[13:02.980 --> 13:05.980]  So then we are sure that everything is flowering,
[13:05.980 --> 13:13.860]  and we can rule out segregation in the population.
[13:13.860 --> 13:16.940]  And with that, I would like to introduce you Jamie Crawford.
[13:16.940 --> 13:18.420]  Hello, everyone.
[13:18.420 --> 13:22.020]  So we've planned our very first plot trials for grain and fiber
[13:22.060 --> 13:23.260]  in 2017.
[13:23.260 --> 13:25.740]  So this is actually our sixth year.
[13:25.740 --> 13:28.860]  Sixth year, pretty exciting.
[13:28.860 --> 13:34.100]  And then for those trials, we harvested the plots
[13:34.100 --> 13:37.220]  with a small plot El Meco combine.
[13:37.220 --> 13:43.180]  In 2019, we started in collaboration
[13:43.180 --> 13:47.980]  with how many other universities are involved
[13:47.980 --> 13:50.140]  in the multi-state program.
[13:50.180 --> 13:52.940]  There are 14 other locations that
[13:52.940 --> 13:58.020]  are planting the exact same trial as you see down there.
[13:58.020 --> 14:01.780]  So you will see some cultivars that
[14:01.780 --> 14:04.940]  didn't do very well here that may be outstanding
[14:04.940 --> 14:06.780]  in other locations.
[14:06.780 --> 14:13.500]  So those are University of Vermont and Michigan State
[14:13.500 --> 14:15.820]  are some of the other northern locations.
[14:15.860 --> 14:20.780]  But then it's also at Louisiana State.
[14:20.780 --> 14:25.260]  So we've got a huge difference in latitudes
[14:25.260 --> 14:27.420]  for these cultivars.
[14:27.420 --> 14:32.420]  And so in 2019, we had a multi-state trial and a trial
[14:32.420 --> 14:34.500]  that we managed the way we always had.
[14:34.500 --> 14:36.940]  And we did that again in 2020.
[14:36.940 --> 14:42.100]  And throughout time, our trial methods became closer together.
[14:42.100 --> 14:44.220]  So now we just have the one trial
[14:44.220 --> 14:46.900]  that we're managing all in the same way.
[14:46.900 --> 14:50.700]  The big difference, I think, for the management
[14:50.700 --> 14:53.340]  is before we would use the plot combine,
[14:53.340 --> 14:56.420]  like I mentioned, for the grain harvest.
[14:56.420 --> 15:00.180]  But while it's a very excellent combine,
[15:00.180 --> 15:03.980]  the cutter bar is only able to go up to 2 and 1
[15:03.980 --> 15:06.580]  half to 3 feet from the ground.
[15:06.580 --> 15:09.260]  So we weren't really able to give people
[15:09.260 --> 15:13.980]  the dual-purpose information that they would like.
[15:14.220 --> 15:16.620]  Because even the super tall cultivars
[15:16.620 --> 15:20.940]  were cut off for grain at 2 and 1 half to 3 feet.
[15:20.940 --> 15:24.900]  So now everything is being harvested in quadrats.
[15:24.900 --> 15:29.220]  We'll be able to give everyone the fiber
[15:29.220 --> 15:33.140]  yields that they would like as well as the grain information.
[15:33.140 --> 15:36.980]  So we'll walk through those on the way to the next location.
[15:36.980 --> 15:41.060]  So please find me if you have any questions.
[15:41.100 --> 15:43.940]  Oh, I just want to mention there are
[15:43.940 --> 15:47.420]  some very excellent hemp cultivars that
[15:47.420 --> 15:52.260]  look terrible in the plots that we were going past.
[15:52.260 --> 15:56.260]  So that is, yeah.
[15:56.260 --> 15:58.660]  So the current conditions that you see here
[15:58.660 --> 16:02.420]  are not representative of the potential of those cultivars.
[16:02.420 --> 16:03.860]  I want to make that very clear.
[16:08.060 --> 16:10.500]  I think it was a combination of the weather
[16:10.500 --> 16:13.620]  being planted the end of June.
[16:13.620 --> 16:17.380]  The herbicide may have had an impact.
[16:17.380 --> 16:20.980]  There were a few of them that were marginal seed
[16:20.980 --> 16:23.100]  lots to begin with.
[16:23.100 --> 16:26.620]  And so Lynn mentioned this morning,
[16:26.620 --> 16:31.380]  if you were in on her talk, that if the seed lot wasn't
[16:31.380 --> 16:33.580]  great to start, then it was way more
[16:33.580 --> 16:35.780]  susceptible to any of the herbicides.
[16:35.780 --> 16:40.420]  So I think that may have played a role in it.
[16:40.420 --> 16:42.900]  And at this hemp meeting last year,
[16:42.900 --> 16:47.900]  I recommended anyone growing for grain or fiber
[16:47.900 --> 16:51.780]  to do their own germ test.
[16:51.780 --> 16:54.220]  And so I've set up some ragdoll tests
[16:54.220 --> 16:59.220]  to show you what you should see after two days in a germ test.
[16:59.220 --> 17:03.940]  And these were just in a Ziploc bag in a sunny window.
[17:03.940 --> 17:06.540]  So it got an alternating warm and cool temperature
[17:06.540 --> 17:07.580]  in the night.
[17:07.580 --> 17:10.100]  And so at the far end of this field,
[17:10.260 --> 17:12.140]  I have those set up so you can look.
[17:12.140 --> 17:16.580]  And if you find that your seed lot looks
[17:16.580 --> 17:20.660]  a lot like the bad one, then I implore
[17:20.660 --> 17:23.620]  you reach out to your seed provider
[17:23.620 --> 17:25.060]  so they can make it right.
[17:25.060 --> 17:27.340]  You do not want to put that in the ground.
[17:27.340 --> 17:29.980]  Because even if you have something
[17:29.980 --> 17:34.460]  with 40% germination, it's got other issues
[17:34.460 --> 17:35.860]  than just low germination.
[17:35.860 --> 17:39.220]  You cannot increase that seeding rate enough
[17:39.260 --> 17:41.460]  to make up for that low germ.
[17:41.460 --> 17:42.980]  And so, yeah.
[17:42.980 --> 17:45.980]  So are there any questions before we start walking?
[17:48.460 --> 17:49.460]  Sorry.
[17:49.460 --> 17:52.020]  Can you just explain to the uninitiated
[17:52.020 --> 17:54.940]  the ideal way of harvesting a dual purpose plant
[17:54.940 --> 17:57.420]  so that you're maximizing the yield of both?
[18:00.860 --> 18:06.540]  Well, if you'd want to harvest it when it's at about 75%,
[18:06.620 --> 18:08.580]  the grain is, hmm?
[18:08.580 --> 18:09.980]  Did I turn it off?
[18:09.980 --> 18:12.980]  When the grain is about 75% mature.
[18:12.980 --> 18:16.780]  And I didn't think I pushed any buttons.
[18:18.300 --> 18:20.500]  When the grain's about 75% mature
[18:20.500 --> 18:25.420]  and you want to raise the cutter bar up as high as you can
[18:25.420 --> 18:29.260]  so you can leave both for the sake of your combine,
[18:29.260 --> 18:33.500]  which you don't want to have all that material
[18:33.500 --> 18:35.740]  wrapping around inside.
[18:35.780 --> 18:39.540]  And for the amount of fiber that you can leave behind,
[18:39.540 --> 18:42.140]  you want that cutter bar up as high as you can
[18:42.140 --> 18:44.660]  to just take the seed heads off.
[18:44.660 --> 18:45.500]  Okay.
[18:45.500 --> 18:46.340]  Is that good?
[18:47.900 --> 18:49.540]  Can I add on to that now?
[18:49.540 --> 18:50.460]  Yes, please.
[18:54.140 --> 18:55.340]  So there are a couple of ways
[18:55.340 --> 18:57.700]  that you can do a dual purpose harvest.
[18:57.700 --> 19:00.740]  We have a stripper header from Formation Ag,
[19:00.740 --> 19:03.100]  which they call a clean strip, I believe,
[19:03.940 --> 19:06.220]  that we have mounted on the front of a tractor
[19:06.220 --> 19:07.700]  where the bucket is.
[19:07.700 --> 19:12.700]  So we can raise that stripper header up six, seven feet high
[19:12.700 --> 19:14.060]  you can drive through the field
[19:14.060 --> 19:17.340]  and then capture all of the grain from the grain heads.
[19:18.180 --> 19:20.020]  And then we have followed behind that
[19:20.020 --> 19:21.140]  with a sickle bar mower
[19:22.060 --> 19:27.060]  and laid the straw down right behind the stripper header.
[19:27.420 --> 19:28.460]  So that's one way.
[19:28.460 --> 19:30.460]  It's a two tractor operation then.
[19:31.460 --> 19:33.900]  You have to be conscious of the direction that you're going.
[19:33.900 --> 19:36.380]  So the sickle bar actually is gonna come back
[19:36.380 --> 19:39.460]  the opposite way that you went with the stripper header
[19:39.460 --> 19:41.620]  because the stripper header has sort of
[19:41.620 --> 19:42.980]  leaned the stems over.
[19:44.220 --> 19:46.620]  So we did that last year in some strip trials
[19:46.620 --> 19:47.780]  that worked quite well.
[19:48.780 --> 19:51.220]  That stripper header is then offloading
[19:51.220 --> 19:54.300]  into a wagon you've got adjacent.
[19:54.300 --> 19:57.620]  The other way is to use a dedicated dual purpose harvester.
[19:57.620 --> 20:01.060]  There's a machine that is a modified John Deere combine
[20:01.060 --> 20:04.140]  called built by the company Hempflax.
[20:04.140 --> 20:07.100]  We have one of those Hempflax harvesters here in New York.
[20:07.100 --> 20:09.060]  It was brought here by Canopy Growth
[20:09.060 --> 20:11.360]  as a part of their project a few years ago.
[20:12.820 --> 20:16.900]  If you're interested in doing dual purpose hemp harvest
[20:16.900 --> 20:18.140]  please come see me
[20:18.140 --> 20:20.700]  because we are trying to retain that machine
[20:20.700 --> 20:25.120]  here in New York to stimulate the hemp industry in New York
[20:25.120 --> 20:28.680]  and would like to identify people who can commit
[20:28.680 --> 20:31.720]  to using that Hempflax harvester in the future
[20:32.640 --> 20:35.760]  so that we can make a business plan to retain it here.
[20:36.680 --> 20:39.440]  The plan right now would be it would be housed here
[20:39.440 --> 20:40.680]  at Cornell Agritech,
[20:41.560 --> 20:44.320]  but it would be rented out on an hourly basis
[20:46.320 --> 20:49.620]  so that the owners can recover the cost of that machine.
[20:50.620 --> 20:58.170]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[20:58.170 --> 21:00.770]  on the web at cornell.edu.
