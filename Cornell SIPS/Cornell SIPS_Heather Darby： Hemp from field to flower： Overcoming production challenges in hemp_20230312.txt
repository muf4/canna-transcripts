[00:00.000 --> 00:09.510]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:09.510 --> 00:10.870]  Hi, everyone.
[00:10.870 --> 00:13.790]  Welcome to the Webinar Series.
[00:13.790 --> 00:15.230]  My name is Luis Monterrate.
[00:15.230 --> 00:18.350]  I'm a second year PhD student in plant building and genetics
[00:18.350 --> 00:20.830]  at Cornell University in Marist-Mars Lab.
[00:20.830 --> 00:24.150]  And once again, I'm accompanied by Cornell alum Tony,
[00:24.150 --> 00:26.470]  sorry, Baracco, who has assisted me
[00:26.470 --> 00:31.030]  with this webinar in this past, what is it going to be,
[00:31.030 --> 00:34.510]  like four sessions by now.
[00:34.510 --> 00:38.870]  I would like to mention again that this webinar series is
[00:38.870 --> 00:42.150]  accompanied of a larger project called a, well,
[00:42.150 --> 00:45.110]  which is a development of a educational curriculum
[00:45.110 --> 00:49.070]  or module, sorry, that will be available on the Cornell HEM
[00:49.070 --> 00:52.270]  website at the end of the webinar series.
[00:52.270 --> 00:55.110]  And each module, excuse me, each module
[00:55.110 --> 00:57.870]  will consist of a recorded webinar, an instructional slide
[00:57.870 --> 00:59.750]  deck, and a set of high impact papers
[00:59.750 --> 01:02.350]  pertaining to the respective subject.
[01:02.350 --> 01:05.950]  All webinars will be recorded and available on the Cornell
[01:05.950 --> 01:07.990]  SIPS YouTube channel.
[01:07.990 --> 01:10.110]  If you're interested in watching them or sharing them
[01:10.110 --> 01:11.790]  with somebody else.
[01:11.790 --> 01:15.430]  So with that, I'd like to introduce Dr. Heather Darby.
[01:15.430 --> 01:18.950]  She's a professor of agronomy at the University of Vermont.
[01:18.950 --> 01:23.630]  And she has hosted a very nice hemp conference two weeks ago.
[01:23.630 --> 01:26.750]  And today, she's going to talk about her experiences growing
[01:26.750 --> 01:29.510]  high-cannabinoid hemp in the Northeastern US.
[01:29.550 --> 01:32.390]  So great to hear about this and to hear more about it.
[01:32.390 --> 01:36.750]  So without further ado, please Dr. Darby, take it away.
[01:36.750 --> 01:37.670]  All right.
[01:37.670 --> 01:38.190]  Well, great.
[01:38.190 --> 01:42.470]  Thanks, everyone, for joining today.
[01:42.470 --> 01:49.790]  And as already mentioned, I've been working on hemp
[01:49.790 --> 01:53.590]  here in Vermont, which is in the Northeastern part of the United
[01:53.590 --> 01:54.150]  States.
[01:54.150 --> 01:56.950]  If you're not familiar where Vermont is,
[01:56.950 --> 01:59.470]  it's actually right next to New York.
[01:59.470 --> 02:03.430]  And it's a small state, but very beautiful.
[02:03.430 --> 02:10.670]  And we have been able to research hemp since 2015,
[02:10.670 --> 02:14.750]  once we were able to receive a permit from the US government.
[02:14.750 --> 02:20.750]  So our research has been sort of developing over that time.
[02:20.750 --> 02:25.830]  And I'll also say part of what we do at the University
[02:25.830 --> 02:28.670]  of Vermont is also work with growers.
[02:28.710 --> 02:31.390]  So we're not only conducting research,
[02:31.390 --> 02:33.950]  but the research that we do, we want
[02:33.950 --> 02:37.150]  it to be very applied and practical and readily
[02:37.150 --> 02:40.790]  available to the farmers that we're trying to help.
[02:40.790 --> 02:45.630]  So for most people that are growing hemp, it is a new crop.
[02:45.630 --> 02:49.070]  And it's also been really a new crop to researchers.
[02:49.070 --> 02:52.230]  So there's quite a bit to learn.
[02:52.230 --> 02:56.390]  I've learned a lot myself over the past six years
[02:56.390 --> 02:57.830]  now that we've been doing this.
[02:57.910 --> 03:00.950]  And I just want to share some of that with you today,
[03:00.950 --> 03:05.390]  just experiences and also research.
[03:05.390 --> 03:09.110]  OK, so let's start with soil.
[03:09.110 --> 03:12.230]  So if you're growing outside, of course, and even if you're not,
[03:12.230 --> 03:16.070]  if you're growing inside the growing media
[03:16.070 --> 03:19.110]  or if you're outside, of course, the soil
[03:19.110 --> 03:21.910]  is obviously where we need to start.
[03:21.910 --> 03:24.510]  It's going to really, in a lot of ways,
[03:24.510 --> 03:30.990]  make or break the overall productivity of your operation.
[03:30.990 --> 03:34.710]  So if you're buying a farm, buying land,
[03:34.710 --> 03:36.070]  it's definitely something you want
[03:36.070 --> 03:40.510]  to pay a lot of attention to if you don't own land yet.
[03:40.510 --> 03:42.870]  But if you own land, you really want
[03:42.870 --> 03:50.110]  to focus on what you have and really make the soil
[03:50.150 --> 03:56.070]  so that it is highly conducive for adequate crop production.
[03:56.070 --> 03:58.230]  So we hear a lot about hemp being
[03:58.230 --> 04:03.230]  widely adapted to many climates, which is really true.
[04:03.230 --> 04:09.390]  But in regards to soil, it does require the highest, really
[04:09.390 --> 04:11.950]  the highest quality soil for the plant
[04:11.950 --> 04:14.190]  to be the most productive.
[04:14.190 --> 04:18.790]  So a soil that has really good physical properties
[04:18.790 --> 04:21.350]  and good soil health, and I'll explain a little bit more
[04:21.350 --> 04:23.150]  about this.
[04:23.150 --> 04:28.710]  Now, one of the primary sort of limitations
[04:28.710 --> 04:32.430]  that I've seen in growing hemp is that hemp doesn't really
[04:32.430 --> 04:36.830]  like wet feet, especially when it's small,
[04:36.830 --> 04:39.550]  when you first plant it, or if you're
[04:39.550 --> 04:41.830]  transplanting when you first put those transplants
[04:41.830 --> 04:42.750]  in the ground.
[04:42.750 --> 04:44.950]  Once it's established, it can definitely
[04:44.950 --> 04:47.830]  tolerate wetter soils.
[04:47.830 --> 04:50.990]  But in its initial phases of establishment,
[04:50.990 --> 04:54.350]  it's really difficult to get a good stand of hemp
[04:54.350 --> 04:58.950]  if you have very, very wet soils and poorly drained soils.
[04:58.950 --> 05:03.870]  Generally, we find that if you have 40% or more clay content
[05:03.870 --> 05:05.990]  in your soil, it's going to be difficult probably
[05:05.990 --> 05:08.190]  to grow most any crop.
[05:08.190 --> 05:12.630]  But why would we do that?
[05:12.630 --> 05:16.470]  But it's especially difficult to get hemp established.
[05:16.470 --> 05:20.070]  And of course, there are a lot of opportunities
[05:20.070 --> 05:22.590]  if you have clay soil to basically create
[05:22.590 --> 05:25.870]  better structure and drainage, and also possibly
[05:25.870 --> 05:29.190]  to use subsurface drainage or tile
[05:29.190 --> 05:32.030]  to assist with creating an environment that will be
[05:32.030 --> 05:34.190]  conducive for hemp production.
[05:34.190 --> 05:38.190]  And I'll say the other piece here is, I guess,
[05:38.190 --> 05:39.870]  take a soil test.
[05:39.870 --> 05:42.670]  If you're going to call a university system
[05:42.670 --> 05:46.910]  and ask an extension person what you should do to your soil,
[05:46.910 --> 05:49.030]  probably the first thing they're going to say to you
[05:49.030 --> 05:51.270]  is, do you have a soil test?
[05:51.270 --> 05:53.270]  So get out and take a soil test.
[05:53.270 --> 05:56.230]  A standard soil test is cheap.
[05:56.230 --> 06:01.390]  Usually, they cost anywhere from $15 to maybe $20 or $25.
[06:01.390 --> 06:07.070]  Most university systems will provide soil test services
[06:07.070 --> 06:09.070]  in New York.
[06:09.070 --> 06:11.070]  That's through a private lab in Vermont.
[06:11.070 --> 06:13.230]  It's through the university.
[06:13.230 --> 06:16.390]  So contact your university extension
[06:16.390 --> 06:19.710]  to figure that out where you would send those.
[06:19.710 --> 06:24.590]  But it's worth the $15 or $20 so that you
[06:24.590 --> 06:28.430]  can address any underlying issues, especially
[06:28.430 --> 06:32.390]  from a fertility perspective that the soil might be.
[06:32.390 --> 06:35.590]  So pH is probably the first thing to look at.
[06:35.590 --> 06:39.630]  And hemp does require a pH over 6,
[06:39.630 --> 06:43.630]  and at least in the Northeast and other parts of the world
[06:43.630 --> 06:49.790]  as well, the soil pH generally either is below 7
[06:49.790 --> 06:51.590]  and sometimes well below, like it
[06:51.590 --> 06:53.390]  can be here in the Northeast.
[06:53.390 --> 06:56.310]  And then in other parts of the country or the world,
[06:56.310 --> 07:01.110]  sometimes the pH is well over 7, sometimes 8.
[07:01.110 --> 07:05.430]  And both ends of that spectrum can create some productivity
[07:05.470 --> 07:06.470]  issues.
[07:06.470 --> 07:10.350]  So again, you want to try to adjust that soil pH to be right
[07:10.350 --> 07:16.590]  around or over 6, so ideally about 6.5 to 6.8,
[07:16.590 --> 07:20.270]  so slightly acidic.
[07:20.270 --> 07:21.750]  All right, there we go.
[07:21.750 --> 07:25.950]  So fertility requirements of hemp are known.
[07:25.950 --> 07:29.630]  So we know what hemp has in its plant composition.
[07:29.630 --> 07:31.670]  If we took the plant and ground it up,
[07:31.670 --> 07:34.750]  we would see what nutrients are in it
[07:34.750 --> 07:37.390]  and what the composition is.
[07:37.390 --> 07:41.270]  And what we know less about for growing hemp at this point
[07:41.270 --> 07:49.590]  are nutrient requirements based on each individual's soil type
[07:49.590 --> 07:50.590]  or climate.
[07:50.590 --> 07:54.710]  And that type of information takes years to develop.
[07:54.710 --> 07:58.150]  And because we've only had a short period of time,
[07:58.150 --> 08:00.310]  at least at the university system,
[08:00.310 --> 08:04.070]  growing hemp in the last 50 to 100 years,
[08:04.070 --> 08:07.390]  we don't have the best soil recommendations
[08:07.390 --> 08:09.750]  we could have like we do for other crops.
[08:09.750 --> 08:16.390]  But we do have, I would say, well-educated guesses
[08:16.390 --> 08:20.550]  around what we feel people need to be doing to grow
[08:20.550 --> 08:23.270]  a high-quality stand of hemp.
[08:23.270 --> 08:29.030]  So we know that hemp requires, in good amounts, nitrogen,
[08:29.030 --> 08:30.390]  potassium, and phosphorus.
[08:30.390 --> 08:32.510]  These are the macronutrients.
[08:32.550 --> 08:35.350]  So we know that hemp is generally
[08:35.350 --> 08:38.870]  composed of about 3% to 4% nitrogen.
[08:38.870 --> 08:43.350]  So it utilizes a lot of nitrogen, just like most crops.
[08:43.350 --> 08:45.390]  2% to 3% potassium.
[08:45.390 --> 08:49.670]  So again, it requires high levels of potassium.
[08:49.670 --> 08:55.830]  And for phosphorus, it requires much less to grow adequately.
[08:55.830 --> 09:01.310]  And it's about a half a percent to about 0.6%.
[09:01.350 --> 09:04.830]  So if you look at these ratios, you
[09:04.830 --> 09:08.670]  can see that that crop is going to require far more nitrogen
[09:08.670 --> 09:12.230]  and potassium than it will phosphorus.
[09:12.230 --> 09:15.670]  So in general, at least in Vermont,
[09:15.670 --> 09:20.310]  for potassium and phosphorus, based on our soil tests
[09:20.310 --> 09:23.110]  that we've received from hemp growers,
[09:23.110 --> 09:29.470]  we're usually looking at about a 60 to 70 pound recommendation
[09:29.470 --> 09:32.950]  per acre for both potassium and phosphorus.
[09:32.950 --> 09:37.190]  But again, that's highly dependent on a soil test.
[09:37.190 --> 09:40.430]  So we want to account for what's already in your soil
[09:40.430 --> 09:43.870]  before we tell you to put on more nutrients.
[09:43.870 --> 09:46.430]  But again, you can see, in general,
[09:46.430 --> 09:50.150]  your crop is going to require a lot of nitrogen,
[09:50.150 --> 09:53.270]  a good amount of potassium, and a much smaller amount
[09:53.270 --> 09:54.710]  of phosphorus.
[09:54.710 --> 09:57.870]  It's really important for folks to understand
[09:57.870 --> 10:02.670]  that there are essential nutrients to growing crops.
[10:02.670 --> 10:05.750]  And even though we call these macronutrients
[10:05.750 --> 10:09.510]  and you need them in relatively higher percentages,
[10:09.510 --> 10:14.230]  it doesn't mean that adding nitrogen and not adding
[10:14.230 --> 10:16.750]  phosphorus is what you should do.
[10:16.750 --> 10:19.310]  If your soil test comes back saying
[10:19.310 --> 10:22.910]  that you're low in phosphorus and you're
[10:22.910 --> 10:26.030]  high in potassium and nitrogen, but you
[10:26.030 --> 10:28.150]  don't add the phosphorus, you're
[10:28.150 --> 10:33.150]  still going to have production limitations in both quality
[10:33.150 --> 10:34.750]  and also yield.
[10:34.750 --> 10:37.270]  So it's important to take that soil test
[10:37.270 --> 10:42.510]  and understand the baseline fertility of the soil
[10:42.510 --> 10:44.870]  before you just start adding things.
[10:44.870 --> 10:48.310]  Because adding too much nutrients or not enough
[10:48.310 --> 10:56.580]  can cause a lot of challenges as the crop is growing.
[10:56.580 --> 10:57.060]  All right.
[10:57.060 --> 11:01.780]  So there's a lot of information about nitrogen, fertility,
[11:01.780 --> 11:06.780]  and hemp in the gray literature, I guess.
[11:06.780 --> 11:11.780]  So we do see a lot of information out there.
[11:11.780 --> 11:15.300]  And it's kind of hard to sort through what's
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.780]  been scientifically researched and what hasn't.
[11:18.780 --> 11:21.660]  But from my own experiences working
[11:21.660 --> 11:24.580]  with farmers and the research that we've done,
[11:24.660 --> 11:29.260]  we have seen, and this also is supported in the literature,
[11:29.260 --> 11:34.500]  that if you put on too much nitrogen, too high a rates,
[11:34.500 --> 11:37.380]  it does stimulate the formation of male flowers.
[11:37.380 --> 11:42.660]  And I haven't seen this in hemp being grown for CBD or even
[11:42.660 --> 11:43.300]  THC.
[11:43.300 --> 11:47.140]  Where I've seen this is in grain hemp,
[11:47.140 --> 11:51.620]  actually, where I've seen a lot of hermaphrodites
[11:51.620 --> 11:54.660]  being produced when we've done nitrogen studies
[11:54.660 --> 11:59.140]  and put on rates that are well over 200 pounds of nitrogen
[11:59.140 --> 12:00.340]  per acre.
[12:00.340 --> 12:04.300]  So again, too much nitrogen can lead to other problems.
[12:04.300 --> 12:07.660]  Split applications of nitrogen are the best.
[12:07.660 --> 12:10.380]  That is going to minimize overfeeding
[12:10.380 --> 12:13.860]  at any one single stage, but also
[12:13.860 --> 12:17.140]  minimize the potential for loss.
[12:17.140 --> 12:21.580]  So if you put all that nitrogen fertility on before you even
[12:21.620 --> 12:25.340]  plant, it's at risk of loss into the environment.
[12:25.340 --> 12:31.020]  And fertilizers are expensive, so we don't want to do that.
[12:31.020 --> 12:35.340]  All right, so deficiency of nitrogen in hemp
[12:35.340 --> 12:39.340]  causes the entire plant to turn yellow and look very chlorotic.
[12:39.340 --> 12:44.780]  And it's really hard to bring those plants back, I have found.
[12:44.780 --> 12:50.260]  So really have your fertility strategy honed in and ready
[12:50.300 --> 12:54.420]  to go before you put the plants in the ground,
[12:54.420 --> 12:58.380]  because once those plants get really stressed,
[12:58.380 --> 13:02.180]  it feels often impossible to bring them back.
[13:02.180 --> 13:10.140]  All right, so how much nitrogen are we talking about?
[13:10.140 --> 13:12.740]  And we have done some studies here
[13:12.740 --> 13:18.180]  in Vermont in collaboration with the University of Maine as well.
[13:18.220 --> 13:24.780]  And really what we have found is that fertilizing hemp being
[13:24.780 --> 13:33.100]  grown for CBD or flour or cannabinoids
[13:33.100 --> 13:39.420]  really does require about anywhere from 100
[13:39.420 --> 13:43.020]  up to about 125 pounds of nitrogen.
[13:43.020 --> 13:48.420]  So what that means is that the plant is going
[13:48.420 --> 13:53.820]  to take up that much nitrogen. That does not necessarily
[13:53.820 --> 13:59.700]  mean that you need to apply that much nitrogen to the soil.
[13:59.700 --> 14:04.060]  So here, this is showing percent nitrogen concentration.
[14:04.060 --> 14:08.420]  And you can see at 125 pounds of nitrogen,
[14:08.420 --> 14:15.140]  we maxed out the percent of N in the actual plant.
[14:15.140 --> 14:17.420]  And that's what we're really trying to understand,
[14:17.420 --> 14:21.860]  because we know that the hemp is only really going to take up
[14:21.860 --> 14:27.060]  3% to 4% of its total biomass in nitrogen.
[14:27.060 --> 14:30.300]  So we're trying to figure out when does that plateau?
[14:30.300 --> 14:34.740]  How much do we actually need to add to supply
[14:34.740 --> 14:37.700]  the plant with what it needs?
[14:37.700 --> 14:43.820]  So this is our nitrogen research results from this year in Vermont.
[14:43.820 --> 14:48.980]  And you can see we applied zero pounds of nitrogen,
[14:48.980 --> 14:55.340]  50 pounds of nitrogen, 100, 150, and 200.
[14:55.340 --> 14:58.180]  And these were split applications.
[14:58.180 --> 15:01.660]  So we didn't apply it all at once, like I already mentioned.
[15:01.660 --> 15:06.260]  We split these up over three times, part of the nitrogen
[15:06.260 --> 15:11.060]  going on before we planted, part of the nitrogen going on
[15:11.060 --> 15:15.980]  about two weeks after we planted, and an additional amount of nitrogen
[15:15.980 --> 15:20.780]  going on about four to five weeks after we planted.
[15:20.780 --> 15:28.260]  And you can see that when we hit about 100 pounds of nitrogen added,
[15:28.300 --> 15:36.300]  we maximized flower yield at a little over four pounds per plant.
[15:36.300 --> 15:41.460]  But we also, if you look at this orange line,
[15:41.460 --> 15:48.700]  the percentage of flower out of the whole total biomass went down,
[15:48.700 --> 15:52.580]  which is really interesting, which means the plant is actually
[15:52.620 --> 15:58.700]  also producing a lot more leaves and stems.
[15:58.700 --> 16:03.620]  So it's taking that nitrogen and it's building biomass.
[16:03.620 --> 16:08.380]  And some of that biomass is flower, but some of the biomass
[16:08.380 --> 16:14.260]  that's being produced is also more leaves, more stems, et cetera.
[16:14.260 --> 16:18.620]  But again, as I mentioned, really this about 100,
[16:18.620 --> 16:26.340]  anywhere between 100 and about 125 is where we're seeing a maximum response.
[16:26.340 --> 16:33.300]  And again, you know, this is, it's complicated because it really is
[16:33.300 --> 16:40.980]  dependent on how you've treated your soil in the past to determine
[16:40.980 --> 16:45.220]  how much additional nitrogen you need to add.
[16:45.220 --> 16:49.420]  But in general, if you're starting really at ground zero,
[16:49.420 --> 16:53.580]  this is what we're finding as optimum.
[16:53.580 --> 16:58.820]  All right, so, you know, there's been a lot of question as well around
[16:58.820 --> 17:06.220]  if we increase nitrogen rates, are we going to see spikes in THC and CBD?
[17:06.220 --> 17:10.180]  And this, there's a lot of, has been a lot of debate about this in,
[17:10.220 --> 17:15.860]  again, in the gray literature where, you know, you hear a lot about
[17:15.860 --> 17:21.060]  if you add too much nitrogen, the THC levels are going to go up.
[17:21.060 --> 17:25.420]  And if you don't add enough, the THC levels are going to go up.
[17:25.420 --> 17:28.260]  We have not experienced that.
[17:28.260 --> 17:34.740]  We have been conducting these studies now since 2018,
[17:34.780 --> 17:42.140]  looking at fertility rates in hemp being grown for cannabinoids.
[17:42.140 --> 17:47.740]  And, you know, up to about 200 pounds of nitrogen being applied,
[17:47.740 --> 17:53.220]  we have not seen a spike in THC, which is what this data is showing,
[17:53.220 --> 17:54.780]  this lower bar.
[17:54.780 --> 17:59.780]  You can see that there's no, there has been no difference.
[17:59.780 --> 18:05.980]  We also really haven't seen a difference in total cannabinoids either.
[18:10.300 --> 18:14.980]  So, fertility, very important.
[18:14.980 --> 18:16.820]  Start with a soil test.
[18:16.820 --> 18:19.940]  If you don't know how to read it, reach out to somebody,
[18:19.940 --> 18:22.100]  usually at the university system.
[18:22.100 --> 18:25.300]  There's also lots of private crop consultants.
[18:25.300 --> 18:27.700]  There is information on the internet too,
[18:27.700 --> 18:30.660]  but make sure you're going to a reputable source.
[18:30.660 --> 18:34.100]  We have a website, Cornell has a website,
[18:34.100 --> 18:39.580]  so that you're making good decisions around fertility management.
[18:39.580 --> 18:40.940]  Here's a picture of some hemp.
[18:40.940 --> 18:43.140]  Doesn't look so great.
[18:43.140 --> 18:48.020]  This hemp here is actually stressed out from its soil condition.
[18:48.020 --> 18:52.860]  And again, when you're growing hemp, if it's starting out like this,
[18:52.860 --> 18:57.580]  it becomes very difficult to get it back on track.
[18:57.580 --> 19:01.060]  So, starting out by doing your homework,
[19:01.060 --> 19:03.700]  you know, preparing the land properly,
[19:03.700 --> 19:09.580]  it's going to go a long way into success on your farm.
[19:09.580 --> 19:14.180]  So, hemp does have a relatively long tap root.
[19:14.180 --> 19:19.820]  If the soil is friable, can go up to six feet down into the ground,
[19:19.820 --> 19:23.580]  especially if you have really good soil quality that I mentioned before.
[19:23.780 --> 19:29.180]  So, the soil is very friable, maybe even if the lighter textured soil.
[19:29.180 --> 19:36.260]  But soil condition does really impact the depth and rooting system of hemp.
[19:36.260 --> 19:38.580]  It does in other crops too.
[19:38.580 --> 19:44.020]  But hemp can be very efficient at securing nutrients,
[19:44.020 --> 19:47.380]  especially deeper down into the soil profile,
[19:47.380 --> 19:52.980]  if you create a good soil environment.
[19:53.980 --> 19:58.940]  It also allows the plant to access water,
[19:58.940 --> 20:05.860]  which it may not be able to otherwise access if the rooting system is really shallow.
[20:05.860 --> 20:09.980]  So again, just giving the hemp a really great soil environment
[20:09.980 --> 20:13.820]  will help the plant become more productive.
[20:13.820 --> 20:18.340]  All right, I have a feeling this is just going to end up being a soil talk,
[20:18.340 --> 20:21.580]  which is important, as I've already said.
[20:21.620 --> 20:23.340]  And there's a lot to say about it.
[20:23.340 --> 20:28.580]  So, we'll keep going down this line, I'm sure.
[20:28.580 --> 20:30.580]  There'll be a lot of questions as well.
[20:30.580 --> 20:34.780]  So again, there's potassium and phosphorus as well.
[20:34.780 --> 20:40.100]  Needing a little bit less, but still really important nutrients.
[20:40.100 --> 20:46.060]  We do know that hemp uses most of its phosphorus at flowering,
[20:46.060 --> 20:50.020]  so more so than during the vegetative phase.
[20:50.020 --> 20:56.020]  So you want to make sure that the phosphorus itself is added,
[20:56.020 --> 20:58.740]  not necessarily at flowering.
[20:58.740 --> 21:02.780]  I would actually say that adding phosphorus earlier,
[21:02.780 --> 21:06.420]  like even pre-plant, works out really well,
[21:06.420 --> 21:11.420]  because you don't necessarily lose phosphorus from leaching in the soil.
[21:11.420 --> 21:13.500]  And depending on the source of phosphorus,
[21:13.500 --> 21:18.460]  it might take a little bit for it to break down or make its way to the plant.
[21:18.500 --> 21:23.500]  So you just want to make sure that that phosphorus is available at flowering.
[21:23.500 --> 21:27.500]  Make sure the pH, again, is over six,
[21:27.500 --> 21:31.060]  because if you have a really low or really high pH,
[21:31.060 --> 21:34.820]  it actually will tie up phosphorus.
[21:34.820 --> 21:35.780]  Okay?
[21:35.780 --> 21:39.460]  So again, most of the phosphorus is used during flowering,
[21:39.460 --> 21:44.740]  and you'll want to make sure that you get that on early enough in the season
[21:44.780 --> 21:49.140]  so that it is available to the plant at that time.
[21:49.140 --> 21:54.420]  If you're looking at your soil tests, usually soil tests will say,
[21:54.420 --> 21:59.180]  you know, if the amount of phosphorus or potassium, let's say,
[21:59.180 --> 22:04.900]  is adequate or optimum, and that's really your indicator
[22:04.900 --> 22:09.260]  if you don't know much about soil tests and soil test reports,
[22:09.260 --> 22:10.580]  that you have enough.
[22:10.580 --> 22:10.940]  Okay?
[22:10.980 --> 22:16.940]  So if you're optimum in phosphorus on the soil tests or even high,
[22:16.940 --> 22:20.620]  you definitely don't have to add any more.
[22:20.620 --> 22:25.180]  Okay, so with potassium, you need to be a little bit careful with potassium.
[22:25.180 --> 22:27.180]  It's very soluble.
[22:27.180 --> 22:28.700]  It's readily available.
[22:28.700 --> 22:32.700]  It also can leach very easily.
[22:32.700 --> 22:39.220]  And the requirement of hemp for potassium is highest.
[22:39.500 --> 22:42.140]  About four weeks after germination.
[22:42.140 --> 22:50.380]  So kind of in that where we start to move into kind of the rapid growth phase of hemp.
[22:50.380 --> 22:59.020]  And you, again, would want to put the potassium on relatively early.
[22:59.020 --> 23:04.140]  If you need a lot of it, you might want to do like a split application,
[23:04.180 --> 23:09.900]  and a lot means you need 100 pounds or even 150 pounds.
[23:09.900 --> 23:12.820]  It really will depend on your soil test.
[23:12.820 --> 23:16.940]  You'll want to do a split application a little bit, about half, I guess,
[23:16.940 --> 23:21.220]  a little bit half at planting, and then, you know, the other half,
[23:21.220 --> 23:23.740]  a couple of weeks after planting.
[23:23.740 --> 23:27.900]  But you really want to make sure that it's on the ground and ready
[23:27.900 --> 23:31.180]  for the plant in the vegetative phase.
[23:31.180 --> 23:35.940]  We have seen this where there's too much potassium, especially around flowering
[23:35.940 --> 23:40.780]  or late in the season, and it can really delay maturity.
[23:40.780 --> 23:45.380]  And that's in all crops, you know, it's not just hemp.
[23:45.380 --> 23:47.820]  All right, so micronutrient fertility.
[23:47.820 --> 23:50.740]  Now, we hear a lot about this in hemp.
[23:50.740 --> 23:55.740]  People adding all kinds of concoctions, trying to, you know,
[23:55.740 --> 24:00.580]  add this micronutrient and that micronutrient.
[24:00.580 --> 24:06.660]  So if you're growing in what we call soilless media, so that would be, you know,
[24:06.660 --> 24:11.980]  how you would be growing in a greenhouse, or, you know, I guess maybe if you're growing
[24:11.980 --> 24:19.540]  even hydroponically, then of course, it makes sense to add a micronutrient pack
[24:19.540 --> 24:23.780]  to that mix, because soilless media has, usually has nothing in it,
[24:23.780 --> 24:26.140]  unless you bought it with nutrients.
[24:26.380 --> 24:31.820]  Out in the field, again, really important to get a soil test here,
[24:31.820 --> 24:38.540]  because micronutrients are required and they're essential.
[24:38.540 --> 24:43.020]  But if you put on too much, you can kill your plants.
[24:43.020 --> 24:45.300]  You know, they, you don't need very much.
[24:45.300 --> 24:53.380]  So with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, we're talking 50, 60, 100, 150 pounds per acre.
[24:53.380 --> 25:01.580]  With micronutrients, you're talking a pound, an acre, half a pound, a quarter pound.
[25:01.580 --> 25:05.140]  Okay, so very, very, very small quantities.
[25:05.140 --> 25:10.620]  And if you put on too much, again, it can be detrimental to the plants
[25:10.620 --> 25:12.940]  in more ways than one.
[25:12.940 --> 25:18.220]  Hemp itself has a very strong requirement for magnesium.
[25:18.220 --> 25:23.260]  So you want to make sure you look at your magnesium on a soil test, and also for boron.
[25:23.260 --> 25:28.620]  So boron is deficient in our part of the United States.
[25:28.620 --> 25:36.300]  So I do recommend that growers apply boron to their soils with their other fertility program
[25:36.300 --> 25:39.500]  at about a pound to two pounds per acre.
[25:39.500 --> 25:42.580]  But again, that's very specific to Vermont.
[25:42.580 --> 25:49.140]  And so a soil test in your area is going to help you define what you need.
[25:49.180 --> 25:54.180]  Okay, so let's move on to varieties.
[25:54.180 --> 26:00.020]  And I'm sure somebody in this course probably has gotten into this in depth.
[26:00.020 --> 26:07.660]  But in my experience, purchasing seed, you know, it's gotten a lot better than it was
[26:07.660 --> 26:09.460]  when I first started.
[26:09.460 --> 26:14.820]  But, you know, it still is kind of a little bit buyer beware.
[26:14.820 --> 26:19.220]  You want to make sure you're buying from a reputable company.
[26:19.220 --> 26:25.260]  Companies now, some of the better companies and more reputable have been around for quite
[26:25.260 --> 26:33.420]  a while, have been around since 2015, 2016, and have an established business and an established
[26:33.420 --> 26:35.020]  clientele.
[26:35.020 --> 26:37.140]  They have a good reputation.
[26:37.140 --> 26:42.740]  So you want to make sure that you're buying from a reputable seed source.
[26:43.020 --> 26:51.500]  Even though, you know, any seed person, salesperson can give you a certificate of analysis, it
[26:51.500 --> 26:54.460]  doesn't really mean a whole lot.
[26:54.460 --> 27:00.140]  You know, as folks, at least in the United States know, you know, your crop is getting
[27:00.140 --> 27:01.700]  tested.
[27:01.700 --> 27:08.620]  And even though any seed company can probably show that they were in compliance, that doesn't
[27:08.620 --> 27:13.340]  necessarily mean that the crop is always going to be compliant.
[27:13.340 --> 27:19.500]  So again, just buying from a reputable seed company is really, really important.
[27:19.500 --> 27:23.660]  Seed quality still seems to be all over the board.
[27:23.660 --> 27:32.540]  And you know, again, reputable companies that can provide germination rates and have been
[27:32.540 --> 27:38.140]  in business for a while are those that certainly I would recommend.
[27:38.140 --> 27:42.700]  Compliance is an issue, you know, especially if you're growing for cannabinoids and not
[27:42.700 --> 27:50.700]  high THC and you're trying to meet regulations, you have to make sure that you're growing
[27:50.700 --> 27:53.340]  varieties that are going to be able to do that.
[27:53.340 --> 27:55.660]  And they're all over the board.
[27:55.660 --> 28:01.700]  So looking at independent variety evaluation trials, like the ones we have at UVM and Cornell
[28:01.860 --> 28:04.980]  has and others is important.
[28:04.980 --> 28:09.980]  And again, looking at reputable companies.
[28:09.980 --> 28:14.940]  And here's, you know, information from our variety trials.
[28:14.940 --> 28:19.780]  This is just one year out of many of the years that we've done these trials.
[28:19.780 --> 28:24.140]  You know, there are varieties every year that are not compliant and, you know, we have to
[28:24.140 --> 28:27.220]  destroy them.
[28:27.220 --> 28:34.620]  I think, again, this is getting better as we understand genetics and better varieties
[28:34.620 --> 28:37.380]  are being developed and released.
[28:37.380 --> 28:42.740]  And those companies that are reputable are still in business and those that are not tend
[28:42.740 --> 28:48.420]  to make their way out of business.
[28:48.420 --> 28:51.900]  So again, we offer variety information.
[28:52.220 --> 28:59.180]  Again, it may be specific to, you know, our region, but many of these varieties we're
[28:59.180 --> 29:03.740]  getting across the country, much of the seed from different companies.
[29:03.740 --> 29:06.700]  So the information is there.
[29:06.700 --> 29:12.500]  You can see that obviously they differ widely in flower production, but they also different
[29:12.500 --> 29:18.900]  widely in CBD or other cannabinoid production as well, CBG, etc.
[29:18.900 --> 29:23.220]  So here's from our 2021 trial.
[29:23.220 --> 29:27.500]  Yeah, 2021, we haven't finished 2020 yet.
[29:27.500 --> 29:31.780]  And you can see the difference in yields with the different varieties.
[29:31.780 --> 29:37.780]  Again, this information is available on our website, which I'll put up here in a second.
[29:37.780 --> 29:43.020]  So you can get a chance to look at different varieties that are widely available and how
[29:43.020 --> 29:44.860]  they perform.
[29:44.860 --> 29:47.340]  And here's the cannabinoid data.
[29:47.340 --> 29:48.460]  Here's our website.
[29:48.500 --> 29:51.700]  I can put that in the chat afterwards.
[29:51.700 --> 29:53.140]  We post all of our data.
[29:53.140 --> 29:55.660]  It's available every year.
[29:55.660 --> 30:01.780]  One of the things that we look at in our trials, which takes more time and effort, but I think
[30:01.780 --> 30:08.100]  if you're harvesting by hand, and even if you're not, this is information that's become
[30:08.100 --> 30:10.060]  really important to us.
[30:10.220 --> 30:18.860]  It's looking at the flower to other plant material ratio.
[30:18.860 --> 30:24.500]  If you're harvesting by hand and you have a plant that looks impressive, weighs 50 pounds
[30:24.500 --> 30:29.580]  and you can barely get your arms around it, it's great for photo ops and to send your
[30:29.580 --> 30:34.180]  friends and show them how big your hemp plant was.
[30:34.300 --> 30:40.420]  But when you start breaking that plant down and harvesting it by hand and end up with
[30:40.420 --> 30:47.580]  a pound of flower and about 50 pounds of leaves and stems, you'll realize it's not so cool
[30:47.580 --> 30:48.580]  anymore.
[30:48.580 --> 30:54.320]  You're almost crying because you just can't get through all the leaves.
[30:54.320 --> 31:00.620]  So what we've really been looking at is leaf to bud weight.
[31:00.620 --> 31:02.460]  And it's really interesting.
[31:02.460 --> 31:09.900]  There are varieties that have far more flower buds than they do leaves and or stems.
[31:09.900 --> 31:14.740]  And it makes it much easier to harvest, especially if you're hand harvesting.
[31:14.740 --> 31:21.620]  But depending on what market you're going for, if you're going for the smokable market
[31:21.620 --> 31:27.580]  or biomass, this kind of information becomes much more important.
[31:27.580 --> 31:30.420]  So again, this is all on our website.
[31:30.420 --> 31:33.900]  And you can clearly see there's strong differences.
[31:33.900 --> 31:43.300]  You can look down here at the bottom where almost 30% of the plant material was flower
[31:43.300 --> 31:50.500]  for this bottom variety and 70% was not 70%.
[31:50.500 --> 31:55.380]  Another 40% was leaf weight and the rest was stems.
[31:55.380 --> 32:00.700]  So we want varieties, at least for what we're doing up here in the top, where the majority
[32:00.700 --> 32:03.260]  of the plant is flower bud.
[32:03.260 --> 32:11.500]  For most people, not everybody, that's what's being sold and has the highest levels of cannabinoid
[32:11.500 --> 32:12.540]  concentration.
[32:12.540 --> 32:14.500]  So here's just a little bit of data.
[32:14.500 --> 32:16.660]  Again, this is from 2020.
[32:16.660 --> 32:22.660]  A variety like Lifter as an example is 45% flower and 25% leaf.
[32:22.660 --> 32:29.500]  And on the low end, we had a variety called Anna Lee that was 19% flower and 47% leaf.
[32:29.500 --> 32:38.180]  So again, this kind of information is helpful for growers and probably for breeders as well,
[32:38.180 --> 32:39.180]  I would assume.
[32:39.180 --> 32:47.460]  All right, so getting the plants in the ground and started, we've done a lot of this.
[32:47.460 --> 32:48.660]  We've done direct seeding.
[32:48.660 --> 32:56.100]  We've also done clones and we've done transplant, seedling, transplants from seed.
[32:56.100 --> 33:00.500]  Most now of what we do are transplants direct from seed.
[33:00.500 --> 33:03.660]  We've stopped doing clonal cuttings.
[33:03.660 --> 33:11.140]  I think that works for some people, but a lot more labor, experience needed, time, et
[33:11.140 --> 33:12.140]  cetera.
[33:12.140 --> 33:17.620]  To do that, we can get really good plants started in the greenhouse.
[33:17.620 --> 33:23.060]  Takes about a month to do it, so not very long and you have to be cautious and watch
[33:23.060 --> 33:29.460]  closely because they can quickly become overgrown.
[33:29.460 --> 33:35.740]  And when they become overgrown and leggy, that leads to difficulties with transplanting
[33:35.740 --> 33:37.060]  and establishment.
[33:37.060 --> 33:42.700]  So we use deep cell trays to get more roots.
[33:42.700 --> 33:50.500]  We blow fans on the plants after they come up, try to make those stems a little bit sturdier.
[33:50.500 --> 33:54.740]  You're trying to pack a lot of plants in if you're planting acres and acres, but when
[33:54.740 --> 34:00.300]  those plants are closer together in these cells and they have less room and they start
[34:00.300 --> 34:03.580]  to touch, that's when they become elongated.
[34:03.580 --> 34:11.740]  So there's lots of ways to try to space things out and make more robust, a little bit shorter
[34:11.780 --> 34:14.180]  plants for transplanting.
[34:14.180 --> 34:18.940]  Those are just a few of the things that we've done using deep 72s.
[34:18.940 --> 34:24.220]  I prefer deep 50s to be able to get the best plants.
[34:24.220 --> 34:32.500]  And one month, it's not very long, so you got to plan for field delays as well.
[34:32.500 --> 34:39.220]  And this can happen in a wet year or a cold year where plants can end up being in the
[34:39.220 --> 34:42.700]  greenhouse sometimes three weeks longer than you had planned.
[34:42.700 --> 34:46.940]  So these are all considerations if you're starting from transplant.
[34:46.940 --> 34:53.900]  We have done from seed as well, especially your day neutrals.
[34:53.900 --> 35:00.220]  We've done from seed and this is tricky.
[35:00.220 --> 35:06.660]  We have had good germ and really bad germ doing this.
[35:06.660 --> 35:10.980]  And soil health is sort of at the bottom of this.
[35:10.980 --> 35:19.620]  You can see we planted twice the day neutral varieties.
[35:19.620 --> 35:24.380]  You can see when we planted in June, we only had 47% germ.
[35:24.380 --> 35:26.900]  We had a huge rainstorm.
[35:26.900 --> 35:31.540]  The soil got really crusted and compacted, which is what happened.
[35:31.540 --> 35:35.180]  It was in a poor part of the field, poor part of the farm.
[35:35.180 --> 35:38.140]  Soil quality was low.
[35:38.140 --> 35:40.620]  And we saw the results of that.
[35:40.620 --> 35:47.620]  And we planted a second planting at the end of July and saw much better germ, but we had
[35:47.620 --> 35:48.620]  better soil conditions.
[35:48.620 --> 35:54.700]  So if you are planting from seed, be very cautious about where you're putting the hemp
[35:54.700 --> 36:03.860]  because it is very, very sensitive to soil quality as it's emerging and getting started.
[36:03.860 --> 36:08.420]  So transplanting hemp, people may or may not have experience with this.
[36:08.420 --> 36:11.620]  There's a lot of ways to do it by hand.
[36:11.620 --> 36:19.140]  We do this mostly, again, you have to be careful and patient and good plants coming out of
[36:19.140 --> 36:20.540]  the greenhouse work the best.
[36:20.540 --> 36:25.940]  If they're too leggy and thin or the roots aren't that great, it's just going to be hard
[36:25.940 --> 36:30.180]  to put them in the ground and for them to survive.
[36:30.180 --> 36:36.860]  If you're using a transplanter, like the one here, same kind of thing.
[36:36.860 --> 36:41.580]  You're just really looking for stout, robust plants to put in the ground to have the best
[36:41.580 --> 36:42.580]  success.
[36:42.580 --> 36:46.540]  These are perfect, really, in my opinion.
[36:46.540 --> 36:47.540]  Perfect size.
[36:47.540 --> 36:50.820]  These being a little bit long, have some challenges there.
[36:50.820 --> 36:51.820]  You'll have more loss.
[36:51.820 --> 36:57.340]  You get a wind, it'll kind of just break right off.
[36:57.500 --> 37:03.700]  We have done a little bit with no-till into rolled in crimp rye.
[37:03.700 --> 37:09.420]  I would say it's possible, but we're still kind of working out the details of this.
[37:09.420 --> 37:14.460]  I need some more time before we show you any results.
[37:14.460 --> 37:17.020]  A lot of people are still using plastic mulch.
[37:17.020 --> 37:18.700]  I think that's fine.
[37:18.700 --> 37:25.300]  Plastic mulch has a lot of benefits, especially if you're in a cold area like we are here
[37:25.300 --> 37:36.220]  in Vermont, but requires more equipment, requires plastic.
[37:36.220 --> 37:41.740]  Not only is most plastics not a renewable resource, but you also have to get rid of
[37:41.740 --> 37:45.140]  that plastic after the season is over.
[37:45.140 --> 37:47.380]  Where are you going to put it?
[37:47.380 --> 37:50.740]  Probably in the landfill.
[37:50.740 --> 37:56.260]  There's some sustainability questions around mulch.
[37:56.260 --> 37:59.580]  There are biodegradable mulches and things like that.
[37:59.580 --> 38:06.980]  Again, they all work well and they have a lot of benefits, but hemp can grow just as
[38:06.980 --> 38:10.940]  well without plastic mulch.
[38:10.940 --> 38:13.940]  Maybe even better, to be honest.
[38:13.940 --> 38:21.900]  If you are growing in plastic mulch and raised beds, you got to have irrigation as well because
[38:21.900 --> 38:25.820]  you got to get water through the plastic mulch.
[38:25.820 --> 38:30.500]  That's a whole other piece of management if you're going to grow hemp because then you
[38:30.500 --> 38:36.300]  have to have irrigation, you have to have the setup for irrigation, and be able to water
[38:36.300 --> 38:39.340]  those plants under that plastic.
[38:39.380 --> 38:45.300]  Here's another picture of transplanters, people transplanting hemp.
[38:45.300 --> 38:46.820]  A lot of people are doing it.
[38:46.820 --> 38:50.580]  You can see the scale here, lots of plastic.
[38:50.580 --> 38:57.660]  Again, works well, but also not necessary.
[38:57.660 --> 39:05.340]  Without plastic, you got less input cost, but you have other challenges, bare ground,
[39:05.340 --> 39:10.900]  erosion, weeds, disease, all those things.
[39:10.900 --> 39:15.220]  You can grow without plastic and the plants can grow really well.
[39:15.220 --> 39:22.300]  If you have natural rainfall, you likely get enough rainfall to grow a really good robust
[39:22.300 --> 39:30.740]  plant in most years, so you may not have to invest in irrigation, but you can have success
[39:30.740 --> 39:34.660]  hopefully.
[39:34.980 --> 39:40.780]  Plant spacing, spent a lot of debate over this over the last few years.
[39:40.780 --> 39:45.940]  You can plant hemp close together in our day neutral varieties.
[39:45.940 --> 39:53.900]  We do two by two, two feet by two feet, and some people use a spacing of one foot by one
[39:53.900 --> 39:55.500]  foot.
[39:55.500 --> 40:03.900]  In our full season, sort of photo period sensitive plants, we are still using four by four feet
[40:03.940 --> 40:09.340]  or five by five feet for the most part, but people have looked at everything in between.
[40:09.340 --> 40:15.700]  Again, there are benefits to any plant spacing.
[40:15.700 --> 40:22.740]  It really depends on your environment and what you want to accomplish, how you're harvesting,
[40:22.740 --> 40:25.540]  what your end market is.
[40:25.540 --> 40:30.660]  You can see we get higher yields with one by one because there's a lot more plants packed
[40:31.140 --> 40:40.420]  into an acre, but it's also a lot bigger investment in seed for that return.
[40:40.420 --> 40:48.660]  And again, it's also a lot more plants to harvest, potentially more disease, so you
[40:48.660 --> 40:52.500]  can see the unmarketable yield that's there.
[40:52.500 --> 40:58.460]  So again, it really depends on your goals for your business, what you're trying to do,
[40:58.460 --> 41:04.380]  the equipment you have, whether you want to pack those plants in there or space them
[41:04.380 --> 41:08.100]  out far apart.
[41:08.100 --> 41:17.660]  We do see a difference as well in CBD, or I'm sorry, we don't see any difference in
[41:17.660 --> 41:26.700]  CBD production based on plant spacing, but we do see the yield difference.
[41:26.940 --> 41:31.020]  Okay, let's see here.
[41:31.020 --> 41:35.980]  If we're looking at per plant yields, I'm sure this makes sense, right?
[41:35.980 --> 41:48.000]  With more spacing, each individual plant yields much more, but there's more plants per acre
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.500]  with a one by one spacing, right?
[41:50.500 --> 41:55.180]  So this is per acre yields, and this is per plant yields.
[41:55.180 --> 42:01.300]  So if you're going for a high end smokable market, you certainly want to focus on this
[42:01.300 --> 42:05.300]  wider plant spacing.
[42:05.300 --> 42:12.220]  The benefit to a wider plant spacing also we found, or a slight benefit, is that we
[42:12.220 --> 42:19.220]  get more bud and less leaves, which is a really good benefit.
[42:19.220 --> 42:24.620]  And with a shorter plant spacing, closer plant spacing, we get more disease.
[42:24.620 --> 42:30.780]  All right, planning date, and again, we're running short on time.
[42:30.780 --> 42:35.740]  So we'll kind of wrap up, I think, with a couple of last items.
[42:35.740 --> 42:43.280]  Planning date here is, at least in Vermont, we're looking at optimizing planning dates
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.060]  around the beginning of June.
[42:47.060 --> 42:54.020]  You can get decent yields if you extend that planning date into mid to end of June.
[42:54.020 --> 42:59.660]  You can still get yields, I hear that from a lot of people, but maximum yields we get
[42:59.660 --> 43:05.060]  here if we plant by the beginning of June.
[43:05.060 --> 43:09.020]  And these are from transplants that are about a month old.
[43:09.020 --> 43:13.500]  And you can also see probably the biggest difference, and maybe the most important thing,
[43:13.500 --> 43:24.380]  is with that longer growth period, we get higher levels of CBD and other cannabinoids.
[43:24.380 --> 43:29.020]  Quite a bit higher than delaying the planning date until the end of June, right?
[43:29.020 --> 43:36.140]  Because these plants have a longer period of time to be able to maximize flower quality.
[43:37.140 --> 43:45.020]  All right, so I know that we need to wrap up by about quarter of, 10 of 3, and we're
[43:45.020 --> 43:46.020]  almost there.
[43:46.020 --> 43:50.620]  So I'll just talk a little bit about irrigation and drought resistance.
[43:50.620 --> 43:55.820]  We do know that hemp can be resistant to drought once it's established.
[43:55.820 --> 44:00.540]  So I want people to remember that you got to get the crop out of the ground, or you
[44:00.540 --> 44:04.180]  need to get those transplants established.
[44:04.220 --> 44:08.780]  And you saw the root system, that's how it can be so drought resistant.
[44:08.780 --> 44:17.500]  So you need to have soil conditions that allow for maximum root exploration to be able to
[44:17.500 --> 44:21.980]  provide the hemp with that sort of level of drought resistance.
[44:21.980 --> 44:27.700]  Because really, the hemp itself does actually require for maximum productivity about 20
[44:27.700 --> 44:30.440]  to 30 inches of rainfall.
[44:30.440 --> 44:35.760]  So it does need abundant moisture, especially early on in its growth.
[44:35.760 --> 44:43.200]  Once we get to flowering, the need for water, like most crops, as flower is set, starts
[44:43.200 --> 44:44.840]  to go down.
[44:44.840 --> 44:54.320]  So as far as irrigation goes, it's not necessary depending on where you live, but it can be
[44:54.320 --> 44:59.960]  super helpful for establishment of the crop in particular.
[45:00.480 --> 45:07.120]  But you also have to be careful not to overwater because irrigation, too much water can lead
[45:07.120 --> 45:11.800]  to rots, which you can see here, and other diseases.
[45:11.800 --> 45:18.720]  So we have seen a benefit with timely irrigation to yields versus just rain fed here in the
[45:18.720 --> 45:19.720]  Northeast.
[45:19.720 --> 45:27.480]  But again, it's not necessarily, we can still obtain decent yields in most every year without
[45:27.640 --> 45:32.760]  it, but it can be helpful to have irrigation available, especially in a dry year.
[45:32.760 --> 45:39.960]  All right, the last thing I'll know is on cover crops, because I get a lot of questions
[45:39.960 --> 45:43.320]  around utilizing cover crops.
[45:43.320 --> 45:49.800]  If you have plastic mulch, or even if you don't, there's lots of opportunities to enhance
[45:49.800 --> 45:53.160]  soil health in your hemp.
[45:53.360 --> 46:00.840]  We have grown all kinds of cover crops between our hemp rows over the years that we've been
[46:00.840 --> 46:02.840]  doing this.
[46:02.840 --> 46:09.800]  Cover crops can establish very nicely, especially when you have a five by five setup, or three
[46:09.800 --> 46:13.680]  feet by three feet, four by four feet.
[46:13.680 --> 46:19.160]  You can get a really good cover in between those rows if you want.
[46:19.160 --> 46:20.960]  There's lots of options.
[46:20.960 --> 46:27.960]  I think one take home message we can end on is you want to make sure you have good airflow,
[46:27.960 --> 46:34.960]  so you don't want to be growing some massive, high, tall, dense cover crop necessarily,
[46:34.960 --> 46:38.880]  because that's going to impede airflow.
[46:38.880 --> 46:46.080]  You want to be a little bit cautious about certain cover crops that might attract pests
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.240]  that you don't want on your hemp, or diseases.
[46:50.240 --> 46:52.720]  You want to be cautious about that.
[46:52.720 --> 47:01.200]  We have actually found a cover crop of annual ryegrass mixed with low growing white clover
[47:01.200 --> 47:05.200]  and tillage radish works very nicely for us.
[47:05.200 --> 47:12.040]  Again, there's a lot of options here to improve soil health and reduce weed pressure.
[47:12.040 --> 47:17.120]  I think with that, we will end and take some questions here.
[47:17.160 --> 47:23.640]  I want to make sure we have some time for questions.
[47:23.640 --> 47:26.400]  I see there's questions.
[47:26.400 --> 47:36.880]  I'll start with the ones in the Q&A, since that's where we're supposed to put our questions.
[47:36.880 --> 47:41.760]  Is there a soil mix that we can make at home for starting seed indoors?
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.160]  That's a really good question.
[47:44.160 --> 47:46.720]  I don't start my own mix.
[47:46.720 --> 47:51.120]  I rely on others to do that for me.
[47:51.120 --> 47:58.400]  You just want to make sure that, and I caution people of this, because people will buy potting
[47:58.400 --> 48:06.320]  mixes that sound really great, but don't have enough fertility in them.
[48:06.320 --> 48:09.400]  I actually even grow a plant for a month.
[48:09.400 --> 48:15.160]  You just want to make sure that you have, and there's a lot of potting mixes out there
[48:15.320 --> 48:21.240]  that are blended now just for hemp that would be good to start with.
[48:21.240 --> 48:24.920]  You want to buy something that does have fertility in it.
[48:24.920 --> 48:33.880]  It's not just peat moss or even really overly composted materials.
[48:33.880 --> 48:39.000]  I haven't made my own.
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  Was recommended N pounds per acre, so I did go over that a little bit.
[48:44.040 --> 48:49.760]  Typically, I think for most people, if you're starting with a soil that has low organic
[48:49.760 --> 48:52.560]  matter, and again, this is why you need a soil test.
[48:52.560 --> 49:00.400]  If you have 1% to 2% organic matter and you haven't added any compost or other organic
[49:00.400 --> 49:09.000]  amendments, likely you're going to need about 100 to 150 pounds of nitrogen per acre.
[49:09.000 --> 49:16.560]  If you have a very fertile soil with lots, you've been adding compost year after year
[49:16.560 --> 49:21.360]  after year, it's likely you would need very little, maybe 50 pounds.
[49:21.360 --> 49:26.280]  It really depends on where you're starting.
[49:26.280 --> 49:29.000]  What about nitrogen rate for fiber?
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.040]  We have done those.
[49:31.080 --> 49:41.680]  I would say so far what we have seen is nitrogen recommendations for all of the hemp crops
[49:41.680 --> 49:43.800]  are about the same.
[49:43.800 --> 49:51.280]  We have done trials in grain fiber and for flour, and they are coming out about the same.
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.720]  That sort of 100 to 125 pounds.
[49:55.720 --> 50:06.240]  If you have an organic matter level of about 3% to 4%, which is what we have.
[50:06.240 --> 50:07.440]  Did we use urea?
[50:07.440 --> 50:11.100]  No, we didn't use urea.
[50:11.100 --> 50:17.240]  It depended on the year, but we did use a synthetic nitrogen source.
[50:17.240 --> 50:22.040]  The reason we did that is because we wanted to know that we were getting exactly what
[50:22.040 --> 50:24.160]  we thought we were putting on.
[50:24.160 --> 50:29.600]  I know there's questions around worm castings, compost, but when you're doing a nitrogen
[50:29.600 --> 50:35.160]  trial, you want to make sure if you're putting on 150 pounds of nitrogen, that is all available
[50:35.160 --> 50:36.520]  to the plant.
[50:36.520 --> 50:38.960]  What did we put on each application?
[50:38.960 --> 50:42.680]  It really depended on the treatment.
[50:42.680 --> 50:51.720]  We generally start with about 50 pounds pre-plant of actual N, and then we would add from there.
[50:52.480 --> 51:01.560]  Are we talking about cannabis being grown for cannabinoids, fibers, or biomass?
[51:01.560 --> 51:09.720]  All the data I showed you today was for cannabinoids.
[51:09.720 --> 51:10.720]  We haven't seen an increase.
[51:10.720 --> 51:13.760]  I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be saying these questions.
[51:13.760 --> 51:15.520]  I apologize.
[51:15.520 --> 51:21.200]  Somebody is asking about the scientific reason for increased number of male plants under
[51:21.320 --> 51:24.960]  high N rates.
[51:24.960 --> 51:32.960]  Usually when we see males being expressed or any kinds often of these abnormalities,
[51:32.960 --> 51:38.280]  it usually has to do with some kind of stress on the plant.
[51:38.280 --> 51:48.000]  I don't have a good scientific explanation for that, but I would say that it likely is
[51:48.400 --> 51:55.880]  some kind of indicator of stress and the plant wanting to reproduce and make seed.
[51:55.880 --> 51:59.000]  It's really probably what it comes down to.
[51:59.000 --> 52:05.680]  How much sulfur does hemp plant seed and should sulfur be put down up front?
[52:05.680 --> 52:09.160]  Sulfur does leach.
[52:09.160 --> 52:14.640]  It's another nutrient that we have to be careful about when we apply it.
[52:14.800 --> 52:21.760]  Using sulfur-based complete fertilizer can be really helpful.
[52:21.760 --> 52:30.000]  If you need potassium, sulfur, and magnesium, all critical in hemp production, you can use
[52:30.000 --> 52:37.240]  fertilizers like Sopomag, which is also approved for use in organic.
[52:37.240 --> 52:43.040]  Generally about 25 to 50 pounds of sulfur is what is required.
[52:43.360 --> 52:50.970]  But again, soil test.
[52:50.970 --> 52:56.650]  Do we harvest varieties early to be compliant with the THC percent?
[52:56.650 --> 53:12.250]  Yes, we actually track THC and CBD starting for us anyway about three weeks after flowering
[53:12.290 --> 53:20.930]  starts so that we can figure out if we're moving out of compliance.
[53:20.930 --> 53:26.850]  We are at a university, so we have a little bit more leniency in our work.
[53:26.850 --> 53:35.610]  Part of what we're trying to do is figure out when crops and varieties can exceed that
[53:35.610 --> 53:36.610]  level.
[53:37.610 --> 53:47.330]  But yes, we have had to destroy crops because they've gone above the allowable level.
[53:47.330 --> 53:53.890]  I think everybody knows that THC and CBD, they go up together.
[53:53.890 --> 53:59.250]  If CBD is going up, so isn't THC.
[53:59.250 --> 54:05.770]  Maximizing one also means that you've likely, you may not have maximized THC, but the longer
[54:05.930 --> 54:10.090]  you wait, the higher both levels are going to get to a point.
[54:10.090 --> 54:12.730]  So again, look at our research data.
[54:12.730 --> 54:17.130]  You can see those maximum levels for many of the varieties.
[54:17.130 --> 54:20.330]  Is that it?
[54:20.330 --> 54:21.330]  No.
[54:21.330 --> 54:28.970]  Luis, is there anything you need to cover or do we just keep going?
[54:28.970 --> 54:32.090]  If you have the time, we can go over the remaining questions.
[54:32.090 --> 54:33.090]  Yeah, absolutely.
[54:33.930 --> 54:39.490]  Have we looked at nutritional requirements for day neutral varieties versus full term?
[54:39.490 --> 54:51.130]  We have not specifically compared nitrogen rates for day neutral varieties.
[54:51.130 --> 54:57.970]  I'm making an assumption, but it's likely the same.
[54:57.970 --> 55:04.890]  I say that because the plants will require, they may be smaller, but there's generally
[55:04.890 --> 55:09.090]  more of them.
[55:09.090 --> 55:14.210]  You will want to fertilize for the additional plant, if that makes sense.
[55:14.210 --> 55:18.970]  So the recommended rate is probably about the same.
[55:18.970 --> 55:22.970]  I wouldn't think that it would be less.
[55:22.970 --> 55:23.970]  Okay.
[55:23.970 --> 55:24.970]  Let's see.
[55:25.970 --> 55:32.010]  Let's see here.
[55:32.010 --> 55:37.770]  I did answer this question with the larger spacing, so the five by five.
[55:37.770 --> 55:41.730]  Did we notice a difference in overall cannabinoids?
[55:41.730 --> 55:48.570]  We did not see a difference in the cannabinoid levels between the plant spacings, but there
[55:48.570 --> 55:51.410]  was a yield difference.
[55:51.410 --> 55:54.490]  All right.
[55:54.610 --> 55:59.450]  My other question is whether you have ever observed increased male plants under drought
[55:59.450 --> 56:04.690]  stress?
[56:04.690 --> 56:14.090]  So we get a decent amount of natural rainfall in Vermont, and what we often consider dry
[56:14.090 --> 56:19.970]  by Vermont standards is certainly not a drought by any means for the most part.
[56:19.970 --> 56:28.890]  So I have not, I can't say that I have observed even in our driest years in Vermont, which
[56:28.890 --> 56:32.730]  we've had a few growing hemp, more males.
[56:32.730 --> 56:38.200]  I've not seen that.
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.040]  Are our research plots without plastic mulch?
[56:42.040 --> 56:44.520]  Some of them are and some of them aren't.
[56:44.520 --> 56:49.640]  So our plant spacing study was without mulch.
[56:49.640 --> 56:52.720]  Our fertility studies are without mulch.
[56:52.720 --> 56:58.200]  The variety evaluation is on black plastic mulch.
[56:58.200 --> 57:04.760]  So usually, or always, when you're reading our research reports, it will differentiate.
[57:04.760 --> 57:10.680]  It will tell you which trials are with and without mulch.
[57:10.720 --> 57:22.910]  And we can obtain, as I said, just as high as yields with or without mulch.
[57:22.910 --> 57:27.230]  How do you tackle an outbreak of atritis?
[57:27.230 --> 57:29.510]  That is a good question.
[57:29.510 --> 57:38.320]  And I think you're going to have somebody speak here on diseases and pest management.
[57:38.320 --> 57:40.640]  Don't get desperate and reach for something.
[57:40.640 --> 57:42.240]  This will be my advice.
[57:42.240 --> 57:48.000]  Don't get desperate and reach for something that is not approved for use in hemp.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.920]  I will say that that's happened here in Vermont.
[57:52.920 --> 57:53.920]  I get it.
[57:53.920 --> 57:54.920]  I'm a farmer too.
[57:54.920 --> 57:58.160]  I own a farm.
[57:58.160 --> 57:59.640]  I grew up on a farm.
[57:59.640 --> 58:06.160]  I know what it's like to feel that, those moments of desperation in all different ways,
[58:06.160 --> 58:11.760]  but especially when you're about to lose a crop and you feel pretty helpless and it's
[58:12.280 --> 58:15.680]  A lot of money invested, time, effort, all those things.
[58:15.680 --> 58:26.200]  And yeah, there are some products and with all of these, with everything, all the treatments
[58:26.200 --> 58:32.080]  really that are available for hemp, you need to be applying before you see atritis.
[58:32.080 --> 58:37.160]  Maybe people are, but they're mostly preventative measures.
[58:37.160 --> 58:42.120]  So we have seen, I will say we've done trials with different fungicides.
[58:42.120 --> 58:43.120]  It's on my website.
[58:43.120 --> 58:45.360]  So go look at that.
[58:45.360 --> 58:51.920]  Mil-stop, which is a bicarb, bicarbonate material approved.
[58:51.920 --> 58:55.280]  It's approved here in Vermont for use on hemp.
[58:55.280 --> 59:03.240]  It may not be other places, but bicarbs have for us worked fairly well and for growers
[59:03.240 --> 59:04.240]  too.
[59:04.240 --> 59:05.620]  And they're approved organic.
[59:05.620 --> 59:08.220]  And at least here they are approved in hemp.
[59:08.220 --> 59:18.620]  So but you need to check with your state or whoever manages pesticides in your area.
[59:18.620 --> 59:21.620]  What kind of spray rig did we use?
[59:21.620 --> 59:26.340]  We have all kinds of different types of sprayers, but I like our, we have a small backpack air
[59:26.340 --> 59:27.340]  blast sprayer.
[59:27.340 --> 59:32.420]  So if you're growing on a small scale, it costs about $350.
[59:32.420 --> 59:37.820]  It does a really great job of covering the plants because it obviously can be really
[59:37.820 --> 59:38.820]  big.
[59:38.820 --> 59:46.060]  It again, it's listed in our progress report online, the manufacturer and the sprayer,
[59:46.060 --> 59:48.720]  but it's, you know, it's gas powered.
[59:48.720 --> 59:51.060]  So you know, it's heavy on your back.
[59:51.060 --> 59:55.940]  It holds about three gallons of material, but it can spray a really fine mist and you
[59:55.940 --> 59:59.100]  can get really excellent coverage on the plant.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:05.780]  And then other than that, a lot of people are using like orchard sprayers in their hemp
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:13.660]  for spraying.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.100]  Harvest moisture and recommended storage moisture.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:21.060]  I didn't, I didn't get to that.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:25.100]  And I'm not sure, are you going to have somebody talking about that, Luis?
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.100]  Sorry, I was keeping track of the Q&A.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.460]  No, no, that's fine.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.460]  Storage moistures.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.100]  Are you going to have somebody talking post storage?
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:41.140]  Yes, so there will be a person talking about harvest and another person talking about processing.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.580]  So that should be covered in the next sessions.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580]  Yeah.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.580]  Okay.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.580]  Yeah.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.220]  I mean, we dry, I will say we dry down to 8%.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:58.340]  I look at hemp as, you know, basically like, hey, I'm from dairy, dairy country, you know,
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:04.100]  so we produce a lot of hay and if you're going to store hay for over a long period of time,
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:08.100]  it's got to be around 8%.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.060]  So, yes.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:15.220]  For that, now let me, I think I answered everything there.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.220]  Yep, that should be all.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:21.220]  All right.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.220]  Well, thank you so much Dr. Darby.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:31.220]  Yeah, and I'm sorry that I see some people saying it was hard to, hard to hear and I apologize for that.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.220]  It must have been my mic or my movement.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.220]  Yeah, no worries.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.220]  I mean, it will be recorded.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:46.220]  I was able to hear you well so hopefully in the recording, it will be better for all people, and they can access it on the YouTube channel, the Cornell Seeds YouTube channel.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.220]  So, not just this but also past and future webinars.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.220]  Thank you so much everyone.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.220]  Thanks so much Dr. Darby.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.220]  It was a fantastic presentation.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:02.220]  Please join us in two weeks for pests in hemp, hyconine on hemp by Dr. Katie Britt.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:13.380]  Thank you so much.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:19.380]  This has been a production of Cornell University on the web at Cornell.edu.
