[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:11.910 --> 00:19.350]  I would love to welcome everyone to Cornell University's New York State Agricultural
[00:19.350 --> 00:24.230]  Experiment Station, part of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell.
[00:24.230 --> 00:31.030]  My name is Christine Smart and I'm the director of the School of Integrative Plant Science.
[00:31.990 --> 00:40.470]  Our hope for today is actually to have everyone, I mean we're going to introduce sort of the hemp
[00:40.470 --> 00:48.790]  team at Cornell, at least those of us that are here, and then we'll have some folks describing
[00:49.350 --> 00:55.670]  some of the research that's happening. But my goal is really to have folks out in the field
[00:55.670 --> 01:00.550]  looking at the hemp and interacting with our hemp team. So once you know what folks do,
[01:00.550 --> 01:05.430]  if you have a question about, you know, the overall project, I'm, to be honest, I'm pretty
[01:05.430 --> 01:09.830]  much the administrator of the project and a lot of the other folks here are doing some of the
[01:09.830 --> 01:14.070]  research. So, you know, if you have questions about economics, you can talk to, you know, Judd,
[01:14.070 --> 01:19.350]  who you'll meet. If you have questions about the varieties we have here, we have experts on that.
[01:20.150 --> 01:25.670]  And so I hope, I always think it's fun to be out and walking around the plant and asking questions
[01:25.670 --> 01:34.870]  there. So that's our goal. So, I don't have the, I don't actually have a copy of the agenda.
[01:36.310 --> 01:41.990]  But I'm going to go with, yeah, why don't you start with the variety trial. All right,
[01:43.030 --> 01:50.070]  so what we have out here is a variety trial and the trial is planted at six different locations,
[01:50.070 --> 01:59.190]  four near the Ithaca campus and two here up in Geneva. And Jamie Crawford is here. Come on up,
[01:59.190 --> 02:06.310]  Jamie. She works for Don Vines, who is one of the co-leads on the project. And she'll talk briefly
[02:06.310 --> 02:11.270]  about the trial. And there's a handout. There's a handout. If you don't have that, we can pass
[02:11.270 --> 02:18.470]  those around. So, Jamie. So, Glenn, like I said, I work for Don Vines. He was very excited to be
[02:18.470 --> 02:23.510]  here and to talk to all of you today. But when we first got started on this project, it was sort
[02:23.510 --> 02:31.590]  of an adventure. It makes me that much. But we were able to line up the 17 different varieties
[02:31.590 --> 02:37.190]  that will be, that you'll see out here in the trials today. So, you'll want to grab a handout.
[02:37.990 --> 02:43.750]  If you, I got here a little late. I apologize for that. So, on these handouts, you know,
[02:43.750 --> 02:47.350]  you'll see there's 13 different grain and dual-purchase varieties.
[02:48.070 --> 02:53.590]  And then we've got four different fiber varieties that we're testing.
[02:56.310 --> 03:03.110]  On the front of the page, there's a little bit of information on the different trial sites and
[03:03.110 --> 03:09.350]  planting dates and the sorts of soils that are in those locations. So, there's everything from
[03:09.990 --> 03:16.710]  very well-drained. So, there's a, like a gravelly field and a sandy field. And then it's got some
[03:16.710 --> 03:22.630]  somewhat poorly-drained spots that were planted also. So, just to sort of see the full spectrum
[03:22.630 --> 03:29.990]  of how that can perform in all these different locations. So, for our trials, there's,
[03:30.950 --> 03:39.590]  we planted them in four-foot by 20-foot plots. And the, each variety replicated four times
[03:40.230 --> 03:45.430]  in each trial. So, we'll be able to get some good yield estimates from that.
[03:46.950 --> 03:51.430]  We aimed for a three-quarters inch planting depth in all of our locations.
[03:52.870 --> 03:58.310]  And, except for one where we know the soil packs really tightly. So, farmers are going to want to
[03:58.310 --> 04:02.150]  know something about the soil where they're planting it. And that's what they're going to
[04:02.150 --> 04:08.150]  have to use as a basis for your planting depth. And even if that half-inch planting depth, we had
[04:08.150 --> 04:19.590]  poor establishment because we had a cool snap right after planting and rain. So,
[04:21.670 --> 04:26.390]  if you guys have planted corn before, you know you don't want to plant it before a cold snap,
[04:26.390 --> 04:33.590]  right? And, but hemp is even more sensitive than that. So, we had good establishment in all of our
[04:33.590 --> 04:39.830]  trials except for the one where it got down into the 40s with a cold rain afterwards. And so,
[04:39.830 --> 04:45.030]  our first trial we had about an average of 12 plants per square foot. And then, in the second
[04:45.030 --> 04:51.350]  one, it was closer to five. You know, they were only planted five days apart, but that three-day
[04:51.350 --> 04:58.070]  window after planting is really important. So, Amelia's going to tell you a little bit about
[04:58.070 --> 05:02.790]  our other trials around the state. You can see the one behind you, which is looking very nice.
[05:03.350 --> 05:07.270]  But, she'll tell you about some of our other ones and then we'll pass it on.
[05:08.550 --> 05:13.670]  All right, so I've been- Amelia, why don't you introduce yourself? Sorry. Yes, so I'm Amelia. I'm
[05:13.670 --> 05:21.830]  the research, the hemp research intern this summer. So, with the help of our student employees,
[05:21.830 --> 05:28.550]  I've been collecting data on all of our trials in Ithaca, East Ithaca, and Freeville on a weekly
[05:28.550 --> 05:35.110]  basis. These data include notes on height, sand, and flowering. As you can see, all of our varieties
[05:35.110 --> 05:40.630]  are in bloom now, even the fiber varieties, which have been bred to bloom much later in the season.
[05:41.590 --> 05:46.710]  Something that I've noticed is that the monoecious varieties, which are the plants that have
[05:47.350 --> 05:53.910]  male and female plants, or male and female parts on the same plant, flower later than
[05:53.910 --> 05:59.670]  the dioecious varieties. Monoecious varieties also seem to have a slower, but much steadier
[05:59.670 --> 06:06.390]  and more linear growth rate than the dioecious varieties. The dioecious varieties have had a
[06:06.390 --> 06:10.310]  growth spurt earlier in the season, which has declined since they started to flower.
[06:10.950 --> 06:15.670]  This pattern of growth has created major differences in height between the monoecious and
[06:15.670 --> 06:22.150]  dioecious varieties. The monoecious varieties on pretty much all of our trials are between one and
[06:22.150 --> 06:28.950]  three feet taller than the dioecious varieties. Something that we've also learned through doing
[06:28.950 --> 06:34.630]  these trials so far is that establishment is crucial. Hemp seedlings seem to be very wimpy.
[06:36.470 --> 06:41.110]  It seems that soil type and planting date may have a strong effect on establishment.
[06:42.150 --> 06:47.110]  As Jamie mentioned, our first trial was planted just five days earlier than our East Ithaca trial,
[06:48.630 --> 06:55.510]  but the establishment difference is huge, and on average, our first trial is almost two feet
[06:55.510 --> 07:01.030]  taller than the East Ithaca trial. Perhaps the planting date doesn't matter as much because it's
[07:01.030 --> 07:08.710]  only a five day difference, but the plants are much shorter and they're now having trouble
[07:08.710 --> 07:14.950]  outcompeting the weeds. The East Ithaca trial also didn't get the 78 additional pounds of fertilizer,
[07:14.950 --> 07:20.070]  which may have a strong effect. It seems that hemp is this very heavy eater, and our first
[07:20.070 --> 07:26.790]  trial was also planted following alfalfa. It was planted, alfalfa was planted there for years, so
[07:27.350 --> 07:33.190]  that may also make a huge difference. Our late Ithaca trial, the second trial on the
[07:33.190 --> 07:39.510]  galleon field, was planted just a day after the first grain trial here in Geneva, but on average
[07:39.510 --> 07:45.590]  is about seven inches taller. We're not sure whether that's because of soil type or amount
[07:45.590 --> 07:52.710]  of rain or something else. We plan on combining the grain and purpose trial in Ithaca sometime
[07:52.790 --> 08:00.870]  late this summer and into the fall when 70 percent of the seeds are mature, which will be very soon,
[08:00.870 --> 08:06.070]  it seems, and the fiber trial will be harvested between flowering and seed set, which will
[08:06.070 --> 08:17.350]  probably happen. Are your notes posted on the website? Some of those little nuggets? Not yet.
[08:17.910 --> 08:23.190]  We don't have any sort of definitive data yet, so these are some of the observations that we've
[08:23.190 --> 08:29.590]  made, but when we have something more solid, that would be good. And when you said fertilizer,
[08:29.590 --> 08:37.270]  was it triple or what would you put on there? We started out with 10-20-20. That was our initial,
[08:37.270 --> 08:44.070]  and then I also have some on the self-based. So in this trial, 30 pounds per acre of the 10-20-20,
[08:44.150 --> 08:49.910]  and then after they were up, 60 pounds of ammonium sulfate, and that's consistent with all the
[08:49.910 --> 08:56.070]  different locations or just here? That's consistent with almost all of the locations.
[08:57.430 --> 09:03.270]  So we have another trial on another farm here in Geneva, and we put triple 19 and incorporated that
[09:03.270 --> 09:08.470]  at the planting time. And was it based on soil tests? You're trying to balance everything out,
[09:08.470 --> 09:12.390]  and that's why, or were you doing different fertilizers for the part of the research?
[09:13.270 --> 09:19.030]  One of your questions. Okay, sorry. Let me introduce myself. I'm Larry Smart. I'm a
[09:19.030 --> 09:23.110]  professor and Geneva program leader in the horticulture section at the School of Integrated
[09:23.110 --> 09:29.670]  Plant Science, and I also hold a joint appointment under John Friedman. So the question was about
[09:29.670 --> 09:36.950]  fertility, and for this initial set of trials, we wanted to keep it fairly simple, so we tried to
[09:36.950 --> 09:43.110]  standardize the fertilization results. That would certainly be an important topic that we want to
[09:43.110 --> 09:49.750]  look at next year. And the Freeville trial is organic. Oh, no, on a organic soil. So that's
[09:49.750 --> 09:55.590]  straight manure when you're saying organic? Yeah, there's no... It's uncertified organic ground.
[09:58.310 --> 10:03.910]  But the only fertilizer that would be on there is manure. Or fish emulsion. Or compost.
[10:04.710 --> 10:11.590]  Cover crops. Let me also say that Jen Gilbert Jenkins at Morrisville is doing fertilization
[10:12.070 --> 10:20.630]  trials this year. So I just want to talk a little bit about how the governor and commissioner has
[10:21.430 --> 10:23.670]  inspired me to have a midlife crisis here.
[10:27.350 --> 10:30.310]  Although I did buy a Miata convertible this spring, so...
[10:31.030 --> 10:34.150]  Note my eye roll.
[10:36.630 --> 10:41.110]  So I've been working for 20 years on willow bioenergy crops, which you can see over there.
[10:41.110 --> 10:48.230]  That's a two-year-old stand of willow. But in March, we held a hemp summit that the lieutenant
[10:48.230 --> 10:54.790]  governor attended on the campus, where she announced a $400,000 research grant to Cornell.
[10:55.750 --> 11:00.310]  And I thought that's great. We have a very strong multidisciplinary team,
[11:00.310 --> 11:04.630]  and we'll be able to get some good research done here over this year and next year.
[11:05.830 --> 11:11.510]  And we were gearing up for that, planting all these trials. And then in the beginning of June,
[11:12.070 --> 11:17.430]  the governor said, well, we need more than just a few variety trials. We need thousands of acres
[11:17.430 --> 11:22.550]  of hemp in the United States. We want to be a leader in the country in hemp production.
[11:23.510 --> 11:29.750]  And those of us on the hemp team at Cornell said, we'll do the best we can. And we started
[11:29.750 --> 11:35.670]  working together with Tim Sweeney and Jackie Shubb and Chris Loeb and Steve McGrattan at
[11:35.670 --> 11:44.070]  Ag and Markets and the commissioner. And we were able to secure a $900,000 grant through Empire
[11:44.070 --> 11:49.750]  State Development. That contract, just to give you an idea of the timeline, that contract was
[11:49.750 --> 11:59.350]  signed on June 16. Janie and her colleague, Julie Hanson in Ithaca, worked very hard with Valley
[11:59.350 --> 12:07.590]  Bio in Ontario to order more than 51,000 pounds of seed from Valley Bio of the cultivar Anka,
[12:07.590 --> 12:13.430]  which you see here in the trial. And then we worked together with Ag and Markets to
[12:14.150 --> 12:19.510]  line up growers. And some of those growers are here today. Mike Gardnier from Farm Fresh First,
[12:19.830 --> 12:29.030]  has planted nearly 600 acres of hemp. Dan Spope is here from East Amherst. And they will have
[12:29.030 --> 12:41.590]  120 acres planted here by the weekend, hopefully. And in total, we will have planted 1,700 acres
[12:41.590 --> 12:47.830]  of this variety across 25 different farm sites. So I have a handout here just summarizing that.
[12:48.790 --> 12:57.670]  Our main aim of that project is to get growers inspired and also to inspire the markets for hemp.
[12:58.550 --> 13:05.830]  And to send the message that New York is into hemp in a big way, with strong support from our
[13:05.830 --> 13:13.510]  academic institutions, Cornell and our SUNY colleagues. We will get some data on
[13:13.510 --> 13:17.670]  establishment methods, because all these growers have used different seeders.
[13:18.550 --> 13:23.190]  We stand... one thing we standardized was the seeding rate at 30 pounds per acre.
[13:23.910 --> 13:27.990]  Although we got three different seed lots, which have different germination rates.
[13:27.990 --> 13:33.910]  So that's one of the issues with hemp that Alan Taylor is going to talk about,
[13:34.710 --> 13:39.030]  is the variability in germination rates and seedling vigor.
[13:39.110 --> 13:45.270]  Some of our growers are doing some no-till planting. Some of them...
[13:46.390 --> 13:52.550]  one of our growers planted with an onion planter. Some of our growers are harvesting hemp baby
[13:52.550 --> 14:00.390]  greens, which is becoming quite an item apparently. Some of them will, I think, be able to combine
[14:00.390 --> 14:07.110]  their fields and will be able to measure yields on a fairly large scale. But some of the fields are
[14:07.110 --> 14:12.710]  still to be planted and those fields are effectively planted for cover crops at this point.
[14:14.230 --> 14:20.550]  So that's where we stand with the hemp farmer research trials. We also have
[14:21.350 --> 14:27.670]  Judd Reed from Cooperative Extension. We have a team of eight or ten folks now spread across the
[14:27.670 --> 14:34.630]  state to help support those farmers and to learn more about hemp so that we have a strong support
[14:34.630 --> 14:42.550]  network as we move forward into the future. Judd? Sure. Can you introduce yourself, Judd, or do you want me to do that for you?
[14:44.790 --> 14:48.310]  And actually after you're finished, maybe if we could just have the Extension folks that are here
[14:48.310 --> 14:53.830]  introduce themselves. Sure. Okay, thanks. Thank you, Judd. Good morning everyone. My name is Juddson Reed.
[14:53.830 --> 14:59.430]  I'm with the Cornell Cooperative Extension team called Harvest New York that tends to work at...
[14:59.990 --> 15:06.790]  look at new emerging crops, emerging markets, and do a lot of... we do a lot of work post-harvest in
[15:06.790 --> 15:13.910]  terms of analyzing value chains for New York farmers. And so industrial hemp being a new crop
[15:14.630 --> 15:21.430]  really fit into that, the type of work that we do. So a colleague of mine, Cheryl Therp,
[15:21.510 --> 15:26.070]  who works out of our Erie County office, put together a
[15:28.550 --> 15:34.550]  report, an economic report, on the potential of industrial hemp in New York state. This is
[15:34.550 --> 15:40.310]  available. It's on the table where you signed in. I encourage you to grab that on your way out today.
[15:41.670 --> 15:47.110]  What we tried to do is look at what is the potential of industrial hemp for New York
[15:47.110 --> 15:53.750]  farmers in terms of what is the return per acre. And to do that, we needed to begin to look at
[15:53.750 --> 16:00.710]  what is the yield per acre, what is the price received, what are the input costs. And
[16:01.750 --> 16:05.270]  the first thing you'll notice if you look at our report is that there's not a lot of data out there.
[16:06.390 --> 16:12.790]  Some from different provinces in Canada, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and then just a few states
[16:13.750 --> 16:19.750]  as well. Yield per acre, somewhere around a thousand pounds possibly, but I've got to believe
[16:19.750 --> 16:24.630]  that's going to be higher too if we can begin to get our seeds earlier. So that was really more of
[16:24.630 --> 16:30.150]  a regulatory issue than an agronomic issue, just getting those seeds. So I'm a little concerned
[16:30.150 --> 16:36.870]  that any data that you look at from 2017 doesn't truly reflect the total potential of the crop.
[16:37.670 --> 16:41.190]  If we were able to get this ahead of time and get it in the ground earlier,
[16:41.190 --> 16:45.270]  I imagine that that yield is going to be a lot higher. The other thing we have to look at when
[16:45.270 --> 16:49.830]  it comes to yield is what are we talking about? Are we talking about fiber? Are we talking about seed?
[16:50.390 --> 16:56.870]  What is the potential market of that seed? And that's going to influence our economics quite a bit.
[16:58.150 --> 17:02.710]  Since this is a new crop, there's a lot of interest in other potential uses of it, and
[17:03.270 --> 17:09.990]  Larry mentioned baby greens as well. So using this as a salad component, perhaps grown inside
[17:09.990 --> 17:15.750]  greenhouses. And so I know there's some commercial farmers that are looking at this now in the Mohawk
[17:15.750 --> 17:23.590]  Valley, and I think in 2018, leveraging some of the funds that the governor announced on that second
[17:24.230 --> 17:26.950]  announcement of funding, we're probably going to start looking at trialing
[17:27.830 --> 17:33.190]  hemp as a baby green inside of some greenhouses in Geneva and Ithaca. Hopefully we'll have
[17:33.270 --> 17:39.270]  production information on that soon. We also need to explore what's the legality of that,
[17:39.910 --> 17:44.550]  of growing this out as a baby green and selling it to a restaurant.
[17:45.510 --> 17:48.310]  Actually, this is the most interesting backdrop I've ever had.
[17:50.390 --> 17:55.750]  So if I grow a bunch of baby green hemp and then sell it to whatever consumer,
[17:56.470 --> 17:59.750]  that's the sort of thing we want to explore, make sure that people understand that they're
[18:00.390 --> 18:06.070]  navigating those markets properly. Anything else I should say to people I work with?
[18:09.750 --> 18:12.230]  There's production specialists here as well
[18:14.390 --> 18:17.670]  that have more agronomic knowledge. Some of those people are Mike Hunter
[18:18.230 --> 18:22.230]  from Jefferson County. I see Mike Standard someplace as well.
[18:22.390 --> 18:24.950]  Janice is here, right? Janice Degney.
[18:26.550 --> 18:29.350]  Any other production, cooperative extension people I should mention?
[18:29.350 --> 18:30.950]  And Peter's here from CCE.
[18:30.950 --> 18:32.950]  Peter Landry, that's our boss.
[18:38.950 --> 18:42.230]  So one of the things that Harvest New York wants to do is understand better
[18:42.870 --> 18:48.550]  the profitability of this crop, and to do that we need to understand what are the
[18:49.270 --> 18:54.390]  yields and prices received from New York farmers. So if you're growing hemp this year,
[18:54.390 --> 19:00.630]  you might expect to hear from Cheryl Fair, again, who I work with, or Lindsey Pascho,
[19:00.630 --> 19:03.750]  who I also work with at Harvest New York, to try to understand the market better.
[19:03.750 --> 19:10.310]  What are the prices received so that we can begin to create some transparency in the value chain?
[19:10.310 --> 19:14.790]  I think one of the real potentials for this crop is we can grow it, and probably a lot of other
[19:15.510 --> 19:19.510]  people can grow it well too, but are we going to have some sort of competitive advantage
[19:19.510 --> 19:24.870]  with locally based markets, locally New York based processors?
[19:24.870 --> 19:26.870]  It looks like there's some very good news on that.
[19:26.870 --> 19:28.870]  So I'll stop there. Chris or Larry?
[19:28.870 --> 19:30.870]  Can I ask a question?
[19:30.870 --> 19:32.870]  Sure.
[19:32.870 --> 19:36.870]  We're talking about the economics. Are you guys going to post the prices you guys
[19:36.870 --> 19:38.870]  paid for the various seeds anywhere?
[19:38.870 --> 19:40.870]  Yeah, I would say we would.
[19:40.950 --> 19:50.950]  So what we would do is probably update this document with 2017 data, as much real data as we can get from farmers, people such as themselves, as much economic data as we can get, and then update this document.
[19:50.950 --> 19:54.950]  So should I divide $900,000 by $50,000? Did you spend all $900,000 on up to a bird seed?
[19:54.950 --> 19:56.950]  That's a very good question.
[19:56.950 --> 19:58.950]  So the question is, what was that budget of the $900,000?
[19:58.950 --> 20:00.950]  I think it was $50,000.
[20:00.950 --> 20:02.950]  $50,000.
[20:02.950 --> 20:04.950]  $50,000.
[20:04.950 --> 20:06.950]  $50,000.
[20:06.950 --> 20:08.950]  $50,000.
[20:09.030 --> 20:11.030]  So what was that budget of the $900,000?
[20:11.030 --> 20:17.030]  So these growers are being compensated by the acre.
[20:17.030 --> 20:25.030]  Again, we fixed the seeding rate at 30 pounds per acre, so I gave them the exact right amount of seed for their target acreage.
[20:25.030 --> 20:31.030]  So they're being compensated $400 per acre less the cost of seed, not to exceed $50 per acre.
[20:31.030 --> 20:35.030]  So you got the seed for $2 a pound?
[20:35.110 --> 20:37.110]  We got the seed for $1.98 a pound.
[20:37.110 --> 20:39.110]  Yep, from Anka, including shipping from Ontario.
[20:39.110 --> 20:41.110]  Good job.
[20:41.110 --> 20:49.110]  So let me introduce Professor Gary Bergstrom in Plant Pathology and Plant Microbiology.
[20:49.110 --> 20:51.110]  Thanks Larry, good to see everybody this morning.
[20:51.110 --> 20:55.110]  So I'm a member of the pest team, if you will.
[20:55.110 --> 20:59.110]  And that includes Elson Shields in entomology.
[20:59.110 --> 21:01.110]  I don't think Elson could make it today.
[21:01.190 --> 21:13.190]  My laboratory is very interested in trying to look ahead to some of the infectious disease problems that we may encounter, that I'm sure we will encounter.
[21:13.190 --> 21:17.190]  Jamie Cummings here and Kevin Myers are with my group.
[21:17.190 --> 21:27.190]  And we are looking forward to working with many of you, trying to crop in commercial production to help you out with diagnosing problems.
[21:27.270 --> 21:31.270]  I attended at our professional plant pathology meetings last week.
[21:31.270 --> 21:35.270]  There was a special session on hemp and cannabis general diseases.
[21:35.270 --> 21:43.270]  And one of the things that we heard is that there's this myth that there are no pest problems on cannabis.
[21:43.270 --> 21:45.270]  And that is quite untrue.
[21:45.270 --> 21:53.270]  In fact, what I heard from colleagues in Kentucky, Indiana, and some other states that have been maybe working on this a little longer than us,
[21:53.350 --> 21:59.350]  that there's been kind of an explosion of realizing pest problems.
[21:59.350 --> 22:05.350]  And down the road, as we increase the acreage and the intensity, we will have a number of things to deal with.
[22:05.350 --> 22:09.350]  And I think as the course of the morning goes on here, if you don't know already,
[22:09.350 --> 22:15.350]  because of the status of this, is it really a crop sort of idea?
[22:15.350 --> 22:17.350]  Or is it a schedule one drug?
[22:17.430 --> 22:23.430]  Depending on which agency you're talking to, there are no registered pesticides for this crop.
[22:23.430 --> 22:31.430]  So in that sense, we're all going to be looking at organic production in at least the initial years of this.
[22:31.430 --> 22:37.430]  And so that does present some problems, some challenges to us, and we'll learn about that together.
[22:37.430 --> 22:43.430]  It means that we'll need to work on some cultural practices at the beginning, things like the sequencing of crops.
[22:43.510 --> 22:49.510]  We want to avoid crops that have a similar spectrum of diseases.
[22:49.510 --> 22:55.510]  One that we're somewhat concerned about in New York State, because of our rotations, is white mold, Sclerotinia white mold.
[22:55.510 --> 23:02.510]  Because if we're in rotation with things like soybean and a number of our vegetable crops, we already have issues with that.
[23:02.510 --> 23:06.510]  So we know that hemp's quite susceptible to that.
[23:06.590 --> 23:10.590]  And the other thing I learned from this symposium last week,
[23:10.590 --> 23:14.590]  that the spectrum of problems on the greenhouse grown, like for the baby greens,
[23:14.590 --> 23:19.590]  is almost a completely different spectrum of problems than what we encounter in production in the field.
[23:19.590 --> 23:21.590]  So we need to be attuned to that as well.
[23:21.590 --> 23:25.590]  So I'm not going to belabor a lot of Latin names with you.
[23:25.590 --> 23:30.590]  There are a number of pests that we're going to be on the lookout for.
[23:30.670 --> 23:36.670]  And just want you to know that we're here to serve and work with you on diagnosing
[23:36.670 --> 23:39.670]  and learning together how we can best manage some of those problems.
[23:39.670 --> 23:41.670]  So, thank you.
[23:41.670 --> 23:42.670]  Alan?
[23:42.670 --> 23:46.670]  Alan, you're up for introducing yourself?
[23:48.670 --> 23:54.670]  Welcome, and it's good to see quite a turnout that we have here this morning.
[23:54.750 --> 24:00.750]  We had just two weeks ago, the Henth ago, on the first hemp field day there,
[24:00.750 --> 24:02.750]  and had about an equal turnout.
[24:02.750 --> 24:09.750]  So I really appreciate the interest and curiosity on this crowd.
[24:09.750 --> 24:11.750]  So who am I?
[24:11.750 --> 24:14.750]  And it's a pleasure for me to introduce myself.
[24:14.750 --> 24:16.750]  My name's Alan Taylor.
[24:16.750 --> 24:22.750]  I'm a faculty here at the Experiment Station, professor in seed science and technology.
[24:22.830 --> 24:27.830]  So my involvement in this project is really looking at the quality aspects,
[24:27.830 --> 24:33.830]  starting from seed testing, of the different lines and varieties that we see out here,
[24:33.830 --> 24:40.830]  but also to go further into the research, applied research, of developing some seed enhancements.
[24:40.830 --> 24:43.830]  But I want to start, as we're really beginning this work,
[24:43.830 --> 24:47.830]  is really to talk about seed quality, and what does that mean,
[24:47.910 --> 24:52.910]  just again, just from the, how do we define the seed quality?
[24:52.910 --> 24:57.910]  Those of you that are not really familiar with agronomic crops and seed quality,
[24:57.910 --> 24:59.910]  there's really two components.
[24:59.910 --> 25:04.910]  One is the germination, we would all expect, obviously the seeds have to germinate.
[25:04.910 --> 25:09.910]  The second part is called purity, and the purity of the seed lot is we really just want safety.
[25:09.910 --> 25:13.910]  And when you open up that bag of anchor to plant on your farm,
[25:13.990 --> 25:17.990]  you want to just have seeds of that particular variety.
[25:17.990 --> 25:20.990]  What else could be there? There could be other crop seeds.
[25:20.990 --> 25:25.990]  There can be weed seeds, particularly noxious weed seeds may be present.
[25:25.990 --> 25:29.990]  And so if those weed seeds are there, you're also planting weed seeds in your farm.
[25:29.990 --> 25:33.990]  And then finally just inert matter, which is really just trash material, things like that.
[25:33.990 --> 25:36.990]  So there are some standards.
[25:36.990 --> 25:42.990]  First of all is how, as we've had to import seeds from all these trials,
[25:43.070 --> 25:47.070]  we're coming from two main companies, seed companies up in Canada,
[25:47.070 --> 25:50.070]  and the rest from Europe.
[25:50.070 --> 25:56.070]  Learning more about the Canadian system is there are close neighbors here to the north.
[25:56.070 --> 26:00.070]  First of all, they have to have an APHIS permit.
[26:00.070 --> 26:04.070]  An APHIS permit is very general, it just allows them to export seeds.
[26:04.070 --> 26:09.070]  There's really no specifications or requirements as far as the germination is concerned.
[26:09.150 --> 26:12.150]  A germination test is performed on the seed.
[26:12.150 --> 26:18.150]  Also noxious weeds, noxious weeds are defined by the state or the province
[26:18.150 --> 26:21.150]  to be considered harmful to agriculture.
[26:21.150 --> 26:27.150]  And the only other thing that's reported is if there's other crop seeds in excess of 5%,
[26:27.150 --> 26:29.150]  which is quite a bit of other crop seeds.
[26:29.150 --> 26:32.150]  So you say, where are these other crop seeds coming from?
[26:32.150 --> 26:37.150]  As Gary mentioned, there are no legal pesticides, and that includes herbicides.
[26:37.230 --> 26:43.230]  So the ground that that's planted on, as Michael Luce in my program is here,
[26:43.230 --> 26:48.230]  you know, there are, we found oat seeds, sunflower, buckwheat,
[26:48.230 --> 26:53.230]  a number of different contaminant other crop seeds are already present in them.
[26:53.230 --> 26:55.230]  And that's something that's really not desirable.
[26:55.230 --> 27:03.230]  So anyway, we are in a point right now of just basically of having seeds imported
[27:03.310 --> 27:08.310]  to the U.S. in particular to New York State for the production of this crop.
[27:08.310 --> 27:12.310]  Canada has some standards, I want to talk about that.
[27:12.310 --> 27:15.310]  They have a certification, we're familiar with seed certification here,
[27:15.310 --> 27:16.310]  but theirs is a little different.
[27:16.310 --> 27:20.310]  They have certification level 1, number 1, or number 2.
[27:20.310 --> 27:22.310]  So what is the criteria for that?
[27:22.310 --> 27:28.310]  So if it's a certified number 1, the seed line would have to be over 85% germination.
[27:28.310 --> 27:32.310]  It'd have to have 3 or less weed seeds present.
[27:32.390 --> 27:38.390]  And a 25 gram sample, and then less than one crop, one or more or less crop seeds.
[27:38.390 --> 27:43.390]  So 25 grams, it's about a shot full, so I think everybody can understand
[27:43.390 --> 27:46.390]  that volume of measurement of what that is.
[27:46.390 --> 27:48.390]  So those are the criteria for number 1.
[27:48.390 --> 27:53.390]  If it fails, the seed line either below germination, or if there's other,
[27:53.390 --> 27:57.390]  more weed seeds present, then the next category is their number 2.
[27:57.470 --> 28:01.470]  In that case, the germination needs to be 70% or higher.
[28:01.470 --> 28:07.470]  And then higher threshold, the number of weed seeds and the other crop seeds would be present.
[28:07.470 --> 28:12.470]  So we have 17 lots out here, I should say 17 varieties,
[28:12.470 --> 28:17.470]  but I think really a seed lot level, a seed lot level of a variety,
[28:17.470 --> 28:21.470]  as each lot can vary from one another within the same variety.
[28:21.470 --> 28:26.470]  But of the data that we've collected so far, and Michael in my laboratory,
[28:26.550 --> 28:30.550]  only 30% of those would have greater than 85% germination.
[28:30.550 --> 28:33.550]  And only about half of them over 70%.
[28:33.550 --> 28:39.550]  So you see, the quality of the seed that we're importing here can be very variable.
[28:39.550 --> 28:41.550]  We're very concerned about that.
[28:41.550 --> 28:47.550]  So having a good quality seed is very important to get it started on the right foot.
[28:47.550 --> 28:51.550]  In communication with one of the Canadian seed companies,
[28:51.630 --> 28:57.630]  again, because they're, what even they call, they're certified is not exactly what we are defined in.
[28:57.630 --> 29:02.630]  They are going to, based on our conversations, actually put on the percent germination
[29:02.630 --> 29:07.630]  in the thousand seed way. So again, things that we're used to on our seed tags,
[29:07.630 --> 29:12.630]  they do not require that, but since they are exporting, that's something that they can add.
[29:12.630 --> 29:17.630]  So I think that will be helpful for next year as we look forward.
[29:17.710 --> 29:21.710]  So again, we're focused right now on just doing the standard routine test,
[29:21.710 --> 29:24.710]  following standardized procedures.
[29:24.710 --> 29:29.710]  Any seed testing laboratory in the United States or Canada would be following the same rules.
[29:29.710 --> 29:34.710]  But from there, we're going to move forward in looking at seed quality and seed vigor aspects.
[29:34.710 --> 29:37.710]  Can we develop a practical seed vigor test?
[29:37.710 --> 29:41.710]  Especially as Jamie's talking about, under a good soil condition,
[29:41.710 --> 29:44.710]  you get a good stand. Under a cold, wet condition,
[29:44.790 --> 29:47.790]  the stand is reduced over 50%.
[29:47.790 --> 29:50.790]  So we need to better understand seed quality.
[29:50.790 --> 29:54.790]  Are there more high quality seed lots, higher vigor seed lots?
[29:54.790 --> 29:56.790]  We need to be able to identify that.
[29:56.790 --> 30:01.790]  The standard germination test simply does not have the power to resolve seed vigor.
[30:01.790 --> 30:06.790]  The other aspect is we're starting out with a fairly weak seed to begin with.
[30:06.790 --> 30:11.790]  Once they get established and growing, then they grow pretty vigorously as you can see up here.
[30:11.870 --> 30:15.870]  But it's that very early germination, early seedling establishment,
[30:15.870 --> 30:18.870]  those are the critical stages of getting them up and growing out of the ground.
[30:18.870 --> 30:23.870]  So we're interested in the seed technology tools that we're developing
[30:23.870 --> 30:27.870]  really for small seeded vegetables and also for organic production
[30:27.870 --> 30:32.870]  of seed enhancements to try to enhance, to stimulate that early seedling growth.
[30:32.870 --> 30:36.870]  But also, as we do not have any chemical seed treatments
[30:36.870 --> 30:39.870]  that we can use to control fungal diseases,
[30:39.950 --> 30:44.950]  what can we do, again, going to the organic toolbox
[30:44.950 --> 30:47.950]  and see can we use that and apply those as seed treatments.
[30:47.950 --> 30:52.950]  So I think for sake of time, if there's any questions at this time?
[30:52.950 --> 30:56.950]  Is your germination rates for these posted somewhere?
[30:56.950 --> 30:58.950]  Not at this time.
[30:58.950 --> 30:59.950]  But we will be doing that.
[30:59.950 --> 31:03.950]  We're correlating a lot of information right now in the field,
[31:03.950 --> 31:06.950]  stand establishment, and other growth parameters.
[31:07.030 --> 31:11.030]  So for all the postings, does it have to go through a whole process
[31:11.030 --> 31:12.030]  before you're able to post it?
[31:12.030 --> 31:16.030]  So is it like in the fall or can you post notes as you go?
[31:19.030 --> 31:21.030]  Chris handled that one.
[31:23.030 --> 31:25.030]  So the question was, can we post notes as we go?
[31:25.030 --> 31:27.030]  And yes we can.
[31:27.030 --> 31:30.030]  I think that incomplete data is not useful.
[31:30.030 --> 31:34.030]  So I think that if you don't have all the germ rates from all the seed lots,
[31:34.030 --> 31:36.030]  it's probably not useful to post it yet.
[31:36.110 --> 31:39.110]  But those will be posted.
[31:39.110 --> 31:42.110]  We do have a blog that Jamie Cummins is in charge of
[31:42.110 --> 31:45.110]  and Joey, sorry, Jamie Crawford.
[31:45.110 --> 31:47.110]  There's too many J's.
[31:47.110 --> 31:52.110]  And everything will be posted on the website,
[31:52.110 --> 31:55.110]  the Cornell Hemp website.
[31:55.110 --> 31:58.110]  And that will go up as soon as possible.
[31:58.110 --> 32:01.110]  The only trick is we're planning for next year.
[32:01.190 --> 32:05.190]  So even some data would be helpful
[32:05.190 --> 32:07.190]  as opposed to waiting for the,
[32:07.190 --> 32:09.190]  if it has to go through a publication process,
[32:09.190 --> 32:12.190]  which I understand has to happen for the official stuff.
[32:12.190 --> 32:15.190]  But it would be nice if there was like an informal
[32:15.190 --> 32:17.190]  update on what we're planning.
[32:17.190 --> 32:19.190]  It's time to plan for next year.
[32:19.190 --> 32:20.190]  Yeah.
[32:20.190 --> 32:23.190]  We'd be happy to have a personal conversation
[32:23.190 --> 32:26.190]  rather than posting things publicly before they're ready.
[32:26.190 --> 32:28.190]  That's exactly what I was saying.
[32:28.270 --> 32:31.270]  And sort of that's why today while we're here,
[32:31.270 --> 32:33.270]  I'll hand the microphone off to Jamie in a sec,
[32:33.270 --> 32:35.270]  but the hope is that we'll wander around
[32:35.270 --> 32:37.270]  and you'll actually be able to talk to the folks
[32:37.270 --> 32:39.270]  that have this data and get that information
[32:39.270 --> 32:41.270]  as preliminary data.
[32:41.270 --> 32:43.270]  As soon as you post something,
[32:43.270 --> 32:45.270]  someone will download it and then they won't have
[32:45.270 --> 32:46.270]  the final version.
[32:46.270 --> 32:48.270]  So that's a bit of a nervousness about posting.
[32:48.270 --> 32:49.270]  I got it.
[32:49.270 --> 32:50.270]  Thanks.
[32:50.270 --> 32:52.270]  And I also want to say you need to be a little bit careful
[32:52.270 --> 32:55.270]  because seed lot data is not the same as variety data.
[32:55.270 --> 32:56.270]  Oh, great.
[32:56.350 --> 33:00.350]  So just because, you know, we got two seed lots
[33:00.350 --> 33:03.350]  in our variety trial that were just awful,
[33:03.350 --> 33:05.350]  but it was because they were old seed lots.
[33:05.350 --> 33:07.350]  It doesn't say anything about those varieties
[33:07.350 --> 33:08.350]  in particular.
[33:08.350 --> 33:11.350]  So we need to be careful about that as well.
[33:11.350 --> 33:13.350]  Thank you.
[33:13.350 --> 33:15.350]  Chris, I have a question for Larry.
[33:15.350 --> 33:16.350]  Mm-hmm.
[33:16.350 --> 33:17.350]  Sorry, not Larry.
[33:17.350 --> 33:18.350]  Alan.
[33:18.350 --> 33:22.350]  Alan, you were talking about seed enhancements.
[33:22.350 --> 33:25.350]  You were talking about something like T22?
[33:25.430 --> 33:26.430]  Am I still okay?
[33:26.430 --> 33:27.430]  Okay.
[33:27.430 --> 33:30.430]  So the question is what are we calling seed enhancements?
[33:30.430 --> 33:32.430]  Seed enhancements is kind of a general term
[33:32.430 --> 33:34.430]  which could be the seed treatments,
[33:34.430 --> 33:37.430]  could be a beneficial seed treatment
[33:37.430 --> 33:41.430]  such as trichoderma would be as a seed treatment
[33:41.430 --> 33:45.430]  to control soil-borne pathogens, things like that.
[33:45.430 --> 33:48.430]  But we also have what we call biostimulants
[33:48.430 --> 33:51.430]  which are actually different natural plant materials
[33:51.430 --> 33:54.430]  to actually enhance the germination rate.
[33:54.510 --> 33:57.510]  And these two can kind of go in concert together.
[33:57.510 --> 34:00.510]  So the ultimate goal here is to protect
[34:00.510 --> 34:02.510]  but also to enhance the early germination
[34:02.510 --> 34:04.510]  and stand establishment.
[34:04.510 --> 34:05.510]  Good question.
[34:05.510 --> 34:08.510]  I'm very patient with that.
[34:08.510 --> 34:09.510]  I have a question.
[34:09.510 --> 34:10.510]  Yes, sir.
[34:10.510 --> 34:11.510]  Were you able to test germ rates
[34:11.510 --> 34:13.510]  for different seeding depths
[34:13.510 --> 34:15.510]  so that we can remove your contents?
[34:15.510 --> 34:16.510]  Or was it...
[34:16.510 --> 34:18.510]  It's been a while.
[34:18.510 --> 34:21.510]  The question is on seeding depth.
[34:21.590 --> 34:22.590]  Seeding depth.
[34:22.590 --> 34:23.590]  And I'll let Larry...
[34:23.590 --> 34:28.590]  So I think because we have these same varieties
[34:28.590 --> 34:30.590]  planted on six different sites,
[34:30.590 --> 34:33.590]  we'll get an idea of that consistency
[34:33.590 --> 34:36.590]  by variety across the six different sites
[34:36.590 --> 34:37.590]  or reps on each site.
[34:37.590 --> 34:40.590]  So I think we have a pretty good replication of that.
[34:45.590 --> 34:47.590]  The salad greens,
[34:47.590 --> 34:50.590]  is that being grown to hydroponic?
[34:50.590 --> 34:53.590]  The ones that I've seen are not grown hydroponic.
[34:53.670 --> 34:55.670]  They're grown in soil mix.
[34:55.670 --> 34:57.670]  Is that what you've seen as well?
[34:57.670 --> 34:58.670]  Yeah, I think...
[34:58.670 --> 35:01.670]  What we're curious about is...
[35:01.670 --> 35:03.670]  I think the first question would be
[35:03.670 --> 35:05.670]  what's the fertility approach to that?
[35:05.670 --> 35:08.670]  And if it's going to be organic inside of the greenhouse,
[35:08.670 --> 35:10.670]  that takes a little bit of finesse
[35:10.670 --> 35:12.670]  to get those fertility levels
[35:12.670 --> 35:14.670]  where they need to be,
[35:14.670 --> 35:16.670]  particularly around some nitrogen issues
[35:16.670 --> 35:19.670]  where nitrogen is not available.
[35:19.670 --> 35:21.670]  Solid food can come up very easily
[35:21.750 --> 35:24.750]  oftentimes for organic production.
[35:24.750 --> 35:26.750]  Professional feed logic.
[35:26.750 --> 35:28.750]  Are the Canadians doing much?
[35:28.750 --> 35:29.750]  Yeah.
[35:29.750 --> 35:32.750]  From the folks I've talked to,
[35:32.750 --> 35:34.750]  everything is for seed,
[35:34.750 --> 35:36.750]  predominantly for seed and some fiber,
[35:36.750 --> 35:38.750]  not greens.
[35:38.750 --> 35:39.750]  All right.
[35:39.750 --> 35:41.750]  So, Peter, did you have anything you wanted to add
[35:41.750 --> 35:43.750]  before I pass it on to Jackie?
[35:43.750 --> 35:45.750]  Okay, so Jackie...
[35:45.750 --> 35:48.750]  Are there any comments from the field,
[35:48.750 --> 35:50.750]  from the farms that you guys have visited?
[35:50.830 --> 35:52.830]  Do you want to draw?
[35:52.830 --> 35:54.830]  Weed control is an issue.
[35:54.830 --> 35:57.830]  You have to find the plants in somebody's fields.
[35:57.830 --> 35:59.830]  Every grass and brunnet you can find is there.
[35:59.830 --> 36:01.830]  Is anybody doing...
[36:01.830 --> 36:03.830]  I want to just throw in on that topic
[36:03.830 --> 36:06.830]  is that Kevin has been taking wheat counts
[36:06.830 --> 36:08.830]  in the general wheat pressure
[36:08.830 --> 36:10.830]  in the various trials,
[36:10.830 --> 36:13.830]  and it's directly correlated to that initial stand.
[36:13.830 --> 36:15.830]  So as a cultural practice,
[36:15.830 --> 36:17.830]  getting a good initial stand
[36:17.830 --> 36:19.830]  is very good from the fisheries.
[36:19.910 --> 36:21.910]  These look very good.
[36:21.910 --> 36:23.910]  I showed up today and saw these,
[36:23.910 --> 36:25.910]  and I'm like, wow,
[36:25.910 --> 36:27.910]  that's what it's supposed to look like?
[36:27.910 --> 36:29.910]  So that was Mike and Gary saying
[36:29.910 --> 36:31.910]  that weed control is definitely an issue,
[36:31.910 --> 36:33.910]  and we've seen that in some sites as well.
[36:33.910 --> 36:35.910]  And I encourage everyone,
[36:35.910 --> 36:37.910]  now that you know sort of who does what,
[36:37.910 --> 36:39.910]  that when we begin to walk around,
[36:39.910 --> 36:41.910]  you can ask folks more questions.
[36:41.910 --> 36:43.910]  So Jackie from the New York State
[36:43.910 --> 36:45.910]  Department of Ag Markets.
[36:45.910 --> 36:47.910]  Thanks, Chris.
[36:47.990 --> 36:49.990]  Good morning, everyone.
[36:49.990 --> 36:51.990]  It's very exciting for us
[36:51.990 --> 36:53.990]  to get out of the office
[36:53.990 --> 36:55.990]  and come out and see the crop in production.
[36:55.990 --> 36:57.990]  And we're very excited
[36:57.990 --> 36:59.990]  about the potential here for this crop
[36:59.990 --> 37:01.990]  as something emerging
[37:01.990 --> 37:03.990]  for New York State growers.
[37:03.990 --> 37:05.990]  And very thankful
[37:05.990 --> 37:07.990]  to Cornel,
[37:07.990 --> 37:09.990]  Larry, Chris, and the CCE team
[37:09.990 --> 37:11.990]  for helping us in this area.
[37:11.990 --> 37:13.990]  And also I'd be remiss
[37:13.990 --> 37:15.990]  if I did not mention our appreciation
[37:16.070 --> 37:18.070]  to Suni Morrisville
[37:18.070 --> 37:20.070]  who really led the way
[37:20.070 --> 37:22.070]  in a lot of what is going on
[37:22.070 --> 37:24.070]  now that we have, they were growing last year
[37:24.070 --> 37:26.070]  so we have a little bit of history,
[37:26.070 --> 37:28.070]  but not much.
[37:28.070 --> 37:30.070]  I'm the regulator that's here,
[37:30.070 --> 37:32.070]  representing the regulatory facet of this.
[37:32.070 --> 37:34.070]  This has been a very
[37:34.070 --> 37:36.070]  cumbersome,
[37:36.070 --> 37:38.070]  difficult area to navigate.
[37:38.070 --> 37:40.070]  And I also have to take
[37:40.070 --> 37:42.070]  the time to thank
[37:42.070 --> 37:44.070]  the Ag and Markets team because
[37:44.150 --> 37:46.150]  while I represent the Commissioner's office
[37:46.150 --> 37:48.150]  and the Governor,
[37:48.150 --> 37:50.150]  I've got a great group of people
[37:50.150 --> 37:52.150]  and the Commissioner has a great group of people behind him
[37:52.150 --> 37:54.150]  and working on this.
[37:54.150 --> 37:56.150]  Tim Sweeney is here
[37:56.150 --> 37:58.150]  who's a special assistant who works
[37:58.150 --> 38:00.150]  and is now targeting
[38:00.150 --> 38:02.150]  industrial hemp.
[38:02.150 --> 38:04.150]  Many of you know Chris Logue, our division director
[38:04.150 --> 38:06.150]  of plant industry.
[38:06.150 --> 38:08.150]  He is up to here in it.
[38:08.150 --> 38:10.150]  And then, absolutely,
[38:10.150 --> 38:12.150]  while you don't see them,
[38:12.230 --> 38:14.230]  they are very essential
[38:14.230 --> 38:16.230]  and that is our Council's office.
[38:16.230 --> 38:18.230]  To start out,
[38:18.230 --> 38:20.230]  we all need to know that the 2014
[38:20.230 --> 38:22.230]  federal farm bill
[38:22.230 --> 38:24.230]  provides or gives authority
[38:24.230 --> 38:26.230]  to state departments of agriculture
[38:26.230 --> 38:28.230]  and educational institutions
[38:28.230 --> 38:30.230]  to conduct agricultural
[38:30.230 --> 38:32.230]  research projects on industrial hemp.
[38:32.230 --> 38:34.230]  And I have to emphasize the word
[38:34.230 --> 38:36.230]  research.
[38:36.230 --> 38:38.230]  New York State and the legislature
[38:38.230 --> 38:40.230]  and the Governor signed a couple pieces of legislation
[38:40.310 --> 38:42.310]  putting laws
[38:42.310 --> 38:44.310]  into place that allowed us
[38:44.310 --> 38:46.310]  to move forward with pilot programs
[38:46.310 --> 38:48.310]  that allow us
[38:48.310 --> 38:50.310]  to grow, process,
[38:50.310 --> 38:52.310]  and sell products
[38:52.310 --> 38:54.310]  from those research projects.
[38:54.310 --> 38:56.310]  And much of what you've heard here
[38:56.310 --> 38:58.310]  this morning is our
[38:58.310 --> 39:00.310]  partnership with Cornell
[39:00.310 --> 39:02.310]  initially with the $400,000
[39:02.310 --> 39:04.310]  to do these preliminary research trials
[39:04.310 --> 39:06.310]  but then to take it out in the field
[39:06.310 --> 39:08.310]  and start gathering some agronomic data
[39:08.390 --> 39:10.390]  on farms across New York.
[39:12.390 --> 39:14.390]  I have to emphasize that
[39:14.390 --> 39:16.390]  it is the grower's
[39:16.390 --> 39:18.390]  responsibility to identify a seed
[39:18.390 --> 39:20.390]  source. International
[39:20.390 --> 39:22.390]  seed must be obtained
[39:22.390 --> 39:24.390]  through a DEA
[39:24.390 --> 39:26.390]  authorized source.
[39:26.390 --> 39:28.390]  At the Governor's direction,
[39:28.390 --> 39:30.390]  the department is
[39:30.390 --> 39:32.390]  working towards getting a DEA
[39:32.390 --> 39:34.390]  permit where we will be able,
[39:34.390 --> 39:36.390]  once it's in place, to facilitate
[39:36.470 --> 39:38.470]  seed coming into the state
[39:38.470 --> 39:40.470]  from international sources.
[39:40.470 --> 39:42.470]  We are in the process of that.
[39:42.470 --> 39:44.470]  We have been in the process for quite a while on that.
[39:44.470 --> 39:46.470]  And we're hopeful
[39:46.470 --> 39:48.470]  to get that in place so that
[39:48.470 --> 39:50.470]  we can go out with a solicitation
[39:50.470 --> 39:52.470]  hopefully
[39:52.470 --> 39:54.470]  towards the fall with enough time
[39:54.470 --> 39:56.470]  that farmers that are interested,
[39:56.470 --> 39:58.470]  farmers and businesses that are interested
[39:58.470 --> 40:00.470]  in doing a research project
[40:00.470 --> 40:02.470]  can research, identify a seed source
[40:02.470 --> 40:04.470]  and then
[40:04.550 --> 40:06.550]  we would work with them to facilitate
[40:06.550 --> 40:08.550]  it getting to the farms
[40:08.550 --> 40:10.550]  and to the businesses.
[40:10.550 --> 40:12.550]  So we are in the process of that.
[40:12.550 --> 40:14.550]  Stay tuned. As I said, we're hoping
[40:14.550 --> 40:16.550]  to do a solicitation or
[40:16.550 --> 40:18.550]  to look for some more research projects
[40:18.550 --> 40:20.550]  this fall.
[40:22.550 --> 40:24.550]  On the seed front,
[40:24.550 --> 40:26.550]  we are focusing
[40:26.550 --> 40:28.550]  our efforts internally on
[40:28.550 --> 40:30.550]  the need
[40:30.550 --> 40:32.550]  for good, viable seed. You've heard a lot
[40:32.630 --> 40:34.630]  of conversations about that
[40:34.630 --> 40:36.630]  here this morning.
[40:36.630 --> 40:38.630]  We're looking at our seed lab to
[40:38.630 --> 40:40.630]  maybe run some tests on
[40:40.630 --> 40:42.630]  some of those things that
[40:42.630 --> 40:44.630]  Alan has mentioned
[40:44.630 --> 40:46.630]  as far as germination, inert, etc.
[40:46.630 --> 40:48.630]  We're also
[40:48.630 --> 40:50.630]  looking, and was one of the
[40:50.630 --> 40:52.630]  initiatives underway, it'll take us a little
[40:52.630 --> 40:54.630]  time, but a seed certification
[40:54.630 --> 40:56.630]  program in New York State in this area.
[40:58.630 --> 41:00.630]  One of the big things,
[41:00.710 --> 41:02.710]  I forgot to mention it,
[41:02.710 --> 41:04.710]  is this program initially
[41:04.710 --> 41:06.710]  started out with
[41:06.710 --> 41:08.710]  ten sites that were authorized
[41:08.710 --> 41:10.710]  by state law.
[41:10.710 --> 41:12.710]  We as an agency
[41:12.710 --> 41:14.710]  decided to start out with educational
[41:14.710 --> 41:16.710]  institutions with those
[41:16.710 --> 41:18.710]  ten and had four of those
[41:18.710 --> 41:20.710]  institutions come forward, Cornell
[41:20.710 --> 41:22.710]  being one.
[41:22.710 --> 41:24.710]  Then we looked to
[41:24.710 --> 41:26.710]  the tremendous interest in
[41:26.710 --> 41:28.710]  getting growers involved and businesses involved.
[41:28.790 --> 41:30.790]  We expanded those ten to private
[41:30.790 --> 41:32.790]  businesses and farms.
[41:32.790 --> 41:34.790]  The governor of state of state came out and said,
[41:34.790 --> 41:36.790]  no, we're opening this up.
[41:36.790 --> 41:38.790]  We need to be growing
[41:38.790 --> 41:40.790]  looking at this crop beyond
[41:40.790 --> 41:42.790]  ten sites. So we do
[41:42.790 --> 41:44.790]  have the ability to
[41:44.790 --> 41:46.790]  expand the program
[41:46.790 --> 41:48.790]  and
[41:48.790 --> 41:50.790]  look at other
[41:50.790 --> 41:52.790]  research projects. We have a
[41:52.790 --> 41:54.790]  working, we also announced
[41:54.790 --> 41:56.790]  an industrial hemp working
[41:56.870 --> 41:58.870]  group which is coming together. We hope to
[41:58.870 --> 42:00.870]  have discussions about
[42:00.870 --> 42:02.870]  where the areas of need
[42:02.870 --> 42:04.870]  are in the research
[42:04.870 --> 42:06.870]  arena so that they can help
[42:06.870 --> 42:08.870]  guide the agency
[42:08.870 --> 42:10.870]  as to what kind of projects we look for.
[42:10.870 --> 42:12.870]  And we're also
[42:12.870 --> 42:14.870]  on the processing end
[42:14.870 --> 42:16.870]  looking for
[42:16.870 --> 42:18.870]  a rolling
[42:18.870 --> 42:20.870]  kind of application.
[42:20.870 --> 42:22.870]  We're considering a rolling application
[42:22.870 --> 42:24.870]  for processors versus a
[42:24.950 --> 42:26.950]  full time frame where the grower
[42:26.950 --> 42:28.950]  wants, you'll have an application
[42:28.950 --> 42:30.950]  period.
[42:30.950 --> 42:32.950]  We're also investigating
[42:32.950 --> 42:34.950]  just a processor license
[42:34.950 --> 42:36.950]  just to know
[42:36.950 --> 42:38.950]  where the processors are,
[42:38.950 --> 42:40.950]  where the potential markets
[42:40.950 --> 42:42.950]  are for the product so that they are on
[42:42.950 --> 42:44.950]  our radar screen.
[42:44.950 --> 42:46.950]  There's also
[42:46.950 --> 42:48.950]  through partnering with
[42:48.950 --> 42:50.950]  Empire State Development,
[42:50.950 --> 42:52.950]  they've come out with processing grants
[42:53.030 --> 42:55.030]  up to $500,000 for
[42:55.030 --> 42:57.030]  processing grants. And we're also
[42:57.030 --> 42:59.030]  working, having
[42:59.030 --> 43:01.030]  some initial conversations with the
[43:01.030 --> 43:03.030]  Department of Health with respect to any of
[43:03.030 --> 43:05.030]  the food
[43:05.030 --> 43:07.030]  supplement
[43:07.030 --> 43:09.030]  areas. So that's
[43:09.030 --> 43:11.030]  all in the open, having some conversations
[43:11.030 --> 43:13.030]  there. I think that
[43:13.030 --> 43:15.030]  is, oh also we, our
[43:15.030 --> 43:17.030]  regulations that are in place, currently
[43:17.030 --> 43:19.030]  this program started out with
[43:19.030 --> 43:21.030]  educational institutions, our regulations
[43:21.110 --> 43:23.110]  that are on the books solely
[43:23.110 --> 43:25.110]  pertain to educational
[43:25.110 --> 43:27.110]  institutions. The other
[43:27.110 --> 43:29.110]  entities that are involved in this program
[43:29.110 --> 43:31.110]  have been operating under department guidance
[43:31.110 --> 43:33.110]  and partnership
[43:33.110 --> 43:35.110]  agreements with the agency.
[43:35.110 --> 43:37.110]  We are looking to
[43:37.110 --> 43:39.110]  move that
[43:39.110 --> 43:41.110]  arena into some kind
[43:41.110 --> 43:43.110]  of regulatory framework
[43:43.110 --> 43:45.110]  and while we're looking
[43:45.110 --> 43:47.110]  at the regulations, we are
[43:47.110 --> 43:49.110]  trying to minimize them. So we initially
[43:49.190 --> 43:51.190]  came out with a program that had a lot
[43:51.190 --> 43:53.190]  of checks, checking
[43:53.190 --> 43:55.190]  the boxes, making sure. I think we're
[43:55.190 --> 43:57.190]  feeling much more comfortable
[43:57.190 --> 43:59.190]  with the program and so
[43:59.190 --> 44:01.190]  we would be
[44:01.190 --> 44:03.190]  making, potentially making regulatory changes
[44:03.190 --> 44:05.190]  that lightened up
[44:05.190 --> 44:07.190]  on the regulations
[44:07.190 --> 44:09.190]  that are in place and
[44:09.190 --> 44:11.190]  also bringing the,
[44:11.190 --> 44:13.190]  putting those guidance into regulations.
[44:13.190 --> 44:15.190]  And that's really for the protection
[44:15.190 --> 44:17.190]  of everyone involved
[44:17.270 --> 44:19.270]  in this county. It's still a
[44:19.270 --> 44:21.270]  schedule one
[44:21.270 --> 44:23.270]  drug so everyone
[44:23.270 --> 44:25.270]  needs to keep that at the top of their mind
[44:25.270 --> 44:27.270]  when they're exploring it.
[44:27.270 --> 44:29.270]  So I think that's it. Tim, did I miss anything?
[44:29.270 --> 44:31.270]  Just the guidance documents being updated
[44:31.270 --> 44:33.270]  and that should be released
[44:33.270 --> 44:35.270]  along with the new application
[44:35.270 --> 44:37.270]  period.
[44:37.270 --> 44:39.270]  Is that still targeted for them
[44:39.270 --> 44:41.270]  in August?
[44:41.270 --> 44:43.270]  The release of that in June,
[44:43.270 --> 44:45.270]  for me? The, I think
[44:45.350 --> 44:47.350]  we're waiting, we're somewhat sitting
[44:47.350 --> 44:49.350]  tight because we'd like to get the DEA
[44:49.350 --> 44:51.350]  permit. So that's really where we are
[44:51.350 --> 44:53.350]  as an agency. We're trying to get the
[44:53.350 --> 44:55.350]  DEA permit.
[44:55.350 --> 44:57.350]  We have communication
[44:57.350 --> 44:59.350]  probably that has been
[44:59.350 --> 45:01.350]  two weeks. We gotta be a little,
[45:01.350 --> 45:03.350]  don't wanna hound them too much. It's a
[45:03.350 --> 45:05.350]  fine line. It's a very fine line.
[45:05.350 --> 45:07.350]  So we're navigating it. We are very diligent.
[45:07.350 --> 45:09.350]  I mean this is coming from the top.
[45:09.350 --> 45:11.350]  This is something that
[45:11.350 --> 45:13.350]  the agency is
[45:13.430 --> 45:15.430]  involved in in a very big way.
[45:15.430 --> 45:17.430]  But it is complicated
[45:17.430 --> 45:19.430]  and I think we've done a
[45:19.430 --> 45:21.430]  pretty good job so far.
[45:21.430 --> 45:23.430]  Everybody involved has been
[45:23.430 --> 45:25.430]  a huge undertaking.
[45:25.430 --> 45:27.430]  You guys have been awesome.
[45:27.430 --> 45:29.430]  I mean I love it.
[45:29.430 --> 45:31.430]  It's one of the best partnerships.
[45:31.430 --> 45:33.430]  Can you give us a little bit on
[45:33.430 --> 45:35.430]  you're gonna have a large volume
[45:35.430 --> 45:37.430]  of testing with this 2,000 acres in there.
[45:37.430 --> 45:39.430]  Can you give us a little bit on the state of readiness
[45:39.430 --> 45:41.430]  when you start taking our THC tests?
[45:41.510 --> 45:43.510]  I would have,
[45:43.510 --> 45:45.510]  unfortunately I don't have Chris here with me.
[45:45.510 --> 45:47.510]  But I know he has a plan.
[45:47.510 --> 45:49.510]  I think some of it's gonna
[45:49.510 --> 45:51.510]  be, maybe I
[45:51.510 --> 45:53.510]  don't know if I should even venture there, but I think it has to do
[45:53.510 --> 45:55.510]  with the source of seed
[45:55.510 --> 45:57.510]  and comfort level there.
[45:57.510 --> 45:59.510]  We have
[45:59.510 --> 46:01.510]  to make sure that's another issue
[46:01.510 --> 46:03.510]  that we're working through is lab capacity
[46:03.510 --> 46:05.510]  and I think that is a huge issue.
[46:05.510 --> 46:07.510]  And we are,
[46:07.510 --> 46:09.510]  all I can say is we're aware of that.
[46:09.590 --> 46:11.590]  We are working every day on that
[46:11.590 --> 46:13.590]  issue of the capability
[46:13.590 --> 46:15.590]  for the regulatory
[46:15.590 --> 46:17.590]  agency to pull our regulatory
[46:17.590 --> 46:19.590]  samples
[46:19.590 --> 46:21.590]  and then you have the whole
[46:21.590 --> 46:23.590]  kind of service sector that's out there
[46:23.590 --> 46:25.590]  that growers that want to have their
[46:25.590 --> 46:27.590]  crop tested and that's a whole
[46:27.590 --> 46:29.590]  other arena. So we're aware of it.
[46:29.590 --> 46:31.590]  THC
[46:31.590 --> 46:33.590]  Is it ok to send it out state?
[46:33.590 --> 46:35.590]  You cannot send it out of state.
[46:35.590 --> 46:37.590]  That's the, you know, it's moving across
[46:37.670 --> 46:39.670]  state lines.
[46:39.670 --> 46:41.670]  To all of that at your own risk.
[46:41.670 --> 46:43.670]  Just don't do it.
[46:43.670 --> 46:45.670]  Just to answer your question a little bit,
[46:45.670 --> 46:47.670]  Mark, we do
[46:47.670 --> 46:49.670]  have cooperation with our
[46:49.670 --> 46:51.670]  Institute of Biotechnology on the
[46:51.670 --> 46:53.670]  Ithaca campus to test
[46:53.670 --> 46:55.670]  all the samples from the six trials, all
[46:55.670 --> 46:57.670]  17 varieties for the full
[46:57.670 --> 46:59.670]  cannabinoid spectrum
[46:59.670 --> 47:01.670]  of compounds. And then
[47:01.670 --> 47:03.670]  again in talking with Chris Logue
[47:03.670 --> 47:05.670]  because ANCA is a certified
[47:05.750 --> 47:07.750]  cultivar in Canada.
[47:07.750 --> 47:09.750]  Our concerns about that are
[47:09.750 --> 47:11.750]  a little bit less.
[47:11.750 --> 47:13.750]  Do you test only the cannabinoid profiles
[47:13.750 --> 47:15.750]  or do you test flavonoid profiles?
[47:15.750 --> 47:17.750]  Oh, that's a good question.
[47:17.750 --> 47:19.750]  So
[47:19.750 --> 47:21.750]  I've been the one that's been talking to
[47:21.750 --> 47:23.750]  Joss Rose who is the head of our
[47:23.750 --> 47:25.750]  metabolomics facilities at Cornell.
[47:25.750 --> 47:27.750]  He's a plant biologist
[47:27.750 --> 47:29.750]  in the School of Plant Sciences
[47:29.750 --> 47:31.750]  and he said that
[47:31.750 --> 47:33.750]  to start with they're planning
[47:33.830 --> 47:35.830]  to do the
[47:35.830 --> 47:37.830]  cannabidiol
[47:37.830 --> 47:39.830]  panel. So more than
[47:39.830 --> 47:41.830]  just the CBDs, a more
[47:41.830 --> 47:43.830]  broad panel because a lot of folks are gonna
[47:43.830 --> 47:45.830]  want to know what all is available.
[47:45.830 --> 47:47.830]  And that's not a
[47:47.830 --> 47:49.830]  regulatory issue, that's just an
[47:49.830 --> 47:51.830]  informational component.
[47:51.830 --> 47:53.830]  And then
[47:53.830 --> 47:55.830]  once we determine
[47:55.830 --> 47:57.830]  based on standards how well
[47:57.830 --> 47:59.830]  we can do, then we'll be able
[47:59.830 --> 48:01.830]  to provide a better idea of
[48:01.910 --> 48:03.910]  the breadth of testing that can be done.
[48:05.910 --> 48:07.910]  And actually
[48:07.910 --> 48:09.910]  there'll actually also be a protocol
[48:09.910 --> 48:11.910]  for exactly how the samples
[48:11.910 --> 48:13.910]  are collected in the field for that
[48:13.910 --> 48:15.910]  testing. And our protocol will be
[48:15.910 --> 48:17.910]  identical to that
[48:17.910 --> 48:19.910]  Ag and Markets is using.
[48:19.910 --> 48:21.910]  And I know Chris and his team
[48:21.910 --> 48:23.910]  are working, I know with
[48:23.910 --> 48:25.910]  Wadsworth, Department of Health Wadsworth
[48:25.910 --> 48:27.910]  we had a conversation with Chris
[48:27.910 --> 48:29.910]  Smart here as to how
[48:29.990 --> 48:31.990]  to achieve that consistency
[48:31.990 --> 48:33.990]  while we have participated
[48:33.990 --> 48:35.990]  and gone to other parts of the country to see
[48:35.990 --> 48:37.990]  how the samples should be taken.
[48:37.990 --> 48:39.990]  Once that protocol is determined
[48:39.990 --> 48:41.990]  we will then be
[48:41.990 --> 48:43.990]  doing outreach to our Hort inspectors
[48:43.990 --> 48:45.990]  a few key Hort inspectors that
[48:45.990 --> 48:47.990]  will be responsible for pulling the samples.
[48:51.990 --> 48:53.990]  Thanks Chris.
[48:53.990 --> 48:55.990]  Do you have any expectations at the federal level
[48:55.990 --> 48:57.990]  for the next bundle?
[48:58.070 --> 49:00.070]  No.
[49:02.070 --> 49:04.070]  I think it's on our radar
[49:04.070 --> 49:06.070]  state, it's definitely, I don't want to put
[49:06.070 --> 49:08.070]  words in anyone's mouth, but
[49:08.070 --> 49:10.070]  the governor is aware, the commissioner is very
[49:10.070 --> 49:12.070]  aware of this issue
[49:12.070 --> 49:14.070]  and we understand that there's at least a foot in the door
[49:14.070 --> 49:16.070]  in the farm bill with industrial hemp.
[49:18.070 --> 49:20.070]  But there is a bill introduced in Congress now
[49:20.070 --> 49:22.070]  to relax some of the
[49:22.070 --> 49:24.070]  regulations, right?
[49:24.070 --> 49:26.070]  You know, that made me think of something.
[49:26.150 --> 49:28.150]  The whole thing we're working under
[49:28.150 --> 49:30.150]  doesn't sunset with the 2014, right?
[49:30.150 --> 49:32.150]  It doesn't have to be reauthorized
[49:32.150 --> 49:34.150]  or does it?
[49:34.150 --> 49:36.150]  I don't know.
[49:36.150 --> 49:38.150]  I don't know.
[49:38.150 --> 49:40.150]  I don't either.
[49:40.150 --> 49:42.150]  We'll have to check that.
[49:42.150 --> 49:44.150]  We're just starting to look as a whole
[49:44.150 --> 49:46.150]  as an agency
[49:46.150 --> 49:48.150]  at the farm bill and starting to have
[49:48.150 --> 49:50.150]  discussions and listening sessions
[49:50.150 --> 49:52.150]  we're starting to want to hear from folks.
[49:52.150 --> 49:54.150]  So, point person
[49:54.230 --> 49:56.230]  on, I would guess, on
[49:56.230 --> 49:58.230]  federal farm bill who I work closely
[49:58.230 --> 50:00.230]  with in the commissioner's office would
[50:00.230 --> 50:02.230]  be Jeff Palmer.
[50:02.230 --> 50:04.230]  So, what we would
[50:04.230 --> 50:06.230]  love to do now is have everyone
[50:06.230 --> 50:08.230]  just sort of go out and wander through the
[50:08.230 --> 50:10.230]  field. If you have questions on C
[50:10.230 --> 50:12.230]  for Alan, on diseases for Perry
[50:12.230 --> 50:14.230]  and his team, the Mike's
[50:14.230 --> 50:16.230]  and Janice have been out
[50:16.230 --> 50:18.230]  in the field so you can get ideas from them.
[50:18.230 --> 50:20.230]  So, please just interact with us.
[50:20.230 --> 50:22.230]  Ask us any questions you have
[50:22.310 --> 50:24.310]  and enjoy
[50:24.310 --> 50:26.310]  the hemp.
