[00:00.000 --> 00:06.140]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:06.140 --> 00:07.060]  Thanks a lot, Brennan.
[00:07.060 --> 00:09.940]  I'd like to thank all the grad students for organizing this.
[00:09.940 --> 00:13.580]  It is a real honor to be invited by the grad students, which
[00:13.580 --> 00:16.740]  is a good indication that their memories of my plant breeding
[00:16.740 --> 00:19.140]  40-30 lectures is fading away.
[00:19.140 --> 00:26.820]  So I think we've got the sound issues worked out here.
[00:26.820 --> 00:31.580]  But if you're having trouble on Zoom, just send a chat.
[00:31.580 --> 00:34.700]  And Kevin here will give me the hi sign.
[00:34.700 --> 00:36.260]  And welcome, John Mahoney.
[00:36.260 --> 00:38.700]  It's good to see you again.
[00:38.700 --> 00:42.900]  My former summer scholar who's a grad student at UConn.
[00:42.900 --> 00:44.100]  Maybe future postdoc.
[00:44.100 --> 00:44.620]  We'll see.
[00:47.780 --> 00:50.140]  So I'm going to talk about our hemp breeding program.
[00:50.140 --> 00:53.420]  And I want to highlight here at the beginning
[00:53.420 --> 00:57.300]  that I do have a grad student and postdoc working
[00:57.300 --> 00:58.140]  on this project now.
[00:58.140 --> 01:00.900]  So Jacob, who's here, who started in the fall.
[01:00.900 --> 01:07.140]  And Craig Carlson, who did his PhD in my lab and is online.
[01:07.140 --> 01:08.700]  But they only started in the fall.
[01:08.700 --> 01:10.820]  And we've been doing this for about two years now.
[01:10.820 --> 01:14.460]  So a lot of the work has been done by our technical staff.
[01:14.460 --> 01:16.980]  So I really need to highlight a lot of work
[01:16.980 --> 01:20.980]  that was done by Jamie Crawford and Julie
[01:20.980 --> 01:23.100]  Hanson in Don Byan's lab.
[01:23.100 --> 01:26.980]  And Rebecca Wilk, who is my lead technician.
[01:31.460 --> 01:35.300]  So I'm going to start with a little background
[01:35.300 --> 01:37.500]  about cannabis.
[01:37.500 --> 01:40.740]  And let me just say, there's a dual meaning in my title
[01:40.740 --> 01:44.020]  from gray area to gold rush.
[01:44.020 --> 01:48.100]  It's not only referring to the economic situation
[01:48.100 --> 01:51.260]  and the interest in cannabis right now.
[01:51.260 --> 01:56.740]  But it also refers to the scientific situation.
[01:56.740 --> 01:59.420]  So a lot of the information about cannabis
[01:59.420 --> 02:01.060]  is in a gray area.
[02:01.060 --> 02:04.620]  It's on websites that I probably shouldn't be navigating
[02:04.620 --> 02:05.820]  to on the Cornell network.
[02:08.860 --> 02:13.220]  And now that hemp is legal and cannabis overall
[02:13.220 --> 02:17.300]  is fully legal in Canada, there is a real gold rush
[02:17.300 --> 02:19.660]  for scientists.
[02:19.660 --> 02:23.940]  We learn new things every day about cannabis
[02:23.940 --> 02:27.540]  because there's been very little research on cannabis.
[02:27.580 --> 02:29.980]  So it's really important to make this point clear
[02:29.980 --> 02:32.340]  from the outset.
[02:32.340 --> 02:35.380]  There are some disputes about the botany of cannabis,
[02:35.380 --> 02:39.940]  that there are three species or three subspecies, Indica,
[02:39.940 --> 02:42.900]  sativa, and ruderalis.
[02:42.900 --> 02:44.660]  They've been interbred at this point.
[02:44.660 --> 02:49.860]  And we don't really have access to the native land races.
[02:49.860 --> 02:55.500]  So I'm just going to call it cannabis sativa.
[02:55.500 --> 02:59.860]  The real distinction between marijuana and hemp
[02:59.860 --> 03:04.380]  is a legal one, the level of THC.
[03:04.380 --> 03:09.180]  So hemp, cannabis sativa has been bred for hemp
[03:09.180 --> 03:15.060]  to produce grain fiber and now CBD with a percentage of THC
[03:15.060 --> 03:18.900]  below 0.3, while marijuana has been bred
[03:18.900 --> 03:21.660]  to produce high levels of THC.
[03:21.660 --> 03:25.060]  So really, they are the products of breeding.
[03:25.140 --> 03:29.140]  But the legal definition, which is really important for growers
[03:29.140 --> 03:32.780]  and for regulators and for law enforcement,
[03:32.780 --> 03:40.050]  refers to the level of THC, not really the botany.
[03:40.050 --> 03:43.130]  So we grew a lot of hemp in this country.
[03:43.130 --> 03:46.890]  In this area, we grew a lot of hemp during colonial days.
[03:46.890 --> 03:50.850]  Hemp could actually be used to pay your taxes to the king.
[03:50.850 --> 03:53.970]  And that hemp was used to make rope and sailcloth
[03:54.010 --> 03:56.690]  for the British Navy.
[03:56.690 --> 03:58.490]  We also used it during wartime.
[03:58.490 --> 04:02.850]  So the biggest hemp cultivation in the US was in 1943.
[04:02.850 --> 04:07.690]  And you see here, I think we have to trust the USDA statistics.
[04:10.730 --> 04:17.490]  About 180,000, 200,000 acres of hemp grown in 1943.
[04:17.490 --> 04:23.490]  And if you look at the states that are involved here,
[04:23.490 --> 04:27.930]  this was Wisconsin early on, Kentucky, Illinois,
[04:27.930 --> 04:30.650]  Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana.
[04:30.650 --> 04:32.370]  Those were the main states.
[04:32.370 --> 04:35.370]  OK?
[04:35.370 --> 04:41.970]  It was largely illegal or very difficult to grow after 1937.
[04:41.970 --> 04:46.130]  There was a tax that was imposed on cannabis that essentially
[04:46.130 --> 04:48.210]  made it too expensive to grow.
[04:48.210 --> 04:51.810]  And then the Controlled Substance Act in 1971
[04:51.810 --> 04:56.690]  made cannabis illegal to grow overall.
[04:56.690 --> 05:00.450]  In 2014, though, in the Farm Bill,
[05:00.450 --> 05:03.210]  there were provisions enacted to allow
[05:03.210 --> 05:06.930]  pilot programs authorized by states
[05:06.930 --> 05:10.170]  to grow hemp for research.
[05:10.170 --> 05:13.450]  And that could be agronomic research.
[05:13.450 --> 05:18.290]  New York interpreted it to also include market research.
[05:18.290 --> 05:23.210]  So New York approved its pilot program in late 2015.
[05:23.210 --> 05:27.050]  And Cornell got its grower's license.
[05:27.050 --> 05:32.170]  We got license number two in the state in early 2016.
[05:32.170 --> 05:34.970]  And we started cultivating hemp at the end of that growing
[05:34.970 --> 05:35.490]  season.
[05:38.250 --> 05:40.610]  So here's the interesting situation,
[05:40.610 --> 05:46.010]  is that we have a reasonable market for hemp products.
[05:46.050 --> 05:47.090]  It's not a huge market.
[05:47.090 --> 05:50.970]  In 2017, $820 million.
[05:50.970 --> 05:52.770]  It's a very diverse market, as you see.
[05:52.770 --> 05:55.930]  But at that time, all of the hemp products
[05:55.930 --> 05:59.890]  were being imported because we didn't grow any hemp, really.
[05:59.890 --> 06:04.010]  So $105 million market for textiles,
[06:04.010 --> 06:05.770]  entirely coming from China.
[06:05.770 --> 06:10.650]  And Patagonia has a pretty good line of hemp clothing
[06:10.650 --> 06:12.530]  that you can purchase.
[06:12.530 --> 06:16.210]  There's a huge market for hemp seed oil incorporated
[06:16.210 --> 06:17.890]  into personal care products.
[06:17.890 --> 06:20.490]  Lotion, soaps, lip balm.
[06:20.490 --> 06:24.290]  So that picture is products made in New York.
[06:24.290 --> 06:26.850]  Soap, and a deodorant, and a lip balm.
[06:26.850 --> 06:28.290]  And then there are very interesting
[06:28.290 --> 06:30.410]  industrial applications.
[06:30.410 --> 06:33.250]  That's a picture of a hemp insulation that
[06:33.250 --> 06:35.410]  could be a replacement for fiberglass wall
[06:35.410 --> 06:41.130]  insulation made by a company in Louisville, Kentucky.
[06:41.130 --> 06:43.570]  It's also a fantastic food product.
[06:43.570 --> 06:46.010]  So the grain goes into granola.
[06:46.010 --> 06:50.450]  So that Evoke is a granola product made in Rochester.
[06:50.450 --> 06:53.690]  And Genesee Brewery has just announced three flavors of beer
[06:53.690 --> 06:57.250]  that they're going to make from hemp grain.
[06:57.250 --> 07:01.850]  So very diverse market opportunities.
[07:01.850 --> 07:04.730]  Up until now, entirely supplied by hemp,
[07:04.730 --> 07:06.730]  imported into this country.
[07:06.730 --> 07:11.090]  That's why legislators were so interested in legalizing hemp
[07:11.250 --> 07:15.730]  Why don't we just grow it here and fully market
[07:15.730 --> 07:18.290]  the opportunities here?
[07:18.290 --> 07:22.050]  Now, the big opportunity and the big explosion, the gold rush,
[07:22.050 --> 07:25.650]  is in CBD, cannabidiol, a compound.
[07:25.650 --> 07:28.730]  We'll talk about the biochemistry a little bit later.
[07:28.730 --> 07:32.130]  In the same biosynthetic pathway as THC,
[07:32.130 --> 07:35.730]  but very different pharmacological activity.
[07:35.730 --> 07:38.690]  So it has been approved as a medicine.
[07:38.690 --> 07:41.730]  Very effective treatment for childhood epilepsy,
[07:41.730 --> 07:44.770]  reducing daily seizures for children with Trouvette
[07:44.770 --> 07:50.330]  syndrome from 25 to 30 seizures a day down to maybe one or two.
[07:50.330 --> 07:53.250]  So very effective for epilepsy.
[07:53.250 --> 07:55.450]  And then a lot of anecdotal data.
[07:55.450 --> 07:58.770]  So this market is spreading through word of mouth
[07:58.770 --> 08:02.730]  that it is effective for other neuromuscular symptoms,
[08:02.730 --> 08:05.490]  muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease,
[08:05.490 --> 08:07.730]  restless leg syndrome.
[08:07.770 --> 08:09.290]  It's also effective against anxiety.
[08:11.890 --> 08:16.570]  And there are good animal studies with anxious mice.
[08:16.570 --> 08:17.730]  They become less anxious.
[08:21.290 --> 08:23.450]  And it helps people sleep.
[08:23.450 --> 08:26.690]  It also seems to be very effective for chronic pain.
[08:26.690 --> 08:29.850]  So actually, in the medical marijuana programs,
[08:29.850 --> 08:32.050]  the most common prescribed product
[08:32.050 --> 08:35.770]  is a 50-50 mixture of CBD and THC.
[08:35.770 --> 08:39.490]  The CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC
[08:39.490 --> 08:43.770]  and provides a broader spectrum of pharmacological benefits.
[08:46.770 --> 08:51.330]  So that market is estimated to grow to potentially $2 billion
[08:51.330 --> 08:52.210]  in 2020.
[08:52.210 --> 08:58.130]  It may already be at $2 billion, and $22 billion by 2022.
[08:58.130 --> 09:01.530]  So 90% of the hemp growers in the country
[09:01.530 --> 09:05.410]  are growing to produce CBD.
[09:05.570 --> 09:08.570]  So here's the other aspect of the gold rush.
[09:08.570 --> 09:11.530]  The acreage has expanded, has tripled every year
[09:11.530 --> 09:13.570]  for the last three years.
[09:13.570 --> 09:16.610]  And I expect it will triple again this year.
[09:16.610 --> 09:20.130]  So again, according to the 2014 Farm Bill,
[09:20.130 --> 09:23.370]  states had to pass individual pilot programs.
[09:23.370 --> 09:26.890]  By now, 41 states have enacted hemp bills.
[09:26.890 --> 09:32.210]  You can see those white states that are the ones left out.
[09:32.210 --> 09:36.130]  I was just giving a seminar at Ohio State.
[09:36.130 --> 09:38.650]  No hemp in Ohio.
[09:38.650 --> 09:40.930]  We have some guests here from Iowa.
[09:40.930 --> 09:43.450]  There's no hemp in Iowa.
[09:43.450 --> 09:47.810]  So Corteva, what have you been doing out there?
[09:47.810 --> 09:50.450]  South Dakota actually had legislation
[09:50.450 --> 09:52.410]  that they just voted down, and the governor
[09:52.410 --> 09:56.090]  is pretty firmly against hemp in South Dakota.
[09:56.090 --> 09:57.210]  Georgia's working on it.
[09:57.210 --> 09:59.250]  Texas is working on it.
[09:59.250 --> 10:04.210]  But the big states are Kentucky, Oregon, Colorado, North
[10:04.210 --> 10:08.370]  Carolina, and New York were the top five.
[10:08.370 --> 10:11.450]  So again, starting in 2016, pretty much
[10:11.450 --> 10:15.010]  the first opportunity for states to grow after the 2014 Farm
[10:15.010 --> 10:17.050]  Bill, about 10,000 acres.
[10:17.050 --> 10:19.370]  And by now this year, I predict we'll
[10:19.370 --> 10:25.250]  be up to 250,000 to 300,000 acres nationwide.
[10:25.250 --> 10:27.490]  The other aspect of gold rush for the students
[10:27.490 --> 10:30.890]  in the audience is in jobs.
[10:30.890 --> 10:34.130]  So I've seen an estimate of, in the next two years,
[10:34.130 --> 10:37.970]  500,000 jobs in the cannabis industry.
[10:37.970 --> 10:41.650]  And we will be launching certificate programs and MPS
[10:41.650 --> 10:42.530]  programs.
[10:42.530 --> 10:46.250]  Karlyn Buckler is teaching a course in cannabis biology
[10:46.250 --> 10:47.450]  this fall.
[10:47.450 --> 10:50.130]  So students will start signing up for that on Monday.
[10:51.130 --> 10:58.730]  So in response to this opportunity
[10:58.730 --> 11:02.210]  to start cultivating hemp in New York,
[11:02.210 --> 11:04.530]  Chris Smart, the director of the School of Integrated Plant
[11:04.530 --> 11:07.650]  Science, assembled a multidisciplinary team.
[11:07.650 --> 11:09.490]  We've been working very well together,
[11:09.490 --> 11:12.170]  together with 10 Cornell Cooperative Extension
[11:12.170 --> 11:15.250]  specialists across the state and with New York State Ag
[11:15.250 --> 11:15.850]  and Markets.
[11:15.850 --> 11:19.730]  We have conference calls every two weeks
[11:19.730 --> 11:22.210]  covering pretty much all aspects of the crop,
[11:22.210 --> 11:24.770]  from plant breeding to pathology, entomology, seed
[11:24.770 --> 11:31.250]  science, biochemistry, tissue culture, microbiome research.
[11:31.250 --> 11:32.450]  We're trying to do it all.
[11:32.450 --> 11:36.090]  And I think we probably now have the largest and most
[11:36.090 --> 11:40.130]  comprehensive academic research team in the country.
[11:40.130 --> 11:43.970]  Part of that is because of very enthusiastic and generous
[11:43.970 --> 11:47.090]  support from the governor and the legislature.
[11:47.090 --> 11:50.450]  So in early 2017, the governor committed $5 million
[11:50.450 --> 11:54.130]  for academic research in hemp.
[11:54.130 --> 11:57.050]  Some of that went to Morrisville State College.
[11:57.050 --> 12:01.890]  But we at Cornell have benefited from almost $4 million
[12:01.890 --> 12:06.490]  of that $5 million so far, including $2 million
[12:06.490 --> 12:07.570]  for our breeding program.
[12:10.330 --> 12:14.010]  So cannabis is a very diverse crop.
[12:14.010 --> 12:16.450]  You saw the diversity of market classes,
[12:16.450 --> 12:18.090]  market opportunities.
[12:18.090 --> 12:21.530]  But it's also grown in very different ways in the field.
[12:21.530 --> 12:23.770]  Either it can be grown in the greenhouse
[12:23.770 --> 12:26.010]  or in controlled environment settings.
[12:26.010 --> 12:30.450]  For CBD, it's grown similar to tobacco or tomatoes.
[12:30.450 --> 12:33.850]  So in Kentucky and North Carolina,
[12:33.850 --> 12:36.370]  it has been relatively easy for the tobacco growers
[12:36.370 --> 12:39.770]  to transition to hemp, grown under raised beds
[12:39.770 --> 12:43.770]  with trickle irrigation, planted from transplants,
[12:43.770 --> 12:48.410]  hand harvested, dried in tobacco barns, and hand stripped.
[12:48.410 --> 12:50.010]  So a lot of that is hand labor.
[12:50.010 --> 12:52.930]  We'll talk about that a little bit later.
[12:52.930 --> 12:57.130]  We have some growers that are growing hemp for baby greens
[12:57.130 --> 13:00.290]  and marketing it at Whole Foods in New York City for $12
[13:00.290 --> 13:03.330]  or $13 a clam shell.
[13:03.330 --> 13:06.090]  But traditionally, hemp has been grown for grain
[13:06.090 --> 13:10.210]  as a field crop, planted with a cereal grain drill,
[13:10.210 --> 13:13.050]  harvested with a combine, and for fiber, again,
[13:13.050 --> 13:15.970]  planted in high density as a field crop,
[13:15.970 --> 13:17.930]  harvested with a sickle bar mower,
[13:17.930 --> 13:20.770]  and baled with a large round baler.
[13:20.770 --> 13:24.250]  So quite a diversity of cultivation methods.
[13:24.250 --> 13:26.530]  It's also a very interesting crop
[13:26.530 --> 13:30.130]  in terms of its reproductive biology.
[13:30.130 --> 13:32.450]  And I've done a lot of work on willow,
[13:32.450 --> 13:34.010]  which is another dioecious crop.
[13:34.010 --> 13:36.290]  We've been doing a lot of work recently studying
[13:36.290 --> 13:39.170]  the sex determination region and sex chromosomes
[13:39.170 --> 13:41.010]  in the Salicaceae.
[13:41.010 --> 13:43.410]  So it's a logical transition for us
[13:43.410 --> 13:46.970]  to start working on sex dimorphism
[13:46.970 --> 13:52.970]  and sexually dimorphic patterns of gene expression in hemp.
[13:52.970 --> 13:56.730]  The cultivars are either dioecious,
[13:56.730 --> 14:00.530]  meaning pretty much a 50-50 mix, of male plants,
[14:00.530 --> 14:04.530]  which you can see here, senesce before the females,
[14:04.530 --> 14:07.610]  producing the pollen, and the females setting the grain
[14:07.610 --> 14:09.610]  heads here.
[14:09.610 --> 14:13.090]  There are some variants that are monoecious,
[14:13.090 --> 14:15.370]  that produce both male and female flowers
[14:15.370 --> 14:16.290]  on the grain heads.
[14:16.290 --> 14:19.210]  Those are some of our best producing grain varieties
[14:19.210 --> 14:23.810]  right now, or dual-purpose grain and fiber cultivars.
[14:23.810 --> 14:28.290]  But for CBD and THC, you want to grow unpollinated female
[14:28.290 --> 14:30.090]  plants.
[14:30.090 --> 14:32.810]  Those chemicals are made on trichomes
[14:32.810 --> 14:37.770]  on the bracts of the female floral tissue.
[14:37.770 --> 14:40.770]  And when the females are pollinated,
[14:40.770 --> 14:46.650]  the levels of CBD or THC go down two to threefold.
[14:46.650 --> 14:52.290]  So there are tricks to manipulating floral development
[14:52.290 --> 14:55.050]  in cannabis.
[14:55.050 --> 14:57.930]  Gibberellic acid promotes masculinity.
[14:57.930 --> 15:02.850]  Ethylene promotes femininity, female flowers.
[15:02.850 --> 15:06.250]  So you can use ethylene inhibitors
[15:06.250 --> 15:12.010]  to induce male flowers on female plants.
[15:12.010 --> 15:16.170]  The pollen produced from those male flower parts
[15:16.170 --> 15:18.890]  only have X chromosomes.
[15:18.890 --> 15:22.850]  So when you use that X pollen to pollinate the female plants,
[15:22.850 --> 15:25.410]  all of the seed is XX.
[15:25.410 --> 15:28.410]  So we call that feminized seed.
[15:28.410 --> 15:30.970]  And it's a way to plant out a field
[15:30.970 --> 15:35.570]  and only get female plants, which is what you want.
[15:35.570 --> 15:39.130]  Right now, that feminized seed for CBD lines
[15:39.130 --> 15:42.130]  is selling for $1 a seed.
[15:42.130 --> 15:44.330]  $1 a seed.
[15:44.330 --> 15:47.170]  So those folks who are very good at doing this treatment,
[15:47.170 --> 15:50.090]  inducing male flowers on female plants
[15:50.090 --> 15:53.730]  and generating tons of feminized seed,
[15:53.730 --> 15:58.970]  are making hundreds of millions of dollars right now.
[15:58.970 --> 16:02.010]  We have some ideas about manipulating sex and maybe
[16:02.050 --> 16:05.770]  generating some sterile plants.
[16:05.770 --> 16:10.530]  Again, we learn more about hemp every day.
[16:10.530 --> 16:13.010]  One thing that Jacob has done, he
[16:13.010 --> 16:16.090]  has really contributed a lot over the last few months.
[16:16.090 --> 16:19.210]  There are some Y chromosome-specific markers.
[16:19.210 --> 16:22.610]  And Jacob has converted those into Cas markers.
[16:22.610 --> 16:26.810]  So now we have good genetic tests for male and female,
[16:26.810 --> 16:28.770]  for XX or XY.
[16:28.770 --> 16:32.610]  Those genetic tests are commercially available as well.
[16:32.610 --> 16:35.450]  So commercial growers can test their plants.
[16:35.450 --> 16:37.610]  The only issue there is these companies
[16:37.610 --> 16:40.290]  are charging $10 per sample.
[16:40.290 --> 16:42.610]  So if you want to do a whole field,
[16:42.610 --> 16:44.970]  it's not practical at this point.
[16:44.970 --> 16:46.850]  We can do it for our trials because we're only
[16:46.850 --> 16:49.090]  putting a couple hundred plants out in the field.
[16:49.090 --> 16:54.490]  So doing 2,000 tests, I think we're only $1.50, maybe $2
[16:54.490 --> 16:59.940]  a sample to get these assays done.
[17:00.940 --> 17:03.380]  So this is sort of an outline of the way
[17:03.380 --> 17:06.100]  I'm going to organize the rest of my talk.
[17:06.100 --> 17:08.740]  As we think about establishing a breeding
[17:08.740 --> 17:12.460]  program for a new crop, these are sort of the steps
[17:12.460 --> 17:14.900]  that I envision that we need to take.
[17:14.900 --> 17:17.780]  We need to assemble some germplasm.
[17:17.780 --> 17:19.660]  We need to characterize that germplasm
[17:19.660 --> 17:21.860]  and develop phenotyping techniques
[17:21.860 --> 17:24.660]  and look at the traits that we want to start to select for.
[17:24.660 --> 17:26.900]  So I'll talk about the trials that we've
[17:26.900 --> 17:29.820]  done over the last two years for grain, fiber,
[17:29.820 --> 17:34.660]  and dual-purpose grain and fiber crops.
[17:34.660 --> 17:40.980]  And we've also done one year of trials to look at CBD slash THC.
[17:40.980 --> 17:43.940]  Those are the main traits there.
[17:43.940 --> 17:46.140]  We've done some work together with Cornell Cooperative
[17:46.140 --> 17:48.180]  Extension to model the cost of production.
[17:48.180 --> 17:50.500]  That's important in any breeding program
[17:50.500 --> 17:52.820]  because you want to breed for traits that will improve
[17:52.820 --> 17:56.580]  the profitability of the crop and help us
[17:56.580 --> 18:00.900]  to establish an idiotype for what we're breeding.
[18:00.900 --> 18:02.900]  What are our breeding goals?
[18:02.900 --> 18:05.620]  And then based on the biology, the traits
[18:05.620 --> 18:07.660]  that we want to select for, the variation
[18:07.660 --> 18:10.900]  that we see in the germplasm that we have,
[18:10.900 --> 18:14.380]  and the crossing techniques, cannabis
[18:14.380 --> 18:18.820]  is a wind-pollinated crop, highly outbreeding,
[18:18.820 --> 18:21.140]  highly heterozygous.
[18:21.140 --> 18:24.580]  We need to develop a breeding strategy and marker systems
[18:24.580 --> 18:27.940]  that we can incorporate to do marker-assisted selection.
[18:27.940 --> 18:33.060]  I just showed you one for male, female sex.
[18:33.060 --> 18:35.380]  But we'd eventually like to be able to develop markers
[18:35.380 --> 18:38.940]  for genomic selection.
[18:38.940 --> 18:40.940]  OK.
[18:40.940 --> 18:44.580]  So the first step, assembling germplasm.
[18:44.580 --> 18:46.300]  For the rest of the breeders in the room,
[18:46.300 --> 18:48.220]  when they think about assembling germplasm,
[18:48.220 --> 18:52.460]  when Mark thinks about adding diversity to his wheat breeding
[18:52.460 --> 18:56.500]  program, he might go to the GRIN database and say,
[18:56.500 --> 18:58.740]  oh, let me find some lines from Turkey
[18:58.740 --> 19:03.260]  or some lines from other places to incorporate.
[19:03.260 --> 19:08.420]  So the USDA used to have a hemp germplasm collection.
[19:08.420 --> 19:14.140]  When you go to GRIN, you see that there are 150 accessions
[19:14.140 --> 19:18.940]  in the database, zero available.
[19:18.940 --> 19:21.340]  That's because that collection was destroyed
[19:21.340 --> 19:24.380]  after the passing of the Controlled Substance Act.
[19:24.380 --> 19:29.620]  So we do not have a US hemp germplasm collection.
[19:29.620 --> 19:32.660]  The Vaviloff Institute has a hemp germplasm collection
[19:32.660 --> 19:36.900]  that's been rather difficult for people to access.
[19:36.900 --> 19:39.380]  I was reading a paper yesterday about a Canadian,
[19:39.380 --> 19:42.180]  one of the pioneering Canadian researchers in the 70s
[19:42.180 --> 19:44.540]  who did a diversity study.
[19:44.540 --> 19:49.020]  He accumulated 150 accessions, including 75 or 80
[19:49.060 --> 19:51.900]  from the Vaviloff Institute.
[19:51.900 --> 19:55.100]  When the Canadian government found out that he had all this,
[19:55.100 --> 19:59.500]  they destroyed his whole collection.
[19:59.500 --> 20:02.380]  My colleague George Weeblen at University of Minnesota
[20:02.380 --> 20:05.860]  collected a lot of feral populations.
[20:05.860 --> 20:08.260]  So that's another thing that we can look at
[20:08.260 --> 20:12.460]  is there is a lot of ditchweed out there.
[20:12.460 --> 20:15.820]  I showed you the states that grew all the hemp in World War
[20:15.820 --> 20:23.380]  II, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Nebraska.
[20:23.380 --> 20:27.980]  And those states still have a lot of feral hemp
[20:27.980 --> 20:29.700]  on the landscape.
[20:29.700 --> 20:32.660]  George Weeblen characterized some of that feral hemp
[20:32.660 --> 20:36.020]  under DEA scrutiny.
[20:36.020 --> 20:37.980]  And then when he was done with the study,
[20:37.980 --> 20:39.940]  they destroyed it all.
[20:39.940 --> 20:43.340]  So that has been the history of trying
[20:43.340 --> 20:48.820]  to accumulate hemp germplasm over the last couple of decades.
[20:48.820 --> 20:52.100]  But now with the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp
[20:52.100 --> 20:54.900]  has been taken off of the Schedule I controlled substance
[20:54.900 --> 20:56.580]  list.
[20:56.580 --> 20:58.940]  So now we should be able to work freely
[20:58.940 --> 21:02.420]  without the scrutiny of the DEA, although we still
[21:02.420 --> 21:08.260]  need to prove to people that it's hemp and not marijuana.
[21:08.260 --> 21:12.500]  So this is an interesting map because you see a lot of hemp
[21:12.540 --> 21:15.700]  where I don't really think hemp is growing.
[21:15.700 --> 21:19.020]  This includes cannabis sativa.
[21:19.020 --> 21:24.100]  And it's actually on five state noxious weed lists.
[21:24.100 --> 21:27.020]  And I'm not sure they fully interpreted weed there
[21:27.020 --> 21:32.140]  properly because if you look at West Virginia,
[21:32.140 --> 21:34.540]  it's only in a few counties in West Virginia.
[21:34.540 --> 21:38.060]  It's not like an invasive weed, but it's a weed.
[21:38.060 --> 21:41.980]  And they put it on the noxious weed list in West Virginia.
[21:41.980 --> 21:44.340]  In Minnesota, I'm more confident
[21:44.340 --> 21:48.160]  that ditch weed really has spread outside
[21:48.160 --> 21:52.180]  of its range of cultivation.
[21:52.180 --> 21:54.740]  So we do have intentions now that we
[21:54.740 --> 21:59.740]  can collect hemp freely without the scrutiny of the DEA,
[21:59.740 --> 22:03.660]  doing some excursions to the Midwest,
[22:03.660 --> 22:05.820]  and finding some feral hemp populations.
[22:05.820 --> 22:09.400]  We have found three feral hemp populations in New York
[22:09.400 --> 22:14.880]  already, but it was pretty well eradicated.
[22:14.880 --> 22:17.000]  So the other possibility is to look
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  to the native range of hemp, which is in Central Asia.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.780]  And I was very lucky to visit Kazakhstan last year
[22:25.780 --> 22:30.720]  where they have 200,000 acres of wild hemp growing.
[22:30.720 --> 22:33.860]  And maybe we can cultivate those relationships.
[22:33.860 --> 22:36.400]  That was related to our historic relationship
[22:36.400 --> 22:41.840]  in Geneva in the assembly of the apple germplasm collection
[22:41.840 --> 22:44.000]  and numerous collection trips that my colleagues
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.880]  made to build our apple germplasm
[22:46.880 --> 22:48.840]  collection in Geneva.
[22:48.840 --> 22:53.400]  So I'm hopeful that we can do the same thing with cannabis,
[22:53.400 --> 22:56.760]  but it is highly illegal in Kazakhstan.
[22:56.760 --> 23:03.520]  So we will need to have some influence on the government
[23:03.520 --> 23:06.800]  in Kazakhstan, maybe find an oligarch who
[23:06.800 --> 23:11.360]  can help us make some collections there in Kazakhstan.
[23:11.360 --> 23:14.800]  Also Pakistan, Uzbekistan, India,
[23:14.800 --> 23:18.320]  you can see how hemp moved from that native range
[23:18.320 --> 23:22.200]  around the world as it was cultivated
[23:22.200 --> 23:26.520]  over the last 1,000 years.
[23:26.520 --> 23:29.920]  So the other question is the diversity of that germplasm.
[23:29.920 --> 23:32.600]  And the current marijuana germplasm
[23:32.600 --> 23:35.240]  really has very low diversity.
[23:35.240 --> 23:37.720]  So this is one of the better examples.
[23:37.720 --> 23:42.320]  This is a 3D PCA on the web that you can play around with.
[23:42.320 --> 23:45.560]  You can click on each point and see which sample it is.
[23:45.560 --> 23:48.880]  This is a company called Phylos in Portland, Oregon.
[23:48.880 --> 23:50.600]  And for full disclosure, I'm serving
[23:50.600 --> 23:52.920]  on their scientific advisory board right now.
[23:52.920 --> 23:57.880]  But they had a business of collecting samples,
[23:57.880 --> 24:01.760]  doing amplicon sequencing, and then creating this diversity
[24:01.800 --> 24:05.480]  map on the website so that everyone
[24:05.480 --> 24:08.360]  who has their own genetics.
[24:08.360 --> 24:11.560]  This is a term we learned early on in the hemp business,
[24:11.560 --> 24:12.960]  is that if you're in the business,
[24:12.960 --> 24:17.440]  you have your own genetics, which means,
[24:17.440 --> 24:20.160]  where did you get your own genetics?
[24:20.160 --> 24:22.280]  And how is it yours now?
[24:22.280 --> 24:25.000]  Because I'm a breeder.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.520]  And in order to protect that and demonstrate
[24:27.520 --> 24:30.560]  that your own genetics is different from anyone else's,
[24:30.560 --> 24:32.720]  you would send a sample to Phylos,
[24:32.720 --> 24:36.000]  and they would put it up on the Phylos Galaxy here.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.080]  And you could prove that your stuff is
[24:38.080 --> 24:40.440]  different from everyone else's.
[24:40.440 --> 24:44.760]  So just looking at the color codes here,
[24:44.760 --> 24:49.280]  hemp are the yellowish dots here.
[24:49.280 --> 24:52.360]  The green is what people are calling land races.
[24:52.360 --> 24:53.880]  And again, these are just samples
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.880]  that are submitted by people willing to pay $300 per sample
[24:58.880 --> 25:02.040]  to get it onto the Phylos Galaxy.
[25:02.040 --> 25:05.440]  The CBD lines are all over here on the left in light blue.
[25:05.440 --> 25:10.960]  And you see there is a lot of relatedness here in CBD land.
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.760]  And the light purple and red here are marijuana lines.
[25:17.760 --> 25:18.880]  So that's very interesting.
[25:18.880 --> 25:19.840]  Go play around with it.
[25:19.840 --> 25:22.200]  It's a very cool interface.
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.760]  It's something that we hope to sort of reproduce ourselves.
[25:27.800 --> 25:31.240]  We've got some GBS samples being sequenced right now.
[25:31.240 --> 25:36.960]  But we hope to go to a sequence capture genotyping system,
[25:36.960 --> 25:40.720]  which has worked very well in Poplar and Willow.
[25:40.720 --> 25:46.600]  So we have accumulated germplasm as we have been able to.
[25:46.600 --> 25:49.320]  All of the commercial cultivars are protected
[25:49.320 --> 25:50.520]  by those breeding companies.
[25:50.520 --> 25:53.240]  They won't allow us to breed with them, pretty much.
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.200]  We have one or two relationships with breeding companies.
[25:58.200 --> 26:01.560]  But the rest of the breeding companies are very protective.
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.160]  In fact, some of the CBD, most popular CBD companies,
[26:05.160 --> 26:08.640]  will not send me material just to put in trials
[26:08.640 --> 26:11.720]  because they're afraid that I will start breeding with it.
[26:11.720 --> 26:15.440]  So people are very protective of their germplasm.
[26:15.440 --> 26:19.400]  And you really have no idea what its pedigree is,
[26:19.400 --> 26:25.400]  where it came from, whether it's hemp or not hemp.
[26:25.400 --> 26:29.600]  So we hope to reproduce this ourselves.
[26:29.600 --> 26:32.040]  Okay, moving on to phenotyping and trialing.
[26:32.040 --> 26:37.800]  This is not only for us to demonstrate the utility
[26:37.800 --> 26:39.880]  of different cultivars for our growers in New York,
[26:39.880 --> 26:44.520]  but also for us to look at the traits of the germplasm
[26:44.520 --> 26:46.640]  that we have available.
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.760]  So we've been doing this in small plot trials,
[26:50.760 --> 26:53.200]  sharing a lot of equipment with the Sorrel's group.
[26:53.200 --> 26:54.480]  So we appreciate that.
[26:54.480 --> 26:57.120]  We're very grateful for that.
[26:57.120 --> 27:00.040]  Planting grain and dual-purpose trials
[27:00.040 --> 27:02.160]  at 15 live seeds per square foot,
[27:02.160 --> 27:04.840]  which is about 25 pounds to the acre.
[27:04.840 --> 27:06.960]  The fiber is planted at a higher density,
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.120]  30 live seeds per square foot,
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.160]  or about 50 pounds to the acre.
[27:11.160 --> 27:16.600]  And evaluating all of these traits as best we can.
[27:17.080 --> 27:20.440]  So hemp is a very finicky crop to establish in the field.
[27:20.440 --> 27:23.800]  It has very specific depth requirements,
[27:23.800 --> 27:25.280]  moisture requirements.
[27:25.280 --> 27:28.040]  It does not like flooding at all.
[27:28.040 --> 27:29.760]  So that's one thing we've learned already
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.000]  in just two years.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.480]  In 2017, we had very good establishment and a good crop.
[27:35.480 --> 27:37.880]  After it germinates, it will get about four
[27:37.880 --> 27:38.920]  to five inches tall,
[27:38.920 --> 27:42.120]  and then sort of sit there for three weeks.
[27:42.120 --> 27:45.320]  So I'll show you last year, that was a problem
[27:45.320 --> 27:48.440]  because we had about five or six weeks with no rain.
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.080]  But in 2017, we had nearly perfect growing conditions.
[27:52.080 --> 27:54.440]  And you see after seven weeks,
[27:54.440 --> 27:56.520]  that stuff is five or six feet tall.
[27:58.560 --> 28:01.600]  We're using a small plot combine to harvest this.
[28:01.600 --> 28:04.840]  And now we have another El Meco combine in Geneva,
[28:04.840 --> 28:07.200]  in addition to the one we have here in Ithaca,
[28:08.080 --> 28:09.640]  to measure grain yields.
[28:11.600 --> 28:15.240]  And in 2017, we tested 13 commercially available
[28:16.040 --> 28:17.520]  certified grain cultivars,
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.600]  and got on average about 1400 pounds to the acre.
[28:21.600 --> 28:24.640]  The best cultivar and the best plot,
[28:24.640 --> 28:29.320]  best trial was nearly 2400 pounds to the acre,
[28:29.320 --> 28:32.200]  where the average Canadian yields is 800
[28:32.200 --> 28:34.560]  to 900 pounds to the acre.
[28:34.560 --> 28:37.480]  So I think we have very good potential
[28:37.480 --> 28:39.920]  to get high yields of grain production
[28:39.920 --> 28:41.080]  here in New York State.
[28:42.080 --> 28:45.880]  And it could be a good rotation field crop
[28:45.880 --> 28:49.160]  with our other field crops,
[28:49.160 --> 28:51.560]  and offer more opportunities for farmers.
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.480]  That grain is high in oil.
[28:56.480 --> 29:01.160]  So 35 to 36% oil with a very healthy mix
[29:01.160 --> 29:04.240]  of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.
[29:04.240 --> 29:06.920]  Again, that oil is a good culinary oil,
[29:06.920 --> 29:09.760]  not a cooking oil, but for salad dressings,
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.120]  pestos, other low temperature applications,
[29:14.120 --> 29:16.680]  because it has a very low smoking temperature.
[29:16.680 --> 29:18.840]  It's a good replacement for fish oil
[29:18.840 --> 29:22.720]  because of that omega-6 and omega-3 balance there.
[29:22.720 --> 29:27.400]  And again, that oil is also a very good oil
[29:27.400 --> 29:30.160]  for cosmetic or personal care products.
[29:30.160 --> 29:32.760]  It's also actually a good wood preservative
[29:32.760 --> 29:33.720]  and a good paint.
[29:36.160 --> 29:38.000]  Once you press for that oil,
[29:38.880 --> 29:42.480]  there's a high percentage of protein in the press cake.
[29:42.480 --> 29:47.320]  So this is from the bulk seed, about 26 to 27% protein.
[29:48.400 --> 29:52.560]  So in the press cake, you can get around 50% protein.
[29:52.560 --> 29:54.960]  So that's another good market opportunity
[29:54.960 --> 29:58.600]  is gluten-free, soy-free, sorry about that,
[29:58.600 --> 30:01.600]  gluten-free, soy-free, GMO-free,
[30:02.680 --> 30:05.680]  often grown organic because there are no pesticides
[30:05.680 --> 30:07.240]  registered for hemp right now.
[30:08.120 --> 30:12.160]  So if you use organic fertilizer on certified organic land,
[30:12.160 --> 30:13.520]  it's really not that much different
[30:13.520 --> 30:15.760]  from conventional cultivation.
[30:17.840 --> 30:22.640]  And can be a good source of protein for plant-based meats,
[30:22.640 --> 30:27.280]  for high protein smoothie drinks, and for athletes.
[30:27.280 --> 30:31.720]  It's another market that we're trying to tap into,
[30:31.720 --> 30:33.680]  as well as for animal feeds.
[30:33.680 --> 30:37.800]  So there are groups now trying to get hemp research done
[30:38.600 --> 30:41.200]  to have it approved as an animal feed additive.
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.840]  There are studies already, research studies
[30:43.840 --> 30:46.400]  that show it's a very good poultry feed.
[30:46.400 --> 30:49.520]  And beef growers in Colorado are really pushing it
[30:49.520 --> 30:53.080]  because some of them are already using hemp
[30:53.080 --> 30:54.840]  and getting very high quality beef.
[30:56.920 --> 30:59.360]  So in 2018, those trials were done
[30:59.360 --> 31:01.080]  only in Ithaca and Geneva.
[31:01.080 --> 31:04.760]  In 2017 and 2018, we expanded to include Long Island
[31:04.760 --> 31:06.480]  and Chay Zee.
[31:06.480 --> 31:09.960]  So covering the full latitudinal range in New York State.
[31:11.200 --> 31:14.600]  Planted still a little bit late from June 8th to June 20th,
[31:14.600 --> 31:18.200]  but one of the main issues that we've had
[31:18.200 --> 31:20.960]  is in acquiring seed, getting it imported
[31:20.960 --> 31:23.920]  under DEA restrictions.
[31:23.920 --> 31:25.480]  So we've always been a little bit late.
[31:25.480 --> 31:29.120]  This year, we're gonna be spot on time, I'm sure of it.
[31:30.120 --> 31:35.120]  So six sites, and we also did some larger strip trials
[31:35.720 --> 31:37.040]  for combine demos.
[31:38.040 --> 31:40.560]  So I put up the list of cultivars here.
[31:40.560 --> 31:43.120]  One thing we learned in 2017 is that we needed
[31:43.120 --> 31:46.880]  to break up our trials into blocks based on maturity date.
[31:47.800 --> 31:51.640]  So we put the early maturing grain varieties in one block,
[31:51.640 --> 31:56.640]  the later maturing dual purpose varieties in another block,
[31:57.160 --> 31:59.600]  and then the fiber varieties, which we're gonna cut
[31:59.600 --> 32:01.760]  with a sickle bar mower in a third block.
[32:02.600 --> 32:05.120]  So that's how I've got them organized here.
[32:05.120 --> 32:09.840]  One thing you see is that there are big issues
[32:09.840 --> 32:11.100]  with seed quality.
[32:12.640 --> 32:15.440]  That the seed laws are really not being enforced
[32:15.440 --> 32:18.620]  in hemp right now in the US.
[32:19.600 --> 32:24.600]  And when we get seed lots from a breeder in Oregon,
[32:26.920 --> 32:29.860]  he sent us seed with 39% germination.
[32:31.080 --> 32:33.400]  Most of the commercial seed lots that we've gotten
[32:33.400 --> 32:36.760]  have been pretty good, over 85%.
[32:36.760 --> 32:40.160]  But some of them coming in from Europe, not so good.
[32:41.520 --> 32:44.320]  There are also differences in thousand kernel weight.
[32:45.400 --> 32:50.400]  So you can see one here at 22 and one here under 12.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.640]  So that's a trait that we're interested in looking at
[32:54.640 --> 32:59.320]  is seed size, how it relates to early seedling vigor,
[32:59.320 --> 33:01.300]  and again, yield of oil and protein.
[33:03.840 --> 33:07.640]  So 2018 was not a perfect growing season.
[33:07.640 --> 33:11.480]  Again, five to six weeks with no rain after planting.
[33:11.480 --> 33:13.640]  That allowed the weeds to take off
[33:13.640 --> 33:16.120]  as the hemp was sitting there that tall.
[33:16.120 --> 33:20.320]  And in fact, some of our early maturing grain cultivar plots
[33:20.320 --> 33:22.820]  we lost to weeds, we lost it to the pigweed.
[33:24.880 --> 33:28.520]  And then we got very heavy rain later in the season.
[33:28.520 --> 33:31.640]  And hemp does not like flooding conditions.
[33:31.640 --> 33:34.320]  So our yields were much lower in 2018.
[33:35.320 --> 33:39.200]  Highest grain yield there averaging 800 pounds to the acre.
[33:41.020 --> 33:44.480]  Keep this Pewter River in mind here,
[33:45.400 --> 33:46.420]  because that's gonna play into
[33:46.420 --> 33:49.020]  our longer term breeding strategies.
[33:51.360 --> 33:52.860]  Looking at dual purpose cultivars,
[33:52.860 --> 33:56.180]  again, a lot of these have been bred in Italy, France,
[33:56.180 --> 33:59.160]  Poland, a couple from Canada here.
[34:01.740 --> 34:05.660]  This is the first US certified cultivar
[34:05.660 --> 34:09.660]  from John McKay's company, New West Genetics in Colorado.
[34:09.660 --> 34:11.140]  And again, some that we've gotten
[34:11.140 --> 34:14.020]  from some breeders in Oregon.
[34:14.020 --> 34:15.900]  Just wanted to show you sort of the diversity
[34:15.900 --> 34:19.280]  of where our germplasm is coming from.
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.520]  Again, 2018 yields not nearly as good as we would hope
[34:23.520 --> 34:25.680]  based on our 2017 results.
[34:26.880 --> 34:30.360]  Definitely differences in site quality.
[34:30.360 --> 34:33.840]  Hemp is a very nitrogen demanding crop, we've learned that.
[34:33.840 --> 34:37.600]  And again, very intolerant of poorly drained soils.
[34:39.780 --> 34:42.240]  But we still have a lot more to learn about that.
[34:45.120 --> 34:47.320]  Maybe a little bit of good news from 2018.
[34:47.320 --> 34:50.360]  We planted these larger two to three acre fields
[34:50.360 --> 34:52.920]  for combine demos a couple of weeks later
[34:52.920 --> 34:54.600]  than our cultivar trials.
[34:55.620 --> 34:57.920]  So they got the rain a little bit earlier.
[34:57.920 --> 35:00.840]  And here in this field of Anka,
[35:00.840 --> 35:04.200]  which is a Canadian cultivar that is proving
[35:04.200 --> 35:06.240]  to be one of our better cultivars,
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.800]  we got 1300 pounds to the acre, dirty seed,
[35:09.800 --> 35:11.880]  probably about 1200 pounds clean.
[35:12.880 --> 35:15.880]  So again, that's a reasonable yield,
[35:15.880 --> 35:18.520]  economically viable yield of seed.
[35:18.520 --> 35:21.320]  I think we can get it up over 1400
[35:21.320 --> 35:24.140]  to maybe 2000 pounds to the acre commercially.
[35:27.380 --> 35:30.700]  Okay, looking at fiber, the best fiber cultivars
[35:30.700 --> 35:33.060]  have been bred in Italy so far.
[35:33.060 --> 35:36.500]  Although we just imported nine cultivars from China.
[35:36.500 --> 35:38.780]  So we'll be comparing Chinese
[35:38.780 --> 35:41.560]  to Italian fiber cultivars this year.
[35:44.100 --> 35:46.780]  And in 2017, again, a pretty good growing season
[35:46.780 --> 35:50.460]  by harvest time, they were eight to nine feet tall,
[35:52.740 --> 35:55.340]  forming a nice dense canopy there,
[35:55.340 --> 35:58.040]  which we harvest with a sickle bar mower.
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.420]  In 2017, we just weighed the fresh weight
[36:01.420 --> 36:04.540]  with all the leaves, dried a subsample,
[36:05.580 --> 36:08.420]  but we realized that's not ideal.
[36:08.420 --> 36:11.060]  We got some criticism for not retting it.
[36:11.060 --> 36:14.020]  So this would be the normal process for fiber hemp
[36:14.020 --> 36:16.980]  is to cut it and leave it on the field to ret,
[36:18.460 --> 36:22.340]  allowing nutrients to leach out of the tissue
[36:22.340 --> 36:26.100]  back to the soil, but also encouraging microbial growth
[36:26.100 --> 36:29.860]  to separate the high quality bast fiber
[36:29.860 --> 36:31.540]  on the outside of the stem
[36:31.540 --> 36:34.180]  from the woody herd tissue in the middle.
[36:34.180 --> 36:37.580]  So that it can then go to be decorticated
[36:37.580 --> 36:40.420]  and separated into those two product lines,
[36:40.420 --> 36:44.460]  the long fiber and the woody herd tissue.
[36:45.300 --> 36:48.260]  So we attempted this in our trials,
[36:48.260 --> 36:52.660]  doing some retting to get them dry straw weight.
[36:53.620 --> 36:57.540]  And again, we were getting reasonably competitive,
[36:57.540 --> 37:00.220]  commercially viable yields of retted straw
[37:00.220 --> 37:03.420]  between three to four tons to the acre.
[37:03.420 --> 37:07.160]  And if the bast fiber is about 20 to 25%,
[37:07.160 --> 37:09.080]  you're getting about a thousand pounds
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.320]  of high quality bast fiber that you could use
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.240]  for rope or fabric or biocomposite materials.
[37:18.920 --> 37:22.900]  So we will continue to do that type of cultivar evaluation,
[37:22.900 --> 37:25.620]  trying to encourage a grain and fiber industry
[37:25.620 --> 37:27.540]  to develop in New York state.
[37:27.540 --> 37:30.180]  We really need a fiber processor to come in
[37:30.180 --> 37:33.040]  and install the decorticating equipment
[37:33.040 --> 37:35.080]  so that we can start to incorporate hemp
[37:35.080 --> 37:40.080]  into some of these novel biocomposite materials.
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.120]  So BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche are using
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.280]  hemp compressed panels in some of their automobiles
[37:49.280 --> 37:52.840]  because it is lighter and just as strong
[37:52.840 --> 37:54.840]  as other materials that they can use.
[37:56.920 --> 37:58.600]  Okay, moving on to look at CBD.
[37:58.600 --> 38:01.320]  That's what everyone's interested in.
[38:01.320 --> 38:03.840]  On the left there, you see a commercial CBD field
[38:03.840 --> 38:05.600]  growing in Orange County.
[38:05.600 --> 38:08.680]  That was planted from a clone.
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.380]  So it looks very uniform there in the field.
[38:12.380 --> 38:15.080]  We planted from seeds last year
[38:15.080 --> 38:16.560]  that we started in the greenhouse
[38:16.560 --> 38:19.560]  and we didn't have those sex markers developed yet.
[38:19.560 --> 38:23.100]  So we were hoping to see the male plants.
[38:23.100 --> 38:25.280]  We didn't have any feminized seed either.
[38:26.160 --> 38:28.840]  So we needed to wait for them to flower
[38:28.840 --> 38:31.320]  to remove the male plants.
[38:31.320 --> 38:34.560]  Some of our lines did that in the greenhouse,
[38:34.560 --> 38:36.760]  but even though we let them get way too tall
[38:36.760 --> 38:40.000]  before we planted them, many of them did not flower
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.580]  and we were out there every day or every other day
[38:42.580 --> 38:44.140]  calling out the male plants.
[38:45.120 --> 38:46.640]  So that was a lot of work.
[38:48.800 --> 38:52.120]  It's why growers are willing to pay a dollar per seed
[38:52.120 --> 38:53.920]  for feminized seed right now
[38:53.920 --> 38:57.280]  is because if you plant dietitian plants,
[38:57.280 --> 39:00.680]  you have a lot, a huge labor requirement
[39:01.040 --> 39:04.000]  going out there calling out male plants every day
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.160]  as they come to flower.
[39:06.800 --> 39:10.520]  I also did not have a good representative sample
[39:10.520 --> 39:12.440]  of commercially available cultivars.
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.120]  We really had lines from two breeders,
[39:16.120 --> 39:18.620]  one in Las Vegas and one in Oregon,
[39:19.560 --> 39:23.080]  as well as a couple of other lines that we picked up,
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.860]  but these were not stable.
[39:24.860 --> 39:27.320]  As you're gonna see, not stable,
[39:27.320 --> 39:29.900]  commercially ready CBD lines.
[39:31.520 --> 39:34.400]  This year, I've been scouring the internet,
[39:34.400 --> 39:36.360]  talking to seed companies,
[39:36.360 --> 39:39.640]  and we have a pretty good representative group
[39:39.640 --> 39:44.640]  of 30 cultivars, both feminized seed and female clones,
[39:44.800 --> 39:47.720]  and some dietitian lines that will sort out the males
[39:47.720 --> 39:50.880]  with molecular markers, ready to go for our trials this year.
[39:51.920 --> 39:54.120]  So we planted on two sites, one in Geneva,
[39:54.120 --> 39:56.320]  one in Ithaca at Bluegrass Lane,
[39:57.160 --> 40:00.280]  under plastic, raised beds with plastic
[40:00.280 --> 40:01.660]  and trickle irrigation.
[40:02.840 --> 40:05.580]  But as you know, and actually,
[40:05.580 --> 40:08.400]  I think this was right after our field day
[40:08.400 --> 40:09.680]  in the second week of August,
[40:09.680 --> 40:12.380]  where we got three and a half inches of rain that day.
[40:13.560 --> 40:15.020]  Not great for a field day.
[40:16.200 --> 40:18.000]  We had standing water in that field,
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.700]  and one thing we learned about hemp
[40:19.700 --> 40:22.260]  is it does not tolerate standing water.
[40:22.260 --> 40:25.560]  Within a week or so, many of those plants died.
[40:25.560 --> 40:26.920]  That was a similar situation
[40:26.920 --> 40:28.620]  for some of our commercial growers.
[40:28.620 --> 40:33.320]  They lost anywhere from 25 to 50% of their plants
[40:33.320 --> 40:36.000]  if they were on a poorly drained site.
[40:37.120 --> 40:38.960]  Some of them did okay with the raised beds,
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.200]  but hemp does not tolerate flooding.
[40:43.400 --> 40:46.260]  And when you think of where the CBD hemp industry
[40:46.260 --> 40:49.120]  has developed in Colorado and Oregon,
[40:49.120 --> 40:51.880]  that probably has not been a typical problem
[40:51.880 --> 40:53.060]  in those environments.
[40:54.060 --> 40:58.020]  We sampled individual plants in our CBD trial
[40:58.020 --> 41:00.180]  for cannabinoid analysis.
[41:00.180 --> 41:01.420]  So that picture on the left
[41:01.420 --> 41:04.520]  is how we clipped the entire shoot tip there,
[41:04.520 --> 41:06.320]  and we would mill that entire thing.
[41:06.320 --> 41:09.100]  So it includes leaves and stems,
[41:09.100 --> 41:12.260]  as well as the little flower bracts.
[41:12.260 --> 41:13.860]  We harvested whole plants
[41:13.860 --> 41:16.420]  and hung them in the greenhouse to dry.
[41:16.420 --> 41:18.940]  This is pretty typical of how many
[41:18.940 --> 41:21.840]  of the commercial producers did it this year
[41:21.840 --> 41:24.000]  in a barn with lots of fans,
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.960]  and maybe they had some dehydrators going on in there,
[41:27.960 --> 41:29.040]  dehumidifiers.
[41:30.160 --> 41:31.440]  And that's what you get on the end.
[41:31.440 --> 41:34.400]  That picture on the right is dried floral material,
[41:34.400 --> 41:36.600]  which we were then stripping by hand.
[41:36.600 --> 41:39.640]  And again, that was the industry standard at that point.
[41:39.640 --> 41:40.600]  There are some machines
[41:40.600 --> 41:43.400]  that you can run these stems through to strip them off,
[41:44.360 --> 41:46.140]  but a lot of it is handwork.
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.960]  Okay, so let's talk a little bit about CBD biochemistry.
[41:54.960 --> 41:57.720]  CBD and THC, as well as CBC,
[41:57.720 --> 42:00.840]  are all derived from a common precursor, CBGA,
[42:01.880 --> 42:06.880]  which is converted by three highly similar enzymes,
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.160]  THCA synthase, CBDA synthase, and CBCA synthase.
[42:14.160 --> 42:19.160]  They are all over 90% similar at the protein level.
[42:20.440 --> 42:23.180]  So one thing that Jacob is very interested in doing,
[42:23.180 --> 42:26.360]  will be a part of his dissertation research,
[42:26.360 --> 42:28.640]  is to do some directed evolution studies
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.480]  to see what is involved in basically converting
[42:33.480 --> 42:38.480]  a CBDA synthase to a THCA synthase, or a CBCA synthase.
[42:39.080 --> 42:44.080]  Those genes are also highly duplicated in the genome.
[42:45.680 --> 42:50.680]  And I'm gonna show you that actually the distinction
[42:50.680 --> 42:54.600]  between a hemp type plant and a marijuana type plant
[42:54.600 --> 42:59.600]  lies in mutations in the THCA or CBDA synthase genes.
[43:02.420 --> 43:06.000]  So lines with a functional CBDA synthase
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.620]  have non-functional or pseudogenes at THCA synthase.
[43:12.420 --> 43:17.000]  Lines that have a deletion in the CBDA synthase,
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.080]  so a non-functional CBDA synthase,
[43:19.080 --> 43:22.240]  have functional THCA synthases.
[43:22.240 --> 43:27.240]  And we can distinguish those with codominant markers.
[43:29.920 --> 43:32.640]  Okay, so the key thing is that
[43:32.640 --> 43:34.760]  as you're growing these CBD lines,
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.440]  which really have been crosses between hemp and marijuana,
[43:39.440 --> 43:41.760]  you need to make sure that your THC levels
[43:41.760 --> 43:44.660]  do not rise above 0.3.
[43:45.480 --> 43:49.040]  So that is a matter of good farming,
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.440]  because the CBD and THC starts to accumulate
[43:53.440 --> 43:56.200]  at a certain point after the start of flowering
[43:56.200 --> 43:57.460]  in the female flowers.
[44:00.040 --> 44:02.520]  But the THC levels will continue to rise
[44:02.520 --> 44:03.980]  as the plants get older.
[44:06.880 --> 44:08.600]  So we've done all of this work
[44:08.600 --> 44:10.960]  in collaboration with Joss Rose,
[44:10.960 --> 44:13.100]  both with Trevor Yeats, who's in the room,
[44:13.100 --> 44:16.560]  and Glenn Philippe, postdocs of Joss'.
[44:17.480 --> 44:20.040]  So Trevor did all of our 2017 samples,
[44:20.040 --> 44:25.040]  and Glenn analyzed about 1,200 of our samples in 2018.
[44:25.480 --> 44:28.280]  And these are the CBD concentrations
[44:28.280 --> 44:31.860]  that we got from that material, upwards of 8%.
[44:31.860 --> 44:35.080]  Commercially, people are hoping for 10
[44:35.080 --> 44:37.680]  to as high as 14%.
[44:37.680 --> 44:40.880]  So these lines were not really great,
[44:42.140 --> 44:45.680]  averaging 5% CBD.
[44:45.680 --> 44:48.920]  But the bigger issue is that some of these
[44:48.920 --> 44:50.680]  were producing a lot of THC.
[44:51.960 --> 44:55.080]  They had not been stabilized for low THC
[44:55.080 --> 44:57.680]  by these two breeders that I got them from.
[44:57.680 --> 45:02.560]  In fact, you see lines that were close to 3% THC.
[45:05.120 --> 45:07.360]  So we do have a DEA registration
[45:07.360 --> 45:09.520]  for the marijuana drug code.
[45:11.080 --> 45:13.760]  So that's the way I think we can continue
[45:13.760 --> 45:15.040]  to work on these lines,
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.420]  if we have the approval from the state as well.
[45:18.480 --> 45:19.640]  So this is an issue.
[45:22.280 --> 45:24.840]  We also see a diversity of other cannabinoids,
[45:24.840 --> 45:28.080]  CBC and CBG, and there's good evidence
[45:28.080 --> 45:31.160]  that a mixture of cannabinoids
[45:31.160 --> 45:33.640]  also has a pharmacological effect.
[45:33.640 --> 45:36.200]  It's not just purified CBD.
[45:36.200 --> 45:38.800]  That certainly does have certain effect.
[45:38.800 --> 45:41.760]  But a combination of cannabinoids
[45:42.640 --> 45:47.480]  can invoke a different pharmacological effect.
[45:47.480 --> 45:50.240]  So people are very interested in looking at lines
[45:50.240 --> 45:51.680]  with different concentrations
[45:51.680 --> 45:53.720]  of the other minor cannabinoids.
[45:55.100 --> 45:56.420]  So to look at the economics,
[45:56.420 --> 45:58.960]  we also needed to measure biomass yield.
[45:58.960 --> 46:01.560]  So again, we stripped all of those plants by hand,
[46:01.560 --> 46:04.560]  got about double the yield at Bluegrass Lane
[46:04.560 --> 46:06.920]  than we did in Geneva,
[46:06.920 --> 46:09.640]  averaging about a pound per plant,
[46:09.640 --> 46:12.760]  which is, yeah, a pretty good rule of thumb average
[46:12.760 --> 46:13.780]  for the industry.
[46:16.600 --> 46:18.840]  So now that gave us the opportunity
[46:18.840 --> 46:22.800]  to do some overall economic analysis.
[46:22.800 --> 46:25.760]  John Hanchar in CCE did this.
[46:25.760 --> 46:28.040]  So first looking at grain or fiber,
[46:28.040 --> 46:30.080]  he estimated the input costs,
[46:30.080 --> 46:32.840]  the cost of hemp, of grain or fiber seed
[46:32.840 --> 46:35.640]  is about 250 a pound,
[46:35.640 --> 46:38.500]  25,000 seed per pound.
[46:40.960 --> 46:42.480]  So not a dollar per seed.
[46:43.560 --> 46:45.180]  Because he planted a higher density,
[46:45.180 --> 46:48.000]  the fiber input costs are a little bit higher.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.300]  He estimated about 1,000 pounds of grain yield
[46:51.300 --> 46:53.480]  at $1.10 per pound.
[46:53.480 --> 46:58.480]  So $1,100 or so gross revenue for grain,
[46:58.800 --> 47:03.040]  8,000 pounds of dry straw yield at 10 cents a pound,
[47:03.040 --> 47:04.800]  you get about 800.
[47:04.800 --> 47:07.280]  So it's in the range of the revenue
[47:07.280 --> 47:09.720]  that you might get from a current field crop.
[47:09.720 --> 47:12.780]  If you can do a dual purpose grain and fiber harvest,
[47:12.780 --> 47:14.400]  you'll increase your revenues.
[47:15.840 --> 47:17.440]  Okay, here's the gold rush.
[47:19.100 --> 47:22.420]  Growing CBD hemp in that horticultural setting
[47:22.420 --> 47:24.320]  is very labor intensive right now.
[47:24.360 --> 47:27.920]  People are estimating 15 to $20,000
[47:27.920 --> 47:31.960]  of input costs per acre in the cost of seed,
[47:31.960 --> 47:34.280]  all that plastic mulch and irrigation,
[47:34.280 --> 47:36.560]  but a lot of hand labor.
[47:36.560 --> 47:39.520]  The average price for CBD hemp
[47:39.520 --> 47:43.680]  is about $4 per percent CBD per pound.
[47:43.680 --> 47:46.640]  So if you're averaging 10% CBD,
[47:46.640 --> 47:48.800]  you can get about $40 per pound.
[47:49.920 --> 47:52.040]  If you're getting a pound per plant
[47:52.040 --> 47:57.040]  and planting in six by six or six by eight spacing,
[47:57.640 --> 48:00.760]  that's about 1,400 plants to the acre.
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.000]  You're averaging 1,400 pounds at $40 per pound,
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.960]  $56,000 gross revenue per acre.
[48:08.840 --> 48:11.800]  So those are the back of the envelope calculations
[48:11.800 --> 48:14.160]  that people are doing that has encouraged
[48:14.160 --> 48:16.840]  this tripling of hemp acreage every year
[48:16.840 --> 48:18.520]  for the last three years.
[48:18.520 --> 48:22.380]  Net returns of over $20,000 per acre.
[48:24.920 --> 48:26.440]  I don't think that's gonna last
[48:27.520 --> 48:29.160]  because of the labor demands.
[48:29.160 --> 48:31.920]  We can't keep tripling our labor force
[48:31.920 --> 48:33.920]  in this current environment.
[48:33.920 --> 48:35.800]  So I think very quickly,
[48:35.800 --> 48:38.080]  we're gonna move to a cultivation system
[48:38.080 --> 48:40.160]  that is based on field crops,
[48:40.160 --> 48:42.880]  dioecious field crops planted mechanically,
[48:42.880 --> 48:44.240]  harvested mechanically.
[48:45.160 --> 48:46.880]  So we are now breeding,
[48:46.880 --> 48:51.840]  our idiotype is a dual purpose CBD and grain cultivar.
[48:52.840 --> 48:55.080]  If we get a fiber market in New York State,
[48:55.080 --> 48:57.020]  then we'll look at CBD and fiber.
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.960]  But I have already seen commercial harvesting
[49:01.960 --> 49:05.280]  from a combine with a modified conveyor system
[49:05.280 --> 49:07.360]  that collects the fine leafy material
[49:07.360 --> 49:09.760]  off the top of the combine sieve,
[49:09.760 --> 49:11.760]  directs that into a wagon,
[49:11.760 --> 49:14.160]  diverting the straw back on the field
[49:14.980 --> 49:17.140]  and collecting the grain in the bin of the combine.
[49:17.140 --> 49:21.300]  So a dual purpose grain and CBD harvest.
[49:21.300 --> 49:22.660]  And I think we have some material
[49:22.660 --> 49:25.300]  that can help us get to that point.
[49:25.300 --> 49:27.120]  So if you look at this cultivar here,
[49:27.120 --> 49:30.340]  Nebraska feral that we got from a breeder in Oregon,
[49:30.340 --> 49:33.720]  produced about three to 4% CBD,
[49:33.720 --> 49:36.900]  while also producing about 800 pounds to the acre of grain.
[49:38.540 --> 49:40.140]  Some of these other ones,
[49:40.140 --> 49:45.140]  Pewter River and Sterling Gold,
[49:46.740 --> 49:49.180]  also produce decent yields of grain.
[49:49.180 --> 49:52.680]  So we anticipated doing some crosses of those
[49:52.680 --> 49:55.340]  with some of our high CBD lines,
[49:55.340 --> 49:58.700]  like A2R4 and ACDC.
[49:59.600 --> 50:03.560]  The issue that we ran into as Jacob has developed markers
[50:03.560 --> 50:08.420]  for this functional and non-functional CBDA synthase,
[50:08.420 --> 50:13.420]  is we can now predict which lines are marijuana type
[50:13.520 --> 50:15.200]  and which lines are hemp type
[50:15.200 --> 50:18.580]  based on the presence of those functional,
[50:18.580 --> 50:21.920]  non-functional CBDA synthase markers.
[50:21.920 --> 50:24.900]  Initially, he saw very good correlation
[50:24.900 --> 50:28.640]  with THC ratios with those markers.
[50:29.600 --> 50:32.000]  And then when we started looking at populations
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.280]  as we planted them out in the greenhouse to do crosses,
[50:35.300 --> 50:40.300]  we found that Pewter River was over 90% homozygous
[50:40.380 --> 50:44.940]  for the marijuana type, non-functional CBDA synthase.
[50:44.940 --> 50:48.340]  Sterling Gold, I think more than 80%.
[50:48.340 --> 50:51.100]  And only three individuals that were homozygous
[50:51.100 --> 50:53.940]  for the hemp type functional CBDA synthase,
[50:53.940 --> 50:56.060]  here about 15 individuals.
[50:57.180 --> 50:58.860]  So that's what we're selecting for,
[50:58.860 --> 51:02.720]  are the hemp type CBDA synthase genes,
[51:02.720 --> 51:04.220]  and some of those populations,
[51:04.220 --> 51:06.640]  which came out hot in the field,
[51:06.640 --> 51:11.640]  we know had marijuana type THC synthase genes.
[51:13.380 --> 51:16.240]  So we have some initial markers that we can use.
[51:16.240 --> 51:17.800]  We have some initial phenotypes
[51:17.800 --> 51:19.760]  and an idiotype that we're going for.
[51:20.640 --> 51:22.760]  But again, we're learning more about hemp.
[51:22.760 --> 51:25.640]  We have some crazy ideas about developing triploids
[51:25.640 --> 51:28.440]  and developing YY male lines.
[51:28.440 --> 51:32.260]  And so hopefully come back in a few years
[51:33.080 --> 51:35.120]  we'll have some innovative stuff.
[51:35.120 --> 51:38.800]  But right now we're just learning every day.
[51:40.480 --> 51:41.560]  So I'm gonna wrap up.
[51:42.600 --> 51:45.000]  These are our future directions to continue
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.920]  to do outreach to growers in New York
[51:46.920 --> 51:48.440]  by evaluating cultivars.
[51:48.440 --> 51:51.840]  This year, we'll have four CBD trial sites
[51:52.820 --> 51:55.520]  with upwards of 30 different cultivars.
[51:55.520 --> 51:57.000]  We're working with companies
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.660]  to establish certified seed production in New York.
[52:00.600 --> 52:02.320]  Building our germplasm collection,
[52:02.320 --> 52:05.180]  characterizing that for the traits that are important
[52:05.180 --> 52:08.260]  and for genetic diversity.
[52:08.260 --> 52:09.600]  Collaborating with biochemists
[52:09.600 --> 52:12.120]  to characterize cannabinoids and terpenes.
[52:12.120 --> 52:15.200]  And then figuring out what crazy crossing methods
[52:15.200 --> 52:17.680]  we can use, whether we can inbreed
[52:17.680 --> 52:22.440]  and develop hybrid lines or develop sterile lines.
[52:22.440 --> 52:24.940]  Those are the types of things we're starting to look at.
[52:24.940 --> 52:27.360]  And Matthew Willman has been working on transformation
[52:27.380 --> 52:30.780]  for eventual CRISPR transformation, CRISPR modification.
[52:31.660 --> 52:35.600]  But hemp is a challenging crop to grow in tissue culture.
[52:37.580 --> 52:39.820]  So need to thank my funding sources.
[52:39.820 --> 52:42.380]  All of our money so far has come from New York State,
[52:42.380 --> 52:45.120]  Department of Ag and Markets and Empire State Development.
[52:45.120 --> 52:49.340]  And please check out our website and follow me on Twitter.
[52:49.340 --> 52:52.260]  So I'm happy to stop here and take any questions.
[52:52.260 --> 52:53.100]  Thank you.
[52:53.100 --> 53:00.440]  Thank you.
[53:00.440 --> 53:01.280]  Thank you.
[53:01.280 --> 53:02.480]  Hi Larry.
[53:02.480 --> 53:04.480]  Are there quality or purity standards
[53:04.480 --> 53:07.560]  relating to CBD sales in the US?
[53:08.520 --> 53:09.600]  So, yeah.
[53:09.600 --> 53:13.380]  So the question is, are there purity or quality standards?
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.360]  So it's a little bit of a tricky thing
[53:16.360 --> 53:20.800]  because CBD as a prescription medicine
[53:21.680 --> 53:26.680]  is not supposed to be sold outside of prescription,
[53:27.660 --> 53:32.180]  that prescription medicine situation.
[53:32.180 --> 53:35.180]  So the companies that are selling it
[53:35.180 --> 53:37.560]  are selling it as a dietary supplement.
[53:37.560 --> 53:42.560]  And they're not really putting the CBD concentration
[53:43.720 --> 53:45.380]  on their labels.
[53:45.380 --> 53:47.000]  They're putting hemp extract.
[53:49.020 --> 53:52.920]  So no, the bottom line is there really are no standards.
[53:52.920 --> 53:55.220]  It's very iffy.
[53:56.040 --> 53:58.780]  You need to find a brand that you trust
[53:58.780 --> 54:02.040]  that is doing their own internal standard
[54:03.200 --> 54:05.360]  quantification of their products.
[54:05.360 --> 54:07.080]  And it may be a pure CBD product
[54:07.080 --> 54:09.360]  or it may be a full spectrum hemp extract.
[54:12.320 --> 54:16.080]  There are of course very strict pharmacological standards
[54:16.080 --> 54:17.640]  for the prescription medicine.
[54:22.200 --> 54:25.100]  Have you measured inbreeding depression, I guess?
[54:27.200 --> 54:28.400]  We have not.
[54:28.740 --> 54:29.820]  Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[54:29.820 --> 54:32.420]  So I know there are people that have been
[54:33.300 --> 54:36.420]  inbreeding their lines for quite a while
[54:36.420 --> 54:39.060]  and there are F1 hybrids that are marketed,
[54:39.060 --> 54:41.740]  but we have not gotten that far ourselves.
[54:45.500 --> 54:48.780]  Well, I was just wondering about the idiotype
[54:48.780 --> 54:51.580]  of getting CBD and grain.
[54:51.580 --> 54:56.180]  I thought that the pollination reduced the CBD production.
[54:56.180 --> 54:57.020]  Yes.
[54:57.020 --> 54:58.980]  So how, and is there, is it just like an,
[54:59.440 --> 55:01.400]  are there some plants that do both well?
[55:01.400 --> 55:02.800]  Is that kind of the idea?
[55:02.800 --> 55:07.560]  Yeah, so if we kept those lines un-pollinated,
[55:07.560 --> 55:11.240]  they would probably make 8% CBD.
[55:11.240 --> 55:12.760]  But the fact that they're pollinated,
[55:12.760 --> 55:15.720]  it goes down probably the three to 4%.
[55:15.720 --> 55:17.920]  But yeah, I'm not fully convinced
[55:17.920 --> 55:20.900]  that I think there's going to be variation
[55:20.900 --> 55:25.440]  in that decline in CBD production after pollination.
[55:25.440 --> 55:27.860]  If we can get trichome production
[55:27.860 --> 55:32.860]  on a wider diversity of foliar tissue
[55:33.140 --> 55:35.980]  outside of just the floral tissue,
[55:35.980 --> 55:39.500]  then we can maintain higher production of CBD.
[55:40.540 --> 55:43.020]  But it's, the bottom line is how much CBD
[55:43.020 --> 55:44.540]  can you produce per acre?
[55:46.140 --> 55:48.820]  So at a higher density,
[55:48.820 --> 55:51.980]  can you get the same amount of CBD per acre
[55:51.980 --> 55:54.520]  as in a low density horticultural planting
[55:54.540 --> 55:56.700]  where you have high concentration plants?
[56:02.230 --> 56:03.710]  So kind of along those lines,
[56:03.710 --> 56:07.070]  is what is the link between pollination
[56:07.070 --> 56:10.030]  and CDC production?
[56:10.030 --> 56:12.930]  Can you decouple that connection?
[56:14.110 --> 56:16.830]  Exactly, so that's a very good question.
[56:16.830 --> 56:18.190]  Can we decouple?
[56:18.190 --> 56:21.410]  And exactly what is happening upon pollination
[56:21.410 --> 56:22.470]  that's triggering that?
[56:22.470 --> 56:24.030]  I think there's some evidence
[56:24.030 --> 56:26.590]  that the trichomes are physically falling off.
[56:26.590 --> 56:28.030]  Is that right, Jacob?
[56:28.530 --> 56:29.850]  Maybe.
[56:29.850 --> 56:34.170]  So is that it, that you're losing trichomes,
[56:34.170 --> 56:37.690]  or is it a down regulation in the biochemical pathway?
[56:37.690 --> 56:41.170]  We really want to do a time series of RNA-seq experiments
[56:41.170 --> 56:43.370]  to look at the changes in gene expression
[56:44.410 --> 56:49.250]  in a very detailed way through time
[56:49.250 --> 56:51.410]  in the floral maturation process
[56:51.410 --> 56:53.690]  to see if we can figure out what's going on.
[56:56.420 --> 57:00.100]  Is there ploidy variation in tapasitiva,
[57:00.100 --> 57:02.580]  and has anybody thought about making autopolyploids?
[57:02.580 --> 57:06.820]  Yeah, so we are thinking about that a lot
[57:06.820 --> 57:08.780]  because that's what we do in willow.
[57:08.780 --> 57:12.380]  We make triploid willow that grow very well.
[57:12.380 --> 57:16.820]  So Jacob has been very good at mining the literature,
[57:16.820 --> 57:19.980]  and there is some evidence of natural tetraploids
[57:19.980 --> 57:21.660]  in India, I believe.
[57:22.480 --> 57:27.040]  And there was a very recent report out,
[57:27.040 --> 57:29.920]  it's only a preprint right now,
[57:31.160 --> 57:32.320]  that Enandia Labs,
[57:32.320 --> 57:34.800]  which is one of the marijuana companies in Canada,
[57:34.800 --> 57:38.780]  has doubled a genome and generated a tetraploid.
[57:45.920 --> 57:46.760]  Hi.
[57:48.160 --> 57:52.160]  Are there any efforts to leverage the natural diversity
[57:52.180 --> 57:54.540]  in other members of the Canabasia,
[57:54.540 --> 57:56.740]  like hops, for example, for the improvement?
[57:58.180 --> 57:59.500]  Yeah, so the question is,
[57:59.500 --> 58:03.740]  can we interbreed hops into cannabisitiva?
[58:03.740 --> 58:04.820]  Not necessarily interbreed,
[58:04.820 --> 58:07.540]  but just use other genetic resources
[58:07.540 --> 58:09.740]  to maybe understand what's going on and how?
[58:12.300 --> 58:13.860]  Yeah, I don't know a whole lot.
[58:13.860 --> 58:15.060]  I haven't had a whole lot of time
[58:15.060 --> 58:18.180]  to study the botanical diversity of the Canabasia.
[58:18.180 --> 58:20.740]  So I think there are opportunities there,
[58:20.760 --> 58:23.040]  but I'm not sure that,
[58:23.040 --> 58:26.240]  I think there will be crossing barriers there.
[58:26.240 --> 58:27.080]  Yep.
[58:28.240 --> 58:33.240]  More urgently, we're interested in pathogens
[58:33.240 --> 58:36.260]  that can cross over between hops and hemp.
[58:36.260 --> 58:38.760]  And we have some initial concerns about that.
[58:40.440 --> 58:41.920]  Maybe one more question from Ithaca
[58:41.920 --> 58:43.160]  before we go to the Zoom.
[58:44.800 --> 58:48.240]  Just on a related note,
[58:48.240 --> 58:49.720]  are you connecting with the hops industry
[58:49.740 --> 58:54.540]  to look at drying or any post-harvest mechanisms?
[58:54.540 --> 58:55.860]  It seems like they have a pretty good infrastructure
[58:55.860 --> 58:56.700]  already established.
[58:56.700 --> 58:57.540]  Yeah, so the question is,
[58:57.540 --> 59:00.280]  is there some overlap between hops producers
[59:00.280 --> 59:01.120]  and hemp producers?
[59:01.120 --> 59:04.300]  We do have some growers who grow both hops and hemp.
[59:06.220 --> 59:09.360]  I'm not sure that the volume of the hops drying systems
[59:09.360 --> 59:11.460]  will meet the needs of the hemp industry,
[59:11.460 --> 59:13.820]  but yes, people are looking at everything.
[59:14.920 --> 59:18.120]  Tobacco drying system, hay drying systems.
[59:18.140 --> 59:19.700]  It's gotta be low temperature.
[59:21.980 --> 59:23.380]  Okay, we have two questions from Zoom.
[59:23.380 --> 59:24.940]  First from Alfred Huo.
[59:25.900 --> 59:29.060]  He asks, will CBGA affect tissue culture
[59:29.060 --> 59:30.900]  or plant regeneration?
[59:30.900 --> 59:34.380]  Is any research about blocking THC synthase
[59:34.380 --> 59:36.060]  to improve CBD?
[59:36.060 --> 59:40.220]  Right, so yeah, that's certainly one of the targets
[59:40.220 --> 59:44.320]  of genetic modification would be a zero THC line
[59:44.320 --> 59:46.680]  by knocking out THC synthase.
[59:48.120 --> 59:50.380]  It is duplicated in the genome.
[59:50.380 --> 59:53.620]  Some reports are at least seven copies upwards.
[59:53.620 --> 59:56.100]  I think there are reports of 20 to 30 copies
[59:56.100 --> 59:58.100]  of THC synthase.
[59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.340]  But yeah, that is a key sort of golden target
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.260]  would be to knock out THC synthase.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.300]  The other question, I'm not sure we know
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.660]  why hemp is so recalcitrant in tissue culture,
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.680]  but I don't think it's related to cannabinoid biochemistry
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.620]  because that's only produced in the floral trichomes.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.340]  Next from Shelby Ellison.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.980]  How many of the CBD females turned hermaphroditic?
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.820]  Yeah, so hemp, that's a great question.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:31.260]  Hemp is a very fickle plant and regulating its sex.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:36.260]  And we definitely have already seen genotypic differences
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.380]  in how stable a female is.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.840]  We have one line, clonal line in the greenhouse
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.500]  that we've grown for a year under high stress conditions,
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.040]  pot bound, low nutrient,
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.440]  and it has stayed female solidly.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:57.440]  Other lines, you fail to give them perfect water
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.240]  and they'll start making male parts.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.520]  They go hermaphroditic.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400]  Yeah, it'd be very interesting to try to sort out
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.440]  the genetic basis for that.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.440]  And in our CBD trial, I think four of our lines
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.100]  went hermaphroditic.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.660]  And again, it's driving us crazy
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.140]  because there's pollen being produced
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.160]  in the middle of our CBD field.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.420]  Final question from Ken.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.740]  What concentrations of ethylene inhibitors
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:29.400]  work for sex modification of female lines?
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:33.020]  Yeah, so we based our research on a paper
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.140]  that just came out from UConn.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.420]  But we only did, in our experiments,
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.540]  we've only tried it on one line.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.960]  They tried it on three lines and did see differences
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.320]  by genotype and the sensitivity to silver thiosulfate,
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.040]  which is the ethylene inhibitor that they used.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.440]  So I think there are going to be genotypic differences
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.920]  in that hormonal control of flowering,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.880]  which are probably related to the stability
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.740]  of femaleness versus hermaphroditic.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.360]  We also tried, we tried to extend that study
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.900]  by using MCP, which is another commercial inhibitor
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.220]  of ethylene action used in the apple industry.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.860]  Our particular line did not respond to MCP at all,
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.160]  still totally female.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.460]  And we're very interested in taking males
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.140]  and inducing female.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.200]  So we want to do a lot of work.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.700]  We're doing that with Bill Miller in horticulture.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.860]  All right, join me in thanking Larry again.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.540]  Thank you.
