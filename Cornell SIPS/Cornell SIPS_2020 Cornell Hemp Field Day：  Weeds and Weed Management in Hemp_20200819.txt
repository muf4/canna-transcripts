[00:01.080 --> 00:07.580]  Hello, welcome to my talk about weeds and weed management and hemp. My name is Lynn
[00:07.580 --> 00:12.180]  Cisnoski and I'm an assistant professor of weed biology, ecology, and management
[00:12.180 --> 00:19.300]  and specialty crops here at Cornell University. Weeds in any cropping system
[00:19.300 --> 00:23.400]  compete with the crop for water, nutrients, and light and that can
[00:23.400 --> 00:29.400]  directly impact yield quantity and quality. Weeds that become established
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.960]  in crops can alter the microclimates around the plants which can then impact
[00:33.960 --> 00:38.400]  disease development and weeds can actually serve as alternate hosts for
[00:38.400 --> 00:44.040]  both pests and pathogens in crop cropping systems. Vegetation that isn't
[00:44.040 --> 00:49.020]  controlled can reduce the final harvestability of the crop and the
[00:49.020 --> 00:53.440]  absence of any kind of vegetation control chemicals in the hemp crop
[00:53.440 --> 00:59.160]  itself may necessitate the use of multiple and integrated practices to
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.400]  suppress weeds that become established. With respect to integrated weed
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.400]  management in hemp, the first step should always be proper site selection and
[01:09.400 --> 01:13.880]  that means avoiding fields with perennials or extremely high weed
[01:13.880 --> 01:20.040]  densities. If you're going to start clean, make sure to try and stay clean. Always
[01:20.040 --> 01:26.080]  manage and harvest your cleanest fields first. With respect to planting date, you
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.080]  might be able to plant and get ahead of weeds. For example, if the field that
[01:32.080 --> 01:38.240]  you're planting into has a lot of summer emerging weed species, choose an earlier
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.360]  planting date that allows your crop to get up and gives it some kind of
[01:42.360 --> 01:46.480]  competitive advantage against the vegetation it's going to be competing
[01:46.480 --> 01:52.360]  with. Using a stale seedbed technique where you stimulate the germination of
[01:53.080 --> 01:57.840]  weeds and then eliminate emerged seedlings both physically and chemically
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.680]  can be a really useful tool, but understand that not all weeds are going
[02:02.680 --> 02:08.160]  to respond equally well. Species with non-dormant seeds might be better
[02:08.160 --> 02:14.480]  controlled under this strategy as opposed to species with dormant seeds.
[02:14.480 --> 02:19.480]  Make sure that you have the best planting conditions that you can achieve.
[02:19.600 --> 02:24.880]  For instance, making sure you have a nice even seedbed so that you have good
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.680]  soil to seed contact for even germination which will improve the
[02:29.680 --> 02:35.080]  crops competitive ability. Make sure that you plant with appropriate densities to
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.760]  minimize that open space that weeds can then colonize. If you're using
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.880]  transplants, this can be a really useful strategy to give your crop a competitive
[02:45.040 --> 02:50.760]  size advantage over the weeds. Choosing varieties can have an influence on how
[02:50.760 --> 02:56.040]  competitive the crop is as well based on the heights and the branching traits
[02:56.040 --> 03:01.720]  that that varieties possesses. If you're going to be cultivating, make sure you
[03:01.720 --> 03:06.800]  keep your rows as straight as possible to maximize cultivation performance and
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.320]  get the weeds while they are small either at the white thread or the early
[03:12.360 --> 03:18.160]  seedling stages. If you're using plastic mulch, remember that this is still going
[03:18.160 --> 03:23.400]  to require weeding between beds and removing weeds that emerge through the
[03:23.400 --> 03:29.840]  planting holes. So even though herbicides aren't available for use in hemp
[03:29.840 --> 03:34.640]  directly, they're likely to be used in crops that are planted before hemp. And
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.120]  we have to pay attention to this because these products have rotation
[03:39.240 --> 03:45.880]  restrictions on the label and hemp may not be explicitly listed, but the term
[03:45.880 --> 03:54.000]  other crop often is and hemp is going to fall into that other crop category. So if
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.920]  you're interested in understanding the type of plant back restrictions that
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.680]  might be encountered in industrial hemp production, I suggest doing a Google
[04:03.680 --> 04:09.000]  search for the terms Wisconsin, hemp, and rotation restrictions and you're
[04:09.080 --> 04:14.640]  really likely to find this nice handout that was produced by UW-Madison which
[04:14.640 --> 04:20.320]  explicitly looks at the restrictions that are associated with the herbicides
[04:20.320 --> 04:25.280]  that are used in pre-seeding crops.
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.760]  These are some of the rotation restrictions that my colleagues at UW-
[04:29.760 --> 04:34.320]  Madison found across multiple herbicide labels and you can see they're extremely
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.920]  varied in the amount of time that you need to wait before you can plant
[04:38.920 --> 04:44.400]  industrial hemp. For example, for the Fusilade and Select Max labels there was
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.800]  a one month rotation restriction. For something like Pursuit and Mazethipere
[04:49.800 --> 04:55.720]  there was a 40 month rotation restriction. Now understand the list is
[04:55.720 --> 05:00.520]  not inclusive and labels can and do change and it is your responsibility to
[05:00.600 --> 05:05.920]  always consult the labels before making any herbicide application and before
[05:05.920 --> 05:13.160]  planting crops following herbicide applications. Just because we don't have
[05:13.160 --> 05:17.680]  herbicides currently labeled for use in hemp doesn't mean that we aren't looking
[05:17.680 --> 05:23.160]  to see how herbicides affect hemp. We have a lot of herbicide trials that are
[05:23.160 --> 05:28.280]  currently underway in the United States and they're being undertaken for
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.040]  multiple reasons. The first of which is to identify active ingredients that will
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.720]  be safe to use in hemp and to address pest management needs in the US hemp
[05:37.720 --> 05:42.160]  industry. The second reason is to identify herbicides that will be able to
[05:42.160 --> 05:48.160]  control hemp escapes that occur in following crops and the third reason is
[05:48.160 --> 05:53.600]  to characterize herbicide symptomology in the case of herbicide carryover or
[05:53.680 --> 06:00.760]  drift injury. While there's considerable interest in conducting hemp herbicide
[06:00.760 --> 06:07.360]  trials very few have actually made it to formal publication stage yet. The one
[06:07.360 --> 06:11.640]  exception being some work that's been recently undertaken by Michael Flesner's
[06:11.640 --> 06:17.280]  group at Virginia Tech University and this is a really good paper where they
[06:17.280 --> 06:22.560]  evaluated herbicide tolerance of industrial hemp in both greenhouse and
[06:22.560 --> 06:28.720]  field conditions. So the objective of the research that was conducted in
[06:28.720 --> 06:32.800]  Michael Flesner's lab was to test hemp tolerance to both pre-emergence and
[06:32.800 --> 06:37.040]  post-emergence herbicides and when we say pre-emergence herbicides we're
[06:37.040 --> 06:41.640]  talking soil applied herbicides and when we're talking post-emergence we're
[06:41.640 --> 06:46.480]  talking foliar applied herbicides. They did conduct this across years and they
[06:46.480 --> 06:51.800]  did do the studies in both greenhouse and in field trials and what they saw
[06:51.840 --> 06:59.320]  was variability across time and between growing conditions. Although with respect
[06:59.320 --> 07:04.600]  to the results they did find that S-metolachlor was the least injurious of
[07:04.600 --> 07:09.720]  the soil applied herbicides in the field although their greenhouse trials did
[07:09.720 --> 07:14.000]  suggest that other active ingredients may have potential for future research.
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.760]  With respect to the foliar applied herbicides Quazalifop and Cethoxydim
[07:19.800 --> 07:24.840]  which are both grass herbicides were found to be the least injurious of the
[07:24.840 --> 07:32.500]  post products along with clopyrilid and bromoxanil. I'd like you to know that
[07:32.500 --> 07:37.780]  we're also conducting herbicide trials here at Cornell Agrotech. These are the
[07:37.780 --> 07:42.380]  results from a preliminary screening project that we've started to look at
[07:42.380 --> 07:47.060]  the safety of post-emergence or foliar applied herbicides and industrial hemp
[07:47.060 --> 07:52.020]  and you can see that our results largely agree with those that were
[07:52.020 --> 07:57.300]  achieved by Michael Flesner's group. Primarily if we're looking at percent
[07:57.300 --> 08:02.300]  injury the post-emergence herbicides currently in our trial providing the
[08:02.300 --> 08:07.940]  least amount of injury to hemp are clethodim which is a WSSA 1 herbicide
[08:07.940 --> 08:17.020]  clopyramid and bromoxanil. So we plan to continue these herbicide screens both in
[08:17.020 --> 08:22.300]  the greenhouse and under field conditions this fall and in 2021. The
[08:22.300 --> 08:26.140]  previous slide showed you our post-emergence herbicides that we're
[08:26.140 --> 08:29.780]  looking at. We also have a suite of pre-emergence herbicides that we'll be
[08:29.780 --> 08:34.060]  evaluating and again we'll be doing it in both the greenhouse and field
[08:34.060 --> 08:39.020]  conditions. We hope to have some trials describing the impacts of herbicide
[08:39.020 --> 08:46.020]  carryover and drift on crop growth and yield development. We're also hoping to
[08:46.060 --> 08:51.300]  look at the biology of hemp and evaluate its competitiveness with both current
[08:51.300 --> 08:57.060]  weed issues such as velvet leaf, foxtail, bindweed, and nightshade and up-and-coming
[08:57.060 --> 09:04.250]  problems in New York such as Palmer amaranth and water hemp. I'd like to
