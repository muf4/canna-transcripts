[00:00.000 --> 00:07.930]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.930 --> 00:09.610]  All right, hi, everybody.
[00:09.610 --> 00:10.850]  My name is Savannah Shalnut.
[00:10.850 --> 00:13.530]  I'm a second year master's student in Larry Smart's
[00:13.530 --> 00:17.290]  program, and really, my work over the past several years
[00:17.290 --> 00:19.490]  on evaluating different hemp production
[00:19.490 --> 00:20.890]  systems for New York State.
[00:20.890 --> 00:24.050]  So first year, I looked at high density plantings,
[00:24.050 --> 00:25.690]  direct seeded high density plantings.
[00:25.690 --> 00:28.250]  Last year, I was involved with a project
[00:28.250 --> 00:31.170]  sponsored by the New York Farm Viability Institute,
[00:31.170 --> 00:35.050]  and we were evaluating the economic production
[00:35.050 --> 00:37.410]  differences between high tunnels, the outdoors,
[00:37.410 --> 00:38.730]  and greenhouses.
[00:38.730 --> 00:40.450]  And during that trial, we noticed
[00:40.450 --> 00:43.250]  that there was an elevated incidence of powdery mildew
[00:43.250 --> 00:44.490]  in our tunnels.
[00:44.490 --> 00:48.250]  And in order to make high tunnels a really easily
[00:48.250 --> 00:49.850]  manageable system in New York State,
[00:49.850 --> 00:54.810]  we decided to come up with a little fungicide trial
[00:54.810 --> 00:56.890]  to determine what works best for us.
[00:56.890 --> 01:01.070]  So my advisor, Larry, knows somebody from Utah State,
[01:01.470 --> 01:04.350]  and he stated that they thought that applying
[01:04.350 --> 01:07.270]  velocinite, which is a silicon crystal to the soil,
[01:07.270 --> 01:10.790]  might enable us to easily control powdery mildew
[01:10.790 --> 01:12.230]  in our tunnels.
[01:12.230 --> 01:15.630]  And the idea with that is that you apply the silicon one
[01:15.630 --> 01:19.110]  time or twice a year, and you just leave it in the soil.
[01:19.110 --> 01:20.710]  The plant uptakes it into the leaf,
[01:20.710 --> 01:23.390]  and you don't have to worry beyond that.
[01:23.390 --> 01:27.830]  So we decided to use a soil applied silicon treatment.
[01:27.830 --> 01:30.790]  We also have a foliar treatment, which is SoMatrix.
[01:30.990 --> 01:34.190]  And then we wanted to use popular biological control,
[01:34.190 --> 01:36.190]  so we went with Nelstop and Cease.
[01:36.190 --> 01:37.750]  And then we also have Trigo, which
[01:37.750 --> 01:42.190]  is a conventional fungicide.
[01:42.190 --> 01:46.390]  So the reason we chose this layout for this trial
[01:46.390 --> 01:48.390]  is we were initially thinking that we
[01:48.390 --> 01:53.710]  would apply the velocinite or the vancyl twice in the season.
[01:53.710 --> 01:56.230]  But after some further evaluation,
[01:56.230 --> 01:58.190]  we decided we just wanted to do it early season.
[01:58.190 --> 02:00.750]  So that's why the soil is exposed in the plots,
[02:00.750 --> 02:03.710]  because we want easy access to mix in the velocinite
[02:03.710 --> 02:05.070]  throughout the season.
[02:05.070 --> 02:07.390]  Additionally, there's wide spacing between the plants,
[02:07.390 --> 02:09.150]  because I come through here once a week,
[02:09.150 --> 02:11.870]  and I rate each plant for its powdery mildew incidence.
[02:11.870 --> 02:14.230]  So if the leaves are touching each other
[02:14.230 --> 02:16.390]  or the plant's all crossed up, it's
[02:16.390 --> 02:18.310]  difficult to rate for powdery mildew.
[02:18.310 --> 02:21.790]  So that's why we chose this four foot spacing between plants.
[02:21.790 --> 02:25.710]  And we opted with white landscape fabric
[02:25.710 --> 02:27.870]  just to try to keep the heat down in here.
[02:27.870 --> 02:30.370]  I don't know if you've noticed, but it's much hotter in here
[02:30.490 --> 02:31.330]  than it is outside.
[02:31.330 --> 02:35.810]  It's about 90 degrees in here, and it's in the mid-70s outside.
[02:35.810 --> 02:38.530]  And also, I have this exact trial replicated
[02:38.530 --> 02:39.250]  in the grow dome.
[02:39.250 --> 02:42.250]  In the grow dome, it's probably about 95 degrees right now.
[02:42.250 --> 02:44.090]  So it's very warm in there.
[02:44.090 --> 02:46.050]  So powdery mildew, as Allie and Chris
[02:46.050 --> 02:51.290]  were talking about earlier, it is a fungal pathogen of hemp.
[02:51.290 --> 02:53.770]  And basically, how powdery mildew works
[02:53.770 --> 02:56.550]  is that the conidia land on leaf,
[02:56.550 --> 03:00.470]  and it generates a hirsutia, which is basically
[03:00.470 --> 03:02.950]  a little root-like structure that penetrates down
[03:02.950 --> 03:04.430]  into the leaf and acts as sort of,
[03:04.430 --> 03:06.790]  you can think of it rudimentarily as like a straw.
[03:06.790 --> 03:10.710]  And it sucks the nutrients it needs up into the host cell.
[03:10.710 --> 03:16.230]  And so the idea behind applying silicon to the plants
[03:16.230 --> 03:19.870]  is that silicon is an important constituent of plant cell walls,
[03:19.870 --> 03:21.790]  and it helps to strengthen the cell wall.
[03:21.790 --> 03:24.710]  And so if there is a high level of silicon in the plant cell,
[03:24.710 --> 03:26.250]  in theory, you would think it would
[03:26.250 --> 03:28.830]  be more difficult for the powdery mildew
[03:28.830 --> 03:30.790]  to penetrate into the plant.
[03:30.790 --> 03:34.430]  So these plants, we started them in the greenhouse
[03:34.430 --> 03:35.150]  middle of May.
[03:35.150 --> 03:36.850]  They were allowed to grow for four weeks.
[03:36.850 --> 03:38.710]  We transplanted them out, allowed them
[03:38.710 --> 03:41.110]  to grow for five weeks vegetatively.
[03:41.110 --> 03:44.390]  And then we came in and inoculated and sprayed
[03:44.390 --> 03:46.150]  all of our treatments for the first time
[03:46.150 --> 03:47.870]  the day before we inoculated.
[03:47.870 --> 03:50.510]  We inoculated about four weeks ago,
[03:50.510 --> 03:54.390]  and we've been raiding and spraying weekly since then.
[03:54.830 --> 03:56.950]  If you are curious about the rates that we're using,
[03:56.950 --> 04:04.710]  you can use the QR code outside to pull up our sheet here.
[04:04.710 --> 04:05.310]  Yep.
[04:05.310 --> 04:07.510]  And so yeah.
[04:07.510 --> 04:11.110]  So just a little information on how the different products
[04:11.110 --> 04:11.830]  work.
[04:11.830 --> 04:16.550]  Milstop is a sodium bicarbonate, and that
[04:16.550 --> 04:18.310]  works by altering the pH of the leaf.
[04:18.310 --> 04:21.870]  So fungus really likes low pH environments,
[04:21.870 --> 04:23.790]  so it likes more acidic environment.
[04:23.790 --> 04:26.470]  And sodium bicarbonate is basically baking soda.
[04:26.470 --> 04:28.110]  It elevates the pH of the leaf surface
[04:28.110 --> 04:30.670]  and makes it difficult for the powdery mildew to grow.
[04:30.670 --> 04:33.790]  And that's mixed with a strain of bacillus, which is cease.
[04:33.790 --> 04:36.190]  Cease forms a biofilm on the leaf surface
[04:36.190 --> 04:38.270]  and makes it difficult for the powdery mildew
[04:38.270 --> 04:39.790]  to establish itself because it has
[04:39.790 --> 04:41.710]  to compete with another living thing
[04:41.710 --> 04:43.790]  on the surface of the leaf.
[04:43.790 --> 04:45.470]  And then we have trigo.
[04:45.470 --> 04:49.590]  That's a more conventional option there.
[04:49.590 --> 04:51.510]  It's actually only labeled for ornamentals,
[04:51.510 --> 04:54.110]  so since we're not using these plants,
[04:54.110 --> 04:55.550]  we're just looking at them.
[04:55.550 --> 04:56.630]  It's OK to use.
[04:56.630 --> 04:58.110]  And we chose that because we wanted
[04:58.110 --> 05:00.350]  to prove that we could effectively control
[05:00.350 --> 05:01.950]  powdery mildew in the tunnel.
[05:01.950 --> 05:04.970]  And that works by inhibiting the respiratory pathway
[05:04.970 --> 05:05.990]  of the fungus.
[05:05.990 --> 05:08.710]  So that means that it's more difficult for the fungus
[05:08.710 --> 05:12.670]  to create energy when it's on the leaf surface.
[05:12.670 --> 05:15.510]  So so far, we are three weeks into this project.
[05:15.510 --> 05:17.710]  And as you can see, we have plenty of powdery mildew
[05:17.710 --> 05:18.790]  germinating on our leaves.
[05:18.790 --> 05:21.070]  We chose the cultivar white CBG because it's
[05:21.110 --> 05:24.070]  known to be highly susceptible to powdery mildew.
[05:24.070 --> 05:26.830]  And I invite you all to walk around and look and ask
[05:26.830 --> 05:27.390]  questions.
[05:27.390 --> 05:29.390]  You'll notice that there are some differences
[05:29.390 --> 05:30.910]  between the different treatments.
[05:30.910 --> 05:36.790]  This treatment, so each row of plants is a replicate.
[05:36.790 --> 05:39.510]  And so this row right here is labeled very simply
[05:39.510 --> 05:40.630]  so you can see what it is.
[05:40.630 --> 05:42.970]  But if you want to walk around and look at other plots,
[05:42.970 --> 05:45.870]  if you look on that end of the plots, there's a yellow tag.
[05:45.870 --> 05:46.750]  Yeah?
[05:46.750 --> 05:49.250]  Did you start growing them the same time as the eye tunnel?
[05:49.250 --> 05:50.830]  Yes, yeah.
[05:51.830 --> 05:52.630]  I don't know.
[05:52.630 --> 05:55.790]  I invite you all to look at the grow dome.
[05:55.790 --> 05:57.990]  Some of the plants in there are over eight feet tall.
[05:57.990 --> 06:00.030]  So just check it out.
[06:00.030 --> 06:04.270]  But yeah, so just feel free to walk around, look at the plants,
[06:04.270 --> 06:05.790]  ask me any questions you might have.
[06:05.790 --> 06:08.230]  You can go ahead and you can notice some differences
[06:08.230 --> 06:09.610]  between the different treatments.
[06:09.610 --> 06:11.070]  There's nothing concrete right now.
[06:11.070 --> 06:13.670]  But I mean, obviously, the trifloxy strobin,
[06:13.670 --> 06:14.990]  tri-dol is working great.
[06:14.990 --> 06:17.790]  Everything else, there is a little bit of powdery mildew
[06:17.790 --> 06:18.430]  here and there.
[06:18.430 --> 06:21.590]  OK, Savannah, a couple of people have asked me two questions.
[06:21.590 --> 06:24.790]  One, did you start these from seed or cuttings
[06:24.790 --> 06:25.870]  before bringing them out?
[06:25.870 --> 06:29.110]  And the other, why do you think the plants are
[06:29.110 --> 06:30.270]  such different heights?
[06:30.270 --> 06:31.470]  OK, that's a great question.
[06:31.470 --> 06:33.670]  So the question is, did I start the plants
[06:33.670 --> 06:35.270]  from seeds or cuttings?
[06:35.270 --> 06:37.230]  So this is all started from seed.
[06:37.230 --> 06:41.110]  And as we know, when you start from seed, it's a mixed bag.
[06:41.110 --> 06:44.030]  You hope that your plants are stable,
[06:44.030 --> 06:45.490]  but sometimes they're segregating
[06:45.490 --> 06:46.330]  for different traits.
[06:46.570 --> 06:49.490]  Another question is, why are my plants different heights?
[06:49.490 --> 06:51.450]  So if you stand out back here and look,
[06:51.450 --> 06:54.010]  you'll notice that those plants are pretty stunted.
[06:54.010 --> 06:55.370]  These plants are fairly stunted.
[06:55.370 --> 06:56.810]  These are OK size.
[06:56.810 --> 06:59.570]  That is because a week after we planted,
[06:59.570 --> 07:02.530]  the sides of the tibetan had the sides programmed correctly
[07:02.530 --> 07:04.370]  at the time, and it just dumped rain
[07:04.370 --> 07:05.970]  and flooded those outside plots.
[07:05.970 --> 07:09.170]  And it took about two weeks for them to dry out.
[07:09.170 --> 07:14.410]  So yeah, that is from water flooding, stunting right there.
[07:14.410 --> 07:16.010]  And then within the plots, you might
[07:16.010 --> 07:17.330]  notice some variable height.
[07:17.330 --> 07:19.370]  This population of plants is segregating
[07:19.370 --> 07:20.730]  for flowering time.
[07:20.730 --> 07:24.250]  So some of the plants started flowering about three weeks ago,
[07:24.250 --> 07:26.330]  and some of them just started flowering this week.
[07:26.330 --> 07:27.710]  And a few of them, you'll notice,
[07:27.710 --> 07:29.730]  haven't really quite gotten there yet.
[07:29.730 --> 07:32.890]  So obviously, when the plant begins to grow,
[07:32.890 --> 07:36.770]  starts to flower, it ceases its vegetative growth.
[07:36.770 --> 07:40.050]  So that's some of the variable height within the plots.
[07:40.050 --> 07:42.610]  Any other questions real quick?
[07:42.610 --> 07:43.110]  Yes?
[07:43.110 --> 07:45.910]  I was just going to say, are there
[07:45.910 --> 07:49.350]  any anticipated post-harvest quality issues
[07:49.350 --> 07:51.310]  with the silica?
[07:51.310 --> 07:51.830]  Yeah.
[07:51.830 --> 07:56.390]  So the question is, is there any anticipated post-harvest issues,
[07:56.390 --> 07:58.390]  quality issues with the silica?
[07:58.390 --> 08:01.910]  And so we have taken leaf samples
[08:01.910 --> 08:04.470]  from all of our silica plots and the control plot.
[08:04.470 --> 08:06.630]  We're going to compare what the level of silica
[08:06.630 --> 08:08.950]  is in the control and in the leaf,
[08:08.950 --> 08:11.790]  the foliar applied silica and the soil applied silica.
[08:11.830 --> 08:13.510]  And we should be able to evaluate
[08:13.510 --> 08:15.390]  if it's at a safe level from that point
[08:15.390 --> 08:17.630]  and also evaluate how well the plants are
[08:17.630 --> 08:19.670]  able to take up the silica.
[08:19.670 --> 08:22.750]  And we spray the foliar silica weekly.
[08:25.470 --> 08:26.270]  We spray it.
[08:26.270 --> 08:28.070]  Actually, we're going to continue
[08:28.070 --> 08:30.110]  to spray it throughout the extent of this study,
[08:30.110 --> 08:33.870]  so well into flowering.
[08:33.870 --> 08:34.370]  Yes?
[08:34.370 --> 08:34.870]  Hi.
[08:34.870 --> 08:36.870]  What are some of the contributing factors
[08:36.910 --> 08:41.470]  of the size difference in between here and the dome?
[08:41.470 --> 08:41.970]  All right.
[08:41.970 --> 08:42.970]  This is a great question.
[08:42.970 --> 08:44.430]  So the question is, what do I think
[08:44.430 --> 08:47.310]  the contributing factor is between the size difference
[08:47.310 --> 08:48.550]  here and in the dome?
[08:48.550 --> 08:53.030]  And the answer to that question is, so we have, OK,
[08:53.030 --> 08:56.070]  if you look back here, there is a little funny looking arm
[08:56.070 --> 08:57.110]  situation.
[08:57.110 --> 09:00.070]  And that black thing on top is a PAR sensor.
[09:00.070 --> 09:02.790]  And we also have a PAR sensor in the grow dome.
[09:02.790 --> 09:04.310]  So one of the main things I think
[09:04.310 --> 09:06.390]  is that it's much warmer in the grow dome
[09:06.390 --> 09:08.830]  here, and obviously the plants are really enjoying that.
[09:08.830 --> 09:14.070]  The second thing is that the PAR in this area is,
[09:14.070 --> 09:17.430]  there's more PAR as plant available radiation.
[09:17.430 --> 09:20.390]  So that's how much radiation is available for the plant
[09:20.390 --> 09:21.950]  to photosynthesize.
[09:21.950 --> 09:24.510]  PAR is higher in here just by nature of the fact
[09:24.510 --> 09:26.910]  that this is a clear plastic, and the grow dome's covered
[09:26.910 --> 09:28.910]  in white plastic.
[09:28.910 --> 09:31.030]  And if you look in there, there's a greater internode
[09:31.030 --> 09:31.790]  length.
[09:31.790 --> 09:34.150]  And usually when the white level is low,
[09:34.190 --> 09:37.870]  the plants will stretch more to obtain more light.
[09:37.870 --> 09:39.550]  So I think it's a factor of the fact
[09:39.550 --> 09:40.910]  that it's much hotter in there.
[09:40.910 --> 09:42.710]  The plants are very happy with that.
[09:42.710 --> 09:44.310]  Also, there's greater internode length
[09:44.310 --> 09:48.070]  because there's less plant available radiation.
[09:48.070 --> 09:49.310]  Any other questions?
[09:49.310 --> 09:50.670]  Savannah, I have a question.
[09:50.670 --> 09:51.170]  Yes.
[09:51.170 --> 09:53.550]  I have a question about the triangle main length.
[09:53.550 --> 09:56.310]  I know that that label is a systemic,
[09:56.310 --> 10:00.070]  and you can go up to 28 days to do applications on that.
[10:00.070 --> 10:01.670]  So did you go that length?
[10:01.670 --> 10:03.430]  Did you see better results with triangle
[10:03.430 --> 10:05.150]  or is there any phytotoxicity?
[10:05.150 --> 10:05.790]  Great question.
[10:05.790 --> 10:08.990]  So the question is, triangle, which
[10:08.990 --> 10:12.510]  is the more conventional style fungicide, it's labeled.
[10:12.510 --> 10:13.470]  You can spray.
[10:13.470 --> 10:18.670]  You can wait between 28 days to spray the next round of that.
[10:18.670 --> 10:20.950]  And have we seen phytotoxicity, and what have you done?
[10:20.950 --> 10:25.110]  So we opted to go for a two-week interval with our triangle.
[10:25.110 --> 10:27.630]  And we haven't noticed any phytotoxicity yet.
[10:27.630 --> 10:30.590]  We've only sprayed it twice at this point.
[10:30.630 --> 10:34.470]  But we will be noting if there are any effects from that.
[10:34.470 --> 10:36.710]  And it has had excellent control so far.
[10:36.710 --> 10:39.950]  I haven't seen any powdery mildew on any of our trigo plots
[10:39.950 --> 10:42.550]  at any of the four locations where this trial is replicated.
[10:45.510 --> 10:48.030]  Any other questions?
[10:48.030 --> 10:50.270]  How will we publicize your results?
[10:50.270 --> 10:51.630]  That's a great question.
[10:51.630 --> 10:53.550]  I'm not sure.
[10:53.550 --> 10:56.550]  I'm definitely sure that there will be a link to it
[10:56.550 --> 10:57.750]  on the Cornell Hemp website.
[10:57.750 --> 11:00.470]  So feel free to check that out, and maybe Larry
[11:00.550 --> 11:02.950]  will tweet about it when it comes out.
[11:02.950 --> 11:04.950]  Our Chris.
[11:04.950 --> 11:06.510]  All right, any other questions?
[11:06.510 --> 11:08.390]  Who knows the difference, like, country-wise,
[11:08.390 --> 11:11.510]  if there's more or less powdery mildew?
[11:11.510 --> 11:12.750]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[11:12.750 --> 11:15.170]  So one thing that I didn't go over that's really important
[11:15.170 --> 11:18.270]  is that powdery mildew really enjoys it
[11:18.270 --> 11:22.750]  when it's warm, when there's low actual wetness.
[11:22.750 --> 11:24.170]  So it doesn't like a lot of rain,
[11:24.170 --> 11:26.430]  but it likes it when it's very humid.
[11:26.430 --> 11:29.110]  And so it does enjoy this environment
[11:29.110 --> 11:31.550]  because it's warmer than the outdoors,
[11:31.550 --> 11:34.110]  and also because it doesn't rain on the leaves,
[11:34.110 --> 11:36.830]  and because there's high humidity in here.
[11:36.830 --> 11:38.870]  And powdery mildew also really likes it
[11:38.870 --> 11:44.150]  when there's a strong binaural fluctuation in the temperature,
[11:44.150 --> 11:46.430]  so when it's cooler at night and warmer during the day.
[11:46.430 --> 11:48.830]  And in here, it does cool off at nighttime,
[11:48.830 --> 11:53.230]  so it enjoys that aspect of this environment.
[11:53.230 --> 11:55.750]  Yeah, so that's the answer to that question.
[11:55.750 --> 11:58.670]  Any other questions?
[11:58.670 --> 12:01.070]  Before Sebastian is done, I just
[12:01.070 --> 12:05.070]  need to remind you that there is a failing demonstration
[12:05.070 --> 12:17.690]  at the Research North Field at 2.30.
[12:17.690 --> 12:21.170]  This has been a production of Cornell University,
[12:21.170 --> 12:24.210]  on the web at cornell.edu.
