[00:00.640 --> 00:08.210]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.570 --> 00:13.370]  Thank you all so much for joining us today.
[00:13.890 --> 00:17.530]  My name is Zachary Stansel and I am
[00:17.530 --> 00:22.850]  the current USDA Hemp Germplasm Curator.
[00:22.850 --> 00:25.830]  We are absolutely thrilled
[00:25.830 --> 00:28.410]  that you all made a little bit of time today.
[00:28.410 --> 00:33.250]  It's going to be special and it'll be well worth it.
[00:33.370 --> 00:36.850]  I wanted to just quickly tell you a little bit about
[00:36.850 --> 00:41.170]  our work and why we were so excited to host Hemp 411.
[00:41.170 --> 00:44.010]  My team and I run
[00:44.010 --> 00:47.810]  the Hemp Germplasm Repository in beautiful,
[00:47.810 --> 00:50.370]  cold snowy Geneva, New York,
[00:50.370 --> 00:55.250]  which is similar to a library,
[00:55.250 --> 00:58.530]  but it's a library for seeds, which is really fun.
[00:58.530 --> 01:01.370]  The first goal of this work is to protect
[01:01.370 --> 01:03.050]  the genetic diversity of
[01:03.050 --> 01:07.010]  many different kinds of hemp from all over the world.
[01:07.010 --> 01:09.170]  Our second goal is to make
[01:09.170 --> 01:12.130]  these seeds available for science.
[01:12.130 --> 01:14.250]  These seeds, like a library,
[01:14.250 --> 01:16.570]  can be requested by plant scientists,
[01:16.570 --> 01:19.330]  plant breeders, educators.
[01:19.330 --> 01:24.290]  We believe that these seeds hold answers to
[01:24.290 --> 01:26.650]  all kinds of different questions that we
[01:26.650 --> 01:29.770]  would care about while studying hemp.
[01:29.770 --> 01:33.770]  We hope that our work here will allow universities,
[01:33.770 --> 01:37.490]  companies, farmers, and ultimately everyone
[01:37.490 --> 01:42.450]  to benefit from the thousands of potential uses of hemp.
[01:42.450 --> 01:44.770]  During the course of this work,
[01:44.770 --> 01:46.570]  we've met all kinds of
[01:46.570 --> 01:49.610]  interesting dynamic people
[01:49.610 --> 01:51.850]  from across the entire world of hemp,
[01:51.850 --> 01:54.770]  and we wanted to share them with you.
[01:54.770 --> 01:57.250]  We teamed up with some of
[01:57.250 --> 02:00.130]  our good friends at Cornell University
[02:00.130 --> 02:03.210]  to present them with you today.
[02:03.210 --> 02:05.890]  I want to first of all,
[02:05.890 --> 02:07.170]  thank Tony Baracco,
[02:07.170 --> 02:11.810]  who's working on my team and he's done so much of the work for
[02:11.810 --> 02:14.770]  this as well as George Stack,
[02:14.770 --> 02:17.050]  Gemma Osborne, and Ken Paul at the Cornell,
[02:17.050 --> 02:21.490]  who have been just awesome setting up all the logistics.
[02:21.490 --> 02:23.290]  But most of all,
[02:23.330 --> 02:28.010]  I am absolutely thrilled to present our speaker today.
[02:28.010 --> 02:30.970]  Her name is Dr. Heather Grabb,
[02:30.970 --> 02:33.970]  and she has a senior lecture in the School of
[02:33.970 --> 02:38.490]  Integrated Plant Science at Cornell University.
[02:38.490 --> 02:43.450]  Heather delivers best practices for the cultivation and
[02:43.450 --> 02:46.890]  processing of cannabis and hemp to
[02:46.890 --> 02:50.410]  professionals in Cornell's hemp science program.
[02:50.410 --> 02:53.410]  She uses things like remote sensing,
[02:53.410 --> 02:56.330]  large-scale community datasets,
[02:56.330 --> 02:58.810]  and advanced analytical methods to create
[02:58.810 --> 03:01.850]  data-driven solutions for challenges at
[03:01.850 --> 03:07.170]  the interface of natural resource conservation and agriculture.
[03:07.170 --> 03:11.330]  A few things about Heather's work with hemp.
[03:11.330 --> 03:15.970]  She is on the European Industrial Hemp Fiber Working Group.
[03:15.970 --> 03:19.170]  She is on the Education Committee for
[03:19.210 --> 03:21.370]  the Global Hemp Association.
[03:21.370 --> 03:24.250]  She's a member of the Sustainability Committee for
[03:24.250 --> 03:28.930]  the New York State Growers and Processors Association.
[03:28.930 --> 03:31.770]  Also, in conjunction with all of that,
[03:31.770 --> 03:34.210]  Heather is widely known as
[03:34.210 --> 03:36.890]  an absolutely outstanding teacher and mentor
[03:36.890 --> 03:40.050]  for the Cornell Hemp MPS program.
[03:40.050 --> 03:44.770]  I'm going to stop yapping and I bring you Heather Grabb.
[03:45.010 --> 03:50.010]  Thank you, Zach, for that kind introduction.
[03:50.010 --> 03:55.050]  Thanks also to Tony and George and Gemma and others who've
[03:55.050 --> 04:00.330]  been involved in organizing this seminar series.
[04:00.330 --> 04:03.450]  It's a particular pleasure to be here to speak with
[04:03.450 --> 04:06.810]  this group from all over the world.
[04:06.810 --> 04:10.410]  I'm really excited also for the participation
[04:10.410 --> 04:13.130]  of our colleagues from
[04:13.130 --> 04:17.370]  the 1890 land-grant institutions within the US.
[04:17.370 --> 04:19.490]  A special shout out also to
[04:19.490 --> 04:22.530]  the ASL interpreters that are on
[04:22.530 --> 04:26.090]  the call today and providing signing.
[04:26.090 --> 04:28.850]  I think I will probably give them a big challenge.
[04:28.850 --> 04:31.970]  You'll notice many difficult words
[04:31.970 --> 04:34.690]  to begin with on my slide here.
[04:34.690 --> 04:36.490]  If you've tuned in to some of
[04:36.490 --> 04:39.130]  the other sessions that have already launched,
[04:39.130 --> 04:40.850]  you'll know that there are
[04:40.850 --> 04:45.650]  three broad market classes for hemp and we will touch on
[04:45.650 --> 04:47.930]  the processing that's involved in
[04:47.930 --> 04:51.250]  each of those different market classes today.
[04:51.250 --> 04:52.850]  Before we dive in on that,
[04:52.850 --> 04:54.370]  I want to give you just a bit of
[04:54.370 --> 04:58.370]  background information about myself.
[04:58.370 --> 05:02.290]  Zach mentioned, I'm a senior lecturer in
[05:02.290 --> 05:04.930]  hemp science in the School of
[05:04.930 --> 05:08.610]  Integrative Plant Science here at Cornell University,
[05:08.610 --> 05:11.930]  where I teach courses and mentor students in
[05:11.930 --> 05:15.530]  our hemp science MPS program.
[05:15.530 --> 05:17.810]  This is a graduate degree program.
[05:17.810 --> 05:20.570]  It's one year after students have finished
[05:20.570 --> 05:23.890]  their bachelor's degree that helps to develop
[05:23.890 --> 05:25.970]  a workforce that's ready to engage with
[05:25.970 --> 05:28.730]  this rapidly growing hemp industry.
[05:28.730 --> 05:34.170]  Before my role within the hemp science MPS program,
[05:34.170 --> 05:38.210]  I completed my PhD in entomology.
[05:38.210 --> 05:41.570]  My academic background is really in crop protection and
[05:41.570 --> 05:45.290]  particularly in the integrated pest and
[05:45.290 --> 05:48.690]  pollinator management of crop systems.
[05:48.690 --> 05:51.570]  I was lucky enough to work with some students here in
[05:51.570 --> 05:57.050]  our hemp program to catalog the diversity of some insects
[05:57.050 --> 05:59.130]  you might not expect to see visiting
[05:59.130 --> 06:03.330]  hemp crops like these native pollinators.
[06:03.330 --> 06:06.450]  To give you an idea more broadly of this program,
[06:06.490 --> 06:12.250]  it is a one year class intensive master's degree program.
[06:12.250 --> 06:14.410]  One of your organizers,
[06:14.410 --> 06:16.730]  Tony Baracco is an alumnus of our program.
[06:16.730 --> 06:20.530]  I'm so excited that he still is close to us here at
[06:20.530 --> 06:24.810]  Cornell at the hemp germplasm collection,
[06:24.810 --> 06:28.130]  working with Dr. Zach Stancel.
[06:28.130 --> 06:30.330]  Some of the courses that we offer from
[06:30.330 --> 06:32.090]  this program that are really tailored
[06:32.090 --> 06:35.050]  towards hemp and cannabis production include
[06:35.050 --> 06:38.650]  the Cannabis Biology Society Industry Overview course,
[06:38.650 --> 06:40.570]  that gives you an idea for market trends,
[06:40.570 --> 06:43.770]  regulations, business structures within the industry.
[06:43.770 --> 06:45.690]  I teach a class called
[06:45.690 --> 06:49.970]  Hemp Production Systems in the fall semesters.
[06:49.970 --> 06:51.330]  Then in the spring semester,
[06:51.330 --> 06:54.850]  students take courses focused on breeding and genetics,
[06:54.850 --> 06:58.090]  as well as the chemistry and pharmacology of cannabis.
[06:58.090 --> 07:00.170]  Then take another class with me that has
[07:00.170 --> 07:03.690]  a really fun lab called hemp processing.
[07:03.730 --> 07:08.610]  That is what I'm going to give you a sneak peek on in the slides today.
[07:08.610 --> 07:12.970]  I've attempted to cover a semester's worth of content
[07:12.970 --> 07:17.610]  in just one 35-40 minute period here.
[07:17.610 --> 07:20.490]  We're not going to go too deep on any one practice,
[07:20.490 --> 07:24.570]  but really just give you an overview of ideas in the industry.
[07:24.570 --> 07:26.330]  Again, as I mentioned earlier,
[07:26.330 --> 07:31.930]  my academic background is really as an ecologist and as a data scientist.
[07:31.970 --> 07:34.530]  I'm not a chemist and I'm not an engineer,
[07:34.530 --> 07:38.210]  which hopefully means that we won't get too tangled up in
[07:38.210 --> 07:43.370]  the particular terminologies or processing efficiency equations
[07:43.370 --> 07:45.210]  that are really important to the industry.
[07:45.210 --> 07:49.530]  But the goal today is just to give you a broad overview.
[07:49.530 --> 07:53.570]  I think one of the most important points to think about when we are approaching
[07:53.570 --> 07:59.290]  processing is how important it is overall for the industry.
[07:59.330 --> 08:03.250]  I have taken just a brief snapshot here example for
[08:03.250 --> 08:07.050]  New York State where Cornell University is located.
[08:07.050 --> 08:14.410]  This data is supplied by the New York State Department of Ag and Markets,
[08:14.410 --> 08:18.090]  which handles hemp production in New York State.
[08:18.090 --> 08:21.530]  It's from our 2020 growing season.
[08:21.530 --> 08:26.930]  In this season, we had about 25,000 acres of a licensed hemp.
[08:26.970 --> 08:30.610]  Not all of those acres were actually planted or harvested,
[08:30.610 --> 08:32.690]  but that was the amount that was licensed.
[08:32.690 --> 08:41.410]  Among 537 licensed growers with about 99 licensed processors.
[08:41.410 --> 08:45.770]  Using those numbers, we can start to create a picture of what
[08:45.770 --> 08:51.450]  the ratio of growers to processors looks like in New York State.
[08:51.450 --> 08:55.810]  The same equation with some numbers varying is also true for
[08:55.850 --> 09:00.370]  many other states across the US and countries across the world.
[09:00.370 --> 09:04.410]  If we look at these numbers, what they tell us is again,
[09:04.410 --> 09:09.410]  making some assumptions around what was planted and how much in New York State
[09:09.410 --> 09:13.130]  where most of our acres are dedicated to high cannabinoid hemp.
[09:13.130 --> 09:14.650]  I've made an assumption there.
[09:14.650 --> 09:19.730]  We have about 28 growers for every one processor.
[09:19.730 --> 09:24.330]  If we spread those acres evenly among growers,
[09:24.370 --> 09:30.730]  that means each grower has around 50 acres of hemp that's licensed to them.
[09:30.730 --> 09:35.930]  And given the ratio of growers to processors, that means we have about
[09:35.930 --> 09:42.250]  250 acres of hemp production for every licensed processor.
[09:42.250 --> 09:48.170]  Using data that was just released in the new USDA National Hemp Report,
[09:48.170 --> 09:51.850]  we now know that average production of floral hemp and
[09:51.890 --> 09:58.650]  open cultivation was around 1,235 pounds per acre.
[09:58.650 --> 10:03.450]  Meaning that every one of those hemp processors, assuming that average rate
[10:03.450 --> 10:08.210]  of production across all of the acres that they would be responsible for
[10:08.210 --> 10:16.210]  if divided equally, has about 300,000 pounds of flour to process.
[10:16.210 --> 10:21.450]  So focusing on the processing capacity of our cannabinoid hemp processors,
[10:22.050 --> 10:27.210]  if we take for example, a craft processor, so really small scale production,
[10:27.210 --> 10:32.330]  using a supercritical CO2 extraction equipment with 20 liter capacity,
[10:32.330 --> 10:36.570]  can probably process around 40 pounds per day.
[10:36.570 --> 10:42.490]  That means it's gonna take them almost 21 years to get through
[10:42.490 --> 10:47.250]  that one year supply of hemp grown in New York State.
[10:48.250 --> 10:54.330]  And a little bit larger facility with 100 liter supercritical CO2 extractor
[10:54.330 --> 10:59.810]  would still take about 4.2 years to get through their processing supply of
[10:59.810 --> 11:07.730]  cannabinoid hemp, and even the ethanol extractors which have much larger capacity.
[11:07.730 --> 11:12.490]  So something close to 700 pounds per day would still take over a year to
[11:12.490 --> 11:16.530]  process a single year's production within New York State.
[11:16.570 --> 11:20.770]  And what this highlights really is that the producers, and
[11:20.770 --> 11:25.170]  hopefully you tuned in to hear the earlier talks on indoor and
[11:25.170 --> 11:29.970]  outdoor fiber hemp and grain hemp and high cannabinoid hemp production.
[11:29.970 --> 11:33.050]  They've scaled up really rapidly, but
[11:33.050 --> 11:39.010]  we have not seen the same scale and capacity of our processors.
[11:39.010 --> 11:44.170]  So meeting that demand is really critical in developing the hemp industry,
[11:44.210 --> 11:50.250]  whether it's for cannabinoids, fiber or for grain production within the US.
[11:50.250 --> 11:54.850]  So again, hopefully you are very familiar with these different market classes of
[11:54.850 --> 11:58.410]  hemp, but there's a few that we will touch on today.
[11:58.410 --> 12:02.930]  Fiber hemp, as well as hemp that is grown for seed and grain.
[12:02.930 --> 12:07.130]  And then also spend some time talking about high cannabinoid hemp for
[12:07.130 --> 12:12.410]  flower production, as well as some of the processes that extract compounds
[12:12.450 --> 12:16.330]  that are relevant from the flower material.
[12:16.330 --> 12:20.450]  And I just want to start off today because there will be many terms that are
[12:20.450 --> 12:24.330]  unfamiliar to folks with this brief warning, perhaps also for
[12:24.330 --> 12:29.570]  our ASL interpreters, that there's going to be some technical terms still.
[12:29.570 --> 12:34.370]  And those will be heavier on the fiber processing side of things.
[12:34.370 --> 12:38.250]  But I don't want you to get scared and panic or tune out.
[12:38.250 --> 12:40.850]  We'll go slowly through each of these terms and
[12:40.890 --> 12:44.850]  spend some time talking about the anatomical parts of hemp.
[12:44.850 --> 12:47.930]  And then I encourage you, of course,
[12:47.930 --> 12:51.610]  to put your questions for the end in the Q&A.
[12:52.770 --> 12:56.850]  So let's start out with focusing on fiber processing.
[12:56.850 --> 13:02.130]  To understand fiber processing, you have to understand the anatomy of hemp.
[13:02.130 --> 13:08.050]  So what you can see here is an image of a cross section of a fiber hemp stem.
[13:08.090 --> 13:11.970]  And then we can also see sort of an illustrated image that will help us to
[13:11.970 --> 13:14.970]  better understand the key important parts.
[13:14.970 --> 13:19.730]  If we work our way from the outside in, we have the epidermal layer.
[13:19.730 --> 13:22.810]  That's that green portion on the outside of the stem.
[13:22.810 --> 13:24.050]  And just inside of that,
[13:24.050 --> 13:27.490]  we start to hit some of the most important parts of the stem.
[13:27.490 --> 13:30.570]  Those primary vast fiber bundles.
[13:30.570 --> 13:36.730]  These are the portions that are most useful for textile production.
[13:36.730 --> 13:41.490]  Just interior to that, we have some smaller fiber bundles in
[13:41.490 --> 13:46.610]  the plant that are called secondary vast fiber bundles.
[13:46.610 --> 13:48.530]  So these, you'll notice they're smaller.
[13:48.530 --> 13:53.090]  They tend also not to be quite as strong and not as long.
[13:53.090 --> 13:56.050]  So they have different uses and applications.
[13:56.050 --> 14:01.370]  And as a fiber hemp plant matures, we see a higher proportion
[14:01.930 --> 14:08.090]  of those secondary vast fibers compared to the primary vast fiber bundles.
[14:08.090 --> 14:12.530]  Inside of that, we probably have our next most important hemp fiber product.
[14:12.530 --> 14:14.290]  That is called the herd.
[14:14.290 --> 14:19.410]  It's that inner woody core of the plant that we see a lot of development
[14:19.410 --> 14:24.490]  in the cannabinoid hemp fibers and also with grain hemp cultivars that
[14:24.490 --> 14:30.410]  need to hold up heavy inflorescences or inflorescences that are full of grain.
[14:30.410 --> 14:35.770]  But we see somewhat less of these in cultivars that have been bred strongly
[14:35.770 --> 14:38.930]  for textile grade fiber production.
[14:38.930 --> 14:44.090]  So there, they would actually have much more of this hollow inner space inside
[14:44.090 --> 14:46.330]  the stem of the plant.
[14:46.330 --> 14:50.730]  And I mentioned each one of these products has a different set of uses.
[14:50.730 --> 14:55.690]  So those primary vast fiber bundles on the outside of the plant produce
[14:55.690 --> 14:59.370]  that nice spinning textile grade fiber.
[14:59.370 --> 15:05.050]  The secondary vast fibers tend to produce shorter fibers called toe,
[15:05.050 --> 15:09.290]  which we might use for some non-woven applications.
[15:09.290 --> 15:14.330]  And then there's a lot of interest in products being developed from the herd,
[15:14.330 --> 15:18.330]  or also you will see it referred to as shives as well.
[15:19.930 --> 15:25.290]  So this slide here shows you an overview of the process diagram for
[15:25.290 --> 15:27.890]  taking hemp from harvest.
[15:27.930 --> 15:32.050]  So if you heard our very first talk in the series that covered many of
[15:32.050 --> 15:36.130]  the aspects that you would need to think about for fiber hemp production.
[15:36.130 --> 15:39.290]  And we're going to pick up right where that left off and
[15:39.290 --> 15:43.730]  think about what happens after that crop is harvested off the field.
[15:43.730 --> 15:48.450]  How do we turn it into more high value products that are ready to go into
[15:48.450 --> 15:51.890]  different products that we might want to buy?
[15:51.890 --> 15:56.570]  And the very first step for fiber processing is something that's called redding.
[15:56.570 --> 16:01.610]  So redding is a step that involves either the microbial or
[16:01.610 --> 16:06.210]  the chemical breakdown of compounds called pectin,
[16:06.210 --> 16:12.010]  which are sticky gummy compounds that hold together all of those vast
[16:12.010 --> 16:19.970]  fiber bundles and keep them in contact with that inner woody core called the herd.
[16:19.970 --> 16:24.970]  So we want to be able to separate those really cleanly like in this diagram here
[16:25.370 --> 16:29.850]  from the plant and so breaking down the pectins allows us to
[16:29.850 --> 16:36.090]  easily remove those vast fiber bundles from the inner woody core.
[16:36.090 --> 16:40.290]  And there's two different ways that this process is normally achieved.
[16:40.290 --> 16:44.650]  So field redding is one option and we'll talk about that in a second, but
[16:44.650 --> 16:52.210]  there's also water redding as an option for breaking down that pectin material.
[16:52.210 --> 16:57.810]  So this is some illustrations from some scientific publications showing
[16:57.810 --> 17:03.170]  in the first panel here, the microbial community that was associated
[17:03.170 --> 17:11.050]  with the redding of fiber hemp and that includes bacteria as well as fungi.
[17:11.050 --> 17:15.930]  And what this study reported was actually a very large proportion
[17:15.930 --> 17:19.650]  of this community belonged to the proteobacteria,
[17:20.210 --> 17:24.570]  which is pretty stable across the different stages of redding here where each bar
[17:24.570 --> 17:29.970]  represents an individual stage, but we do see some groups that increase
[17:29.970 --> 17:35.050]  in their relative abundance across redding like the bacterioides.
[17:35.050 --> 17:36.970]  So what are these microbes doing to the plant?
[17:36.970 --> 17:40.050]  That's where this other image comes into play here.
[17:40.050 --> 17:45.930]  So we have the inner woody core represented here.
[17:45.930 --> 17:50.930]  And then the outside of the stem is labeled over here, that's the epidermis.
[17:50.930 --> 17:56.490]  And sandwiched in between these two, again, we have these vast fiber bundles.
[17:56.490 --> 18:01.890]  So this first diagram shows us an unredded hemp stem, so
[18:01.890 --> 18:04.170]  fresh harvested off the field.
[18:04.170 --> 18:09.370]  And we see all these fiber bundles are held very tightly together.
[18:09.370 --> 18:14.370]  The next panel shows an additional time step into the redding,
[18:14.410 --> 18:19.250]  where we start to see some spaces beginning to emerge.
[18:19.250 --> 18:26.450]  And then the next two panels show an even further redding process on these stems.
[18:26.450 --> 18:31.810]  So at the final stage here, we see there's a lot of separation that's starting
[18:31.810 --> 18:37.930]  to happen between these vast fiber bundles and also the inner woody core,
[18:37.930 --> 18:40.730]  as well as the epidermal tissue on the plant.
[18:40.730 --> 18:41.890]  So that's really important.
[18:42.890 --> 18:46.690]  That is the microbial or field redding process, but
[18:46.690 --> 18:52.490]  we also see water and tank redding being used in some circumstances.
[18:52.490 --> 18:57.650]  So water redding in open waterways like this is not a very sustainable
[18:57.650 --> 19:01.290]  practice because of the action of the bacteria and
[19:01.290 --> 19:04.810]  the compounds that are leaching from the stems.
[19:04.810 --> 19:09.650]  So we often see redding occurring in these controlled tank environments,
[19:09.650 --> 19:12.330]  where we can apply different microbes or
[19:12.330 --> 19:17.050]  different compounds to help to facilitate that redding action.
[19:17.050 --> 19:21.970]  But it's still not a process that's very widely used in Europe or
[19:21.970 --> 19:27.410]  in the US, where the much more common process we see is field redding or
[19:27.410 --> 19:31.810]  do redding, where right after that fiber is harvested,
[19:31.810 --> 19:36.850]  it's laid down in the field and the natural microbes that occur in
[19:37.810 --> 19:42.250]  the environment as well as on the stem of the plant act to break down
[19:42.250 --> 19:44.010]  the pectin within the stem.
[19:44.010 --> 19:48.250]  So there's a lot to be learned about what the optimal conditions are for
[19:48.250 --> 19:51.010]  redding across different climates throughout the world.
[19:51.010 --> 19:55.450]  And that's something I hope we have more data on soon.
[19:55.450 --> 20:00.890]  So once that fiber material is redded and we're ready to have a separation
[20:00.890 --> 20:06.170]  of the vast fiber bundles from the herd, the next step is a mechanical or
[20:07.090 --> 20:11.450]  physical separation of those bath fibers from the herd through a process
[20:11.450 --> 20:13.650]  called decortication.
[20:13.650 --> 20:18.130]  Decortication is usually achieved by these machines with rollers.
[20:18.130 --> 20:20.810]  So hopefully you can see the video here.
[20:20.810 --> 20:24.570]  This is an example of a small scale fiber processing machine,
[20:24.570 --> 20:27.170]  where you can see their hand feeding.
[20:27.170 --> 20:31.210]  I would not recommend that anybody put their fingers that close to a machine.
[20:31.210 --> 20:33.490]  But you can see what is happening here.
[20:33.490 --> 20:37.650]  These rollers are crushing the plant stem and
[20:37.650 --> 20:43.690]  the inner woody core drops out from the bottom here.
[20:43.690 --> 20:47.170]  And those longer vast fibers come out and
[20:47.170 --> 20:51.330]  collect at the backside of the machine.
[20:51.330 --> 20:55.090]  So we can see them putting these intact hemp stems or
[20:55.090 --> 21:00.290]  hemp straw into the machine and these rollers are crushing the stems.
[21:00.290 --> 21:04.410]  While the herd or shives falls out the bottom and
[21:04.410 --> 21:09.610]  again those long bass fibers are coming out the back of the machine.
[21:14.910 --> 21:19.390]  After that material passes through the decortication step,
[21:19.390 --> 21:22.070]  there's two other steps involved.
[21:22.070 --> 21:26.550]  And these are steps that have been adopted from flax processing.
[21:26.550 --> 21:31.150]  So flax is a similar crop that's grown to produce linen.
[21:31.150 --> 21:35.590]  And these two steps are called scutching and hackling.
[21:35.590 --> 21:41.670]  So scutching is a step that removes all those small pieces of herd or
[21:41.670 --> 21:44.710]  shives as well as some of the toe or
[21:44.710 --> 21:50.790]  the short fibers from the longer vast fiber bundles.
[21:50.790 --> 21:53.390]  And then hackling is the next step.
[21:53.390 --> 21:58.310]  That's a combing process that's used to soften and align the fibers.
[21:58.310 --> 22:03.390]  So the video that I'm going to show next is one of these small scale processing
[22:03.390 --> 22:06.390]  lines that's been developed for flax, but
[22:06.390 --> 22:11.190]  it's also easily adapted for hemp fiber processing.
[22:11.190 --> 22:12.950]  So this is the scutching machine.
[22:12.950 --> 22:17.670]  So again, that's the machine that's going to take any of those residual inner
[22:17.670 --> 22:20.270]  woody herd pieces and remove them.
[22:20.270 --> 22:23.790]  So they'll all be essentially scraped off of the stems.
[22:23.790 --> 22:28.030]  And we also see in this process, a lot of the shorter fibers,
[22:28.750 --> 22:30.510]  flying off of that line.
[22:30.510 --> 22:33.030]  So now we're ready for the hackling step.
[22:33.030 --> 22:37.790]  And this is essentially again, this combing and aligning machine.
[22:37.790 --> 22:41.470]  So here's what one of these small scale machines looks like.
[22:41.470 --> 22:44.430]  That's the fiber that comes out at the end of the process and
[22:44.430 --> 22:45.830]  we'll see it running here.
[22:45.830 --> 22:50.750]  So it's a series of combs that have increasingly tighter
[22:50.750 --> 22:55.950]  spacing of their teeth as we move across the processing line.
[22:56.950 --> 23:00.790]  So once we've finished with our scutching and
[23:00.790 --> 23:04.910]  hackling, we have long spinnable hemp fibers.
[23:04.910 --> 23:10.350]  And across these different steps, we've also separated out some other
[23:10.350 --> 23:15.470]  important products like the herd or shives, as well as the toe.
[23:15.470 --> 23:20.510]  So short non aligned fibers that have many other applications.
[23:20.510 --> 23:25.190]  And there's a huge range of different products that hemp fiber and
[23:25.390 --> 23:29.030]  hemp herds can be incorporated into.
[23:29.030 --> 23:32.310]  I've highlighted just a small set of those here.
[23:32.310 --> 23:37.510]  But composites, for example, are ones that are produced
[23:37.510 --> 23:42.350]  mostly using those herd or shive products.
[23:42.350 --> 23:47.430]  Animal bedding is a huge use right now within the US for herd products.
[23:47.430 --> 23:52.150]  Those non aligned short fibers called toe can be incorporated
[23:52.150 --> 23:54.830]  into products like paper.
[23:54.990 --> 24:01.190]  And those longer aligned hemp fibers can be incorporated into products like ropes
[24:01.190 --> 24:06.830]  or for example, textiles or other technical products even including batteries.
[24:09.750 --> 24:10.950]  So that's fiber.
[24:10.950 --> 24:15.190]  Let's spend some time thinking about hemp grain processing,
[24:15.190 --> 24:18.150]  which has fewer technical sounding terms but
[24:18.150 --> 24:21.670]  somewhat of a complicated process diagram here.
[24:21.710 --> 24:26.710]  So after we've harvested our grain with a combine, and we've cleaned it to remove
[24:26.710 --> 24:31.110]  any of those residual grafts or plant material that could potentially cause
[24:31.110 --> 24:35.630]  spoilage in our grain bins, we've assumed it's all dried down.
[24:35.630 --> 24:38.270]  The processor receives that hemp grain and
[24:38.270 --> 24:41.430]  then has a lot of choices about what to do with it.
[24:41.430 --> 24:46.710]  So one option if you wanted to produce a product like hemp hearts would be to
[24:46.870 --> 24:51.350]  remove those whole hemp seeds and remove the outer hull portion so
[24:51.350 --> 24:55.630]  that we have those yummy hemp hearts and we would put on our yogurt.
[24:55.630 --> 25:00.510]  And that gives us two products, hemp hulls which are high in fiber,
[25:00.510 --> 25:04.110]  as well as the high protein hemp hearts.
[25:04.110 --> 25:10.990]  We might also choose to press for oil and usually that's done from whole hemp seeds,
[25:10.990 --> 25:15.750]  but it can also be done from the hulled hemp hearts.
[25:15.750 --> 25:21.830]  And that gives us again two products, one that's called press cake or seed meat,
[25:21.830 --> 25:27.390]  and another that is unrefined oil that might go on to specialty dressings or
[25:27.390 --> 25:32.310]  could be further refined into other products.
[25:33.510 --> 25:35.550]  So let's look at the steps along the way.
[25:35.550 --> 25:40.190]  The first is the de-hulling step if we wanted to produce hemp hearts.
[25:40.190 --> 25:45.310]  The most common way that we remove those hulls from the heart
[25:45.350 --> 25:51.110]  is using an impact de-huller where the whole hemp grains are introduced
[25:51.110 --> 25:53.790]  through the top of this machine here in the center.
[25:53.790 --> 25:59.110]  And then these paddles are spinning around at very high speeds and
[25:59.110 --> 26:05.950]  they accelerate the individual hemp grains into the side of the equipment here.
[26:05.950 --> 26:11.790]  And essentially that impact of the seed breaking into the side,
[26:12.590 --> 26:15.270]  breaks the hull and releases the heart.
[26:15.270 --> 26:20.430]  There are several other options that are available to de-hull hemp seeds,
[26:20.430 --> 26:24.030]  including bar de-hullers and roller de-hullers.
[26:24.030 --> 26:28.950]  However, hemp does not necessarily always have very uniform size,
[26:28.950 --> 26:34.550]  particularly because it's continuing to mature grain across the season.
[26:34.550 --> 26:39.870]  So you can use some sorting procedures ahead of time to sort out those very small
[26:39.870 --> 26:42.350]  or perhaps even unusually large grains.
[26:42.350 --> 26:47.230]  But impact de-hulling is a great option for hemp seed processing,
[26:47.230 --> 26:52.230]  because it can accommodate some of that variability in seed size.
[26:53.350 --> 26:58.470]  Any of these processes though are going to give you a mix then of
[26:58.470 --> 27:03.310]  hulls together with your hearts, which nobody wants to put on their yogurt in the morning.
[27:03.310 --> 27:07.750]  So it's really important to have a separation step that comes next.
[27:07.790 --> 27:11.230]  And there's a few options here for how you might approach that.
[27:11.230 --> 27:14.270]  One is to use these table separators.
[27:14.270 --> 27:19.870]  So these rely on shaking of angled tables to separate out
[27:19.870 --> 27:24.590]  a mix of materials based on differences in their weight.
[27:24.590 --> 27:28.710]  So lighter materials will come off one end of the table and
[27:28.710 --> 27:31.470]  heavier materials will come off another.
[27:31.470 --> 27:34.710]  And by linking these together in a chain or a series,
[27:34.710 --> 27:40.910]  you actually can make several different separations in one pass.
[27:40.910 --> 27:46.830]  Another option that's great for small scale is pneumatic separation,
[27:46.830 --> 27:52.830]  or essentially using air and gravity together to make that separation
[27:52.830 --> 27:59.430]  based on the size and the surface area of a mixed set of objects.
[27:59.430 --> 28:04.390]  So here these brown points would represent the heavier hearts,
[28:04.390 --> 28:10.150]  and blue points would represent the lighter hulls coming off of your de-hulling line and
[28:10.150 --> 28:13.230]  entering into your separator.
[28:13.230 --> 28:16.870]  And those heavy hearts and hulls drop down from your hopper and
[28:16.870 --> 28:22.870]  are introduced into this chamber where there's a strong flow of air coming through the machine.
[28:22.870 --> 28:31.590]  That air will blow the lighter material with a larger surface area off into a second chamber,
[28:31.590 --> 28:35.430]  where the heavier material will collect in a different one.
[28:35.430 --> 28:38.670]  So there we are achieving that separation.
[28:38.670 --> 28:45.190]  So I mentioned earlier that you might want to take those parts and press them.
[28:45.190 --> 28:50.510]  But again, frequently growers and processors are choosing to put
[28:50.510 --> 28:57.990]  whole hemp seeds into the next step for oil expelling in this case.
[28:57.990 --> 29:03.070]  So having those hulls on can help to increase the friction and the amount of oil
[29:03.070 --> 29:04.830]  that you are able to press out.
[29:04.830 --> 29:11.110]  And most processors are using screw presses at cold conditions,
[29:11.110 --> 29:14.150]  which isn't necessarily cold, it's sort of warm.
[29:14.150 --> 29:18.870]  It's below the threshold for a cold pressed seed oil.
[29:18.870 --> 29:21.830]  And so we start out with introducing seeds into the hopper.
[29:21.830 --> 29:27.830]  And then inside of the barrel of a screw press, we have our expeller screw.
[29:27.830 --> 29:34.950]  So this has increasingly tight spacing and it's rotating across the barrel's length.
[29:34.950 --> 29:42.550]  At the end of the barrel, there's these pores that allow the oil that is pressed out
[29:42.550 --> 29:46.750]  under pressure to be released from the channel.
[29:46.750 --> 29:56.390]  And then all the rest of that product is extruded through the nozzle at the end of the machine.
[29:56.430 --> 30:00.950]  And I'm going to show you a video of what that process looks like at small scale.
[30:00.950 --> 30:04.390]  So this is a hemp seed oil press from a German company.
[30:04.390 --> 30:10.830]  Here you can see those pores in the barrel where the oil is able to come out.
[30:10.830 --> 30:16.270]  They have a temperature probe here monitoring the temperature of that oil to ensure
[30:16.270 --> 30:18.950]  that it is within cold press standards.
[30:18.950 --> 30:21.870]  Because the pressure generated within that barrel and
[30:21.870 --> 30:25.990]  the friction can actually raise the temperature overall.
[30:25.990 --> 30:31.830]  We can change the speed of these machines depending on the attributes of those hemp
[30:31.830 --> 30:37.510]  grain feedstocks that are going in or to try to control the temperature of the machine.
[30:37.510 --> 30:42.390]  And then here at the end, you see the press cake that's coming out.
[30:42.390 --> 30:54.070]  So that is rich in all of those holes and also protein that was not extruded in the oil portion.
[30:54.150 --> 31:01.670]  So again, that's the overview of hemp grain processing going from cleaned and dried whole
[31:01.670 --> 31:09.110]  hemp grains through de-hulling and then also through oil pressing where we end up with
[31:09.110 --> 31:17.750]  that seed cake or seed meal, which can be very high in fiber as well as protein to unrefined
[31:17.750 --> 31:20.310]  oil or even refined oils.
[31:20.310 --> 31:24.870]  And these are used in a wide range of different products.
[31:24.870 --> 31:30.710]  So I'm seeing a lot of beauty and personal care products in stores within the US that
[31:30.710 --> 31:36.070]  are starting to incorporate hemp seed oils for its beneficial properties, as well as
[31:36.070 --> 31:37.830]  hemp seed oil supplements.
[31:37.830 --> 31:43.510]  And it's really important to distinguish that kind of product from what other products that
[31:43.510 --> 31:50.470]  may be labeled as hemp oil extracts that are actually more for the cannabinoid composition
[31:50.470 --> 31:55.350]  of that product, whereas a hemp seed oil should not have cannabinoids present in it.
[31:56.070 --> 32:03.590]  We also see a big, wide range of different food products, the specialty hemp seed oils,
[32:04.230 --> 32:09.990]  hemp hearts I mentioned earlier, as well as that hemp protein, which is derived from
[32:09.990 --> 32:16.390]  the press cake when it's ground up and separated out through some sifting steps.
[32:16.390 --> 32:20.070]  There's a number of new and innovative products I'm excited about.
[32:20.070 --> 32:25.990]  So it was really cool to see folks that are including hemp grain as part of the mash in
[32:25.990 --> 32:28.870]  their distilled products like this one here.
[32:28.870 --> 32:35.030]  And of course, hemp for many, many years has been included as both a pet bird food and
[32:35.030 --> 32:37.750]  a wild bird food ingredient.
[32:37.750 --> 32:42.790]  But we're starting to see a lot more research and hopefully we'll soon see the adoption
[32:42.790 --> 32:48.150]  of hemp grain as livestock and poultry feeds within the US.
[32:51.600 --> 32:57.040]  So on to our last step of the flower processing.
[32:57.040 --> 33:02.800]  So here there's a few different options, but the very first and most important thing after
[33:02.800 --> 33:07.920]  harvest is to make sure that you are stabilizing your product.
[33:07.920 --> 33:10.480]  And that can be achieved in a number of ways.
[33:10.480 --> 33:15.120]  One option is by drying that flower right away while it's still on the stem.
[33:15.680 --> 33:21.120]  Another option that I see a lot of producers using is freezing their product.
[33:21.920 --> 33:27.760]  That flower material, when it's removed from the stem through this process called bucking,
[33:27.760 --> 33:34.000]  which you can do either after that material is dry or even when it's fresh and wet, can
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.240]  then be trimmed for smokable hemp flower products.
[33:38.240 --> 33:43.840]  Or it may go through some milling processes to reduce the size of the flower so that it
[33:43.840 --> 33:50.400]  can be incorporated into other products like pre-rolls or to increase the efficiency of
[33:50.400 --> 33:52.080]  extraction processes.
[33:53.120 --> 33:56.880]  So let's take a look at what drying looks like in practice.
[33:56.880 --> 34:04.560]  There's a lot of growers who choose to dry their hemp biomass or their hemp flower material
[34:04.560 --> 34:10.160]  in protected sort of temporary areas like these coop houses here.
[34:10.160 --> 34:18.240]  So in one case, we have a barrier on the ground, which is great for helping to mitigate any
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.400]  humidity that may be coming up or vapors that are coming up from the ground.
[34:22.400 --> 34:28.080]  In this case, we have a grower who is hanging hemp in a coop house that has open ends and
[34:28.080 --> 34:34.400]  also an open floor, which means that they might need to be thinking very carefully about
[34:34.400 --> 34:38.800]  outdoor weather conditions and managing the humidity in that environment.
[34:38.800 --> 34:45.280]  Because what we do not want to see is any of those post-harvest microbes that can destroy
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.720]  crops and can also cause potentially some unhealthy conditions in the products that
[34:50.720 --> 34:52.080]  are produced from them.
[34:52.080 --> 34:58.560]  So many growers, especially for high value crops, have come to develop these much more
[34:58.560 --> 35:05.040]  controlled conditions indoor where we can monitor airflow, we can monitor humidity and
[35:05.040 --> 35:08.000]  temperature very carefully within the crop.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.720]  One thing you'll also notice here in this example is that the plants have been broken
[35:12.720 --> 35:20.800]  down to individual branches so that there's a lot more uniformity in the drying area compared
[35:20.880 --> 35:27.680]  to the last slide I showed where the interior of the plant here may have a much higher level
[35:27.680 --> 35:34.240]  of humidity and again therefore potentially susceptible to microbial growth within that
[35:34.240 --> 35:34.640]  region.
[35:35.280 --> 35:42.720]  So here they've broken the plant down into individual branches and they've also removed
[35:42.720 --> 35:49.360]  a lot of those big broad fan leaves from the plants to help to facilitate that drying process.
[35:50.080 --> 35:57.920]  Growers that are and processors that are doing really large scale processing might also choose
[35:57.920 --> 36:02.240]  to use some of these faster, higher heat technologies.
[36:02.240 --> 36:09.280]  So in this case, this is an example of a forage dryer that's being used to quickly dry down
[36:09.280 --> 36:15.360]  a large volume of already milled hemp flour here.
[36:15.360 --> 36:17.680]  So these processes are very fast.
[36:17.680 --> 36:23.440]  They can dry out your plant very fast, but they also may come at the cost of losing some
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.240]  of those valuable compounds like terpenes that are quite valuable.
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.600]  In response to that, growers have started to explore other technologies like freeze
[36:33.600 --> 36:34.320]  dryers.
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.640]  There's some very large scale freeze dryer products that are on the market now that operate
[36:40.640 --> 36:47.440]  under a vacuum but at very, very low temperatures in order to supplement the water off of the
[36:47.440 --> 36:48.320]  flour.
[36:48.320 --> 36:53.440]  And they give you a very well preserved, very good color flour product coming out of these.
[36:54.800 --> 37:01.200]  So in terms of removing those flours from the stem, this is an example of what a bucking
[37:01.200 --> 37:06.960]  room might look like where we're removing those inflorescences from the stem that they've
[37:06.960 --> 37:08.320]  been dried on.
[37:08.320 --> 37:15.440]  This is an incredibly labor intensive process and so can cost a large amount of money if
[37:15.440 --> 37:21.040]  you need to employ a staff to process large volumes of hemp flour.
[37:21.040 --> 37:26.240]  And in response to that, the industry has been introducing several innovative products.
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.040]  One that I will show you here is one of these automated bucking machines.
[37:31.040 --> 37:36.400]  So here you can see they're introducing the stem and it's automatically stripping off
[37:36.400 --> 37:44.000]  all of the flour material from the stem using these two rollers here to make that separation.
[37:44.000 --> 37:51.120]  So these machines can be used on dry or on fresh or wet hemp material.
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.920]  So this is just a snapshot of what that looked like for this particular product from Munch
[37:55.920 --> 37:58.480]  Machines called the Mother Bucker.
[37:58.480 --> 38:05.760]  It has two rollers that grab onto the stem but then a hole that makes it so only the
[38:05.760 --> 38:09.680]  stem can go through and none of the flour material which is left behind.
[38:10.160 --> 38:20.230]  So for those processors that want to produce a product for pre-rolls or for extract, one
[38:20.230 --> 38:25.910]  of the next steps in the process before we dive into the extraction itself is size reduction.
[38:25.910 --> 38:31.430]  So they might choose to use a machine like the knife mill that's pictured here that chops
[38:31.430 --> 38:38.790]  up that flour to a very particular size so that we can optimize the efficiency of our
[38:38.790 --> 38:39.830]  extracts.
[38:40.070 --> 38:46.550]  And so again just to leave you with a picture of what this overall process looks like before
[38:46.550 --> 38:51.510]  we continue on and dive in on this extract portion of the talk.
[38:53.670 --> 38:59.670]  So in extracts for high cannabinoid products there's a range of different options and technologies
[39:00.230 --> 39:01.590]  that are available.
[39:02.150 --> 39:07.670]  They broadly fall into two classes, those that are based on solvents and those that
[39:07.670 --> 39:12.230]  are solvent free and based on mechanical separation.
[39:12.230 --> 39:17.830]  So beginning with those solvent based processes I'll give you a process diagram for each
[39:17.830 --> 39:23.270]  one of these and then briefly touch on the pros and cons for each of them.
[39:23.830 --> 39:30.550]  So we'll start out with the highest throughput example which is an ethanol based solvent
[39:30.550 --> 39:31.670]  extraction.
[39:31.670 --> 39:37.830]  So these can be operated at relatively high volumes and ethanol is a compound that is
[39:37.830 --> 39:43.510]  generally considered as a safe product to keep around which allows us to use it at high
[39:43.510 --> 39:44.150]  capacities.
[39:44.150 --> 39:49.270]  This is the same ethanol but a very high proof as what we might find in alcoholic beverages.
[39:50.230 --> 39:53.750]  So we have a large ethanol storage tank area.
[39:54.710 --> 40:02.070]  For optimal extraction conditions these pieces of equipment and systems are operated at extremely
[40:02.070 --> 40:08.470]  cold temperatures and the reason for that is that room temperature ethanol has very
[40:08.470 --> 40:15.830]  low specificity as a solvent which means it's not only going to extract the cannabinoids
[40:15.830 --> 40:22.310]  and terpenes and other compounds you might want but it's also going to co-extract many
[40:22.310 --> 40:27.430]  other compounds like chlorophyll which gives the plants their green color or some of the
[40:27.430 --> 40:33.030]  waxes that are structural in those plants that would need to be cleaned up in post processing.
[40:33.030 --> 40:39.110]  So some of that process can be optimized by keeping your ethanol extraction temperatures
[40:39.110 --> 40:41.430]  extremely cold.
[40:41.430 --> 40:48.550]  So those cooled ethanol storage areas will come into again a chilled extraction vessel.
[40:48.550 --> 40:54.150]  I'm also seeing a lot of centrifuge type systems that spin the ethanol kind of like
[40:54.150 --> 40:59.750]  a washing machine would spin it in order to get all of that ethanol removed from the
[40:59.750 --> 41:03.110]  flour material that's in here when we're finished with our process.
[41:03.990 --> 41:09.990]  And then these come into a collection station and importantly the solvent, the ethanol in
[41:09.990 --> 41:14.070]  this case, needs to be removed from the product.
[41:14.070 --> 41:20.870]  So here's one example of a post processing piece of equipment called a rotary evaporator
[41:20.870 --> 41:28.310]  or rotovap which uses the difference in the boiling point of ethanol versus the boiling
[41:28.310 --> 41:32.310]  points of the compounds of interest like cannabinoids for example.
[41:32.870 --> 41:38.230]  Which so cannabinoids have a much lower or sorry much higher boiling point than ethanol
[41:38.230 --> 41:38.470]  does.
[41:38.470 --> 41:44.950]  So you can set a hot water bath and submerge this globe with your extract into it.
[41:44.950 --> 41:50.550]  You can set that at a temperature that is higher than the boiling point of your ethanol
[41:50.550 --> 41:56.790]  but lower than the boiling point of your cannabinoids so that the ethanol boils off and is
[41:56.790 --> 41:57.750]  collected.
[41:57.750 --> 42:03.670]  You can also do this under vacuum to reduce those boiling points and use less energy.
[42:04.470 --> 42:10.310]  The ethanol is recollected and reintroduced into the system leaving you with your more
[42:10.310 --> 42:13.110]  concentrated hemp extract at the end.
[42:15.350 --> 42:19.430]  So hydrocarbons are one that are increasing in popularity.
[42:19.990 --> 42:27.430]  A pro to these systems is that they have much higher specificity compared to ethanol.
[42:27.430 --> 42:30.790]  They're also very fast in their extraction.
[42:31.270 --> 42:38.950]  A con to these systems though is that they are of course prone potentially to explosion
[42:38.950 --> 42:41.990]  when systems are not well engineered.
[42:41.990 --> 42:48.630]  So of course butane is a really common example of a hydrocarbon that's used in these systems
[42:48.630 --> 42:55.750]  and there are strict regulatory limits about how much butane processing facilities can
[42:55.750 --> 42:56.790]  keep on hand.
[42:57.110 --> 43:02.870]  That sets an upper limit on the overall capacity of hydrocarbon extractors.
[43:02.870 --> 43:08.870]  But for craft extractors, they're a really great solution because of that high specificity.
[43:09.830 --> 43:17.750]  Usually we will keep a reservoir under pressure of our solvent like butane for example that
[43:17.750 --> 43:24.150]  will move in the liquid phase because it's under pressure into our extraction column
[43:24.150 --> 43:27.190]  where our hemp flower material is.
[43:27.190 --> 43:32.950]  It comes out of this column and then through a series of reduced pressure steps, we can
[43:32.950 --> 43:41.270]  first drop out some of the waxes that may have been co-extracted and then finally collect
[43:41.270 --> 43:49.750]  out those cannabinoid and terpene molecules and then resend that solvent back into the
[43:49.750 --> 43:50.150]  system.
[43:50.230 --> 43:59.030]  This is a closed loop system which many jurisdictions are now requiring processors who use these
[43:59.030 --> 44:00.470]  technologies to use.
[44:02.070 --> 44:11.030]  One that is very popular and generally considered safe as well is a supercritical fluid extractor.
[44:11.030 --> 44:15.910]  So here we're not using any explosive or flammable solvents.
[44:15.910 --> 44:19.670]  We're simply using CO2 under high pressure.
[44:19.670 --> 44:25.430]  The safety precaution here though is that this is under extremely high pressures.
[44:25.430 --> 44:29.510]  So these systems need to be very well engineered.
[44:29.510 --> 44:36.870]  And in this case, we take CO2 which is normally a gas and we exert a lot of pressure and also
[44:36.870 --> 44:42.550]  cold temperatures to bring that CO2 to its supercritical point.
[44:42.550 --> 44:49.190]  So this point where it's got properties of both a liquid and a gas and by very precisely
[44:49.190 --> 44:55.670]  controlling the parameters, so the density of that supercritical fluid, we can make very
[44:55.670 --> 45:01.670]  high specificity extracts using supercritical CO2 extractors.
[45:01.670 --> 45:08.310]  The other benefit of these systems is because they're using CO2 as their solvent, that goes
[45:08.310 --> 45:13.430]  back into the atmosphere and we don't need to worry about potential contamination of
[45:13.430 --> 45:15.510]  residual solvents in the system.
[45:16.150 --> 45:22.870]  The con to these systems, in addition to operating at very high pressures, is that they're
[45:22.870 --> 45:27.910]  sort of slow and their overall capacity is somewhat low for that reason.
[45:27.910 --> 45:34.630]  So here we take that highly pressurized supercritical CO2 and we introduce it into our extraction
[45:34.630 --> 45:42.950]  vessel here and it spends several hours interacting with the hemp flower that's in that column
[45:43.750 --> 45:50.470]  and then moves into these separate separation states that has the graduated decrease in
[45:50.470 --> 45:56.390]  pressure in the system until you're left finally with your last fraction, including things
[45:56.390 --> 46:03.830]  like cannabinoids and that CO2 can then be cycled back and reintroduced into the system.
[46:04.710 --> 46:12.230]  One of the lowest tech solvent based options is a classic oil infusion.
[46:12.310 --> 46:18.310]  There's several platforms or technologies that have thought about bringing this up to
[46:18.310 --> 46:26.230]  a much more industrial scale, but simply put, these use an oil, so something like olive
[46:26.230 --> 46:34.790]  oil, for example, you could also use MCT oil or even hemp seed oil in order to extract
[46:34.790 --> 46:40.790]  those lipophilic cannabinoid compounds, that means they like fats, and they'll move into
[46:41.430 --> 46:45.030]  the oil with the addition of heat as a source.
[46:45.030 --> 46:51.350]  So this is sort of a very low tech option, but potentially depending on how high this
[46:51.350 --> 46:58.550]  temperature gets, you might not necessarily meet the safety requirements to kill any microbes
[46:58.550 --> 47:02.070]  that could be contaminating your extract.
[47:02.870 --> 47:08.150]  So I know we're running up low on time here, so I want to move through these other solvent
[47:08.230 --> 47:15.190]  free options that use mechanical force to separate trichomes from the plant material.
[47:15.190 --> 47:21.110]  One of them that's also relatively low tech is a rosin press.
[47:21.670 --> 47:29.430]  So these take hemp flour or the ice water hash products or other trichomes that have
[47:29.430 --> 47:34.790]  been separated and press them at high pressure and with heat between two metal plates.
[47:35.670 --> 47:41.190]  And the cannabinoids and terpenes will flow off of these plates.
[47:41.910 --> 47:49.030]  So you could start out with this hemp flour that's gone through an ice water extraction,
[47:49.030 --> 47:54.630]  so products that come out of this are generally referred to as ice water hash or bubble hash.
[47:54.630 --> 47:59.670]  Here's an example of a large scale option for this mechanical separation, but hemp flour
[47:59.670 --> 48:04.710]  that's frozen is introduced into this ice water bath so that it is maintained at a cold
[48:04.710 --> 48:12.550]  temperature and then agitated either by hand with paddles or through some mechanical process.
[48:12.550 --> 48:18.790]  And then there's a set of filters that will separate out the plant material from those
[48:18.790 --> 48:22.630]  small little trichome heads, which you would be left with at the end.
[48:23.030 --> 48:29.270]  So finally, independent of whatever extraction method you may have applied upstream,
[48:29.270 --> 48:33.910]  there's several additional refinement steps that you could apply.
[48:34.470 --> 48:41.190]  Starting with crude oil, which is in this highest unrefined class that's closest
[48:41.190 --> 48:46.150]  to what was represented in the plant that it was extracted from.
[48:46.150 --> 48:50.710]  This contains a full spectrum of different compounds that we want,
[48:51.670 --> 48:58.150]  but it may also contain a lot of compounds that were co-extracted that we do not want,
[48:58.150 --> 49:01.350]  like the chlorophylls and waxes I mentioned earlier.
[49:01.910 --> 49:08.470]  You could further refine that product using filters, for example, charcoal filters are a great
[49:09.270 --> 49:16.390]  option, as well as a process called winterization, which subjects your extract to some very cold
[49:16.390 --> 49:21.030]  temperatures that precipitate out the waxes from the solution.
[49:21.030 --> 49:27.750]  And you may also at this stage choose to go through some decarboxylation steps that take
[49:27.750 --> 49:34.070]  the cannabinoids from the acidic form that they're found primarily in the plant into their neutral
[49:34.070 --> 49:34.630]  forms.
[49:35.510 --> 49:42.630]  You could further refine your product into a distillate using either a short path distillation,
[49:42.630 --> 49:48.390]  which operates on principles that are very similar to the rotovap I showed you earlier,
[49:48.390 --> 49:54.790]  or through a white film or falling film distillation apparatus.
[49:54.790 --> 49:57.910]  And then finally, we get our most refined products.
[49:57.910 --> 50:04.710]  So these contain a narrow spectrum or even a single cannabinoid or terpene compound
[50:04.710 --> 50:07.110]  at very, very high purity.
[50:07.190 --> 50:13.670]  And these are isolated through chromatography practices and then through crystallization
[50:13.670 --> 50:15.270]  of those products.
[50:15.270 --> 50:20.070]  So I think I've taken up a bunch of time talking and I really want to make sure that we have time
[50:20.070 --> 50:23.030]  to get to our questions for today.
[50:23.030 --> 50:31.190]  So I will leave it here at that slide and feel free, I guess, Tony or George to go ahead and
[50:31.190 --> 50:33.590]  start shooting questions from the audience at me.
[50:34.470 --> 50:38.330]  Yeah, awesome. Great, great talk, Heather.
[50:39.370 --> 50:43.450]  So we have lots of questions in the chat. We'll try to get to as many as we can.
[50:45.770 --> 50:52.250]  Taj Star asks, do you have any experience with using the hemp train as a processor?
[50:52.250 --> 50:54.330]  Are there any caveats? Thank you.
[50:54.330 --> 51:01.290]  So the hemp train, for those who are not in the fiber world, is one of those decortication
[51:02.250 --> 51:10.730]  platforms, but also offers a lot of the separation of those smaller fragments like the toe,
[51:10.730 --> 51:16.090]  as well as the herd, and even separating your herd into different grades.
[51:16.090 --> 51:21.850]  So tiny dust herd versus larger herd that might be suitable for hempcrete, for example.
[51:22.490 --> 51:27.050]  I do not personally have any experience working with a hemp train, but there are
[51:28.010 --> 51:33.370]  several in operation, one of which I think is in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, not too
[51:33.370 --> 51:39.530]  far from us here. So I'm excited to potentially get the chance to see that in action.
[51:42.710 --> 51:48.710]  Great. Another question from Don.
[51:50.790 --> 51:56.950]  Are the hemp grant separators available? If so, what would be the nominal costs?
[51:58.630 --> 52:05.510]  There are separators in terms of the impact de-hutlers or table separators. The brand that
[52:05.510 --> 52:13.670]  we use is Fosberg at our Agritech campus in Geneva, New York, where Tony, Zach, and George
[52:13.670 --> 52:20.390]  are located. We have a full grain processing line from Fosberg there. I do not know off the top of
[52:20.390 --> 52:27.590]  my head exactly the numbers, but the nice thing also is that these are fairly customizable lines
[52:27.590 --> 52:32.070]  where each piece of equipment can be purchased separately and built up. And I know there are
[52:32.070 --> 52:37.110]  even folks in the industry who are using those same pieces of equipment you would use for grain
[52:37.110 --> 52:43.430]  processing to do some sorting of material that comes out of fiber decortication as well.
[52:47.800 --> 52:54.760]  Great. Another question from Mary Urlina asks, grain processing questions, is the equipment
[52:54.760 --> 52:59.480]  fairly standard if you are already a grain farmer slash grain processor or is there
[52:59.480 --> 53:05.720]  specially equipment required for hemp? That's an excellent question and I think it speaks to a
[53:05.720 --> 53:12.680]  broader trend within the industry. So the same equipment that you would use to process other oil
[53:12.680 --> 53:19.080]  seeds can be fairly easily adapted to process hemp grain, which is why we've seen much less of a
[53:19.080 --> 53:27.640]  bottleneck in ramping up hemp grain production compared to hemp fiber production, where sure,
[53:27.640 --> 53:33.000]  we can sort of adapt some of the flax processing equipment, but there's not much of that in the US
[53:33.000 --> 53:38.920]  to begin with. And there's still a whole suite of other optimization steps that we need for fiber
[53:38.920 --> 53:46.600]  processing. So I would say those who are using a screw press to process other oil seed crops
[53:46.600 --> 53:53.400]  would very easily be able to do a little bit of process optimization and to produce some really
[53:53.400 --> 54:03.830]  nice quality hemp seed oil. Awesome. Dr. Sarah Eichler asks, is there more than pectinases at
[54:03.830 --> 54:11.190]  work with fiber redding? Do synthetic pectinases facilitate controlled redding? That is an
[54:11.190 --> 54:18.870]  excellent question. There are surely many other compounds in addition to pectinases. So pectinases
[54:18.870 --> 54:24.710]  are enzymes that break down pectin. There are other compounds that might contribute to the
[54:24.710 --> 54:34.150]  breakdown of lignin as well. And there's a lot of active research going on right now in microbes
[54:34.150 --> 54:40.950]  that may produce some of these interesting compounds that facilitate redding, as well as
[54:40.950 --> 54:47.670]  enzymes that we could just add to controlled redding environments to optimize the quality
[54:47.670 --> 54:56.590]  of the fiber material that's being produced. Fantastic.
[54:59.470 --> 55:05.230]  Question from Gary Fish asks, how safe is ethanol in regards to flammability and worker exposure?
[55:05.310 --> 55:16.270]  Is an ethanol a non-carcinogen? So ethanol is certainly flammable, but unlike hydrocarbons,
[55:16.270 --> 55:24.750]  it's not explosive or extremely volatile. So that does increase the safety. I'm sure there
[55:25.390 --> 55:30.350]  have been studies that have linked ethanol to carcinogenic activity, particularly through
[55:30.350 --> 55:36.750]  prolonged exposure over time. So it is really important when you are working with an equipment
[55:36.750 --> 55:43.470]  supplier to make sure that they have the appropriate process controls in place to safely
[55:43.470 --> 55:49.870]  handle something like ethanol. So it's considered safe in terms of the threshold for allowing this
[55:49.870 --> 55:56.910]  residual solvents into products is relatively high. We consume ethanol in beverages. It's added
[55:56.910 --> 56:02.830]  to pharmaceutical products and it can be found in many other things. So it's safer than hydrocarbons,
[56:02.830 --> 56:08.670]  but there are of course long-term exposure considerations and flammability that do need
[56:08.670 --> 56:22.200]  to be taken into account. Great. Another question from Joy asks, besides chlorophyll and fats and
[56:22.200 --> 56:29.640]  waxes, what else is extracted at room temperature or up to 60 degrees C ethanol extraction?
[56:30.680 --> 56:39.160]  That is an excellent question. There are also many other compounds of interest in hemp, including
[56:39.160 --> 56:47.320]  some flavonoids that could also be extracted using ethanol. It's possible also that you might
[56:47.320 --> 56:53.560]  co-extract some sugars as well from the plant during that ethanol extraction, which is again why
[56:53.560 --> 57:00.200]  we would want to reduce the temperature of our ethanol extractions if what we want to target
[57:00.280 --> 57:12.060]  is the cannabinoids. A question from Don asks, do all hemp grain food products have
[57:12.700 --> 57:19.740]  GRAS, generally recognized as safe status from FDA, and livestock feed status from USDA?
[57:20.780 --> 57:28.060]  So for human consumption, there's a lot more that is permitted. Of course there's always
[57:28.060 --> 57:34.540]  safety considerations in terms of mycotoxins and microbes that may be contaminating hemp grain
[57:34.540 --> 57:40.540]  products, but we've allowed hemp grain products like the ones I showed you earlier, including
[57:40.540 --> 57:48.620]  the pressed hemp seed oils, cake which can be processed into protein powders, and the hemp hearts
[57:48.620 --> 57:54.780]  for human consumption. Those are all considered as appropriate food ingredients and generally
[57:54.780 --> 58:01.420]  recognized as safe. The same is not true for livestock. So there's a separate body that
[58:01.420 --> 58:06.940]  regulates the ingredients that can go into livestock and poultry and make sure that they're
[58:06.940 --> 58:12.780]  safe for the animals as well as safe for the consumers that are going to be purchasing those
[58:12.780 --> 58:19.100]  products. And you know, I know those agencies are actively engaged with the hemp industry right now
[58:19.100 --> 58:24.380]  and working through the process of the research that needs to be conducted to make sure that we
[58:24.380 --> 58:32.700]  are ensuring the safety of those products. So I'm hoping very soon we will have hemp grain and hemp
[58:32.700 --> 58:38.460]  press cake available to feed to livestock because I think that's a really important development
[58:38.460 --> 58:44.860]  overall in the hemp grain market to be able to have access to that, you know, on the off chance
[58:44.860 --> 58:51.820]  that you're not able to send your material to a human food processor that you could divert that
[58:51.820 --> 58:57.660]  and have the secondary market available to you or a secondary market for the byproducts like the
[58:57.660 --> 59:09.700]  press cake that's co-produced in hemp oil production. Awesome. There's been a few
[59:09.700 --> 59:17.300]  questions about your very first infographic that you showed about New York and basically asking
[59:17.300 --> 59:23.380]  the ratio, how was the layout of processors and growers as it mainly can have annoyed fiber grain,
[59:23.380 --> 59:32.980]  what is the outlook on that? So in New York State, very early on in the adoption of hemp by Ag
[59:32.980 --> 59:39.860]  and Markets through our hemp research licensing program, we did have a lot of production of fiber
[59:39.860 --> 59:45.700]  and grain across the state. But subsequently, as licenses became available to more folks within the
[59:45.700 --> 59:53.140]  industry, we saw high cannabinoid hemp really take over a lot of the acres within the state. So
[59:53.140 --> 01:00:01.220]  within the Northeast, that's our predominant crop that we grow. So I'm hoping that we will see
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:08.500]  the introduction of more grain and fiber within the state as our processing capacity is able to
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:16.500]  spool up as well. Awesome. Fantastic. But I think that's all the time we have for questions.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:24.980]  So I just wanted to thank Dr. Grab once again, I feel like she got several months of lectures
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:32.260]  crammed into an hour and answered questions. We had so many today. And we're so grateful for her.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:40.020]  Also want to thank Pam and Chris for translation or interpreting today. That's much appreciated.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:45.940]  And I really want to give a shout out to our friends and collaborators at the 1890 Institutions.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:52.420]  So thank you all so much. And we'll see you in two weeks. Thanks to everyone. If there are any
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:57.220]  questions that we didn't have time to address, please feel free to get in touch with me at my
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:02.420]  email or LinkedIn or other forums. It was such a pleasure to be here to talk with you today.
