[00:00.120 --> 00:08.130]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.130 --> 00:10.050]  So welcome, everybody.
[00:10.050 --> 00:12.290]  Hello. My name is Tony Baracco
[00:12.290 --> 00:15.270]  and I currently assist Zachary Stansel,
[00:15.270 --> 00:18.770]  who is our hemp curator at the USDA ARS.
[00:18.770 --> 00:23.810]  And we help run this hemp germplasm repository,
[00:23.810 --> 00:26.690]  which you can think of as a seed bank.
[00:26.690 --> 00:30.530]  And so our goal is to collect
[00:30.570 --> 00:34.850]  a diverse genetic hemp.
[00:34.850 --> 00:37.210]  And our second goal is to make this
[00:37.210 --> 00:40.290]  diverse population of hemp available.
[00:40.290 --> 00:44.790]  And so all of this information that we gather
[00:44.790 --> 00:47.250]  will be available on Grin Global,
[00:47.250 --> 00:50.770]  and that'll be a tool that researchers and educators
[00:50.770 --> 00:54.010]  can use to replicate findings
[00:54.010 --> 00:57.590]  and have better, reliable information.
[00:57.590 --> 01:02.250]  And so today I would like to introduce our speaker,
[01:02.250 --> 01:03.310]  Ethan Russo.
[01:03.310 --> 01:06.010]  He's a board certified neurologist,
[01:06.010 --> 01:09.110]  psychopharmacology researcher and author.
[01:09.110 --> 01:13.330]  He is the founder and CEO of Kredu Science.
[01:13.330 --> 01:15.430]  Previously, he was the director of research
[01:15.430 --> 01:17.670]  and development of the International Cannabis
[01:17.670 --> 01:21.150]  and Cannabinoids Institute based in Prague, Czech Republic.
[01:22.030 --> 01:24.590]  And he was a medical director of Phytex,
[01:24.590 --> 01:26.730]  a biotechnology company researching
[01:26.730 --> 01:29.050]  and developing innovative approaches
[01:29.050 --> 01:31.970]  to targeting the human endocannabinoid system.
[01:31.970 --> 01:36.470]  And from 2003 to 2014, he served as senior medical advisor,
[01:36.470 --> 01:40.490]  medical monitor and study physician to GW Pharmaceuticals
[01:40.490 --> 01:43.170]  in the United Kingdom for numerous phase one
[01:43.170 --> 01:46.050]  to three clinical trials of Cetevex
[01:46.050 --> 01:48.290]  for alleviation of cancer pain,
[01:48.290 --> 01:51.930]  unresponsive to optimized opioid treatment
[01:51.930 --> 01:53.810]  and initial studies of Epidolex
[01:53.850 --> 01:57.850]  for intractable epilepsy.
[01:57.850 --> 02:00.810]  So without further ado, I'll give Ethan the room
[02:00.810 --> 02:02.290]  and take us away, Ethan.
[02:02.290 --> 02:03.130]  Thank you for joining.
[02:03.130 --> 02:03.950]  So much.
[02:03.950 --> 02:04.870]  It's a pleasure to be with you.
[02:04.870 --> 02:07.890]  I should mention that my late father
[02:07.890 --> 02:11.550]  was an alumnus of Cornell,
[02:11.550 --> 02:14.290]  starting back, I believe in 1938.
[02:15.330 --> 02:18.050]  Anyway, so it's a pleasure to be with you.
[02:18.050 --> 02:20.650]  So I have a difficult task today
[02:20.650 --> 02:23.330]  to sort of summarize the endocannabinoid system
[02:23.850 --> 02:24.850]  and the pharmacology of hemp,
[02:24.850 --> 02:27.330]  but I tried to make this complimentary
[02:27.330 --> 02:29.690]  to other lectures in the series.
[02:29.690 --> 02:31.330]  My email is listed here,
[02:31.330 --> 02:33.170]  and I'd be happy to hear from you
[02:33.170 --> 02:35.050]  with questions subsequently.
[02:36.950 --> 02:38.390]  This is my disclaimer.
[02:38.390 --> 02:40.570]  I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this.
[02:40.570 --> 02:42.690]  I deal with a lot of different companies
[02:42.690 --> 02:44.690]  in one capacity or another.
[02:44.690 --> 02:47.730]  Most of these have not been remunerative
[02:47.730 --> 02:49.490]  and they would have no bearing
[02:49.490 --> 02:52.510]  on the particular content today.
[02:54.330 --> 02:57.170]  The material that I'm gonna discuss
[02:57.170 --> 02:59.690]  is mostly not approved
[02:59.690 --> 03:02.410]  by the US Food and Drug Administration.
[03:02.410 --> 03:05.850]  If people were to use any of these materials,
[03:05.850 --> 03:07.690]  their results might vary.
[03:08.890 --> 03:10.810]  So we're talking, of course,
[03:10.810 --> 03:14.330]  about cannabis sativa, cultivated cannabis.
[03:15.590 --> 03:17.530]  This is how we came to learn
[03:17.530 --> 03:20.570]  of the thing called the endocannabinoid system.
[03:20.610 --> 03:24.090]  So this makes cannabinoids in glandular trichomes
[03:24.090 --> 03:27.250]  on unfertilized female flowering tops
[03:27.250 --> 03:30.010]  that give us tetrahydrocannabinol.
[03:30.010 --> 03:32.570]  And it was through research of this molecule
[03:32.570 --> 03:33.550]  that it was discovered
[03:33.550 --> 03:36.510]  that there were endogenous cannabinoids,
[03:36.510 --> 03:40.010]  particularly anandamide and 2-arachidonoglycerol
[03:40.010 --> 03:43.590]  that actually lodge on cannabinoid receptors.
[03:44.810 --> 03:47.450]  And so these are called endocannabinoids.
[03:48.450 --> 03:52.370]  On the endocannabinoid system
[03:52.370 --> 03:56.970]  is an internal homeostatic regulatory system in chordates.
[03:56.970 --> 03:58.530]  And there are three components.
[03:58.530 --> 04:01.330]  The endogenous cannabinoids is mentioned,
[04:01.330 --> 04:05.810]  the CB1, CB2, and what's called the TRPV1 receptor,
[04:05.810 --> 04:10.810]  probably other receptors such as serotonin 1A receptor.
[04:11.570 --> 04:15.070]  Also includes the regulatory enzymes.
[04:15.070 --> 04:17.210]  In the nervous system,
[04:17.970 --> 04:19.890]  the endocannabinoids are produced on demand
[04:19.890 --> 04:23.650]  and travel in a retrograde fashion to the CB1 receptor
[04:23.650 --> 04:28.090]  where they then inhibit the release of neurotransmitters.
[04:28.090 --> 04:29.010]  In this instance,
[04:29.010 --> 04:31.570]  glutamate is a stimulatory neurotransmitter.
[04:31.570 --> 04:36.570]  So if this is inhibited, there's a net loss of function.
[04:36.610 --> 04:41.610]  If however, there is GABA here,
[04:41.810 --> 04:43.910]  which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
[04:43.910 --> 04:46.210]  the net effect is a stimulation.
[04:47.250 --> 04:49.370]  In the endocannabinoid system,
[04:49.370 --> 04:52.410]  there are probably 98 other molecules
[04:52.410 --> 04:55.930]  that resemble anandamide and 2AG.
[04:55.930 --> 04:59.330]  On these active and inactive components work together
[04:59.330 --> 05:02.010]  in what's been called an entourage effect.
[05:04.730 --> 05:07.810]  The CB1 expression in the brain is extensive.
[05:07.810 --> 05:10.410]  There actually are more CB1 receptors
[05:10.410 --> 05:13.890]  than there are for all the neurotransmitters combined.
[05:13.890 --> 05:17.190]  CB1 is highly expressed in areas of the brain
[05:18.030 --> 05:21.190]  that pertain to pain responses, balance,
[05:21.190 --> 05:24.470]  emotion, and reward pathways.
[05:24.470 --> 05:27.350]  And although it also is in the brainstem,
[05:27.350 --> 05:30.090]  there are barely any cannabinoid receptors
[05:30.090 --> 05:34.390]  in the medullary areas that subserve respiratory drive.
[05:34.390 --> 05:39.230]  And so there is no dose of THC or related cannabinoids
[05:39.230 --> 05:42.490]  that can cause apnea or stopping breathing
[05:42.490 --> 05:44.150]  like the opiates do.
[05:45.070 --> 05:47.790]  The endocannabinoid system is also throughout
[05:47.790 --> 05:49.950]  the other areas of the nervous system,
[05:49.950 --> 05:52.990]  including the spinal cord, the periphery,
[05:52.990 --> 05:55.630]  and the gut, the internervous system.
[05:57.110 --> 06:00.910]  The role of the endocannabinoid system has been summarized
[06:00.910 --> 06:04.110]  as relax, eat, sleep, forget, and protect,
[06:04.110 --> 06:07.630]  but we could provide about 30 other adjectives
[06:07.630 --> 06:09.530]  that would also apply.
[06:09.530 --> 06:13.430]  And so it is the thing that modulates pain, memory,
[06:13.510 --> 06:16.590]  movement, emotion, appetite,
[06:16.590 --> 06:20.310]  whether someone will vomit or not, have a seizure or not,
[06:20.310 --> 06:23.790]  gastrointestinal movement and secretion,
[06:23.790 --> 06:26.050]  and just about any other function.
[06:27.150 --> 06:29.310]  There are also CB2 receptors.
[06:29.310 --> 06:31.290]  These are mainly peripheral.
[06:31.290 --> 06:33.750]  This is a non-psychoactive receptor
[06:33.750 --> 06:38.610]  that modulates immune responses and inflammation.
[06:39.610 --> 06:43.890]  It also has an antifibrotic effect.
[06:43.890 --> 06:47.650]  So there are many conditions where stimulation
[06:47.650 --> 06:49.550]  of this system can be helpful.
[06:52.170 --> 06:57.170]  The CB2 has been typified as a protective system
[06:58.490 --> 07:00.650]  for all these different organs.
[07:00.650 --> 07:04.510]  And we'd single out the liver where stimulation of this
[07:04.510 --> 07:07.210]  would seem to have a role in preventing cirrhosis
[07:07.210 --> 07:10.050]  and other problems in the liver.
[07:12.090 --> 07:16.150]  It's also in the skin, both CB1 and CB2.
[07:16.150 --> 07:18.170]  The familiar cannabidiol,
[07:18.170 --> 07:22.730]  in addition to being anti-inflammatory and bacteriostatic,
[07:22.730 --> 07:26.410]  it works on another receptor called TRPV4
[07:26.410 --> 07:30.770]  and actually inhibits the release of sebum,
[07:30.770 --> 07:33.230]  which is the oily stuff on the skin
[07:33.230 --> 07:37.430]  that is the place where the bacteria
[07:37.430 --> 07:39.250]  that produce acne feed.
[07:41.710 --> 07:43.230]  And again, throughout the body,
[07:43.230 --> 07:45.050]  although this looks like a heartless
[07:45.050 --> 07:47.010]  and spineless individual,
[07:48.330 --> 07:50.590]  all those functions are also subserved
[07:50.590 --> 07:53.710]  and modulated by the endocannabinoid system.
[07:53.710 --> 07:56.030]  In fact, cannabidiol was recently shown
[07:56.030 --> 07:58.230]  to stimulate bone fracture healing
[07:58.230 --> 08:02.110]  and may actually be indicated for athletes in the future
[08:02.110 --> 08:03.610]  if the laws change.
[08:04.910 --> 08:06.590]  Now let's turn to the plant,
[08:06.590 --> 08:10.290]  which I think is gonna be of more interest to this audience.
[08:10.290 --> 08:13.070]  So again, cultivated cannabis,
[08:13.070 --> 08:16.870]  probably the most useful single plant on earth
[08:16.870 --> 08:19.070]  in that it provides food from the seed,
[08:19.070 --> 08:23.310]  fuel from the seed oil, fiber from the stocks and pharmacy,
[08:23.310 --> 08:26.790]  mainly from the infertilized female flowering tops.
[08:26.790 --> 08:28.530]  And this is a diatious annual
[08:28.530 --> 08:30.950]  that's been assigned to the cannabaceae family
[08:30.950 --> 08:33.870]  along with hops and a few others.
[08:35.310 --> 08:36.150]  Oops.
[08:37.750 --> 08:41.350]  There is a chemical typology of cannabis
[08:41.350 --> 08:43.030]  that was developed by Ernest Small
[08:43.030 --> 08:46.310]  going back clear into the 70s.
[08:46.310 --> 08:48.150]  Type one is the more familiar
[08:48.150 --> 08:51.750]  high THC chemovirus chemical varieties.
[08:51.750 --> 08:53.830]  There are no strains in cannabis.
[08:53.830 --> 08:57.230]  Strains are for bacteria and viruses.
[08:57.270 --> 09:01.310]  Type two is mixed generally with THC and CBD
[09:01.310 --> 09:03.270]  of equal proportions.
[09:04.310 --> 09:07.110]  Type three are the CBD predominant chemovirus
[09:07.110 --> 09:08.350]  that have come into the fore
[09:08.350 --> 09:11.070]  particularly since the farm bill.
[09:12.630 --> 09:15.670]  This is from an article a few years back
[09:15.670 --> 09:17.830]  and it shows the different parts of the plants
[09:17.830 --> 09:21.990]  and the heterogeneous production of chemicals
[09:21.990 --> 09:23.750]  in the different parts.
[09:23.750 --> 09:26.950]  Again, the greatest concentration of cannabinoids
[09:27.670 --> 09:29.990]  and monoturpinoids and sesquiterpinoids
[09:29.990 --> 09:32.590]  is in the glandular trichomes
[09:32.590 --> 09:35.590]  of the infertilized female flowering tops.
[09:35.590 --> 09:38.470]  But they're totally different chemicals in the roots,
[09:38.470 --> 09:40.790]  triterpinoids and alkaloids.
[09:40.790 --> 09:45.390]  And in the seeds, we have essential fatty acids,
[09:45.390 --> 09:48.110]  a high quality of dust and protein
[09:48.110 --> 09:52.230]  and their various anti-inflammatory compounds throughout.
[09:55.980 --> 09:58.500]  In terms of the distribution of THC
[09:59.260 --> 10:00.220]  and other cannabinoids,
[10:00.220 --> 10:04.380]  this again is greatest in the Ganja or Sensimia
[10:04.380 --> 10:06.300]  unfertilized female flowering tops,
[10:06.300 --> 10:09.660]  much greater than those that are fertilized
[10:09.660 --> 10:11.860]  and very much higher than the leaves.
[10:11.860 --> 10:14.220]  And there's almost none elsewhere.
[10:18.950 --> 10:22.670]  Close up of the capitate glandular trichomes.
[10:22.670 --> 10:25.190]  These are of the highest volume.
[10:25.190 --> 10:27.670]  These are found on the bracts
[10:27.670 --> 10:30.190]  around the unfertilized female flowers
[10:30.190 --> 10:34.750]  as opposed to sessile trichomes found on the leaves
[10:34.750 --> 10:39.070]  of a much smaller volume, also qualitatively different.
[10:39.070 --> 10:42.590]  These tend to be higher in bitter sesquiterpinoids
[10:42.590 --> 10:46.030]  that discourage grazing,
[10:46.030 --> 10:49.230]  such as by deer and other ungulates.
[10:51.830 --> 10:56.230]  These are the 12 best typified phytocannabinoids.
[10:56.230 --> 10:58.430]  Cannabinoids from plants.
[10:58.430 --> 11:01.310]  We see the familiar THC and cannabidiol.
[11:02.550 --> 11:06.150]  And we've also got the cannabinoid acids
[11:06.150 --> 11:08.510]  that are the precursors in the fresh state.
[11:09.590 --> 11:11.790]  Each of these has unique pharmacology
[11:11.790 --> 11:14.590]  and we'll get into that in a little bit.
[11:16.670 --> 11:19.830]  This is the biosynthetic pathway of the cannabinoids,
[11:19.830 --> 11:22.430]  generally starting with these two precursors,
[11:22.430 --> 11:27.430]  olivetolic acid with a five carbon pentyl side chain
[11:27.630 --> 11:30.150]  and geranyl pyrophosphate.
[11:30.150 --> 11:33.830]  So these start out being the parent compounds
[11:33.830 --> 11:36.270]  for cannabidiolic acid.
[11:36.270 --> 11:39.270]  And subsequently that goes down
[11:39.270 --> 11:42.270]  to tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, THCA,
[11:42.270 --> 11:44.670]  and cannabidiolic acid.
[11:44.670 --> 11:46.590]  Any of these under heat or light
[11:46.590 --> 11:50.910]  will get decarboxylated to the neutral cannabinoids.
[11:50.910 --> 11:54.390]  Now, geranyl pyrophosphate can also react
[11:54.430 --> 11:59.350]  with divarenic acid, which has got a propyl side chain.
[11:59.350 --> 12:02.310]  And this produces the propyl cannabinoids
[12:02.310 --> 12:04.590]  that we see on this slide.
[12:04.590 --> 12:06.910]  Additionally, geranyl pyrophosphate
[12:06.910 --> 12:10.630]  is also the parent compound to the monoterpenoids
[12:10.630 --> 12:13.230]  and the sesquiterpenoids.
[12:13.230 --> 12:18.230]  So the terpenoids and the cannabinoids
[12:18.270 --> 12:20.910]  are both produced in glandular trichomes
[12:20.910 --> 12:24.670]  and they're half siblings based on a common parent.
[12:27.030 --> 12:28.910]  Why does the plant make these?
[12:28.910 --> 12:30.830]  Well, I can tell you,
[12:30.830 --> 12:34.070]  was not put on God's green earth to get people high.
[12:35.390 --> 12:39.190]  Humans are perhaps several hundred thousand years old.
[12:39.190 --> 12:42.430]  This plant is 30 million years old,
[12:42.430 --> 12:45.590]  but the endocannabinoid system has been present
[12:45.590 --> 12:49.670]  in animals for 600 million years.
[12:49.670 --> 12:54.270]  So just to get an idea of the ontogeny of this all.
[12:54.270 --> 12:58.310]  But THC production is greatest in bright light
[12:58.310 --> 13:02.950]  and it may be there to reduce ultraviolet light damage
[13:02.950 --> 13:04.830]  to the genome.
[13:04.830 --> 13:08.150]  CBG and CBD are both antifungal.
[13:08.150 --> 13:12.230]  The trichomes form mechanical insect trap
[13:12.230 --> 13:15.230]  and some of the acid cannabinoids
[13:15.230 --> 13:17.590]  are actually insecticidal.
[13:17.630 --> 13:20.430]  They also produce necrosis in plant cells.
[13:21.550 --> 13:23.710]  A bushy plant at the beginning
[13:23.710 --> 13:27.190]  will prune itself towards the end to look more like this,
[13:27.190 --> 13:28.110]  very lanky.
[13:28.110 --> 13:31.590]  And this is its final efforts at gaining fertilization,
[13:31.590 --> 13:34.230]  which we humans prevent
[13:35.470 --> 13:37.830]  to increase the amount of cannabinoids.
[13:41.020 --> 13:43.700]  So talking about THC.
[13:43.700 --> 13:47.500]  So this obviously is the major psychoactive component
[13:47.540 --> 13:52.540]  of cannabis, not isolated and identified until 1964
[13:52.740 --> 13:55.340]  by Professor Mishulam in Israel,
[13:55.340 --> 13:58.860]  a student still active at age 91.
[13:58.860 --> 14:00.940]  It is a weak partial agonist
[14:00.940 --> 14:03.660]  that both the CB1 and CB2 receptor
[14:04.940 --> 14:09.460]  is pain killing, analgesic, prevents itching,
[14:09.460 --> 14:11.020]  also bronchodilatory.
[14:11.020 --> 14:12.580]  In the 19th century,
[14:14.260 --> 14:17.020]  cannabis cigarettes were used to treat asthma.
[14:17.500 --> 14:20.140]  It's also a neuroprotective antioxidant.
[14:20.140 --> 14:23.540]  It has 20 times the anti-inflammatory power of aspirin
[14:23.540 --> 14:25.780]  and twice that of hydrocortisone.
[14:25.780 --> 14:27.100]  So muscle relaxant,
[14:27.100 --> 14:30.900]  that's the basis for the approval of Sativex
[14:30.900 --> 14:33.820]  in 30 countries to treat spasticity,
[14:33.820 --> 14:38.820]  muscle tightness associated with multiple sclerosis.
[14:39.260 --> 14:41.220]  It's well known as an anti-emetic,
[14:41.220 --> 14:43.140]  helping prevent nausea and vomiting
[14:43.140 --> 14:45.580]  in chemotherapy patients.
[14:45.580 --> 14:48.700]  And it is neither a COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitor
[14:48.700 --> 14:50.780]  like the non-steroidals.
[14:50.780 --> 14:54.100]  A very interesting property is it seems to prevent
[14:55.220 --> 14:59.300]  buildup of beta amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.
[14:59.300 --> 15:03.700]  Cannabidiol is not intoxicating.
[15:03.700 --> 15:05.420]  It is psychoactive, however.
[15:06.260 --> 15:08.580]  Its pharmacology is actually broader,
[15:08.580 --> 15:12.900]  although this is much less potent molecule per molecule.
[15:12.900 --> 15:14.740]  It was isolated in 1940,
[15:14.740 --> 15:18.540]  but only identified positively in 1963.
[15:18.540 --> 15:21.620]  It does not bind directly to the CB1 receptors,
[15:21.620 --> 15:25.540]  but rather is what's called a negative L-steric modulator.
[15:25.540 --> 15:29.020]  It binds to another receptor and affects the binding
[15:29.020 --> 15:34.020]  in a way that reduces the psychoactive effects of THC.
[15:34.540 --> 15:37.780]  Again, a neuroprotective antioxidant.
[15:37.780 --> 15:42.140]  It's stronger than vitamin C or vitamin E in this regard.
[15:42.140 --> 15:47.140]  Like capsaicin, it is an agonist at the TRPV1 receptor
[15:47.420 --> 15:49.980]  with about equal potency.
[15:49.980 --> 15:51.940]  It may desensitize the receptor,
[15:51.940 --> 15:55.180]  which is helpful in pain responses.
[15:55.180 --> 15:59.340]  It also increases the gain of the endocannabinoid system
[15:59.340 --> 16:02.900]  by inhibiting the uptake of anandamide
[16:02.900 --> 16:05.300]  and inhibiting its breakdown.
[16:06.140 --> 16:10.780]  Contrary to popular belief, this is a stimulatory compound.
[16:12.540 --> 16:13.860]  It's an anticonvulsant.
[16:13.860 --> 16:18.740]  This is the basis for its FDA approval as epidiolex
[16:18.740 --> 16:22.340]  in treating Gervais and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.
[16:22.340 --> 16:25.900]  In high doses, it is an anti-anxiety agent.
[16:25.900 --> 16:29.340]  Cannabidiol, like the other cannabinoids,
[16:29.340 --> 16:34.340]  has a cytotoxic effect against multiple cancer cells
[16:34.540 --> 16:37.900]  while at the same time being preservative for normal cells.
[16:37.900 --> 16:42.900]  So this is quite different to conventional pharmacology
[16:45.140 --> 16:50.020]  agents used in chemotherapy that tend to be generally toxic.
[16:51.780 --> 16:52.620]  Oops.
[16:53.740 --> 16:57.340]  It also acts on a thing called tumor necrosis factor alpha,
[16:57.340 --> 17:00.780]  which is important in rheumatoid arthritis,
[17:00.780 --> 17:03.220]  inflammatory bowel diseases,
[17:03.220 --> 17:06.380]  and other autoimmune diseases.
[17:06.420 --> 17:09.220]  Again, not a COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitor.
[17:10.380 --> 17:13.820]  Our group identified this as an agonist
[17:13.820 --> 17:15.820]  at the serotonin 1A receptor,
[17:15.820 --> 17:19.100]  and that's the basis for its effect on anxiety.
[17:19.100 --> 17:21.940]  Also to reduce damage due to strokes
[17:21.940 --> 17:26.700]  and problems in thinking related to liver failure.
[17:28.140 --> 17:30.900]  It also works on the adenosine receptor A2A.
[17:32.300 --> 17:35.260]  May have a role in preventing slow virus infection,
[17:35.420 --> 17:37.460]  and as mentioned previously,
[17:37.460 --> 17:40.260]  stimulates bone fracture healing.
[17:40.260 --> 17:44.100]  Now, there are a lot of misconceptions about cannabidiol.
[17:44.100 --> 17:46.060]  A lot of companies sell products
[17:46.060 --> 17:47.420]  where there's a tiny amount,
[17:47.420 --> 17:50.900]  five milligrams here, 10 milligrams there.
[17:50.900 --> 17:54.500]  Generally, when cannabidiol is used as an isolate,
[17:54.500 --> 17:58.740]  very high doses are needed to have the desirable effects.
[17:58.740 --> 18:03.020]  Again, it's commonly reported to be a sedative,
[18:03.020 --> 18:04.580]  but it's not.
[18:04.580 --> 18:08.060]  The early chemovars available in the US
[18:08.060 --> 18:12.340]  with cannabidiol in them tended to be very high in mercine,
[18:12.340 --> 18:14.860]  a sedating terpene.
[18:14.860 --> 18:19.860]  This produced the misconception that it's sedative.
[18:19.900 --> 18:23.300]  You will hear that this is legal in all 50 states,
[18:23.300 --> 18:25.620]  but this is still a matter of debate.
[18:25.620 --> 18:28.620]  Yes, certain commerce in cannabidiol
[18:28.620 --> 18:33.620]  was allowed under the agriculture farm bill in 2018,
[18:34.020 --> 18:36.780]  but it remains a schedule one product
[18:36.780 --> 18:40.340]  outside of its use as epidiolex.
[18:40.340 --> 18:45.340]  So according to the FDA, it's still illegal.
[18:47.820 --> 18:49.300]  There's also a misconception
[18:49.300 --> 18:52.220]  that it turns to THC in the body.
[18:52.220 --> 18:57.220]  Last year, a group in Brazil had a very interesting trial.
[18:57.300 --> 19:00.500]  They used hundreds of milligrams of pure cannabidiol
[19:00.500 --> 19:02.500]  in a great number of patients
[19:02.500 --> 19:06.060]  and recovered no THC as a metabolite.
[19:07.180 --> 19:11.820]  This is a schematic of the natural history of CBD
[19:11.820 --> 19:13.820]  from a hemp field in Kentucky,
[19:15.180 --> 19:17.540]  showing the glandular trichomes.
[19:18.460 --> 19:23.460]  Then again, the biosynthetic pathway to cannabidiolic acid,
[19:24.220 --> 19:27.180]  which is decarboxylated by heat, light, or aging
[19:27.180 --> 19:29.140]  to produce cannabidiol.
[19:29.140 --> 19:31.780]  This is what the pure crystals look like.
[19:31.820 --> 19:36.820]  And again, in normal hepatic metabolism,
[19:38.700 --> 19:41.180]  we get seven-hydroxy cannabidiol.
[19:41.180 --> 19:43.740]  We don't get THC.
[19:45.580 --> 19:48.260]  Now we're gonna turn to some applications.
[19:49.220 --> 19:50.460]  First, epilepsy.
[19:50.460 --> 19:55.300]  As mentioned, CBD as epidiolex has been approved
[19:56.300 --> 20:01.300]  to treat a couple of rare but important seizure syndromes
[20:02.100 --> 20:04.980]  called Gervain-Lennox-Gastaut syndromes,
[20:04.980 --> 20:07.020]  but at very high doses.
[20:07.020 --> 20:09.820]  THCs can be proconvulsant,
[20:09.820 --> 20:12.340]  produce seizures in rodents at extreme doses,
[20:12.340 --> 20:14.980]  but this is not substantiated in humans.
[20:16.580 --> 20:20.300]  There are other anticonvulsants in cannabis,
[20:20.300 --> 20:22.900]  including tetrahydrocannabivarin,
[20:22.940 --> 20:25.580]  lenolol, which is a terpenoid,
[20:25.580 --> 20:28.580]  and likely tetrahydrocannabinolic acid.
[20:29.980 --> 20:34.980]  Interestingly, although in full-spectrum products,
[20:37.260 --> 20:40.580]  reportedly there've been results in treating seizures
[20:40.580 --> 20:45.580]  that are as good as CBD at about five times the dose.
[20:46.820 --> 20:51.300]  Now, to be fair, epidiolex went through
[20:51.380 --> 20:53.140]  randomized controlled trials,
[20:53.140 --> 20:55.420]  whereas these other preparations,
[20:55.420 --> 20:59.420]  these are observations that were not controlled
[20:59.420 --> 21:00.620]  with placebos.
[21:02.260 --> 21:07.260]  CBD has also been used in treating schizophrenia.
[21:09.620 --> 21:13.780]  THC as cannabis is widely used by psychotic patients,
[21:13.780 --> 21:17.340]  perhaps trying to cover some symptoms.
[21:17.340 --> 21:20.580]  We know that early use in the susceptible patient
[21:20.700 --> 21:25.700]  may precipitate earlier expression of schizophrenia,
[21:26.060 --> 21:29.660]  but only in those with a seeming predisposition.
[21:29.660 --> 21:31.780]  In other words, there's no evidence
[21:31.780 --> 21:34.260]  that you make someone schizophrenic
[21:34.260 --> 21:38.100]  if they did not have a predisposition before that.
[21:39.380 --> 21:43.660]  There've been two phase two randomized controlled trials
[21:43.660 --> 21:46.300]  of CBD at high doses in the 800
[21:46.300 --> 21:49.300]  to a thousand milligram a day range,
[21:49.300 --> 21:53.220]  both effective on positive and negative symptoms
[21:53.220 --> 21:54.820]  of schizophrenia,
[21:54.820 --> 21:59.180]  equivalent to the results with atypical antipsychotics,
[21:59.180 --> 22:01.500]  but with fewer side effects.
[22:01.500 --> 22:04.260]  So this is something that definitely should be pursued.
[22:06.260 --> 22:11.260]  The biosynthetic pathway here is that for cannabigerol,
[22:12.100 --> 22:14.420]  which is the next one I'd like to discuss.
[22:14.420 --> 22:15.820]  And it's particularly pertinent
[22:15.860 --> 22:19.660]  because there are now chemoviruses of cannabis available
[22:19.660 --> 22:24.660]  that are predominantly or solely cannabigerol with no THC.
[22:24.660 --> 22:27.900]  And these can qualify as hemp,
[22:27.900 --> 22:30.740]  quote unquote, under the farm bill.
[22:30.740 --> 22:33.300]  So much as before,
[22:33.300 --> 22:37.220]  we've got olivetolic acid, geranyl pyrophosphate
[22:37.220 --> 22:40.140]  to cannabigerolic acid.
[22:40.140 --> 22:42.100]  Under heat or light,
[22:42.100 --> 22:45.140]  there's decarboxylation to cannabigerol.
[22:45.140 --> 22:50.140]  And this is a picture of a cannabigerol only chemovir
[22:50.140 --> 22:52.140]  from GW Pharmaceuticals.
[22:55.060 --> 22:58.980]  The science of CBG has been less investigated,
[22:58.980 --> 23:02.140]  but it's very compelling.
[23:02.140 --> 23:06.060]  This is first isolated in 1964 from Lebanese Hashish,
[23:06.060 --> 23:08.380]  again by Professor Mashulam.
[23:08.380 --> 23:09.900]  They call this the missing link
[23:09.900 --> 23:12.980]  in the plant synthesis cannabinoid constituents.
[23:13.020 --> 23:15.020]  And it is the precursor to the others.
[23:16.260 --> 23:18.780]  Initial studies really didn't show much
[23:18.780 --> 23:21.100]  in the animal studies.
[23:22.580 --> 23:25.620]  It was synthesized in 1971.
[23:25.620 --> 23:29.100]  This was shown to be a GABA uptake inhibitor
[23:29.100 --> 23:32.100]  that could explain some of the roles
[23:32.100 --> 23:36.540]  as a muscle relaxant and anti-anxiety agent.
[23:36.540 --> 23:38.900]  It has antifungal properties.
[23:38.900 --> 23:41.980]  It has analgesic painkilling properties.
[23:41.980 --> 23:46.180]  Like TAC, it may lower pressure in the eye on glaucoma,
[23:46.180 --> 23:48.900]  although these are greasy molecules
[23:48.900 --> 23:53.260]  and nobody's figured out how to apply it directly,
[23:53.260 --> 23:54.260]  effectively.
[23:56.100 --> 23:59.260]  And there were painkilling properties
[23:59.260 --> 24:01.660]  that were noted in this experiment.
[24:01.660 --> 24:06.660]  Like CBD, this is cytotoxic for a variety of cancer cells.
[24:07.660 --> 24:12.260]  In 2005, a CBG-only plant was developed.
[24:12.260 --> 24:15.260]  It just doesn't have the enzymatic equipment
[24:15.260 --> 24:17.940]  to go beyond CBGA.
[24:18.980 --> 24:21.900]  This has been effective in various cancer cell lines
[24:21.900 --> 24:23.300]  and breast cancer.
[24:24.540 --> 24:27.780]  It showed antidepressant effects in animals,
[24:27.780 --> 24:29.500]  lowers blood pressure.
[24:29.500 --> 24:34.500]  It may reduce the production of keratinocytes in psoriasis.
[24:35.340 --> 24:39.660]  It has only a weak partial agonist activity
[24:39.660 --> 24:43.140]  at the cannabinoid receptors, a 10th of that of THC.
[24:43.140 --> 24:44.900]  And even in high doses,
[24:44.900 --> 24:49.220]  doesn't seem to be intoxicating the way THC is.
[24:49.220 --> 24:51.300]  Fascinating study from 2008
[24:51.300 --> 24:55.620]  showed powerful antibiotic activity against gram-positives,
[24:55.620 --> 24:59.500]  especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
[25:04.540 --> 25:07.140]  It also stimulates several TRP channels,
[25:07.140 --> 25:08.820]  especially TRP-M8,
[25:08.820 --> 25:12.580]  which suggests benefit in bladder cancer.
[25:14.060 --> 25:17.900]  And like CBD, it also inhibits anandamide uptake
[25:17.900 --> 25:20.380]  and may increase the gain of the system.
[25:21.940 --> 25:26.940]  It also affects P-part gamma, a nuclear receptor,
[25:28.300 --> 25:31.420]  and downregulated tumor necrosis factor alpha.
[25:32.420 --> 25:35.620]  And there was a recent study that showed
[25:37.100 --> 25:40.380]  that it worked on gluoblastoma multiforme,
[25:40.380 --> 25:43.140]  the worst form of brain tumor.
[25:45.780 --> 25:48.660]  Interestingly, this molecule,
[25:48.660 --> 25:51.940]  both cannabigerolic acid and cannabigerol,
[25:51.940 --> 25:55.060]  have been found in a South African daisy
[25:55.060 --> 25:57.300]  called Helichrysum umbraculigerum,
[25:57.300 --> 25:59.140]  but only in trace amounts.
[26:02.260 --> 26:06.420]  Last year, our group studied cannabigerol,
[26:06.420 --> 26:08.860]  the first human subject study.
[26:11.980 --> 26:16.020]  We put this through an institutional review board,
[26:16.020 --> 26:21.020]  worked online, and required that people be adults
[26:21.940 --> 26:25.780]  and that they had used a CBG predominant product,
[26:25.780 --> 26:29.340]  at least 50% CBG in the past six months.
[26:30.340 --> 26:34.620]  And this just shows the demographics.
[26:34.620 --> 26:37.900]  We had 127 completers of the survey,
[26:39.340 --> 26:41.140]  predominantly female.
[26:41.140 --> 26:44.580]  Women are better at following directions on surveys.
[26:45.860 --> 26:50.500]  And unlike most studies of patient groups using cannabis,
[26:50.500 --> 26:52.980]  the majority were working.
[26:52.980 --> 26:56.260]  So most of these people were high-functioning.
[26:57.100 --> 27:01.020]  The average duration of use was nine months.
[27:01.020 --> 27:04.900]  And people had an average of about 3 1⁄2 grams
[27:04.900 --> 27:09.900]  of CBG flour a week, or a gram of concentrate a week.
[27:10.420 --> 27:15.100]  That's lower than what we usually attribute
[27:15.100 --> 27:18.420]  to THC predominant chemoverse.
[27:20.540 --> 27:24.740]  A variety of conditions that you see lifted on the left
[27:24.740 --> 27:28.460]  were treated by these patients with cannabigerol.
[27:29.380 --> 27:31.820]  Over half used it medically,
[27:31.820 --> 27:33.660]  with only a small percentage,
[27:33.660 --> 27:36.300]  did they feel it was recreational,
[27:36.300 --> 27:41.300]  and it was a mix for 36.2%.
[27:41.940 --> 27:45.340]  The most common conditions cited were anxiety,
[27:45.340 --> 27:48.060]  chronic pain, depression, and insomnia,
[27:48.060 --> 27:51.700]  which are quite similar to the demographics
[27:51.700 --> 27:53.940]  that we see for other forms of cannabis
[27:53.940 --> 27:55.420]  used therapeutically.
[27:57.740 --> 28:01.700]  In terms of the efficacy of the CBG treatment,
[28:01.700 --> 28:03.940]  the majority of conditions reportedly
[28:03.940 --> 28:05.940]  were much or very much improved.
[28:07.300 --> 28:09.860]  Although the numbers were small on each,
[28:09.860 --> 28:13.700]  two-thirds of the people who used it for endometriosis
[28:13.700 --> 28:15.700]  found it beneficial,
[28:15.700 --> 28:19.420]  and three-quarters of those with inflammatory bowel disease,
[28:20.260 --> 28:23.820]  and for a greater number for irritable bowel syndrome.
[28:25.220 --> 28:28.380]  Interestingly, in no instance did people think
[28:28.380 --> 28:31.740]  the conventional medicine that they had taken previously
[28:31.740 --> 28:36.140]  was superior to CBG for any of the conditions.
[28:39.700 --> 28:42.900]  We're always concerned about whether the withdrawal effects,
[28:45.380 --> 28:47.940]  but a number of people actually were able
[28:47.940 --> 28:52.940]  to discontinue antidepressants, non-opioid painkillers,
[28:53.460 --> 28:57.500]  and protein pump inhibitors after taking CBG.
[28:59.100 --> 29:03.540]  In terms of side effects, 44% reported none.
[29:05.460 --> 29:07.100]  When there were side effects,
[29:07.100 --> 29:09.380]  the most common were dry mouth, sleepiness,
[29:09.380 --> 29:11.220]  increased appetite, dry eyes,
[29:11.220 --> 29:14.340]  which all really are likely related
[29:14.340 --> 29:17.660]  to some amount of THC in those preparations,
[29:18.380 --> 29:22.260]  because with CBG preparations, we don't see these complaints.
[29:23.580 --> 29:26.260]  10% reported side benefits.
[29:27.780 --> 29:30.860]  On terms of withdrawal from the medicine itself,
[29:33.540 --> 29:37.020]  84.3% reported no withdrawal symptoms,
[29:38.020 --> 29:41.300]  and compared to non-CBG cannabis,
[29:41.300 --> 29:43.900]  the more typical THC-type cannabis,
[29:44.820 --> 29:46.900]  there were many fewer issues.
[29:50.320 --> 29:53.000]  So conclusions of the survey study.
[29:53.880 --> 29:56.760]  We know that usage of this is increasing,
[29:56.760 --> 30:00.440]  particularly in the Pacific Northwest where I live.
[30:00.440 --> 30:01.920]  This was the first study
[30:01.920 --> 30:04.960]  of potential therapeutic effects in humans.
[30:04.960 --> 30:07.240]  Anxiety, pain, depression, and insomnia
[30:07.240 --> 30:10.920]  were the most commonly reported target symptoms.
[30:10.920 --> 30:13.080]  The perceived efficacy was quite high
[30:13.080 --> 30:15.200]  with few adverse events.
[30:16.200 --> 30:18.320]  The efficacy that was reported
[30:18.320 --> 30:20.520]  in inflammatory bowel diseases
[30:20.520 --> 30:24.800]  also goes along with reports of CBG
[30:24.800 --> 30:27.360]  being beneficial in animal models.
[30:29.320 --> 30:32.120]  We believe that the survey supports the idea
[30:32.120 --> 30:33.760]  that CBG would be safe
[30:33.760 --> 30:36.520]  for future randomized controlled trials.
[30:38.600 --> 30:42.160]  How does CBG compare to CBD?
[30:43.160 --> 30:47.240]  Well, both can treat pain, anxiety, and need sleep.
[30:47.240 --> 30:50.040]  Both affect the TRP channels,
[30:50.040 --> 30:54.200]  have antibiotic properties, and are cytotoxic for cancers,
[30:54.200 --> 30:57.440]  and may increase endocannabinoid tone.
[30:57.440 --> 31:02.200]  However, cannabijerol is a lot more potent than CBD.
[31:02.200 --> 31:04.400]  Basically, that means fewer milligrams
[31:04.400 --> 31:06.800]  are necessary to be effective.
[31:06.800 --> 31:11.600]  For example, anti-anxiety effects
[31:11.960 --> 31:16.360]  of CBD may require 100 to 400 milligrams,
[31:16.360 --> 31:21.360]  whereas 10 to 20 milligrams of CBG seem to be effective.
[31:22.680 --> 31:24.880]  Again, CBG-only chemoviruses
[31:24.880 --> 31:28.120]  are available in some jurisdictions,
[31:28.120 --> 31:32.360]  whereas it's very hard to eliminate THC completely
[31:32.360 --> 31:34.960]  from type 3 CBD chemovirus.
[31:35.840 --> 31:40.840]  Compared to THC, cannabijerol likely would be a useful adjunct
[31:40.840 --> 31:42.760]  to many THC chemovirus
[31:42.760 --> 31:47.440]  by providing synergistic benefits on pain, sleep, and mood.
[31:47.440 --> 31:51.560]  Because CBG has a strong anti-anxiety effect,
[31:51.560 --> 31:54.440]  it may increase the therapeutic index of THC,
[31:54.440 --> 31:56.760]  giving you more leeway at dosing.
[31:58.080 --> 32:00.280]  And what do we expect from this?
[32:00.280 --> 32:03.040]  Well, one of the things that we're seeing
[32:03.520 --> 32:06.960]  is a safe, non-sedating, non-addictive agent
[32:06.960 --> 32:08.000]  to treat anxiety,
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.600]  and CBG may be the best candidate I've ever seen.
[32:12.760 --> 32:15.880]  It seems to be quite safe and versatile,
[32:15.880 --> 32:19.560]  so its addition to various cannabis-based preparations
[32:19.560 --> 32:20.600]  makes sense.
[32:21.880 --> 32:26.000]  Could be an impressive agent for primary cancer treatment,
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.800]  again, because it kills cancer cells,
[32:28.800 --> 32:31.120]  but it doesn't kill cancer cells.
[32:31.160 --> 32:34.760]  It kills cancer cells, but it doesn't kill normal cells,
[32:34.760 --> 32:37.680]  and it's not intoxicating like THC.
[32:38.880 --> 32:41.440]  And this could be an antibiotic of the future,
[32:41.440 --> 32:43.280]  especially for MRSA,
[32:43.280 --> 32:45.760]  and another resistant bug,
[32:45.760 --> 32:49.440]  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, VRE.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.640]  Another agent in cannabis,
[32:53.640 --> 32:56.480]  hard to come by, is cannabichromine.
[32:56.480 --> 32:58.880]  This is produced by a recessive gene.
[32:58.880 --> 33:01.120]  Usually, there are only trace amounts, if any,
[33:01.120 --> 33:03.360]  in most types of cannabis.
[33:03.360 --> 33:07.560]  It's also antibiotic and antifungal, cytotoxic,
[33:08.960 --> 33:12.560]  extract-produced antidepressant effects in rodents,
[33:12.560 --> 33:15.240]  again, working on various TRP channels
[33:15.240 --> 33:18.840]  and inhibiting the breakdown of anandamide.
[33:20.040 --> 33:24.160]  But again, selective breeding may make this more available.
[33:24.160 --> 33:26.560]  Now, turning to the cannabinoid acids,
[33:26.560 --> 33:30.480]  cannabidiolic acid is what the plant makes before CBB.
[33:31.680 --> 33:35.120]  So this is the predominant phytocannabinoid in fresh hemp.
[33:35.120 --> 33:37.040]  It is a natural herbicide.
[33:38.080 --> 33:40.320]  This one can produce coxinibition,
[33:40.320 --> 33:43.880]  but only at extreme doses, which should never be necessary.
[33:45.040 --> 33:50.040]  It's a powerful agent as an antiemetic, preventing vomiting.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.680]  This is mediated through the serotonin receptor,
[33:53.720 --> 33:57.040]  and it's about between 100 and 1,000 times
[33:57.040 --> 33:59.920]  more effective than CBD itself.
[34:00.920 --> 34:04.200]  Based on historical data of how hemp was used
[34:04.200 --> 34:06.560]  by the Renaissance herbalists,
[34:06.560 --> 34:08.880]  it may be useful in treating tumors.
[34:12.340 --> 34:14.380]  I think we skipped something here.
[34:14.380 --> 34:15.980]  Okay, no, that's fine.
[34:18.060 --> 34:20.020]  In relation to the entourage effect,
[34:20.020 --> 34:22.100]  we mentioned this before
[34:22.100 --> 34:25.420]  with the entourage of endocannabinoids,
[34:26.180 --> 34:29.660]  but the same may apply to phytocannabinoids.
[34:30.740 --> 34:32.380]  Quote from 1999,
[34:32.380 --> 34:34.380]  this type of synergism may play a role
[34:34.380 --> 34:38.380]  in the widely held but not experimentally based view
[34:38.380 --> 34:40.500]  that in some cases, plants are better drugs
[34:40.500 --> 34:43.420]  than the natural products isolated from them.
[34:43.420 --> 34:45.340]  Well, that was 1999.
[34:45.340 --> 34:47.780]  Actually, we have a lot of ammunition
[34:47.780 --> 34:50.540]  to support the idea of synergy
[34:50.540 --> 34:54.140]  of the entourage effect in cannabis.
[34:54.180 --> 34:55.700]  And we see this clinically
[34:55.700 --> 35:00.260]  in combinations of full spectrum products.
[35:00.260 --> 35:04.060]  But again, cannabis doesn't just make cannabinoids,
[35:04.060 --> 35:05.780]  it also makes the terpenoids,
[35:05.780 --> 35:08.860]  which may be painkillers, anti-inflammatory,
[35:08.860 --> 35:10.740]  have mood modulating effects
[35:10.740 --> 35:13.860]  and reduce the side effects of THC.
[35:15.060 --> 35:19.500]  We see here some of the main terpenoids found in cannabis,
[35:19.500 --> 35:23.700]  also other plants that are common
[35:24.300 --> 35:25.740]  and also the same ones.
[35:25.740 --> 35:29.020]  Going through these very quickly,
[35:29.020 --> 35:33.500]  the most prevalent terpene in cannabis is beta-mercine,
[35:33.500 --> 35:35.220]  also found in celery leaf.
[35:36.180 --> 35:39.180]  I call this the primary couch lock factor in cannabis
[35:39.180 --> 35:44.020]  because it is extremely sedating when combined with THC.
[35:45.020 --> 35:49.340]  And the sedation is a narcotic-like effect.
[35:49.340 --> 35:51.140]  It is a painkiller,
[35:51.140 --> 35:53.660]  but it can be antagonized by naloxone,
[35:53.660 --> 35:58.660]  the thing that they give as an antidote to opioid overdoses.
[35:58.740 --> 36:01.460]  So it's working through a different mechanism.
[36:02.820 --> 36:04.700]  There tends to be a great deal of this
[36:04.700 --> 36:06.100]  in most kinds of cannabis,
[36:06.100 --> 36:08.700]  and we usually want to see less
[36:08.700 --> 36:12.060]  so that the results are less sedating
[36:12.060 --> 36:14.580]  for the chronic pain patient.
[36:14.580 --> 36:18.580]  Interesting, but less seen in cannabis these days
[36:18.580 --> 36:20.420]  is alpha-pinene.
[36:20.420 --> 36:23.660]  This is the most common terpene in nature
[36:23.660 --> 36:26.180]  from pine needles and other conifers.
[36:27.260 --> 36:31.060]  It's bioavailable via inhalation.
[36:31.060 --> 36:34.220]  It is a bronchodilator like THC.
[36:34.220 --> 36:37.180]  It has wide spectrum antibiotic activity.
[36:38.900 --> 36:40.700]  Its greatest effect though
[36:40.700 --> 36:43.700]  is as an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor.
[36:43.700 --> 36:46.260]  Acetylcholine is the memory molecule,
[36:46.260 --> 36:48.580]  neurotransmitter in the brain.
[36:48.580 --> 36:53.220]  And because alpha-pinene reduces its breakdown,
[36:54.260 --> 36:56.740]  its presence in cannabis may reduce
[36:56.740 --> 37:00.860]  or eliminate short-term memory impairment by THC.
[37:00.860 --> 37:04.380]  It also may have a neuroprotective effect as we see here.
[37:05.380 --> 37:07.140]  All this is supported by the fact
[37:07.140 --> 37:10.820]  that walking in a pine forest,
[37:10.820 --> 37:14.620]  or what the Japanese call shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing,
[37:14.620 --> 37:16.660]  is very good for clearing the head.
[37:17.660 --> 37:21.140]  Another agent we'd like to see more of in cannabis
[37:21.140 --> 37:23.260]  is D-limonene.
[37:23.260 --> 37:25.460]  The scent is gonna be familiar to anyone
[37:25.460 --> 37:28.220]  who's been near citrus,
[37:28.220 --> 37:31.380]  whether it be lemons, limes, oranges, et cetera.
[37:32.580 --> 37:35.460]  In humans, this has had a potent antidepressant
[37:35.460 --> 37:37.900]  and immune-stimulating effect
[37:37.900 --> 37:42.460]  that was shown in hospitalized depressed patients in Japan,
[37:42.460 --> 37:44.540]  lowering Hamilton depression scores
[37:44.540 --> 37:48.740]  and allowing discontinuation of standard antidepressants.
[37:50.380 --> 37:54.020]  This also may be useful as a dietary aid.
[37:54.020 --> 37:56.740]  It increases mitochondrial biogenesis
[37:57.820 --> 37:59.420]  and may turn white fat,
[37:59.420 --> 38:02.140]  the storage fat of obesity, into brown fat,
[38:02.140 --> 38:04.820]  which is more metabolically active.
[38:06.780 --> 38:11.580]  Linolool is a terpenoid common to lavender,
[38:11.580 --> 38:13.820]  well-known as an anti-anxiety agent.
[38:14.100 --> 38:15.740]  This, again, has been shown in humans,
[38:15.740 --> 38:19.540]  particularly demented patients with Alzheimer's disease
[38:19.540 --> 38:22.260]  that get ornery at night.
[38:22.260 --> 38:25.220]  Also prominent local anesthetic effects
[38:25.220 --> 38:26.900]  and anticonvulsant effects.
[38:26.900 --> 38:30.140]  And again, this has been demonstrated clinically.
[38:32.740 --> 38:35.260]  Karyophylline is a very interesting compound.
[38:35.260 --> 38:39.060]  It's a sesquiterpenoid, 15 carbons.
[38:39.900 --> 38:43.780]  It has strong anti-inflammatory properties
[38:43.780 --> 38:45.620]  comparable to phenylbutazone
[38:45.620 --> 38:49.660]  that's used as a non-steroidal in horses, but not people.
[38:49.660 --> 38:51.980]  But unlike the non-steroidal drugs,
[38:51.980 --> 38:56.980]  it protects the stomach from ulcers.
[38:57.260 --> 39:00.020]  This actually is also a cannabinoid.
[39:00.020 --> 39:02.980]  It's a selective CB2 agonist.
[39:02.980 --> 39:06.380]  So it's not intoxicating like THC,
[39:06.380 --> 39:10.780]  but can produce those anti-inflammatory benefits
[39:10.780 --> 39:15.420]  without producing psychoactive effects.
[39:16.700 --> 39:19.620]  And this is what's called a phytofax,
[39:19.620 --> 39:24.180]  demonstration of cannabinoids and terpenoids
[39:24.180 --> 39:27.100]  in this particular chemovar.
[39:27.100 --> 39:29.900]  The most prevalent cannabinoids,
[39:29.900 --> 39:33.820]  this is CBD and CBG,
[39:34.660 --> 39:38.700]  very lower, much lower amounts of THCA.
[39:39.860 --> 39:43.860]  What patients report in terms of the aroma and flavor
[39:43.860 --> 39:47.660]  if inhaled and the effects that they report.
[39:47.660 --> 39:50.380]  This one's high in comfort and calm.
[39:50.380 --> 39:55.380]  And we see the predominant terpenoids here
[39:55.420 --> 40:00.220]  is limonene and karyophylline with very low mercine.
[40:00.220 --> 40:05.220]  So this is a type three because it's predominantly CBD.
[40:06.900 --> 40:09.060]  This should be a non-sedating agent,
[40:10.300 --> 40:13.100]  very low in THC and mercine,
[40:13.100 --> 40:16.300]  but high in karyophylline, limonene, and cumulene.
[40:17.260 --> 40:20.780]  Patients report comfort and likely this would be helpful
[40:20.780 --> 40:23.380]  in treating pain, inflammation,
[40:23.380 --> 40:25.580]  and both CBD and karyophylline
[40:25.580 --> 40:28.100]  can be helpful in treating addiction.
[40:28.100 --> 40:31.260]  Also may be good for anxiety and depression.
[40:31.260 --> 40:34.020]  So this is how we analyze what's in cannabis
[40:34.020 --> 40:39.020]  to see what it might be good for in terms of treatment.
[40:39.940 --> 40:44.940]  And I would refer you to ethanruso.org.
[40:45.180 --> 40:49.620]  There is a library of all my publications in PDF form,
[40:49.620 --> 40:51.660]  which you can download there
[40:51.660 --> 40:54.460]  because it's my personal website.
[40:54.460 --> 40:57.020]  You shouldn't be breaking any copyright laws
[40:57.060 --> 40:58.420]  as far as my understanding.
[40:59.300 --> 41:01.500]  And I'll thank you for your attention
[41:01.500 --> 41:04.420]  and hope that I've left plenty of time for questions.
[41:07.290 --> 41:11.090]  So thank you so much, Dr. Russo.
[41:11.090 --> 41:16.090]  That was a absolutely gripping and fascinating talk.
[41:16.170 --> 41:20.250]  I think I can speak for everyone that we fully enjoyed it.
[41:20.250 --> 41:24.970]  I also wanna just give a quick thanks to our interpreters.
[41:24.970 --> 41:26.330]  That was probably tough.
[41:27.170 --> 41:31.450]  And then as well as Tony, George,
[41:31.450 --> 41:34.290]  Gemma and Kim as well for making this happen.
[41:34.290 --> 41:38.850]  So we're so proud at the USDA Plant Genetics Resources Unit
[41:38.850 --> 41:43.130]  to host this kind of knowledge and information sharing.
[41:43.130 --> 41:45.450]  And again, we just wanna thank you, Dr. Russo.
[41:45.450 --> 41:50.450]  So I believe Tony and George have some questions
[41:50.490 --> 41:51.330]  from the Q&A.
[41:52.690 --> 41:54.250]  It looks like there's a lot.
[41:54.250 --> 41:55.410]  Yep, we got a lot of questions.
[41:55.410 --> 41:58.570]  So we'll try to get through as many as possible.
[41:58.570 --> 42:02.410]  First question, are there phenotypes of cannabis
[42:02.410 --> 42:05.570]  described by Small published in 1975
[42:05.570 --> 42:08.330]  still relevant for modern varieties?
[42:08.330 --> 42:10.090]  Is there any research planned
[42:10.090 --> 42:12.450]  or currently working on reevaluating
[42:12.450 --> 42:15.490]  the 0.3% threshold on THC?
[42:16.690 --> 42:20.570]  The 0.3% threshold is a political act
[42:20.570 --> 42:23.410]  and has nothing to do with science.
[42:23.410 --> 42:28.050]  What I would mean, team, to you is the concentration
[42:28.050 --> 42:31.010]  is much less important than the total dose.
[42:31.010 --> 42:35.450]  So let's say that we had material that was 0.25% THC.
[42:41.490 --> 42:43.690]  Well, if you take too much of it,
[42:43.690 --> 42:45.930]  you could become intoxicated.
[42:45.930 --> 42:49.530]  By the same token, you could have 5% THC material,
[42:49.530 --> 42:52.210]  but if only a small amount is taken,
[42:52.210 --> 42:55.170]  it would not necessarily be intoxicating.
[42:55.170 --> 43:00.170]  So to be fair, this was an effort to allow commerce
[43:00.810 --> 43:04.210]  and material that the government hoped
[43:04.210 --> 43:07.210]  would not create other problems.
[43:07.210 --> 43:11.410]  But what's happened is people have taken
[43:11.410 --> 43:15.770]  the abundant biomass of CBD predominant material
[43:15.770 --> 43:20.770]  and transmogrified it into Delta-8 THC and other items,
[43:20.970 --> 43:23.610]  which clearly are intoxicating.
[43:23.610 --> 43:25.930]  So we obviously need to do better.
[43:25.930 --> 43:30.090]  And my suggestion would be that the politicians
[43:30.090 --> 43:33.690]  speak more to scientists that are experienced in this area.
[43:36.970 --> 43:37.930]  Awesome.
[43:37.930 --> 43:40.090]  Another question comes in.
[43:40.090 --> 43:44.250]  Do other plant groups produce cannabinoids at all?
[43:44.250 --> 43:47.610]  Yeah, I've got an article that's on the website,
[43:47.610 --> 43:49.370]  ethemerusa.org, called
[43:49.410 --> 43:52.730]  Beyond Cannabis, Plants in the Endocannabinoid System.
[43:53.530 --> 43:56.450]  In terms of things that might be cannabis-like,
[43:56.450 --> 43:59.050]  there is a component of kava kava,
[43:59.890 --> 44:02.130]  Piper methisticum called yanganin
[44:02.130 --> 44:05.290]  that seems to be an agonist at CB1.
[44:05.290 --> 44:10.290]  There's also the New Zealand liverwort, Radula marginata,
[44:10.410 --> 44:13.250]  that has THC-like molecules.
[44:13.250 --> 44:17.210]  But the problem there is this is a rare plant
[44:17.210 --> 44:20.250]  and it grows a millimeter or two a year.
[44:20.250 --> 44:22.770]  So the prospect that this is ever gonna be
[44:23.730 --> 44:26.690]  an agricultural crop is probably minimal.
[44:28.650 --> 44:31.530]  And there are lots of other examples.
[44:31.530 --> 44:36.530]  There are things that work on various receptors
[44:37.570 --> 44:40.930]  of the broad endocannabinoid dome.
[44:41.930 --> 44:46.930]  And even prebiotics and probiotics affect endocannabinoid,
[44:48.210 --> 44:50.010]  the endocannabinoid system.
[44:50.010 --> 44:53.930]  So yeah, that article would point
[44:53.930 --> 44:57.250]  to other plants, foods, and crops
[44:58.210 --> 45:03.210]  that could be leveraged to benefit endocannabinoid system.
[45:05.450 --> 45:06.290]  Okay, awesome.
[45:07.170 --> 45:10.210]  Question in from Ernie Siebert from Alabama, A&M,
[45:11.130 --> 45:15.890]  is the American Medical Association and the NIH
[45:15.890 --> 45:18.450]  on board with full-scale clinical trials,
[45:18.450 --> 45:21.530]  research, and prescribing cannabinoids to patients?
[45:23.650 --> 45:28.650]  I'm afraid he's asking the wrong person.
[45:29.450 --> 45:32.130]  I've been doing this for 26 years.
[45:32.130 --> 45:36.170]  I tried to do clinical trials of cannabis and migraine
[45:36.170 --> 45:40.090]  back in the 90s and really got stonewalled.
[45:40.970 --> 45:42.370]  The FDA cleared it,
[45:42.370 --> 45:46.730]  but the National Institute on Drug Abuse had then
[45:46.730 --> 45:49.650]  and pretty much still has a monopoly on the supply
[45:49.650 --> 45:52.810]  and would not provide the material
[45:52.810 --> 45:54.570]  for those clinical trials.
[45:55.650 --> 45:57.890]  Although the situation has improved,
[45:58.810 --> 46:01.330]  it's testament to the fact that it's still hard
[46:01.330 --> 46:02.610]  to do this kind of work.
[46:02.610 --> 46:05.530]  I've spent most of the last 26 years
[46:05.530 --> 46:08.090]  working for foreign companies.
[46:08.090 --> 46:10.130]  There's a reason for that.
[46:10.130 --> 46:13.010]  So yeah, there's a lot of room for improvement
[46:13.010 --> 46:16.850]  in the capability to do this kind of research,
[46:16.850 --> 46:19.330]  which should not be ceded to other countries
[46:19.330 --> 46:20.330]  around the world.
[46:22.770 --> 46:24.330]  Awesome.
[46:24.330 --> 46:28.530]  Question comes in, would you elaborate a little further
[46:28.530 --> 46:33.530]  on why cannabis is not referred to as a strain?
[46:34.530 --> 46:39.290]  I'm going with, I investigated this
[46:39.290 --> 46:44.290]  in the article by Lewis et al, in which I was co-author.
[46:44.730 --> 46:46.890]  We go into some detail on this.
[46:48.610 --> 46:53.610]  Strains is a useful term for viruses and bacteria.
[46:56.690 --> 47:01.330]  Better term for cannabis would be chemical varieties,
[47:01.330 --> 47:03.530]  chemovirus or even cultivars.
[47:04.410 --> 47:08.570]  And this also should be used instead of the terminology
[47:08.570 --> 47:11.930]  sativa and indica, which have nothing to do
[47:11.930 --> 47:15.570]  with the taxonomic descriptions of the plant
[47:15.570 --> 47:19.890]  in the 18th century by Linnaeus and Lamarck.
[47:19.890 --> 47:22.450]  So what's called indica today doesn't look at all
[47:22.450 --> 47:25.170]  like what Lamarck described.
[47:25.170 --> 47:27.730]  You know, he had precedents.
[47:28.570 --> 47:31.290]  As best we can ascertain,
[47:31.290 --> 47:36.290]  there's one very promiscuous species of cannabis.
[47:36.730 --> 47:40.690]  You can interbreed any type of cannabis with another,
[47:40.690 --> 47:43.890]  but what differentiates them is their effects.
[47:43.890 --> 47:46.490]  And this is mediated by their chemical contents.
[47:46.490 --> 47:49.210]  And that's why I prefer the term chemovir.
[47:52.970 --> 47:57.090]  Tyler Gordon asks, can CBG be manufactured in a lab
[47:57.130 --> 47:59.610]  or is it easier to extract from plants?
[48:00.890 --> 48:03.890]  Yes, it can be made biosynthetically.
[48:03.890 --> 48:08.290]  There are various groups working with yeast and E.coli
[48:08.290 --> 48:13.290]  to biosynthetically produce cannabinoids.
[48:14.730 --> 48:19.730]  However, this hasn't been scaled up to be practical yet.
[48:21.690 --> 48:22.690]  Can it be done?
[48:22.690 --> 48:26.370]  Likely, however, this is a weed.
[48:26.690 --> 48:29.210]  It's relatively easy to grow if you know how.
[48:29.210 --> 48:34.210]  And additionally, I think, I'm no Luddite.
[48:34.410 --> 48:37.410]  I think the science of the biosynthetic approaches
[48:37.410 --> 48:38.410]  is fascinating.
[48:38.410 --> 48:43.210]  However, to me, it will never equal what the plant can do.
[48:43.210 --> 48:46.170]  This is a plant that from its flowering tops
[48:46.170 --> 48:50.210]  can produce upwards of 30% cannabinoids,
[48:50.210 --> 48:55.090]  which is phenomenal for any secondary metabolite of a plant.
[48:55.090 --> 48:59.010]  I'm not sure of a parallel to equal it.
[48:59.010 --> 49:02.850]  Additionally, it doesn't produce one thing generally.
[49:02.850 --> 49:05.570]  It produces this entourage of compounds
[49:05.570 --> 49:09.050]  that are synergistic to one another
[49:09.050 --> 49:14.050]  and no bacterium or yeast is gonna do that.
[49:14.410 --> 49:15.930]  It will never happen.
[49:15.930 --> 49:19.570]  So I'm a strong proponent of the plant.
[49:19.570 --> 49:23.730]  I'd also add the genome of the cannabis plant
[49:23.730 --> 49:28.730]  is so plastic that you can make it do anything you want
[49:29.130 --> 49:34.010]  through good selective breeding with conventional methods.
[49:34.010 --> 49:37.810]  I'm not a fan of genetic modification
[49:37.810 --> 49:39.570]  and particularly for cannabis,
[49:39.570 --> 49:41.130]  this should never be necessary
[49:41.130 --> 49:44.050]  because you can make it do almost anything you want.
[49:47.370 --> 49:48.690]  Awesome.
[49:48.690 --> 49:51.010]  Another question from Dr. Sarah Eichler asks,
[49:51.010 --> 49:54.170]  is research on potential agricultural
[49:54.170 --> 49:55.970]  pest control applications
[49:55.970 --> 49:58.450]  using various cannabinoids available?
[49:59.690 --> 50:02.210]  Yeah, it's a very interesting question.
[50:02.210 --> 50:04.090]  On the Creto Science website,
[50:04.090 --> 50:06.250]  you'll see that one of our projects
[50:06.250 --> 50:11.250]  relates to development of cannabis-based treatment
[50:11.450 --> 50:12.650]  for head lice.
[50:14.770 --> 50:16.810]  Obviously through the question,
[50:16.810 --> 50:20.250]  it was understood that there are insecticidal properties
[50:20.250 --> 50:23.010]  of the acid cannabinoids in particular.
[50:23.010 --> 50:25.490]  So yes, this could be leveraged
[50:25.490 --> 50:29.730]  to produce agricultural products that would be safer
[50:30.730 --> 50:33.050]  as not just insecticides,
[50:33.050 --> 50:36.130]  but possibly as herbicides as well.
[50:36.130 --> 50:37.730]  So we're really interested in this.
[50:37.730 --> 50:42.730]  So far, this hasn't taken off in the industry,
[50:43.690 --> 50:48.610]  probably because of remaining constraints.
[50:49.610 --> 50:50.850]  With legalization,
[50:50.850 --> 50:54.730]  I think this would be an avenue of greater interest.
[50:56.210 --> 50:57.970]  We certainly are interested in it.
[50:59.890 --> 51:01.170]  Awesome.
[51:01.170 --> 51:04.650]  Someone asked, are any of the compounds full agonists
[51:04.650 --> 51:06.410]  at CB1 or CB2?
[51:07.850 --> 51:10.890]  No, fortunately, and that's a good thing.
[51:10.890 --> 51:14.450]  Even THC alone is really too strong.
[51:15.290 --> 51:17.010]  THC is a synthetic.
[51:17.210 --> 51:19.890]  It's been available as an FDA-approved drug
[51:19.890 --> 51:22.170]  called Marinol since 1985.
[51:22.170 --> 51:24.890]  However, it's had very poor uptake.
[51:24.890 --> 51:29.170]  And the reason is most people can't tolerate it.
[51:29.170 --> 51:31.570]  It tends to produce dysphoria,
[51:31.570 --> 51:34.330]  unhappiness rather than euphoria,
[51:34.330 --> 51:39.330]  and even experienced cannabis users don't tend to like it.
[51:41.410 --> 51:46.370]  We do see full agonists among the synthetic cannabinoids,
[51:46.370 --> 51:49.290]  K2, Spice, and the like,
[51:49.290 --> 51:52.370]  that are very prevalent as alternatives to cannabis.
[51:52.370 --> 51:56.090]  Again, this is a byproduct of prohibition.
[51:56.090 --> 51:57.370]  For the most part,
[51:57.370 --> 52:00.050]  those aren't identified on urine drug screens,
[52:00.050 --> 52:03.690]  and so people turn to them, but those are overtly dangerous.
[52:04.530 --> 52:08.130]  The endocannabinoid system is a very subtle system.
[52:08.130 --> 52:13.050]  It needs gentle nudges, not huge pushes pharmacologically
[52:13.210 --> 52:16.690]  as would be provided by pure THC or full agonists
[52:16.690 --> 52:18.450]  at the CB1 receptor.
[52:20.010 --> 52:25.010]  There may be a natural full agonist in the form of THCP,
[52:26.010 --> 52:29.610]  tetrahydrocannabiferal, which is like THC,
[52:29.610 --> 52:31.850]  but with a seven-carbon side chain.
[52:32.930 --> 52:36.970]  However, this has only been found so far trace amounts,
[52:36.970 --> 52:38.610]  and that's just as well
[52:38.610 --> 52:43.410]  because it's 23 times more potent than THC itself.
[52:46.370 --> 52:47.770]  Awesome.
[52:47.770 --> 52:51.770]  One question I think is directed towards your CBG study,
[52:51.770 --> 52:55.490]  and they're asking what were the doses used
[52:55.490 --> 52:57.250]  with the many promising results,
[52:57.250 --> 52:59.850]  and at those doses,
[52:59.850 --> 53:02.170]  what were the negative side effects found,
[53:02.170 --> 53:05.210]  and how complete are the risk assessments?
[53:05.210 --> 53:08.130]  Yeah, the exact dosing, again,
[53:08.130 --> 53:11.050]  would depend on how often the person used it a day,
[53:11.050 --> 53:13.970]  so we couldn't stratify the data that way.
[53:13.970 --> 53:18.970]  However, we know from speaking to people and observations
[53:19.290 --> 53:23.570]  that 10 to 20 milligrams at a time
[53:23.570 --> 53:27.410]  seems to be quite effective for most people for most things,
[53:27.410 --> 53:30.170]  particularly in treating anxiety.
[53:30.170 --> 53:34.170]  I know of people inhaling 40 milligrams
[53:34.170 --> 53:39.170]  of pure CBG at once with no adverse events,
[53:39.810 --> 53:41.890]  so I don't know what the upper limit is.
[53:41.890 --> 53:46.890]  It probably is very high because it's just not intoxicating,
[53:47.770 --> 53:51.250]  and there's no withdrawal effect,
[53:51.250 --> 53:54.850]  so less is more.
[53:54.850 --> 53:59.210]  If a person is getting the desired effect at a lower dose,
[53:59.210 --> 54:00.410]  that's what we recommend.
[54:00.410 --> 54:03.130]  There's no point in wasting material
[54:03.130 --> 54:05.930]  even if it doesn't have obvious side effects.
[54:10.410 --> 54:11.490]  Another question asks,
[54:11.490 --> 54:14.930]  do you know of any early production of sensimilia cannabis
[54:14.930 --> 54:16.890]  prior to the 1970s?
[54:16.890 --> 54:18.970]  It would seem that it would have happened earlier
[54:18.970 --> 54:20.490]  given human plant understanding.
[54:20.490 --> 54:23.010]  Yeah, there's a place called India
[54:23.010 --> 54:25.650]  where ganja has been grown for thousands of years,
[54:25.650 --> 54:29.130]  so this is a technique that was known to the ancients.
[54:32.060 --> 54:32.900]  Awesome.
[54:33.900 --> 54:35.580]  Someone asks, Dr. Russo,
[54:35.580 --> 54:38.260]  would you say that the misconception of sedation
[54:38.260 --> 54:41.820]  can be related to the actual receptor behaviors
[54:41.820 --> 54:44.780]  while connecting and interworking within the anatomy?
[54:46.020 --> 54:48.620]  I think this is in relation to CBD.
[54:48.620 --> 54:52.580]  Yeah, in this instance, again, at extreme doses,
[54:52.580 --> 54:55.060]  like 1,500 milligrams a day,
[54:55.060 --> 54:57.820]  CBD has been observed to produce sedation,
[54:57.820 --> 55:02.020]  but this is in the context of patients on polypharmacy.
[55:02.020 --> 55:05.780]  Generally, these are patients with severe epilepsy
[55:05.780 --> 55:08.700]  that are on scads of drugs at once,
[55:08.700 --> 55:11.860]  and so there are drug-drug interactions,
[55:11.860 --> 55:14.780]  additive sedation, et cetera,
[55:14.780 --> 55:19.780]  but at low and moderate doses, CBD is stimulating.
[55:20.500 --> 55:23.620]  I have friends in California that use a dose of CBD
[55:23.620 --> 55:28.620]  in the morning instead of caffeine these days, so yeah.
[55:28.620 --> 55:31.620]  And that's been tested by electroencephalography
[55:32.220 --> 55:33.660]  and sleep studies, et cetera.
[55:35.780 --> 55:37.620]  Great, another question comes from Phoenix,
[55:37.620 --> 55:40.220]  saying, thank you for your contributions to cannabis.
[55:40.220 --> 55:43.900]  What is the status of the current research on CHS,
[55:43.900 --> 55:47.380]  which I believe he means cannabinoid hyperremus syndrome?
[55:47.380 --> 55:49.140]  Am I saying that right?
[55:49.140 --> 55:51.660]  Yeah, there are two articles on our website,
[55:51.660 --> 55:56.340]  on the ethanrusso.org, the library,
[55:56.340 --> 55:58.820]  and it'll be on the first page.
[55:58.820 --> 56:03.660]  We did a survey that's the largest database to date
[56:03.660 --> 56:06.100]  on cannabinoid hyperremus syndrome.
[56:06.100 --> 56:08.020]  For those not familiar,
[56:08.020 --> 56:09.980]  there is a small subset of people
[56:09.980 --> 56:13.460]  who use cannabis chronically in high amounts
[56:13.460 --> 56:18.460]  that develop a syndrome of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
[56:18.900 --> 56:22.780]  and with a strange behavior of hot water bathing,
[56:22.780 --> 56:25.820]  sometimes hours a day, to allay symptoms.
[56:26.660 --> 56:29.420]  This affects certain people and not others.
[56:29.420 --> 56:32.860]  We hypothesized that there was a genetic cause,
[56:32.860 --> 56:34.460]  and that turned out to be true.
[56:34.460 --> 56:39.460]  We identified five statistically significant mutations
[56:40.820 --> 56:44.700]  in CHS patients as compared to control patients
[56:44.700 --> 56:46.500]  who use cannabis at high rates,
[56:46.500 --> 56:48.820]  but did not have the symptoms.
[56:48.820 --> 56:50.620]  And so that's available.
[56:50.620 --> 56:54.260]  There's also a commercial test that's available,
[56:54.940 --> 56:59.940]  that's accessible at what-is-chs.com.
[57:02.380 --> 57:07.380]  And again, the paper is there for you to download.
[57:11.450 --> 57:12.570]  Awesome.
[57:12.570 --> 57:15.210]  Somebody's asking, does CBD work better
[57:15.210 --> 57:17.810]  with a small amount of THC included?
[57:17.810 --> 57:19.610]  Absolutely.
[57:19.610 --> 57:23.370]  Now, I'm fond of saying that there's nothing that CBD does
[57:23.410 --> 57:27.010]  that can't be enhanced by a tiny amount of THC.
[57:27.010 --> 57:31.290]  I mean, this is the way it comes in nature invariably.
[57:31.290 --> 57:36.290]  Epidiolex probably is 97% pure
[57:37.570 --> 57:41.930]  because the FDA was THC-phobic.
[57:41.930 --> 57:46.890]  They didn't like the idea of giving THC to kids,
[57:46.890 --> 57:51.810]  even though the benefits would far outweigh the risks.
[57:51.810 --> 57:56.010]  These children with Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome
[57:56.010 --> 57:59.690]  are severely cognitively impaired in general
[57:59.690 --> 58:03.970]  and have sometimes hundreds of seizures a day.
[58:03.970 --> 58:08.970]  So any negative effect of THC really pales in comparison
[58:09.810 --> 58:13.370]  to the benefits it might have therapeutically.
[58:15.610 --> 58:16.530]  Awesome.
[58:16.530 --> 58:18.010]  There's another question related
[58:18.010 --> 58:20.770]  to the cannabinoids and insecticides.
[58:20.850 --> 58:22.370]  This is basically asking,
[58:23.490 --> 58:25.970]  are there any terpenes like alpha-pinene
[58:25.970 --> 58:28.930]  or limonene used as insecticides?
[58:28.930 --> 58:30.610]  Yeah, absolutely.
[58:30.610 --> 58:34.130]  So yeah, I mean, basically the cannabis flower
[58:35.090 --> 58:38.930]  is really designed to keep the insects at bay.
[58:38.930 --> 58:43.010]  So their insecticidal properties from the cannabinoids,
[58:43.010 --> 58:48.010]  the terpenoids, and also if an insect touches the trichome,
[58:48.770 --> 58:52.370]  it'll tend to burst and then polymerize.
[58:52.370 --> 58:55.690]  And so there's a mechanical insect trap.
[58:55.690 --> 58:58.130]  So it's a really elegant system
[58:58.130 --> 59:00.130]  to try and control predation.
[59:03.700 --> 59:05.340]  Awesome.
[59:05.340 --> 59:08.180]  I think we have time for maybe one last question.
[59:08.180 --> 59:10.980]  So have fungi or mycotoxins been looked at
[59:10.980 --> 59:15.420]  as a trigger or factor for hyperremesis conditions?
[59:15.420 --> 59:16.820]  Yeah, that ain't it.
[59:17.780 --> 59:19.620]  The symptoms don't match.
[59:20.260 --> 59:22.780]  Also implicated by some people
[59:22.780 --> 59:26.020]  have been pesticides and neem.
[59:26.020 --> 59:31.020]  But the toxicology of those substances doesn't match CHS.
[59:31.500 --> 59:35.700]  And we've identified the genetic cause.
[59:38.900 --> 59:40.660]  Unfortunately, people are always looking
[59:40.660 --> 59:43.220]  for other explanations and find it hard to believe
[59:43.220 --> 59:45.220]  that THC is the culprit.
[59:46.660 --> 59:48.300]  So in this instance,
[59:48.300 --> 59:50.420]  too much of what can be a good thing
[59:50.420 --> 59:53.540]  is a bad thing for certain people.
[59:55.700 --> 59:58.900]  So we've really bombarded Dr. Russo
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.940]  with a lot of great questions today.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.260]  And I just wanna thank you again so much
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.380]  for your vast knowledge and insights.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.180]  I know I've learned a lot.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.580]  I hope everyone else has as well.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.740]  So thank you once again,
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.100]  on behalf of the USDA Plant Genetics Resources Unit
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:21.420]  and Cornell University at Cornell Agritech.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.860]  So once again, thank you.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.620]  And it was a real pleasure.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.020]  Thank you, appreciate it.
[01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:39.030]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:41.870]  on the web at cornell.edu.
