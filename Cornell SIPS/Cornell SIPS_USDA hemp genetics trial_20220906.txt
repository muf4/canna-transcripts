[00:00.000 --> 00:08.260]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.260 --> 00:10.580]  All right, so my name is Zach Stancil.
[00:10.580 --> 00:18.660]  I am the USDA Agricultural Research Service Hemp Germplasm
[00:18.660 --> 00:24.340]  Curator at the Plant Genetics Resources Unit in Geneva,
[00:24.340 --> 00:26.900]  amongst some other things I'm doing as well.
[00:26.900 --> 00:30.740]  So in Geneva, the USDA has a really big presence here.
[00:30.740 --> 00:35.300]  And we maintain crop genetic resources collections.
[00:35.300 --> 00:38.580]  So for example, we have the largest apple collection
[00:38.580 --> 00:40.020]  in the world.
[00:40.020 --> 00:43.700]  You all kind of probably saw it on McCarthy.
[00:43.700 --> 00:47.580]  We also keep a collection of about 6,000 tomatoes, which
[00:47.580 --> 00:50.340]  is amongst the largest in the world,
[00:50.340 --> 00:52.820]  and honestly, many other crops.
[00:52.820 --> 00:56.980]  So in 2020, we really got started
[00:56.980 --> 01:02.500]  on this project of adding hemp to our germplasm collections.
[01:02.500 --> 01:04.820]  So why would we do this?
[01:04.820 --> 01:07.100]  Well, there's a lot of reasons.
[01:07.100 --> 01:09.940]  Maintaining crop genetic diversity, I believe,
[01:09.940 --> 01:11.940]  is an intrinsic good.
[01:11.940 --> 01:18.380]  Maintaining diverse cultivars from unique geographic regions
[01:18.380 --> 01:21.940]  long term can solve a lot of problems in the future
[01:21.940 --> 01:25.760]  that we may not even be aware of now.
[01:25.760 --> 01:28.960]  For example, with cabbage, we maintain a cabbage accession
[01:28.960 --> 01:31.400]  that was collected in the 1890s.
[01:31.400 --> 01:32.880]  And it still is available.
[01:32.880 --> 01:35.560]  And many times, these older cultivars
[01:35.560 --> 01:38.880]  are sources of R genes or resistance
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.200]  to different pathogens, pests, et cetera,
[01:42.200 --> 01:46.600]  or contain novel phenotypes.
[01:46.600 --> 01:50.120]  So what you're seeing right now is our first grow out
[01:50.120 --> 01:53.240]  of about half of our collection.
[01:53.240 --> 01:56.960]  So since I was here last year, we had zero accessions.
[01:56.960 --> 01:59.680]  Now we've got about 200.
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.920]  Our plan is to grow that to 2,000 in the next 10 years.
[02:04.920 --> 02:08.680]  So we're really just getting started.
[02:08.680 --> 02:14.480]  We are trying to not just conserve this genetic diversity
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.080]  but make it available to the entire hemp breeding
[02:18.080 --> 02:20.080]  and research community.
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.160]  So essentially, germplasm requesters
[02:24.160 --> 02:26.560]  can request a sample of the seeds
[02:26.560 --> 02:28.200]  from every one of these accessions
[02:28.200 --> 02:32.760]  and have them sent anywhere in the world.
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.760]  We are also extensively phenotyping this collection
[02:36.760 --> 02:39.800]  for a mind-boggling number of traits.
[02:39.800 --> 02:43.520]  So plant architectural traits, height, width,
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.680]  growth architecture.
[02:45.680 --> 02:49.440]  Every female plant is going to have tissue sampled and sent
[02:49.480 --> 02:53.080]  off for cannabinoid analysis, terpene, anthocyanins,
[02:53.080 --> 02:55.440]  phenolics.
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.120]  We're taking a subsample of seed for fatty acid analysis.
[03:01.800 --> 03:04.480]  We're trying to chop every single plant out
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.000]  of this field at the end of the season
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.520]  and send to our fiber collaborator, Chris Delhomme,
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.000]  at the New Orleans USDA Fiber Lab.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.360]  And he's going to be evaluating every plant
[03:17.360 --> 03:21.480]  for many different fiber characteristics.
[03:21.480 --> 03:24.240]  So we'll get all these huge data sets
[03:24.240 --> 03:26.840]  and attach them to each accession.
[03:26.840 --> 03:33.080]  So a plant breeder could say, I want a CBG dominant cultivar
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.040]  with low apical dominance that has low pectin.
[03:39.040 --> 03:40.440]  Whatever you can think of.
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.800]  You can find germplasm that fits the set of criteria
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.240]  that you're looking for.
[03:46.280 --> 03:48.400]  So that's just a little bit of what we're doing.
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.440]  I'm going to pass it off to our hemp breeder, Tyler Gordon,
[03:53.440 --> 03:53.960]  as well.
[03:53.960 --> 03:55.880]  By the way, if you want to look in the field,
[03:55.880 --> 03:58.440]  you can scan the QR code on the left.
[03:58.440 --> 04:01.200]  And that will link you to Grin Global,
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.200]  which is an online page for each one of these accessions.
[04:05.200 --> 04:07.600]  It's kind of depopulated data right now.
[04:07.600 --> 04:12.400]  But by end of season, we should have a lot more info there.
[04:13.400 --> 04:15.160]  Zach, can you hand me the other mic, too?
[04:15.160 --> 04:15.660]  Yep.
[04:26.470 --> 04:30.520]  Is that OK?
[04:30.520 --> 04:31.720]  All right.
[04:31.720 --> 04:34.400]  Thank you all for attending this afternoon.
[04:34.400 --> 04:36.560]  It looks like a terrific crowd out there.
[04:36.560 --> 04:40.760]  And we've heard some fantastic research studies
[04:40.760 --> 04:43.320]  that have been ongoing this morning.
[04:43.320 --> 04:46.960]  So really excited, like Zach, to share a little bit more
[04:46.960 --> 04:50.400]  about the USDA ARS collection.
[04:50.400 --> 04:52.640]  My name is Tyler Gordon.
[04:52.640 --> 04:55.440]  And again, I'm with USDA ARS.
[04:55.440 --> 04:59.080]  I came just recently, a few months ago,
[04:59.080 --> 05:02.280]  from the USDA ARS lab in Idaho.
[05:02.280 --> 05:04.240]  And there I worked on small grains.
[05:04.240 --> 05:06.960]  So the grain part of hemp I'm very familiar with.
[05:06.960 --> 05:10.680]  The secondary metabolite profiles and fiber,
[05:10.680 --> 05:13.080]  not too familiar with yet.
[05:13.080 --> 05:14.520]  However, as Zach mentioned, we're
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.380]  going to be doing lots of evaluations this year.
[05:18.380 --> 05:23.260]  I think we're going to take over 100 individual trait data
[05:23.260 --> 05:26.260]  points from each one of these plants here.
[05:26.260 --> 05:30.580]  And that's going to be super informative for breeders,
[05:30.580 --> 05:33.980]  regardless of what the end quality, end product is
[05:33.980 --> 05:35.980]  that you're breeding for.
[05:35.980 --> 05:41.380]  So whether that's fiber or grain, secondary metabolites,
[05:41.380 --> 05:44.260]  or maybe a combination of some of those things,
[05:44.260 --> 05:46.580]  I think that'll be really useful data.
[05:46.580 --> 05:51.340]  That'll be posted on the USDA Grain Global website.
[05:51.340 --> 05:56.380]  So anyone throughout the world has access to that information.
[05:56.380 --> 05:58.860]  Additionally, I think Zach mentioned this,
[05:58.860 --> 06:00.900]  the seeds from this collection are
[06:00.900 --> 06:05.500]  going to be available to the research community.
[06:05.500 --> 06:08.300]  The one stipulation that we have from these seeds
[06:08.300 --> 06:11.860]  is that in order for us to distribute them,
[06:11.860 --> 06:14.680]  they're going to have to be low THC.
[06:14.680 --> 06:18.240]  So if you're looking for those high THC cultivars,
[06:18.240 --> 06:20.120]  or varieties, or accessions, you're
[06:20.120 --> 06:23.880]  not going to be able to get them from us.
[06:23.880 --> 06:27.800]  One thing that I would ask of you guys,
[06:27.800 --> 06:31.800]  so we're just kind of starting this pre-breeding program here.
[06:31.800 --> 06:34.720]  I'm hoping that you have access to the QR codes.
[06:34.720 --> 06:37.480]  I want to hand around our flyer here.
[06:40.340 --> 06:43.280]  And if you would scan the QR code,
[06:43.280 --> 06:45.000]  there's a survey there.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.200]  And I would like everybody to kind of,
[06:47.200 --> 06:51.020]  if you're interested in hemp material for your breeding
[06:51.020 --> 06:54.520]  programs, if you could scan the QR code, fill out the survey.
[06:54.520 --> 06:55.240]  It's very quick.
[06:55.240 --> 06:57.740]  I think there's, what, 10 questions or something?
[06:57.740 --> 07:00.280]  And that can kind of help us determine
[07:00.280 --> 07:02.680]  what kind of breeding priorities we
[07:02.680 --> 07:04.840]  should set for this material.
[07:04.840 --> 07:09.760]  So we'll have all this terrific data from this location.
[07:09.760 --> 07:11.960]  We also have a couple other locations
[07:11.960 --> 07:14.260]  that we're going to be collaborating with on the West
[07:14.260 --> 07:16.800]  Coast, Oregon State, Washington State.
[07:16.800 --> 07:19.240]  Also hoping to develop collaborations
[07:19.240 --> 07:22.220]  with some groups in the Midwest, and also in the South,
[07:22.220 --> 07:26.300]  to see how these plants perform across geographical locations.
[07:26.300 --> 07:28.080]  I think some of the other folks today
[07:28.080 --> 07:31.720]  have talked about the importance of some genotypes
[07:31.720 --> 07:34.400]  might look terrific here in Geneva,
[07:34.400 --> 07:38.000]  but they wouldn't necessarily look fabulous, say,
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.280]  in Louisiana or Alabama.
[07:41.280 --> 07:44.240]  And then one other thing I want to talk about just a little bit
[07:44.240 --> 07:48.960]  is some of the disease and insect resistance
[07:48.960 --> 07:52.320]  that we heard about this morning.
[07:52.320 --> 07:54.800]  I think one of the really amazing things
[07:54.800 --> 07:58.760]  about these collections is how they
[07:58.760 --> 08:04.320]  can act as a reservoir for important genetic diversity,
[08:04.320 --> 08:07.880]  and also important genes that we might not even
[08:07.880 --> 08:12.880]  know we need for the crop at this point.
[08:12.880 --> 08:18.000]  And so for instance, if there's a new disease that we're not
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.960]  familiar with, and it comes in 10 years,
[08:20.960 --> 08:26.760]  that's what these germplasm collections are here for.
[08:26.760 --> 08:29.760]  You might have a really ratty looking.
[08:29.760 --> 08:31.280]  You can see some of this material
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.600]  out here, where it's a landrace, or a ditchweed, from Nebraska.
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.080]  And it looks like it has no value whatsoever.
[08:39.080 --> 08:43.040]  But you screen that against some new insect or disease,
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.200]  and you can find some really interesting resistance there.
[08:48.200 --> 08:50.200]  And so again, all this data is going
[08:50.200 --> 08:52.440]  to be made publicly available.
[08:52.440 --> 08:54.160]  The germplasm is also going to be
[08:54.160 --> 08:56.360]  available to the hemp community.
[08:56.360 --> 08:59.480]  Please fill out the survey, the online survey.
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.880]  That's really going to help us.
[09:03.880 --> 09:04.480]  Oh, yeah.
[09:04.480 --> 09:05.360]  Yeah.
[09:05.360 --> 09:07.800]  And just one other point.
[09:07.800 --> 09:12.040]  I wanted to thank our field crew, field team.
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.720]  Zach and I did not do all this work ourselves.
[09:14.720 --> 09:16.600]  And so I see some folks out here.
[09:16.600 --> 09:21.920]  Nick, Dan, Tony, I saw Peter earlier.
[09:21.920 --> 09:23.360]  And so thank you so much.
[09:23.360 --> 09:25.680]  And I also wanted to thank the organizers, Cornell,
[09:25.680 --> 09:31.280]  for letting us highlight this terrific diversity in hemp.
[09:31.280 --> 09:34.040]  And so if you have any questions, please let me know.
[09:34.040 --> 09:37.440]  Also, please feel free to walk through the material,
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.640]  as Zach said.
[09:38.640 --> 09:39.240]  Where is that?
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.760]  Oh, you have the sign again.
[09:40.760 --> 09:45.160]  At the start of each plot is one of these signs.
[09:45.160 --> 09:46.960]  There's a QR code that'll link you up
[09:46.960 --> 09:53.360]  with GRIN, which is the USDA online genetic database.
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.840]  On the front side, it gives you some more information,
[09:55.840 --> 09:56.760]  like the field number.
[09:56.760 --> 09:59.160]  The back side has the cultivar, if that's maybe
[09:59.160 --> 10:01.680]  more familiar with people.
[10:01.680 --> 10:04.240]  And so I can take questions at this point,
[10:04.240 --> 10:06.160]  or you can ask them at any point.
[10:06.160 --> 10:08.200]  The signs are on the north end of the plot.
[10:08.200 --> 10:08.960]  They're serpentine.
[10:08.960 --> 10:10.240]  Serpentine.
[10:10.240 --> 10:13.200]  So you're going to have to kind of look for them.
[10:13.200 --> 10:13.700]  Yeah.
[10:19.080 --> 10:25.920]  So let's say you're sending all these samples to be tested out.
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.160]  You're measuring 100 different variables of the phenotype.
[10:30.160 --> 10:32.480]  But the expression of the phenotype
[10:32.480 --> 10:35.720]  depends on a lot of factors, right?
[10:35.760 --> 10:39.240]  So how do you average over many seasons?
[10:39.240 --> 10:40.440]  Are there as many sites?
[10:40.440 --> 10:42.280]  Or how does that work?
[10:42.280 --> 10:43.720]  That's a really great question.
[10:43.720 --> 10:46.760]  So GRIN Global, which is, like Tyler mentioned,
[10:46.760 --> 10:50.520]  our online database, is really tooling up
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.880]  to capture these robust, high-dimensional data sets.
[10:53.880 --> 10:57.320]  So kind of the old model was you had one trait
[10:57.320 --> 11:01.120]  for that the tomatoes are yellow.
[11:01.120 --> 11:03.280]  The new GRIN model is such that we
[11:03.280 --> 11:06.440]  can attach large data sets that can capture
[11:06.440 --> 11:09.240]  multi-year, multi-environment trials
[11:09.240 --> 11:13.040]  and keep those attached to not only the accession,
[11:13.040 --> 11:16.720]  but the inventory, the seed lot within that accession.
[11:16.720 --> 11:22.000]  And then also, as these collections are genotyped,
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.560]  those markers will also be attached to the accession
[11:24.560 --> 11:27.520]  as well.
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.500]  Great question.
[11:32.500 --> 11:33.060]  Come on.
[11:33.060 --> 11:35.060]  There's got to be a few more questions in here.
[11:38.020 --> 11:38.580]  If I may?
[11:38.580 --> 11:39.300]  Yes, go for it.
[11:39.300 --> 11:43.340]  So then, similar for the genotype,
[11:43.340 --> 11:50.260]  let's say you're preserving varieties of cultivars here.
[11:50.260 --> 11:57.020]  But if the cultivar originates from a different environment,
[11:57.020 --> 11:58.100]  is there a worry?
[11:58.100 --> 12:01.380]  Or how do you deal with potentially the genotype
[12:01.420 --> 12:05.460]  drifting or adapting to the local environment here?
[12:05.460 --> 12:10.860]  Yeah, so that's the classic question in crop genetic
[12:10.860 --> 12:12.500]  resource conservation.
[12:12.500 --> 12:16.180]  So there are many different factors
[12:16.180 --> 12:18.140]  to maintain that allelic diversity,
[12:18.140 --> 12:21.340]  the heterozygosity within a population.
[12:21.340 --> 12:22.900]  First of all, we don't even really
[12:22.900 --> 12:25.660]  know how heterozygous a lot of these materials are.
[12:25.660 --> 12:28.180]  I would guess a lot.
[12:28.180 --> 12:29.660]  There's a lot.
[12:29.700 --> 12:32.180]  But that probably varies from cultivar to cultivar.
[12:32.180 --> 12:37.220]  So in a perfect world, you would maintain an infinite population
[12:37.220 --> 12:44.100]  size and store a zillion seeds from that random mating.
[12:44.100 --> 12:47.500]  We can't do that with our seed bank size and capacity.
[12:47.500 --> 12:49.380]  And it's a few of us.
[12:49.380 --> 12:52.220]  So how do you find the sweet spot of optimal population
[12:52.220 --> 12:57.500]  size, pollination control, running regions
[12:57.500 --> 12:59.060]  from older seed lots?
[12:59.060 --> 13:01.900]  There's a lot of best practices that you
[13:01.900 --> 13:06.900]  can take to maintain that genetic diversity long term.
[13:06.900 --> 13:10.140]  You didn't ask this question, but our seed lots
[13:10.140 --> 13:13.060]  are also split up and stored in multiple locations
[13:13.060 --> 13:15.700]  in the event of something catastrophic happening.
[13:15.700 --> 13:21.300]  So we have a mothership gene bank at Fort Collins, Colorado
[13:21.300 --> 13:24.380]  that we'll send aliquots of the seeds to.
[13:24.380 --> 13:26.500]  And then those seeds, in turn, will get backed up
[13:26.500 --> 13:29.100]  at this farballed seed vault in Norway
[13:29.100 --> 13:31.460]  in a, quote unquote, black box.
[13:31.460 --> 13:35.020]  So that's something that's very much on our mind.
[13:35.020 --> 13:41.220]  And as hemp has not been conserved
[13:41.220 --> 13:44.860]  in a rigorous scientific way, for the most part,
[13:44.860 --> 13:46.340]  there's a lot we're trying to learn.
[13:46.340 --> 13:49.660]  So pointing out some of the work of Nick Jenna, my postdoc
[13:49.660 --> 13:54.980]  here, so he's looking at how do you store pollen long term?
[13:54.980 --> 13:57.540]  There's just a lot of open-standing questions
[13:57.540 --> 14:00.380]  that we're trying to drill into that
[14:00.380 --> 14:05.180]  will provide a cohesive set of principles
[14:05.180 --> 14:07.340]  to maintain that genetic diversity long term.
[14:10.060 --> 14:11.900]  And I just want to add really quickly,
[14:11.900 --> 14:13.980]  you've probably heard from some of the other groups
[14:13.980 --> 14:16.740]  today about the heterogeneity levels
[14:16.740 --> 14:20.300]  within things that are even classified as cultivars.
[14:20.300 --> 14:22.980]  And so pay close attention as you move through the field
[14:22.980 --> 14:24.380]  today.
[14:24.380 --> 14:26.500]  You can see a label.
[14:26.500 --> 14:29.820]  And then there will be 10 plants behind that label.
[14:29.820 --> 14:33.580]  And you'll see they don't all look alike or even close
[14:33.580 --> 14:34.940]  to alike in some cases.
[14:34.940 --> 14:37.100]  Sometimes within one cultivar, you'll
[14:37.100 --> 14:41.020]  have some plants that are five feet tall and some
[14:41.020 --> 14:43.060]  that are less than a foot tall.
[14:43.060 --> 14:45.860]  And so that's one of the priorities
[14:45.860 --> 14:48.340]  for the breeding program is to release
[14:48.340 --> 14:50.860]  stuff that has a lot more uniformity
[14:50.860 --> 14:57.250]  within the cultivar.
[14:57.250 --> 14:57.750]  Great.
[14:57.750 --> 15:01.510]  Thanks very much, Tyler and Zach.
[15:01.510 --> 15:06.230]  We are very, very fortunate to have the hemp germplasm
[15:06.230 --> 15:08.950]  repository here at Cornell Agrotech and PGRU.
[15:08.950 --> 15:11.670]  We thank Senator Schumer for that.
[15:11.670 --> 15:16.750]  His office made the initial push for that location.
[15:16.750 --> 15:18.830]  And we really appreciate that.
[15:18.830 --> 15:20.670]  Because it's great to work with these folks.
[15:20.670 --> 15:26.430]  And we have immediate access to their knowledge and resources.
[15:26.430 --> 15:27.510]  Hey, go see our movie.
[15:27.510 --> 15:28.010]  Yeah.
[15:35.790 --> 15:39.270]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[15:39.270 --> 15:42.070]  on the web at cornell.edu.
