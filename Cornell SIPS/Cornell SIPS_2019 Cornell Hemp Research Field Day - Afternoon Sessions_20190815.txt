[00:00.000 --> 00:11.620]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:11.620 --> 00:14.260]  Tim Sweeney, who is a policy analyst
[00:14.260 --> 00:21.460]  and works 150% for Ag and Markets, 100% of that on hemp
[00:21.460 --> 00:23.220]  and 50% on his real job.
[00:27.460 --> 00:30.260]  So Tim is just going to give us a little overview
[00:30.260 --> 00:33.620]  of the current regulatory status from the Ag and Markets
[00:33.620 --> 00:34.260]  perspective.
[00:34.260 --> 00:38.660]  And then I'm sure he'd be happy to take all of your questions.
[00:38.660 --> 00:41.340]  Maybe not all of them.
[00:41.340 --> 00:42.740]  Hello, everyone.
[00:42.740 --> 00:45.340]  So I just want to start off with a little background
[00:45.340 --> 00:46.020]  on the program.
[00:46.020 --> 00:49.780]  As many of you probably know, the 2014 federal farm bill
[00:49.780 --> 00:53.220]  was the law that allowed us to begin this whole adventure
[00:53.220 --> 00:54.420]  in the first place.
[00:54.420 --> 00:57.260]  And subsequently, now the 2018 farm bill
[00:57.260 --> 01:00.380]  has expanded the program and changed it somewhat.
[01:00.380 --> 01:04.460]  Whereas hemp is no longer a controlled substance federally.
[01:04.460 --> 01:06.260]  However, until we have guidelines
[01:06.260 --> 01:09.580]  from the federal government, from the USDA in particular,
[01:09.580 --> 01:12.500]  we are continuing to operate under the 2014 program
[01:12.500 --> 01:13.020]  guidelines.
[01:13.020 --> 01:15.460]  So you need to keep that in mind,
[01:15.460 --> 01:19.020]  that it is not yet a fully free market out there.
[01:19.020 --> 01:20.780]  You still need to register with the state,
[01:20.780 --> 01:24.500]  and you will even after the 2018 program is fully enforced.
[01:24.500 --> 01:28.540]  That's part of the requirements of the federal farm bill.
[01:28.540 --> 01:32.060]  So the farm bill requires that the USDA now
[01:32.060 --> 01:34.580]  take charge of industrial hemp.
[01:34.580 --> 01:36.500]  It takes it out of the realm of the DEA
[01:36.500 --> 01:38.540]  as it's no longer a controlled substance.
[01:38.540 --> 01:40.460]  I should say as an aside, though, New York law
[01:40.460 --> 01:42.260]  has not quite caught up yet.
[01:42.260 --> 01:44.860]  So technically, hemp is still a controlled substance
[01:44.860 --> 01:45.620]  in New York state.
[01:45.620 --> 01:48.060]  But they're working on fixing that.
[01:48.060 --> 01:51.900]  So the USDA now is in the process
[01:51.900 --> 01:54.060]  of establishing their regulations
[01:54.060 --> 01:56.660]  to run the hemp program for the entire nation.
[01:56.660 --> 01:59.740]  Once their regs come out, once their program guidelines come
[01:59.740 --> 02:04.620]  out, each state that wants to host a program
[02:04.620 --> 02:06.180]  will have to apply to the USDA.
[02:06.180 --> 02:09.060]  The USDA will have to approve the state program.
[02:09.060 --> 02:13.380]  And after that, we will do rulemaking in New York state,
[02:13.380 --> 02:16.020]  which will then, for those of you who are in the program,
[02:16.020 --> 02:18.460]  you're familiar with the research partner agreements.
[02:18.460 --> 02:21.900]  We expect that the requirements to have those will go away,
[02:21.900 --> 02:24.500]  and we'll be running the program pursuant to regulations.
[02:24.540 --> 02:26.700]  But for now, all of those requirements
[02:26.700 --> 02:29.540]  for the research partner agreements remain in force,
[02:29.540 --> 02:34.340]  and the 2014 Farm Bill remains in force.
[02:34.340 --> 02:36.900]  One exception that any of you who
[02:36.900 --> 02:39.980]  wanted to get seed in the past from a foreign source
[02:39.980 --> 02:42.420]  know what you had to go through with us for that.
[02:42.420 --> 02:45.860]  We had to apply to the DEA to get an import permit.
[02:45.860 --> 02:47.900]  They would then send the paperwork back to me.
[02:47.900 --> 02:50.060]  I would send your permit to you.
[02:50.060 --> 02:52.020]  The seed would have to be delivered to our office
[02:52.020 --> 02:54.140]  in Albany, and then you'd have to come and get it.
[02:54.140 --> 02:56.780]  That has all gone away now, as the DEA is no longer
[02:56.780 --> 03:00.020]  requiring and will not issue any import permits.
[03:00.020 --> 03:02.940]  Early on this year, there was a bit of confusion
[03:02.940 --> 03:07.100]  where the DEA said, we're not issuing permits,
[03:07.100 --> 03:09.100]  and the government in Canada said,
[03:09.100 --> 03:11.460]  well, we're not sending seed to the US without a permit.
[03:11.460 --> 03:13.460]  So we were in a tough spot there.
[03:13.460 --> 03:15.460]  But we finally worked all of that out.
[03:15.460 --> 03:17.860]  There are no longer any DEA permits required,
[03:17.860 --> 03:19.380]  and you do not have to come to Albany
[03:19.380 --> 03:20.580]  to pick up your seed anymore.
[03:20.580 --> 03:22.180]  It can be delivered directly to you.
[03:22.180 --> 03:23.940]  And any of you that had the misfortune
[03:23.940 --> 03:25.820]  of having to come to our office to get the seed
[03:25.820 --> 03:30.340]  will appreciate how big a deal that is.
[03:30.340 --> 03:36.220]  So over the years since the 2014 Farm Bill started this all off,
[03:36.220 --> 03:39.660]  2016 was our first year that we had a crop in the ground
[03:39.660 --> 03:40.660]  in New York State.
[03:40.660 --> 03:43.340]  And the program has grown like crazy since then.
[03:43.340 --> 03:46.580]  I think we're up to just over 500 growers now,
[03:46.580 --> 03:49.580]  and that represents about 18,000 acres approved
[03:49.580 --> 03:52.420]  for growing in New York State.
[03:52.420 --> 03:54.260]  About 75% of that, a question was
[03:54.260 --> 03:58.380]  asked in the morning session, how much of the acreage
[03:58.380 --> 04:00.020]  is devoted to CBD.
[04:00.020 --> 04:04.580]  About 75% is CBD, would be a good guess, I think.
[04:04.580 --> 04:06.220]  We're currently taking applications
[04:06.220 --> 04:09.620]  for growing for fiber, grain, and CBD.
[04:09.620 --> 04:11.020]  We're currently taking applications
[04:11.020 --> 04:12.820]  for processing of fiber and grain.
[04:12.820 --> 04:15.900]  We are not, however, accepting any applications right now
[04:15.900 --> 04:17.500]  for processing CBD.
[04:17.500 --> 04:20.140]  And we don't know when that will open up again.
[04:20.140 --> 04:24.980]  I expect it will, but I really have no idea when that would be.
[04:24.980 --> 04:26.940]  Let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.
[04:29.580 --> 04:35.020]  OK, with regard to CBD, CBD in food, according to the FDA,
[04:35.020 --> 04:37.740]  and the FDA still has oversight over CBD,
[04:37.740 --> 04:39.420]  that was pretty clear in the federal Farm
[04:39.420 --> 04:43.020]  Bill that nothing in the Farm Bill undid FDA law.
[04:43.020 --> 04:45.540]  And so as far as the FDA is concerned,
[04:45.540 --> 04:49.780]  you cannot add CBD to food, and you cannot sell
[04:49.820 --> 04:52.620]  CBD as a dietary supplement.
[04:52.620 --> 04:55.580]  New York state, we have a different approach.
[04:55.580 --> 05:00.020]  You can add CBD to products that look like food
[05:00.020 --> 05:06.900]  if those products are made as a dietary supplement in a GMP facility
[05:06.900 --> 05:09.500]  and following all the code of federal regulation sections
[05:09.500 --> 05:11.980]  that apply to dietary supplements.
[05:11.980 --> 05:14.700]  The product would then have to be labeled as a dietary supplement,
[05:14.700 --> 05:18.180]  marketed as a dietary supplement, and sold as a dietary supplement.
[05:18.180 --> 05:22.700]  So we are a little bit different than some other states in that regard,
[05:22.700 --> 05:27.300]  but we do allow CBD in those products.
[05:27.300 --> 05:28.860]  Does anyone have any questions so far?
[05:35.140 --> 05:39.020]  I think I've pretty much covered everything
[05:39.020 --> 05:40.340]  that I needed to tell you.
[05:40.340 --> 05:42.500]  For now, the application process remains the same.
[05:42.500 --> 05:43.780]  You apply to us.
[05:43.780 --> 05:45.220]  It's still a $500 fee.
[05:45.220 --> 05:47.500]  It's a three-year application, a three-year license
[05:47.500 --> 05:48.760]  that you would be granted.
[05:48.760 --> 05:51.920]  You would go through the process of having to do the research partner
[05:51.920 --> 05:54.800]  agreement, having that notarized and returned to us.
[05:54.800 --> 06:00.120]  You would need to still be sampled 21 days prior to when you want to harvest.
[06:00.120 --> 06:01.000]  You contact us.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.160]  We will send a horticulture inspector out.
[06:03.160 --> 06:05.760]  You have to fill out what's called a harvest report form with us.
[06:05.760 --> 06:07.520]  Our horticulture inspectors will come out.
[06:07.520 --> 06:10.320]  They'll sample your crop, send the sample back to our food lab
[06:10.320 --> 06:12.760]  to do the regulatory test, and then you'd
[06:12.760 --> 06:17.720]  be good to go if your crop is within legal limits.
[06:17.720 --> 06:19.760]  Do you have any thoughts on how much late time we
[06:19.760 --> 06:22.280]  need to give you for harvest date?
[06:22.280 --> 06:23.600]  It's within 21 days.
[06:23.600 --> 06:28.040]  No, but your inspector's coming out and getting the harvest report.
[06:28.040 --> 06:28.800]  So you will apply.
[06:28.800 --> 06:31.320]  You're not going to call us today and get it in my farm.
[06:31.320 --> 06:32.280]  You apply to us.
[06:32.280 --> 06:35.360]  You send in the harvest report form, which is more like a harvest request.
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.760]  It's sort of a misnomer.
[06:36.760 --> 06:38.040]  So it's a harvest request form.
[06:38.040 --> 06:40.440]  So within 21 days of when you want to harvest
[06:40.440 --> 06:43.480]  is when you should send that form to us.
[06:43.480 --> 06:45.680]  So then we will do our best to get an inspector.
[06:45.680 --> 06:48.480]  I think they're shooting for within a week.
[06:48.480 --> 06:50.800]  Two to three days, in my experience.
[06:50.800 --> 06:54.400]  Two to three days, Larry says, has been his experience.
[06:54.400 --> 06:59.160]  What do you say to stores that are selling CBD products that
[06:59.160 --> 07:01.960]  could be shipped anywhere nationally?
[07:01.960 --> 07:05.360]  That is not within the purview of our program.
[07:05.360 --> 07:09.800]  So we have told people that if they are selling a product
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.520]  that the FDA considers illegal, they could be in a bind there.
[07:16.480 --> 07:20.120]  There is somewhat of a gray area as to what is allowed and what isn't allowed.
[07:20.120 --> 07:22.000]  But some of it's very plain.
[07:22.000 --> 07:33.190]  And the FDA, if they choose to enforce, they could take enforcement action.
[07:33.190 --> 07:37.470]  You cannot sell any raw flour in New York State to anyone outside the program.
[07:37.470 --> 07:43.230]  And you cannot make any smokable or vapable products in New York.
[07:43.230 --> 07:48.990]  What is your timeline once the FDA has established guidelines, FTC,
[07:49.070 --> 07:53.790]  or whatever it needs for cross-border transactions?
[07:53.790 --> 07:57.110]  Are you expecting to come out about the same time?
[07:57.110 --> 08:00.670]  They are obviously going to have to review, do some policy looking.
[08:00.670 --> 08:03.150]  So you're talking about when the USDA issues their program?
[08:03.150 --> 08:05.950]  When do you expect to come out with state after?
[08:05.950 --> 08:07.510]  As soon as possible is the answer.
[08:07.510 --> 08:09.150]  And I know that's not a great answer.
[08:09.150 --> 08:14.590]  We are, I spoke with the woman who runs the Ag Marketing Services section at
[08:14.590 --> 08:18.110]  the USDA and they're tasked with developing the program.
[08:18.110 --> 08:22.950]  And she said that they are on track for early fall release of the USDA program
[08:22.950 --> 08:23.790]  guidelines.
[08:23.790 --> 08:28.910]  So then we will do everything in our power to get our program submitted to them in
[08:28.910 --> 08:30.950]  a timely fashion and get it back out.
[08:30.950 --> 08:33.750]  I would certainly hope that we would be running under the new program for
[08:33.750 --> 08:34.830]  next growing season.
[08:34.830 --> 08:37.150]  But we don't know.
[08:37.150 --> 08:41.670]  There's a lot of variables and potential hang ups there.
[08:41.670 --> 08:42.170]  Okay.
[08:43.910 --> 08:45.070]  Quick question, the last question.
[08:45.070 --> 08:49.950]  You mentioned that there's CBD is not made over smokeable flour.
[08:49.950 --> 08:51.030]  Are they sold?
[08:51.030 --> 08:52.070]  Say it again.
[08:52.070 --> 08:53.790]  And the last question before that,
[08:53.790 --> 08:57.870]  you said something that smokeable CBD flour cannot be sold.
[08:57.870 --> 08:58.870]  Did I miss heard that?
[08:58.870 --> 09:00.070]  No, you heard it right.
[09:00.070 --> 09:01.150]  Not in the program.
[09:01.150 --> 09:04.950]  Okay, the question was whether or not CBD smokeable flour is allowed in New York
[09:04.950 --> 09:06.030]  State. It is not.
[09:06.030 --> 09:11.510]  We do not, in our program you cannot sell raw flour to anyone outside the program
[09:11.510 --> 09:14.630]  and it cannot do any smokeable or vapable products.
[09:15.150 --> 09:16.150]  How is it being sold in New York State?
[09:16.150 --> 09:22.870]  They're not in our program or they're violating their program agreement with us.
[09:22.870 --> 09:25.830]  And if that's the case, then they could be expelled from the program.
[09:25.830 --> 09:37.410]  If the comprehensive cannabis law is approved.
[09:37.410 --> 09:38.410]  Right.
[09:38.410 --> 09:45.800]  If that's when the fund is regulated within New York State,
[09:45.800 --> 09:50.280]  will that be developed under this office of cannabis management?
[09:50.280 --> 09:56.720]  And will that jurisdiction be shared by ag and markets and by the Department of Health
[09:56.720 --> 09:58.720]  or the Labor Board?
[09:58.720 --> 09:59.720]  Yeah.
[09:59.720 --> 10:05.280]  I don't want to speculate on legislation that hasn't passed yet
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.040]  and may actually look a lot different than the old legislation.
[10:09.040 --> 10:11.280]  I don't know what it would look like.
[10:11.280 --> 10:14.280]  But that is the model that was in the previous legislation
[10:14.280 --> 10:17.920]  was that CBD would be under that new authority.
[10:17.920 --> 10:22.920]  So that might fundamentally change extraction regulations.
[10:22.920 --> 10:25.920]  Cannabis would have a bit of a potential.
[10:25.920 --> 10:31.920]  Raise the level of allowable THC within the plant to maybe 1%
[10:31.920 --> 10:39.250]  to allow it to grow varieties that are around 20 to 22 million.
[10:39.250 --> 10:43.250]  In order for it to be industrial hemp, it has to be 0.3 or below THC.
[10:43.250 --> 10:48.250]  So I don't know what the legislation, if any, would look like.
[10:48.250 --> 10:52.250]  I don't know if they would write something in the law that would address that.
[10:52.250 --> 10:56.250]  However, I will say that the federal level is 0.3
[10:56.250 --> 11:00.250]  and we're going to be held to the federal standard to get our program approved.
[11:00.250 --> 11:04.250]  So that's the best I can give you on that.
[11:04.250 --> 11:11.250]  With the federal standard, it says any piece of the plant has to test at 0.3%.
[11:11.250 --> 11:14.250]  I'm just hearing with what we were talking about, anything that's above 6%
[11:14.250 --> 11:18.250]  is going to be getting closer to that hot value.
[11:18.250 --> 11:23.250]  So is there a way to, how do we navigate that going forward?
[11:23.250 --> 11:29.250]  Just taking the flower off, just isolating the flower, like most stuff out there is hot.
[11:29.250 --> 11:35.250]  But if you blend it all together as biomass, then it's not going to be hot.
[11:35.250 --> 11:38.250]  We have a sampling protocol for the top 10 centimeters of the plant.
[11:38.250 --> 11:41.250]  That's the one that we're sticking with.
[11:41.250 --> 11:44.250]  We're trying to be consistent with what other states do as well
[11:44.250 --> 11:48.250]  so that there wouldn't be any situation where New York state products
[11:48.250 --> 11:52.250]  might have some taint to them with regard to interstate transportation
[11:52.250 --> 11:56.250]  if we weren't held to the same standard as other people.
[11:57.250 --> 12:02.250]  A farmer I was talking to the other day was talking about growing corn
[12:02.250 --> 12:05.250]  and there may not be some consensus on growing corn and having marijuana
[12:05.250 --> 12:07.250]  showing up in his farm.
[12:07.250 --> 12:09.250]  Is there a possibility that that would happen?
[12:09.250 --> 12:11.250]  How is that? Is there a regulation for that?
[12:11.250 --> 12:14.250]  Or how do you deal with that?
[12:14.250 --> 12:20.250]  So the question is with regard to some marijuana plants that are showing up
[12:20.250 --> 12:23.250]  in fields that are planted to some other crop?
[12:23.250 --> 12:25.250]  Or to hemp.
[12:25.250 --> 12:27.250]  It happens with the corn farm.
[12:27.250 --> 12:28.250]  It does.
[12:28.250 --> 12:33.250]  So basically you're saying what's the possibility of having unlicensed growers?
[12:33.250 --> 12:35.250]  Is that what you're asking?
[12:35.250 --> 12:37.250]  I think you're wondering, are you wondering about...
[12:37.250 --> 12:46.790]  If there's a road and there's a banana plant, is there a lot of...
[12:46.790 --> 12:48.790]  There's no regulation that would address that.
[12:48.790 --> 12:52.790]  Are you worried about if your field tested hot because of that crop?
[12:52.790 --> 12:55.790]  People are doing those things now in corn fields.
[12:56.790 --> 13:01.790]  I would hope that the randomness of our sampling protocol
[13:01.790 --> 13:04.790]  would take that worry away.
[13:04.790 --> 13:07.790]  If that wasn't the case and if it was a special circumstance
[13:07.790 --> 13:11.790]  that you could prove that there was some renegade crop growing there,
[13:11.790 --> 13:14.790]  we could probably take a look at that, have our inspectors come back out
[13:14.790 --> 13:16.790]  and see exactly what's going on.
[13:16.790 --> 13:18.790]  Until the other review of your farm.
[13:18.790 --> 13:20.790]  Until it falls into law enforcement's hands.
[13:20.790 --> 13:22.790]  Right.
[13:22.790 --> 13:24.790]  So one last question for me.
[13:24.790 --> 13:26.790]  Okay, I'll allow it.
[13:29.790 --> 13:36.790]  Will you have a published procedure for how you will handle a noncompliant test?
[13:36.790 --> 13:39.790]  And what will be the steps that you or law enforcement will take
[13:39.790 --> 13:41.790]  after that noncompliant test?
[13:41.790 --> 13:43.790]  Will there be a second test?
[13:43.790 --> 13:46.790]  Will law enforcement be brought to the field?
[13:46.790 --> 13:48.790]  What's going to happen?
[13:48.790 --> 13:50.790]  Larry always has to do this to me.
[13:50.790 --> 13:53.790]  He asks me a question I don't know the answer to.
[13:53.790 --> 13:56.790]  That procedure, that policy has not yet been established.
[13:56.790 --> 14:00.790]  But we are going to have to come up with a destruction policy.
[14:00.790 --> 14:03.790]  It is not our intention to be law enforcement
[14:03.790 --> 14:07.790]  or take the place of law enforcement's jurisdiction.
[14:07.790 --> 14:10.790]  If somebody in our program ends up with a field that's hot,
[14:10.790 --> 14:13.790]  we will work with them to destroy the crop.
[14:13.790 --> 14:15.790]  And we will not.
[14:15.790 --> 14:17.790]  Our first call is not going to be to law enforcement
[14:17.790 --> 14:20.790]  to get them jammed up in a legal proceeding.
[14:20.790 --> 14:22.790]  We want this program to succeed.
[14:22.790 --> 14:25.790]  We want our program participants to succeed.
[14:25.790 --> 14:28.790]  So we'll do everything we can within the law.
[14:28.790 --> 14:32.790]  And we have to keep in mind that we're going to have the federal government
[14:32.790 --> 14:35.790]  looking at us to make sure that we're doing everything we need to do
[14:35.790 --> 14:38.790]  to stay compliant with their requirements.
[14:38.790 --> 14:40.790]  Okay. Thanks a lot, Tim.
[14:40.790 --> 14:42.790]  Okay.
[14:42.790 --> 14:48.150]  If you guys want to follow along.
[14:50.150 --> 14:53.150]  It's a little bit different than some of the other handouts
[14:53.150 --> 14:57.150]  because the entire first page is about the weather.
[14:59.150 --> 15:02.150]  So I'm sure there's a lot of growers from different,
[15:02.150 --> 15:05.150]  not just hemp, in the group.
[15:05.150 --> 15:09.150]  And we've had a couple rough years, the last two.
[15:09.150 --> 15:15.150]  2017 was the first time we got an actual spring planting of hemp.
[15:15.150 --> 15:18.150]  And it was wet.
[15:18.150 --> 15:20.150]  It was a wet spring.
[15:20.150 --> 15:22.150]  We planted late.
[15:22.150 --> 15:25.150]  In some of our locations we had lots of pythium,
[15:25.150 --> 15:28.150]  so we lost a lot of seedlings to that.
[15:30.150 --> 15:33.150]  And then it sort of turned into this beautiful summer.
[15:33.150 --> 15:37.150]  So all of our seedlings that survived the pythium grew beautifully.
[15:37.150 --> 15:40.150]  We had amazing yields.
[15:40.150 --> 15:44.150]  I've looked at other trials from around the country,
[15:44.150 --> 15:49.150]  and it was just like, yeah, we can definitely grow hemp for grain
[15:49.150 --> 15:51.150]  and fiber in New York.
[15:51.150 --> 15:53.150]  We can do this.
[15:53.150 --> 15:58.150]  And then we had a beautiful, long, dry, warm fall.
[15:58.150 --> 16:01.150]  So everything got harvested.
[16:01.150 --> 16:03.150]  It was nice.
[16:03.150 --> 16:05.150]  It was really nice.
[16:05.150 --> 16:11.150]  Our highest yielding cultivar for grain was over a ton per acre.
[16:11.150 --> 16:13.150]  Very fun.
[16:13.150 --> 16:16.150]  Sorry, there's a bunch of people that are wanting to follow along
[16:16.150 --> 16:18.150]  with one of the handles.
[16:18.150 --> 16:20.150]  My bad.
[16:20.150 --> 16:23.150]  Slack it off.
[16:23.150 --> 16:27.150]  And then our fiber yields were also really high.
[16:27.150 --> 16:34.150]  So we had 6.5 dry tons per acre was our biomass produced,
[16:34.150 --> 16:37.150]  and that was in 72 days.
[16:37.150 --> 16:40.150]  So that's enormous.
[16:40.150 --> 16:43.150]  And then we had last year.
[16:44.150 --> 16:48.150]  So, again, we had a pretty wet spring,
[16:48.150 --> 16:51.150]  so we planted a little bit later than we had hoped.
[16:51.150 --> 16:56.150]  And then finally things dried out enough to plant,
[16:56.150 --> 16:59.150]  and it was like someone had turned the faucet off.
[16:59.150 --> 17:03.150]  Like we had five to six weeks of just drought.
[17:03.150 --> 17:08.150]  So we had pretty poor seedling stands,
[17:08.150 --> 17:11.150]  and then in addition to that, because of the drought,
[17:11.150 --> 17:14.150]  we had a lot of stunting.
[17:14.150 --> 17:16.150]  The plants were just stunted.
[17:16.150 --> 17:18.150]  We were watching it, you know, watching it like,
[17:18.150 --> 17:20.150]  you can do it, plants.
[17:20.150 --> 17:22.150]  We're little cheerleaders.
[17:22.150 --> 17:25.150]  And we thought we might be okay because it was dry enough
[17:25.150 --> 17:28.150]  that the weeds weren't growing either.
[17:28.150 --> 17:31.150]  And then the rain started coming.
[17:31.150 --> 17:34.150]  Everyone prayed way too hard for rain last summer.
[17:34.150 --> 17:37.150]  I think that was the key because once it started,
[17:37.150 --> 17:40.150]  it didn't stop until the spring.
[17:40.150 --> 17:43.150]  And the weeds just took off.
[17:43.150 --> 17:47.150]  And the weeds outgrew all of our shorter varieties.
[17:47.150 --> 17:55.150]  And then, like I said, it just didn't stop raining.
[17:55.150 --> 18:01.150]  And so we had some big disease pressure later on in the season.
[18:01.150 --> 18:07.150]  Our grain yields were half that of what they were the year before.
[18:07.150 --> 18:11.150]  The fiber yields weren't impacted nearly as much,
[18:11.150 --> 18:17.150]  but they were still four and a half tons versus six and a half tons.
[18:17.150 --> 18:23.150]  Four and a half tons is still a lot of biomass to produce in 75 days.
[18:23.150 --> 18:29.150]  But, you know, it just still wasn't,
[18:29.150 --> 18:32.150]  because the stands weren't as good to start out with,
[18:32.150 --> 18:34.150]  wasn't as good as the year before.
[18:34.150 --> 18:38.150]  And then our grains yields were less, about half as much.
[18:38.150 --> 18:40.150]  So there's a nice graph on the back.
[18:40.150 --> 18:46.150]  So for this data, we had 13 grain varieties in 2017,
[18:46.150 --> 18:49.150]  and then four fiber types.
[18:49.150 --> 18:55.150]  We also had the four fiber types in 2018, but we added to it.
[18:55.150 --> 19:03.150]  So we ended up having closer to 25 grain and dual-purpose types.
[19:03.150 --> 19:06.150]  But I didn't include that information in here,
[19:06.150 --> 19:11.150]  because I just wanted to compare the same varieties in both years.
[19:11.150 --> 19:15.150]  But I think the big difference that we saw in the grain that we harvested
[19:15.150 --> 19:18.150]  was the fusarium on the grain.
[19:18.150 --> 19:20.150]  I'm not going to talk about that too much,
[19:20.150 --> 19:25.150]  because Gary will be up here in a little bit.
[19:25.150 --> 19:31.150]  So there was a detectable vomitoxin in some of our trials,
[19:31.150 --> 19:37.150]  so especially trials that were in locations around areas
[19:37.150 --> 19:41.150]  where a lot of other wheat and barley and oats are produced.
[19:41.150 --> 19:43.150]  Those ones had very high levels.
[19:43.150 --> 19:50.150]  We had our highest detectable level of vomitoxin was 36.6 parts per million
[19:50.150 --> 19:51.150]  on some of our hemp.
[19:51.150 --> 19:55.150]  So that's a lot, right?
[19:55.150 --> 20:01.150]  I think the cutoff for food is one to two parts per million,
[20:01.150 --> 20:04.150]  depending on what the main use is going to be.
[20:04.150 --> 20:12.150]  And so looking at this grain and seeing 36.6 parts per million was a shock,
[20:12.150 --> 20:16.150]  for sure.
[20:16.150 --> 20:20.150]  The other quality components of the grain were different as well.
[20:20.150 --> 20:28.150]  So in 2017, it was close to 36% oil in the seeds,
[20:28.150 --> 20:35.150]  and it was around 29% in 2018, so there was a big drop there as well.
[20:35.150 --> 20:39.150]  You could look at the grain and see it was not of the right quality.
[20:39.150 --> 20:40.150]  It was weathered-looking.
[20:40.150 --> 20:43.150]  There was lots more broken pieces.
[20:43.150 --> 20:49.150]  You could see discoloration from the disease all around.
[20:50.150 --> 20:55.150]  In my head, we had one awesome year, which can show the potential.
[20:55.150 --> 20:58.150]  New York can do this.
[20:58.150 --> 21:00.150]  We've got the potential.
[21:00.150 --> 21:04.150]  The seed sources are there.
[21:04.150 --> 21:09.150]  And then the next year, it was just like, whoa, we're going to need some more tools
[21:09.150 --> 21:17.680]  if we're going to be able to manage this and really keep this going as a crop.
[21:17.680 --> 21:26.360]  Questions?
[21:26.360 --> 21:31.360]  All of our certified seed lots were fine for THC.
[21:31.360 --> 21:51.430]  Nothing came even close to the 0.3% limit.
[21:51.430 --> 21:57.430]  He was asking if the Fusarium was a blue wind from the neighboring fields,
[21:57.430 --> 21:59.430]  and that is very likely the chance.
[21:59.430 --> 22:06.430]  Last year was a really bad year for Fusarium on all of the small grains and corn and hemp.
[22:06.430 --> 22:13.830]  It was all over just a really bad year for Fusarium.
[22:13.830 --> 22:21.810]  Thank you, Jamie.
[22:21.810 --> 22:27.810]  Greg Carlson, just going to give a quick update on our breeding program here.
[22:27.810 --> 22:33.810]  These cultivar trials are really good at informing New York farmers,
[22:33.810 --> 22:38.810]  but they also inform breeders like me.
[22:38.810 --> 22:44.810]  Our breeding program is primarily focused on developing disease-resistant,
[22:44.810 --> 22:54.810]  high-yielding varieties with decent oil and protein content and diverse cannabinoid profiles.
[22:54.810 --> 22:59.810]  So we make selections from some of these cultivars that we've tested in the field.
[22:59.810 --> 23:03.810]  We've been doing this for the past three years.
[23:03.810 --> 23:10.810]  This year we identified a subset of high-yielding dual-purpose cultivars that have good grain yield
[23:10.810 --> 23:16.810]  along with good cannabinoid profiles.
[23:16.810 --> 23:25.810]  What we did is we took seed lots from these particular varieties
[23:25.810 --> 23:30.810]  and grew them out in seed flats.
[23:30.810 --> 23:39.810]  We made early selections at the seedling stage based on plant seedling vigor or height, lack of disease.
[23:39.810 --> 23:49.810]  Then from there we're using high-throughput molecular markers to first identify a cannabinoid type
[23:49.810 --> 24:01.810]  or hemp type or marijuana type so we can create progeny that are homozygous hemp types.
[24:01.810 --> 24:07.810]  We want to make hemp populations. We don't want to make hemp marijuana populations.
[24:07.810 --> 24:17.810]  We saw that a lot of these cultivars from the last couple of years have been segregating for hemp and marijuana type.
[24:18.810 --> 24:25.810]  If you want to talk to Jacob, he's in our lab. He talked a little bit about that earlier.
[24:25.810 --> 24:32.810]  If you want to talk to me about that more or Jacob more, just come up and ask us.
[24:32.810 --> 24:37.810]  What we do is we're screening these plants for cannabinoid type.
[24:37.810 --> 24:46.810]  Then what we want to do is select from that subset a percentage of females and a percentage of males that are hemp type.
[24:46.810 --> 24:56.810]  Then we'll bring in hemp type females into greenhouse ranges, different varieties of these hemp females,
[24:56.810 --> 25:04.810]  and introduce them to a single male cultivar that we've also screened.
[25:04.810 --> 25:14.810]  From there we bulk those seeds, clean it, and plant it out in the field.
[25:14.810 --> 25:19.810]  This year we planted out I think 10 crosses.
[25:19.810 --> 25:23.810]  We're still working on some more in the greenhouse.
[25:23.810 --> 25:27.810]  We've also done some feminized populations that we're doing selections on.
[25:27.810 --> 25:41.810]  From there we'll make selections in the field, bring them into the greenhouse, and use those for our future crosses.
[25:42.810 --> 25:50.810]  We don't have to rely on isolation. We don't have to fear pollen in the field.
[25:50.810 --> 26:01.810]  We're actually wanting to go out and do some cultivar evaluations in the field, all in one big field, instead of isolated blocks three miles apart from one another.
[26:01.810 --> 26:05.810]  We just don't have the tools to do that right now.
[26:06.810 --> 26:19.810]  We've also evaluated different feral populations from Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska, and some New York feral populations,
[26:19.810 --> 26:26.810]  as well as different feminized populations and dioecious populations of varying pedigrees.
[26:26.810 --> 26:33.810]  It would be interesting to see what kind of traits we can garner from those populations.
[26:33.810 --> 26:44.810]  Again, like Larry said, we're doing genotyping just to look at the genetic diversity of the plants that New York farmers are planting around the state.
[26:44.810 --> 26:47.810]  We've done this for a year.
[26:47.810 --> 26:51.810]  We have two plates of GBS, or it's genotyping by sequencing.
[26:51.810 --> 26:54.810]  It's our genotyping method.
[26:54.810 --> 26:57.810]  We're going to submit another plate soon.
[26:57.810 --> 27:04.810]  If you're interested in getting your plants that you're growing genotyped, there won't be any cost to you.
[27:04.810 --> 27:11.810]  We'll visit your field, collect your sample from your plant, and then we'll share it with you.
[27:11.810 --> 27:18.810]  We want to be as open as possible in our breeding program, in our genotyping program, and we'll offer that.
[27:19.810 --> 27:33.810]  We'll throw that up online so you can see where your plants sit in the entire galaxy of our genetic diversity that we see here.
[27:33.810 --> 27:36.810]  Thank you.
[27:36.810 --> 27:38.810]  One quick question.
[27:38.810 --> 27:41.810]  Just come up and talk to me if you want to do that.
[27:41.810 --> 27:46.810]  I've got a sign-up sheet, and if you know your cultivars offhand, you can just write those down.
[27:47.810 --> 27:57.810]  Let me just give just a two-second summary of what we've learned so far, and we haven't gotten our second set of 95 samples back.
[27:57.810 --> 28:04.810]  Not every variety is named according to its genetic makeup.
[28:04.810 --> 28:11.810]  Sometimes names don't match genetics, and that can be interesting.
[28:12.810 --> 28:18.810]  Also, we do see groupings of different cultivars into distinct genetic groups.
[28:18.810 --> 28:26.810]  We would like to expand that analysis with another 95 samples, so if you're interested in doing that, please let us know.
[28:26.810 --> 28:29.810]  Thanks very much, Craig.
[28:29.810 --> 28:41.310]  Certainly, with a new crop on the landscape, the risk of diseases is imminent.
[28:42.310 --> 28:50.310]  We're very fortunate to have Gary Bergstrom here to talk about the surveys and the characterizations they've done of hemp diseases so far.
[28:50.310 --> 28:52.310]  Hello, everybody.
[28:52.310 --> 29:01.310]  I'd like to start out by acknowledging two people in my lab that are really at the forefront of our diagnostic effort, GenStar.
[29:01.310 --> 29:04.310]  Kevin Myers, would you stand up there?
[29:04.310 --> 29:12.310]  All three of us will be around and would love to visit with you about things that you think may be diseases that you're seeing in your fields.
[29:12.310 --> 29:16.310]  I think we will all agree we're still learning a lot.
[29:16.310 --> 29:31.310]  This is the third year of our effort in surveillance to try to find out what's going on in commercial fields of hemp, as well as in some of the kind of variety trials that you've seen here today.
[29:31.310 --> 29:33.310]  If you noticed, it was by and large pretty clean.
[29:33.310 --> 29:35.310]  We found that little bit of powdery mildew.
[29:35.310 --> 29:44.310]  We did collect a few very minor leaf spots, and you may have noticed a few plants showing wilting on one side of the plant.
[29:44.310 --> 29:48.310]  I think there's some fusarium wilt in a relatively few plants out there.
[29:49.310 --> 30:06.310]  With certainty, as we intensify production of this crop like any other crop we grow, if we have it grown in more fields and have it grown more intensively with greater frequency in any particular field,
[30:06.310 --> 30:12.310]  we're likely to see eventually an increase in some of our disease problems.
[30:12.310 --> 30:19.310]  At the onset here, we're trying to record everything, even some insignificant little spot on a leaf.
[30:19.310 --> 30:23.310]  We're trying to find out what organism causes it.
[30:23.310 --> 30:28.310]  Is there super susceptibility in some of our varieties, et cetera?
[30:28.310 --> 30:36.310]  We're trying to get a handle on all of that, and we're very interested in collaborating with all of you, a lot more eyes and ears here.
[30:36.310 --> 30:41.310]  We certainly aren't getting to the vast majority of your fields.
[30:41.310 --> 30:53.310]  Keep us in mind, either through your cooperative extension educator in your local area, and a number of them are here with us today, or contact me or those in my lab.
[30:53.310 --> 30:55.310]  We'd be very interested in that.
[30:55.310 --> 30:57.310]  At this point, where are we?
[30:57.310 --> 31:03.310]  We basically want to minimize diseases as a factor in the production of this crop.
[31:04.310 --> 31:13.310]  Since you've already heard a couple of times, we don't have registered, legal, available, and efficacious fungicides as one of the tools at this point.
[31:13.310 --> 31:16.310]  I think this will change over time.
[31:16.310 --> 31:21.310]  But we have very good agronomic practices that we can put in place.
[31:21.310 --> 31:26.310]  For starters, put a lot of emphasis on site selection.
[31:26.310 --> 31:32.310]  You've heard that the sites on your farm where you're going to grow the crop, we need a well-drained site.
[31:32.310 --> 31:33.310]  Okay?
[31:33.310 --> 31:38.310]  Pythium's going to be a problem, and it's not going to be adapted to every field on your farm.
[31:38.310 --> 31:52.310]  We also know right off the bat that this is a crop that is very susceptible to white mold fungus, the Sclerotinia fungus, which is a very wide host range fungus.
[31:53.310 --> 32:03.310]  This is already a principal problem for us in this state in growing crops like dry beans, snap beans, soybeans, a number of other vegetable crops.
[32:03.310 --> 32:14.310]  We know that if we have white mold problem in those other crops, it's only going to lead to a white mold problem in the hemp if we follow those in rotation.
[32:14.310 --> 32:22.310]  Being aware of not only the hemp and the hemp varieties, but what is the previous cropping history in the field is very important.
[32:22.310 --> 32:39.310]  You're going to hear in a little bit here from Dr. Alan Taylor, who's going to talk about some of the pioneering work on looking at efficacy of different synthetic chemicals and biological materials for application to seed.
[32:40.310 --> 32:48.310]  To try to get some control of some of these seed-borne and early growth soil-borne microorganisms.
[32:48.310 --> 32:52.310]  I won't say a lot about that, other than to say that that is a critical issue.
[32:52.310 --> 32:59.310]  Probably where we need pesticides the most is getting that seed out of the ground, getting a vigorous initial stand.
[32:59.310 --> 33:03.310]  Hopefully that will be one of the first developments in that arena.
[33:04.310 --> 33:08.310]  A good seed bed is important as well, to really prepare the ground well.
[33:08.310 --> 33:13.310]  I don't know how much anybody is planting in a no-till situation right now.
[33:13.310 --> 33:21.310]  That has some, probably not too much, and that's probably just as well because that has some other complications as well as far as seed emergence.
[33:21.310 --> 33:28.310]  Depending on what the crop residue from the previous crop, we could be carrying along pathogens from a previous crop.
[33:29.310 --> 33:34.310]  My biggest concerns are at the two ends of the growing season.
[33:34.310 --> 33:39.310]  Getting that seedling out of the ground, getting it protected that way.
[33:39.310 --> 33:48.310]  In our program, we're putting a lot of current emphasis on the end of the season kind of problems of diseases and also mycotoxins.
[33:48.310 --> 33:55.310]  One of the things that's nearly universal that I've seen in looking at fields is Botrytis gray mold.
[33:55.310 --> 34:01.310]  It has that gray, webby growth all over the floral parts and whatnot.
[34:01.310 --> 34:04.310]  That's going to be problematic for any end use.
[34:04.310 --> 34:08.310]  Kind of an anti-quality factor there.
[34:08.310 --> 34:10.310]  We're aware of that.
[34:10.310 --> 34:15.310]  There may or may not turn out to be some varietal differences along that line.
[34:15.310 --> 34:17.310]  Hopefully we could see something like that.
[34:17.310 --> 34:24.310]  Also, I know Chris's group is doing some work with some of the same chemicals.
[34:24.310 --> 34:31.310]  She's looking against powdery mildew, interested in finding something that might have efficacy against Botrytis as well.
[34:31.310 --> 34:42.310]  I'm concentrating very much on the fungi that will colonize the finished product, either the grain, the seed, or those buds.
[34:42.310 --> 34:46.310]  What we find is a predominance of Fusarium fungi.
[34:46.310 --> 34:51.310]  Fusarium is notorious for producing mycotoxins.
[34:52.310 --> 35:05.310]  I've spent the better part of my career working in cereal crops where the principal problem has been Fusarium head blight and contamination of the grain with deoxynivalanol, also known as vomitoxin.
[35:05.310 --> 35:16.310]  It was at least a mild surprise to me to start looking at quality in the hemp and finding that those same problems are very prevalent there.
[35:16.310 --> 35:27.310]  We're finding a diversity of Fusarium species, particularly Fusarium graminierum, which is the principal problem we have on corn and small grain cereals.
[35:27.310 --> 35:33.310]  Which does, in the long term, open up the whole crop rotation question a little bit as well.
[35:33.310 --> 35:45.310]  The wisdom would be, if we're having problems with white mold and we have some commonality with maybe some of our diseases of vegetables in some cases, that grain crops would be a great rotation.
[35:45.310 --> 35:47.310]  There's a caveat on that.
[35:47.310 --> 35:56.310]  We have to look at that and I think that we have to be conscious of how Fusarium might be building up in the grain crop that precedes the hemp crop.
[35:56.310 --> 35:58.310]  We have a lot to learn about that.
[35:58.310 --> 36:10.310]  Again, we may get super lucky and find a variety or some genes in particular that would confer resistance to Fusarium, but I wouldn't hold out a lot of hope on that.
[36:10.310 --> 36:17.310]  I've been working in cereal systems for my fourth decade now and it is still an elusive problem genetically.
[36:17.310 --> 36:24.310]  We have been able to basically sort out the super susceptible varieties and kind of push them to the side.
[36:24.310 --> 36:30.310]  We have found genetic control that moderates an intermediate level of resistance.
[36:30.310 --> 36:39.310]  Yet, when it rains, when the crops flower and we have the fungus in the air, we will get Fusarium developed and we will have mycotoxins.
[36:40.310 --> 36:47.310]  Jamie, maybe scared you a little bit about that one figure about 36 parts per million and that I'm hoping is an extreme case,
[36:47.310 --> 36:55.310]  but we've been looking at seed lots from the last couple of years and it's not unusual to have four, five, six parts per million.
[36:55.310 --> 37:01.310]  The FDA guidelines for any human food product is one part per million.
[37:01.310 --> 37:06.310]  There will be some effort made to try to bring things down to that.
[37:07.310 --> 37:19.310]  One of the things that we're actively looking at in our research program is we're looking at the possibility of both organically approved type fungicide materials,
[37:19.310 --> 37:28.310]  biofungicides, as well as more traditional chemical fungicides, and we're applying that at the outset of flowering on the crop.
[37:28.310 --> 37:32.310]  We have some experiment, we're doing some timings on that too.
[37:32.310 --> 37:44.310]  We would like to see what potential that has in bringing down, suppressing the levels of this deoxynivalanol toxin in the grain or in the buds.
[37:44.310 --> 37:47.310]  That's something we feel is pretty high priority right now.
[37:47.310 --> 37:53.310]  Talking about in the middle of the growing season, we've seen an awful lot of different things.
[37:53.310 --> 37:59.310]  We've seen some of these vascular wilt disorders, haven't seen a complete wipe out of many fields of that,
[37:59.310 --> 38:08.310]  but we've seen some serious problems in a couple of cases with pythium root rot that starts early in the season and progresses into killing whole plants.
[38:08.310 --> 38:12.310]  Also the fusarium fungus in soils can do that.
[38:12.310 --> 38:16.310]  You may have seen some stray plants in the plots this morning that showed fusarium wilt.
[38:16.310 --> 38:26.310]  What we have seen is a whole diversity of fungal leaf spots, and some of them really very minor.
[38:27.310 --> 38:30.310]  You know, have to look a long way in a row and find a couple spots here and there.
[38:30.310 --> 38:42.310]  And a couple of diseases, in particular one we call bipolaris leaf spot, that seems some connection with varieties as well, but it can be severe blighting of the whole canopy.
[38:42.310 --> 38:53.310]  So we will be looking primarily at genetic varietal selection in the future as a means of combating some of those things.
[38:53.310 --> 39:00.310]  So we look forward to working together with Larry's program and others here to try to get a better handle on those things.
[39:00.310 --> 39:03.310]  If you're into Latin names, there's a few on that sheet there.
[39:03.310 --> 39:09.310]  They're all kinds of genera of fungi that we have found associated with these blights.
[39:09.310 --> 39:16.310]  And we're methodically working through proving their pathogenicity, isolating them in pure culture,
[39:16.310 --> 39:23.310]  and inoculating them onto different varieties of hemp in the greenhouse and seeing to what extent they are pathogenic.
[39:23.310 --> 39:29.310]  Another interesting question is the host range of some of these pathogenic microbes.
[39:29.310 --> 39:41.310]  For instance, we found some organisms that we haven't proven yet, but very similar organism found on the weeds nearby in our hemp plots.
[39:41.310 --> 39:49.310]  So it could be that weed control is also important in the epidemiology of some of these diseases.
[39:49.310 --> 39:58.310]  So we have a tremendous amount to learn, and we look forward to you being students along with us and help us to learn some of these things.
[39:58.310 --> 40:03.310]  So are there some questions or some observations you'd like to share?
[40:04.310 --> 40:13.310]  Okay, the question was whether we have found any difference in susceptibility, if you will, between the monoecious and dioecious varieties.
[40:13.310 --> 40:21.310]  Since we're basically just looking, we're not inoculating anything, so there's no controlled experiments to do that comparison.
[40:21.310 --> 40:23.310]  So we can't definitively describe that.
[40:24.310 --> 40:33.310]  The vast majority of the varieties in field settings we've seen so far, disease is fairly uncommon.
[40:33.310 --> 40:41.310]  Most of the plants of all types are looking, well, I won't say resistant because they may not have been exposed to the inoculum.
[40:41.310 --> 40:44.310]  But I don't have any general observation on that line.
[40:44.310 --> 40:48.310]  Is there some information anybody's aware of along that line?
[40:48.310 --> 40:50.310]  Yeah, we've been growing it for 20 years.
[40:50.310 --> 40:51.310]  Good.
[40:51.310 --> 40:57.310]  And my, for 21 years, it's come out, but I don't know if we've been using it.
[40:57.310 --> 41:08.400]  I appreciate that observation, and we can try to look at that a little more closely.
[41:08.400 --> 41:09.400]  That's very helpful.
[41:09.400 --> 41:10.400]  Thank you.
[41:10.400 --> 41:11.400]  Thank you.
[41:11.400 --> 41:19.400]  So I'm just curious if anybody that's been growing the crop has had any significant production issue with disease?
[41:21.400 --> 41:22.400]  They don't want to be the only one, so.
[41:22.400 --> 41:24.400]  Okay, come talk to me privately.
[41:24.400 --> 41:25.400]  Thank you.
[41:25.400 --> 41:36.280]  And our last speaker of the afternoon is Dr. Alan Taylor, who is a seed scientist here at Cornell Agritech
[41:36.280 --> 41:42.280]  and has been doing some research on seed treatments and their interaction with soil pathogens.
[41:42.280 --> 41:43.280]  Alan.
[41:46.280 --> 41:47.280]  Thanks, Larry.
[41:47.280 --> 41:51.280]  You can see quite a number of speakers that we have today.
[41:52.280 --> 42:00.280]  But really, I want to say as a seed guy, to be a part of the Cornell hemp team has been really rewarding with this project.
[42:00.280 --> 42:08.280]  Pathologists, plant breeders, a cadre of people and their expertises that Chris and Larry have really pooled together their expertises
[42:08.280 --> 42:10.280]  so we can move together.
[42:10.280 --> 42:12.280]  So that's been really rewarding.
[42:12.280 --> 42:20.280]  So my program in the area of seed science and technology, besides what I'm going to be talking to you on the seed treatment project today,
[42:20.280 --> 42:24.280]  is we also try to provide support to the other ongoing projects.
[42:24.280 --> 42:30.280]  So when we're looking at some of the seed lots that are coming in, we'll do the germination, purity, seed quality.
[42:30.280 --> 42:37.280]  So we're doing that in conjunction with a larger project to kind of move everything forward.
[42:37.280 --> 42:38.280]  So we all kind of learn together.
[42:40.280 --> 42:47.280]  Tim talked about in his presentation from Ag and Markets about the big picture going on with the farm bill.
[42:48.280 --> 42:55.280]  And really, if I go back a year ago, when we started working with the seed treatments to really pitch this to this IR4 group,
[42:55.280 --> 43:00.280]  which is the national group which fosters registration for specialty crops,
[43:00.280 --> 43:08.280]  hemp is considered as a specialty crop, but that they would be working on biological and chemical seed treatments.
[43:08.280 --> 43:13.280]  And at that time, just a year ago at this time, before the 2018 farm bill was passed,
[43:14.280 --> 43:19.280]  it was all the industrial hemp, CBD hemp was lumped in with the recreational cannabis,
[43:19.280 --> 43:23.280]  so there's no pesticides were labeled on this.
[43:23.280 --> 43:25.280]  So this is really a void.
[43:25.280 --> 43:31.280]  However, there's already very mature materials, especially the chemical seed treatments that are already there,
[43:31.280 --> 43:34.280]  and you use this if you grow any other crops or even biological.
[43:34.280 --> 43:39.280]  So really, our project was kind of to pull some of this together,
[43:39.280 --> 43:43.280]  some of these promising materials that have already been used commercially on other crops,
[43:43.280 --> 43:46.280]  to see how they're going to work on hemp.
[43:46.280 --> 43:53.280]  I want to thank Gary who just talked about, first of all, the need, really a need of getting this crop,
[43:53.280 --> 43:58.280]  a direct seeded crop for an industrial for either fiber or for grain,
[43:58.280 --> 44:02.280]  to get it established in the seed treatments and how that can help that.
[44:02.280 --> 44:10.280]  Also, Gary's group have been very supportive in providing the pathology support for this project as well.
[44:10.280 --> 44:18.280]  So it's fortunate, again, getting back to this IR4 group, again, that they, their whole purpose is to foster registration.
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.280]  We have what's called their integrated solutions, which is one of their large programs,
[44:22.280 --> 44:29.280]  which become a multi-regional, so we have field studies they'll be talking about from Cornell at two locations.
[44:29.280 --> 44:34.280]  We also have field studies in the southern region at Virginia Tech,
[44:34.280 --> 44:40.280]  and then also at North Dakota State in the south central, excuse me, the north central region there.
[44:40.280 --> 44:47.280]  So when we did this, we've used one variety of Anka as a dual purpose variety,
[44:47.280 --> 44:52.280]  and Anka's been kind of our white rat that we do for a lot of our seed quality investigations,
[44:52.280 --> 44:55.280]  good quality seed lot to begin with.
[44:55.280 --> 45:00.280]  We've developed my laboratory, if I'm kind of working off of this handout, if you have it,
[45:00.280 --> 45:05.280]  the evaluation of seed treatments on industrial crops for management of damping off.
[45:05.280 --> 45:08.280]  So we have laboratory scale seed treatment equipment.
[45:08.280 --> 45:13.280]  My program's pretty unique in the United States for having small scale equipment
[45:13.280 --> 45:20.280]  that we can basically simulate what a larger seed company would be doing on treating many, many pounds of seeds.
[45:20.280 --> 45:25.280]  We can treat just an ounce of seed, which is fine for most of our trials.
[45:25.280 --> 45:27.280]  So we're able to do that in-house.
[45:27.280 --> 45:33.280]  We do a lot of screening on what seed treatment binders, some of the particulars that I'm not going to go into here.
[45:33.280 --> 45:37.280]  But the first thing we want to do is we're amassing this material.
[45:37.280 --> 45:42.280]  We're looking at biologicals, biologicals with two major biocontrol agents.
[45:42.280 --> 45:48.280]  It's either a beneficial fungi, trichoderma, or a beneficial bacteria, which are bacillus.
[45:48.280 --> 45:51.280]  And then we also had chemicals.
[45:51.280 --> 45:55.280]  Syngenta is the only chemical company that stepped up a year ago.
[45:55.280 --> 46:04.280]  So very mature materials, the Apron XL Maxim materials that are widely registered on vegetable as well as field crops.
[46:04.280 --> 46:07.280]  We also have biochemical materials.
[46:07.280 --> 46:09.280]  In the chemical group are called phosphites.
[46:09.280 --> 46:11.280]  You know phosphate as a fertilizer.
[46:11.280 --> 46:14.280]  But the phosphites are unique that they're systemic materials,
[46:15.280 --> 46:18.280]  but also have been shown in other systems to control pythium.
[46:18.280 --> 46:21.280]  So we wanted to include that.
[46:21.280 --> 46:27.280]  Number of pathogens, pythium, just like, again, Gary kind of set the stage for me to talk about this.
[46:27.280 --> 46:33.280]  Pythium has kind of been our key target pathogen, but also Fusarium and Rhizoctonia that can be there.
[46:33.280 --> 46:39.280]  We have a laboratory bioassay that we screened materials early on just to look at application rates.
[46:39.280 --> 46:42.280]  Also if there's any potential phytotoxicity as we're applying materials.
[46:42.280 --> 46:50.280]  Again, for the first time on hemp, we don't know what that seed treatment crop combination is going to yield.
[46:50.280 --> 46:53.280]  So we did all that type of background information.
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.280]  If you're interested in the data, it's on the back sheet.
[46:57.280 --> 47:03.280]  And to try to simplify, because there's 15 treatments, and rather than to try to go through all this,
[47:03.280 --> 47:06.280]  we color-coded this to really kind of simplify.
[47:07.280 --> 47:10.280]  And if you don't have it, you can almost see it from here.
[47:10.280 --> 47:14.280]  The stand improves here, and then we see all these treatments.
[47:14.280 --> 47:17.280]  In blue are the chemical seed treatments.
[47:17.280 --> 47:21.280]  That's the Apron XL Maxim combination doing very well.
[47:21.280 --> 47:23.280]  And you would expect that.
[47:23.280 --> 47:27.280]  They're very well-developed chemistries for control.
[47:27.280 --> 47:32.280]  The two black treatments are the non-treated seeds, so that's our check.
[47:32.280 --> 47:35.280]  And then all these greens are the biological.
[47:35.280 --> 47:45.280]  So the biologicals in our hands on hemp is affording really no appreciable protection against early-season damping off.
[47:45.280 --> 47:47.280]  This is just based on our two field studies.
[47:47.280 --> 47:53.280]  We had the field study conducted in East Ithaca, and I want to thank Jamie, who just talked to you a few minutes ago,
[47:53.280 --> 48:02.280]  helping coordinate that site, and then the Geneva site that Larry's group was very supportive in helping us getting that one launched as well.
[48:02.280 --> 48:04.280]  So we're really at the first year with this.
[48:04.280 --> 48:12.280]  At this point in time, I'm still waiting for the data from the Virginia Tech sites and the North Dakota so we can start filling this in.
[48:12.280 --> 48:16.280]  And, again, that's really the purpose of having a multi-state, multi-region project,
[48:16.280 --> 48:24.280]  is in case we have flukes in our data, we want to see what sort of consistent trends there would be over the long run.
[48:24.280 --> 48:31.280]  We're in communication now with all the companies, four biological companies, the chemical company, things like that.
[48:31.280 --> 48:34.280]  So they are too abreast of this.
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.280]  The plans right now would be to continue this project for a second year.
[48:38.280 --> 48:44.280]  We'll be tweaking some things, going back to kind of the drawing board and looking at especially these biologicals,
[48:44.280 --> 48:52.280]  try to improve their efficacy to get them to improve better, especially using pythium as our target pathogen.
[48:52.280 --> 48:56.280]  So that's kind of very quickly in a nutshell kind of what we found.
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.280]  If there's any questions on this or other seed questions, yes?
[49:00.280 --> 49:03.280]  What were the three? You said pythium, fusarium, and rhizoctonia.
[49:03.280 --> 49:11.280]  Pythium, fusarium, and rhizoctonia are kind of the three key soil-borne pathogens that would be attacking the seed.
[49:11.280 --> 49:20.280]  And, again, when we had the naturally infested soil with pythium, Gary's group did the characterization of that pythium for us
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.280]  so we know what pathogen, what species that we're dealing with.
[49:23.280 --> 49:31.280]  And so with our roll-tell test, which is kind of a seed testing procedure, then we can screen things 24-7,
[49:31.280 --> 49:36.280]  and so we can see kind of what's going on, which treatments are doing well, which ones are not doing well.
[49:36.280 --> 49:40.280]  Yeah, thanks. Good question.
[49:40.280 --> 49:43.280]  Okay, I'll turn this back over to Larry so we can get on to you.
[49:43.280 --> 49:44.280]  Thank you, Rob.
