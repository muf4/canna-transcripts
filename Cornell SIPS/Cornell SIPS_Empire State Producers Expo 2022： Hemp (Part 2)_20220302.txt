[00:00.640 --> 00:04.680]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.680 --> 00:10.540]  Thank you, Mary.
[00:10.540 --> 00:12.540]  So hi, everyone.
[00:12.540 --> 00:14.060]  Thank you very much for being here.
[00:14.060 --> 00:15.300]  I'm Dr. Daniela Vergara.
[00:15.300 --> 00:18.340]  I'm the Emerging Crops Specialist
[00:18.340 --> 00:21.340]  from the Harvest New York team
[00:21.340 --> 00:24.100]  at the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[00:24.100 --> 00:27.740]  And it is a great honor and
[00:27.740 --> 00:30.160]  pleasure to introduce Mandy Kerr,
[00:30.160 --> 00:33.500]  who is the lead from the Global Hemp Association.
[00:33.600 --> 00:36.600]  I met Mandy maybe a year ago or so.
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.400]  We've been talking very often lately
[00:41.400 --> 00:44.400]  because she runs this incredible platform
[00:44.400 --> 00:47.000]  that she's been able to get people together
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.900]  from all over the US and internationally.
[00:50.900 --> 00:54.560]  And she runs all platforms regarding hemp.
[00:54.560 --> 00:58.940]  So if you want to know someone who's processing fiber
[00:58.940 --> 01:01.760]  or grain or CBD, or who's growing it,
[01:01.760 --> 01:05.560]  or anyone here or elsewhere in the world,
[01:05.560 --> 01:07.920]  Mandy is your person to contact.
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.060]  She has an incredible list of people
[01:11.060 --> 01:14.160]  from seed to sale, everywhere in between,
[01:14.160 --> 01:16.500]  and processing everywhere in between.
[01:16.500 --> 01:19.760]  And I think I am a big admirer of what she's done
[01:19.760 --> 01:22.620]  from scratch, because she did it from scratch.
[01:22.620 --> 01:26.200]  Not only because she's able to connect a bunch of people,
[01:26.200 --> 01:29.320]  and so I totally recommend to go to her website
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.960]  and to visit her website,
[01:30.960 --> 01:33.720]  but also because she is really good
[01:33.720 --> 01:36.400]  at knowing what other people know
[01:36.400 --> 01:38.360]  and not knowing what she needs to know.
[01:38.360 --> 01:41.320]  Like, I need to figure out this, who do I need to contact?
[01:41.320 --> 01:44.320]  So I really, really want to highlight
[01:44.320 --> 01:45.520]  the Global Hemp Association
[01:45.520 --> 01:48.000]  and all of the work that Mandy has done.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.660]  And with that, Mandy, please take it.
[01:51.660 --> 01:52.500]  You're awesome.
[01:52.500 --> 01:53.960]  I'll have to pay you later for that intro.
[01:53.960 --> 01:55.020]  That was very, very nice.
[01:55.020 --> 01:55.860]  And thank you.
[01:55.860 --> 01:57.120]  Thank you very much for having me, you guys.
[01:57.120 --> 01:58.320]  I'm really excited.
[01:58.360 --> 02:01.880]  So again, like Daniela said, my name is Mandy Kerr.
[02:01.880 --> 02:03.640]  I started the Global Hemp Association
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.800]  a couple of years ago,
[02:04.800 --> 02:07.320]  really with the focus of creating a platform
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.040]  where we could connect the entire supply chain.
[02:11.040 --> 02:13.400]  And I really went into this with a focus
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.400]  of the industrial applications and fiber,
[02:17.400 --> 02:19.120]  where there were a lot of organizations
[02:19.120 --> 02:21.800]  that were really focused on cannabinoid
[02:21.800 --> 02:24.440]  or siloed by state or industry,
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.320]  such as a building organization or hemp feed coalition.
[02:28.320 --> 02:30.080]  I really wanted to create a platform
[02:30.080 --> 02:31.640]  where we could start to connect
[02:31.640 --> 02:34.560]  and bridge those gaps between those organizations
[02:34.560 --> 02:38.480]  and between universities or entrepreneurs in the industry.
[02:38.480 --> 02:41.380]  And so I've hosted a number of different interviews.
[02:41.380 --> 02:42.960]  I host eight to 20 a month,
[02:42.960 --> 02:45.680]  where really, again, our focus is to highlight people
[02:45.680 --> 02:47.360]  that are doing it right in the industry
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.600]  and give people an opportunity to educate
[02:50.600 --> 02:52.360]  and promote what they're doing.
[02:52.360 --> 02:55.880]  And so our mission really is to build a secure
[02:55.880 --> 02:57.920]  and transparent, trusted infrastructure
[02:57.920 --> 03:00.560]  that encourages collaboration and connection
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.040]  between farmers, processors, manufacturers, and marketers.
[03:04.040 --> 03:05.880]  And then we focus, like I said,
[03:05.880 --> 03:08.320]  on all aspects of the industry,
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.240]  but really have taken a fiber focus first
[03:12.240 --> 03:14.360]  in this initial round.
[03:14.360 --> 03:17.440]  And with that, we're doing a number of different seed trials
[03:17.440 --> 03:21.540]  and putting different research programs together
[03:21.540 --> 03:23.540]  to support the industry's growth.
[03:23.540 --> 03:25.100]  And so I'm happy to talk more
[03:25.100 --> 03:26.860]  about what we're doing specific,
[03:26.860 --> 03:28.660]  but I really wanted to kind of just go over
[03:28.660 --> 03:31.440]  what we're seeing as far as the industry trends.
[03:32.300 --> 03:34.540]  So here's a cool little graphic,
[03:34.540 --> 03:37.180]  just kind of explaining what anticipation is
[03:37.180 --> 03:39.000]  for the industry,
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.240]  getting away from so much of the cannabinoid production
[03:42.240 --> 03:44.340]  or small-scale seed production,
[03:44.340 --> 03:47.220]  really moving into a growth in the fiber market
[03:47.220 --> 03:51.360]  with an expectation of 18.6 billion by 2017.
[03:52.620 --> 03:54.900]  This is pretty good overview.
[03:54.900 --> 03:57.340]  It's kind of funny as I started this presentation
[03:57.340 --> 04:00.140]  and put it together a couple of months ago
[04:00.140 --> 04:01.500]  or started talking about it,
[04:01.500 --> 04:03.580]  it's amazing the topics that have come up
[04:03.580 --> 04:05.280]  just naturally amongst our groups.
[04:05.280 --> 04:07.180]  And so I really leaned into
[04:07.180 --> 04:10.320]  Global Hemp Association's advisory team.
[04:10.320 --> 04:12.620]  We've built a team around all different aspects
[04:12.620 --> 04:14.540]  in the industry and leaned on them
[04:14.540 --> 04:17.020]  about our global trends and what we're seeing.
[04:17.780 --> 04:18.620]  And so this is not just feedback
[04:18.620 --> 04:20.180]  from what I've seen specifically,
[04:20.180 --> 04:22.600]  but definitely leaned into our teams.
[04:23.640 --> 04:26.780]  In North America, the growth of the herd market
[04:26.780 --> 04:28.900]  has really been booming,
[04:28.900 --> 04:31.460]  really focused on animal bedding and hempcrete.
[04:32.360 --> 04:34.540]  For those, I'm not sure who's on the call,
[04:34.540 --> 04:38.180]  but herd is the woody core within the hemp stock
[04:38.180 --> 04:40.040]  and that's really taken off.
[04:40.040 --> 04:43.440]  And really I lay that or put a lot of contribution for that
[04:43.440 --> 04:45.940]  to the processing that we have available
[04:45.940 --> 04:48.020]  within the industry and where that sits
[04:48.020 --> 04:51.780]  as far as the quality of processing that's needed.
[04:51.780 --> 04:55.740]  The price itself has increased at 75% over the last year
[04:55.740 --> 04:59.780]  and really due to the shipping costs from China and Europe.
[04:59.780 --> 05:02.060]  It's been very exorbitant.
[05:02.060 --> 05:06.260]  Hemp bast or the fiber is really being used for insulation
[05:06.260 --> 05:08.340]  and to replace fiberglass.
[05:08.340 --> 05:10.020]  That market's growing very quickly
[05:10.020 --> 05:11.380]  both in the automotive industry
[05:11.380 --> 05:13.260]  as well as the building industry.
[05:13.260 --> 05:17.500]  This substitutes for biocomposites and insulation.
[05:17.500 --> 05:21.300]  Fiber markets have also learned the hard way.
[05:21.300 --> 05:23.620]  There's a lot of fiber being grown right now
[05:23.620 --> 05:27.440]  and a lot of our herd producers or processing facilities
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.740]  are starting to see a backup of fiber
[05:31.740 --> 05:34.340]  that is not able to be moved into the market
[05:34.340 --> 05:36.860]  due to the poor quality of fiber.
[05:36.860 --> 05:38.340]  And so we're really realizing
[05:38.340 --> 05:40.280]  that no matter what the cost is,
[05:40.280 --> 05:42.420]  our big markets are not going to open up
[05:42.420 --> 05:44.860]  and they're not able to come in and purchase
[05:44.860 --> 05:48.580]  until we get a consistent quality for inputs.
[05:48.580 --> 05:52.460]  And so we're seeing a lot of backed up unusable fiber
[05:52.460 --> 05:54.020]  that's gonna need to be processed.
[05:54.020 --> 05:56.380]  And so we're processed again
[05:56.380 --> 05:59.100]  and it's that second and third phase of processing
[05:59.100 --> 06:01.140]  that we're still struggling to see
[06:01.140 --> 06:03.060]  especially here in the United States.
[06:03.060 --> 06:05.460]  Biocomposite pellets and biocomposite products
[06:05.460 --> 06:08.360]  are evolving slowly but carefully.
[06:08.360 --> 06:11.180]  There's really a dynamic opportunity.
[06:11.180 --> 06:12.740]  The dynamics and the opportunities
[06:12.740 --> 06:14.100]  are becoming better understood
[06:14.100 --> 06:16.620]  by processors and distributors,
[06:16.620 --> 06:20.860]  which is really, I think, a unique situation that we have.
[06:20.860 --> 06:23.560]  When we talk about market demand,
[06:23.560 --> 06:26.060]  we're starting to see consumers are understanding
[06:26.060 --> 06:29.420]  the value of these more sustainable products.
[06:29.420 --> 06:31.600]  And so we're starting to see a much bigger drive.
[06:31.600 --> 06:33.080]  The economics of the hemp crop
[06:33.080 --> 06:34.920]  are also becoming better understood
[06:34.920 --> 06:37.220]  with a lot of research being done.
[06:37.220 --> 06:39.620]  And I'll talk a little bit more about what I'm seeing
[06:39.620 --> 06:43.780]  later on as far as the research that's being conducted.
[06:43.780 --> 06:47.420]  And the focus in industry has really shifted
[06:47.420 --> 06:50.340]  to those data points and less around
[06:50.340 --> 06:51.580]  being able to do it ourselves,
[06:51.580 --> 06:54.800]  but really recognizing the need for data for scalability.
[06:54.800 --> 06:56.280]  And then in North America,
[06:56.280 --> 07:00.060]  textile fibers are slowly evolving into the market,
[07:00.060 --> 07:02.340]  nowhere near as fast as it's been expected.
[07:02.340 --> 07:04.660]  Like I said, that secondary processing
[07:04.660 --> 07:07.720]  or carding and de-gumming is really something
[07:08.040 --> 07:10.520]  that the United States is lacking.
[07:10.520 --> 07:13.340]  We're lacking the equipment and or the,
[07:13.340 --> 07:16.080]  in China, we're seeing a lot of chemical use
[07:16.080 --> 07:18.680]  that we just don't have or hand processing
[07:18.680 --> 07:21.280]  that we just don't have and can't compete with here.
[07:22.240 --> 07:24.160]  So it'll just take a little bit longer to get there,
[07:24.160 --> 07:26.240]  but it's definitely a viable market.
[07:26.240 --> 07:28.300]  You see a lot of companies like Patagonia
[07:28.300 --> 07:32.080]  that just released an LCA on the hemp fiber
[07:32.080 --> 07:34.220]  that is proving much more sustainable
[07:34.220 --> 07:35.800]  than these other products.
[07:35.800 --> 07:39.120]  And because of that, obviously we're seeing large brands,
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  really get behind the value of the hemp in their materials.
[07:45.600 --> 07:48.460]  And then hemp fiber used to strengthen concrete
[07:48.460 --> 07:51.720]  and sequester CO2 is becoming a huge area of interest
[07:51.720 --> 07:52.640]  in our markets.
[07:54.920 --> 07:56.480]  Hemp really is at the forefront
[07:56.480 --> 07:58.040]  and I'll mention this again here in a minute,
[07:58.040 --> 07:59.720]  but hemp is really at the forefront
[07:59.720 --> 08:03.720]  to these conversations around sustainability and ESG scores.
[08:03.720 --> 08:05.740]  And so looking at the life cycle analysis
[08:06.580 --> 08:09.540]  and being able to lock up that carbon in the hemp crate
[08:09.540 --> 08:12.700]  for or in the concrete for a hundred plus years
[08:12.700 --> 08:17.580]  becomes a very valuable carbon credit as this,
[08:17.580 --> 08:22.060]  the greenhouse gases and addressing the carbon sequestration,
[08:22.060 --> 08:23.500]  hemp is more and more at the forefront
[08:23.500 --> 08:25.060]  of those conversations.
[08:25.060 --> 08:27.540]  And then many new products are evolving
[08:27.540 --> 08:29.860]  into the marketplace, such as reinforced rods
[08:29.860 --> 08:32.660]  and concrete made from vast fibers.
[08:32.660 --> 08:35.440]  Still, there's a lot of R and D that needs to go into this,
[08:36.140 --> 08:38.040]  but proving to be stronger than steel.
[08:39.200 --> 08:42.480]  And then of course, adding that extra value on top,
[08:43.440 --> 08:46.840]  when we talk about the carbon avoidance and sequestration.
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.520]  So to date, feed ingredients, hemp feed ingredients,
[08:50.520 --> 08:53.040]  the market is not improved yet by the Association
[08:53.040 --> 08:56.760]  of American Feed Control Officials or AFCO
[08:56.760 --> 09:00.600]  and FDA or in the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine.
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.280]  So in Montana has really let the charge on our hemp feed
[09:06.120 --> 09:08.560]  and markets for grain and feed.
[09:08.560 --> 09:11.400]  And so this is an area where Global Hemp Association,
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.160]  like I said, we've really focused on the fiber aspect
[09:15.160 --> 09:18.360]  and really lent to collaborating with organizations
[09:18.360 --> 09:20.100]  like Hemp Feed Coalition.
[09:20.100 --> 09:23.720]  But in 2021, the governor of Montana signed in a bill
[09:23.720 --> 09:25.700]  that authorized hemp food ingredients
[09:25.700 --> 09:27.520]  for commercial animal feed.
[09:27.520 --> 09:30.080]  And then they've worked diligently
[09:30.080 --> 09:33.240]  with the Hemp Feed Coalition and led by IND Hemp,
[09:33.240 --> 09:35.560]  that charge is really led by IND Hemp
[09:35.560 --> 09:39.340]  to bring hemp animal feed into the market,
[09:39.340 --> 09:41.840]  which will really open up that grain market
[09:41.840 --> 09:44.260]  that is really stifled right now
[09:44.260 --> 09:47.000]  by a lack of end users or ability to feed.
[09:48.040 --> 09:49.640]  And then, like I said earlier,
[09:49.640 --> 09:53.400]  hemp is really at the forefront when we talk about,
[09:53.400 --> 09:56.720]  what is this value and where do we see the market going?
[09:56.720 --> 09:59.240]  Hemp is at the forefront of these conversations
[09:59.240 --> 10:01.560]  around sustainability and carbon.
[10:01.960 --> 10:04.440]  And it's so much more than,
[10:04.440 --> 10:06.240]  even the material that we're making,
[10:06.240 --> 10:11.240]  but the entire process at which it's being manufactured
[10:11.440 --> 10:13.480]  is more and more sustainable
[10:13.480 --> 10:16.760]  or is being considered to be more and more sustainable.
[10:16.760 --> 10:19.360]  People within the industry are really focusing on it.
[10:20.520 --> 10:23.020]  And then a complex regulatory environment
[10:23.020 --> 10:25.640]  for production of sales for cannabis products
[10:25.640 --> 10:29.800]  and additional layers of difficulty in projecting,
[10:30.240 --> 10:33.040]  domestic markets demand, the market demand,
[10:33.040 --> 10:36.640]  and expected levels of production.
[10:36.640 --> 10:38.440]  Wow, I'm struggling on this one.
[10:38.440 --> 10:41.280]  For those producers interested in exporting cannabis
[10:41.280 --> 10:44.080]  into foreign markets, the difficulties are amplified.
[10:44.080 --> 10:48.120]  So again, as far as like the overall global market,
[10:48.120 --> 10:50.840]  the legislation and policy or lack thereof
[10:50.840 --> 10:53.920]  around the cannabinoids and health and wellness products
[10:53.920 --> 10:55.480]  is really stifling the market
[10:55.480 --> 10:58.200]  for especially international trade.
[10:58.200 --> 11:00.240]  And then we talk about research trends,
[11:00.240 --> 11:02.300]  kind of like I mentioned previously.
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.240]  I'm seeing a ton of focus in the industry
[11:07.240 --> 11:09.880]  on this need for true data.
[11:09.880 --> 11:12.600]  Now, and there's a big difference that we've noticed
[11:12.600 --> 11:15.940]  in farm trials that are conducted by farms
[11:15.940 --> 11:17.880]  and research trials, you know,
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.300]  and when the data is collected, both very valuable,
[11:21.300 --> 11:24.040]  but both very, you know, very critical, I guess,
[11:24.040 --> 11:25.080]  to be done correctly.
[11:25.080 --> 11:26.640]  And so the value that we're seeing
[11:26.640 --> 11:27.920]  or what we're starting to see a lot
[11:28.600 --> 11:30.240]  is this need for scalability
[11:30.240 --> 11:32.360]  and the need for scalable data.
[11:32.360 --> 11:35.620]  And so making sure that data is collected correctly.
[11:35.620 --> 11:36.880]  And therefore, you know,
[11:36.880 --> 11:39.760]  the government is really getting behind funds
[11:39.760 --> 11:43.440]  or making funds available for research
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.160]  and infrastructure builds so that we can better understand
[11:47.160 --> 11:49.440]  and scale our industry.
[11:49.440 --> 11:51.240]  And so I just made a few comments here.
[11:51.240 --> 11:54.760]  Last year, there were two pretty good sized grants
[11:54.760 --> 11:58.560]  given out, one for Global Hemp Innovation Center
[11:58.560 --> 12:00.440]  and one down in the Kentucky area.
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.720]  And I'm not positive who's part of that conglomerate.
[12:04.720 --> 12:08.120]  Are you guys, I don't know if Cornell is part of it.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.040]  You are, okay.
[12:10.040 --> 12:13.220]  Anyways, yeah, so great opportunities here to research
[12:13.220 --> 12:14.200]  and study the plant.
[12:14.200 --> 12:15.800]  And then just recently,
[12:17.260 --> 12:20.240]  Secretary Villesac announced on February 7th,
[12:20.240 --> 12:25.240]  the $1 billion partnership for Climate Smart Commodities
[12:25.800 --> 12:27.560]  and for expanding markets.
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.160]  And during his presentation,
[12:29.160 --> 12:32.400]  specifically called out hemp multiple times
[12:32.400 --> 12:35.320]  for the Climate Smart Commodities.
[12:35.320 --> 12:37.580]  And so, and again, for providing
[12:37.580 --> 12:39.840]  that additional rotation crop or additional crop
[12:39.840 --> 12:42.640]  to our rural farmers and supporting rural communities.
[12:42.640 --> 12:45.080]  So it really is at the forefront.
[12:45.080 --> 12:47.680]  This is just a most recent, a couple of recent,
[12:48.520 --> 12:50.880]  I guess, images that I just put out here.
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.880]  One is from the USDA survey that they just published
[12:56.280 --> 12:58.200]  about acres that are being grown.
[12:58.200 --> 13:00.480]  It's really interesting when I look at this graph,
[13:00.480 --> 13:02.560]  it looks like our industry is doing really well.
[13:02.560 --> 13:05.600]  And then there was another graph I was gonna put on here
[13:05.600 --> 13:07.800]  or another image that I was gonna put on here
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.120]  that shows acres or states that are actually growing
[13:12.120 --> 13:15.360]  for fiber and it's such a small, small market.
[13:15.360 --> 13:17.520]  And so with that, I wanted to show,
[13:18.320 --> 13:21.560]  we've got a lot of hemp production that is happening on,
[13:21.560 --> 13:23.640]  and when I say a lot, it's significantly less
[13:23.640 --> 13:25.600]  as you can see on the graph.
[13:25.600 --> 13:28.760]  The other graph here compared to what we saw in 2019
[13:28.760 --> 13:31.560]  and 2020 for projected growth.
[13:32.520 --> 13:37.520]  But with that, I wanna add here on the other image,
[13:37.520 --> 13:39.840]  you can see the number of, in blue,
[13:39.840 --> 13:43.300]  or the number of licenses that were issued to grow hemp.
[13:43.300 --> 13:46.080]  And then the orange line is the number of acres
[13:46.080 --> 13:48.400]  that were actually grown for hemp
[13:48.400 --> 13:50.560]  or reported to have been grown.
[13:50.560 --> 13:54.880]  And we're expected this to scale significantly.
[13:54.880 --> 13:58.000]  Same group, Whitney Economics, Bo Whitney,
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.400]  has done an incredible job
[13:59.400 --> 14:01.520]  at the economic side of this industry.
[14:01.520 --> 14:06.520]  And he's projecting 10 million acres by 2030.
[14:06.520 --> 14:10.280]  And so, or at least the demand that's needed, right?
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.400]  And of course, there's obviously concern
[14:12.400 --> 14:14.640]  about how we're going to scale,
[14:14.640 --> 14:17.960]  where, seed production and so forth.
[14:17.960 --> 14:22.000]  But it's definitely, that the demand for the material
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.380]  is definitely becoming more and more obvious
[14:25.380 --> 14:28.300]  and relevant with COVID and now war
[14:28.300 --> 14:31.100]  and supply chain issues and transportation issues.
[14:31.100 --> 14:33.680]  So as far as globally, I kind of wanted to touch
[14:33.680 --> 14:36.020]  on a couple of different areas across the globe
[14:36.020 --> 14:37.680]  and what we're seeing.
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.960]  At present, Europe cultivates an estimated 25%
[14:42.480 --> 14:44.960]  of the world's hemp, mainly in France,
[14:44.960 --> 14:48.080]  followed by the Netherlands, Romania.
[14:48.080 --> 14:50.960]  In total, at least 20 countries cultivate hemp
[14:50.960 --> 14:53.640]  in the European continent.
[14:53.640 --> 14:56.080]  And so, they've done a great job.
[14:56.080 --> 14:58.360]  We've got a number of members that do fabulous,
[14:58.360 --> 14:59.960]  especially at their seed production.
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.040]  They've had years to work on this.
[15:03.040 --> 15:05.760]  A lot of equipment has come over from,
[15:05.760 --> 15:08.260]  or into the US has come over from Europe.
[15:09.220 --> 15:11.700]  But reality is, is their acreage
[15:11.700 --> 15:14.980]  at which they'll be able to supply seeds for us long-term
[15:14.980 --> 15:17.580]  is significantly smaller compared to our demand.
[15:17.580 --> 15:21.060]  And so, we've really got to be able to stabilize
[15:21.060 --> 15:24.640]  our production and our seed cultivation.
[15:25.700 --> 15:29.260]  China remains the world's largest hemp producer for fiber.
[15:30.380 --> 15:31.780]  They've done a great job.
[15:31.780 --> 15:33.220]  Most of our textile fiber,
[15:33.220 --> 15:34.700]  pretty much all of our textile fiber
[15:34.700 --> 15:36.940]  comes from there and or India.
[15:36.940 --> 15:40.940]  But China is definitely leading on textile production.
[15:40.940 --> 15:42.860]  They still have illegal,
[15:42.860 --> 15:45.020]  hemp is still, for CBD production,
[15:45.020 --> 15:47.260]  is illegal in the majority of their country.
[15:47.260 --> 15:49.020]  But years ago, they legalized it
[15:49.020 --> 15:50.820]  and put government funds behind it
[15:50.820 --> 15:53.580]  for its antimicrobial factor in textiles.
[15:54.460 --> 15:55.980]  India loosened restrictions
[15:55.980 --> 15:58.220]  on hemp-based productions in 2021,
[15:58.220 --> 16:01.340]  allowing hemp seed, hemp seed oil, hemp seed flour,
[16:01.340 --> 16:05.240]  and introduced as general ingredients to food products.
[16:05.240 --> 16:08.160]  Japanese regulations remain highly restrictive
[16:08.160 --> 16:11.060]  with regards to cannabis and CBD industry
[16:11.060 --> 16:14.560]  is wholly driven by and supported by CBD.
[16:15.400 --> 16:18.200]  Columbia continues to be the leader in Latin America.
[16:18.200 --> 16:19.200]  It's kind of interesting.
[16:19.200 --> 16:22.360]  There's a number of members here that have really pushed
[16:22.360 --> 16:26.640]  and gotten involved down in Columbia, which is pretty cool.
[16:26.640 --> 16:29.800]  Regulations approved legislation reform in 2021
[16:29.800 --> 16:33.900]  and allows cultivators to export flour
[16:33.900 --> 16:36.340]  grown into the country, grown in the country.
[16:36.340 --> 16:38.740]  Canada is of the biggest importer
[16:38.740 --> 16:41.220]  for Colombian hemp in the world.
[16:41.220 --> 16:44.020]  So I think that that's a pretty fascinating statistic
[16:44.020 --> 16:46.180]  when you look at international trade.
[16:46.180 --> 16:50.420]  Argentina, Chile, and Brazil are reformed regulators
[16:50.420 --> 16:53.300]  in all reformed regulations in 2021
[16:53.300 --> 16:56.540]  to allow a more favorable flow of cannabis products
[16:56.540 --> 16:57.560]  into their borders.
[16:58.740 --> 16:59.960]  None of these three countries
[16:59.960 --> 17:01.900]  currently have agricultural programs
[17:01.900 --> 17:03.900]  allowing for hemp to be cultivated,
[17:03.900 --> 17:07.720]  but have patient focused medical programs.
[17:08.700 --> 17:10.660]  One thing that we are definitely starting to see,
[17:10.660 --> 17:14.100]  especially as genetics are starting to become more stabilized
[17:14.100 --> 17:17.660]  and really evaluated are the, you know,
[17:17.660 --> 17:19.940]  the programs are definitely opening up
[17:19.940 --> 17:24.340]  for big agriculture and outdoor cultivation.
[17:24.340 --> 17:26.180]  And then African countries,
[17:26.180 --> 17:28.820]  it's mind boggling to me how much I hear
[17:28.820 --> 17:32.580]  about both financial transfer and support
[17:32.580 --> 17:35.700]  into the African countries, as well as the cultivation for,
[17:35.700 --> 17:38.540]  or as well as the big agriculture support,
[17:38.540 --> 17:41.260]  even as much as bringing, you know, irrigation water
[17:41.260 --> 17:45.460]  or pivot, you know, pivot lines into Africa.
[17:45.460 --> 17:47.820]  So numerous international companies
[17:47.820 --> 17:49.940]  have successfully applied for licenses
[17:49.940 --> 17:52.100]  in Zimbabwe in 2021.
[17:52.100 --> 17:55.080]  And we expect government support that is being committed
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.180]  to the hemp program will continue to keep Zimbabwe
[17:58.540 --> 18:00.780]  as a leader of the African cannabis markets.
[18:02.980 --> 18:04.660]  And then that's pretty much it.
[18:04.660 --> 18:05.940]  I'll open it up for questions.
[18:05.940 --> 18:10.260]  If you have questions or anything like that,
[18:10.260 --> 18:12.180]  a touch back on Global Hemp Association,
[18:12.180 --> 18:15.160]  we host 18, eight to 20 meetings a month
[18:15.160 --> 18:19.140]  that are similar to this, where we offer questions.
[18:19.140 --> 18:20.060]  I work with Daniela.
[18:20.060 --> 18:21.780]  She's been on a number of different times
[18:21.780 --> 18:23.780]  and some other staff from Cornell,
[18:23.780 --> 18:26.900]  but I invite you guys to check out our YouTube page
[18:26.900 --> 18:30.980]  or listen to any of our 400 posted interviews
[18:30.980 --> 18:33.260]  with different executives on our YouTube
[18:33.260 --> 18:35.940]  or any of our podcast channels.
[18:35.940 --> 18:37.740]  So that's about it.
[18:39.580 --> 18:40.820]  Marie, do you have any questions
[18:40.820 --> 18:43.020]  or does anybody else have anything that they'd?
[18:44.980 --> 18:48.620]  You said about Montana and the grain.
[18:48.620 --> 18:52.700]  So their governor said that, you know, they could use grain.
[18:52.700 --> 18:55.500]  However, if they feed it to animals,
[18:55.500 --> 18:58.660]  don't they run the risk of that animal product,
[18:58.660 --> 19:03.180]  milk, meat, whatever, being rejected by other states?
[19:03.180 --> 19:05.100]  Yeah, so they can't sell it on.
[19:05.100 --> 19:08.820]  It can be sold into their own cattle or animal,
[19:08.820 --> 19:11.000]  but it cannot be sold across state lines
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.820]  into commercial production.
[19:12.820 --> 19:15.020]  Yeah, not yet.
[19:15.020 --> 19:15.860]  So that is-
[19:15.860 --> 19:16.700]  That's right, not yet.
[19:16.700 --> 19:17.520]  Sometimes it does take,
[19:17.520 --> 19:20.180]  but I just wanted people listening to know that like,
[19:20.180 --> 19:25.180]  you know, interstate differences are on the table.
[19:25.500 --> 19:27.620]  Often the, you know, a problem.
[19:28.580 --> 19:32.940]  Yeah, I would say that that's been the biggest heartache,
[19:32.940 --> 19:34.460]  especially as you see the studies
[19:34.460 --> 19:36.420]  that have come out on animal production.
[19:36.420 --> 19:38.500]  I saw one that was just released today
[19:38.500 --> 19:42.760]  from the National Hemp Association about eggs
[19:42.760 --> 19:46.740]  and the omega-3s and the omegas that they're seeing in eggs
[19:46.740 --> 19:51.260]  because the chickens have been fed hemp, yeah, hemp feed.
[19:51.260 --> 19:52.100]  Yeah.
[19:52.100 --> 19:53.220]  I asked this yesterday.
[19:53.220 --> 19:58.220]  So what does, you know, Canada certainly, you know,
[19:58.340 --> 20:00.740]  we buy a lot of, for human consumption,
[20:00.740 --> 20:04.580]  a lot of our grain, hemp seed comes from Canada.
[20:04.580 --> 20:08.260]  What do they do in terms of testing and some other things
[20:08.260 --> 20:11.340]  to, can't we just follow along with some of that?
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.260]  Yeah, and I think that they have,
[20:14.260 --> 20:16.900]  what we're seeing now is they want to understand
[20:16.900 --> 20:18.880]  what that buildup is, right?
[20:18.880 --> 20:21.260]  After we've consumed so much of it,
[20:21.260 --> 20:22.620]  what is the buildup for us?
[20:23.020 --> 20:24.900]  And then what is the buildup for our animals?
[20:24.900 --> 20:26.700]  And so I know that takes time.
[20:26.700 --> 20:28.780]  And the studies that are required
[20:28.780 --> 20:30.720]  are hundreds and thousands of dollars.
[20:30.720 --> 20:33.580]  And so, you know, raising enough capital
[20:33.580 --> 20:36.700]  and then IND hemp has really funded a lot of that.
[20:36.700 --> 20:39.780]  So I think matter of time.
[20:43.460 --> 20:45.340]  Yeah, any other questions for anybody?
[20:45.340 --> 20:49.500]  I don't know where anybody is at as far as in the industry.
[20:49.500 --> 20:52.280]  I recognize a couple of faces or a couple of names.
[20:53.620 --> 20:55.380]  Mandy, this is Janice Degney.
[20:55.380 --> 20:56.940]  I'm one of the co-hosts today.
[20:57.980 --> 21:00.500]  I work with Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[21:00.500 --> 21:04.100]  I'm curious about the insulation panels.
[21:04.100 --> 21:04.940]  Yeah.
[21:04.940 --> 21:06.040]  Can I contact you offline?
[21:06.040 --> 21:10.140]  Can you give me a potential businesses to contact?
[21:10.140 --> 21:11.220]  Absolutely.
[21:11.220 --> 21:13.340]  And I'll give a shout out to one
[21:13.340 --> 21:14.820]  that's really leading the charge.
[21:14.820 --> 21:17.320]  They did an incredible job on a recent crowd fund,
[21:17.320 --> 21:20.200]  raised a few million dollars in a week or so.
[21:20.240 --> 21:24.360]  A Hempatexture, they're out, Maddie Mead is in Idaho.
[21:24.360 --> 21:28.440]  He's building a hemp insulation or doing hemp insulation
[21:28.440 --> 21:32.200]  with a bat wool, like a wool insulation.
[21:32.200 --> 21:35.880]  And he actually started in Hempcrete
[21:35.880 --> 21:38.860]  and now has shifted over to the insulation,
[21:39.680 --> 21:41.680]  but they've got a pretty good facility going in.
[21:41.680 --> 21:43.480]  I think they broke ground last month
[21:43.480 --> 21:45.880]  and have partnered with IND Hemp on supply.
[21:45.880 --> 21:48.460]  So we've got a good supply going.
[21:50.720 --> 21:52.480]  And then if you're looking at the international,
[21:52.480 --> 21:54.720]  we've got about a handful of those as well.
[21:56.080 --> 21:57.000]  Thank you.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[22:01.430 --> 22:04.230]  I have two loaded questions.
[22:04.230 --> 22:05.070]  I like it.
[22:06.670 --> 22:08.830]  Okay, so the first one is,
[22:11.030 --> 22:15.510]  how do you think if you were to create a roadmap
[22:16.550 --> 22:21.550]  for the US to become the leader in hemp production
[22:22.070 --> 22:25.990]  and processing in the world, how would that be?
[22:25.990 --> 22:27.590]  That's my first question.
[22:27.590 --> 22:31.150]  And then my second question is,
[22:31.150 --> 22:35.150]  where are you going short-term and long-term
[22:35.150 --> 22:36.750]  with the Global Hemp Association?
[22:36.750 --> 22:39.390]  What are your next steps, your goals,
[22:39.390 --> 22:43.390]  and where would you wanna be in five years?
[22:44.270 --> 22:47.130]  Okay, roadmap is a loaded question.
[22:48.350 --> 22:50.430]  And I'll be honest, I think that there's some
[22:50.430 --> 22:53.750]  that I'm not sure I personally know,
[22:53.750 --> 22:55.630]  but definitely collaboration.
[22:55.630 --> 22:58.870]  We see big brands are not willing or able to come on
[22:58.870 --> 23:03.870]  until we have a more secure supply of input
[23:03.870 --> 23:05.430]  that is diverse, right?
[23:05.430 --> 23:07.670]  That we can pull from different territories.
[23:07.670 --> 23:11.470]  I definitely see, if we're talking about seed or production,
[23:11.470 --> 23:14.430]  the Northern states have done a really good job
[23:14.430 --> 23:16.190]  at grain production.
[23:16.190 --> 23:19.790]  The Heartland, the Midwest is going to do really well
[23:20.110 --> 23:22.870]  with the automotive industry and volume of production
[23:22.870 --> 23:26.250]  because as we move into a rotation crop
[23:26.250 --> 23:28.270]  or adding it as a rotation crop,
[23:29.830 --> 23:31.270]  we're gonna see bigger volume.
[23:31.270 --> 23:33.510]  I think the oil or energy sector
[23:33.510 --> 23:36.510]  and the automotive industry,
[23:36.510 --> 23:38.710]  I think that we have to keep in mind
[23:38.710 --> 23:40.750]  that our facilities are going to be close
[23:40.750 --> 23:45.710]  to where our end manufacturers are for cost of the fiber,
[23:45.710 --> 23:47.070]  cost of transportation.
[23:48.070 --> 23:49.830]  Is that answering your question?
[23:49.830 --> 23:50.670]  Do you have any others?
[23:50.670 --> 23:53.150]  Like what specifically about the roadmap?
[23:55.590 --> 24:00.590]  I'm just curious about how do we take the business
[24:01.030 --> 24:03.590]  from these other countries and get it ourselves?
[24:03.590 --> 24:08.310]  Like what is it that we need to do?
[24:08.310 --> 24:10.870]  And also I'm thinking also about,
[24:10.870 --> 24:12.830]  like my priorities for my job,
[24:12.830 --> 24:16.950]  like what is it that I need to focus on
[24:17.790 --> 24:19.070]  so that we have the business here
[24:19.070 --> 24:22.350]  and not elsewhere internationally?
[24:24.790 --> 24:26.430]  I'll be honest, when we talk about states,
[24:26.430 --> 24:28.470]  states have done a really good job at figuring out
[24:28.470 --> 24:31.150]  what's gonna grow well in their state potentially.
[24:31.150 --> 24:32.710]  There's some that are a little bit different,
[24:32.710 --> 24:34.390]  especially in our lower states,
[24:34.390 --> 24:36.510]  but on a nationwide scale,
[24:36.510 --> 24:39.630]  trying to really bring together existing data
[24:39.630 --> 24:43.750]  so that we understand what is sustainable.
[24:43.750 --> 24:46.150]  We as an association immediately are focusing
[24:46.150 --> 24:48.630]  on national seed trials with a goal
[24:48.630 --> 24:50.870]  of creating scalable data,
[24:50.870 --> 24:54.470]  so that we can hit multiple areas across the country.
[24:54.470 --> 24:57.030]  However, for New York, understanding,
[24:57.870 --> 24:59.350]  well, let me back up for a second.
[24:59.350 --> 25:00.870]  There's another piece to this.
[25:00.870 --> 25:03.790]  The United States has to compete on labor costs
[25:03.790 --> 25:06.230]  that other countries don't have to compete on.
[25:06.230 --> 25:10.310]  And so being very serious about bringing in AI
[25:10.310 --> 25:13.430]  or robotics or technology that can help
[25:13.430 --> 25:17.710]  to solidify the consistency,
[25:17.710 --> 25:20.750]  provide a better consistent product for inputs
[25:20.750 --> 25:24.790]  as well as our outputs, increase our profit margins,
[25:24.790 --> 25:27.270]  make it so we don't have to compete with the labor costs.
[25:27.270 --> 25:31.350]  I think that that puts us on a much more even playing field
[25:31.350 --> 25:33.790]  with someone like China or India,
[25:33.790 --> 25:36.910]  or even in our Southern states,
[25:36.910 --> 25:39.990]  where say like Latin America,
[25:39.990 --> 25:43.470]  where labor cost is just not as much of a concern
[25:43.470 --> 25:45.390]  as it is here in the United States.
[25:45.390 --> 25:49.870]  And so I definitely think AI or technology
[25:49.870 --> 25:54.870]  has to be added into some less typical industries
[25:58.670 --> 26:02.310]  like manufacturing and or farm and agriculture.
[26:04.230 --> 26:06.390]  Marie, oh, let me ask one, answer one more question
[26:06.390 --> 26:09.470]  about the long-term goals of GHA.
[26:09.950 --> 26:12.270]  Initially, we're really focused on our research
[26:12.270 --> 26:14.350]  and building a research arm,
[26:14.350 --> 26:17.310]  really moving into being able to understand
[26:17.310 --> 26:21.950]  how product is processed, what the value of the product is,
[26:21.950 --> 26:26.350]  and then moving it into end products or in manufacturing.
[26:26.350 --> 26:29.390]  We have a lot of products that are being manufactured.
[26:29.390 --> 26:31.830]  When I say a lot, say a hundred different products,
[26:31.830 --> 26:34.590]  but if they said 20 to 25,000
[26:34.590 --> 26:38.070]  or even 50,000 products can be made from hemp,
[26:38.110 --> 26:41.710]  we start seeing a major impact or opportunity for IP
[26:41.710 --> 26:45.590]  and for new development that just isn't understood.
[26:45.590 --> 26:47.550]  So in the next few years,
[26:47.550 --> 26:50.430]  really focusing on building consumer demand
[26:50.430 --> 26:52.990]  and creating or helping to participate
[26:52.990 --> 26:56.310]  in that standard development or grading process
[26:56.310 --> 27:00.390]  so that we can have a better consistent input
[27:00.390 --> 27:02.430]  at our manufacturing.
[27:03.430 --> 27:06.430]  So I'm gonna ask about the organization.
[27:06.430 --> 27:11.430]  I tried on a blog to have sort of like a matchmaking thing.
[27:12.830 --> 27:17.190]  So whether you wanna buy product, sell product,
[27:17.190 --> 27:21.230]  even look for a job, hire someone in the industry, whatever.
[27:21.230 --> 27:24.230]  And it was just like a little too small geographically.
[27:24.230 --> 27:25.950]  Do you guys have anything like that?
[27:25.950 --> 27:30.310]  Like a matchmaking kind of place for that?
[27:30.590 --> 27:33.190]  Place for that to happen?
[27:33.190 --> 27:36.310]  I mean, other than what goes on in your personal head
[27:36.310 --> 27:40.670]  about who's doing what, where, who needs what?
[27:40.670 --> 27:43.510]  Is there a way folks can find?
[27:43.510 --> 27:45.550]  Aha, ha ha.
[27:45.550 --> 27:46.910]  I'm so glad you asked.
[27:46.910 --> 27:48.990]  And that wasn't even prompted.
[27:48.990 --> 27:51.070]  So as part of the association,
[27:53.150 --> 27:57.270]  the whole reason I did this is I attended an event one time
[27:57.270 --> 27:58.590]  and over and over again,
[27:58.590 --> 28:00.870]  I heard people making the exact same mistakes.
[28:00.870 --> 28:05.870]  I was holding an extraction, some crude basically,
[28:06.310 --> 28:11.150]  slurry that was extracted with a water-based technology
[28:11.150 --> 28:14.990]  or solution and costing pennies on the dollar.
[28:14.990 --> 28:16.110]  And over and over again,
[28:16.110 --> 28:18.110]  I saw people making the same mistake
[28:18.110 --> 28:20.070]  with extraction technology.
[28:20.070 --> 28:21.710]  And there was nowhere for them to go
[28:21.710 --> 28:24.630]  and find who's in my area, who do I know?
[28:24.630 --> 28:26.710]  And so as part of the association,
[28:26.710 --> 28:29.950]  I wanted to build a platform with outside of me
[28:29.950 --> 28:31.630]  or outside of anybody on our team,
[28:31.630 --> 28:34.590]  you could log in and find out who's processing,
[28:34.590 --> 28:37.750]  who's in your territory, what are they doing?
[28:37.750 --> 28:39.470]  What are their focuses?
[28:39.470 --> 28:42.670]  I've interviewed now 480 executives
[28:42.670 --> 28:44.870]  and published them all on this platform.
[28:44.870 --> 28:46.630]  And so this is our hemp hallway.
[28:46.630 --> 28:47.990]  I branded it as the hallway
[28:47.990 --> 28:50.470]  so all organizations can come together,
[28:50.470 --> 28:53.030]  log into the platform and make connections.
[28:53.030 --> 28:57.030]  And then, so this kind of works like a typical feed.
[28:57.030 --> 28:59.870]  I go live, this is connected to our Facebook page.
[28:59.870 --> 29:02.510]  We post different articles or things that we share.
[29:02.510 --> 29:04.150]  Here's upcoming events.
[29:04.150 --> 29:07.230]  You can get on and actually make posts as well.
[29:07.230 --> 29:09.230]  But then I've actually put everybody
[29:09.230 --> 29:11.630]  that's logged into the platform on a map.
[29:11.630 --> 29:15.150]  And so I can search within a territory or a state
[29:15.150 --> 29:19.110]  and kind of see who else in my state is registered.
[29:19.110 --> 29:20.150]  What do they do?
[29:20.150 --> 29:21.390]  Are they processing?
[29:21.390 --> 29:25.230]  Are they in different texts, say in a textiles industry?
[29:25.230 --> 29:27.830]  And then same with different opportunities.
[29:27.830 --> 29:30.150]  I could post if I'm looking for a job.
[29:30.150 --> 29:31.950]  It looks like somebody just recently posts
[29:31.950 --> 29:35.430]  looking for a strategic or looking to be hired.
[29:37.230 --> 29:40.710]  Then in our media center, I publish all of our interviews
[29:40.710 --> 29:42.670]  and then also on our YouTube channel.
[29:42.670 --> 29:46.030]  So you can get in and search, say a carbon meeting.
[29:52.550 --> 29:54.310]  And you can see all of our carbon meetings
[29:54.310 --> 29:56.870]  that we've hosted in the last couple of months,
[29:58.070 --> 30:01.790]  as well as any articles that we may have published.
[30:04.350 --> 30:05.990]  And then opportunities.
[30:05.990 --> 30:07.710]  Oh, sorry, I did opportunities already.
[30:07.710 --> 30:08.550]  What was I looking at?
[30:08.550 --> 30:09.510]  Organizations.
[30:09.510 --> 30:11.670]  So these are all of our companies as well.
[30:11.670 --> 30:13.830]  And so you can do the same thing, get on here.
[30:13.830 --> 30:14.750]  These are all companies.
[30:14.750 --> 30:16.430]  And now remind you, these are all companies
[30:16.430 --> 30:18.510]  that have logged in or people that have set up
[30:18.510 --> 30:20.950]  their profiles on HempHallway.
[30:20.950 --> 30:25.950]  And so, yeah, it's created this network or community
[30:27.870 --> 30:32.110]  where outside of calling me or picking up the phone,
[30:32.110 --> 30:34.390]  you have a place to say who's who
[30:34.390 --> 30:36.390]  within the industry across the world.
[30:39.190 --> 30:42.750]  So yeah, and you can actually send messages and connect.
[30:42.750 --> 30:45.710]  So you can see here, Gina Ingalls logged on today.
[30:45.710 --> 30:48.790]  She's actually created an awesome hempcrete product
[30:48.790 --> 30:51.750]  or hempcrete block and just recently received
[30:51.750 --> 30:54.590]  a pretty good grant from the EPA.
[30:54.590 --> 30:56.310]  But now you can send her a message
[30:56.310 --> 30:58.710]  and connect with her directly from our platform.
[31:00.750 --> 31:03.990]  So yeah, I hope that that answers questions.
[31:05.630 --> 31:06.950]  Yes, thank you.
[31:06.950 --> 31:07.910]  Absolutely.
[31:12.070 --> 31:13.910]  Are there any other questions about trends
[31:13.910 --> 31:15.070]  or things we're seeing?
[31:15.070 --> 31:16.030]  And just so you know,
[31:16.030 --> 31:17.870]  please feel free to reach out to me at any time.
[31:17.910 --> 31:19.710]  We have a great team of people.
[31:20.630 --> 31:22.030]  I could show you to log on.
[31:22.030 --> 31:24.030]  I'll share our YouTube channel right here with you
[31:24.030 --> 31:25.750]  so that you have it,
[31:25.750 --> 31:28.390]  but feel free to log on there.
[31:28.390 --> 31:31.630]  Membership for us is fairly inexpensive for what we offer,
[31:31.630 --> 31:33.750]  but we're always looking for support
[31:33.750 --> 31:36.430]  so that we can do our national seed trials
[31:36.430 --> 31:39.870]  and really help provide scalable data.
[31:40.910 --> 31:43.030]  Just to touch back on why we're doing
[31:43.030 --> 31:45.630]  our national seed trials is over and over again,
[31:45.630 --> 31:48.470]  as we are building relationships with large brands,
[31:48.470 --> 31:50.750]  and I'll use Levi's as an example,
[31:51.790 --> 31:54.830]  they're currently purchasing from China.
[31:54.830 --> 31:57.150]  It's getting harder and harder to import
[31:57.150 --> 32:00.550]  or work with them for a number of different reasons.
[32:01.630 --> 32:03.790]  And so they're looking for a way
[32:03.790 --> 32:05.310]  to come over to the United States,
[32:05.310 --> 32:09.150]  but can't until they know that they can really hit scale
[32:09.150 --> 32:11.030]  for their inputs.
[32:11.030 --> 32:14.070]  And so our goal is to be able to provide
[32:14.070 --> 32:16.470]  that scalable data that then we can share
[32:16.470 --> 32:18.510]  with universities and individuals
[32:18.510 --> 32:22.230]  to more accurately make decisions
[32:22.230 --> 32:24.990]  about where processing is going and what we're doing.
[32:26.670 --> 32:27.510]  Yeah.
[32:29.830 --> 32:31.870]  I don't know if anybody else has anything.
[32:33.870 --> 32:38.870]  How do you see us at Cornell collaborating with you?
[32:40.630 --> 32:43.510]  How do you see us going,
[32:44.350 --> 32:46.630]  two way direction that benefits us?
[32:46.630 --> 32:47.710]  How do you see that?
[32:48.670 --> 32:49.630]  Oh, absolutely.
[32:53.060 --> 32:55.980]  I think the association has done a really good job
[32:55.980 --> 32:58.260]  at talking to the industry.
[32:58.260 --> 33:01.100]  Now I've really focused, when I approached this industry,
[33:01.100 --> 33:03.820]  I approached it from the people.
[33:03.820 --> 33:06.060]  The people are actually what drive my passion.
[33:06.060 --> 33:08.700]  I'm really passionate and I'm really good at connecting.
[33:08.700 --> 33:12.780]  And so I went after it and learned what the industry needs
[33:12.780 --> 33:16.140]  and then have a confident, I'm confident now,
[33:16.140 --> 33:19.380]  our team is confident now with a number of resources
[33:19.380 --> 33:21.580]  and our advisory board that we've built,
[33:21.580 --> 33:26.580]  that we can bring a funnel to an organization like Cornell
[33:26.940 --> 33:29.700]  so that we can then move products into market,
[33:29.700 --> 33:32.860]  provide accurate education and information,
[33:32.860 --> 33:36.660]  work together on grants to fund or bring people
[33:36.660 --> 33:39.580]  that are ready to the market,
[33:39.580 --> 33:41.900]  as well as collaboration on education.
[33:43.100 --> 33:44.860]  I host a number of these,
[33:44.860 --> 33:48.460]  I've had 7,000 people log into our meetings
[33:48.460 --> 33:49.980]  in the last six months.
[33:49.980 --> 33:53.900]  And so it's given us a good audience or network
[33:53.900 --> 33:57.260]  to be able to reach them both in person,
[33:57.260 --> 34:00.700]  as well as over digital platforms.
[34:00.700 --> 34:05.700]  And so being able to also co-share and collaborate on data.
[34:06.020 --> 34:08.700]  As we collect neutral data,
[34:08.700 --> 34:12.700]  I wanna make sure our data can withstand major peer review.
[34:13.460 --> 34:16.140]  And then in turn, being able to build on that data
[34:16.140 --> 34:22.980]  so we can save on resources and things like that.
[34:24.540 --> 34:25.500]  I feel like I'm in the hot seat.
[34:25.500 --> 34:27.460]  Usually you guys, this is flipped around
[34:27.460 --> 34:29.500]  and I'm the one asking all of the questions.
[34:29.500 --> 34:32.940]  And so, but yeah, I think all in all,
[34:32.940 --> 34:35.140]  when we talk about processing in the United States,
[34:35.140 --> 34:36.420]  there's major opportunity,
[34:36.420 --> 34:39.020]  lots of processing facilities are coming on board.
[34:40.180 --> 34:41.500]  It's gonna be a race to the bottom
[34:41.500 --> 34:42.820]  in the commodities market.
[34:42.820 --> 34:44.700]  And I know that those are processing right now
[34:44.700 --> 34:46.140]  and trying to keep price up.
[34:46.140 --> 34:50.740]  And so being aware as building facilities,
[34:50.740 --> 34:53.060]  what is that in market that we're after
[34:53.060 --> 34:57.780]  and how do we add that added value to the hemp stock
[34:57.780 --> 35:00.260]  so that it can be, so you're successful,
[35:00.260 --> 35:02.380]  so that you are sustainable.
[35:02.380 --> 35:05.220]  Because if we're processing and spending millions of dollars
[35:05.220 --> 35:08.100]  to sell into animal bedding long-term,
[35:08.100 --> 35:11.180]  eventually animal bedding will be that low hanging fruit
[35:11.180 --> 35:13.460]  for a high-end textile processor
[35:13.460 --> 35:17.100]  that's going to be producing major volume
[35:17.100 --> 35:18.740]  and then bottom out that market.
[35:18.740 --> 35:21.180]  And so keeping that in mind on that,
[35:23.380 --> 35:26.100]  as we start to grow, what is that tipping point?
[35:30.130 --> 35:32.130]  So yeah, Tim, do you have any questions?
[35:32.130 --> 35:33.010]  You have anything?
[35:35.490 --> 35:38.970]  I kind of came in late, so I don't,
[35:38.970 --> 35:41.050]  but that was very informative.
[35:42.290 --> 35:44.210]  I just wanted to stop.
[35:44.330 --> 35:46.250]  I'm on the hot seat, Mandy.
[35:46.250 --> 35:48.530]  I know, now I'm on the hot seat.
[35:52.890 --> 35:54.570]  Awesome, awesome, awesome.
[35:54.570 --> 35:55.410]  Yeah, I think we're-
[35:55.410 --> 35:57.050]  I wanna-
[35:57.050 --> 35:58.370]  Go ahead, Janice.
[35:58.370 --> 35:59.810]  I'm just watching the clock.
[35:59.810 --> 36:00.650]  Yeah, that's me too.
[36:00.650 --> 36:02.490]  I was gonna say, I wanna thank you for your presentation.
[36:02.490 --> 36:04.530]  That was great.
[36:04.530 --> 36:09.530]  So, but we do need to move on to our next speaker now.
[36:09.690 --> 36:10.530]  I love it.
[36:10.530 --> 36:11.370]  Well, thank you guys.
[36:11.370 --> 36:12.210]  It was wonderful.
[36:12.210 --> 36:13.690]  Like I said, if anybody needs anything,
[36:14.210 --> 36:15.370]  you look me up on YouTube and,
[36:15.370 --> 36:17.650]  or the Global Hemp Association.
[36:17.650 --> 36:19.010]  We've got a great team to connect
[36:19.010 --> 36:21.730]  and happy to provide resources.
[36:21.730 --> 36:22.570]  And-
[36:22.570 --> 36:23.410]  We appreciate that.
[36:23.410 --> 36:25.290]  Yeah, your team at Cornell has been fabulous.
[36:25.290 --> 36:27.610]  Daniela, thank you very, very much.
[36:27.610 --> 36:28.450]  You're great.
[36:32.020 --> 36:36.020]  So our next speaker this morning is John Hanchar.
[36:36.020 --> 36:41.020]  And John is a farm business management specialist
[36:41.300 --> 36:43.580]  with Cornell Cooperative Extension
[36:43.620 --> 36:46.660]  on the Northwest New York Dairy,
[36:46.660 --> 36:48.660]  Livestock and Field Crops team.
[36:49.660 --> 36:54.660]  John focuses in the areas of farm economics and management.
[36:56.020 --> 36:58.380]  His research focus has been on developing
[36:58.380 --> 37:01.700]  applied economic analysis to evaluate changes
[37:01.700 --> 37:03.980]  in practices and or technology
[37:05.620 --> 37:08.260]  to help inform decision-making.
[37:08.260 --> 37:10.860]  Current projects involve economics
[37:10.860 --> 37:13.540]  of growing malt and barley in New York state,
[37:14.300 --> 37:17.100]  economics of growing industrial hemp in New York state,
[37:17.100 --> 37:18.940]  and best benefits and costs
[37:18.940 --> 37:21.580]  of precision farming technologies.
[37:21.580 --> 37:23.980]  So John has been our economist
[37:23.980 --> 37:25.940]  that have helped us evaluate
[37:26.820 --> 37:30.820]  some of the CBD growing projects
[37:30.820 --> 37:32.620]  that Larry Smart and Savannah,
[37:32.620 --> 37:35.460]  who spoke yesterday, have been involved in.
[37:35.460 --> 37:38.860]  So with that, John, I'm gonna turn it over to you.
[37:39.820 --> 37:43.180]  And he's gonna talk about risks in the hemp industry today.
[37:44.460 --> 37:45.300]  So, John.
[37:46.420 --> 37:48.860]  Yeah, so my name is John Hanchar.
[37:48.860 --> 37:52.100]  And we're working on a Northeast Extension
[37:52.100 --> 37:54.980]  risk management education project
[37:54.980 --> 37:56.940]  here in New York and also in Vermont.
[37:58.260 --> 38:01.860]  Lindsay Pashow, who's on maternity leave right now,
[38:01.860 --> 38:06.540]  has been the primary person that's been,
[38:06.540 --> 38:10.780]  that brought us together and put this project together.
[38:10.780 --> 38:14.140]  And we wanna report on that today.
[38:14.140 --> 38:16.500]  And I think just for context,
[38:16.500 --> 38:20.340]  a couple of things that Mandy mentioned just now
[38:20.340 --> 38:25.340]  regarding data, data points, forming expectations,
[38:27.660 --> 38:31.420]  things like understanding quality standards
[38:31.420 --> 38:35.420]  and other things have all come out of this work.
[38:35.420 --> 38:38.260]  And just real quickly,
[38:38.860 --> 38:43.460]  the framework is farmers face various risks
[38:43.460 --> 38:47.740]  or this value chain face various risks,
[38:47.740 --> 38:52.020]  production, marketing, labor, legal, and financial.
[38:52.020 --> 38:55.340]  And what we concluded from the work so far
[38:55.340 --> 38:59.460]  is that marketing, legal, and financial
[38:59.460 --> 39:03.700]  are the top three risk areas of priority
[39:03.700 --> 39:08.540]  for the participants that were involved in our work.
[39:08.540 --> 39:11.620]  And they really identified three things
[39:11.620 --> 39:16.620]  as far as the needs or what would benefit them
[39:18.900 --> 39:22.860]  for reducing risks in this industry
[39:22.860 --> 39:26.380]  to make it more likely that they'll decide
[39:26.380 --> 39:30.100]  to enter the industry and then also be successful.
[39:30.100 --> 39:33.380]  And so those were the, right off the top,
[39:33.980 --> 39:35.820]  the value of information
[39:35.820 --> 39:38.060]  and whether it's knowing standards,
[39:38.060 --> 39:40.420]  whether it's knowing the legal aspects,
[39:40.420 --> 39:44.820]  whether it's understanding the production possibilities,
[39:44.820 --> 39:48.380]  that was the most important thing
[39:48.380 --> 39:51.820]  that was mentioned by our participants.
[39:52.740 --> 39:56.820]  Secondly, the idea of contracts
[39:56.820 --> 40:00.100]  and it falls into the idea of information,
[40:00.100 --> 40:04.900]  but mentioned quite often in a very specific way.
[40:04.900 --> 40:07.980]  And I know that Mary and others at Cornell
[40:07.980 --> 40:12.980]  have put together good resources for forming contracts
[40:13.300 --> 40:16.580]  and making sure that they're executed properly.
[40:16.580 --> 40:19.700]  But it seems like maybe there's a need
[40:19.700 --> 40:24.420]  to improve how we get this information out there.
[40:24.420 --> 40:27.460]  And then the last thing is cooperatives,
[40:27.500 --> 40:31.060]  the value possibly of forming cooperatives
[40:31.060 --> 40:36.060]  and to see if they can help reduce the risks.
[40:37.140 --> 40:39.860]  So I'm going to start the presentation
[40:39.860 --> 40:42.900]  that Lindy pre-recorded back in December.
[40:42.900 --> 40:47.620]  And I thank her every week, it seems, for doing this.
[40:47.620 --> 40:50.700]  And we'll get started.
[40:53.340 --> 40:56.380]  Risk associated with the new hemp industry.
[40:56.420 --> 40:58.300]  Hemp growers and processors will supply-
[40:58.300 --> 40:59.340]  That's better.
[40:59.340 --> 41:01.940]  Into the risk associated with the hemp industry
[41:01.940 --> 41:05.020]  from five sources of agricultural risk.
[41:05.020 --> 41:07.860]  These five sources include production,
[41:07.860 --> 41:10.580]  marketing, financial constraints,
[41:10.580 --> 41:13.020]  legal concerns, and labor issues.
[41:16.020 --> 41:17.740]  Our planned project outcomes.
[41:18.980 --> 41:21.100]  To increase hemp growers and processors'
[41:21.100 --> 41:23.260]  understanding of risk and increase awareness
[41:23.260 --> 41:25.860]  of risk faced by the supply chain.
[41:25.860 --> 41:28.820]  For small hemp growers and processors working groups
[41:28.820 --> 41:31.420]  to analyze risk by assessing and evaluating
[41:31.420 --> 41:33.780]  alternative strategies to mitigate risk.
[41:34.900 --> 41:37.380]  Hemp growers and processors will become aware of
[41:37.380 --> 41:40.900]  and learn about solutions identified by small working groups.
[41:40.900 --> 41:42.660]  Hemp growers and processors will create
[41:42.660 --> 41:45.260]  and document risk management plans.
[41:45.260 --> 41:47.060]  And finally, hemp growers and processors
[41:47.060 --> 41:49.500]  will implement risk management plans
[41:49.500 --> 41:51.620]  to mitigate priority risk leading
[41:51.620 --> 41:55.740]  to improved economic viability of hemp enterprises.
[41:56.860 --> 42:00.220]  There are five forms of risk.
[42:00.220 --> 42:02.300]  This includes production, marketing,
[42:02.300 --> 42:05.100]  financial, legal, and human.
[42:05.100 --> 42:06.300]  In the next couple of slides,
[42:06.300 --> 42:08.780]  we're gonna give examples of risk
[42:08.780 --> 42:11.540]  that are associated with this project.
[42:11.540 --> 42:12.540]  And then followed by that,
[42:12.540 --> 42:14.380]  we're gonna go over the survey results
[42:14.380 --> 42:16.380]  from New York and Vermont.
[42:16.380 --> 42:21.380]  And then get into the solutions that the industry meetings
[42:22.460 --> 42:24.420]  and one-on-meetings concluded
[42:24.420 --> 42:26.180]  with the hemp growers and processors
[42:26.180 --> 42:27.380]  in New York and Vermont.
[42:29.580 --> 42:31.380]  When we talk about marketing risk,
[42:31.380 --> 42:34.020]  we're talking about our available price points
[42:34.020 --> 42:36.140]  that we can sell our product at,
[42:36.140 --> 42:38.780]  our available markets that we can sell our product
[42:38.780 --> 42:42.580]  into our hemp or our value added products.
[42:45.480 --> 42:47.320]  When it comes down to legal risk,
[42:47.320 --> 42:51.200]  examples of legal risk are our liability insurance,
[42:51.200 --> 42:53.480]  our property insurance,
[42:53.480 --> 42:54.960]  our contracts that we might have
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.400]  with our growers and processors,
[42:57.400 --> 43:01.840]  our taxes, and potential environmental risk.
[43:04.160 --> 43:06.400]  Financial risk would include
[43:06.400 --> 43:10.280]  our cost and availability of debt capital,
[43:10.280 --> 43:11.800]  the ability to meet cash.
[43:11.800 --> 43:16.800]  So being able to pay our employees, pay our bills,
[43:17.280 --> 43:19.520]  and then our ability to maintain
[43:19.520 --> 43:21.560]  and grow profitability of the business.
[43:22.560 --> 43:24.480]  When it comes down to human risk,
[43:24.480 --> 43:26.520]  our human risk would consist of
[43:26.520 --> 43:28.600]  having enough labor to work on our farm,
[43:28.600 --> 43:32.400]  having enough labor to work in our processing facilities,
[43:32.400 --> 43:35.600]  being able to uphold to the state
[43:35.600 --> 43:38.920]  and national labor regulations that are out there.
[43:38.920 --> 43:40.960]  And then also finding enough skilled labor
[43:40.960 --> 43:42.760]  to be able to work on your farm
[43:42.760 --> 43:44.560]  or your processing facilities.
[43:46.600 --> 43:48.760]  Examples of production risk would be
[43:48.760 --> 43:50.480]  on your farm, the weather,
[43:50.640 --> 43:52.840]  pests, diseases.
[43:52.840 --> 43:55.320]  And then in a processing facility for hemp,
[43:55.320 --> 43:57.640]  it would be the machinery,
[43:57.640 --> 43:59.240]  making sure that you have the correct machinery
[43:59.240 --> 44:03.760]  that is able to do the value added process
[44:03.760 --> 44:05.360]  that you're doing with the hemp.
[44:06.600 --> 44:08.880]  So for industry participation in this project,
[44:08.880 --> 44:11.120]  we reached out to hemp growers and processors
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.760]  in New York and Vermont in a couple of different formats.
[44:14.760 --> 44:17.760]  In New York and Vermont, we surveyed the industry
[44:17.760 --> 44:19.640]  so that the hemp growers and processors
[44:20.520 --> 44:24.400]  could identify sources of risk
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.560]  based on the five forms of risk that we're discussing.
[44:30.920 --> 44:34.000]  Then in New York, we held industry meetings
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.840]  that included growers and processors
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.000]  so they could review the survey results
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.760]  and then come up with potential solutions for the industry.
[44:43.760 --> 44:45.280]  And then on the Vermont side,
[44:45.280 --> 44:48.480]  we held one-on-one meetings
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.080]  with individuals to go over the survey's results.
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.440]  And then those individuals could come up with solutions
[44:56.440 --> 45:00.080]  that best would work for the industry in Vermont.
[45:03.620 --> 45:05.220]  So at our New York industry meetings
[45:05.220 --> 45:06.780]  and our one-on-one meetings,
[45:06.780 --> 45:09.820]  one of the big things that we made sure
[45:09.820 --> 45:11.260]  that the participants understood
[45:11.260 --> 45:13.900]  is that there are a lot of risks
[45:13.900 --> 45:16.220]  that are associated with the hemp industries.
[45:16.220 --> 45:19.980]  And although we can identify these risks,
[45:19.980 --> 45:23.660]  not everything is gonna be solved in these meetings.
[45:23.660 --> 45:27.940]  We're not gonna be able to potentially change regulations
[45:27.940 --> 45:30.180]  when it comes down to it.
[45:30.180 --> 45:34.020]  But the idea behind these meetings is find solutions
[45:34.020 --> 45:38.700]  such as have better contracts
[45:39.740 --> 45:42.580]  between growers and processors is one example.
[45:45.100 --> 45:46.580]  We just wanna make sure that you're aware
[45:46.580 --> 45:49.100]  that when it comes down to the survey results
[45:49.140 --> 45:52.060]  and the solutions for New York and Vermont,
[45:52.060 --> 45:56.340]  the results were basically the same between both industries.
[45:56.340 --> 45:58.900]  So we combined the information
[45:58.900 --> 46:01.340]  when it came down to the upcoming slides.
[46:02.980 --> 46:05.220]  The marketing risk survey results,
[46:05.220 --> 46:07.460]  growers and hemp processors determined
[46:07.460 --> 46:11.140]  that there was a lack of available processing capacity,
[46:11.140 --> 46:14.060]  especially for the fiber industry,
[46:14.060 --> 46:16.660]  market access for independent producers.
[46:17.660 --> 46:21.300]  There's issues in regards to regulations uncertainty,
[46:21.300 --> 46:25.220]  lack of FDA designations and standards.
[46:25.220 --> 46:28.540]  There's been issues in the FDA cracking down
[46:28.540 --> 46:30.980]  on any and all marketing claims.
[46:30.980 --> 46:34.180]  And then demand has been low for hemp,
[46:34.180 --> 46:37.620]  even when it comes down to perfect hemp that is grown.
[46:41.600 --> 46:43.040]  The hemp growers and processors
[46:43.040 --> 46:45.120]  that attended the industry meetings
[46:45.120 --> 46:47.480]  came up with some solutions for the industry
[46:47.520 --> 46:49.400]  based on the survey results.
[46:49.400 --> 46:53.720]  This included more clarity in regulatory markets,
[46:54.760 --> 46:58.400]  basically running smaller batches for processing,
[46:58.400 --> 47:00.720]  develop cooperatives for small,
[47:00.720 --> 47:04.280]  more of the craft grown or artisan grown hemp.
[47:05.560 --> 47:10.160]  If you, they've seen, if you sell directly from,
[47:11.080 --> 47:13.920]  to customers, there's a lower risk
[47:13.920 --> 47:17.680]  of dealing with issues with FDA claims.
[47:17.680 --> 47:21.440]  And then, work as an industry to share more information
[47:21.440 --> 47:23.640]  because in the past hemp growers and processors
[47:23.640 --> 47:27.520]  have been very secretive on what their practices are.
[47:31.210 --> 47:34.130]  The surveys results when it came down to legal risk
[47:34.130 --> 47:39.050]  included issues with contract breaches on purchases,
[47:39.050 --> 47:41.410]  issues with federal government
[47:41.410 --> 47:44.370]  in regards to the THC percentage.
[47:44.370 --> 47:47.170]  And then there's also the issue of customers
[47:47.170 --> 47:49.690]  and certainly about legal tracing amounts of THCs
[47:49.690 --> 47:52.330]  in full spectrum hemp products.
[47:54.690 --> 47:57.410]  When it came to legal risk solutions,
[47:57.410 --> 47:59.970]  the hemp growers and processors
[47:59.970 --> 48:01.610]  thought that a monthly newsletter,
[48:01.610 --> 48:04.250]  which included regular updates
[48:04.250 --> 48:08.450]  on what is happening in the industry would be very helpful.
[48:08.450 --> 48:11.410]  If stronger legal contracts were built
[48:11.450 --> 48:14.450]  between growers and processors,
[48:14.450 --> 48:18.730]  and if more education was developed for customers
[48:18.730 --> 48:20.450]  to learn about full spectrum products
[48:20.450 --> 48:22.090]  that are available on the market.
[48:23.330 --> 48:27.050]  According to the surveys results for financial risk,
[48:27.050 --> 48:31.050]  there have been many issues in regards to access
[48:31.050 --> 48:34.570]  to banks and services and insurance that's available.
[48:34.570 --> 48:35.890]  Economic development grants
[48:35.890 --> 48:39.250]  and financing opportunities are not available.
[48:39.250 --> 48:40.930]  Capital is hard to get.
[48:41.450 --> 48:42.850]  Capital investment for fiber production
[48:42.850 --> 48:45.610]  involving large scale investments upfront
[48:45.610 --> 48:46.970]  to scale to profit.
[48:49.530 --> 48:50.610]  At the industry meeting,
[48:50.610 --> 48:52.570]  the hemp growers and processors found that
[48:52.570 --> 48:54.130]  when it came down to financial risk,
[48:54.130 --> 48:56.570]  there are solutions in order to finance
[48:56.570 --> 48:59.530]  for growing and for processing of hemp.
[48:59.530 --> 49:01.050]  It just takes a little bit of time.
[49:01.050 --> 49:02.530]  You need to spend some time calling around
[49:02.530 --> 49:05.130]  to different financial institutions,
[49:05.130 --> 49:09.450]  asking if they will support your business.
[49:09.450 --> 49:11.530]  And they did see that if you call around
[49:11.530 --> 49:13.930]  to like smaller banks or institutions,
[49:13.930 --> 49:18.250]  they were more willing to work with processors and growers.
[49:20.330 --> 49:22.290]  Hemp growers and processors saw that
[49:22.290 --> 49:25.410]  when it came down to issues in the industry
[49:25.410 --> 49:27.850]  for human and labor,
[49:27.850 --> 49:30.610]  the main risks were there's a shortage of supply
[49:30.610 --> 49:35.610]  of skilled and unskilled labor, high labor costs.
[49:35.730 --> 49:39.010]  Sometimes there's been issues with inside job thieves
[49:39.570 --> 49:40.890]  and people ruin the entire crop
[49:40.890 --> 49:44.170]  at the end of the drying process.
[49:44.170 --> 49:48.290]  Textile manufacturing would need more production avenues
[49:48.290 --> 49:50.730]  for different levels of processing.
[49:50.730 --> 49:55.250]  And the hemp industry tends to attract shady people
[49:55.250 --> 49:57.570]  is what was one of the results.
[49:57.570 --> 50:00.530]  So that's been a mixed bag of characters.
[50:02.610 --> 50:07.010]  When it came to solutions for human and labor risk issues,
[50:07.010 --> 50:08.930]  the hemp growers and processors felt
[50:08.930 --> 50:11.530]  that if they could find veterans
[50:11.530 --> 50:13.650]  that are transitioning into the industry,
[50:13.650 --> 50:17.010]  that would be a wonderful labor source for them.
[50:17.010 --> 50:20.250]  If they could share labor between different growers
[50:20.250 --> 50:22.890]  and processing plants.
[50:22.890 --> 50:26.090]  And a lot of the hemp growers and processors
[50:26.090 --> 50:29.210]  that I spoke to on the Vermont side, especially,
[50:29.210 --> 50:32.570]  were growing the hemp, but also processing it.
[50:32.570 --> 50:34.970]  And their advice was to start small
[50:34.970 --> 50:36.570]  and then slowly grow your business.
[50:37.130 --> 50:39.090]  And that has been very helpful and worked
[50:39.090 --> 50:41.690]  for these different hemp growers and processors.
[50:44.650 --> 50:46.530]  When it came down to production risk,
[50:46.530 --> 50:48.450]  according to the survey results,
[50:48.450 --> 50:50.970]  the issues have been in regards to pests
[50:50.970 --> 50:53.770]  and pathogens remaining poorly understood.
[50:53.770 --> 50:57.410]  Issues with the percentage of THC,
[50:58.370 --> 51:01.530]  the inability to certify commercial kitchens,
[51:01.530 --> 51:04.890]  the issue of impurities in the soil
[51:04.890 --> 51:08.010]  and the hemp basically pulling up those impurities
[51:08.010 --> 51:10.730]  and putting them into your hemp crop.
[51:11.930 --> 51:16.930]  Issues with wind, rain and dew.
[51:17.850 --> 51:19.650]  So we've got issues with the weather.
[51:19.650 --> 51:24.090]  And then issues with correct industrial genetics
[51:24.090 --> 51:26.570]  for the hemp plant that you're growing
[51:26.570 --> 51:29.210]  based on the climate and location.
[51:31.130 --> 51:34.730]  Solutions for production risk included researching more
[51:35.570 --> 51:39.570]  on the genetics of hemp, educate hemp growers
[51:39.570 --> 51:42.610]  and processors on the different impurities
[51:42.610 --> 51:45.570]  that are in the soil that can be pulled up
[51:45.570 --> 51:47.450]  into the hemp plant.
[51:47.450 --> 51:49.930]  And then also potentially creating a newsletter
[51:49.930 --> 51:54.410]  that goes out weekly, bi-weekly, monthly,
[51:54.410 --> 51:56.410]  especially during the growing season
[51:56.410 --> 51:59.770]  to provide the information to the growers
[51:59.770 --> 52:04.770]  on what pests and pathogens are in the environment.
[52:07.050 --> 52:10.210]  After the survey results, industry meetings
[52:10.210 --> 52:13.290]  and one-on-one meetings with hemp growers and processors
[52:13.290 --> 52:16.050]  in New York and Vermont, it was determined
[52:16.050 --> 52:20.290]  that the priority risk areas are marketing,
[52:20.290 --> 52:21.770]  legal and financial.
[52:23.250 --> 52:27.690]  So from there, the focus needs to be on finding
[52:27.730 --> 52:31.970]  and creating solutions for the industry.
[52:31.970 --> 52:34.170]  So as we can see from this model,
[52:34.170 --> 52:36.290]  we've defined the problem,
[52:36.290 --> 52:39.770]  we've created understanding of the situation.
[52:39.770 --> 52:43.690]  The one-on-one consultations and industry meetings
[52:43.690 --> 52:45.610]  created a list of solutions.
[52:46.970 --> 52:49.410]  We've selected the different areas
[52:49.410 --> 52:50.570]  that we're gonna concentrate on
[52:50.570 --> 52:52.890]  for those solutions in the future.
[52:52.890 --> 52:54.970]  And then moving forward in the next year,
[52:54.970 --> 52:56.810]  we're gonna be setting up goals,
[52:56.810 --> 53:00.690]  implementing solutions and reflecting on the results.
[53:03.210 --> 53:04.970]  Our plan for the next year of the project
[53:04.970 --> 53:06.330]  is we're gonna prepare a report
[53:06.330 --> 53:08.730]  that summarizes the risk and solutions
[53:09.690 --> 53:12.530]  that were determined by the hemp growers and processors
[53:12.530 --> 53:13.970]  in New York and Vermont,
[53:13.970 --> 53:17.250]  in specifically to marketing, legal and financial.
[53:17.250 --> 53:20.690]  We plan to continue to work with hemp growers
[53:20.690 --> 53:23.930]  one-on-one to identify solutions for the industry.
[53:24.810 --> 53:27.130]  And then hold one more industry meeting
[53:27.130 --> 53:30.490]  potentially in Vermont and New York
[53:30.490 --> 53:33.290]  to identify solutions.
[53:33.290 --> 53:36.650]  And then share the results that we have from this project
[53:36.650 --> 53:40.370]  at our hemp field days in New York and Vermont.
[53:41.770 --> 53:45.610]  We're really looking for input from hemp growers
[53:45.610 --> 53:47.770]  and processors all throughout New York and Vermont.
[53:47.770 --> 53:49.850]  So if you wanna be part of this project at all,
[53:49.850 --> 53:53.050]  please reach out to myself or John
[53:53.090 --> 53:57.610]  and we'd be happy to have your input in this project.
[54:00.580 --> 54:01.580]  Janice.
[54:01.580 --> 54:02.420]  Yes.
[54:02.420 --> 54:06.140]  Can I just mention that we do have a four page summary
[54:06.140 --> 54:11.140]  report that was provided for expo purposes.
[54:12.300 --> 54:16.220]  And I'm not sure just how you're gonna circulate those,
[54:16.220 --> 54:18.700]  but there is something available
[54:18.700 --> 54:21.580]  that provides a little greater detail.
[54:21.580 --> 54:22.660]  Thank you.
[54:22.660 --> 54:24.620]  Thank you, John, for mentioning that.
[54:24.620 --> 54:26.620]  There is a resource site.
[54:26.620 --> 54:29.700]  Yeah, there will be proceedings like, yeah,
[54:29.700 --> 54:31.900]  there'll be when we're all done.
[54:33.260 --> 54:34.100]  Okay, thanks Janice.
[54:34.100 --> 54:39.100]  So now it's time for our hemp entrepreneur panel.
[54:40.380 --> 54:44.780]  And I'm very happy to introduce our three panelists
[54:45.860 --> 54:49.300]  who include Tim McDowell from Bristol Extracts
[54:49.300 --> 54:50.860]  located in Rochester.
[54:51.860 --> 54:52.700]  Hello.
[54:52.700 --> 54:54.460]  You guys are all sitting in order on my screen.
[54:54.460 --> 54:55.500]  So that's great.
[54:55.500 --> 54:59.940]  Brittany Carbone with her company is Tonic CBD.
[54:59.940 --> 55:03.060]  She's located outside of Owego, New York.
[55:03.060 --> 55:06.100]  And Max Huber with Beacon SCIF.
[55:07.620 --> 55:11.980]  So they're each gonna present the story of their business,
[55:11.980 --> 55:14.700]  the entry and development of their products
[55:14.700 --> 55:17.660]  and potentially different hurdles they faced
[55:17.660 --> 55:20.380]  or thoughts for the future.
[55:20.420 --> 55:24.900]  So with that, Tim, you're first on my screen.
[55:24.900 --> 55:27.220]  Do you mind kicking us off?
[55:27.220 --> 55:28.060]  Let's do it.
[55:28.060 --> 55:30.620]  I know we didn't really draw something together last night.
[55:30.620 --> 55:33.260]  So I was a late entry here.
[55:36.700 --> 55:38.620]  So my name is Tim McDowell.
[55:38.620 --> 55:41.860]  I'm the COO of Bristol Extracts.
[55:43.020 --> 55:47.180]  Relatively new to the New York hemp scene,
[55:47.180 --> 55:51.900]  though I have a long experience with high THC cannabis.
[55:52.900 --> 55:56.820]  I was fortunate to be right place, right time in Denver.
[55:56.820 --> 56:01.820]  And we started a vertical integrated dispensary processing
[56:02.300 --> 56:05.740]  grow transferred from black market
[56:05.740 --> 56:08.620]  to medical market in Colorado.
[56:10.300 --> 56:14.180]  Did a lot of R&D on product development then.
[56:14.180 --> 56:19.180]  And then 2014, we expanded that into adult use in Colorado
[56:19.820 --> 56:22.540]  and became one of the first MSOs
[56:22.540 --> 56:26.260]  back when you could be a owner operated MSO
[56:26.260 --> 56:28.220]  in the cannabis world.
[56:28.220 --> 56:30.980]  We expanded to Nevada and Illinois in 2015
[56:30.980 --> 56:33.820]  with our brand of infused products
[56:33.820 --> 56:37.220]  to varying levels of success.
[56:38.100 --> 56:41.140]  We learned some very expensive lessons then.
[56:41.180 --> 56:43.220]  We were two of us partners,
[56:43.220 --> 56:45.500]  never took outside money and funded it.
[56:46.860 --> 56:48.940]  Got interested in hemp around this time
[56:48.940 --> 56:51.700]  and we started a genetics program in Colorado
[56:51.700 --> 56:54.380]  really in 2012, 2013,
[56:54.380 --> 56:57.740]  trying to create a one-to-one strains
[56:57.740 --> 57:01.900]  using some of these sour tsunami and canna tonic strains.
[57:01.900 --> 57:04.020]  And then honestly quickly realized
[57:04.020 --> 57:05.380]  we were out of our wheelhouse
[57:05.380 --> 57:07.580]  and started working with a tissue culture lab
[57:07.780 --> 57:12.780]  and stabilizing some high CBD cannabis genetics.
[57:13.140 --> 57:16.140]  I exited that business over COVID,
[57:16.140 --> 57:17.700]  took a job with Bristol Extracts.
[57:17.700 --> 57:21.500]  I'm from Pennsylvania, so came back to the East Coast.
[57:21.500 --> 57:24.060]  Bristol Extracts has been in a hemp business
[57:24.060 --> 57:27.500]  here in New York for going on four years now
[57:27.500 --> 57:30.500]  as a cultivator genetics,
[57:30.500 --> 57:33.980]  also creating genetics, cultivating, extracting
[57:33.980 --> 57:36.700]  and product manufacturer.
[57:38.260 --> 57:40.060]  So we're located,
[57:40.060 --> 57:41.940]  the facility is located in Bristol Valley
[57:41.940 --> 57:43.100]  outside Canandaigua.
[57:43.100 --> 57:45.900]  I can see from where I'm sitting the ski resort here.
[57:45.900 --> 57:48.940]  So it's a beautiful place to work.
[57:48.940 --> 57:53.940]  We have about a 20,000 square foot GMP certified facility.
[57:54.260 --> 57:59.020]  We just passed our renewal audit last Tuesday, 97%.
[57:59.020 --> 58:01.580]  So we're pretty stoked about that.
[58:01.580 --> 58:04.860]  And we have 30 acres around here
[58:04.860 --> 58:07.500]  with some good soil that we've planted on here
[58:08.380 --> 58:11.260]  in addition to some offsite fields as well in the past.
[58:11.260 --> 58:13.180]  The facility is pretty amazing.
[58:13.180 --> 58:14.780]  It's geothermal heated and cooled.
[58:14.780 --> 58:17.700]  It's very green building, green roofs.
[58:17.700 --> 58:20.220]  All of our toilet water is rainwater.
[58:20.220 --> 58:22.460]  We have about 25,000 gallons cistern
[58:22.460 --> 58:25.860]  under the ground out back to catch water.
[58:25.860 --> 58:28.660]  And then we have a creek and a pond,
[58:28.660 --> 58:32.300]  a pond that we built for the geothermal system onsite.
[58:34.260 --> 58:37.100]  So we, you can see our warehouse there.
[58:37.740 --> 58:39.260]  The picture's a little outdated.
[58:39.260 --> 58:43.860]  So we'll bring in plant material, process, pre-process it.
[58:43.860 --> 58:46.820]  We do mostly ethanol extraction.
[58:46.820 --> 58:47.900]  We've started to dabble.
[58:47.900 --> 58:51.540]  We have a pretty amazing solventless system in house now
[58:52.620 --> 58:54.020]  that we're doing some R&D on,
[58:54.020 --> 58:55.940]  but our ethanol has been the bread and butter
[58:55.940 --> 58:57.940]  for the past few years.
[58:57.940 --> 59:00.300]  It's a large system that we can process
[59:00.300 --> 59:02.500]  up to about 3000 pounds a day.
[59:02.500 --> 59:05.220]  So that comes with its own challenges.
[59:05.660 --> 59:07.660]  And then we have the post-processing tech
[59:07.660 --> 59:09.380]  on the backside of that,
[59:09.380 --> 59:12.700]  which is a lot of it's run through a white film distillation.
[59:12.700 --> 59:15.860]  We do micro nanoparticulation, water solubility,
[59:15.860 --> 59:18.140]  all the what's becoming quickly the standard
[59:18.140 --> 59:19.340]  in the business.
[59:19.340 --> 59:22.260]  And then we have our quality control systems in house.
[59:22.260 --> 59:26.500]  And that is HPLC testing, our MRP system,
[59:26.500 --> 59:28.580]  which is our software to kind of monitor
[59:28.580 --> 59:31.060]  all of our manufacturing.
[59:31.060 --> 59:35.180]  And so we're pretty tech focused here.
[59:36.140 --> 59:39.220]  We've done a lot of R&D for products outside of our company,
[59:39.220 --> 59:44.180]  as well as branded products and just developing IP,
[59:44.180 --> 59:48.300]  honestly, in the hemp space as the business
[59:49.220 --> 59:51.180]  prior to me coming on kind of pivoted
[59:51.180 --> 59:53.500]  from a toll processing grower,
[59:53.500 --> 59:57.180]  just processing crude oil into its own,
[59:57.180 --> 01:00:02.180]  more vertical without the retail and product business.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.100]  What's the next question here?
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.100]  How do we go about deciding our products?
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.580]  So, we watch for trends in cannabis,
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.860]  consumer packaged goods, nutraceutical,
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.300]  as we all know hemp cannabinoids
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.060]  have been commoditized relatively quickly
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.100]  and THC is on the same path.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.140]  And so I think that we can see,
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.140]  there are differences between the cannabinoids
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.940]  of what the end product use is.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.340]  We have a system of focus groups that we use
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.380]  both more in-person now actually,
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.380]  but a lot of online as we're expanding
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.420]  into some international sales,
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.860]  we get into these different communities
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.980]  and just different needs and different wants
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.580]  for what the products are.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.340]  So it's a large learning curve for us to learn
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:02.100]  what people want, can we fulfill it?
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.580]  Is it within our wheelhouse?
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.820]  And if it's not, sometimes we'll do that R&D
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.420]  and then simply, well, none of it's simple,
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.100]  but sell or license that into a market
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.020]  that then is off of our manufacturing hands.
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.540]  Because we are not co-packing for anybody else
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.180]  and we are not having any of our products co-packed.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.940]  I know we're behind, so I'll keep talking quick here.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:30.420]  I think industry improvements,
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.380]  I'm taking my expertise from the cannabis world
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.940]  into the marijuana world, really,
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.380]  I know it's all cannabis, but into the hemp world,
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.980]  educate, educate, educate.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.980]  And the more that we can educate the end consumer,
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:50.300]  the retailer, the regulators, whoever it is,
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.180]  as an industry, we need to have a consistent voice.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.620]  If Mac and his company over there are doing great
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:04.460]  and we at Bristol mess up something in our products,
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.180]  it kind of muddies the waters for hemp as a whole.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:13.180]  And so good processors and good businesses
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.620]  need to really carry the torch.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.500]  I think the no green rush mentality is huge.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.780]  I think we're starting to see that again
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.780]  with hemp farmers thinking that the provisional rule
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.820]  here in New York is gonna kind of save them
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.980]  where it may be a pitfall right back
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.180]  into where they were two years ago.
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.620]  And so build a long-term business strategy.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.780]  The price of cannabinoids through hemp
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:46.180]  and marijuana high THC is continuing to go down
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.700]  and it will continue to go down.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.180]  If you look at Michigan, the report that just came out,
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.140]  prices are bombing out there.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.500]  Back to carrying the torch, poor quality,
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.140]  overhyped businesses.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.860]  There's snake oil salesmen all through the hemp world.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.860]  Don't be them, call them out, demand C of A's.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.980]  If you're making label claims,
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.260]  customers and retail need to have them backed up.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.540]  I gotta fit a Hunter Thompson quote in here somewhere.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.060]  There's no such thing as paranoia.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.460]  Your worst fears can come true at any moment.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.660]  That is so true in crazy businesses such as hemp.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.460]  You gotta take control of the situation as best as you can.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.420]  Get involved, stay involved through organizations,
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.860]  start organizations, join them, just get involved.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.260]  Get involved with people that disagree with you.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.260]  Talk it out, be transparent.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.780]  We're very transparent at Bristol.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.980]  Anyone's welcome to come see the facility,
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.260]  come see what we do.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.460]  We're continuing to learn.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.780]  Next steps for us as a company,
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.700]  entering into the adult use provisional licenses
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:55.500]  if we're so lucky to get one since we qualify,
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.980]  but also on the hemp side to continue our hemp CBD products,
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.300]  like I had mentioned before,
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.780]  expand into hopefully some international sales
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.580]  and just continue to work on the tech
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.780]  and build a good long business
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.100]  and be members of the community.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.180]  So thank you for the invite.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.180]  I learned I was gonna be involved in this last night,
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.580]  so I'm happy to come and talk.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.580]  And we really appreciate that flexibility, Tim.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.500]  Thank you.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.180]  Of course, thank you.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.780]  It was a great presentation.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.980]  I think we'll hold questions for now
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.780]  and try to get through our other two panelists.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.380]  So if you have a burning question,
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.580]  make a quick note to yourself so we can get to it after.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.780]  Okay.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:40.780]  So thank you for having me in last minute edition as well,
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.580]  but always happy to help out with Cornell
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.180]  and the Cooperative Extension Program.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.580]  Cornell and the Cooperative Extension
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.180]  and all of the fantastic work
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.980]  that you guys do for the hemp industry in New York.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.980]  So very happy to be here.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980]  I'm Brittany Carbone.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.980]  I'm the founder and CEO of Tonic CBD,
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.380]  also the co-founder of Tricola Farms and Bardo Labs.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.380]  Together, we form a craft boutique,
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.980]  a vertically integrated hemp CBD operation
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.380]  that spans across New York and Pennsylvania.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.180]  I'm also a board member of the New York Cannabis Growers
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.380]  and Process Association
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.380]  and the chair of the Association Sustainability Committee.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.980]  So that's really a big part of our business model,
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.980]  the sustainability,
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:24.380]  and really taking a much smaller boutique approach
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:27.980]  than what might've seen in Tim's facility.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:30.380]  We're not doing 3,000 pounds a day.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.180]  We're doing about 10,000 pounds a year of capacity,
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.780]  really focusing on strain-specific.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.980]  I'm sorry, my dog's going a little crazy right now.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.180]  Excuse me.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.580]  It's quiet.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.780]  But get into that a little bit more.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.580]  So this is our supply chain right here.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.780]  It all starts in Tricola Farms.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.580]  That material goes to Bardo Labs.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.580]  We do single-origin extracts,
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.780]  meaning that everything that we process
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.180]  comes from Tricola Farms
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.580]  unless we are entering into a contract,
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.780]  toll processing for other small farmers in the area.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.980]  It is a service that we did not plan on offering at first,
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.580]  but because you have to be adaptable in the hemp market,
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.780]  you need to be able to pivot on a very short notice
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.980]  and be able to be open to opportunity
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.180]  wherever it presents itself.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:21.380]  So really, the way that we like to stay adaptable
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.180]  while staying true to our business model
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.380]  and our vision of really small-scale,
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.980]  craft, sustainable practices
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.980]  is by making sure that any way that we're expanding
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.180]  or pivoting away from that original business model
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.780]  is still in line with those values.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.180]  So like I said, we're working with very small-scale
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.180]  farmers who are looking to get their material processed,
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.580]  be able to have a better path to market,
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.780]  a more profitable path to market
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.980]  than just selling biomass
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.980]  because that is not a path to market right now.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:53.180]  As we all know, even just getting extracts back
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.380]  is not really great.
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:57.780]  So farmers want to be able to sell their own product, right?
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.780]  Like that's the story that farmers can really leverage
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.580]  when they're creating a brand, right?
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.980]  Because they're not going to have the huge marketing budgets.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.380]  They're not going to have that kind of fuel behind them.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.580]  But what they can have is a story,
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:13.380]  a story of how this product was grown, how it was handled,
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.780]  what's the meaning behind it.
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.380]  So we wanted to offer that to farms
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.180]  to be able to make their own products with their material
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.380]  and tell that story,
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.180]  but then also be able to take, you know, brands,
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.980]  especially in indie and minority-owned brands
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.980]  in the beauty and wellness space,
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:32.180]  be able to allow them to leverage the Tracola Farm story.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.380]  So that's, you know, we'll get into that a little bit more,
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.580]  but that's kind of the model that we're creating here
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.580]  is really taking very intentional,
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:43.380]  sustainably grown material that very high quality,
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.180]  processing it in a very, again, intentional
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:50.180]  and, you know, craft artisanal kind of way,
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.580]  making innovative products that are going to be competitive
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.180]  even in the most crowded market,
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.380]  and then funneling those extracts and those products
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:59.380]  either into the tonic brand or into the brand
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.980]  that our lab fuels.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.180]  So Tracola Farms is one of the first
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.580]  privately licensed hemp farms in New York State,
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.980]  licensed back in 2017.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:14.380]  I should say, privately licensed to grow cannabinoids.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.780]  We are located in Berkshire, New York.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.180]  So right between Ithaca and Binghamton,
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.180]  which is, you know, a great area to be nestled in between,
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.580]  family-owned and operated.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:25.780]  We've had this property since 2004.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.980]  My husband and I actually got married.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.980]  I guess my husband is this picture right here.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.580]  And we got married on the farm 2015.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.380]  We started to spend a lot more time up there.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:37.380]  And then when I created the tonic product line,
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.180]  which I created out of my own need
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.580]  to try to find a natural way to manage my anxiety
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.580]  and depression, I was working as a personal trainer
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.380]  at the time, certified nutrition and health coach,
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.980]  and just looking for these natural alternatives,
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:52.180]  something that could help me like cannabis always did,
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.780]  but was more workday friendly.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.180]  And that's really when I discovered CBD in late 2016.
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.980]  And by early 2017, I was combining CBD with adaptogens,
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.980]  super foods, and these other herbs to really create
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.780]  a more synergistic and effective experience.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.780]  And these products changed my life.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:10.380]  I started to share them with my clients.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.180]  My clients were getting the same kind of results.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.180]  And that's when I really started to be like,
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.580]  wow, this could actually be a business.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:18.580]  Like it was, you know, early 2017, like right,
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.780]  you know, perfect timing to enter the CBD industry,
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.580]  you know, before it really exploded.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.380]  But the problem being that I was having
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.580]  a really difficult time sourcing
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.980]  consistently high quality material.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.180]  So that was why we were like, well, we have all this
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.780]  property upstate, we're spending more time up there anyway.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.380]  We decided to leave our full-time jobs on Long Island
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.780]  and move full-time up to the farm with my parents,
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:43.580]  with my uncle and my father-in-law at the time,
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.780]  we were just all a big happy family,
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.180]  growing hemp for the first year.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.580]  And yeah, we definitely learned a lot.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.180]  We got our hemp stolen from us, from one of these bad actors
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.980]  that you were talking about earlier.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.980]  It's been an absolutely wild ride.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.980]  So the one year that we were in the hemp industry
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.380]  where farming was actually profitable,
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.980]  we got our crops stolen from us.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.780]  We were able to retain some of it, you know,
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:06.780]  but this is the reality of the hemp and cannabis industry.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.380]  Right? Like Tim was saying, like,
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.980]  you can't just go after this for the money
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.780]  because you're going to get your heart broken real quick.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.780]  Right? You got to be able to stay in there
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.980]  and, you know, really have some passion that drives you
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.380]  and some, you know, really something that's going
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.780]  to ground you in the madness, so to speak.
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:24.780]  But like I said, we were kind of just, you know,
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.980]  stayed true to the vision.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:30.380]  We are very brand focused, very much, you know,
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.980]  focused on developing brands through all part
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.780]  of the supply chain to be able to add value,
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.180]  like bi-directional value through the supply chain.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.380]  Right? So that's really a big part of how we are able
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:45.180]  to also drive value into the farm through agro-tourism.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.780]  That's a big part of what we offer during the summer is,
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.580]  you know, farm tours, farm visits, educate people
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.380]  about the importance of sustainable craft cultivation
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.780]  and cannabis, about, you know, taking care of the land,
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:59.580]  about appreciating where your cannabis products come from,
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:00.880]  where your food products come from.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.380]  Right? And it's a lot of bringing people up from the city
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.180]  who don't usually have this experience to, you know,
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.080]  get a more kind of hands-on experience on these farms
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.480]  and be able to connect to the source
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.480]  of their healing like this.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.980]  So that's been a really great kind of addition
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.980]  to our business model, especially on the farm side
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:22.980]  where, you know, the profits aren't as easy to come by.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.080]  And then we have Bardo Labs, like I said,
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.580]  a state-of-the-art, excuse me,
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:31.680]  boutique-scale manufacturing and processing facility
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.180]  in Seyer, Pennsylvania.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.980]  We're just over the New York border into Pennsylvania.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.880]  We are CGMP compliant, just waiting on our audit,
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.180]  which is coming in the next couple of months.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.080]  So everybody wish us luck on that.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.480]  And we are making custom formulations
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.780]  and white label products, like I said,
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.280]  both for, you know, fueling the Tonic brand,
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.280]  which is, you know, our flagship in-house brand,
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.180]  as well as, you know, about 30 other brands
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:58.380]  in the wellness and beauty space,
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.980]  which I'm very proud to say that 90% of those brands
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.080]  are minority-owned.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.780]  And that's really what our focus is,
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.980]  is empowering and uplifting and democratizing ownership
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.280]  across the space and creating a launch pad
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.680]  for these brands to really create innovative products
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.780]  and not just have to be forced to kind of just white label
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.780]  to have a pathway to ownership,
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.080]  to actually be able to have IP and be able to, you know,
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.280]  create something that's innovative and that can compete
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.180]  in a very crowded and very, you know,
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.880]  kind of monotonous industry as, you know,
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.180]  you walk into a CBD store
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.080]  and it's a lot of the same exact products
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.280]  with different labels on it, right?
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.180]  And that's exactly what we want to try to avoid.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.180]  All right, and then finally,
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.580]  Tonic, our finished product line, you know,
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.180]  do direct to consumer and retail distribution,
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.980]  focusing on innovative herbal tincture blends.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:46.880]  Like I was saying before,
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.380]  when I started to really combine CBD
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.680]  with all these other adaptogens and superfoods
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.880]  is when I really started for myself to feel
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.580]  like this is actually, you know, life-changing results
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.380]  that I was feeling, right?
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.780]  Where CBD was able to get me most of the way,
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.780]  adaptogens were able to get me most of the way,
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.780]  combining the two in a very, you know, mindful way,
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.280]  was able to get me the results
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.280]  that I was really looking for.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.680]  And that's kind of been the thought process
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.680]  and pattern that has kind of taken shape.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.180]  With the rest of the product line, some products, you know,
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.780]  we keep a lot more simple, but again, with, you know,
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:22.280]  a very targeted goal in mind when we're talking about,
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.480]  you know, what do we want,
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.480]  what results do we want the products to elicit?
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.980]  Each product is designed to, you know,
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.480]  really target specific need states much more consistently
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.380]  because, you know, that's the great and, you know,
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:37.180]  tricky thing about CBD is that it can do so much,
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.680]  but it can lead to very varied results, right?
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.280]  So we kind of take the guesswork
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.580]  and the variability out of that by using CBD
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.280]  with all of these other synergistic ingredients.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.780]  So we also are distributing,
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.280]  starting to distribute other brands
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.480]  who source from Chicolo Farms and Bardo Labs.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.880]  So you see these chocolate bars that are in this photo here.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.080]  That is Flor de Maria, which is a brand
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.280]  that we've been working with to supply the CBD
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.880]  for since the very beginning.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.480]  And they are just add a really something different
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.880]  to our product line, really artisanal,
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.480]  delicious CBD-infused chocolates.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.280]  We're also, you know, starting to just bring in other brands
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.280]  that manufacture through Bardo and Chicolo Farms
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.780]  into the mix and really telling the story, again,
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.780]  more so of, you know, lifting up the value of craft
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:28.780]  and, you know, and minority-owned products as a whole,
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.380]  as, you know, kind of firm believer
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.080]  that the ships all rise with the tide.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.380]  So we're trying to really speak to the value
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.280]  of the sector of the industry as a whole
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.580]  and uplift conscious consumerism in a much broader way
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.180]  than just trying to focus on one brand in particular.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.780]  We believe that truly democratizing the space means
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.980]  and, you know, bringing the most healing to the most people
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.880]  truly means to reach into new audiences,
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.580]  leverage new audiences, and speak to people
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.480]  that maybe we don't know how to,
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.880]  that we wouldn't reach ourselves, right?
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.880]  To be able to expand that opportunity into the market,
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.380]  but then also expand the opportunity and ownership
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.480]  and really create a much more diverse marketplace.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.780]  So we have a very strong New York market presence.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.780]  You know, we've done a lot to, you know,
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.780]  really kind of build up our market in New York,
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.780]  which makes us, you know, very excited moving forward
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.280]  into the adult use market.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.280]  We do have a strong set of brands to go forward with
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.880]  and, you know, be able to really fuel
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.180]  with Tricola Farms THC flower
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:30.980]  like we have been with the CBD, on the CBD side.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.780]  So like I was saying before, you know,
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:36.080]  it's continue to see it being very important to drive value
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.780]  through the supply chain in both directions,
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.880]  meaning that, you know, the value of Tricola Farms
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:43.780]  and the quality that we stand by, the agritourism,
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.680]  all these things that we do through Tricola Farms
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.580]  drives value to the brands that Tricola Farms fuels.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.780]  And then the brand recognition from Tonic
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.280]  and the brands on the front end, on the retail side,
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.580]  the reputation that they have in the marketplace,
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:59.580]  the brand recognition that drives value into, you know,
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.180]  the other parts of the supply chain as well.
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.080]  So definitely, you know,
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.680]  finding ways to optimize the synergy going forward
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.480]  to enter into more brand licensing agreements
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.880]  through the THC market are all really opportunities
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.280]  that are definitely on top of mind right now.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.780]  And just really figuring out how to manage all of it,
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.180]  you know, as a very small business with limited capital
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.780]  and a limited team behind us.
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:26.180]  It's, every day is a new adventure, but love what we do.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.880]  And, you know, we're very, very passionate
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.980]  about helping people not only heal through our products,
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.680]  but helping people to, you know, actually gain ownership
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.880]  and, you know, have more opportunity in this industry,
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.980]  support our community, support education,
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:42.580]  and do all we can to educate about the importance
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.880]  of conscious consumerism within the cannabis space.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.480]  Wow, Brittany, thank you.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.180]  That was a really excellent presentation.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.980]  I feel like you were like forced to rush through it,
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.680]  but that was-
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.080]  Wanted to get it all in, you know?
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.280]  Yeah, no, thank you.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.880]  And it's nice to have a range of business sizes
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.080]  and, you know, directions here.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.080]  So I really appreciate that.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.180]  And the fact that you could join us
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.480]  with kind of late notice.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.380]  So our third panelist this morning is Mac Huber.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.580]  My name is Mac Huber.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:19.680]  I'm CFO of Beacon Skiff and 1911 Established.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.080]  And I'm also our general manager of our Cannabis Division,
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.280]  which we're calling Beacon Skiff Research.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.680]  For those of you who don't know,
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.980]  Beacon Skiff, we're just outside of Syracuse.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.780]  We're a 111 year old family owned apple orchard,
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:38.380]  about a thousand acre apple orchard.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.480]  And really what we specialize in is vertical integration.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.580]  We grow apples here, we press them,
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.380]  we ferment them into our hard cider and our spirits.
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:50.880]  And then we serve them at our tasting rooms on site here.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.080]  So, you know, our goals, I guess,
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.880]  we actually have three different beverage facilities
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.720]  on site here.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.820]  We have our canning and bottling line.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.620]  We have our natural drinks facility
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.920]  and a distillery on site.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.520]  So while we are an apple orchard at heart,
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.720]  really we're a premium beverage maker.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.120]  That's how we look at ourselves.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.020]  And we wanted to take the same seed to sip approach
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:21.420]  that we have with apples and our hard cider
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.120]  and apply that to hemp.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.220]  So we initially got into,
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.620]  we were interested in the hemp industry
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.620]  to long-term make cannabis infused beverages.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.220]  So CBD infused beverages.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.020]  And we wanted to take that same vertical integration model
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.420]  from apples and apply it to hemp.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.920]  So growing the hemp here, growing the organic hemp,
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:46.820]  extracting it with ethanol that we make at our distillery
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.220]  and then infusing it into beverages
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.920]  that we can here on site.
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.220]  You know, we looked at cannabinoids similarly
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.520]  to the other active ingredients of beverages
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.520]  that we work with right now.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:03.420]  So obviously ethanol, aka alcohol, and also caffeine.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.320]  So we do a lot of cold brew coffee.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.120]  And we looked at, you know, cannabinoids, CBD
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.220]  as just another active ingredient that we could work with.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:16.020]  And most people probably on this call are very familiar
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:20.720]  with the first two active ingredients, ethanol and caffeine
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.420]  and most are used to consuming that in a beverage form.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:27.620]  And we thought cannabinoids shouldn't be any different.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:35.320]  So, you know, we really set out to make compliant,
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.520]  organic CBD infused beverages.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.920]  And we actually, a year ago, came out with,
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.620]  I'm kind of forgetting the slide here.
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.820]  So our first CBD beverage.
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:50.920]  Now, this was a challenge in that,
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.420]  I'm sure Tim and Brittany know,
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.120]  New York only allowed CBD products to be made
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.220]  as a dietary supplement in a dietary supplement facility.
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:02.120]  So this was one of the regulation challenges that we had.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.820]  So we went through a whole dietary supplement audit
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.520]  on our canning facility.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.920]  It was already a really high food safety,
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.120]  SQF audited facility,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.520]  but now it's also a dietary supplement facility.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.320]  So that's how we were able to make a compliant beverage,
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.420]  a CBD beverage in New York
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.820]  and be able to ensure retailers in New York
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.720]  that they could keep this on shelf.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:30.820]  You know, one thing that we really wanted to separate ourselves
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:32.820]  from the other CBD beverages out there was,
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.020]  you know, this certified organic.
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:36.820]  To date, we're the only ones in the country,
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.620]  I think, with that logo on our cans.
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:44.420]  You know, that starts again with growing the organic hemp on site.
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:47.920]  The ethanol that we produce is certified organic.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.620]  Our extraction facility certified organic
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:55.420]  and ultimately the goal was to make organic products.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:21:00.020]  So kind of jumping to our extraction facility,
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:01.220]  we call the hemp house.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.520]  You know, we went with an ethanol extraction mainly again
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.320]  because we're used to working with ethanol at our distillery.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.820]  So we are kind of in between Tim and Brittany
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.020]  in terms of volume.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:18.920]  We kind of aim for around 500 pounds a day volume.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.920]  We focus a lot on organic extraction, so organic ethanol.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.720]  And you can see in a picture here,
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.920]  this is just the, on the right side here,
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.020]  this is our Delta Cup extractor.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:37.220]  And then on the next slide, you'll see our distillation skid.
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:41.120]  So we like to take, we like to extract to crude
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.420]  and then further refine into a distillate.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.820]  We just, for our products, we like to use just a distillate
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:48.920]  as the raw ingredients.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.920]  For us, it's just a more consistent clean ingredient.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.820]  With, you know, there's definitely been challenges
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.520]  in New York with beverages.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:07.720]  So while we were figuring out the canning facility challenges,
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.320]  we decided to diversify our product lineup
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.620]  and offer tinctures, gummies, balms.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:20.920]  We've since come out with drink mixes, lotions.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.920]  And so we really wanted to offer our customers different
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:28.120]  form factors to fit their everyday, you know, needs.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:36.420]  Our extraction facility, you know, so CGMP, certified organic,
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.920]  kosher, and we also do a lot of co-packing.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:45.720]  So Beacon, Skiffs, all of our facilities, about half
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.420]  of the capacity is for our own brands, and then half
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.020]  the capacity is for co-packing.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.020]  So we took that same model, applied it to our hemp house,
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.120]  and we co-pack for a good number of local New York brands
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.920]  and private label some as well.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.720]  What was the other question?
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.520]  Really, when we're deciding on making products, you know,
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.920]  one thing that we really focus on is obviously making
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.820]  really high quality products, but also at a price that's
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:21.220]  affordable to our consumers.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:24.420]  And beverages is a great example, right?
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.720]  We sell our individual cans for $2.50.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.220]  Each can has 20 milligrams of CBD.
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:36.420]  So it's a great entry product for the can of curious customer,
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:36.720]  right?
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.820]  They don't have to go out and spend the amount of dollars
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.720]  on a tincture or one of our balms.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.420]  They can try one of our seltzers.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.920]  So that's, you know, was our goal with our drinks and our
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:49.420]  tinctures.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:55.520]  We'd like to be, you know, a relatively, a price point that
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.720]  works for most consumers.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:03.620]  And really, more recently with the news, obviously with New
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.820]  York growing adult use, all the products that we're making,
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.020]  now, we will hopefully be able to transition over to THC.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:16.220]  So obviously drinks, big one tinctures, balms, that kind of
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:16.720]  stuff.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.120]  Let's see.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:24.020]  So I talked about some of the hurdles, obviously beverages
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.820]  is definitely a hurdle doing the dietary supplement.
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:32.320]  We've since then the Office of Cannabis Management has actually
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.220]  changed the regs.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:38.520]  So CBD can now be solely marketed as a nutritional label product.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:41.720]  So no longer a supplement panel, but a nutritional panel.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.920]  But at least this gives us the flexibility because actually
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.020]  we sell our CBD seltzers out of state and some states only
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:53.820]  allow CBD as a dietary supplement.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:58.020]  Some don't care and will allow as a nutritional label or a
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:58.720]  supplement label.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.120]  So these are, it gives us the versatility.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.120]  More recently though, with the hemp extract regs, there was
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.620]  language in there that was going to prevent cold chain CBD
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.920]  products or hemp based products.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.120]  We produce a little bit of CBD cold brew.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.320]  We actually do a lot of cold brew coffee here.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.320]  So we're familiar with it and we wanted to infuse it with
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.520]  some of our CBD as well.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:30.420]  We work to the regulators to help educate them on labels having
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.020]  all the correct expiration dates.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:36.720]  So consumers won't get confused about product going bad after
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.120]  three months or whatnot.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:43.220]  And also, it's very clear on the label that this product needs
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:44.420]  to be refrigerated.
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:50.120]  So we worked closely with the OCM to get that language removed.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:54.020]  And so hopefully we can start making some more CBD cold brew
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.320]  in the near future.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:01.020]  Looking ahead, really we're focusing on beverages.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.920]  That's kind of what we know and we'll be looking to build a new
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:11.520]  THC drink facility to really just focus on infusing either our
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.920]  seltzers, more coffee, or potentially a fresh cider with some THC.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.920]  So that's kind of our long view right now.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.220]  Yeah, and in terms of industry improvements, I'm going to piggyback
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.120]  off what Tim said.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.220]  I think it was perfect.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.620]  Educate, educate, educate.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:35.220]  And really, I think what New York did with their hemp regulations
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:39.020]  from a labeling standpoint, consumer safety, it was spot on.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:43.420]  So hopefully we see other states adopt this so that customers all
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:46.020]  across the country can feel confident when they're buying something.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:50.720]  What they're intaking is the actual marketed potency and there's
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.020]  no heavy metals or pesticides.
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:56.420]  So I think again, what New York did was amazing.
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.420]  And I hope other states follow suit.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:03.120]  So I'll stop there Janice because I know we're tight on time.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.420]  Thank you very much, Mac.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.820]  Thank you very much to all the panelists.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:15.220]  That was a nice range of business size and product development.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.020]  I hope our viewers found that interesting.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:22.520]  Mary, do we have time to allow a question or two?
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.220]  Yeah, actually I have one so I'm going to take it.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:32.620]  Brittany, you mentioned that your first profitable crop was stolen.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:36.620]  So without naming names, because I think it was one way and not the
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:40.720]  other, you sold it but never got a check.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.520]  Not you woke up one morning and it was just missing.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:44.720]  Exactly.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.820]  Yeah, I'll name names.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.820]  John Flynn, if anybody ever sees him, punch him in the face.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:54.620]  But honestly, we weren't the only farmers that he hit.
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.320]  It was a group of us that went into a group deal with him.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.220]  I'm bringing that back to John's conversation and I've done some
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:05.420]  stuff with contracts and whatnot.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:12.420]  And so Tim's on, we're trying to get Ag and Markets to have a
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:19.320]  bonding so that to encourage producers to only sell to bonded
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:24.020]  buyers so that there is recourse in the vegetable industry or fruit
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.020]  and vegetable industries.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:25.920]  We have this.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.120]  So I'm trying to build that up.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:33.720]  But of course, sellers, all of you that grow, have to stick to that.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.220]  If it's going to work and it's going to be a thing, then all the
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:42.320]  sellers have to only sell to bonded because all it takes is one guy
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.120]  who goes around and doesn't get the bonding but can get product and
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.720]  that's not worth anything anymore.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.520]  And it's not really a good system.
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:54.620]  So I just want to put that out there because there are a lot of
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:29:01.620]  shenanigans that I was shocked by and having worked with vegetable
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:07.420]  producers for many, many years and large sales, not really cash
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.320]  business, but that kind of handshaky kind of stuff like here's my
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.220]  stuff and you'll send me a check in two weeks.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.320]  Never having it been that bad before.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.120]  So yeah, they can get definitely tricky and that is definitely
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.120]  something now with THC.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.120]  I mean, Tim, you said it perfectly before that, we don't want to
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.820]  end up in the same position that we were in a few years ago with
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:34.120]  hemp. Now with the launch of these conditional licenses where people
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.420]  are getting a little bit over their skis a little bit, you know what
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.020]  I mean? And really making sure that we're doing this responsibly.
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:44.520]  And I do think that that really a big part of that becomes kind of
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:49.420]  joining together because this is, we are kind of need to
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.220]  join forces as hemp growers entering this into this new market and
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:57.420]  set the standards also for price points and what we're going to
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.220]  sell for and what we want to hold, what kind of terms we want to
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:07.320]  see and how do we compete with these larger out-of-state operators
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.320]  that are going to be coming in the ROs that are already here and
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.020]  how do we make sure that we're creating a marketplace that is fair
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:18.420]  kind of for farmers in general, creating opportunities and
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:22.120]  supporting each other rather than creating a race to the bottom.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.620]  Well said, well said.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.720]  Thank you, Brittany.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.020]  Yes.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:28.720]  Good afternoon.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.820]  Thank you for having me here to speak about the New York State
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:34.820]  Hemp Grower Licensing Program, Department of Agriculture and
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:38.320]  Markets. I'll have a short presentation and then I'll be able to
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.820]  take questions at the end.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.920]  That should be on there, but not everybody needs that exact specific
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:46.620]  thing.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:51.320]  Just to know up front, the 2018 Federal Farm Bill required that
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.620]  the New York State Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program, the
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.520]  program under which many of you may have been licensed in the past
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.620]  several years, that had to expire on January 1st, 2022.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.320]  This was something that had to occur in all states, though all
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.620]  those pilot programs expired at the beginning of this year.
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.620]  And the Farm Bill also provided that states wishing to administer
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:15.620]  a hemp licensing program had to have a plan approved by the
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.820]  USDA in order to be able to do that.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:22.720]  New York State submitted our hemp program plan to the USDA last
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.620]  year and it was approved in November.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:29.620]  If you want to take a look at that, you can go on the USDA webpage,
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:35.020]  just USDA hemp program, and you'll be able to find our program
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:39.520]  and that of all the other states that have been approved.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:47.520]  So new requirements in 2022, now that the pilot program has gone
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:52.120]  away and we're operating under a new program, all previously
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.620]  licensed growers, their license, those licenses have expired.
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:32:00.120]  So you will need to apply to the new program and get a new license.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:05.220]  There's also a hemp seed seller license required this year.
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.820]  If you're interested in selling hemp seeds, you would need to
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:09.320]  apply for that license.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.620]  That's a new thing this year.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:16.520]  We do have program guidance document on our website.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:22.020]  You can go there and it has a lot of information about the program
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.320]  and some frequently asked questions.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.320]  We have also adopted regulations this year, which is new.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:31.120]  In the past, we operated under that research partner agreement
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.320]  that any of you who were growers in the pilot program are familiar
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.420]  with, it was the contract that you signed between you and the
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.320]  state and pretty much was the way we regulated the program.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.020]  The new regs are available on our website, right on the homepage.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:47.520]  You scroll all the way down to law and regulations and it's the
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.220]  part 159 regs that you would want to look at.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:55.220]  We're hoping that having regulations in place will add some clarity
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:59.820]  and certainty to the growers in the program and to us, to be
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:00.620]  honest with you.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:07.420]  The FBI check has to be no more than 60 days old.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:11.620]  So if you have an old FBI check that you had done in the past
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:15.820]  for some other reason, that's not going to cut it for this purpose.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.920]  It has to be no more than 60 days old.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.020]  This is a federal requirement and we have to abide by that.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:25.720]  You can go to many post offices or law enforcement offices and
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.820]  they can do some fingerprinting for you and you submit them
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:32.220]  electronically to the FBI and they are turning them around really
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:34.020]  quickly if you submit electronically.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.520]  If however, you submit them hard copy, I've heard it several weeks
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:45.020]  now. Also new, total THC of not more than 0.3% is a standard for
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:45.620]  compliance.
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:49.520]  That total THC is the standard we have to go by now.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:50.920]  That is a federal requirement.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.820]  So we don't have any wiggle room there.
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:34:00.620]  Also new, the department will not be the primary sampler or tester
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:02.320]  of hemp crops this year.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:10.120]  The new federal requirements are such that all hemp lots, all fields,
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.720]  all greenhouses will have to be sampled and we just would not be
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.120]  able to meet that sampling responsibility.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.720]  So we are going into a system where we will be training private
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.520]  individuals interested in being certified sampling agents and they
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.520]  will be the ones that are hired by the growers.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.320]  The growers will be responsible for the cost of the sampling and
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.420]  testing. The private sampling agent will come out, take your samples
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:37.420]  and mail them to the lab of your choice.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:43.420]  We have a list of labs on our website that you can use for your
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:48.820]  testing. Growers cannot sample their own crop and they also cannot
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:49.920]  be sampling agents.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.520]  This is also dictated by the federal law.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.220]  So you will need to hire a private sampling agent.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:35:01.520]  Also new this year, but perhaps familiar to those of you who have
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.520]  farmed other crops in the past, is registering your growing locations
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.020]  with your local USDA Farm Service Agency office.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:13.320]  That needs to be done within 10 days after planting and then we will
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.420]  get the information.
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:17.420]  The FSA will send information to us.
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.120]  They will send it to the USDA and USDA in turn is going to notify the
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:26.920]  US Drug Enforcement Agency of all the growing locations for hemp in the country.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:35.340]  So applying for a license looks a lot very similar to what you've done
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:37.440]  in the past with a few changes.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.640]  As I mentioned, you also have to submit the FBI background check.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.740]  You do not have to have a research plan in place anymore.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.040]  This is no longer a research pilot program.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.740]  This is full-on commercialization.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:53.640]  So we've done away with the requirement for the research plan and we don't
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.040]  require that you submit a marketing plan with us.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:01.040]  We still do require you give us your name, address, and phone number, your EIN
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.340]  if you have one, if you're a sole proprietor, you don't necessarily have
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.140]  to have one of those.
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:12.440]  You'll need to provide us with the address and GPS coordinates for your
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.240]  growing locations along with a map or aerial photo of the locations
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.140]  depicting where the buildings and structures and access points are.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:24.040]  I'm going to say a word here about the GPS coordinates.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:29.840]  This is far and away the thing that holds up most of the applications that don't
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.340]  make it through on the first attempt.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:34.040]  People just do not get the GPS coordinates right.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:41.340]  So the way to do it, the best way that I found, go on Google Maps, you put in
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.540]  the address of your growing location.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.640]  When the map pops up, there's going to be a little satellite photo, aerial
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.940]  photo, thumbnail picture.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:55.240]  You click on that and then zoom in a bit and place your cursor either in the
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:58.340]  center of the field you're going to grow on or over the building you're going
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:03.140]  to use and right-click and the GPS coordinates will pop up in a box.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:08.840]  People that are trying to use their phones or other programs to find GPS,
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.940]  they're coming way off the mark.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.440]  I had one the other day that was in the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.640]  So try and go on.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:22.540]  I urge you strongly to use Google Maps to find the GPS coordinates.
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:26.640]  You'll still need to know where you're getting your seed from, what varieties
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.640]  you're going to get, and also what your area of focus will be, whether you're
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.140]  growing for fiber, grain, or CBD.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:38.340]  Also, there's a line on the application to let us know if you were in the
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:42.540]  program in the past, what your number was, your registration number.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:47.740]  And once again, it's a non-refundable $500 application fee and the license is
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:52.780]  good for three years.
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:57.680]  Just a few examples of reasons that applications get denied if the
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:02.780]  application isn't right or isn't complete, I can't approve that.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:06.780]  If you've had a recent drug-related felony, just drug-related felonies,
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.380]  other felonies don't matter.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:14.380]  Within 10 years, that would be a disqualifying feature that is a federal
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.880]  requirement.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.880]  Failing to provide us with a background check with the application,
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.980]  it's going to get denied.
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:25.380]  If you're trying to register a location that someone else already has registered,
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:28.180]  we're not allowing that to happen.
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:32.180]  We can't have two different growers in the same field.
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:37.780]  If a sample from that field was hot, you'd have to destroy the whole field.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.080]  So that just doesn't work out.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:46.680]  If you're proposing to grow in an area that is zoned residential or if you're
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:51.980]  proposing to grow inside a residence or an attached garage, that is not
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:54.580]  approvable.
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.680]  Failure to sign your application, failure to submit the application fee,
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:05.380]  and a couple other reasons that people's applications have been denied.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.180]  Other considerations.
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:11.780]  Know where you're going to sell your hemp before you plant.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:16.480]  Every fall, we get calls, I planted the hemp, now what do I do with it?
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.680]  And that's not a good situation to be in.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.680]  So really know what you're going to do, know what your market is before you
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:27.280]  plant the hemp, and it'll be a much more pleasant experience.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.180]  Know your zoning.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:30.380]  Zoning is a local issue in New York State.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:34.780]  So know what zoning regulations are in place in the area in which you're
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:36.580]  proposing to grow.
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:41.280]  And once again, you can't grow in a house or an attached garage.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:46.480]  Growers will be routinely inspected at least once per the three-year licensing
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.780]  cycle, but we reserve the right to inspect more frequently if that's warranted.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:57.880]  And once again, know the characteristics of the varieties you're going to plant.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:01.280]  If they have a tendency to go hot, make sure you stay on top of sampling
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.980]  throughout the growing season so that you don't end up in a situation where
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:07.980]  you're going to have to destroy your crop in the fall.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:13.980]  Once again, THC is based, total THC is the standard now.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:21.680]  So no more than 0.3% total THC.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:24.680]  And now back to the certified sampling agents.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.680]  Just for a minute, I'll explain some of that program.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.680]  We do have a training module that's available and a brief exam that you would
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.680]  take if you're interested in being a sampling agent.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.980]  You would need to have a valid driver's license, be 21 years of age, have a
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:45.180]  background check done just like the growers do.
[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:48.980]  And then you would determine which counties in the state you'd want to serve and what
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:50.580]  your service area will be.
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:55.880]  You're going to be your own boss, so you'll be able to make that determination for yourself.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:00.780]  You'll set your own price for sampling and mailing the samples to the growers.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:06.880]  Chosen Lab, we recommend that you have liability insurance, highly recommend that.
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:11.380]  And if this sounds like something that you are interested in or if you know
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:17.380]  someone that may be interested in becoming a sampling agent, please contact
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.380]  Chuck Schmidt at the Department of Agriculture and Markets.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:23.580]  He is coordinating the sampling agent program.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:30.680]  You can be reached at 518-807-7194.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.680]  So I've come to the end of my presentation and I'm going to take some questions here.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:40.680]  But before I start taking questions, I need to let everyone know that any questions
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:46.680]  regarding growing adult-use marijuana, medical marijuana, marijuana dispensaries,
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:52.180]  CBD processing, the sale of CBD products or raw hemp flower smokables should be
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.280]  addressed to the Office of Cannabis Management.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:59.280]  That's the agency that's responsible for all things marijuana and all things CBD
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.280]  other than CBD hemp growing.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.280]  So here is their contact information.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.280]  If you don't have an opportunity to write this all down, you can Google
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:12.280]  New York State OCM and you will get to their webpage.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:21.280]  Tim, I don't know if you want to step there because that was information.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:22.380]  Sure.
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:26.380]  I'm all set for questions now.
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:29.380]  I guess if anybody has any, I know we're over time here.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:30.380]  Sorry.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.380]  That's my bad.
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:34.380]  It's probably not.
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.380]  It's probably something I did wrong.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.380]  I'll take it though.
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.380]  Okay.
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:45.960]  So I have a couple of questions.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.960]  Are you restricting varieties that people can grow?
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.960]  We don't restrict varieties.
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:43:01.060]  We urge people to keep an eye on the varieties that tend to go hot.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.060]  But right now we do not have a list of restricted varieties.
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:06.060]  That may happen in the future.
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:11.060]  We have to do a little more data collection on varieties.
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:12.060]  Wow.
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.060]  Yeah.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:17.060]  And the other one is how's it going with sampling agents?
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.060]  Have you talked to Chuck?
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:20.060]  Are there some?
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:22.060]  Is this going to be a problem this year?
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.160]  People finding sampling agents?
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.160]  Has it been applied?
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.160]  We certainly hope it's not going to be a problem.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:38.160]  We do have some people that have expressed an interest in the process of getting into the system.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:47.160]  And we hope that as the season, as it gets warmer and people start thinking more about being outdoors and growing things,
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.260]  That'll,
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:54.260]  the more people will come into the program.
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.260]  So a question came up in the chat.
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:59.260]  Is there a price cap on sampling costs?
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:02.260]  We will not be dictating the price.
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:03.260]  Okay.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:04.260]  So yeah,
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:06.260]  I talked to Chuck a little bit and it was like,
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:10.260]  it's like they're going to be private consultants and it's just a matter of competition.
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:11.260]  That one,
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:14.260]  one guy's charging 200 bucks.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.360]  The other guy's charging 400 bucks and they'll both do your area.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.360]  That's how it's going to work.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.360]  Right?
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.360]  Yep.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.360]  Yeah,
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.360]  I do.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.360]  There's a message here that Heather sent me.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.360]  So maybe I can address this.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:33.360]  Those who want to home grow under the MRTA provisions when allowed.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:42.360]  Will those who want to home grow under the MRTA provisions when allowed need to obtain a hemp license if they want to grow high CBD plants?
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:44.460]  That's interesting.
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.460]  You will need,
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:46.460]  if you're growing hemp,
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:48.460]  you need a license from us.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:49.460]  You can,
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:50.460]  we're in a,
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:45:00.460]  we're in a weird situation here where we are running a heavily regulated hemp program because we are following federal law and all the federal requirements.
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.460]  The marijuana side of things,
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.460]  it's federally illegal,
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.460]  but the state has chosen to,
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.460]  to allow growing of marijuana in the state.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.560]  So those two things are very,
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.560]  very separate.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.560]  So if you're going to grow hemp,
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.560]  you're,
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.560]  you've really,
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  you got to have the license from us.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:21.560]  That's interesting.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.560]  That's kind of a strange setup.
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:26.560]  Following up on that question.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:34.560]  If I want to grow hemp in my house for my own consumption,
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.560]  do I need a license?
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:38.660]  How many plants can I grow?
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:43.660]  You can't grow hemp in your house or in a residential setting,
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:44.660]  period.
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:46.660]  So that,
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:48.660]  that would negate that.
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.660]  If you want to,
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:56.660]  we don't have a restriction on the number of plants you can grow.
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:57.660]  However,
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.660]  you would have to,
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.660]  you couldn't be doing in a residential setting and,
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:01.660]  you know,
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:04.660]  in an area zone residential or within a home.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:11.760]  So I'm just checking the list.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.760]  If there's any more,
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:15.760]  I don't see any more questions,
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.760]  but Tim,
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.760]  you're going to stick around in case there's a little back and forth
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.760]  between Patrick or something comes up after Patrick presents.
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:24.760]  Right.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.760]  Cause the two of you are so hand in hand.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:27.760]  Sure.
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:28.760]  Yep.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:29.760]  Okay.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.760]  Wouldn't miss it.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:32.760]  So I'm going to.
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:33.860]  Patrick.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:37.860]  He's with the office of cannabis management prior.
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:41.860]  It was the department of health because as many of,
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:42.860]  you know,
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:43.860]  you know,
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:47.860]  marijuana medical marijuana was in department of health hemp was an egg
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:48.860]  of markets.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:52.860]  And now this office of cannabis management will take on medical
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:53.860]  marijuana,
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:58.860]  recreational marijuana and CBD processing and set distribution and
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.860]  sales,
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.960]  but not the growing portion.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:05.960]  Cause the growing portion is still hemp that sticks with ag and markets.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.960]  So if that doesn't have everybody confused yet,
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.960]  we'll just so we're gonna let Patrick go,
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:14.960]  Patrick,
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:15.960]  do you want me to play?
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:16.960]  Are you ready to share screen?
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.960]  Cause you have permission.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.960]  According to Kim,
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.960]  you've been given permission to share screen and you can just go ahead.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:24.960]  And.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.960]  Sure.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:26.960]  I can give it a go.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:27.960]  Sorry.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:28.960]  One sec.
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:31.060]  Hi,
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.060]  my name is Patrick McKeague.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:36.060]  I'm the first deputy director at the office of cannabis management.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.060]  I'm really excited to be here.
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:39.060]  Thank you.
[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.060]  Very quiet.
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:42.060]  We're putting up this opportunity.
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:47.060]  Hopefully we can be doing something like this soon in person.
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.060]  As it's been a couple of years,
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:51.060]  but nonetheless,
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:54.060]  very excited to be here today and be able to provide an update on the
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:56.160]  program in New York state.
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.160]  Before I kind of dive into that,
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.160]  I thought I'd just provide a brief background of myself.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:05.160]  I've been working on the cannabis file for the past four to five years in
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.160]  New York state government.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:09.160]  I started at the department of taxation and finance,
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:12.160]  looking at a lot of the projections and models to see.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:16.160]  How much tax revenue could New York state have to provide for cannabis
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.160]  development?
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:18.160]  And I'm really excited to be here.
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:21.260]  I've been working on the cannabis file for the past four to five years in
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:22.260]  New York state government.
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.260]  I started at the department of taxation and finance,
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.260]  looking at a lot of the projections and models to see.
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:29.260]  How much tax revenue could New York state bring in?
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:30.260]  If we did legalize.
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:33.260]  I then ended up spending a couple of years in the governor's office
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.260]  working on the legislation.
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.260]  That.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:38.260]  Later would become the marijuana regulation and taxation act.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:41.260]  And then I went over to the department of health.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:44.260]  Where I had an opportunity to be part of a team that helps stand up the
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.360]  program and work.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:46.360]  The medical cannabis.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360]  And then after the MRTA did pass.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  In March of 2021.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.360]  Everyone who was working at the department of health medical cannabis
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:00.360]  program.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:05.360]  I actually transitioned over to the new office of cannabis management and
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.360]  working on.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.360]  All three cannabis programs in New York state at large.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:16.460]  The program, the adult use program and the medical cannabis program.
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:20.460]  So it's been a really exciting opportunity to be able to participate
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:23.460]  in standing up a new agency and New York state government.
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:26.460]  I finally think we're at that point where,
[01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:27.460]  you know,
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:31.460]  a lot of the administrative stuff we have the foundation laid in terms
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:32.460]  of,
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:33.460]  you know,
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:34.460]  finding office space,
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:35.460]  buying furniture,
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:36.460]  hiring.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:39.460]  And so now we're really starting to focus on the cannabis program.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.560]  And so now we're really starting to focus on the policy development,
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.560]  which is the exciting part of the work.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:50.560]  And I'm hoping we'll be able to share a number of updates in the coming
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.560]  months.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.560]  So please,
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560]  you know,
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.560]  continue to follow the OCM website and I'm sure there'll be more
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:58.560]  information to come.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:02.560]  So here's the outline for what I want to talk about today.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:04.560]  First,
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.560]  just provide a brief overview of the cannabis program.
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:08.560]  So we're all on the same page.
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:11.660]  Then we'll provide some programmatic updates.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:12.660]  The first one here,
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:16.660]  I think you maybe have seen in the news recently just last week,
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:19.660]  governor Kathy Hockel signed legislation,
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:24.660]  authorizing the office of cannabis management to conditionally license
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:30.660]  previous hemp growers and processors in New York state to jumpstart the
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:31.660]  adult use markets.
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:36.660]  And then we also have some proposed regulations that are out for public
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.760]  comment right now that I can provide an overview for.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.760]  Then I'll write an update on our application process,
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.760]  going over some of the different license types and how to apply for a
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760]  cannabis hemp license.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:53.760]  And then just do a brief kind of timeline,
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.760]  next steps,
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.760]  and we'll have,
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:58.760]  be sure to leave time for some questions and answers.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.760]  So a brief legislative background on the cannabis hemp program.
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:09.860]  The cannabis hemp program officially started from a bill which passed in
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:17.860]  2019 and was later chaptered in 2020 that split the regulatory framework of
[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:21.860]  which agency has control over different aspects of hemp,
[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:24.860]  depending on what it's being sold for.
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:29.860]  So the cultivation of hemp remained under the purview of the department of
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:30.960]  agriculture markets.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:32.960]  And then the processing,
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:37.960]  manufacturing and retail sale of cannabinoid hemp moved over to the
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:40.960]  department of health in the medical marijuana program.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:45.960]  Now the reasoning for putting it into the medical marijuana program is
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:49.960]  because there is just so much overlap as it relates to the processing,
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:55.960]  manufacturing of cannabinoid hemp products and the processing and
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.960]  manufacturing of cannabis products.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:59.060]  After all,
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:03.060]  it's all the same plant and the only real difference between hemp and
[01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:06.060]  cannabis is the level of THC content.
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:09.060]  So what is cannabinoid hemp?
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:14.060]  Cannabinoid hemp is defined as any product that is used for its cannabinoid
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:19.060]  content like CBD for human consumption or topical application.
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:25.060]  We're not talking about hemp products or products derived from hemp that
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:30.160]  are using the seeds or fiber or hemp Cree or anything like that.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.160]  That does not fall under the purview of the cannabinoid hemp program.
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:39.160]  Really only looking for things that people are putting in their bodies or on
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:42.160]  their skin for their cannabinoid content.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.160]  Additionally,
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:48.160]  the program was very conscious to use the word cannabinoid rather than just
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.160]  calling it CBD.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:54.160]  While CBD is the most popular products you see on the market today,
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:53:00.160]  many of the products out there are starting to highlight the minor
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:05.160]  cannabinoids or terpenes in these cannabinoid or CBD products.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:11.160]  And we expect that trend to continue in the future as anyone who's been
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:17.160]  following this topic can see as it relates to Delta 8 or CBG or CBN
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.160]  products.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.160]  So it was consciously chosen to make the cannabinoid hemp program a little
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.160]  broader than just the CBD program.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:29.160]  So what are the objectives of the cannabinoid hemp program?
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:34.160]  The cannabinoid hemp program is designed to comprehensively regulate
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:38.160]  cannabinoid hemp products in New York State by providing clear rules for
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:40.160]  what is allowed and what is not allowed.
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:48.160]  One of the biggest problems or issues with hemp right now is that it exists
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:56.260]  in a bit of a gray area where the 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:01.260]  Controlled Substance Act and authorized the USDA to create regulations
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.260]  governing hemp cultivation.
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:09.260]  Meanwhile, you had all these State Department of Ag research programs
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:15.260]  authorizing people to grow hemp and develop products from it.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:20.360]  And as CBD and other cannabinoid hemp products became more popular, more
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:25.360]  and more hemp farmers and processors started focusing on CBD products
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.360]  and cannabinoid hemp products.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.360]  Immediately after the 2018 Farm Bill passed, the FDA came out with a
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:38.360]  statement and basically said, you know, I know there's a lot of interest
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.360]  in the CBD cannabinoid out there.
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:47.460]  However, we'd like to remind everyone that because of this drug exclusion rule
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:52.460]  that basically says any ingredient that is an active ingredient in a
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:56.460]  pharmaceutically approved product is not allowed to be added to food
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:57.460]  or beverage products.
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:04.460]  So CBD is part of a pharmaceutically approved drug called Epidiolex.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:10.460]  And because of that, the FDA has taken a position that CBD cannot be
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:15.560]  added to normal food or beverage products or in commerce, or they
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.560]  have regulatory jurisdiction over this.
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:23.560]  This has created a problem because obviously hemp-derived cannabinoid
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:27.560]  products are widely available from corner stores to your pharmacy
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  to online, yet there isn't really a clear regulatory framework for that.
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.560]  So the biggest objective of the cannabinoid hemp program is to try
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:42.660]  and provide some basic rules for what is allowed for the sale of these
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:43.660]  type of products.
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:47.660]  And then the second bullet here is really the big one.
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:51.660]  It's establishing consumer protections and quality control standards
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:54.660]  for these cannabinoid hemp products.
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:59.660]  And, you know, we really did not try to reinvent the wheel here in terms
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:01.660]  of where these requirements come in from.
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:05.660]  A lot of them pull from best practices in the food and beverage industry
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:09.760]  or the cannabis industry in terms of how to deal with things like THC
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:15.760]  and packaging and labeling and mandating that all of the processors
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:21.760]  in the cannabinoid hemp program achieve a good manufacturing practices
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:22.760]  audit.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:27.760]  And one of the reasons why we are mandating a GMB audit of a processor's
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:33.760]  facilities is because if this is legalized at the federal level, that
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:38.860]  is probably something that is going to also be authorized because it is
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:43.860]  a requirement that exists for most food, beverage, or dietary supplement
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:47.860]  products that are sold at grocery stores or normal commerce.
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:52.860]  And then the last goal here or objective of the program is to educate
[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:55.860]  and enforce against substandard products or disallowed forms of cannabinoid
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:57.860]  hemp products in the marketplace.
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:01.860]  As you can imagine, because of the way the market grew, there's a lot
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:07.960]  of disinformation out there in terms of what is hemp, what is Delta-8 THC.
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:13.960]  It's a whole new vocabulary and really requires a lot of education out
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:14.960]  there.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:17.960]  But also there's a role for the office to play to make sure dangerous
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:20.960]  and harmful products are not being sold.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.960]  So there are four license types under the cannabinoid hemp program.
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:34.060]  There are two processor licenses, one for extraction and manufacturing
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:37.060]  and one for manufacturing only.
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:42.060]  The extraction and manufacturing license is unique in that it allows
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:49.060]  the processor to take biomass or raw hemp and then extract it to create
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:54.060]  an intermediary product such as the isolate, a distillate, or a crude
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:59.060]  oil, which then can be used to manufacture a finished cannabinoid
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.160]  hemp product.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:06.160]  The manufacturing only license is available for a processor who is
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.160]  purchasing that intermediary product, that distillate or isolate, and
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.160]  then manufacturing a product from it.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:17.160]  So it just allows different opportunities for different business models
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.160]  to enter the program.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:25.160]  There's a couple more requirements on the extractor side just because
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:31.260]  some of the extractor techniques could require someone to get more code
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:36.260]  compliance or fire code safety depending on how they are extracted.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:40.260]  And then there's also a cannabinoid hemp distributor and a cannabinoid
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:42.260]  hemp retail license.
[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:49.260]  The distributor license is only applicable for processors or distributors
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:54.260]  who are selling cannabinoid hemp products manufactured outside of
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:58.360]  New York State and selling them to a New York State retailer.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:03.360]  And really the main reason for this license is to help the office with
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.360]  enforcement and compliance.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:10.360]  It's a lot easier to go after one distributor and say, hey, this product
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:14.360]  you're selling to 100 different retailers is not allowed versus trying
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:18.360]  to go to every single retailer and pulling products off the shelf or
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:21.360]  providing education, whatever it be.
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:25.460]  And then the retail license is really meant to be more of a registration.
[01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:28.460]  At this point, we're really trying to figure out who are selling these
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:32.460]  cannabinoid hemp products and providing them with information for things
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:35.460]  they should be looking for when they're sourcing these products.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:38.460]  There should be certain things on the packaging and the labeling.
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:40.460]  There should be test results.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:46.460]  And it's really at this point more of an educational license before,
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:52.560]  as this program is very still much in its early stages.
[01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:59.560]  So as I mentioned in the outline, last week Governor Kathy Hochul
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:04.560]  signed a new bill into law for conditional cultivators.
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:11.560]  This is a relatively novel idea as I do not believe any other state
[02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:13.560]  has pursued this.
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:17.660]  However, what the bill authorizes is it gives the Office of Cannabis
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:22.660]  Management the ability to license on previously authorized hemp
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:26.660]  growers from the Department of Agriculture and Markets to start
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:30.660]  growing cannabis for the upcoming adult use program.
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:36.660]  And so really the idea here is, you know, there's a handful of people
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:40.660]  in the state who have experience growing cannabis, which is the same
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:45.760]  as hemp if you're growing for high CBD content.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:51.760]  And because New York is in the Northeast and the growing season is
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.760]  relatively short, this legislation had to be passed now in order for
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:01.760]  any growers to be able to grow outside or in a greenhouse for the
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.760]  2020 growth season.
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:08.760]  So this program is really just all about trying to jumpstart the adult
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:14.860]  market and the office will be sharing more information soon.
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:21.860]  Now it's important to note that not all previously authorized hemp
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:25.860]  growers from the Department of Ag and Markets will be eligible for
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:27.860]  this conditional cultivator license.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:32.860]  The legislation sets out the following parameters in order for an
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:34.860]  applicant to be eligible to apply.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.960]  First, they must have been authorized to grow hemp under the
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:41.960]  Department of Ag and Markets Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.960]  Number two, they must be good standing with the Department of
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.960]  Agriculture and Markets.
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  Number three, they must have been authorized to grow cannabinoid or
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:56.960]  CBD hemp as opposed to growing hemp for seed or fiber.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:02.960]  Number four is they must have grown CBD hemp or cannabinoid hemp for
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:05.060]  seed or fiber.
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:09.060]  They must be able to grow out of the past four years, so that's between
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:13.060]  2018 and 2021, and be able to provide documentation to the office
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:15.060]  proving that.
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:21.060]  So I know at one time I think there was over 700 authorized hemp
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:23.060]  farmers in New York State.
[02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:27.060]  However, from harvest reports and some preliminary information from
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:31.060]  Ag and Markets, we know many of those people who were authorized to
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.160]  grow hemp didn't actually grow.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.160]  So this legislation is looking for cultivators who have experience
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.160]  actually growing hemp in New York State.
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.160]  And then lastly, the last kind of eligibility criteria is the
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:55.160]  applicant must be 51% owned by the entity or individual who had the
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.160]  hemp grower license.
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:01.260]  So there is of course a provision in place to make sure that someone
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:05.260]  is not flipping the license and making sure it goes to the people who
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:07.260]  have the experience growing hemp.
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:11.260]  So like I said, the office is working on developing guidance and
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.260]  hopes to be sharing more information soon.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:17.260]  There's actually some preliminary information up on our website now
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.260]  under cannabis.newyork.gov.
[02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:25.260]  I can provide that link to Mary at the end.
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:29.360]  But it includes an FAQ as well as a link to the legislation where I
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.360]  encourage folks to go check it out.
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.360]  And like I said, we hope to be sharing more information soon.
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.360]  So what does the conditional adult use cannabis cultivator license
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:45.360]  authorize?
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:51.360]  The license allows a licensee to grow up to one acre of canopy outdoors
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:55.460]  and 25,000 square feet of canopy in a greenhouse.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:59.460]  And a canopy is usually defined as the area that is actually plants
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:01.460]  that are flowering and growing.
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:05.460]  It does not include like storage areas or areas used for processing,
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:07.460]  harvesting, or trimming.
[02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:11.460]  It really is focused on the area where plants are actually planted.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:15.460]  And a cultivator can grow both outdoors and in a greenhouse.
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.560]  So they can be multiple grow locations.
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:21.560]  However, if they do choose to do that, the greenhouse grow cannot be
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:25.560]  more than 20,000 square feet and with a maximum of 30,000 square feet
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.560]  overall.
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:31.560]  And really, the real reasoning for why there's different square footage
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:35.560]  allowed for greenhouse grows versus outdoor grows is because the
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.560]  greenhouse grow is a lot smaller.
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:39.560]  So it's a lot more of a greenhouse grow.
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:41.560]  And so it's a lot more of a greenhouse grow.
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.660]  And the reason why there's different square footage allowed for
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:47.660]  greenhouse grows versus outdoor grows is because there's more ability
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:51.660]  for the cultivator to control the environment in a greenhouse grow.
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:55.660]  And thus, the idea is to try and make some parity in terms of output
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:59.660]  comparing the outdoor square footage and the greenhouse square footage.
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:05.660]  And the legislation does authorize a cultivator to use up to 20 artificial
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:07.660]  lights.
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:11.760]  Please be aware that the office does expect to be issuing guidance as
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:13.760]  it relates to lighting.
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:17.760]  We know that high intensity and some of the older lighting methods can
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:19.760]  be very energy intensive.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:23.760]  And we want to make sure that the growers are thinking about
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:25.760]  sustainability and environmental requirements.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:29.760]  So please be on the lookout for guidance as it relates to lighting.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:35.760]  The legislation will also authorize the cultivator to use up to 20
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:37.860]  artificial lights.
[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:41.860]  The legislation also authorizes the minimal processing, manufacturing,
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:45.860]  and distribution of cannabis flower products for cultivators.
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:49.860]  Please be aware that this does not include any extraction authorization
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:53.860]  and it's limited to cannabis flower products.
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:57.860]  That authorization does expire in June 1, 2023.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:01.860]  So if they wish to continue that activity, they would have to get a
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:03.860]  processor or distributor license.
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:05.960]  When those do become available.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:09.960]  And then lastly, this last kind of bullet here is really important.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:13.960]  The legislation mandates that the grower comply with all the program
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:17.960]  terms, conditions, regulations, and guidance set out by the Cannabis
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:21.960]  Control Board and the Office of Cannabis Management.
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:25.960]  So because of just the timing of this bill coming out kind of before
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:29.960]  the formal regulation package is finished from the Office of Cannabis
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:34.060]  Management, there's going to be a lot of attestations in terms and
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:38.060]  conditions that the growers are going to be saying that they will
[02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:42.060]  adhere to as they kind of launch this process.
[02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:46.060]  So like I said, we'll be sharing more information soon.
[02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:50.060]  And it's a really exciting idea to jumpstart the adult use industry.
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:54.060]  And as far as I'm aware, there's a lot of work that's going on
[02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:56.060]  with the adult use industry.
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:00.160]  And as far as I'm aware, I think we're the only state that has pursued
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:02.160]  this opportunity.
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:06.160]  So it'll be really interesting to see how it all plays out.
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:10.160]  I also wanted to touch upon some proposed regulations that are currently
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.160]  out for public comment with the Cannabis Enhancement Program right now.
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:18.160]  So on December 16th, the Cannabis Control Board voted to file some
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:22.160]  changes to the Cannabis Enhancement Program.
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:26.260]  The Cannabis Control Board voted to file some changes to the regulations.
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:30.260]  And the comment period actually ends March 6th or 7th.
[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:34.260]  So if you have any comments, you still have a couple days to get to the
[02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:36.260]  program.
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:40.260]  The best way to send comments is via email.
[02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:44.260]  And we have an email dedicated to that.
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:48.260]  It's called regulations at ocm.newyork.gov.
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:52.360]  There's also a link to these proposed regulations on our website.
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:56.360]  So a lot of these changes came out of comments we actually received
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:00.360]  during the last regulatory package.
[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:04.360]  And instead of reposting for another set of comment period, we decided
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:08.360]  to file those regulations and then address these changes as a separate
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:12.360]  standalone reg package.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:16.360]  So just quickly, it allows the public to make comments on the regulations
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:20.460]  Just quickly, it allows the milligram cap for cannabinoids
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:24.460]  in a dietary supplement product per serving
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:28.460]  to increase from 75 to 100 milligrams.
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:32.460]  It removes the requirement that cannabinoid products be shelf-stable.
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:36.460]  It increases the acceptable THC concentration
[02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:40.460]  of intermediary extract from 3% THC
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:44.460]  to 5% THC.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:48.560]  It allows some out-of-state manufacturers to emit certain warning labels
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:52.560]  particularly for products that are broad spectrum
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.560]  or isolate derived, so they do not contain any THC.
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:00.560]  It mandates a new definition
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.560]  for craft cannabis.
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:08.560]  Really the goal here is, you know, we've been hearing in the market
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.560]  that a lot of people have been calling
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:16.660]  Hey, sorry, that was me purposefully stopping.
[02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:20.660]  I unfortunately do have a hard
[02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:24.660]  stop at 2.30, so I wanted to
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:28.660]  open it up for at least some time for questions or comments if anyone has any.
[02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:32.660]  The last few slides, which just kind of
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:36.660]  walk through the application process and also share
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:40.660]  some information on how to best contact the Office of Cannabis Management.
[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:46.660]  I'll let others go.
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:50.660]  I know I have questions, but if others want to shoot theirs out.
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:57.720]  I don't hear anybody. I'm unmuting.
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:01.720]  The 8084, the new legislation you were just talking about,
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:05.720]  I saw the word distribution a lot, so are growers that
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:09.720]  get this conditional license going to be able to sell as well, or do they have to sell
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:13.720]  to a dispensary who also doesn't have a license yet?
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:17.820]  Correct. Yeah. So the way the cannabis law is structured
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:21.820]  is no, essentially, entity
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:25.820]  is allowed to have an interest in a
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:29.820]  retail tier and also the producer tier.
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:33.820]  This license would authorize them to cultivate
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:37.820]  to process adult-use flower products
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:41.820]  and distribute adult-use flower products to dispensaries
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:45.920]  that you correctly pointed out do not exist yet, but not to
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:49.920]  a customer, not a retail sale.
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.920]  The other big one is this
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:57.920]  is marijuana, that's the word I'm going to use,
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:01.920]  production. Even this conditional use,
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:05.920]  is it agriculture? Will it be?
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.920]  Can folks get their ag assessment when they
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:14.020]  plant it, things like that?
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:18.020]  That's a really great question, Mary.
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:22.020]  I had a town supervisor ask me yesterday, by the way.
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:26.020]  Yeah, and I know this comes up sometimes as it relates to
[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:30.020]  local zoning and where these places are zoned
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:34.020]  and particularly at locations that also do
[02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:38.020]  manufacturing and processing and grow at the same location.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:42.120]  I unfortunately do not have a good answer for you and probably need to connect with Tim
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:46.120]  and some folks over at Ag and Markets to discuss this in more detail.
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.120]  I know hemp was specifically added to the list of
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.120]  plants that are considered agricultural in the law
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:58.120]  and whether or not cannabis would be considered one
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.120]  I think is something we still need to iron out. Is that right, Tim?
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:06.120]  I think there was some legislation floating around that would do that and I'm not sure
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:10.220]  what the status of that bill is. I'll try to find out.
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:14.220]  Heather, I think she posed a question
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:18.220]  about CBD because the legislation
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:22.220]  specifically says processing and rules and regulations are
[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:26.220]  about CBD for human consumption.
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:30.220]  So does this include, because I know Ag and Markets
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:34.220]  gets involved, or Department of Health gets involved actually, in topical
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:38.320]  stuff like creams or Ag and Markets does pet food
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.320]  so all of those non, like I'm not putting in my mouth but it has
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.320]  CBD in it and has some sort of health thing.
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:50.320]  Who's doing that and does it have to follow all the same rules?
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:54.320]  Yeah, so it's kind of an odd definition but in the
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.320]  regs, human consumption includes
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:02.320]  topicals being applied on the skin. However, we excluded
[02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:06.420]  products that meet the federal's definition
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:10.420]  the FDA's definition of cosmetics. So if it's marketed
[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:14.420]  and it's not intended to have a purpose or effect
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:18.420]  on the body, so if someone's just putting some in eye cream and they're not saying
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:22.420]  this is going to cure your wrinkles or something like that, then that's
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:26.420]  fine. That doesn't need to be under a condaminated hemp program
[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:30.420]  however, if it is saying if you put this on it's going to cure your elbow
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:34.520]  and there's kind of like a medical thing behind
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:38.520]  it, then it does fall into the program.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:42.520]  The only other thing I'm just going to point out
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:46.520]  is that I noticed for out of state manufacturers
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:50.520]  they're allowed to omit something on their label
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.520]  so I'm taking an extension
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:58.520]  hat off maybe a little bit here and I know there's processors and growers
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:02.620]  wasn't the whole idea of a lot of this legislation was to level the playing field
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:06.620]  and so now to allow out of state manufacturers
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:10.620]  and I'm not finding fault with you, I'm just pointing out that the others on the
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:14.620]  this might want to do something about it and that now out of state
[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:18.620]  manufacturers don't have to follow particular rules that now in state do
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:22.620]  that makes the, that unlevels the playing field.
[02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:26.620]  Yeah, and actually that particular one
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:30.720]  it was previously we had it where out of state manufacturers
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:34.720]  were actually not able to do a certain
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:38.720]  label requirement. This actually leveled the playing field so it treats all
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:42.720]  processors the same and that change was
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:46.720]  there's a warning on the cannabinoid hemp labels that's required if it is a full spectrum
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:50.720]  product that includes trace amounts of THC however if they have
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:54.720]  a lab test and say that it's either from an isolate or a
[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:58.820]  broad spectrum product and it proves that there's no THC in it
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:02.820]  they then do not have to include that warning.
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:06.820]  But I'm so sorry I actually I literally have another presentation.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:10.820]  No problem, no problem. Thank you it was really nice to be here and I'm sure we'll talk soon.
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:14.820]  Thank you. Take care.
[02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:18.820]  Anybody else have any other questions for Tim or
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:22.820]  I can get them off to Patrick if
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.920]  you're working on some kind of a quick and easy
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:30.920]  bulleted version of this conditional permitting
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:34.920]  so that people can understand it better about what it does and does not
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.920]  provide producers. Hopefully that'll be ready in a few days
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:42.920]  and I can start getting it out and about. I do want to plug in
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:46.920]  put a plug in for the blog so NYHempExchange
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:50.920]  that's we called hemp exchange because as I mentioned
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:55.020]  earlier we I started it as folks could
[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:59.020]  buy and sell and sort of match make a little bit that hasn't
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:03.020]  been the most successful part. The more successful part has been the news
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:07.020]  section so when it's ready it'll be up on there
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:11.020]  and if you're not currently getting or if you haven't been to that
[02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:15.020]  blog and sort of signed up for it to get the push notifications when I throw something
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:19.020]  on there you might want to do that.
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:23.120]  Tim do you have any last
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:27.120]  anything because of
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.120]  I think I'm good I would just
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:35.120]  for any of you who know hemp growers that were in the program last year
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:39.120]  tell them they need a new license
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:43.120]  we've so far gotten I think I approved the 90th one today
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:47.120]  so out of 700 and some you have
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:51.220]  the highest we ever were at was 820 and I didn't expect
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:55.220]  to get back to that in the first year by any stretch but actually I'm a little bit
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:59.220]  ahead of where I thought we'd be right now but there are a lot of people who have
[02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:03.220]  not yet applied for their licenses who I'm fairly certain
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:07.220]  are going to want to continue to grow hemp
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:11.220]  so that's
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:15.220]  my only word of caution now is make sure you have a license before
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:19.320]  you're planting this year
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:23.320]  and it's going to take a while because like you mentioned there's background checks
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:27.320]  and other stuff that people have to do now they didn't have to do before
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:31.320]  that's a new wrinkle but I've had a couple people tell me just in the last week
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:35.320]  or so that they when they went to the post office to get their fingerprints
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:39.320]  I think they started the process before you know they said
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.320]  that the whatever has to go to the FBI they actually had their background
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:47.420]  checks in their email when they got home so
[02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:51.420]  the FBI was turning around really fast I assume those are people
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:55.420]  who didn't have a rap sheet or bad
[02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:59.420]  fingerprints I got a phone call from somebody who was having a lot of trouble with their fingerprint
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:03.420]  yeah I had somebody who said that
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:07.420]  their fingerprints just were not working out
[02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:11.420]  if you do decide to do a hard copy and mail it in to the FBI that's taking
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:15.520]  weeks so if you can do it electronically I would
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:19.520]  encourage that
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.520]  alright so if anybody else has any other questions I'm going to let
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.520]  everybody go I want to thank you for your extra 15 minutes
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:31.520]  of your time and don't forget there's a session evaluation link
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:39.740]  that Kim just put in the chat box
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:43.740]  this has been a production of Cornell University
