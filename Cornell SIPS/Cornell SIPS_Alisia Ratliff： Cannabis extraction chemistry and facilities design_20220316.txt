[00:00.120 --> 00:08.220]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.220 --> 00:15.500]  All right. Well, I want to welcome everyone to Hemp 411.
[00:15.500 --> 00:19.460]  We are, as always, so thrilled to be here and we're thrilled
[00:19.460 --> 00:23.040]  that you all made a little bit of time to come today.
[00:23.040 --> 00:24.760]  It's going to be a really good one.
[00:24.760 --> 00:27.060]  I can promise you that.
[00:27.060 --> 00:30.260]  My name is Zachary Stancel and I am
[00:30.260 --> 00:35.140]  the USDA Hemp Germ Plasm Curator.
[00:35.900 --> 00:40.420]  I wanted to tell you all a little bit about some of the work
[00:40.420 --> 00:43.020]  we're doing in beautiful Geneva,
[00:43.020 --> 00:47.420]  New York, which is snowing again today.
[00:47.420 --> 00:52.260]  My team and I run a hemp germ plasm repository.
[00:52.260 --> 00:54.500]  It's basically a seed bank for
[00:54.500 --> 00:59.940]  genetically and geographically diverse hemp varieties.
[01:00.940 --> 01:04.100]  Not unlike a library,
[01:04.100 --> 01:06.840]  we maintain this very unique,
[01:06.840 --> 01:09.740]  large collection of hemp materials.
[01:09.740 --> 01:14.020]  We study them, we keep them safe long-term in
[01:14.020 --> 01:18.420]  a minus 20 degrees Celsius cold storage area,
[01:18.420 --> 01:21.140]  and we enable scientists to
[01:21.140 --> 01:23.660]  use those seeds for their various projects.
[01:23.660 --> 01:25.980]  For example, breeding a different variety of
[01:25.980 --> 01:32.020]  fiber hemp for a unique environment,
[01:32.020 --> 01:35.180]  or understanding the genetic control
[01:35.180 --> 01:37.780]  of a certain trait of interest.
[01:37.780 --> 01:39.740]  Those are all kinds of people that would
[01:39.740 --> 01:43.300]  use our resources that we keep.
[01:43.300 --> 01:46.260]  Then secondly, we're trying to help
[01:46.260 --> 01:49.220]  preserve this genetic diversity long-term.
[01:49.220 --> 01:53.820]  Thinking in the scale of 100 years or more,
[01:53.820 --> 01:56.460]  can we preserve these cool varieties
[01:56.460 --> 01:58.860]  of hemp for future generations?
[01:58.860 --> 02:01.780]  It's a big job, it's exciting,
[02:01.780 --> 02:06.540]  and we're really just now starting it.
[02:07.020 --> 02:11.460]  We hope that this work will allow universities,
[02:11.460 --> 02:14.900]  farmers, hemp businesses,
[02:14.900 --> 02:21.300]  all to get a boost from having access to unique hemp.
[02:21.580 --> 02:23.820]  While doing this work,
[02:23.820 --> 02:26.940]  we were thrilled to meet so many awesome people
[02:26.940 --> 02:30.900]  in cannabis research and business.
[02:33.540 --> 02:35.860]  We thought it would be really fun to
[02:35.860 --> 02:39.900]  share their knowledge with all of you all.
[02:39.900 --> 02:43.620]  I do want to thank George,
[02:43.620 --> 02:45.700]  Tony, our wonderful interpreters,
[02:45.700 --> 02:48.300]  Kim, and Gemma for doing a lot of work.
[02:48.460 --> 02:52.740]  I'm just the person that talks here.
[02:52.740 --> 02:55.060]  But absolutely most of all,
[02:55.060 --> 02:57.900]  I wanted to thank Alicia Ratliff.
[02:57.900 --> 03:00.460]  I'm going to tell you a little bit about her
[03:00.460 --> 03:02.620]  and then let her take over.
[03:02.620 --> 03:08.420]  Alicia Ratliff is a fast-moving consumer goods executive
[03:08.420 --> 03:11.220]  with a background in chemical sciences
[03:11.220 --> 03:14.100]  and an interest in carbon sequestration,
[03:14.100 --> 03:16.860]  employed within the cannabis industry.
[03:17.100 --> 03:19.900]  With over 15 years of leadership experience
[03:19.900 --> 03:21.420]  across several sectors,
[03:21.420 --> 03:24.980]  Alicia uses a breadth of technical knowledge
[03:24.980 --> 03:26.540]  to build startup companies,
[03:26.540 --> 03:28.860]  develop strategic direction,
[03:28.860 --> 03:33.460]  and sustain the brand in new emerging markets.
[03:33.460 --> 03:36.380]  She is esteemed as a technical conference speaker,
[03:36.380 --> 03:39.220]  author, and ambitious entrepreneur
[03:39.220 --> 03:42.500]  who has become a technical subject matter expert,
[03:42.500 --> 03:46.300]  global thought leader, and motivational speaker.
[03:46.380 --> 03:50.140]  She strives to advise businesses on best practices,
[03:50.140 --> 03:53.260]  helping them avoid failing business models
[03:53.260 --> 03:55.660]  and implementing sustainable policies
[03:55.660 --> 03:59.300]  within an ever-changing regulatory environment
[03:59.300 --> 04:02.620]  and alternative medicines marketplace.
[04:02.620 --> 04:07.620]  So buckle up, and here she goes.
[04:09.260 --> 04:10.860]  Thank you so much, Zach.
[04:10.860 --> 04:12.140]  Thank you, Tony.
[04:12.140 --> 04:14.820]  I'd like to thank Dr. Grab
[04:14.820 --> 04:17.060]  and our relationship that we have
[04:17.060 --> 04:19.620]  for just introducing me to such a wonderful group of people
[04:19.620 --> 04:21.460]  that would invite me to be a part of something
[04:21.460 --> 04:22.940]  I think is so important and big.
[04:22.940 --> 04:24.820]  So hello, everyone.
[04:24.820 --> 04:28.420]  Thank you for taking your time out today to spend with me
[04:28.420 --> 04:31.260]  and just learning a little bit about extraction chemistry
[04:31.260 --> 04:32.100]  and facility design.
[04:32.100 --> 04:34.580]  So I'm gonna share my screen here
[04:34.580 --> 04:37.700]  and go right into the presentation.
[04:37.700 --> 04:42.140]  And hopefully we'll end up here with a few minutes for Q&A
[04:42.140 --> 04:43.340]  at the end of the presentation.
[04:43.340 --> 04:45.220]  So thank you so much.
[04:45.220 --> 04:47.980]  So today we're gonna talk about extraction chemistry
[04:47.980 --> 04:49.940]  and facility design.
[04:49.940 --> 04:53.380]  Specifically, when I was talking over my part
[04:53.380 --> 04:55.380]  in coming into the series,
[04:55.380 --> 04:56.780]  we were discussing some of the things
[04:56.780 --> 04:58.620]  that were of interest of some of the students
[04:58.620 --> 05:01.300]  over at Cornell University and in the Hemp Sciences Program.
[05:01.300 --> 05:03.740]  And one of those things that came about
[05:03.740 --> 05:07.140]  was learning how to build and think about
[05:07.140 --> 05:10.700]  and operate a successful canvas extraction company.
[05:10.700 --> 05:13.260]  So that is what I'm here to talk to you guys about
[05:14.180 --> 05:15.020]  this afternoon.
[05:15.020 --> 05:16.140]  Hopefully I can convey some things
[05:16.140 --> 05:20.620]  that will shed some light to how extraction chemistry
[05:20.620 --> 05:23.020]  is deeply intertwined with the facility design
[05:23.020 --> 05:25.140]  and success of a company.
[05:26.420 --> 05:29.820]  So just to give you a little bit of background about myself,
[05:29.820 --> 05:31.700]  my background is in chemistry.
[05:31.700 --> 05:33.980]  I graduated from the University of North Florida
[05:33.980 --> 05:35.260]  a few years back,
[05:35.260 --> 05:38.580]  and I have worked in the traditional laboratory setting
[05:38.580 --> 05:41.340]  for the past few years.
[05:41.340 --> 05:43.700]  I'm also a licensed project manager.
[05:43.700 --> 05:46.260]  I took on a role later on in my career
[05:46.260 --> 05:48.380]  to where I came outside of the laboratory
[05:48.380 --> 05:49.980]  and really started to develop
[05:49.980 --> 05:52.100]  a lot of the business acumen skills
[05:52.100 --> 05:54.580]  and just took an interest in understanding
[05:54.580 --> 05:57.860]  how the scientific aspect of testing
[05:57.860 --> 06:00.900]  was affecting scope of projects
[06:00.900 --> 06:02.620]  and different things like that.
[06:02.620 --> 06:04.700]  So I also took an interest
[06:04.700 --> 06:06.780]  in logistics and supply chain management.
[06:06.780 --> 06:11.260]  I'm professionally designated in those skill sets as well.
[06:12.060 --> 06:14.460]  I run a consulting firm with my husband,
[06:14.460 --> 06:16.540]  Victus Consulting Ventures,
[06:16.540 --> 06:19.460]  where we are industry consultants and advisors,
[06:19.460 --> 06:22.380]  basically helping new licensees in new markets
[06:22.380 --> 06:24.300]  really develop their strategic goals
[06:24.300 --> 06:26.780]  for building their infrastructure,
[06:26.780 --> 06:28.660]  understanding their product development
[06:28.660 --> 06:31.660]  and launching those operations in the new markets.
[06:31.660 --> 06:34.660]  I've also been a scientific executive in the industry
[06:34.660 --> 06:36.900]  where I've held multiple roles,
[06:36.900 --> 06:40.100]  gaining experience with startup companies in the US,
[06:40.100 --> 06:42.620]  the Canadian and the UK markets.
[06:45.630 --> 06:48.910]  So again, thank you to Cornell and the USDA
[06:48.910 --> 06:51.750]  for giving me the opportunity to be a part of this series.
[06:51.750 --> 06:55.710]  You guys have heard some amazing webinars now
[06:55.710 --> 06:58.310]  about cultivation, processing systems,
[06:58.310 --> 07:00.630]  and what I will be talking about,
[07:00.630 --> 07:02.550]  I think is a really great transition
[07:02.550 --> 07:04.910]  from all of those topics.
[07:04.910 --> 07:07.150]  So again, we're gonna touch on extraction chemistry
[07:07.150 --> 07:08.950]  and facility design,
[07:08.950 --> 07:12.190]  but specifically we're going to be discussing
[07:12.190 --> 07:14.710]  building a canvas manufacturing site,
[07:14.710 --> 07:15.710]  what goes into that,
[07:15.710 --> 07:19.030]  some of the considerations that you need to think about,
[07:19.030 --> 07:21.830]  looking at extraction facility design,
[07:21.830 --> 07:24.190]  looking at the extraction chemistry itself,
[07:24.190 --> 07:26.150]  some of the mechanisms and methodologies
[07:26.150 --> 07:29.430]  that are used in the industry commonly.
[07:29.430 --> 07:32.990]  Then we'll talk about product development
[07:32.990 --> 07:35.310]  and quality and compliance
[07:35.310 --> 07:39.670]  and how all of that ties into your manufacturing plant.
[07:39.670 --> 07:41.270]  Then we'll get into some of the products
[07:41.270 --> 07:43.350]  that can come out of these facilities,
[07:43.350 --> 07:45.510]  and then hopefully end in enough time
[07:45.510 --> 07:47.230]  to answer a few of your questions.
[07:48.670 --> 07:50.590]  All right, so let's jump in.
[07:50.590 --> 07:54.230]  So when you're building a canvas manufacturing facility,
[07:54.230 --> 07:56.710]  there's a lot of things that you need to think about
[07:56.710 --> 07:58.870]  when you go into the strategic planning phase,
[07:58.870 --> 08:02.310]  which should be the very beginning of the project.
[08:02.310 --> 08:04.870]  So one of the things that you have to decide early on
[08:05.430 --> 08:07.710]  is what is the level of compliance
[08:07.710 --> 08:09.950]  that I'm seeking as my standard?
[08:09.950 --> 08:12.550]  One of the things of why I say,
[08:12.550 --> 08:14.550]  what is the level that I'm seeking?
[08:14.550 --> 08:16.030]  When the industry got started,
[08:16.030 --> 08:17.350]  especially in newer markets,
[08:17.350 --> 08:20.870]  there isn't really a standardized level of compliance
[08:20.870 --> 08:22.790]  across the globe for this emerging industry.
[08:22.790 --> 08:26.750]  So a lot of states will have their own representation
[08:26.750 --> 08:29.030]  in legislation of what's considered compliant
[08:29.030 --> 08:30.070]  for your facility.
[08:30.070 --> 08:33.030]  So you need to have a good understanding of what that is,
[08:33.110 --> 08:35.070]  and then decide for yourself,
[08:35.070 --> 08:38.390]  am I going to essentially just meet state requirements,
[08:38.390 --> 08:39.750]  or will I be the person
[08:39.750 --> 08:42.230]  that's going to exceed those state requirements
[08:42.230 --> 08:43.950]  in order to impress
[08:43.950 --> 08:46.710]  and really differentiate my product in the market?
[08:46.710 --> 08:48.310]  So that's one of the first things.
[08:48.310 --> 08:49.350]  One of the second things is,
[08:49.350 --> 08:52.510]  what market am I targeting to start a business?
[08:52.510 --> 08:56.830]  Am I targeting a market that is flooded with vape products?
[08:56.830 --> 08:58.590]  Is that something that I wanna do?
[08:58.590 --> 09:00.990]  Do I wanna just be a cultivator
[09:00.990 --> 09:05.630]  that is generating B2B ingredients of cannabinoids,
[09:05.630 --> 09:07.190]  oils, and things like that?
[09:07.190 --> 09:08.670]  There's all these different ways
[09:08.670 --> 09:11.310]  that you can build an intermediary business
[09:11.310 --> 09:13.310]  like a manufacturing facility.
[09:13.310 --> 09:14.510]  You just have to figure out
[09:14.510 --> 09:16.070]  what it is you wanna do early on
[09:16.070 --> 09:18.190]  so you can plan those things out.
[09:18.190 --> 09:20.990]  What type of licensing am I seeking?
[09:20.990 --> 09:21.910]  This is very important.
[09:21.910 --> 09:23.910]  There's markets in the states
[09:23.910 --> 09:26.190]  that have vertical licensing
[09:26.190 --> 09:28.710]  where you have to own every single entity
[09:28.710 --> 09:30.910]  that's involved in producing the product
[09:30.910 --> 09:33.110]  and selling it from cultivation,
[09:33.110 --> 09:35.790]  manufacturing, dispensing,
[09:35.790 --> 09:37.630]  all of those different things fall under your umbrella
[09:37.630 --> 09:40.510]  versus some markets have a horizontal structure
[09:40.510 --> 09:44.790]  where you can essentially buy into just being a processor.
[09:44.790 --> 09:47.070]  And you have contracts set up with farms
[09:47.070 --> 09:49.070]  where you import your biomass,
[09:49.070 --> 09:51.310]  you extract, you create product,
[09:51.310 --> 09:53.510]  you white label, whatever it is you do there,
[09:53.510 --> 09:56.670]  and then you're able to distribute that into the market,
[09:56.670 --> 09:58.310]  whether that's through wholesale channels
[09:58.910 --> 10:00.350]  or a consumer brand.
[10:00.350 --> 10:02.470]  So there's different types of licenses.
[10:02.470 --> 10:04.230]  And so you have to understand
[10:04.230 --> 10:08.590]  what your license is giving you to operate in that market.
[10:08.590 --> 10:10.030]  And then some of the subsets
[10:10.030 --> 10:11.990]  of what you should really start to think about
[10:11.990 --> 10:15.550]  after those major points has been really decided
[10:15.550 --> 10:17.710]  is setting the bar for your budget,
[10:17.710 --> 10:21.150]  really understanding how much money do I need
[10:21.150 --> 10:24.510]  to fund the startup of this operation?
[10:24.510 --> 10:27.550]  How much money do I need to develop a product?
[10:27.590 --> 10:29.790]  How much money do I need to sustain operations
[10:29.790 --> 10:31.110]  for X amount of years
[10:31.110 --> 10:33.550]  before we think about our next fundraise?
[10:33.550 --> 10:35.710]  These are things that you need to take into account
[10:35.710 --> 10:38.310]  because it'll give you that operating runway.
[10:38.310 --> 10:40.270]  Understanding all of your considerations
[10:40.270 --> 10:42.190]  that go into building a site.
[10:42.190 --> 10:45.470]  We're gonna discuss these in detail here in a little bit.
[10:45.470 --> 10:47.790]  Being honest with yourself and realistic,
[10:47.790 --> 10:50.350]  I have encountered multiple companies
[10:50.350 --> 10:51.830]  that come into the canvas industry
[10:51.830 --> 10:53.390]  with just dollar signs in their eyes
[10:53.390 --> 10:56.550]  and understanding that this is gonna be keys
[10:56.550 --> 11:00.630]  given to them to unlock revenue in the billions.
[11:00.630 --> 11:02.230]  But you have to be realistic
[11:02.230 --> 11:04.230]  in what goes on in this industry
[11:04.230 --> 11:06.550]  as far as the research and development that goes on
[11:06.550 --> 11:07.950]  in the product development,
[11:07.950 --> 11:11.550]  optimization of processes, the training of staff,
[11:11.550 --> 11:13.510]  just different regulatory changes
[11:13.510 --> 11:15.990]  that will affect what you do as a company.
[11:15.990 --> 11:18.310]  So these things you have to take into account.
[11:18.310 --> 11:21.670]  And finally, know the impacts that your investment
[11:21.670 --> 11:24.790]  are gonna have to the operation and the products overall.
[11:27.550 --> 11:30.150]  So this is a slide that I really love to show
[11:30.150 --> 11:32.830]  because it just gives an average of budgets
[11:32.830 --> 11:36.070]  and budgetary concerns and just having cost considerations
[11:36.070 --> 11:38.230]  at the beginning of your planning phase.
[11:38.230 --> 11:41.030]  The assumption that I used here when I built this
[11:41.030 --> 11:42.870]  was 2000 square foot,
[11:42.870 --> 11:45.790]  a horizontally licensed manufacturing facility
[11:45.790 --> 11:49.150]  that operated using CO2 extraction technology.
[11:49.150 --> 11:51.590]  So when you're building up your budget of the project
[11:51.590 --> 11:56.030]  and what you're gonna need to get this thing operational,
[11:56.190 --> 11:57.310]  then you have to look at,
[11:57.310 --> 11:59.670]  okay, I've gotta get a property and building.
[11:59.670 --> 12:02.510]  I've gotta have some sort of planning and design strategy
[12:02.510 --> 12:07.390]  that may involve a team or hiring startup founders.
[12:07.390 --> 12:09.550]  I need equipment to produce this product.
[12:09.550 --> 12:12.390]  I'm going to need software to stay compliant
[12:12.390 --> 12:15.150]  and show transparent results
[12:15.150 --> 12:17.910]  of what we're doing at our facility to the state.
[12:17.910 --> 12:21.430]  I'm gonna have technicians or employees.
[12:21.430 --> 12:22.870]  I'm gonna have operating costs.
[12:22.870 --> 12:25.150]  Your electrical, your cooling, water.
[12:25.150 --> 12:27.990]  So all of those things need to go into the considerations
[12:27.990 --> 12:31.670]  of what is the cost of just the build out
[12:31.670 --> 12:35.510]  of the infrastructure to be able to produce the product.
[12:38.150 --> 12:40.070]  Some of the next things that you need to think about
[12:40.070 --> 12:41.710]  with facility design considerations
[12:41.710 --> 12:43.630]  are gonna be the building itself
[12:43.630 --> 12:46.150]  and the materials that go into the building.
[12:46.150 --> 12:49.110]  Am I going to construct this from ground zero
[12:49.110 --> 12:53.670]  or am I going to buy a preexisting building and retrofit
[12:53.670 --> 12:56.590]  and make sure that it's the appropriate environments
[12:56.590 --> 12:59.150]  for what I would be doing in those rooms?
[12:59.150 --> 13:01.030]  Those are things that you have to take into account
[13:01.030 --> 13:02.710]  because they're gonna affect your budget
[13:02.710 --> 13:04.670]  and your timeline as well.
[13:04.670 --> 13:06.150]  Facility square footage.
[13:06.150 --> 13:08.390]  This is something that sometimes people fail
[13:08.390 --> 13:10.470]  to consider future proofing.
[13:10.470 --> 13:13.750]  So you may have a predictable facility square footage
[13:13.750 --> 13:15.430]  of what you foresee,
[13:15.430 --> 13:19.430]  or you may have a preexisting plot of land
[13:19.430 --> 13:20.590]  and building that you're using
[13:20.590 --> 13:23.030]  that you're pretty much married to.
[13:23.030 --> 13:24.590]  However, I think you should consider
[13:24.590 --> 13:27.670]  the facility square footage for success.
[13:27.670 --> 13:30.590]  Plan to be successful, plan to have expansion,
[13:30.590 --> 13:33.470]  plan to add different revenue streams
[13:33.470 --> 13:35.350]  and activities to your facility.
[13:35.350 --> 13:37.910]  I think those things are important in the mindset
[13:37.910 --> 13:39.790]  of just building a successful business.
[13:39.790 --> 13:43.670]  So definitely consider future proofing your infrastructure
[13:43.670 --> 13:45.430]  with the facility square footage.
[13:45.430 --> 13:48.590]  Also, you need to consider the electrical requirements
[13:48.590 --> 13:50.670]  from the equipment that you'll be placing,
[13:50.710 --> 13:55.710]  the plumbing, the HVAC for being able to circulate the vapors
[13:55.750 --> 13:57.830]  and mitigate odors.
[13:57.830 --> 13:59.950]  These things need to be taken into consideration.
[13:59.950 --> 14:02.830]  And especially your location
[14:02.830 --> 14:04.950]  of where you're deciding to build,
[14:04.950 --> 14:07.510]  you have to look at the accessibility as well
[14:07.510 --> 14:10.270]  of these outputs that are gonna be going
[14:10.270 --> 14:12.550]  into your facility design.
[14:12.550 --> 14:15.830]  So do I have access to the appropriate electrical
[14:15.830 --> 14:17.910]  that I need to run the facility?
[14:17.910 --> 14:20.150]  Do I have access to plumbing?
[14:20.150 --> 14:21.590]  All these different things have to go
[14:21.590 --> 14:23.310]  into your decision-making.
[14:23.310 --> 14:25.830]  And finally, your zoning.
[14:25.830 --> 14:30.070]  Where can I build this facility and stay within compliance?
[14:30.070 --> 14:34.110]  Usually each state market has its own spiel
[14:34.110 --> 14:35.830]  on where you can be located,
[14:35.830 --> 14:38.390]  whether that's a thousand feet outside of school zones,
[14:38.390 --> 14:40.590]  parks, where children would be.
[14:40.590 --> 14:42.390]  So know your municipality,
[14:42.390 --> 14:44.230]  know where you're gonna be building
[14:44.230 --> 14:46.510]  so that you don't have to waste time
[14:46.510 --> 14:47.830]  in remediation of a site.
[14:50.420 --> 14:53.580]  Also another consideration in facility design,
[14:53.580 --> 14:57.180]  especially if you're horizontally licensed as a processor,
[14:57.180 --> 14:59.820]  is thinking about your compliance strategy.
[14:59.820 --> 15:02.540]  Knowing that you have a set of standards set out
[15:02.540 --> 15:04.580]  by the state that you have to stay compliant to
[15:04.580 --> 15:05.820]  in order to operate,
[15:05.820 --> 15:08.420]  you definitely should think about your testing strategy.
[15:08.420 --> 15:10.540]  How am I going to ensure this compliance
[15:10.540 --> 15:13.060]  and be able to relate and report this to the state
[15:13.060 --> 15:16.220]  or to the government agency that's covering me?
[15:16.220 --> 15:18.300]  So you definitely wanna think about that.
[15:18.300 --> 15:20.100]  What is your strategy?
[15:20.100 --> 15:23.020]  Are you going to be doing in-house testing
[15:23.020 --> 15:25.020]  or will you have third-party testing?
[15:25.020 --> 15:27.060]  I think it's important to do a cost analysis.
[15:27.060 --> 15:29.460]  Sometimes it may be a little bit more effective
[15:29.460 --> 15:31.220]  to send your samples out
[15:31.220 --> 15:33.300]  if you don't have a high traffic of sending samples
[15:33.300 --> 15:34.780]  to an analytical testing lab
[15:34.780 --> 15:37.300]  and you can afford the turnaround times.
[15:37.300 --> 15:38.740]  But then in other cases,
[15:38.740 --> 15:42.380]  it's best to have your own in-house capabilities,
[15:42.380 --> 15:45.660]  even if it's as small as just having an HPLC
[15:45.660 --> 15:47.500]  to be able to have eyes on
[15:47.540 --> 15:50.540]  what is actually the composition of the product.
[15:50.540 --> 15:51.740]  What are some of the test methods
[15:51.740 --> 15:54.820]  that are needed in the facility to support production?
[15:54.820 --> 15:57.100]  You might need to have some sort of method
[15:57.100 --> 15:59.740]  to test the optimization of what you're doing.
[15:59.740 --> 16:01.980]  Are you efficiently extracting the material?
[16:01.980 --> 16:03.380]  Are you wasting?
[16:03.380 --> 16:05.340]  So these are things that you have to consider
[16:05.340 --> 16:08.660]  and also consider what that's gonna do to your budget
[16:08.660 --> 16:13.060]  and also to the people that will be involved in the project.
[16:13.060 --> 16:16.740]  Have you considered specific technical laboratory staff?
[16:16.740 --> 16:18.860]  So these are things that also should be considered
[16:18.860 --> 16:20.580]  going into your facility design.
[16:24.050 --> 16:25.970]  This is extremely important to me.
[16:25.970 --> 16:27.490]  Growing up in laboratories
[16:27.490 --> 16:29.130]  and working for traditional laboratories,
[16:29.130 --> 16:32.730]  something that is very near and dear to me is safety.
[16:32.730 --> 16:36.330]  It's pretty much like knowing the right hand of me.
[16:36.330 --> 16:39.530]  You have to regard safety of everyone involved,
[16:39.530 --> 16:41.530]  whether that's the consumer on the backend
[16:41.530 --> 16:44.050]  or the employee that's producing your product.
[16:44.050 --> 16:46.890]  So when you're talking about your design of your facility
[16:46.890 --> 16:48.570]  and building this manufacturing facility,
[16:49.370 --> 16:51.810]  you have to consider your extraction technology
[16:51.810 --> 16:54.570]  and what you'll be doing to generate the oils
[16:54.570 --> 16:56.050]  out of the plants.
[16:56.050 --> 16:58.450]  Are you gonna be using hydrocarbon extraction?
[16:58.450 --> 17:01.810]  If you are, then now you have to build your facility
[17:01.810 --> 17:04.050]  to a C1D1 environment,
[17:04.050 --> 17:07.890]  which is a class one division one solvent,
[17:07.890 --> 17:10.130]  meaning that it's highly explosive.
[17:10.130 --> 17:12.050]  So there's other considerations,
[17:12.050 --> 17:15.250]  other types of protocols that have to be put in place
[17:15.250 --> 17:17.770]  to be able to mitigate against an incident
[17:17.770 --> 17:20.290]  and where there would be an explosion.
[17:20.290 --> 17:22.130]  So that's a safety consideration.
[17:22.130 --> 17:26.610]  Also PPE, what sort of PPE am I going to mandate
[17:26.610 --> 17:28.650]  in my facility to not only adhere
[17:28.650 --> 17:31.210]  to compliance of safety of product,
[17:31.210 --> 17:33.490]  but also to keep my employees safe?
[17:33.490 --> 17:37.050]  If they're operating a CO2 extractor,
[17:37.050 --> 17:40.250]  do they have hearing protection for the pumps?
[17:40.250 --> 17:41.850]  Do they have safety goggles
[17:41.850 --> 17:44.290]  if they're operating a distillation apparatus?
[17:44.290 --> 17:46.890]  So these things you have to consider.
[17:46.930 --> 17:51.010]  Also the environment itself and sanitizing the environment.
[17:51.010 --> 17:53.290]  How are you gonna control the environment?
[17:53.290 --> 17:55.370]  How are you gonna handle waste that's generated?
[17:55.370 --> 17:57.770]  You'll have spent biomass that you have to destroy.
[17:57.770 --> 18:02.410]  You'll have oil that may somehow pick up contamination
[18:02.410 --> 18:04.410]  that you have to destroy or mediate.
[18:04.410 --> 18:05.890]  How are you gonna handle this waste?
[18:05.890 --> 18:07.970]  Who are you gonna partner with to destroy it?
[18:07.970 --> 18:09.730]  And also chemical storage.
[18:09.730 --> 18:12.050]  Since it is a processing facility,
[18:12.050 --> 18:13.770]  sometimes there's chemicals involved
[18:13.770 --> 18:17.170]  that could be toxic to the environment or to people.
[18:17.170 --> 18:18.810]  So you have to think about the storage
[18:18.810 --> 18:21.650]  and also disposal and management of chemicals as well.
[18:24.170 --> 18:27.250]  And something that we do need to touch on now,
[18:27.250 --> 18:28.970]  I think that's so much more prevalent
[18:28.970 --> 18:30.770]  than it was a decade ago,
[18:30.770 --> 18:33.050]  is the conversation around climate change
[18:33.050 --> 18:37.930]  and really starting to work those details of sustainability
[18:37.930 --> 18:42.490]  and reversing a carbon impact into the design of a facility.
[18:42.490 --> 18:45.410]  Some of the data that has come out from mature markets
[18:45.410 --> 18:48.010]  in California and Colorado have shown
[18:48.010 --> 18:50.530]  that manufacturing facilities and extraction plants
[18:50.530 --> 18:52.770]  have a very high energy demand.
[18:52.770 --> 18:54.770]  They can have a high carbon emission rate
[18:54.770 --> 18:56.810]  or a large carbon footprint
[18:56.810 --> 18:59.690]  and also generate large amounts of waste.
[18:59.690 --> 19:02.690]  So I think it's important that we think about
[19:02.690 --> 19:05.130]  some of the things that we can implement
[19:05.130 --> 19:07.210]  into future facilities to be able to mitigate
[19:07.210 --> 19:08.650]  some of these factors
[19:08.650 --> 19:12.250]  and drive a net zero strategy for the business.
[19:15.660 --> 19:17.980]  So kind of pivoting here
[19:17.980 --> 19:20.860]  and just kind of understanding chemistry
[19:20.860 --> 19:23.340]  and cannabinoid extraction chemistry,
[19:23.340 --> 19:26.980]  I like to kind of take it back to the historical terms
[19:26.980 --> 19:31.020]  and what things were back in the ancient times.
[19:31.020 --> 19:33.500]  So what is botanical extraction?
[19:33.500 --> 19:37.780]  Botanical extraction is placing a solid in a solvent
[19:37.780 --> 19:41.340]  in order to remove soluble, dissolvable components.
[19:41.340 --> 19:43.580]  So we've seen this across the industry
[19:43.780 --> 19:47.060]  in multiple methods and techniques and pieces of equipment,
[19:47.060 --> 19:50.060]  which we'll talk about here in later slides.
[19:50.060 --> 19:53.900]  Plants, they've been found historically over centuries
[19:53.900 --> 19:56.340]  to provide therapeutic properties.
[19:56.340 --> 20:00.500]  So a lot of why botanicals have started to become extracts
[20:00.500 --> 20:03.380]  was to dissolve these plants in solutions
[20:03.380 --> 20:07.540]  to concentrate those properties in the compounds
[20:07.540 --> 20:09.300]  that we were extracting out,
[20:09.300 --> 20:12.420]  to separate those medicinal analytes from the plant matrix
[20:12.420 --> 20:15.780]  and really develop further drugs.
[20:15.780 --> 20:17.540]  So I think it's quite interesting
[20:17.540 --> 20:19.380]  that the natural extracts have been used
[20:19.380 --> 20:22.660]  as active ingredients in both pharmaceutical applications,
[20:22.660 --> 20:25.820]  but also cosmetics and wellness products
[20:25.820 --> 20:26.980]  for thousands of years
[20:26.980 --> 20:29.860]  before we've even come to the point we're at now.
[20:33.060 --> 20:34.940]  So some of the things that you have to think about
[20:34.940 --> 20:37.820]  when you talk about a manufacturing facility
[20:37.820 --> 20:39.700]  and extraction facility
[20:39.700 --> 20:41.940]  is the extraction chemistry itself.
[20:41.940 --> 20:44.900]  The process of separating a substance from a matrix
[20:44.900 --> 20:47.420]  is the definition of extraction.
[20:47.420 --> 20:49.580]  There are several types of extraction mechanisms
[20:49.580 --> 20:52.900]  that can be used to facilitate this process.
[20:52.900 --> 20:55.260]  You have liquid-liquid extraction,
[20:55.260 --> 20:58.540]  solid phase extraction, acid-base extraction,
[20:58.540 --> 21:01.180]  and also supercritical fluid extraction.
[21:01.180 --> 21:03.020]  Specifically, two of these mechanisms
[21:03.020 --> 21:05.100]  are very common in this industry,
[21:05.100 --> 21:07.980]  and we'll discuss those here in a little bit.
[21:10.890 --> 21:13.770]  So here's some of the common methodologies
[21:13.770 --> 21:17.250]  that are used in the cannabis and hemp industry.
[21:17.250 --> 21:19.330]  You have the hydrocarbon extraction,
[21:19.330 --> 21:22.770]  which is using a butane or a propane as a solvent.
[21:22.770 --> 21:24.130]  This is extremely popular.
[21:24.130 --> 21:28.370]  It was first regarded as extremely unsafe and very dangerous
[21:28.370 --> 21:31.530]  due to its popularity in the West Coast very early on
[21:31.530 --> 21:33.330]  when the industry was growing.
[21:33.330 --> 21:35.810]  However, we've become very sophisticated.
[21:35.810 --> 21:38.490]  The manufacturers of closed-loop systems
[21:38.890 --> 21:40.530]  have become very sophisticated
[21:40.530 --> 21:43.130]  in how butane is stored, handled,
[21:43.130 --> 21:46.930]  and used within the extraction process
[21:46.930 --> 21:49.210]  that has made it a lot more safe.
[21:49.210 --> 21:51.370]  It has its advantages in the industry
[21:51.370 --> 21:54.930]  as being a solvent that is highly selective
[21:54.930 --> 21:58.890]  in bringing out the terpenes, is able to retain terpenes.
[21:58.890 --> 22:01.530]  It's kind of like a low and slow extraction.
[22:01.530 --> 22:05.210]  So it's, oh, excuse me, it's a low extraction
[22:05.210 --> 22:08.130]  as far as boiling points and things like that.
[22:08.650 --> 22:11.530]  So you're able to increase your runtimes
[22:11.530 --> 22:13.890]  and you're able to increase your yields.
[22:13.890 --> 22:16.410]  So this definitely has its place in the industry.
[22:16.410 --> 22:18.770]  And I like seeing the innovation and automation
[22:18.770 --> 22:21.250]  that's been coming about with the equipment.
[22:21.250 --> 22:25.610]  Supercritical CO2, this is not new technology.
[22:25.610 --> 22:28.770]  It's been used for many years with distillation
[22:28.770 --> 22:31.930]  and removing ingredients from botanicals.
[22:31.930 --> 22:35.410]  But supercritical CO2 is very good at selectivity
[22:35.410 --> 22:37.130]  and also it's a natural solvent.
[22:37.130 --> 22:39.770]  So when it's being purged,
[22:39.770 --> 22:41.450]  it's essentially like effervescing
[22:41.450 --> 22:42.850]  into the atmosphere safely.
[22:42.850 --> 22:47.410]  So it has its advantages with the safety aspect
[22:47.410 --> 22:50.610]  and the component of purgeability out of the product.
[22:50.610 --> 22:52.890]  Definitely a high CapEx cost in equipment,
[22:52.890 --> 22:56.130]  but with a lot more manufacturers starting to come online,
[22:56.130 --> 22:58.130]  it's starting to drive that cost down
[22:58.130 --> 23:00.130]  to a more reasonable state.
[23:00.130 --> 23:01.890]  You do have ethanol extraction as well.
[23:01.890 --> 23:04.290]  Ethanol extraction is interesting because as a solvent,
[23:04.330 --> 23:07.730]  it has the ability to be both polar and non-polar.
[23:07.730 --> 23:11.730]  So it can extract essentially anything from the plant.
[23:11.730 --> 23:14.530]  It does have its disadvantages in that you have
[23:14.530 --> 23:17.850]  quite a bit of post-processing on the backend of the oils
[23:17.850 --> 23:21.250]  from just different less desirable components and compounds
[23:21.250 --> 23:23.610]  that you don't want in your final product.
[23:23.610 --> 23:27.370]  But it definitely has its place in being able to extract
[23:27.370 --> 23:32.370]  very large amounts of hemp and cannabis at very fast rates.
[23:32.410 --> 23:34.690]  And then you have ice water extractions.
[23:34.690 --> 23:37.090]  This is commonly known as your solventless extractions
[23:37.090 --> 23:38.050]  in the industry.
[23:38.050 --> 23:40.330]  Although from a chemical standpoint,
[23:40.330 --> 23:43.570]  it would be just less appropriate for me to refer
[23:43.570 --> 23:46.690]  to ice water extractions as solventless
[23:46.690 --> 23:48.330]  because water is a solvent.
[23:48.330 --> 23:51.090]  However, these are becoming much more popular as well
[23:51.090 --> 23:54.530]  because of the inherent dangers and risks
[23:54.530 --> 23:58.050]  of residual solvents in products.
[23:58.050 --> 24:01.050]  So the consumers have started to show an interest
[24:01.050 --> 24:05.490]  in the craft product production of concentrates
[24:05.490 --> 24:09.010]  through using an ice water extraction and pressing.
[24:09.010 --> 24:11.050]  So that is becoming a lot more popular
[24:11.050 --> 24:12.850]  and it's also becoming popular in the fact
[24:12.850 --> 24:15.570]  that it drives the cost of construction down
[24:15.570 --> 24:17.170]  because there's no specific environment
[24:17.170 --> 24:20.250]  that you have to work within as far as safety regulations go.
[24:20.250 --> 24:23.810]  And it's also very inexpensive to outfit.
[24:23.810 --> 24:27.530]  The kit is very inexpensive compared to some of the costs
[24:27.530 --> 24:30.610]  of like your supercritical CO2 fluid equipment.
[24:31.490 --> 24:33.610]  This is definitely something that's gaining a lot
[24:33.610 --> 24:36.490]  of popularity in the industry.
[24:39.050 --> 24:43.410]  So just kind of coming out of the extraction piece,
[24:43.410 --> 24:46.090]  that's just the beginning of the manufacturing plant.
[24:46.090 --> 24:49.290]  Now you have to think of how am I going to develop
[24:49.290 --> 24:52.090]  and produce all of the products in my portfolio?
[24:52.090 --> 24:56.090]  Am I producing vape cartridges, tincture oils, edibles,
[24:56.090 --> 24:58.730]  whatever that looks like, you have a process.
[24:58.730 --> 25:00.410]  So I like to show this process flow
[25:01.210 --> 25:03.330]  because this is going to affect your budget
[25:03.330 --> 25:05.170]  with ancillary equipment
[25:05.170 --> 25:09.050]  and subsequent manufacturing equipment, software,
[25:09.050 --> 25:10.570]  just all sorts of different things.
[25:10.570 --> 25:13.850]  So you have to think of the process of having the biomass
[25:13.850 --> 25:16.250]  and the contracts set up in place,
[25:16.250 --> 25:19.210]  having your extraction technology.
[25:19.210 --> 25:20.370]  How are you going to winterize?
[25:20.370 --> 25:22.650]  What is your strategy for winterization?
[25:22.650 --> 25:24.450]  How are you going to filter and de-wax
[25:24.450 --> 25:26.650]  if you're using ethanol extraction?
[25:26.650 --> 25:29.170]  De-carboxylation to activate the THC
[25:29.170 --> 25:30.930]  in your cannabis products.
[25:30.930 --> 25:33.810]  And then finally, how are you further concentrating
[25:33.810 --> 25:37.170]  or isolating products if you're an ingredient manufacturer?
[25:37.170 --> 25:40.690]  So these are things that you have to be cognizant of
[25:40.690 --> 25:43.290]  when you're thinking about your sellable product
[25:43.290 --> 25:44.130]  to the market.
[25:47.760 --> 25:51.280]  So talking about the products now being produced
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.840]  in your manufacturing facility,
[25:52.840 --> 25:55.440]  there's a quality threshold and a product specification
[25:55.440 --> 25:57.760]  that's put out through the state market
[25:57.760 --> 25:58.600]  that you're operating in
[25:58.600 --> 26:00.720]  or whatever country you're operating in.
[26:00.760 --> 26:02.880]  So there's regulatory compliance considerations
[26:02.880 --> 26:05.240]  that are now starting to bring their way
[26:05.240 --> 26:07.040]  into the design of the facility.
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.840]  What is your testing program?
[26:08.840 --> 26:11.200]  Are you going to have that internal testing program
[26:11.200 --> 26:13.320]  where you have in-house capabilities
[26:13.320 --> 26:15.840]  that are just confirmed and checked by a third party?
[26:15.840 --> 26:18.400]  Or will you be doing everything externally
[26:18.400 --> 26:20.520]  through a third party partner?
[26:20.520 --> 26:21.960]  That's something that you have to consider
[26:21.960 --> 26:25.040]  because it will affect your budget and your personnel.
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.160]  Also GDP, making sure that you communicate
[26:28.160 --> 26:31.120]  and put in place good documentation practices
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.560]  all across the organization.
[26:32.560 --> 26:34.080]  This is the only way that you'll be able
[26:34.080 --> 26:36.800]  to really check the pulse of how the business is doing
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.240]  once you're operating and able to find those areas
[26:40.240 --> 26:41.840]  that you can improve, optimize
[26:41.840 --> 26:45.240]  and really shave down waste generation.
[26:45.240 --> 26:46.600]  Your equipment materials.
[26:46.600 --> 26:50.840]  This plays a role in being able to satisfy a food safety
[26:50.840 --> 26:54.480]  or GMP sort of standard, depending on what market you're in.
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.960]  So you definitely want to look at the equipment materials
[26:56.960 --> 26:59.520]  that are in contact with your product.
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.000]  Again, going back to environmental controls and sanitation.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.880]  How am I sanitizing the environment between batches,
[27:05.880 --> 27:08.760]  between days and crews?
[27:08.760 --> 27:10.720]  You need to make sure that you have those things
[27:10.720 --> 27:11.960]  in place as well.
[27:11.960 --> 27:13.640]  And optimizing your processes.
[27:13.640 --> 27:14.720]  How are you going to do that?
[27:14.720 --> 27:15.920]  Are you going to scale up
[27:15.920 --> 27:18.640]  and have more pieces of equipment and expand?
[27:18.640 --> 27:21.240]  Are you going to automate processes?
[27:21.240 --> 27:23.840]  These are things that will also future-proof your business
[27:23.840 --> 27:26.320]  for plans of expansion.
[27:29.310 --> 27:32.230]  So why is testing needed in the canvas industry?
[27:32.230 --> 27:33.910]  Well, one of the reasons why testing is needed
[27:33.910 --> 27:35.990]  in the industry is first and foremost
[27:35.990 --> 27:39.790]  to test the chemical makeup of the material of the product.
[27:39.790 --> 27:42.710]  This is something that HPLC has been really great
[27:42.710 --> 27:46.030]  at achieving with, you know, cannabinoid potency methods
[27:46.030 --> 27:48.070]  being developed from multiple manufacturers
[27:48.070 --> 27:50.230]  as well as product manufacturers.
[27:50.230 --> 27:54.190]  So you definitely want to have testing that's involved
[27:54.190 --> 27:56.350]  at your facility so that you can just test your products
[27:56.350 --> 27:58.790]  and see what's in it and where you're at.
[27:58.790 --> 28:01.790]  Also the presence and detection of contamination
[28:01.790 --> 28:04.390]  is important just from a compliance standpoint,
[28:04.390 --> 28:05.830]  safety standpoint.
[28:05.830 --> 28:08.910]  You don't want to sell product that you unwillingly know
[28:08.910 --> 28:11.430]  is laden with microbials.
[28:11.430 --> 28:14.270]  So you definitely need to have a testing strategy
[28:14.270 --> 28:17.870]  in place to be able to confirm and mitigate any presence
[28:17.870 --> 28:19.830]  in detection of contamination.
[28:19.830 --> 28:21.270]  Regulatory compliance.
[28:21.270 --> 28:24.950]  Usually every market will have some sort of standard
[28:24.950 --> 28:27.150]  for testing, whether that's holding you to a standard
[28:27.150 --> 28:28.550]  internally or externally.
[28:28.550 --> 28:31.430]  So you have to make sure you incorporate testing
[28:31.430 --> 28:34.350]  to have the regulatory compliance box checked.
[28:34.350 --> 28:37.830]  And also product and consumer safety, as we talked about,
[28:37.830 --> 28:40.230]  making sure that you're being completely transparent
[28:40.230 --> 28:42.550]  with what you're selling to your consumer
[28:42.550 --> 28:45.550]  and having that door open to where they can double check
[28:45.550 --> 28:48.670]  and look through data and metrics to say, okay,
[28:48.670 --> 28:50.430]  this does confirm what the packaging
[28:50.430 --> 28:51.790]  or the label has claimed.
[28:52.310 --> 28:55.790]  So just to give you an idea of what a consumer would see,
[28:55.790 --> 28:57.670]  here's a summarized COA.
[28:57.670 --> 28:59.510]  This is basically giving the potency,
[28:59.510 --> 29:02.470]  what the percentage of THC is in the product,
[29:02.470 --> 29:05.270]  who prepared it, what the terpene profile is,
[29:05.270 --> 29:07.790]  and the contaminant analysis shows whether or not
[29:07.790 --> 29:11.430]  it's passing or failing for heavy metals, pesticides,
[29:11.430 --> 29:13.710]  mycotoxins and microbials.
[29:13.710 --> 29:16.750]  These tests have become standard in the industry.
[29:16.750 --> 29:18.830]  You'll usually see these across a COA.
[29:18.830 --> 29:20.790]  You don't necessarily see them in the market.
[29:20.790 --> 29:23.990]  You don't necessarily have to have a full panel
[29:23.990 --> 29:24.990]  in your testing package,
[29:24.990 --> 29:27.990]  but this is usually typical of a final product
[29:27.990 --> 29:30.750]  before it's sold in a dispensary.
[29:30.750 --> 29:32.790]  You also have detailed COAs,
[29:32.790 --> 29:35.070]  and these are my personal favorite because, you know,
[29:35.070 --> 29:36.990]  I like to get a little nerdy with the numbers
[29:36.990 --> 29:40.670]  and just really enjoy seeing if there's any trends in data
[29:40.670 --> 29:43.270]  that I can kind of monitor to see if there's anything
[29:43.270 --> 29:46.750]  you need to put in place early on for any contaminant spikes.
[29:46.750 --> 29:48.910]  So a detailed COA is gonna give you things
[29:48.910 --> 29:52.430]  like an image of the product that's being tested.
[29:52.430 --> 29:54.310]  In this example, they're testing flour.
[29:54.310 --> 29:56.710]  So you have a picture of the flour there.
[29:56.710 --> 30:01.590]  You have safety check, which includes certain analyses.
[30:01.590 --> 30:04.350]  Then you have your cannabinoid content, graphs.
[30:04.350 --> 30:06.710]  You have specific concentrations
[30:06.710 --> 30:09.470]  and how those work up against the method LODs.
[30:09.470 --> 30:12.150]  So this is a very detailed COA.
[30:12.150 --> 30:14.470]  This is something that essentially a consumer,
[30:14.470 --> 30:16.630]  this might be overwhelming to them,
[30:16.630 --> 30:18.150]  but for a product manufacturer,
[30:18.150 --> 30:21.550]  this is very informative for process
[30:21.550 --> 30:26.210]  and for what's being performed.
[30:26.210 --> 30:28.810]  So the necessity of the compliance piece
[30:28.810 --> 30:33.050]  is extremely important, and it's connected.
[30:33.050 --> 30:35.530]  It's interconnected with the facility design
[30:35.530 --> 30:37.650]  and how you're gonna run the business.
[30:37.650 --> 30:39.450]  A lot of how your business model
[30:39.450 --> 30:41.170]  is gonna be drafted and planned
[30:41.170 --> 30:43.250]  is essentially given to you through the standards
[30:43.250 --> 30:45.210]  of the state market that you're working within
[30:45.210 --> 30:48.530]  or the regulatory agency of your country.
[30:48.530 --> 30:51.330]  So there's no guesswork there, which is nice.
[30:51.330 --> 30:53.930]  But you do have to put in your own pieces
[30:53.930 --> 30:56.930]  to make sure that you're granting consumer
[30:56.930 --> 30:59.330]  and employee safety at a high priority,
[30:59.330 --> 31:02.130]  that you're following all of your licensing requirements
[31:02.130 --> 31:06.090]  to keep your CO and make sure that you stay operational.
[31:06.090 --> 31:07.850]  You're in continuous production,
[31:07.850 --> 31:09.850]  and you don't have pitfalls
[31:09.850 --> 31:11.370]  and equipment breakdowns frequently
[31:11.370 --> 31:14.650]  because you've already planned for those risk factors.
[31:14.650 --> 31:17.650]  And you have a very safe and sanitized environment
[31:17.650 --> 31:19.850]  that you're controlling your product within.
[31:19.850 --> 31:21.770]  So compliance is extremely necessary
[31:21.770 --> 31:24.130]  to the success of starting up
[31:24.130 --> 31:28.410]  an operating manufacturing business.
[31:28.410 --> 31:30.050]  Also, compliance is important
[31:30.050 --> 31:32.050]  because you're building trust with others.
[31:32.050 --> 31:33.650]  You're also avoiding criminal charges
[31:33.650 --> 31:34.810]  because you're staying compliant
[31:34.810 --> 31:36.970]  within your licensing requirements.
[31:36.970 --> 31:39.410]  You're avoiding fees, penalties, being shut down,
[31:39.410 --> 31:40.970]  having products recalled.
[31:40.970 --> 31:44.130]  These things can be detrimental to a startup company.
[31:44.130 --> 31:45.650]  You're improving your public relations
[31:45.650 --> 31:47.330]  by being transparent with your product
[31:47.330 --> 31:49.930]  and providing consumers with the information
[31:49.930 --> 31:53.210]  that they need to make an informed decision between brands.
[31:53.210 --> 31:55.410]  You're also attracting and keeping the right talent
[31:55.410 --> 31:56.610]  to produce the product for you
[31:56.610 --> 31:59.210]  because you're also transparent to your staff
[31:59.210 --> 32:01.370]  and making sure they understand your priorities
[32:01.370 --> 32:03.090]  in quality and safety.
[32:03.090 --> 32:05.370]  You're also reducing any unforced errors.
[32:05.370 --> 32:07.130]  So you don't want to have the redundancy
[32:07.130 --> 32:09.850]  of having to go back and remediate and fix
[32:09.850 --> 32:14.370]  every five seconds you run into a challenge.
[32:14.370 --> 32:17.370]  So now that we've kind of discussed facility design,
[32:17.370 --> 32:20.170]  a bit of extraction chemistry and technology,
[32:20.170 --> 32:23.290]  how that all kind of flows into manufacturing a product
[32:23.290 --> 32:25.450]  to sell into the market,
[32:26.610 --> 32:28.610]  this leads into operating
[32:28.610 --> 32:30.730]  a successful canvas manufacturing business.
[32:30.730 --> 32:33.650]  All of these different pillars that we discussed.
[32:33.650 --> 32:35.370]  So let's look at the products
[32:35.370 --> 32:37.810]  that can unlock the doors of revenue
[32:37.810 --> 32:39.210]  for your newly formed company
[32:39.210 --> 32:42.490]  that you now understand exactly how
[32:42.490 --> 32:46.850]  to operate compliantly, legally, and hopefully profitably.
[32:49.750 --> 32:51.630]  So I know that we're talking about
[32:51.630 --> 32:53.070]  a canvas manufacturing plant,
[32:53.070 --> 32:55.070]  which usually is a middleman
[32:55.070 --> 32:58.030]  to cultivators and the dispensaries.
[32:58.030 --> 33:01.270]  However, I just really love paying homage to the flower.
[33:01.270 --> 33:02.910]  The flower is where it all begins.
[33:02.910 --> 33:05.390]  This is where a lot of the cannabinoids
[33:05.390 --> 33:07.750]  and therapeutic benefits belong.
[33:07.750 --> 33:10.950]  And this is why we've all jumped into the industry.
[33:10.950 --> 33:12.670]  So I love showing the product of flower
[33:12.670 --> 33:15.790]  because this is the input
[33:15.790 --> 33:18.270]  into all of the infused cannabis products
[33:18.270 --> 33:20.910]  that hopefully you'll be making out of your facility.
[33:22.470 --> 33:24.470]  Here's some of the most common
[33:24.470 --> 33:27.110]  infused cannabis products in the market.
[33:27.110 --> 33:29.630]  I would say a lot of these common infused canvas products,
[33:29.630 --> 33:33.630]  now that I've worked in several markets globally,
[33:33.630 --> 33:36.750]  this is definitely on the North American side.
[33:36.750 --> 33:39.030]  The North American market is very mature
[33:39.030 --> 33:40.830]  as to where cannabis products
[33:40.830 --> 33:43.110]  are now becoming a lot more commoditized.
[33:43.110 --> 33:45.790]  You're having a lot more companies that are going public.
[33:45.790 --> 33:47.910]  So it's just a different environment
[33:47.910 --> 33:49.550]  compared to like the UK, Europe,
[33:49.550 --> 33:53.150]  who are now starting up and just really starting to navigate
[33:53.150 --> 33:56.150]  how they wanna build the regulatory environments.
[33:56.150 --> 34:00.190]  So these infused products go really beyond this list,
[34:00.190 --> 34:02.510]  but some of the common ones that you'll see
[34:02.510 --> 34:03.870]  are like tincture oils.
[34:03.870 --> 34:05.270]  The tincture oils are very common
[34:05.270 --> 34:08.470]  in epileptic patients and children.
[34:08.470 --> 34:10.230]  Tincture oils are really good for people
[34:10.230 --> 34:12.270]  who really crave that discretion
[34:12.270 --> 34:14.630]  in consuming cannabis products.
[34:14.630 --> 34:15.630]  Vape cartridges,
[34:15.630 --> 34:18.590]  these are becoming extremely common and popular.
[34:18.590 --> 34:22.270]  Even though we had the issue of the vape crisis
[34:22.270 --> 34:25.270]  with some really illicit things being used
[34:25.270 --> 34:27.390]  as filling agents in vape carts,
[34:27.390 --> 34:30.230]  I think it was a wake-up call to several industries
[34:30.230 --> 34:33.190]  to just really understand the product quality piece
[34:33.190 --> 34:34.550]  and the consumer safety piece.
[34:34.550 --> 34:36.910]  So you're starting to see a lot of innovation
[34:36.910 --> 34:40.190]  in the formulas for the vape cartridges, which is exciting.
[34:41.150 --> 34:43.030]  In medical markets and some adults,
[34:43.030 --> 34:47.030]  you have capsules being produced alongside edibles.
[34:47.030 --> 34:48.630]  The edibles are really,
[34:48.630 --> 34:51.990]  you're starting to see a big jump in edibles across markets
[34:51.990 --> 34:53.670]  and their innovation and the changes.
[34:53.670 --> 34:55.950]  You used to have just gummies and chocolates,
[34:55.950 --> 34:59.030]  but now you're starting to see gummies, chocolates,
[34:59.030 --> 35:00.990]  granolas, fruit bars.
[35:00.990 --> 35:02.510]  There's just all sorts of things.
[35:02.510 --> 35:04.750]  So that's pretty cool.
[35:04.750 --> 35:06.470]  And then concentrates.
[35:06.470 --> 35:08.430]  Concentrates are for, in my opinion,
[35:08.470 --> 35:10.430]  a sophisticated cannabis connoisseur
[35:10.430 --> 35:12.150]  that needs something that's gonna be
[35:12.150 --> 35:13.470]  a little bit more potent.
[35:13.470 --> 35:14.990]  Typically, your concentrate products
[35:14.990 --> 35:18.510]  are gonna be higher than 70% of your active ingredient,
[35:18.510 --> 35:21.910]  whether that's CBD concentrate or THC concentrate.
[35:21.910 --> 35:23.230]  So these are interesting,
[35:23.230 --> 35:25.390]  but these are actually starting to gain a lot of traction
[35:25.390 --> 35:26.990]  in the market with popularity as well
[35:26.990 --> 35:29.830]  because of the artisanal production
[35:29.830 --> 35:31.230]  of a lot of the concentrates
[35:31.230 --> 35:32.670]  and being able to do that
[35:32.670 --> 35:34.030]  with a lot of solventless methods.
[35:34.030 --> 35:36.590]  So it makes them extremely safe as well.
[35:36.630 --> 35:38.910]  And a lot of consumers have said concentrates
[35:38.910 --> 35:43.630]  are the closest picture to the cannabinoid profile
[35:43.630 --> 35:46.270]  of the original flower biomass.
[35:46.270 --> 35:49.870]  So that's extremely important to just kind of note.
[35:52.030 --> 35:53.390]  And just kind of digging in
[35:53.390 --> 35:55.230]  with the concentrate product variety,
[35:55.230 --> 35:58.310]  there's obviously rosin, resin, shatters,
[35:58.310 --> 36:00.470]  waxes, butters, crumbles.
[36:00.470 --> 36:03.510]  These things are evolving in the industry as well.
[36:04.510 --> 36:06.070]  And I really love talking about
[36:06.070 --> 36:08.510]  some of the novel products too.
[36:08.510 --> 36:10.310]  The innovation of this industry
[36:10.310 --> 36:12.390]  and having a lot of people involved
[36:12.390 --> 36:14.830]  from multidisciplinary backgrounds
[36:14.830 --> 36:16.670]  is really starting to show
[36:16.670 --> 36:19.070]  in the research and development of product formulations
[36:19.070 --> 36:20.950]  and the applications of products.
[36:20.950 --> 36:22.910]  So now you're starting to see novel products
[36:22.910 --> 36:24.790]  pop up in the wellness industry
[36:24.790 --> 36:26.510]  through the form of topicals.
[36:26.510 --> 36:29.790]  You have infused shampoos and conditioners.
[36:29.790 --> 36:32.430]  You have all sorts of things now in the wellness industry.
[36:32.470 --> 36:34.230]  You have sexual health products
[36:34.230 --> 36:37.310]  that are now starting to be developed in an infused manner.
[36:37.310 --> 36:41.310]  You have beverages, transdermal patches, sublingual sprays.
[36:41.310 --> 36:45.630]  I read a study the other day about eye drops being developed
[36:45.630 --> 36:48.950]  to help with glaucoma patients, and then cosmetics.
[36:48.950 --> 36:52.070]  So there are so many different things
[36:52.070 --> 36:53.710]  that are being developed in this industry.
[36:53.710 --> 36:55.710]  And the fun thing about product development,
[36:55.710 --> 36:58.790]  if you're really focused on developing
[36:58.790 --> 37:00.990]  a cannabis manufacturing or extraction facility,
[37:01.910 --> 37:05.110]  then you have the ultimate opportunity
[37:05.110 --> 37:07.030]  to be able to really penetrate the market
[37:07.030 --> 37:09.150]  with something that's a little bit more niche
[37:09.150 --> 37:13.390]  or something that's a differentiated oldie but goodie.
[37:13.390 --> 37:15.590]  But that's the cool thing about understanding
[37:15.590 --> 37:17.870]  the extraction chemistry and product development
[37:17.870 --> 37:21.110]  alongside operating a compliant facility.
[37:22.950 --> 37:25.830]  So thank you very, very much everyone
[37:25.830 --> 37:27.790]  for joining me this afternoon
[37:27.790 --> 37:31.190]  for a quick blurb about extraction chemistry,
[37:31.190 --> 37:33.070]  facility design, product development,
[37:33.070 --> 37:34.630]  and what can come out of that facility.
[37:34.630 --> 37:36.030]  And I just really hope you were able
[37:36.030 --> 37:38.870]  to take away a few things.
[37:38.870 --> 37:40.830]  As you can see, my contact information
[37:40.830 --> 37:43.630]  is listed here on this last slide.
[37:43.630 --> 37:45.910]  You can reach me by email, website.
[37:45.910 --> 37:48.550]  We're on Instagram, LinkedIn as well.
[37:48.550 --> 37:51.270]  But thank you very much for your attention.
[37:51.270 --> 37:54.230]  And I'm gonna turn it over to open it up for questions.
[37:55.230 --> 37:57.230]  Awesome. Thank you so much.
[37:58.430 --> 38:00.350]  Zach, did you want to say anything?
[38:00.350 --> 38:02.470]  No, just that was mind blowing.
[38:02.470 --> 38:03.830]  Thank you, Alicia.
[38:03.830 --> 38:05.630]  Oh, thank you so much.
[38:06.870 --> 38:08.790]  I'll just remind all of our participants,
[38:08.790 --> 38:10.230]  if you have any questions,
[38:10.230 --> 38:12.590]  please put them in the Q&A box.
[38:12.590 --> 38:14.390]  You can find that at the center
[38:14.390 --> 38:15.590]  of the bottom of your screen.
[38:15.590 --> 38:18.030]  And then I'll work through as many as I can
[38:18.030 --> 38:20.430]  in the next 15 or 20 minutes here.
[38:20.430 --> 38:21.270]  All right.
[38:21.270 --> 38:23.070]  So our first question,
[38:24.830 --> 38:27.470]  could you elaborate on what HPLC is
[38:27.470 --> 38:29.670]  and maybe how it's used in the industry?
[38:29.670 --> 38:30.710]  Sure.
[38:30.710 --> 38:35.190]  So HPLC is considered high pressure liquid chromatography.
[38:35.190 --> 38:36.710]  You also have UHPLCs,
[38:36.710 --> 38:39.630]  which are ultra high pressure liquid chromatography.
[38:39.630 --> 38:42.390]  That's just a mechanism for separation.
[38:42.390 --> 38:45.430]  So HPLC is an instrument that's used
[38:45.430 --> 38:46.950]  in the analytical laboratories
[38:46.950 --> 38:49.590]  to essentially separate the liquid
[38:49.590 --> 38:53.110]  and essentially separate your cannabinoid content
[38:53.110 --> 38:54.790]  from the product matrix
[38:54.790 --> 38:59.550]  and give you an accurate quantitation based on standards.
[38:59.550 --> 39:01.030]  So it's a piece of equipment
[39:01.030 --> 39:03.910]  that is extremely common across the industry
[39:03.910 --> 39:08.230]  in order to test for potency and product composition.
[39:09.430 --> 39:10.270]  Awesome.
[39:11.350 --> 39:14.470]  Our next question is about what people can do
[39:14.470 --> 39:17.310]  with spent hemp biomass,
[39:17.310 --> 39:19.110]  presumably after it's extracted.
[39:19.910 --> 39:20.750]  Sure.
[39:20.750 --> 39:21.910]  That's a really good question.
[39:21.910 --> 39:25.710]  And honestly, that depends on where you are.
[39:25.710 --> 39:27.590]  Some markets will allow you
[39:27.590 --> 39:30.350]  to essentially have your own waste management plan
[39:30.350 --> 39:31.230]  and you submit that.
[39:31.230 --> 39:33.870]  And as long as you're adhering to that, it's fine.
[39:33.870 --> 39:35.750]  But there's also other markets that will dictate
[39:35.750 --> 39:39.550]  you have to incinerate or you have to compost it
[39:39.550 --> 39:42.150]  or just anything like that.
[39:42.150 --> 39:44.510]  So it just really depends.
[39:44.510 --> 39:47.150]  But I would say some of the common ways
[39:47.150 --> 39:50.750]  of just disposal of spent material has been, like I said,
[39:51.710 --> 39:53.870]  having a contract with a disposal company
[39:53.870 --> 39:55.750]  that gets rid of it for you,
[39:55.750 --> 39:58.710]  having some sort of incineration technique
[39:58.710 --> 40:03.710]  or being able to reuse that in your crop cultivation.
[40:04.710 --> 40:05.550]  Awesome.
[40:06.710 --> 40:09.270]  We have another question about,
[40:11.190 --> 40:14.110]  are there different kind of testing requirements
[40:14.150 --> 40:19.150]  for hemp versus THC cannabis in different states?
[40:19.870 --> 40:24.270]  And I guess, do you think that hemp should be regulated
[40:24.270 --> 40:27.390]  or tested as heavily as high THC cannabis?
[40:28.310 --> 40:29.230]  Oh, that's a good question.
[40:29.230 --> 40:32.190]  So from a scientific standpoint,
[40:32.190 --> 40:36.190]  there is no difference between the analytical methodology
[40:36.190 --> 40:39.310]  that's used for the potency,
[40:39.310 --> 40:41.150]  for the cannabinoid profile of hemp
[40:41.150 --> 40:43.830]  and the cannabinoid profile of cannabis.
[40:44.510 --> 40:46.350]  It's the same exact method that you run
[40:46.350 --> 40:48.950]  to be able to tell you what that potency is.
[40:48.950 --> 40:50.630]  So there is no difference there.
[40:50.630 --> 40:52.430]  I would say the only difference
[40:52.430 --> 40:53.950]  of what you're looking for though,
[40:53.950 --> 40:56.750]  has to do with the legislation and the regulations.
[40:56.750 --> 40:58.430]  So with the hemp industry,
[40:58.430 --> 40:59.590]  if you're working in a hemp market,
[40:59.590 --> 41:02.230]  then you're subjected to biomass
[41:02.230 --> 41:04.870]  that's no higher than 0.3%.
[41:04.870 --> 41:06.390]  That's in the States though, by the way,
[41:06.390 --> 41:08.190]  because I have worked in multiple markets.
[41:08.190 --> 41:10.750]  So like in the UK, it's 0.2%.
[41:10.750 --> 41:13.590]  It's just different across places in Europe.
[41:14.350 --> 41:15.910]  So just knowing what your threshold is,
[41:15.910 --> 41:17.550]  if you're in a hemp industry,
[41:17.550 --> 41:22.110]  and then you can put into place how to harvest properly
[41:22.110 --> 41:24.750]  or cultivate towards those limits,
[41:24.750 --> 41:26.110]  but there really is no difference.
[41:26.110 --> 41:29.550]  And then as far as the testing regime,
[41:29.550 --> 41:33.350]  one, I'm gonna always be on the side of rigorous testing
[41:33.350 --> 41:36.190]  because it's gonna keep the consumer safe.
[41:36.190 --> 41:37.510]  For me as a producer,
[41:37.510 --> 41:40.630]  if there's an audit every week of someone coming in
[41:40.670 --> 41:42.630]  and just essentially checking the temperature
[41:42.630 --> 41:46.430]  of my facility, as a consumer of my product, I want that.
[41:46.430 --> 41:48.310]  I wanna know that you're going through
[41:48.310 --> 41:49.830]  all these random inspections
[41:49.830 --> 41:52.070]  to make sure you're keeping me safe.
[41:52.070 --> 41:54.910]  So I definitely think that we have to have rigorous testing
[41:54.910 --> 41:59.870]  in the industry, but I don't think that we're to the point
[41:59.870 --> 42:02.910]  just educationally that we understand
[42:02.910 --> 42:04.830]  what it is we're testing for
[42:04.830 --> 42:07.470]  and what's considered legal and illegal.
[42:07.470 --> 42:10.430]  I think the lines are very blurred there at this moment
[42:11.230 --> 42:12.550]  in our political landscape.
[42:12.550 --> 42:17.270]  And I think until we define what's being considered illegal
[42:17.270 --> 42:19.590]  and legal, whether it's cannabis as the plant
[42:19.590 --> 42:22.590]  or whether that's actual THC, CBD,
[42:22.590 --> 42:24.990]  then it's gonna be very hard to be able to tell
[42:24.990 --> 42:27.590]  in the future how the testing strategy
[42:27.590 --> 42:30.270]  of whatever market or government you're operating in
[42:30.270 --> 42:31.990]  is gonna look like.
[42:31.990 --> 42:33.630]  Awesome.
[42:33.630 --> 42:37.470]  Can you make a comparison of different extraction methods
[42:37.470 --> 42:40.830]  with regards to which is the healthiest to consume?
[42:41.950 --> 42:42.790]  Oh, sure.
[42:42.790 --> 42:46.590]  So there's a lot of studies out there show,
[42:46.590 --> 42:50.150]  one, the purgeability of solvents from cannabis products
[42:50.150 --> 42:51.910]  and related matrices.
[42:51.910 --> 42:54.790]  It also shows just how that removability
[42:54.790 --> 42:55.630]  affects the product.
[42:55.630 --> 42:58.470]  So if you, I'm sorry,
[42:58.470 --> 42:59.790]  can you just repeat that one more time?
[42:59.790 --> 43:01.030]  I start to answer these things
[43:01.030 --> 43:02.510]  and I have a train of thought.
[43:03.990 --> 43:05.270]  Yeah, different methods
[43:05.550 --> 43:08.510]  and which ones might be healthier or less healthy.
[43:08.510 --> 43:09.630]  Right, right, right.
[43:09.630 --> 43:13.110]  So that all depends again on the purgeability of solvent.
[43:13.110 --> 43:15.790]  So a lot of consumers have said,
[43:15.790 --> 43:18.110]  and I'm gonna say this from a consumer standpoint
[43:18.110 --> 43:19.910]  of research, but a lot of consumers
[43:19.910 --> 43:22.110]  really enjoy CO2 extracts
[43:22.110 --> 43:25.670]  because of the natural effervescence of CO2 from a product,
[43:25.670 --> 43:27.630]  it will naturally purge itself
[43:27.630 --> 43:31.070]  and it's also not considered toxic.
[43:31.070 --> 43:33.990]  And then, when it comes to other products
[43:33.990 --> 43:35.070]  as far as consumption,
[43:35.070 --> 43:37.150]  as long as they're within the specifications
[43:37.150 --> 43:40.110]  that are laid out within your regulatory market
[43:40.110 --> 43:42.030]  as being considered safe,
[43:42.030 --> 43:44.430]  there are quite a few solvents that are,
[43:44.430 --> 43:46.870]  they're called GRAS solvents,
[43:46.870 --> 43:51.710]  G-R-A-S, which are generally recognized as safe solvents.
[43:51.710 --> 43:55.230]  So as long as you have them below exposure limits,
[43:55.230 --> 43:58.350]  below those permissible limits to toxic exposure,
[43:58.350 --> 44:00.550]  then you should be okay with any product
[44:00.550 --> 44:02.190]  of how it's being extracted
[44:02.190 --> 44:04.190]  as long as that's being purged properly.
[44:05.230 --> 44:06.070]  Great.
[44:06.990 --> 44:08.350]  Another question,
[44:08.350 --> 44:10.950]  to what extent are you finding individual growers
[44:10.950 --> 44:13.150]  or farms building onsite extraction
[44:13.150 --> 44:14.830]  or processing facilities?
[44:16.390 --> 44:18.390]  Well, it depends.
[44:18.390 --> 44:21.190]  It depends on budget and then it depends on experience.
[44:21.190 --> 44:23.430]  There are some people who have the budget
[44:23.430 --> 44:25.710]  and they've experienced having challenges
[44:25.710 --> 44:28.550]  with biomass being contaminated when they receive it,
[44:28.550 --> 44:30.790]  having to remediate those things within their facility
[44:30.790 --> 44:32.110]  before they can sell a product.
[44:32.110 --> 44:34.430]  And then obviously that taps into profits.
[44:34.430 --> 44:37.670]  So those scenarios,
[44:37.670 --> 44:39.470]  I would say that at a rapid pace,
[44:39.470 --> 44:42.390]  those people are considering cultivation licenses
[44:42.390 --> 44:44.830]  so they can start vertically integrating
[44:44.830 --> 44:47.790]  to control their supply chain as much as possible.
[44:47.790 --> 44:48.910]  But then on the flip side,
[44:48.910 --> 44:50.910]  you would say there's people
[44:50.910 --> 44:52.670]  that just aren't attracted to that model
[44:52.670 --> 44:55.550]  because of the ongoing implications
[44:55.550 --> 44:57.390]  of having now a secondary business
[44:57.390 --> 44:59.590]  that's attached to your primary business.
[44:59.590 --> 45:00.790]  It has its own risk,
[45:00.790 --> 45:04.430]  its own operation and overhead costs and things like that.
[45:04.430 --> 45:07.310]  So it really just depends on your scenario
[45:07.310 --> 45:08.830]  and what you're doing,
[45:08.830 --> 45:10.590]  but there's definitely just a,
[45:10.590 --> 45:12.470]  it's not a one size fits all industry,
[45:12.470 --> 45:13.430]  which is kind of nice.
[45:13.430 --> 45:16.830]  So you do see quite a few scenarios playing out
[45:16.830 --> 45:18.270]  in multiple markets.
[45:19.150 --> 45:20.150]  Awesome.
[45:20.150 --> 45:21.870]  Another question,
[45:21.870 --> 45:24.630]  what are the best home testing products
[45:24.630 --> 45:25.950]  on the market at present?
[45:27.030 --> 45:28.270]  Oh, that's a great question.
[45:28.270 --> 45:30.190]  Honestly, I wish I could answer it thoroughly.
[45:30.190 --> 45:33.990]  However, I have not delved into the home testing products.
[45:33.990 --> 45:38.710]  In my opinion, I'm just such a skeptic of the quick scan
[45:39.870 --> 45:43.910]  and you'll give me 50% THC in my product type products,
[45:43.910 --> 45:47.110]  but I just don't have enough knowledge around the subject
[45:47.110 --> 45:48.790]  to just give an informed answer.
[45:48.790 --> 45:52.310]  But I definitely think if it's using robust technology,
[45:52.310 --> 45:55.550]  if you can do your due diligence on the equipment
[45:55.630 --> 45:58.710]  to just confirm that it does what it does
[45:58.710 --> 45:59.990]  and there's some accuracy there,
[45:59.990 --> 46:01.910]  then I would say that's a development
[46:01.910 --> 46:04.990]  that has a lot of traction for the future.
[46:06.150 --> 46:07.510]  Awesome.
[46:07.510 --> 46:09.510]  There's a couple of questions about the difference
[46:09.510 --> 46:13.510]  between Delta-8 and Delta-9 THC.
[46:13.510 --> 46:15.430]  If you could touch on that.
[46:15.430 --> 46:16.270]  Sure.
[46:16.270 --> 46:18.270]  So the difference between Delta-8 and Delta-9
[46:18.270 --> 46:21.590]  is a little bit of the psychoactivity
[46:21.590 --> 46:23.950]  and how it binds to the receptors
[46:23.950 --> 46:25.670]  in the endocannabinoid system
[46:25.670 --> 46:28.710]  and how long that binding lasts.
[46:28.710 --> 46:30.390]  So what the effects are.
[46:30.390 --> 46:32.350]  So I would say those are the biggest differences
[46:32.350 --> 46:33.950]  between Delta-8 and Delta-9.
[46:33.950 --> 46:36.710]  Again, it depends on your individual cannabinoid system
[46:36.710 --> 46:40.870]  to say which one is more psychoactive versus the other.
[46:40.870 --> 46:42.110]  Some people have reported
[46:42.110 --> 46:43.390]  that they don't feel a difference.
[46:43.390 --> 46:45.230]  It feels like CBD to them.
[46:45.230 --> 46:47.790]  Some people have said that it's more psychoactive
[46:47.790 --> 46:50.670]  than Delta-9, but that's all obviously dependent
[46:50.670 --> 46:53.070]  upon your own unique cannabinoid system.
[46:53.070 --> 46:56.030]  But for the most part, just structurally,
[46:56.030 --> 46:58.390]  the differences are the psychoactivity levels,
[46:58.390 --> 47:03.390]  how it binds and how long those bindings interact.
[47:03.710 --> 47:04.830]  Great.
[47:04.830 --> 47:05.910]  Another question.
[47:07.790 --> 47:12.790]  What innovations do you see coming for cannabis extracts?
[47:13.310 --> 47:15.710]  Also, what would you personally like to see in the market
[47:15.710 --> 47:17.270]  that you haven't seen just yet?
[47:18.190 --> 47:19.710]  Oh, so some of the innovations
[47:19.710 --> 47:20.990]  that I see coming in the market
[47:20.990 --> 47:23.870]  have been around automation, honestly.
[47:23.870 --> 47:26.110]  A lot of the demand of the market
[47:26.110 --> 47:28.710]  and a lot of these markets opening up globally,
[47:28.710 --> 47:32.070]  it's really starting to show that startup companies
[47:32.070 --> 47:33.310]  in the beginning may have thought
[47:33.310 --> 47:35.230]  that their market size was a certain way,
[47:35.230 --> 47:37.590]  but now they're starting to see that that demand is high.
[47:37.590 --> 47:42.030]  So I think there's such an opportunity for innovation
[47:42.030 --> 47:44.990]  just on the scale-up piece of being able to produce
[47:44.990 --> 47:49.470]  at higher volumes and still keep that craft quality
[47:49.470 --> 47:52.790]  that a lot of sophisticated cannabis connoisseurs love.
[47:52.790 --> 47:54.910]  And I definitely think there's some innovation
[47:54.910 --> 47:57.470]  around product formulations as well.
[47:57.470 --> 47:59.870]  Something that I would really love to see
[47:59.870 --> 48:01.790]  would be a lot more products
[48:01.790 --> 48:04.070]  formulated around women's health.
[48:04.070 --> 48:06.150]  There's definitely a lot more conversations
[48:06.150 --> 48:09.390]  that are being had around women's health and pain,
[48:09.390 --> 48:12.230]  pain with menstruation, different things with sexual health.
[48:12.230 --> 48:15.190]  So it'd be nice to see research going in that direction
[48:15.190 --> 48:19.870]  and really starting to revolutionize that type of medicine.
[48:20.910 --> 48:21.750]  Another question.
[48:23.070 --> 48:24.710]  With regard to sustainability
[48:24.710 --> 48:26.470]  and specifically energy consumption,
[48:26.470 --> 48:28.550]  have you encountered any extraction facilities
[48:28.550 --> 48:31.070]  that are already running off of 100% clean
[48:31.070 --> 48:32.670]  or renewable energy?
[48:32.670 --> 48:35.710]  How realistic is it to achieve this level of sustainability
[48:35.710 --> 48:39.390]  considering the typical energy demands of these facilities?
[48:39.390 --> 48:43.110]  Sure, so no, I have not encountered a facility just yet
[48:43.110 --> 48:47.550]  that is just 100% sustainable and renewable energy.
[48:47.550 --> 48:49.990]  However, I definitely think that that's something
[48:49.990 --> 48:53.390]  that is achievable, but I think it's gonna take some time
[48:53.390 --> 48:55.550]  and it's gonna take multiple partners
[48:55.550 --> 48:57.270]  collaborating around the world.
[48:57.270 --> 48:59.430]  It's gonna take the partners that obviously have the funding
[48:59.430 --> 49:02.710]  to be able to put those infrastructures in place
[49:02.710 --> 49:05.910]  for their facility, but it's also gonna take the development
[49:05.910 --> 49:08.230]  and the data and actually testing those methods
[49:08.230 --> 49:11.190]  to see if it's working and how it's affecting yields of crops
[49:11.190 --> 49:12.030]  and things like that.
[49:12.030 --> 49:16.030]  So I don't think we're quite there yet in the conversation
[49:16.030 --> 49:17.830]  to be able to produce real world data,
[49:17.830 --> 49:20.710]  but I definitely think there are firms across the world
[49:20.710 --> 49:22.470]  that are working towards that goal.
[49:23.510 --> 49:24.630]  Awesome.
[49:24.630 --> 49:27.910]  Another question kind of on that line,
[49:27.910 --> 49:29.270]  when it comes to product design,
[49:29.270 --> 49:32.870]  do you feel like more products should or could be designed
[49:32.870 --> 49:34.390]  to minimize their waste?
[49:36.270 --> 49:38.510]  That's a really, really great question.
[49:38.510 --> 49:40.110]  And yes, I do.
[49:40.110 --> 49:42.310]  So kind of coming back to babe carts,
[49:42.310 --> 49:44.630]  just to bring that example,
[49:44.630 --> 49:46.590]  when you're using a filler or cutting agent,
[49:46.590 --> 49:49.990]  you're introducing another ingredient into the formula.
[49:49.990 --> 49:54.030]  So by cutting out any type of cutting agents
[49:54.030 --> 49:55.270]  that are coming into the formula
[49:55.270 --> 49:58.270]  and just using cannabis oil, terpenes,
[49:58.270 --> 50:01.870]  and just different mixes of those,
[50:01.870 --> 50:04.070]  I think right there, you cut out waste
[50:04.070 --> 50:07.110]  and you're able to operate your line a little bit more lean.
[50:07.110 --> 50:08.510]  You've just cut out an ingredient,
[50:08.510 --> 50:12.590]  you've cut out any type of issues with packaging
[50:12.590 --> 50:14.990]  as far as that ingredient goes and having to store it.
[50:14.990 --> 50:16.150]  So there's just a lot of ways
[50:16.150 --> 50:19.630]  that you can kind of think about innovating on a lean way
[50:19.630 --> 50:22.350]  and optimizing those processes from that standpoint.
[50:23.950 --> 50:28.950]  We have a question about CO2 dissipating from products
[50:30.310 --> 50:33.710]  after extraction and whether people have looked at
[50:33.710 --> 50:38.710]  whether it dissipates or it degrades
[50:39.030 --> 50:41.310]  into oxygen and carbon monoxide.
[50:42.390 --> 50:43.870]  That's quite interesting.
[50:43.870 --> 50:47.270]  I have not heard about that study or research,
[50:47.270 --> 50:50.310]  but definitely would be looking into that.
[50:50.310 --> 50:53.070]  From what I understand, I haven't seen,
[50:53.070 --> 50:54.430]  I've been in the industry for six years
[50:54.430 --> 50:57.150]  and I haven't really seen anything come about
[50:57.150 --> 51:00.590]  as far as CO2 extracts having any undesirables
[51:00.590 --> 51:02.390]  and on the backend.
[51:02.390 --> 51:04.470]  But yeah, I'd be interested in any type of study
[51:04.470 --> 51:07.270]  that's showing any sort of risk factors.
[51:08.830 --> 51:11.670]  Can solvents degrade over time
[51:11.670 --> 51:13.590]  and or reduce the amount of cannabinoids
[51:13.590 --> 51:14.990]  extracted from the plant?
[51:16.110 --> 51:17.390]  Yes, absolutely.
[51:17.390 --> 51:20.070]  So one of the things I can say about that
[51:20.070 --> 51:22.950]  as far as an example, when you're using ethanol,
[51:22.950 --> 51:25.990]  for instance, so ethanol obviously has a proofing
[51:25.990 --> 51:28.470]  and you can have 200 proof ethanol
[51:28.470 --> 51:33.070]  and that 200 proof ethanol can lose its proofing over time,
[51:33.070 --> 51:36.510]  especially if it's open a container to the environment.
[51:36.510 --> 51:37.710]  If it's collecting any moisture,
[51:37.710 --> 51:39.190]  then it's gonna start to degrade.
[51:39.190 --> 51:41.870]  So you definitely have to keep an eye on that,
[51:41.870 --> 51:43.310]  test your solvents regularly
[51:43.310 --> 51:45.510]  to just keep that into compliance.
[51:45.510 --> 51:47.790]  And also too, if you're recycling solvents,
[51:47.790 --> 51:51.190]  so if you're recycling CO2 in a closed loop system
[51:51.190 --> 51:53.630]  or even ethanol extraction,
[51:53.630 --> 51:56.030]  you have to look at how many times
[51:56.030 --> 52:00.190]  you're saturating that solvent upon recycling of use.
[52:00.190 --> 52:02.910]  So that will also start to degrade the solvent
[52:02.910 --> 52:06.470]  and reduce the tunability of what it can select
[52:06.470 --> 52:07.870]  and actually extract out.
[52:08.870 --> 52:12.590]  Can you talk about what distinguishes a botanical extract
[52:12.590 --> 52:14.590]  from a botanical infusion?
[52:16.750 --> 52:18.430]  There are different licenses?
[52:18.430 --> 52:21.070]  Yes, so that's a great question.
[52:21.070 --> 52:24.110]  So a botanical extract, remember we're using a solvent
[52:24.110 --> 52:27.950]  to essentially pull the analytes out of the plant matrix.
[52:27.950 --> 52:32.590]  So a botanical extract is essentially taking the buds
[52:32.590 --> 52:34.390]  and passing it through the CO2.
[52:34.390 --> 52:36.670]  And then now you have your cannabinoids in there.
[52:36.670 --> 52:41.670]  An infusion is taking the cannabis oils or the cannabinoids
[52:42.670 --> 52:45.550]  and actually infusing those into a matrix.
[52:45.550 --> 52:48.590]  So I would say they're kind of opposite mechanisms.
[52:48.590 --> 52:51.390]  You have infusion, which is bringing it into a matrix.
[52:51.390 --> 52:53.710]  And then you have your botanical extraction,
[52:54.310 --> 52:56.150]  which is taking them out of a matrix.
[52:57.390 --> 53:02.390]  Awesome, another question on spent hemp biomass.
[53:02.830 --> 53:04.790]  What is being discussed in terms of use
[53:04.790 --> 53:07.110]  for food and or animal food?
[53:08.070 --> 53:09.030]  Also, that's interesting.
[53:09.030 --> 53:12.070]  There's a little bit of research being done in the States.
[53:12.070 --> 53:14.910]  There's also research being done over in Europe
[53:14.910 --> 53:18.550]  regarding animal feed and being able to pelletize hemp,
[53:18.550 --> 53:20.110]  spent hemp biomass.
[53:20.110 --> 53:21.870]  For a lot of the researchers,
[53:21.910 --> 53:23.950]  what they're looking at is gonna be,
[53:23.950 --> 53:25.510]  one, the solvent that was used
[53:25.510 --> 53:26.430]  because they have to check
[53:26.430 --> 53:28.790]  that it's under a certain permissible level, obviously,
[53:28.790 --> 53:30.870]  for ingestion of the animals.
[53:30.870 --> 53:32.630]  So that's gonna take some time.
[53:32.630 --> 53:35.590]  And then, obviously, the stability
[53:35.590 --> 53:37.310]  and making sure that those proteins
[53:37.310 --> 53:39.430]  stay active for the animals.
[53:39.430 --> 53:42.670]  So I know there are studies around the animal feed piece.
[53:42.670 --> 53:45.430]  There's definitely studies being done also
[53:45.430 --> 53:46.870]  around animal bedding
[53:46.870 --> 53:51.590]  because hemp has shown to be a great odor mitigator.
[53:52.270 --> 53:55.630]  It's highly absorbent without the odors, similar to hay,
[53:55.630 --> 53:57.510]  but just a little bit more effective.
[53:57.510 --> 53:59.630]  So there's studies around that as well.
[53:59.630 --> 54:01.470]  I think probably in the next couple of years,
[54:01.470 --> 54:04.830]  we'll start to see some provisional licenses
[54:04.830 --> 54:06.630]  or research companies coming out
[54:06.630 --> 54:09.230]  with different innovative ways of applying it.
[54:10.310 --> 54:12.390]  What considerations would you suggest
[54:12.390 --> 54:15.630]  with regards to GMP standards for facility design?
[54:16.670 --> 54:18.750]  So again, I'm a lab rat,
[54:18.750 --> 54:21.390]  so I'm always gonna say high quality,
[54:21.390 --> 54:22.790]  high consideration of safety.
[54:22.790 --> 54:25.150]  So when it comes to GMP standards,
[54:25.150 --> 54:28.710]  I definitely think that if you can afford
[54:28.710 --> 54:31.710]  to outfit your facility to meet the highest standards,
[54:31.710 --> 54:35.470]  whether that's, if you're in the States, 210, 211,
[54:35.470 --> 54:37.830]  if you're in Europe, it's EU GMP.
[54:37.830 --> 54:40.950]  But if you can meet the highest level of standard,
[54:40.950 --> 54:42.630]  I think you should go for that every time.
[54:42.630 --> 54:45.670]  Because again, just kind of taking off the hat
[54:45.670 --> 54:47.230]  of entrepreneur capitalists,
[54:47.230 --> 54:49.550]  you have to think this is a product
[54:49.550 --> 54:51.230]  that I'm putting into the market
[54:51.230 --> 54:53.670]  for potentially children to consume
[54:53.670 --> 54:57.230]  or immunocompromised elderly people to consume.
[54:57.230 --> 54:59.790]  So you do have to have a bit of a conscience there.
[55:00.750 --> 55:04.430]  Could you talk about baseline cost approximations
[55:04.430 --> 55:07.030]  comparing different extraction methods?
[55:07.030 --> 55:09.430]  Kind of generally, what would be more or less expensive
[55:09.430 --> 55:11.190]  in regards to equipment?
[55:11.190 --> 55:12.230]  Sure.
[55:12.230 --> 55:14.710]  So I've done a presentation before
[55:14.710 --> 55:17.390]  speaking about extraction equipment
[55:17.390 --> 55:18.670]  and what the pricing has been.
[55:18.670 --> 55:21.190]  And I can say just historically,
[55:21.190 --> 55:23.470]  when you're looking at high CapEx costs,
[55:23.470 --> 55:25.510]  usually your supercritical fluid CO2
[55:25.510 --> 55:27.870]  is gonna be at the top of the list.
[55:27.870 --> 55:31.110]  One of the reasons is behind the pumps that are needed,
[55:31.110 --> 55:34.230]  the condensers that are needed to recycle the solvent.
[55:34.230 --> 55:37.390]  You have just the pure scale of a lot of the CO2 instruments
[55:37.390 --> 55:40.350]  and the pressure ratings that you're using
[55:40.350 --> 55:41.190]  when you're in service.
[55:41.190 --> 55:42.830]  So the safety implications,
[55:42.830 --> 55:45.430]  there's a lot there that you have to consider.
[55:45.430 --> 55:47.590]  So that's usually the highest cost.
[55:47.590 --> 55:50.470]  On the lower end is usually the ethanol equipment.
[55:50.470 --> 55:53.710]  The ethanol equipment is usually the lower end of the scale.
[55:53.710 --> 55:55.430]  And we're talking,
[55:55.430 --> 56:00.150]  I've seen pieces of equipment as cheap as 75,000
[56:00.150 --> 56:03.510]  up to maybe like 135 for an extractor.
[56:03.510 --> 56:05.350]  And then those are easily scalable.
[56:05.350 --> 56:07.190]  And then with CO2 equipment,
[56:07.190 --> 56:11.350]  you're talking anywhere from 125 to half a million dollars,
[56:11.390 --> 56:14.590]  depending on the capacity of your extraction vessel.
[56:14.590 --> 56:16.230]  And then hydrocarbon extractors,
[56:16.230 --> 56:20.070]  I would say fall towards the lower end of the CapEx budget.
[56:20.070 --> 56:25.070]  And I do think it's because of their not so high desirability
[56:25.310 --> 56:27.430]  when it comes to the safety piece,
[56:27.430 --> 56:31.110]  but also because it's highly scalable too,
[56:31.110 --> 56:32.630]  similar to the ethanol equipment.
[56:32.630 --> 56:34.830]  So, and then solventless equipment
[56:34.830 --> 56:37.190]  is obviously at the very lowest end of the run
[56:37.190 --> 56:40.950]  because you're talking about maybe a five gallon bucket
[56:41.590 --> 56:42.430]  and you're throwing a bunch of bud inside
[56:42.430 --> 56:43.950]  with a shovel and you're mixing it around.
[56:43.950 --> 56:44.790]  No, I'm just kidding.
[56:44.790 --> 56:45.750]  That was five years ago.
[56:45.750 --> 56:48.750]  But now we're talking about just these like wash vessels
[56:48.750 --> 56:52.110]  with paddle mixers, a rosin press.
[56:52.110 --> 56:54.950]  So it's not anything that's sophisticated technologically.
[56:54.950 --> 56:56.550]  So it's gonna be a bit cheaper.
[56:57.830 --> 56:59.550]  So we're coming up on the end of the hour.
[56:59.550 --> 57:01.030]  Do we have time for one more
[57:01.030 --> 57:06.030]  or should we just give her a huge round of applause?
[57:06.310 --> 57:07.470]  I think that's the questions
[57:07.470 --> 57:08.910]  that put her through the ringer already.
[57:08.950 --> 57:09.790]  Yeah.
[57:09.790 --> 57:13.390]  Congratulations to our guests for coming up
[57:13.390 --> 57:18.110]  with a lot of awesome questions and ideas as well.
[57:18.110 --> 57:19.110]  Thank you.
[57:19.110 --> 57:20.030]  I really appreciate it.
[57:20.030 --> 57:21.230]  I had so much fun.
[57:21.230 --> 57:22.870]  This was extremely interactive
[57:22.870 --> 57:25.830]  and I just really hope someone in the audience
[57:25.830 --> 57:27.230]  was able to take something away.
[57:27.230 --> 57:30.270]  I think our purpose in this part of the industry
[57:30.270 --> 57:33.590]  with all of these opportunities is each one teach one.
[57:33.590 --> 57:35.110]  And if we can lift someone else up
[57:35.110 --> 57:36.630]  and just push them in a forward direction,
[57:36.630 --> 57:38.750]  then we're doing our jobs.
[57:39.590 --> 57:40.430]  Awesome.
[57:40.430 --> 57:43.310]  Hey, thank you all so much for coming here today
[57:43.310 --> 57:45.230]  and see you in two weeks.
[57:45.230 --> 57:46.070]  Thank you.
[57:46.070 --> 57:46.990]  Bye everyone.
