[00:00.000 --> 00:11.660]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:11.660 --> 00:13.780]  This is actually only my second time in New York.
[00:13.780 --> 00:15.500]  I'm from North Carolina.
[00:15.500 --> 00:17.740]  So as Larry mentioned, I'm the vice president
[00:17.740 --> 00:21.100]  of agronomian outreach for a company called Criticality.
[00:21.100 --> 00:23.220]  We're a vertically integrated processing company
[00:23.220 --> 00:24.520]  in the state of North Carolina.
[00:24.520 --> 00:28.860]  We have operations in four states currently.
[00:28.860 --> 00:32.500]  Our partner, who purchased 40% of us
[00:32.500 --> 00:34.820]  back a couple of years ago, is a company
[00:34.900 --> 00:36.300]  that you probably haven't heard of yet
[00:36.300 --> 00:38.260]  called Pixis International.
[00:38.260 --> 00:39.940]  They are a legacy tobacco company
[00:39.940 --> 00:43.300]  with operations in 30 different countries.
[00:43.300 --> 00:47.100]  They've got a grower network that really spans the globe.
[00:47.100 --> 00:50.620]  And really having their partnership is what enables us
[00:50.620 --> 00:52.820]  to do what we do across the country.
[00:52.820 --> 00:57.260]  And also, it helps with our being able to participate
[00:57.260 --> 00:58.900]  in research like Larry's.
[00:58.900 --> 01:00.820]  So it's been a lot of fun so far.
[01:00.820 --> 01:03.540]  And as Larry kind of alluded to,
[01:03.540 --> 01:06.460]  one of the key things in achieving profitability
[01:06.460 --> 01:08.900]  and making sure that you don't lose money on him
[01:08.900 --> 01:11.420]  is finding a company that's trustworthy
[01:11.420 --> 01:13.020]  that you can contract with.
[01:13.020 --> 01:15.580]  So there is going to be a surplus this year.
[01:15.580 --> 01:17.820]  I can assure you of that.
[01:17.820 --> 01:22.820]  However, a lot of that is because several companies
[01:23.180 --> 01:26.180]  are out there contracting thousands and thousands of acres
[01:26.180 --> 01:28.300]  with no real commercialization plan.
[01:28.300 --> 01:29.900]  And understand that it takes a lot of money
[01:29.900 --> 01:32.380]  to commercialize that amount of acreage.
[01:32.380 --> 01:36.580]  As you're looking through this budget that I passed out,
[01:36.580 --> 01:41.580]  on the back page, there's a table that assumes
[01:43.060 --> 01:47.700]  about half a pound of floral material per plant.
[01:47.700 --> 01:52.540]  So about 1,000 pounds of floral material per acre
[01:52.540 --> 01:55.060]  on our model that we're using in North Carolina.
[01:55.060 --> 01:57.540]  And you can see as your CBD percentages go up,
[01:57.540 --> 02:01.220]  this is assuming $3.50 per percentage point
[02:01.220 --> 02:02.540]  of CBD per pound.
[02:03.500 --> 02:07.140]  You can see as those percentage points go up,
[02:07.140 --> 02:10.260]  the monetary net value to the grower
[02:10.260 --> 02:12.060]  goes up pretty dramatically too.
[02:12.060 --> 02:13.900]  And taking a look at those gross numbers,
[02:13.900 --> 02:16.020]  so this is on a per acre basis.
[02:16.020 --> 02:18.820]  So if you had growers that were achieving
[02:18.820 --> 02:23.140]  1,000 pounds of floral material per acre at 10% CBD,
[02:23.140 --> 02:28.140]  I as a company have to pay out $35,000 per acre.
[02:28.500 --> 02:30.940]  Now think about that for a second.
[02:31.780 --> 02:34.660]  My company has to shell out $35,000 per acre.
[02:34.660 --> 02:37.940]  So if we're contracting 1,000 acres,
[02:38.820 --> 02:42.620]  what does my cash flow situation have to look like
[02:42.620 --> 02:44.320]  to be able to pay you, the grower?
[02:45.260 --> 02:46.500]  So that's problematic.
[02:46.500 --> 02:49.900]  So honestly, the first thing that you as a grower
[02:49.900 --> 02:53.100]  need to do to achieve profitability in your crop
[02:53.100 --> 02:57.220]  is sign a contract with a company that you know
[02:57.220 --> 03:01.340]  has the monetary resources to pay you
[03:01.340 --> 03:02.460]  at the end of the season.
[03:02.460 --> 03:04.420]  It's been a huge problem in North Carolina.
[03:04.420 --> 03:08.700]  I would say probably 40 to 50% of growers
[03:08.700 --> 03:11.300]  over the past two years have not been paid for their crop.
[03:11.300 --> 03:13.140]  And a lot of them are still sitting on it.
[03:13.140 --> 03:17.060]  Now, in a lot of situations, you can get sort of
[03:18.100 --> 03:21.620]  pulled into a situation where you are gonna get paid,
[03:21.620 --> 03:24.060]  but maybe you're getting paid half in oil.
[03:24.060 --> 03:26.180]  Well, and that's fine.
[03:26.180 --> 03:29.340]  If you have a commercialization plan for that oil,
[03:29.340 --> 03:31.820]  if you're planning on starting your own brand,
[03:31.820 --> 03:33.420]  something like that,
[03:33.420 --> 03:37.660]  that might be fine in your business model.
[03:37.660 --> 03:40.860]  But understand, if you're planning on supplying that oil
[03:40.860 --> 03:43.020]  as a raw ingredient to a formulator,
[03:43.020 --> 03:45.420]  generally speaking, formulators that are buying
[03:45.420 --> 03:48.460]  dramatic amounts of raw ingredients
[03:48.460 --> 03:51.420]  don't wanna piecemeal it from farm to farm.
[03:51.420 --> 03:54.300]  And then another thing that you have to take into account
[03:54.300 --> 03:55.980]  is the looming regulation.
[03:56.780 --> 03:58.620]  Once the FDA gets involved with this,
[03:58.620 --> 04:03.620]  everybody who's manufacturing products from these oils
[04:03.620 --> 04:07.780]  is gonna have to comply with 21 CFR Part 111 or Part 117,
[04:07.780 --> 04:11.300]  whichever it shakes out to be.
[04:11.300 --> 04:14.500]  And there's a cost associated with that regulatory burden,
[04:14.500 --> 04:16.580]  and it's not an insignificant cost.
[04:16.580 --> 04:20.180]  So as you're planning what you're gonna do with your farm,
[04:20.180 --> 04:22.980]  just make sure you're taking these things into account
[04:22.980 --> 04:24.380]  in your business model.
[04:24.380 --> 04:27.180]  And this is not a cheap crop to raise.
[04:27.180 --> 04:30.300]  You can look through here in this budget,
[04:32.220 --> 04:35.700]  and assuming $4 per plant,
[04:35.700 --> 04:37.940]  if you're on a four by six spacing,
[04:37.940 --> 04:40.260]  which is typical down in North Carolina
[04:40.260 --> 04:42.660]  depending on your planting date,
[04:42.660 --> 04:47.100]  just your plant cost per acre is gonna run you $7,200.
[04:49.580 --> 04:51.620]  That's on a per acre basis, folks.
[04:51.620 --> 04:54.380]  So this is not a cheap crop to raise
[04:54.380 --> 04:55.820]  if you're raising it for CBD.
[04:56.940 --> 04:59.620]  Then you get into things like analytical testing fees.
[04:59.620 --> 05:03.500]  So we have $300 down here for analytical testing fees.
[05:03.500 --> 05:05.340]  I would assume that if you're doing it right,
[05:05.340 --> 05:07.660]  you're probably gonna spend significantly more
[05:07.660 --> 05:11.820]  than that $300 on those testing fees.
[05:11.820 --> 05:15.460]  But then if you go over to the next page,
[05:15.460 --> 05:16.700]  where it really gets,
[05:17.220 --> 05:21.860]  here's where on your farm you can make the most impact
[05:21.860 --> 05:24.020]  in your cost of production right now,
[05:24.020 --> 05:26.300]  and that's on labor costs.
[05:26.300 --> 05:28.500]  So there are a lot of innovative things
[05:28.500 --> 05:30.260]  coming out right now.
[05:30.260 --> 05:33.540]  Granville equipment, which, anyone here familiar
[05:33.540 --> 05:35.580]  with a company called Granville Equipment?
[05:36.620 --> 05:37.620]  I figured probably not.
[05:37.620 --> 05:39.060]  They're big in the tobacco space.
[05:39.060 --> 05:41.220]  So they're out of Roxborough, North Carolina.
[05:41.220 --> 05:43.860]  They recently came up with a piece of equipment
[05:43.860 --> 05:48.860]  that essentially bucks the crop on a massive scale.
[05:49.660 --> 05:53.300]  So it dramatically mechanizes the operation
[05:53.300 --> 05:56.340]  as far as removing the floral material from the stalks.
[05:56.340 --> 06:00.100]  And you can see in here, so your total labor costs,
[06:00.100 --> 06:01.460]  if you're doing everything by hand,
[06:01.460 --> 06:03.420]  and all of these numbers were generated
[06:03.420 --> 06:05.620]  from sitting down with our growers
[06:05.620 --> 06:08.060]  and putting a really sharp pencil
[06:08.060 --> 06:11.140]  to what their costs were over the past couple of years.
[06:11.140 --> 06:13.700]  So you can see, if you're doing everything by hand,
[06:14.540 --> 06:18.580]  you're looking at $4,170 as far as your labor costs
[06:18.580 --> 06:20.500]  from start to finish.
[06:20.500 --> 06:22.100]  That Granville piece of equipment
[06:22.940 --> 06:26.780]  cuts your labor costs down to $1,357.50.
[06:26.780 --> 06:29.380]  Now, that's a dramatic savings.
[06:29.380 --> 06:32.860]  Understand that that piece of equipment costs $42,000,
[06:32.860 --> 06:35.340]  but just in labor savings alone,
[06:35.340 --> 06:37.500]  if you have 15 acres of hemp out in the field,
[06:37.500 --> 06:40.220]  that piece of equipment pays for itself year one
[06:40.220 --> 06:41.580]  in labor savings alone.
[06:42.580 --> 06:45.540]  This market is going to continue to commoditize.
[06:45.540 --> 06:49.260]  As these products become more readily available,
[06:49.260 --> 06:51.380]  as more material comes onto the market,
[06:51.380 --> 06:53.420]  the price is gonna continue to go down.
[06:53.420 --> 06:57.140]  So you as a grower need to be thinking right now
[06:57.140 --> 07:00.380]  how you are going to reduce your costs
[07:00.380 --> 07:03.020]  in producing this crop over the next few years.
[07:03.020 --> 07:05.500]  And some of those input costs
[07:05.500 --> 07:07.380]  are starting to take care of themselves.
[07:07.380 --> 07:09.180]  We've seen in North Carolina,
[07:09.420 --> 07:14.300]  clones go from up to $14 a plant in 2016,
[07:14.300 --> 07:15.740]  the first year of our program,
[07:15.740 --> 07:18.420]  down to $4 a plant this year.
[07:18.420 --> 07:20.620]  Now, a lot of that was collective negotiating
[07:20.620 --> 07:24.020]  on our part for our grower base,
[07:24.020 --> 07:28.260]  but understand those prices are coming down.
[07:28.260 --> 07:31.980]  And honestly, I feel that the biggest way
[07:31.980 --> 07:36.540]  to cut your costs in plants right now is to go to seed.
[07:36.580 --> 07:39.300]  There are a number of reputable seed companies out there
[07:39.300 --> 07:40.900]  producing high CBD seed.
[07:40.900 --> 07:42.620]  Oregon CBD happens to be
[07:43.940 --> 07:47.100]  what a lot of our growers are using currently.
[07:47.100 --> 07:50.940]  But going from seed and going from even a $4 clone
[07:50.940 --> 07:55.940]  to a dollar seed is a dramatic savings for your farm.
[07:56.020 --> 07:58.940]  Now, understand that, and I don't know,
[07:58.940 --> 08:00.500]  I don't know if Larry's tried it at all,
[08:00.500 --> 08:04.340]  but nobody that I know of has had success
[08:04.340 --> 08:05.580]  in direct seeding these.
[08:05.580 --> 08:08.180]  So that dollar per plant is not gonna be
[08:08.180 --> 08:10.620]  your all-in cost in your plants.
[08:10.620 --> 08:14.080]  Generally speaking, you're gonna have to make a transplant
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.460]  out of those seeds, but even if you're a $1.25 in all-in,
[08:18.460 --> 08:20.980]  that's better than $4 per plant.
[08:20.980 --> 08:24.260]  So mechanization, plant costs,
[08:24.260 --> 08:27.340]  that is the, those are the two biggest ways right now
[08:27.340 --> 08:31.260]  that you as a grower can start dropping your cost
[08:31.260 --> 08:32.620]  in this crop.
[08:32.620 --> 08:33.580]  Does that make sense to everyone?
[08:33.580 --> 08:35.580]  Does anyone have any questions on that?
[08:36.660 --> 08:38.580]  What was the name of the machine again?
[08:38.580 --> 08:41.820]  So, Grand Bull Equipment is the company,
[08:41.820 --> 08:43.860]  and it's actually got it on here.
[08:43.860 --> 08:47.060]  I think they're just calling it their hemp thrasher,
[08:47.060 --> 08:48.540]  but they have a website.
[08:49.460 --> 08:51.500]  If you Google them, it'll pull it right up.
[08:51.500 --> 08:52.860]  Thank you.
[08:52.860 --> 08:54.300]  Any other questions?
[08:54.300 --> 08:55.140]  Yes, ma'am?
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.200]  Yes, ma'am, Oregon CBD takes a lot of pride in what they do.
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.160]  They only put out F1 seeds, and their varieties have,
[09:10.160 --> 09:13.520]  in multiple states, met that legal threshold
[09:13.520 --> 09:15.080]  for several years now.
[09:15.080 --> 09:17.360]  And that brings up a good point,
[09:17.360 --> 09:19.680]  because you can get online right now
[09:19.680 --> 09:22.720]  and find 15 different seed companies.
[09:22.720 --> 09:25.320]  How do you know which of them are reputable?
[09:25.320 --> 09:27.540]  Well, that's kind of difficult right now.
[09:27.540 --> 09:30.880]  I'll tell you that Oregon CBD, twice this past year,
[09:30.880 --> 09:33.760]  crashed their website and made $8 million
[09:33.760 --> 09:36.880]  in three minutes when they released seed
[09:36.880 --> 09:38.360]  onto their website.
[09:38.360 --> 09:41.520]  That tells me that they're probably fairly reputable.
[09:41.520 --> 09:42.920]  They have actual sales.
[09:42.920 --> 09:45.000]  We have folks that have these varieties
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.240]  out in the field right now,
[09:46.240 --> 09:48.640]  and they've performed well the past couple of years.
[09:48.640 --> 09:50.920]  So, as you're going through your vetting process
[09:50.920 --> 09:54.200]  for your farm, just do as much research as possible
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.960]  as to who's grown those varieties,
[09:56.960 --> 09:58.520]  who's bought seed from that company,
[09:58.520 --> 09:59.800]  because there are a lot of horror stories
[09:59.800 --> 10:01.280]  out there right now.
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.200]  I'm not sure if growing techniques related
[10:03.200 --> 10:05.160]  to cultivars are in place.
[10:05.160 --> 10:06.920]  I guess it would have to be one way
[10:06.920 --> 10:10.040]  to differentiate your product in the future,
[10:10.040 --> 10:13.200]  because I noticed that there are some cultivars
[10:13.200 --> 10:15.320]  that are emerging that need to be
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.880]  more controlled environments.
[10:20.580 --> 10:24.340]  Yeah, the question was, are a lot of these growing practices
[10:24.340 --> 10:27.660]  varietal specific, and do those different varieties
[10:27.660 --> 10:31.380]  have sort of a different place in the market moving forward?
[10:32.060 --> 10:34.380]  I absolutely think that they do.
[10:34.380 --> 10:37.660]  So, you're starting to see more folks put research
[10:37.660 --> 10:42.660]  into CBG dominant varieties, into CBC dominant varieties.
[10:42.740 --> 10:44.980]  And that's gonna play a huge role
[10:44.980 --> 10:46.220]  in the market moving forward,
[10:46.220 --> 10:49.060]  because CBD is commoditizing.
[10:49.060 --> 10:52.860]  Isolated CBG is actually selling
[10:52.860 --> 10:54.180]  at a decent premium right now.
[10:54.180 --> 10:58.860]  But the cheapest way to get large amounts of CBG
[10:58.860 --> 11:01.940]  is not to isolate it out of the extract
[11:01.940 --> 11:04.700]  from CBD dominant varieties,
[11:04.700 --> 11:08.060]  because you're talking about fractions of a percentage point
[11:08.060 --> 11:10.900]  as far as your yield off of that extraction.
[11:10.900 --> 11:13.620]  The cheapest way and the best way to commercialize
[11:13.620 --> 11:17.860]  those other cannabinoids is to go through a breeding process
[11:17.860 --> 11:19.940]  and get plants that are dominant
[11:19.940 --> 11:22.500]  in the production of those cannabinoids.
[11:22.500 --> 11:24.660]  Now, I don't think that we're quite there yet,
[11:24.660 --> 11:25.900]  but it's coming.
[11:25.900 --> 11:28.940]  And I think that's a very good point to think about
[11:28.940 --> 11:32.220]  as you're thinking about your plan for your farm.
[11:32.220 --> 11:34.340]  Does that answer your question?
[11:34.340 --> 11:35.180]  All right.
[11:36.260 --> 11:37.100]  Yes, sir.
[11:37.100 --> 11:43.360]  Do you think indoor or greenhouse?
[11:43.360 --> 11:45.840]  So, the question was,
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.520]  is an indoor or greenhouse environment
[11:49.520 --> 11:51.360]  better for CBD production?
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.560]  And I'll tell you this,
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.320]  as far as controlling it for contaminants,
[11:56.320 --> 11:58.080]  it's definitely beneficial.
[11:59.080 --> 12:01.360]  But it just costs us thinking much more.
[12:01.360 --> 12:03.400]  And as this continues to commoditize,
[12:03.400 --> 12:06.680]  now, there's certain market segments
[12:06.680 --> 12:10.280]  that are probably going to demand that indoor production,
[12:10.280 --> 12:12.560]  but they're very small market segments.
[12:12.560 --> 12:15.360]  If you can find one of those market segments
[12:15.360 --> 12:17.720]  that works for you and your farm,
[12:17.720 --> 12:19.200]  then I'd say go for it.
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.880]  But with the cost of lighting,
[12:22.040 --> 12:23.880]  honestly, right now,
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.400]  if you're just selling to a company
[12:25.400 --> 12:27.000]  that's processing for CBD,
[12:27.080 --> 12:30.680]  it's probably not profitable.
[12:31.960 --> 12:34.360]  And it probably is going to get less profitable
[12:34.360 --> 12:37.560]  as it continues to commoditize.
[12:37.560 --> 12:40.520]  So, an example of a market segment?
[12:40.520 --> 12:45.320]  Well, so we don't do any kind of smoke-filled products.
[12:45.320 --> 12:46.640]  My company doesn't.
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.440]  But those products make up about 20%
[12:50.440 --> 12:52.560]  of the products that are on retail shelves
[12:52.560 --> 12:54.120]  in North Carolina right now.
[12:54.120 --> 12:56.320]  And when you're talking about a smoke-filled product,
[12:56.480 --> 12:59.960]  it absolutely has to be produced in a controlled environment
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.880]  to mitigate things like mold, mycotoxins, things like that.
[13:06.280 --> 13:09.600]  So, it's much easier to control that in a greenhouse,
[13:09.600 --> 13:14.240]  or better yet, a full-on indoor growth facility
[13:14.240 --> 13:16.000]  than it is outdoors.
[13:18.200 --> 13:19.040]  Yes, sir?
[13:19.040 --> 13:22.360]  Is the harvesting and drying process...
[13:28.760 --> 13:30.440]  The question was,
[13:30.440 --> 13:33.800]  is the drying and harvesting process standardized,
[13:33.800 --> 13:35.280]  or is it evolving?
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.200]  The quick, down-and-dirty answer is it's definitely evolving.
[13:39.200 --> 13:42.960]  I can tell you what's working for us in North Carolina.
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.200]  Right now, there's not a lot of mechanization
[13:45.200 --> 13:46.680]  as far as the harvest is concerned.
[13:46.680 --> 13:49.360]  Most folks are cutting plants by hand,
[13:49.360 --> 13:52.960]  but there is a significant amount of infrastructure,
[13:52.960 --> 13:55.120]  particularly in eastern North Carolina,
[13:56.120 --> 13:59.120]  that's been transferred from the tobacco industry
[13:59.120 --> 14:00.280]  into the hemp industry.
[14:00.280 --> 14:02.720]  So, we have these things called bulk barns.
[14:02.720 --> 14:05.520]  And what it is is it's...
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.200]  It looks like a shipping container,
[14:10.200 --> 14:12.320]  but you're forcing air through the product,
[14:12.320 --> 14:13.920]  whether it be tobacco or hemp.
[14:13.920 --> 14:15.320]  And you can add heat to it, too.
[14:15.320 --> 14:17.560]  So, with these tobacco barns,
[14:17.560 --> 14:20.200]  which are already on farm in North Carolina,
[14:21.040 --> 14:25.240]  you can take a crop that's 40% moisture in the field
[14:25.240 --> 14:27.920]  and dry it down to 8% moisture,
[14:27.920 --> 14:30.640]  which is optimal for our extraction methodology
[14:30.640 --> 14:32.440]  in about three days.
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.440]  And it really helps mitigate development of mold
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.800]  and things like that after you've harvested.
[14:40.800 --> 14:42.600]  We had a lot of guys our first year
[14:42.600 --> 14:46.520]  that tried to just hang it up and let it dry naturally.
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.520]  And unfortunately, I think you guys
[14:48.800 --> 14:50.760]  have the same problem up here.
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.320]  The humidity is certainly not conducive to it.
[14:54.320 --> 14:58.600]  And you develop quite a dramatic amount of mold.
[14:58.600 --> 15:02.960]  So, really, now I've seen folks do the same thing
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.800]  in a sweet potato curing facility.
[15:04.800 --> 15:05.840]  Works just as well.
[15:05.840 --> 15:08.440]  I can't tell you that one way of drying
[15:08.440 --> 15:09.360]  is better than the other.
[15:09.360 --> 15:12.480]  All I can give you is what's working for our growers.
[15:12.480 --> 15:13.320]  Yes, ma'am?
[15:13.320 --> 15:15.160]  Would the product strip before going through
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.800]  the container and drying?
[15:16.800 --> 15:17.960]  Is it a separate step?
[15:17.960 --> 15:19.040]  No, ma'am.
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.040]  They're putting whole plants in these tobacco mounds
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.240]  and then they're stripping it post-drying.
[15:26.240 --> 15:28.880]  It's a lot easier to strip the dry material
[15:28.880 --> 15:30.920]  than it is to strip wet material.
[15:32.320 --> 15:33.160]  Yes, sir?
[15:34.120 --> 15:34.960]  I have a question.
[15:34.960 --> 15:37.940]  Where do you make your product?
[15:37.940 --> 15:40.780]  Do you specify how much of that is for CBD
[15:40.780 --> 15:45.010]  or for grain, fire, grass, or?
[15:45.010 --> 15:45.850]  Yes, and then secondly,
[15:45.850 --> 15:50.940]  does that mean to be that your company
[15:50.940 --> 15:53.500]  is great enough, I guess, to sign a contract
[15:53.500 --> 15:55.940]  with a guaranteed return at this point in time?
[15:55.940 --> 15:58.980]  And if so, what might that formula look like?
[15:58.980 --> 16:00.060]  If you wanted to share that.
[16:00.060 --> 16:02.900]  Yeah, that's a real good question.
[16:02.900 --> 16:05.380]  I really, I don't know if you know the split
[16:05.380 --> 16:08.700]  as far as CBD versus grain and fiber.
[16:08.700 --> 16:12.300]  I tend to really just focus on the CBD economics.
[16:12.300 --> 16:14.380]  I can tell you that I would assume
[16:14.380 --> 16:17.140]  that a dramatic amount of that 400,000 acres
[16:17.140 --> 16:20.260]  is for CBD, the vast majority of it.
[16:20.260 --> 16:22.420]  Because the markets just really haven't been developed
[16:22.420 --> 16:24.900]  for grain and fiber down here in the US yet.
[16:24.900 --> 16:27.780]  You have some companies like Sunstrand,
[16:27.780 --> 16:29.780]  who has facilities up and running,
[16:29.780 --> 16:31.980]  both in the US and in Canada,
[16:31.980 --> 16:34.740]  and I think in Uruguay too, at this point,
[16:34.740 --> 16:36.620]  that are working on commercializing fiber.
[16:36.620 --> 16:39.380]  But the markets just aren't there yet.
[16:40.700 --> 16:42.580]  And excuse me, what was the second part of your question?
[16:42.580 --> 16:44.740]  Oh, the contracts, the contracts.
[16:44.740 --> 16:49.260]  So we contracted out acreage across four states this year.
[16:49.260 --> 16:52.420]  And we signed a binding contract with our growers
[16:52.420 --> 16:57.420]  that they will receive $3.50 per percentage point
[16:57.740 --> 17:02.740]  of dry, or per percentage point of CBD by dry weight,
[17:02.940 --> 17:05.420]  per pound of material that's available to us.
[17:05.420 --> 17:07.220]  Is it dry, is it 8% or 10%?
[17:07.220 --> 17:09.180]  8% is considered dry.
[17:10.540 --> 17:12.380]  Yep, that's what those numbers are based on.
[17:12.380 --> 17:14.740]  Those numbers are based on our contract price.
[17:15.940 --> 17:16.780]  Yes, sir?
[17:16.780 --> 17:17.900]  Is there a certified organic deal
[17:17.900 --> 17:20.220]  to increase that twice per percentage point?
[17:20.220 --> 17:24.980]  Yeah, and that's a good, if you have organic land,
[17:25.900 --> 17:29.500]  that is a good niche to go for.
[17:29.500 --> 17:33.140]  We did some certified organic contracting this year,
[17:33.140 --> 17:36.380]  and it was at a multiple of that number.
[17:36.380 --> 17:38.900]  But I think some folks were sort of disappointed
[17:38.900 --> 17:41.660]  in the multiple, because if you're talking about
[17:41.660 --> 17:44.100]  organic tobacco versus conventional tobacco,
[17:44.100 --> 17:48.460]  it's usually a 1.8x multiplier on the price.
[17:48.460 --> 17:52.700]  Well, ours wasn't anywhere near a 1.8x multiplier,
[17:52.700 --> 17:56.700]  because essentially, our production methodology,
[17:56.700 --> 17:59.900]  even if you're conventionally producing this crop,
[17:59.900 --> 18:02.860]  you're still using mostly organic practices.
[18:02.860 --> 18:05.260]  Really, what we're paying a premium for
[18:05.260 --> 18:07.020]  is the certification on the land.
[18:07.020 --> 18:08.900]  So it definitely was worthwhile,
[18:08.900 --> 18:11.540]  and we got good participation in that.
[18:11.540 --> 18:16.540]  But it's nowhere near two times the contracted price.
[18:34.800 --> 18:38.040]  Well, and realistically, the question was about
[18:39.520 --> 18:42.800]  pulling the formal material off the plant pre-drying.
[18:42.800 --> 18:45.880]  And I'm not gonna tell you that that doesn't work,
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.240]  but it's much easier for our growers
[18:49.240 --> 18:51.680]  to throw the whole plant in a tobacco barn,
[18:51.680 --> 18:54.480]  and then as they're pulling the plants out of the tobacco barn
[18:54.480 --> 18:56.240]  they're stripping the formal material off,
[18:56.240 --> 18:58.480]  and then packaging it to come to us.
[18:58.480 --> 19:00.800]  And that mitigates a lot of your concerns with mold,
[19:00.800 --> 19:02.620]  because you're going straight from
[19:02.620 --> 19:04.320]  that controlled environment
[19:04.320 --> 19:06.520]  directly into the package to come to us.
[19:11.560 --> 19:15.120]  No, really haven't had any problems with that so far.
[19:15.120 --> 19:15.960]  Yes, sir?
[19:19.240 --> 19:23.020]  I'm not sure.
[19:23.020 --> 19:25.940]  So the question is, are there set parameters
[19:25.940 --> 19:27.660]  for drying the plant as far as temperature,
[19:27.660 --> 19:29.380]  humidity, things like that?
[19:29.380 --> 19:32.300]  Once again, I can't tell you that it's locked down
[19:32.300 --> 19:33.260]  to a science right now.
[19:33.260 --> 19:36.860]  What's working for our guys is pushing air
[19:36.860 --> 19:39.900]  that's about 10 degrees above ambient,
[19:39.900 --> 19:41.820]  and that is generally mitigating
[19:41.820 --> 19:44.380]  a lot of those humidity concerns.
[19:44.900 --> 19:46.740]  Anything without dehumidifying,
[19:46.740 --> 19:48.940]  like dehumidifying the product,
[19:48.940 --> 19:50.780]  and then drying it or doing something?
[19:50.780 --> 19:53.980]  I've seen some dehumidifiers used,
[19:53.980 --> 19:55.740]  but in those tobacco barns,
[19:55.740 --> 19:57.140]  if you're adding a little bit of heat
[19:57.140 --> 20:00.380]  and keeping the temperature of that air
[20:00.380 --> 20:01.700]  that you're forcing through the product
[20:01.700 --> 20:03.940]  about 10 degrees above ambient pressure,
[20:03.940 --> 20:06.540]  and not running the air when it's raining outside
[20:06.540 --> 20:07.900]  or something like that,
[20:07.900 --> 20:10.780]  generally that's gonna keep your humidity fairly low.
[20:11.620 --> 20:12.460]  One more question.
[20:12.460 --> 20:14.020]  One more question.
[20:14.700 --> 20:15.540]  Yes ma'am.
[20:15.540 --> 20:21.430]  So a very good question.
[20:21.430 --> 20:23.230]  Who's responsible for the transportation?
[20:23.230 --> 20:25.310]  And right now the growers are responsible
[20:25.310 --> 20:27.270]  for the transportation.
[20:27.270 --> 20:28.750]  What I can tell you is we're looking
[20:28.750 --> 20:31.950]  at logistical solutions to make that easier on growers.
[20:31.950 --> 20:35.270]  So for instance, moving into a market like New York.
[20:36.350 --> 20:39.350]  Just the same way that our partners do in tobacco,
[20:39.350 --> 20:42.750]  what we're looking at is setting up remote buying stations
[20:42.750 --> 20:44.870]  in those different markets that we're contracting in.
[20:44.870 --> 20:46.550]  We're not quite there yet,
[20:46.550 --> 20:48.950]  but I would assume that next year or the year after
[20:48.950 --> 20:50.910]  as we continue to expand,
[20:50.910 --> 20:54.110]  if we continue to expand, that's gonna be the model.
[20:55.110 --> 20:56.070]  Thank you all very much.
[20:56.070 --> 20:57.710]  I'll be around.
[20:57.710 --> 20:59.030]  Come find me if you need me.
[20:59.030 --> 21:06.520]  Okay, we're gonna kick off our discussion of research
[21:08.400 --> 21:11.360]  with two folks working in my lab.
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.680]  They're gonna tag team this presentation
[21:13.680 --> 21:17.800]  talking about our results from our CBD hemp trial
[21:17.800 --> 21:20.880]  from last year and some of the concerns
[21:20.880 --> 21:24.800]  that you should have about acquiring seed
[21:24.800 --> 21:28.760]  and achieving compliance for THC.
[21:30.360 --> 21:32.760]  So George going first.
[21:32.760 --> 21:35.680]  George Stack just graduated
[21:35.680 --> 21:37.960]  with his Bachelor of Science from Cornell.
[21:37.960 --> 21:40.640]  So he's actually talking about work that he did
[21:40.640 --> 21:42.480]  as an undergraduate in my lab.
[21:42.480 --> 21:45.280]  And he will tag team with Jacob Toth,
[21:45.280 --> 21:47.840]  who is a new PhD student.
[21:47.840 --> 21:51.000]  George also is about to start his PhD.
[21:51.960 --> 21:55.320]  So George, so they are working off of the handout
[21:55.320 --> 22:00.320]  that we gave out, the 2018 cannabinoid production handout.
[22:00.880 --> 22:02.200]  Okay, George.
[22:09.770 --> 22:11.530]  All right, can everybody hear me?
[22:11.530 --> 22:12.370]  Good?
[22:13.210 --> 22:15.890]  Yeah, so Jacob and I are gonna be talking about
[22:15.890 --> 22:17.690]  two, actually three sets of trials
[22:17.730 --> 22:20.730]  that we conducted last summer.
[22:20.730 --> 22:22.970]  Last summer, this is better?
[22:22.970 --> 22:24.290]  Okay.
[22:24.290 --> 22:27.290]  That we conducted last summer across New York State
[22:27.290 --> 22:29.890]  and that we ended up quantifying cannabinoids for.
[22:31.250 --> 22:34.290]  So we'll break down those two sets of trials,
[22:34.290 --> 22:36.250]  two major sets of trials first.
[22:36.250 --> 22:39.370]  One was the brain fiber and neopurbis trial,
[22:39.370 --> 22:42.090]  which had 33 different varieties
[22:42.090 --> 22:46.730]  from the United States, Canada, and Europe in it.
[22:46.730 --> 22:48.690]  It was replicated six times across the state
[22:48.690 --> 22:51.890]  with the yellow dots on the map there.
[22:51.890 --> 22:55.170]  So twice in Geneva, twice in Ithaca,
[22:55.170 --> 22:58.330]  once in Shazie and once down in Long Island at Riverhead.
[22:58.330 --> 23:01.250]  So we covered the entire latitudinal range
[23:01.250 --> 23:02.930]  of New York State.
[23:02.930 --> 23:07.210]  And you'll hear more about that from Jamie this afternoon.
[23:07.210 --> 23:11.050]  And that was planted, direct seeded with a small plot,
[23:11.050 --> 23:12.850]  grain drilled, four reps,
[23:12.850 --> 23:16.850]  walked into early maturing grain,
[23:16.850 --> 23:18.730]  dual purpose grain and fiber varieties,
[23:18.730 --> 23:23.730]  and later maturing fiber varieties.
[23:23.770 --> 23:25.610]  That was planted in the middle of June
[23:25.610 --> 23:28.250]  and harvested throughout September.
[23:28.250 --> 23:29.610]  The other major set of trials that we did
[23:29.610 --> 23:32.770]  was a cannabinoid trial, which was replicated twice,
[23:32.770 --> 23:36.370]  once in Geneva and once in Ithaca.
[23:36.370 --> 23:39.450]  So those were transferred in the greenhouse
[23:39.450 --> 23:41.730]  and transplanted into black plastic.
[23:41.730 --> 23:45.170]  There was 15 different varieties started in that trial.
[23:45.170 --> 23:48.050]  They were started from mixed male and female seeds.
[23:48.050 --> 23:50.250]  All of the plants were transplanted into the field
[23:50.250 --> 23:52.570]  and then the males were called out in the field.
[23:53.930 --> 23:55.490]  And then towards the end of the year,
[23:55.490 --> 23:56.810]  once the plants were flowering,
[23:56.810 --> 24:00.170]  we collected floral tissue for cannabinoid analysis.
[24:00.170 --> 24:02.410]  And there was kind of three different reasons we did that.
[24:02.410 --> 24:04.410]  One was to measure THC,
[24:04.410 --> 24:08.210]  which is important for staying under regulatory levels.
[24:08.210 --> 24:10.570]  The other measuring CBD, which is important
[24:10.570 --> 24:11.490]  because that's your bottom line,
[24:12.250 --> 24:13.090]  that's where you're gonna get paid for.
[24:13.090 --> 24:16.010]  And then the third was measuring other minor cannabinoids,
[24:16.010 --> 24:19.130]  which kind of Scott alluded to in his talk,
[24:19.130 --> 24:21.570]  to see if there was any potential for lines
[24:21.570 --> 24:24.570]  that would be better at producing those minor cannabinoids.
[24:24.570 --> 24:25.690]  So I'm gonna turn it over to Jacob
[24:25.690 --> 24:29.850]  to talk about our HPLC and cannabinoid analysis.
[24:29.850 --> 24:31.330]  Thank you, George.
[24:31.330 --> 24:32.330]  So as George was mentioning,
[24:32.330 --> 24:35.010]  we use HPLC to measure the cannabinoids
[24:35.010 --> 24:37.530]  for our various different entries.
[24:37.570 --> 24:42.210]  We tested CBD, THC, CBC, CBG,
[24:42.210 --> 24:43.850]  and their corresponding acids.
[24:43.850 --> 24:47.530]  We also tested Delta H, THC, and CBN,
[24:47.530 --> 24:50.090]  but we didn't find any of those cannabinoids
[24:50.090 --> 24:51.850]  in any of our samples.
[24:51.850 --> 24:53.530]  To calculate the total potential,
[24:53.530 --> 24:55.530]  we multiplied the corresponding acid form
[24:55.530 --> 24:59.370]  of either THC or CBD by 0.877,
[24:59.370 --> 25:02.330]  and that's what's shown in the bar plot
[25:02.330 --> 25:03.690]  at the bottom of the page.
[25:04.050 --> 25:07.770]  So the grade fiber and dual,
[25:07.770 --> 25:09.770]  these are sort of representative samples
[25:09.770 --> 25:13.850]  from 10 plants, 10 female plants that we harvested,
[25:13.850 --> 25:16.130]  while the CBD and pollination trials
[25:16.130 --> 25:19.290]  were the averages of individual plants.
[25:19.290 --> 25:23.890]  As you can see, we had some grade fiber and dual cultivars
[25:23.890 --> 25:28.890]  that tested above the legal limit of 0.3 THC.
[25:29.010 --> 25:32.890]  The dotted line there is 0.3 total potential THC,
[25:32.890 --> 25:35.210]  and if you look at our CBD varieties,
[25:35.210 --> 25:36.410]  everything tested hot.
[25:37.330 --> 25:40.730]  So looking at the individual plants in the CBD trial,
[25:40.730 --> 25:42.690]  we found three distinct groups.
[25:42.690 --> 25:45.010]  If you plotted the total potential THC
[25:45.010 --> 25:46.610]  versus total potential CBD,
[25:46.610 --> 25:49.690]  and that's in the scatter plot in the other bottom corner,
[25:49.690 --> 25:53.890]  the first group is in red,
[25:53.890 --> 25:58.010]  and it was mostly THC, very little CBD.
[25:58.010 --> 26:00.250]  We're calling that the marijuana type.
[26:00.250 --> 26:01.890]  The second group in green
[26:01.890 --> 26:05.130]  had about equal amounts of THC and CBD.
[26:06.090 --> 26:07.930]  We're calling that the heterozygous type.
[26:07.930 --> 26:09.930]  And then the third group in blue
[26:09.930 --> 26:14.930]  is about 20 to 25 to one CBD to THC.
[26:17.010 --> 26:20.050]  Using published genetic data
[26:20.050 --> 26:23.050]  on the gene sequences of the cannabinoid synthases,
[26:23.050 --> 26:24.810]  we were able to develop a molecular marker
[26:24.810 --> 26:28.130]  which mapped on directly to these three groups,
[26:28.130 --> 26:30.170]  and that's what gives you the color there.
[26:31.970 --> 26:35.810]  So what we can say summarized in the first paragraph,
[26:35.810 --> 26:37.690]  it looks like the marijuana types
[26:37.690 --> 26:39.250]  have two marijuana copies.
[26:39.250 --> 26:42.690]  The heterozygotes have one marijuana copy, one hemp copy,
[26:42.690 --> 26:46.330]  and then the hemp types have two hemp copies.
[26:47.610 --> 26:49.770]  So what was really interesting here
[26:49.770 --> 26:54.450]  is that we found a pretty consistent 20 to 25 to one ratio
[26:54.450 --> 26:56.370]  in the hemp type.
[26:56.370 --> 26:59.690]  So that means if we're going for a 0.3%
[26:59.690 --> 27:01.890]  total potential THC,
[27:01.890 --> 27:06.370]  we can't get much over around six or 7% total CBD
[27:06.370 --> 27:09.970]  without getting above 0.3% total potential THC,
[27:10.930 --> 27:13.810]  which is potentially a very large problem.
[27:15.450 --> 27:16.930]  So with this molecular marker,
[27:16.930 --> 27:19.290]  one thing that we found that was very interesting
[27:19.290 --> 27:21.210]  was that we found these heterozygotes
[27:21.210 --> 27:23.410]  in nearly every cultivar that we tested.
[27:24.330 --> 27:26.650]  We only tested a few cultivars,
[27:26.650 --> 27:28.210]  and they're listed on the back,
[27:29.050 --> 27:31.570]  but I don't think there's any reason to suspect
[27:31.570 --> 27:34.930]  that those are special in being the only cultivars
[27:34.930 --> 27:36.170]  that are going to be segregated
[27:36.170 --> 27:38.850]  for this marijuana type cannabinoid synthase.
[27:40.570 --> 27:44.090]  In any case, it's going to be a future breeding effort of ours
[27:44.090 --> 27:48.010]  to make sure that all future hemp varieties
[27:48.010 --> 27:49.730]  are going to be actual hemp
[27:49.730 --> 27:52.890]  and not have any marijuana type cannabinoid synthases.
[27:53.250 --> 27:55.650]  Here's George to talk about the pollination study.
[27:56.690 --> 28:00.650]  Yeah, so the third trial that we did
[28:00.650 --> 28:03.610]  was just in Geneva last summer,
[28:03.610 --> 28:08.490]  and we were looking at how distance from a pollen source
[28:08.490 --> 28:09.890]  affected cannabinoid content,
[28:09.890 --> 28:11.650]  which is a pretty important concern.
[28:11.650 --> 28:13.330]  I'm sure many of you are familiar
[28:13.330 --> 28:15.370]  that there's anecdotal evidence
[28:15.370 --> 28:18.490]  that once cannabis plants are pollinated,
[28:18.490 --> 28:21.130]  their levels of cannabinoids go down dramatically.
[28:22.130 --> 28:24.410]  So we decided to conduct this trial last year
[28:24.410 --> 28:29.170]  to gauge maybe how far or how much of a decrease
[28:29.170 --> 28:31.650]  farmers could expect if there was a pollen source
[28:31.650 --> 28:32.490]  near their field.
[28:33.930 --> 28:36.490]  So what we did is we planted a three-acre plot
[28:36.490 --> 28:40.290]  of a monoecious dual-purpose grain and fiber variety
[28:40.290 --> 28:41.810]  called Anca.
[28:41.810 --> 28:43.290]  You can see that in the center of the map
[28:43.290 --> 28:44.930]  on the back of your handout there.
[28:46.010 --> 28:49.890]  And then we put many smaller micro plots
[28:49.890 --> 28:53.330]  in the four cardinal directions around the plot.
[28:53.330 --> 28:55.970]  So we had the controls, a ring at 200,
[28:55.970 --> 28:58.530]  some at around 500, one at 1,500,
[28:58.530 --> 29:02.410]  and then our cannabinoid CBD trial
[29:02.410 --> 29:05.450]  was not on the map, but a further away control.
[29:06.970 --> 29:10.930]  So now I'll point you down to the nice scatter plots
[29:10.930 --> 29:12.330]  on the bottom.
[29:12.330 --> 29:13.650]  So the first one on the left,
[29:13.650 --> 29:17.370]  you can see as the distance from the pollen source increased
[29:17.370 --> 29:19.930]  the number of seeds decreased, which is what we expected.
[29:19.930 --> 29:23.170]  It means that less pollen was probably getting
[29:23.170 --> 29:24.690]  to those plots that were further away.
[29:24.690 --> 29:27.170]  They were getting less pollinated.
[29:27.170 --> 29:30.090]  The middle plot there, as the number of seeds
[29:30.090 --> 29:33.970]  on a plant increased, the total potential CBD decreased.
[29:33.970 --> 29:35.370]  Another thing that we expected,
[29:35.370 --> 29:37.610]  as the plants got more pollinated,
[29:37.610 --> 29:39.890]  they had lower levels of cannabinoids.
[29:39.890 --> 29:43.810]  And then the last chart on the left there,
[29:43.810 --> 29:46.330]  as distance from the pollen source increased,
[29:46.330 --> 29:48.530]  the total potential CBD increased.
[29:49.970 --> 29:52.890]  So the plants that were further away got less pollinated
[29:52.890 --> 29:54.690]  at higher cannabinoid levels.
[29:54.690 --> 29:56.930]  You see, we had a little blip at our 1,500 plot
[29:56.930 --> 29:58.530]  because a lot of them were stolen.
[29:58.530 --> 29:59.370]  So,
[29:59.370 --> 30:02.850]  may have affected the line,
[30:02.850 --> 30:04.930]  but you know, general upward trend there.
[30:07.690 --> 30:10.330]  Alrighty, so Jacob and I would be happy
[30:10.330 --> 30:12.450]  to take any questions about any of our trials
[30:12.450 --> 30:13.530]  that we did last year.
[30:13.650 --> 30:14.730]  I'm a speaker.
[30:14.730 --> 30:15.890]  I'm a speaker.
[30:15.890 --> 30:17.810]  At that point, do you take full contact
[30:17.810 --> 30:18.650]  with that plant?
[30:18.650 --> 30:20.170]  Do you get a warning,
[30:20.170 --> 30:21.210]  does that include it?
[30:21.210 --> 30:27.050]  Are you getting any kind of harvesting?
[30:27.050 --> 30:28.810]  Yeah, so we were doing our testing
[30:28.810 --> 30:31.130]  based on the regulatory standard for New York State,
[30:31.130 --> 30:33.050]  which is the top 10 centimeters
[30:33.050 --> 30:36.170]  of a floral tissue on the plant.
[30:36.170 --> 30:38.250]  We dried that in a greenhouse,
[30:38.250 --> 30:41.730]  and then homogenized it in Nutribullet,
[30:41.730 --> 30:43.850]  and then we sent it to the HPLC.
[30:44.850 --> 30:45.690]  Yep.
[30:45.690 --> 30:46.530]  I have a question.
[30:46.530 --> 30:49.770]  What are the potentials of the HPLC machine
[30:49.770 --> 30:58.840]  that I know that they can regularly have
[30:58.840 --> 30:59.880]  their sativa tissue,
[30:59.880 --> 31:01.080]  because they're hybrid.
[31:01.080 --> 31:02.400]  Does that help that then?
[31:02.400 --> 31:04.640]  Does that help the plant?
[31:04.640 --> 31:05.480]  It doesn't actually.
[31:05.480 --> 31:06.640]  I'll repeat the question.
[31:06.640 --> 31:08.280]  Oh, so the question was,
[31:08.280 --> 31:12.600]  does the grouping at all match Indica versus sativa?
[31:13.560 --> 31:17.240]  So, we aren't really concerned
[31:17.240 --> 31:18.920]  in a breeding context or testing
[31:18.960 --> 31:21.320]  about Indica versus sativa.
[31:21.320 --> 31:23.160]  I think the most recent genetic evidence
[31:23.160 --> 31:27.160]  suggests that those aren't truly taxonomically relevant.
[31:27.160 --> 31:28.520]  But the grouping here,
[31:29.760 --> 31:32.120]  it was a lot of within-cultivar variation.
[31:32.120 --> 31:35.120]  Some cultivars did have more heterozygotes than others.
[31:36.360 --> 31:38.240]  But within nearly every cultivar,
[31:38.240 --> 31:39.760]  we had some segregation.
[31:41.920 --> 31:43.360]  I should also make a point here
[31:43.360 --> 31:45.600]  when talking about the total potential,
[31:45.600 --> 31:47.960]  just looking at Delta 9 THC alone,
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.600]  looking at the potential,
[31:49.600 --> 31:52.160]  everything in the blue group was well below.
[31:52.160 --> 31:55.040]  About half of the green group was below.
[31:55.040 --> 31:58.800]  And the marijuana-type reds were always above.
[32:00.000 --> 32:00.840]  Yes?
[32:00.840 --> 32:04.680]  The testing, is it for total THC or just Delta 9?
[32:04.680 --> 32:09.160]  So, we tested for Delta 9, Delta 8, and THCA.
[32:09.160 --> 32:12.040]  And what's on the handout is total potential,
[32:12.040 --> 32:15.880]  which is Delta 9 plus 0.877 times THCA.
[32:15.880 --> 32:17.520]  That's the regulatory standard in New York?
[32:18.080 --> 32:18.920]  It is now, yes.
[32:18.920 --> 32:19.920]  It wasn't last year, but it is now.
[32:22.920 --> 32:24.040]  Did I hear you correctly then,
[32:24.040 --> 32:27.400]  that if you're above 7% THC,
[32:27.400 --> 32:30.160]  then you're over the threshold of THC?
[32:30.160 --> 32:32.720]  That's what we found in last year's study.
[32:32.720 --> 32:36.560]  That's not necessarily the case for every plant.
[32:36.560 --> 32:39.480]  There are some cultivars that we haven't tried.
[32:39.480 --> 32:41.160]  But everything that we've seen
[32:41.160 --> 32:43.880]  has a ratio of around 20 to 25,
[32:43.880 --> 32:45.160]  some go up to 27,
[32:45.160 --> 32:47.440]  but we didn't see much higher of a ratio
[32:48.360 --> 32:49.200]  than last year.
[32:49.200 --> 32:52.200]  What we talked before is 8% THC.
[32:52.200 --> 32:54.040]  So, you can't grow it?
[32:58.040 --> 32:59.400]  I have no comment on that.
[32:59.400 --> 33:00.480]  I mean, yeah.
[33:02.600 --> 33:04.880]  So, the question is,
[33:04.880 --> 33:09.360]  at what point do you request the regulatory sampling?
[33:10.920 --> 33:11.760]  Okay?
[33:11.760 --> 33:13.200]  You have to be compliant at the time
[33:13.200 --> 33:14.560]  of the regulatory sampling.
[33:14.680 --> 33:17.720]  And then you harvest up to three weeks after that.
[33:17.720 --> 33:19.040]  And the levels will accumulate
[33:19.040 --> 33:21.920]  after that regulatory sample is collected.
[33:21.920 --> 33:25.320]  But Jacob is making an excellent point.
[33:25.320 --> 33:29.560]  It is the ratio of CBD to THC that is critical.
[33:29.560 --> 33:33.800]  And we are seeing, at best, a 25 to one ratio.
[33:34.960 --> 33:39.960]  So, if you go for a 12.5% CBD crop,
[33:40.400 --> 33:42.480]  you're at .5% THC,
[33:42.520 --> 33:43.560]  and you're non-compliant.
[33:44.880 --> 33:47.400]  So, my recommendation would be,
[33:47.400 --> 33:49.200]  don't get greedy.
[33:49.200 --> 33:50.120]  Don't get greedy.
[33:51.040 --> 33:52.800]  Test regularly.
[33:52.800 --> 33:55.360]  Ask for the regulatory sample at the proper time,
[33:56.640 --> 33:58.080]  so that you stay compliant.
[33:59.880 --> 34:00.800]  One more question.
[34:02.680 --> 34:07.050]  Do you happen to know,
[34:07.050 --> 34:09.490]  and this might not fall into this research category,
[34:09.490 --> 34:12.410]  but say you went through the whole season.
[34:12.410 --> 34:13.650]  You did it in a month.
[34:13.770 --> 34:14.610]  You did it the whole season.
[34:14.610 --> 34:16.650]  You did everything as per regulation state,
[34:16.650 --> 34:18.970]  and you were just above that threshold
[34:18.970 --> 34:20.450]  at the very end point.
[34:20.450 --> 34:22.410]  So, your crop is a loss at that point.
[34:22.410 --> 34:24.570]  Is there anything in place
[34:24.570 --> 34:26.570]  that could potentially use that crop
[34:26.570 --> 34:29.890]  for fiber or anything otherwise?
[34:29.890 --> 34:32.170]  Or it's just, sorry, we'll see you next year.
[34:33.490 --> 34:34.490]  So, the question is,
[34:34.490 --> 34:37.370]  if you are above the legal regulatory level,
[34:37.370 --> 34:39.130]  is there anything you can do with that crop?
[34:39.130 --> 34:40.450]  And the answer is no.
[34:40.450 --> 34:42.250]  It's gonna be seized and destroyed.
[34:43.090 --> 34:44.290]  All right, thank you.
[34:45.930 --> 34:48.330]  Okay, thanks a lot, Jacob and George.
[34:48.330 --> 34:49.330]  You did a great job.
[34:53.350 --> 34:57.830]  Hi, so I'm gonna be referring to this handout.
[34:57.830 --> 35:00.390]  The title is Evaluating Disease Resistance
[35:00.390 --> 35:02.590]  in Student Health Cultures.
[35:02.590 --> 35:04.670]  So, if you're having trouble finding it,
[35:04.670 --> 35:05.510]  someone has,
[35:06.950 --> 35:08.110]  if you're having trouble finding it,
[35:08.110 --> 35:09.990]  it's the one with a lot of authors,
[35:09.990 --> 35:11.430]  because we had a lot of great people
[35:11.430 --> 35:13.870]  working on this project, besides just me.
[35:13.870 --> 35:18.230]  So, one of the major diseases
[35:18.230 --> 35:22.110]  that we're interested in in hemp is powdery mildew.
[35:22.110 --> 35:25.750]  So, this disease is caused by a fungal pathogen.
[35:25.750 --> 35:28.430]  It shows up as these white spores,
[35:28.430 --> 35:30.390]  these patches on the leaves,
[35:30.390 --> 35:32.230]  which you can see in figure one.
[35:33.510 --> 35:36.390]  And these patches can spread
[35:36.390 --> 35:38.830]  and go on to the flowers
[35:38.830 --> 35:41.830]  and kind of reduce your flower bud quality,
[35:42.830 --> 35:44.750]  which you can see in figure two.
[35:45.950 --> 35:47.230]  And then figure three and four
[35:47.230 --> 35:49.990]  are just zoomed in versions of those spores
[35:50.990 --> 35:53.950]  that are causing this disease.
[35:53.950 --> 35:57.150]  So, right now, there isn't really
[35:59.670 --> 36:02.510]  established disease management for powdery mildew.
[36:02.510 --> 36:03.750]  It's something that we're working on right now.
[36:03.750 --> 36:06.070]  There aren't any approved fungicides,
[36:06.950 --> 36:09.630]  but that's also something we're working on.
[36:09.630 --> 36:11.030]  But another way that we're working on this
[36:11.070 --> 36:13.110]  is looking for resistance.
[36:13.110 --> 36:17.270]  So, we evaluated 30 high CBD cultivars
[36:18.670 --> 36:21.870]  to look for resistance against powdery mildew.
[36:21.870 --> 36:25.550]  So, that is shown at the bottom of the page.
[36:26.430 --> 36:27.870]  So, from these 30 cultivars,
[36:27.870 --> 36:31.030]  we took three leaves from each of the cultivars
[36:31.030 --> 36:35.350]  and inoculated them with the powdery mildew in the lab.
[36:35.350 --> 36:37.630]  And then we rated for disease severity
[36:38.590 --> 36:40.230]  by looking at them under the microscope
[36:40.230 --> 36:41.230]  and counting height.
[36:42.550 --> 36:45.830]  And our results, you can see in the graph in figure five.
[36:45.830 --> 36:48.470]  So, we saw some differences.
[36:48.470 --> 36:50.430]  There are certainly some of the cultivars
[36:50.430 --> 36:52.670]  that are more susceptible to the powdery.
[36:52.670 --> 36:55.150]  And this is something that we're gonna continue to do
[36:55.150 --> 36:57.990]  with more cultivars.
[36:57.990 --> 36:59.310]  Right now, we're doing a screening
[36:59.310 --> 37:01.950]  with grape and fiber cultivars.
[37:01.950 --> 37:04.870]  So, that's something that we're gonna continue to work on.
[37:05.590 --> 37:10.590]  So, that's what we've done so far.
[37:11.550 --> 37:13.110]  And if you turn to the back,
[37:17.070 --> 37:19.470]  we're talking about cross infectivity
[37:19.470 --> 37:22.310]  with hop powdery mildew and hemp powdery mildew.
[37:22.310 --> 37:23.150]  So, you might be thinking,
[37:23.150 --> 37:24.590]  why are we talking about hop powdery mildew?
[37:24.590 --> 37:26.710]  This is hemp, isn't it?
[37:26.710 --> 37:30.230]  Well, hop is actually the most closely related
[37:30.230 --> 37:32.870]  crop species to hemp.
[37:32.870 --> 37:35.070]  And it has its own powdery mildew
[37:35.070 --> 37:37.550]  caused by a completely different genus
[37:37.550 --> 37:39.630]  and species of fungus.
[37:39.630 --> 37:42.510]  And you can see hop leaf infected
[37:42.510 --> 37:44.430]  with powdery mildew in figure six.
[37:44.430 --> 37:48.310]  And figure seven is also a hop,
[37:48.310 --> 37:51.950]  it's a hop flower or cone,
[37:51.950 --> 37:54.390]  and also infected with powdery mildew.
[37:55.310 --> 37:56.910]  So, we were wondering,
[37:56.910 --> 37:58.870]  because these crops are so closely related,
[37:58.870 --> 38:01.830]  can their powdery mildews infect each other?
[38:01.830 --> 38:05.030]  So, is hemp powdery mildew a threat to hop?
[38:05.030 --> 38:07.310]  And in figure eight, you can kind of see
[38:07.310 --> 38:11.590]  that hemp powdery mildew doesn't really grow that great.
[38:15.190 --> 38:18.830]  Hemp powdery mildew does not grow great on hop.
[38:18.830 --> 38:20.910]  So, yes, that's very confusing.
[38:22.110 --> 38:24.790]  So, it doesn't seem like hemp powdery mildew
[38:24.790 --> 38:26.830]  is gonna be that big of a threat to hops.
[38:26.830 --> 38:30.150]  But in figure nine, you can see that hop powdery mildew
[38:30.190 --> 38:35.190]  grows quite well on this particular cultivar of hemp, Inca.
[38:36.150 --> 38:38.870]  So, that is something that we are interested
[38:38.870 --> 38:41.350]  in looking into further.
[38:41.350 --> 38:44.470]  Is there any resistance in hemp
[38:44.470 --> 38:47.070]  to both hemp powdery mildew and hop powdery mildew?
[38:48.310 --> 38:50.870]  Are there any resistant genes?
[38:50.870 --> 38:54.150]  And if so, which cultivars are resistant
[38:54.150 --> 38:57.790]  and how can we incorporate that into the breeding program?
[39:01.150 --> 39:03.150]  I'll take any questions.
[39:08.430 --> 39:10.430]  Oh, the question is, is there anything
[39:10.430 --> 39:12.310]  that can be sprayed for this right now?
[39:12.310 --> 39:14.630]  And the answer is no, there's nothing
[39:14.630 --> 39:18.070]  that is approved right now to be sprayed.
[39:18.070 --> 39:20.150]  That's something that is being worked on.
[39:23.910 --> 39:27.190]  So, I, along with the Department of Ag and Markets,
[39:27.190 --> 39:30.830]  have been working with the New York State DEC.
[39:30.870 --> 39:34.510]  And about two weeks ago, we had a phone call with them
[39:34.510 --> 39:38.390]  and they are working to create a list of products
[39:38.390 --> 39:41.510]  that will be legal to use on hemp.
[39:41.510 --> 39:46.230]  And I asked if that list would be ready this season
[39:46.230 --> 39:49.390]  and the response was, when does this season end?
[39:49.390 --> 39:54.390]  But I have to say, it was a really productive conversation.
[39:54.510 --> 39:56.510]  It was a really productive conversation.
[39:56.510 --> 40:00.870]  The DEC understands the need for both organic
[40:00.870 --> 40:04.030]  and conventional products, the need for products
[40:04.030 --> 40:06.190]  to be used in disease control.
[40:06.190 --> 40:10.430]  And I think they are working on a list of products
[40:10.430 --> 40:12.390]  that will be available for use,
[40:12.390 --> 40:15.070]  hopefully before the end of this season.
[40:15.070 --> 40:16.790]  And not that it's entirely helpful,
[40:16.790 --> 40:18.750]  but certainly by next season.
[40:23.100 --> 40:24.900]  Now you said it's a completely different genus
[40:24.940 --> 40:27.700]  and species that creates it on the hop plant
[40:27.700 --> 40:29.340]  versus the hemp plant.
[40:29.340 --> 40:32.300]  Is there a possibility that it's just because
[40:32.300 --> 40:35.260]  this plant isn't grown out here at all
[40:35.260 --> 40:39.540]  and that this other genus that's usually bad for the hops
[40:39.540 --> 40:42.740]  could potentially, once this crop becomes more mainstream,
[40:42.740 --> 40:45.500]  kind of adapt and become an issue?
[40:45.500 --> 40:47.140]  Since they're so closely related?
[40:52.860 --> 40:54.460]  So, yes.
[40:54.460 --> 40:55.700]  Yes, they should.
[40:55.700 --> 40:57.460]  Short answer is yes.
[40:59.140 --> 41:00.620]  Pathogens are really adaptable.
[41:00.620 --> 41:02.060]  That's what they're good at.
[41:02.060 --> 41:06.820]  And absolutely, if you have a larger target area,
[41:06.820 --> 41:09.500]  and powdery mildew makes millions and millions
[41:09.500 --> 41:12.460]  and millions of spores every year,
[41:12.460 --> 41:14.220]  of course the possibility exists.
[41:15.260 --> 41:19.900]  Right now, we primarily have seen hemp powdery mildew
[41:19.900 --> 41:23.940]  in greenhouse scenarios and not as often in the field.
[41:24.180 --> 41:29.180]  Having said that, if any of you have seen powdery mildew
[41:29.500 --> 41:33.060]  in your hemp field, we would love to have,
[41:33.060 --> 41:36.060]  well, we, Allie would love to have a sample.
[41:36.060 --> 41:41.060]  What we want to do is look at the diversity of this pathogen
[41:42.660 --> 41:45.380]  across New York and across the country
[41:45.380 --> 41:48.820]  to see how similar it is, how diverse it is,
[41:48.820 --> 41:52.860]  and in our search, let me rephrase,
[41:52.860 --> 41:54.700]  in Allie's search for resistance,
[41:56.100 --> 41:57.940]  we want to make sure that if a cultivar
[41:57.940 --> 42:01.180]  is resistant to one strain, we know if it's resistant
[42:01.180 --> 42:04.380]  to all of the strains or if it's strain-specific
[42:04.380 --> 42:05.540]  to the powdery mildew.
[42:17.080 --> 42:20.120]  So, that's something that we're gonna be looking into.
[42:20.120 --> 42:25.120]  So, we haven't collected for CBD yet this year,
[42:26.200 --> 42:29.200]  so that's something that we will be looking into.
[42:30.200 --> 42:32.680]  Just, these are plants that are being,
[42:32.680 --> 42:35.160]  that you'll see, that are being grown in the field right now.
[42:35.160 --> 42:38.060]  Yeah, so we haven't harvested them yet, so.
[42:39.080 --> 42:39.920]  Next year.
[42:39.920 --> 42:41.960]  Maybe we'll have that information.
[42:41.960 --> 42:42.800]  Yeah.
[42:44.120 --> 42:49.980]  What's your turnaround times?
[42:49.980 --> 42:53.900]  That might be a question for our reader, guys.
[42:53.900 --> 42:55.580]  Yeah.
[42:55.580 --> 42:58.060]  It's been my experience that a plant reader
[42:58.060 --> 42:59.620]  always tells you five years.
[42:59.620 --> 43:00.780]  Okay.
[43:00.780 --> 43:01.980]  Larry, five years?
[43:02.980 --> 43:04.300]  Yeah, five years.
[43:04.300 --> 43:05.140]  Yeah.
[43:06.900 --> 43:08.020]  Three to five years.
[43:08.020 --> 43:08.860]  Yeah.
[43:11.340 --> 43:15.580]  So, it depends on the genetic mechanisms of resistance.
[43:15.580 --> 43:20.580]  So, we have two, broadly, two mechanisms of resistance.
[43:21.020 --> 43:23.940]  If it's a single gene that's conferring resistance,
[43:23.940 --> 43:26.500]  that single gene can be fairly easy to incorporate
[43:26.500 --> 43:28.500]  into a leaf cultivars.
[43:28.500 --> 43:31.420]  If it's a multigenic mechanism,
[43:31.420 --> 43:34.980]  that can be very challenging, a very long-term process,
[43:34.980 --> 43:37.540]  but that mechanism is more stable
[43:37.540 --> 43:39.740]  in its long-term resistance.
[43:39.740 --> 43:41.340]  But we have three to five years.
[43:43.140 --> 43:45.220]  One other thing I should mention that Allie is doing
[43:45.220 --> 43:46.700]  that she didn't bring up is,
[43:47.740 --> 43:51.220]  we are, here on Researchland,
[43:51.220 --> 43:56.220]  testing different products and spraying them on plants
[43:56.820 --> 43:59.780]  that may be approved for use in the future
[43:59.820 --> 44:01.620]  to see if there's phytotoxicity,
[44:01.620 --> 44:04.940]  but also to see if any of the products
[44:04.940 --> 44:07.860]  that may be approved cause modifications
[44:07.860 --> 44:10.420]  in THC or CBD levels,
[44:10.420 --> 44:13.300]  because, really, nothing is known about,
[44:13.300 --> 44:15.060]  even if you use an organic product,
[44:15.060 --> 44:17.100]  which frequently are living bacteria
[44:17.100 --> 44:20.580]  that secrete antibiotics that kill powdery mildew,
[44:20.580 --> 44:22.500]  we don't know what that does to THC
[44:22.500 --> 44:24.220]  or CBD concentration in the flowers.
[44:24.220 --> 44:25.460]  So, that's one of the important things
[44:25.460 --> 44:27.380]  that Allie will be looking at as well.
[44:30.100 --> 44:32.260]  Are you seeing any evidence
[44:32.260 --> 44:34.500]  or tracking mites at this point?
[44:35.420 --> 44:37.460]  The question is, are we tracking mites?
[44:37.460 --> 44:41.340]  And we do see mites in the field, for sure.
[44:41.340 --> 44:42.980]  They're probably, I'm not sure,
[44:42.980 --> 44:45.980]  there are people that are testing.
[44:45.980 --> 44:47.580]  At least from what I've seen,
[44:47.580 --> 44:50.180]  I have not seen cold-heart differentiation.
[45:01.170 --> 45:03.250]  We have on our schedule today, Dennis Willett,
[45:03.250 --> 45:05.210]  who is a new assistant professor
[45:05.210 --> 45:07.730]  in the Department of Entomology here at Cornell Agrotech.
[45:07.770 --> 45:10.290]  Unfortunately, he fell ill this morning
[45:10.290 --> 45:12.050]  and is in the hospital.
[45:13.210 --> 45:17.010]  So, Camelia Gilgares, in his lab,
[45:17.010 --> 45:19.930]  we're handing out her handout right now,
[45:19.930 --> 45:23.490]  and we'll talk about the work in Dennis' lab
[45:23.490 --> 45:28.490]  to characterize secondary products and terpenes.
[45:28.650 --> 45:29.490]  Camelia.
[45:30.370 --> 45:31.210]  Thank you.
[45:32.250 --> 45:39.220]  Thank you for the opportunity, Paul.
[45:39.220 --> 45:40.300]  I'm Camelia.
[45:40.340 --> 45:43.460]  I'm working in the ASAP lab.
[45:43.460 --> 45:47.340]  We basically work with chemical ecology in different ways.
[45:48.260 --> 45:51.540]  So, talking more about this,
[45:51.540 --> 45:54.380]  we're working, trying to understand
[45:54.380 --> 45:59.380]  how plants and insects can communicate using chemicals.
[46:00.100 --> 46:04.900]  And why I'm here, because those chemicals,
[46:04.900 --> 46:08.380]  including terpenes, are very important
[46:08.380 --> 46:11.420]  for understanding those communications.
[46:11.420 --> 46:13.460]  Why terpenes?
[46:13.460 --> 46:15.780]  Terpenes are small molecules,
[46:15.780 --> 46:18.780]  and they are important for two reasons.
[46:18.780 --> 46:22.860]  The first reason is for plant defense.
[46:22.860 --> 46:25.620]  They are very important to understand,
[46:25.620 --> 46:28.940]  and the plants can defend against insects
[46:28.940 --> 46:32.260]  or pathogens or stress.
[46:32.260 --> 46:35.260]  And the other thing that is very important,
[46:35.260 --> 46:38.220]  and the terpenes influence a lot of plants,
[46:39.060 --> 46:43.620]  including hemp, is the smell and taste.
[46:43.620 --> 46:48.620]  So, in our lab, we try to quantify and identify
[46:48.780 --> 46:51.060]  the compounds and the terpenes,
[46:51.060 --> 46:53.780]  how much we have in the plants,
[46:53.780 --> 46:58.780]  and how those amounts, or how the mix with compounds
[46:59.340 --> 47:01.620]  can influence the response.
[47:02.820 --> 47:06.660]  Now we are doing some work with Prismart and Larismart,
[47:06.660 --> 47:09.900]  where we are trying to understand
[47:09.900 --> 47:14.780]  which terpenes are involved for the hemp,
[47:15.860 --> 47:18.340]  for the taste and the smell of the hemp,
[47:18.340 --> 47:21.300]  because it's something very important,
[47:21.300 --> 47:24.220]  and how this can influence the pathogens
[47:24.220 --> 47:29.220]  and the plants that can, with insects and stress.
[47:29.220 --> 47:32.180]  For to do this, we just collect some plant samples,
[47:32.180 --> 47:33.460]  can be the whole plant,
[47:33.460 --> 47:36.060]  or we just collect air around the plant.
[47:36.780 --> 47:39.380]  And bring those samples to the lab.
[47:39.380 --> 47:44.380]  We have the mass spectra, or the chromatography,
[47:45.100 --> 47:46.900]  when we analyze those chemicals,
[47:46.900 --> 47:50.540]  and we can quantify and identify all those compounds.
[47:51.460 --> 47:54.140]  With this, we can test those compounds,
[47:54.140 --> 47:59.140]  and we can see exactly which one has influenced
[47:59.140 --> 48:04.140]  the results or the preference or the defense.
[48:04.980 --> 48:09.980]  Basically, the idea with our work with the hemp,
[48:09.980 --> 48:11.820]  just started with this,
[48:11.820 --> 48:16.820]  and test the importance of those terpenes on the plant.
[48:18.340 --> 48:22.500]  On the back here, we have some examples with terpenes
[48:22.500 --> 48:25.300]  that we can find at the hemp plant.
[48:26.220 --> 48:30.140]  And I bring some vials with different kind of terpenes,
[48:30.140 --> 48:34.820]  if you guys are interested to smell and see the difference.
[48:34.820 --> 48:38.300]  I don't think you guys will smell exactly the same smell
[48:38.300 --> 48:41.060]  for the ramp, because normally it's a combination
[48:41.060 --> 48:43.460]  with different compounds.
[48:43.460 --> 48:47.020]  So, if you guys are interested, I can show you guys.
[48:50.380 --> 48:51.220]  Thank you.
[48:52.140 --> 49:00.900]  What's your favorite way to identify the plants?
[49:01.940 --> 49:05.500]  We can identify different numbers of terpenes.
[49:06.420 --> 49:10.500]  Most of the times when we take the sample from the plants,
[49:10.500 --> 49:12.460]  we have no idea.
[49:12.460 --> 49:16.060]  We are trying to figure out the terpenes that we can find.
[49:16.060 --> 49:19.580]  And with this, we can synthesize those terpenes,
[49:19.580 --> 49:24.140]  and test those terpenes against whatever we want to test,
[49:24.140 --> 49:25.580]  or smell or taste.
[49:28.460 --> 49:31.460]  The hemp, we have at this list on the back,
[49:31.460 --> 49:34.900]  have some terpenes that we can find at the hemp plants.
[49:35.900 --> 49:39.380]  But, we are working with some species now,
[49:39.380 --> 49:42.900]  but we don't have exactly the terpenes.
[49:43.940 --> 49:44.940]  Specific ones.
[49:48.140 --> 49:51.660]  Is the thought that you'll identify the terpenes
[49:51.660 --> 49:54.420]  that repel specific insects,
[49:54.420 --> 49:59.420]  and then genetically create a seed that's a plant
[49:59.820 --> 50:01.980]  that can descend naturally?
[50:01.980 --> 50:04.940]  Yeah, our goal is trying to identify some terpenes
[50:05.380 --> 50:09.420]  that can be useful for the pest control, yes.
[50:09.420 --> 50:12.540]  Normally it's not just one, it's a combination.
[50:12.540 --> 50:17.380]  And we have different ways that we can apply
[50:17.380 --> 50:18.660]  those terpenes on the plants.
[50:18.660 --> 50:22.180]  Can be a genetic thing, or it can be just directly sprayed
[50:22.180 --> 50:24.860]  on the plants, and this plant can synthesize,
[50:24.860 --> 50:28.060]  or you can stimulate the plants to produce those terpenes.
[50:29.020 --> 50:32.100]  So you're thinking, synthetic?
[50:32.100 --> 50:35.460]  Yeah, no, our idea is just to identify first,
[50:35.460 --> 50:39.340]  and after that, try to stimulate the plants to do something.
[50:39.340 --> 50:42.140]  And we can use the genetic things to do,
[50:42.140 --> 50:44.660]  or we can use the different ways.
[50:55.480 --> 50:56.320]  Good question.
[50:58.760 --> 50:59.960]  I'm not sure.
[51:03.680 --> 51:05.760]  I mean, we'll find that out during the course of study.
[51:05.760 --> 51:08.560]  Yeah, I don't want to, yeah.
[51:08.560 --> 51:09.720]  What was the question?
[51:11.120 --> 51:13.480]  So the question is, are there correlations
[51:13.480 --> 51:18.160]  between particular terpenes and particular cannabinoids?
[51:18.160 --> 51:20.960]  And there was a very nice paper done at Washington State.
[51:20.960 --> 51:22.680]  It was just published a couple months ago
[51:22.680 --> 51:24.160]  to characterize that.
[51:24.160 --> 51:26.760]  And if I'm trying to remember,
[51:26.760 --> 51:28.600]  Jacob might remember better than I.
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.080]  I do not recall that they saw specific correlations
[51:33.080 --> 51:36.600]  between particular terpenes and particular cannabinoids.
[51:37.600 --> 51:39.200]  Those were marijuana types.
[51:41.480 --> 51:45.040]  It's why we are testing different species, too.
[51:45.040 --> 51:47.400]  We want to understand better.
[51:59.450 --> 52:03.610]  I don't think we have something that we do,
[52:03.610 --> 52:06.490]  we don't do anything with this yet.
[52:06.490 --> 52:08.610]  We are just working with the basic things
[52:08.610 --> 52:11.450]  and try to identify the terpenes.
[52:11.450 --> 52:14.410]  But I'm sure we'll be there, some next step.
[52:14.410 --> 52:15.250]  Yeah.
[52:20.700 --> 52:22.220]  Thanks very much, Pamela.
[52:22.220 --> 52:23.060]  Thank you.
[52:23.060 --> 52:23.900]  Thank you.
[52:23.900 --> 52:24.740]  Thank you.
[52:24.740 --> 52:25.580]  Thank you.
