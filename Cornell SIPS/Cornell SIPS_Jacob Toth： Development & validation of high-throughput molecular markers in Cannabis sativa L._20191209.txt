[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.940 --> 00:08.780]  Thank you very much.
[00:08.780 --> 00:12.380]  Before I start, I'd like to thank New York Ag and Markets
[00:12.380 --> 00:14.460]  through the Empire State Development Corporation
[00:14.460 --> 00:15.780]  who funded most of this work.
[00:15.780 --> 00:18.380]  I'd also like to thank the technician team
[00:18.380 --> 00:21.060]  at the SMART Lab at Cornell Agrotech in Geneva
[00:21.060 --> 00:25.180]  and also the Rose and Vyons Lab
[00:25.180 --> 00:27.220]  for their help, especially with the HPLC.
[00:28.780 --> 00:31.340]  So let's talk about cannabis.
[00:31.380 --> 00:33.940]  The best scientific research today
[00:33.940 --> 00:36.100]  suggests that there's a single species of cannabis,
[00:36.100 --> 00:38.100]  cannabis sativa.
[00:38.100 --> 00:41.620]  It's distinguished legally into hemp and marijuana.
[00:41.620 --> 00:44.580]  Hemp is less than 0.3% THC,
[00:44.580 --> 00:47.100]  THC being the psychoactive chemical
[00:47.100 --> 00:48.300]  that you find in marijuana,
[00:48.300 --> 00:51.980]  and marijuana being above 0.3% THC.
[00:51.980 --> 00:54.020]  And this is simply the legal definition
[00:54.020 --> 00:56.340]  and it's very important as I'll discuss later.
[00:56.340 --> 00:58.140]  So a little bit about the biology of cannabis.
[00:58.140 --> 01:00.060]  It's diploid, it's dioecious,
[01:00.060 --> 01:02.180]  meaning it has male and female plants.
[01:02.180 --> 01:04.620]  The male plants have an X and a Y chromosome,
[01:04.620 --> 01:07.180]  the female plants have two X chromosomes.
[01:07.180 --> 01:09.980]  There are also some plants that are monoecious,
[01:09.980 --> 01:12.940]  having male and female flowers on the same plant,
[01:12.940 --> 01:16.060]  and these have two X chromosomes like the female.
[01:16.060 --> 01:19.020]  So cannabis can be grown for a wide variety of things.
[01:19.020 --> 01:20.420]  It's mainly grown for grain,
[01:20.420 --> 01:22.020]  which can be pressed into a nice oil
[01:22.020 --> 01:24.260]  and a nice protein-rich fragment,
[01:24.260 --> 01:27.020]  the fiber, and also the inflorescences.
[01:27.020 --> 01:29.020]  So in the inflorescences,
[01:29.020 --> 01:32.020]  particularly the unpollinated female inflorescences,
[01:32.020 --> 01:34.500]  you can get a high density of trichomes,
[01:34.500 --> 01:38.140]  and these trichomes produce very interesting chemicals,
[01:38.140 --> 01:41.380]  notably cannabinoids like THC and CBD,
[01:41.380 --> 01:42.420]  as well as terpenes,
[01:42.420 --> 01:45.420]  which give cannabis its distinct smell.
[01:45.420 --> 01:49.380]  So the major hemp market with less than 0.3% THC
[01:49.380 --> 01:51.060]  is currently CBD.
[01:52.220 --> 01:53.460]  So there are a few different factors
[01:53.460 --> 01:56.100]  which could potentially affect CBD production.
[01:56.100 --> 01:57.700]  Female versus male, as I mentioned,
[01:57.700 --> 02:00.620]  you want a plot entirely consisting
[02:00.620 --> 02:02.940]  of unpollinated female inflorescences,
[02:02.940 --> 02:05.180]  so you have to get rid of the males.
[02:05.180 --> 02:08.940]  The genetic control over CBD or THC is very interesting,
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.140]  and I'll discuss that later.
[02:10.140 --> 02:11.300]  And you can also imagine
[02:11.300 --> 02:13.020]  that there would be environmental effects
[02:13.020 --> 02:15.780]  affecting these traits.
[02:15.780 --> 02:17.140]  So first off, I'm gonna be talking
[02:17.140 --> 02:19.300]  about female versus male plants.
[02:19.300 --> 02:20.340]  So there are a few different ways
[02:20.340 --> 02:22.220]  to get a field full of females.
[02:22.220 --> 02:23.780]  You can grow from clones.
[02:23.780 --> 02:27.340]  You can do a little bit of hormonal trickery
[02:27.340 --> 02:32.060]  and create a seed lot that consists only of XX females.
[02:32.060 --> 02:34.380]  Unfortunately, those seeds are quite expensive.
[02:34.380 --> 02:36.100]  It's not uncommon to see those for sale
[02:36.100 --> 02:38.020]  at over $2 a seed.
[02:38.020 --> 02:41.100]  Or you can plant a regular dioecious male
[02:41.100 --> 02:45.020]  and female seed lot and somehow get rid of the males.
[02:45.020 --> 02:46.980]  So perhaps the most straightforward way to do that
[02:46.980 --> 02:49.660]  is to just do it phenotypically.
[02:49.660 --> 02:52.380]  When you see a male plant, take it out.
[02:52.380 --> 02:53.740]  That's not so bad,
[02:53.740 --> 02:55.380]  but if you're growing many, many acres,
[02:55.380 --> 02:56.340]  that can get very tiring
[02:56.340 --> 02:58.420]  because it's about a 50-50 ratio.
[02:58.420 --> 03:00.540]  And by the time you see a male plant,
[03:00.540 --> 03:02.700]  you're probably gonna get some pollen formation
[03:02.700 --> 03:05.700]  and that can reduce yields significantly.
[03:05.700 --> 03:07.780]  So one of the things that I did here
[03:07.780 --> 03:10.700]  that I'll be talking about is development of a marker
[03:10.700 --> 03:13.180]  that can distinguish the males from the females.
[03:13.180 --> 03:15.940]  So there are previously published markers.
[03:15.940 --> 03:17.700]  They're mostly based on sequences
[03:17.700 --> 03:19.300]  specific to the Y chromosome.
[03:20.540 --> 03:22.060]  Six published sequence are called
[03:22.060 --> 03:25.180]  male-associated DNA of cannabis, one through six.
[03:25.540 --> 03:27.580]  Unfortunately, in their publications,
[03:27.580 --> 03:29.580]  they weren't tested on diverse germ plasms,
[03:29.580 --> 03:31.500]  so it's kind of hard to rule out
[03:31.500 --> 03:33.140]  that it was just due to chance.
[03:33.140 --> 03:34.340]  And they're also lower throughput
[03:34.340 --> 03:36.900]  being gel or electrophoresis-based.
[03:36.900 --> 03:39.460]  What I wanted to do was create an assay
[03:39.460 --> 03:43.020]  that I could go and screen thousands of plants
[03:43.020 --> 03:44.220]  at my leisure.
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.580]  And to do that, I developed a PACE assay,
[03:46.580 --> 03:48.300]  which is fluorescently based.
[03:48.300 --> 03:51.660]  So with this fluorescently based assay,
[03:51.660 --> 03:53.260]  I can just look to see,
[03:53.260 --> 03:57.020]  is there fluorescence of a certain color in my assay?
[03:57.020 --> 03:59.980]  And if so, it's a male, discard the plant.
[03:59.980 --> 04:02.460]  So I did this using the MAD-C6
[04:02.460 --> 04:06.940]  by aligning it to published XX genomes
[04:06.940 --> 04:07.860]  that have been assembled.
[04:07.860 --> 04:09.780]  Unfortunately, there's still no published
[04:09.780 --> 04:11.900]  Y-assembled chromosome,
[04:11.900 --> 04:13.980]  so we don't have all of the data there,
[04:13.980 --> 04:16.100]  which would make this a lot easier.
[04:16.100 --> 04:18.620]  So testing it on an initial panel,
[04:18.620 --> 04:20.140]  I found that there was separation
[04:20.140 --> 04:22.660]  between the males and the females.
[04:22.660 --> 04:25.940]  I then tested it over several different cultivars.
[04:25.940 --> 04:27.660]  These are all unrelated,
[04:27.660 --> 04:29.180]  different numbers of males and females.
[04:29.180 --> 04:31.300]  And in every case, I found that this marker
[04:31.300 --> 04:33.820]  that I developed was 100% accurate.
[04:34.740 --> 04:39.060]  So then came the real acid test of this marker.
[04:39.060 --> 04:42.140]  For our 2019 CBD variety trials,
[04:42.140 --> 04:44.700]  we had 13 different dioecious cultivars
[04:44.700 --> 04:47.420]  that we wanted to only plant the females out.
[04:47.420 --> 04:50.860]  So we screened several thousand plants.
[04:50.860 --> 04:55.380]  We found a 50-50 segregation based on the separation,
[04:55.380 --> 04:57.420]  as you can see here in part B.
[04:58.420 --> 04:59.460]  So that was very promising
[04:59.460 --> 05:00.540]  because that's what we were expecting.
[05:00.540 --> 05:04.780]  There's no cultivars where it wasn't the case except for one.
[05:05.740 --> 05:08.140]  We planted out just the female plants,
[05:08.140 --> 05:12.020]  and thankfully we found that approximately 98%
[05:12.020 --> 05:14.180]  of the female plants that we thought were female
[05:14.180 --> 05:15.820]  tended to be female.
[05:15.820 --> 05:17.940]  An additional 1% were monoecious,
[05:17.940 --> 05:19.380]  which is what we were expecting
[05:19.380 --> 05:22.660]  because as I mentioned before,
[05:22.660 --> 05:24.340]  monoecious plants are XX,
[05:24.340 --> 05:25.500]  and there's some other factor
[05:25.500 --> 05:27.100]  which caused them to be monoecious.
[05:27.100 --> 05:29.740]  And then the remaining 1% of the ones that I tested,
[05:29.740 --> 05:32.500]  it seems like it was at least mostly original miscalls.
[05:32.500 --> 05:34.060]  And I tested the same plant again,
[05:34.060 --> 05:35.140]  it showed up as a male.
[05:35.140 --> 05:39.220]  So it looks like there is a diagnostic sex-linked marker here.
[05:40.180 --> 05:41.660]  So that's what we've been doing
[05:41.660 --> 05:43.820]  to distinguish the males from the females.
[05:43.820 --> 05:45.060]  So the next thing that I'm gonna talk about
[05:45.060 --> 05:47.260]  is CBD versus THC.
[05:47.260 --> 05:49.460]  Before I go on, I just wanted to point out
[05:49.460 --> 05:52.140]  all of this magic happens in this trichome
[05:52.140 --> 05:53.300]  that you can see here,
[05:53.300 --> 05:55.140]  particularly it happens in that head.
[05:56.460 --> 05:57.940]  So what's really interesting about the CBD
[05:57.940 --> 06:00.820]  versus THC genetically is that
[06:00.820 --> 06:03.340]  it's pretty much a single locus.
[06:03.340 --> 06:04.780]  It's called the B locus.
[06:04.780 --> 06:08.500]  When it produces mainly THC, it's called the BT locus.
[06:08.500 --> 06:12.300]  When it produces mainly CBD, it's the BD locus.
[06:13.580 --> 06:16.300]  So very recently, there have been several published genomes
[06:16.380 --> 06:18.820]  that have found that it's not a single gene,
[06:18.820 --> 06:22.540]  it's two genes, close-linked and repulsion,
[06:22.540 --> 06:26.860]  but it can be modeled monogenically
[06:26.860 --> 06:31.100]  and can be modeled monogenetically very well.
[06:32.020 --> 06:35.180]  So just to go through briefly how it works,
[06:35.180 --> 06:38.180]  in that trichome head, you start off with the CBGA,
[06:38.180 --> 06:39.900]  which is the precursor.
[06:39.900 --> 06:44.500]  If you have two BD alleles, which is the CBDA,
[06:44.500 --> 06:46.500]  you get conversion into CBDA.
[06:46.500 --> 06:51.460]  If you have two BT alleles, that's the THCA, you get THCA.
[06:51.460 --> 06:53.620]  When you have a heterozygous case,
[06:53.620 --> 06:55.420]  you get one allele of each,
[06:55.420 --> 06:59.460]  and you get roughly equal amounts of CBDA and THCA.
[06:59.460 --> 07:02.900]  What's very interesting is that the CBD and THC,
[07:02.900 --> 07:04.900]  which are the actual active compounds
[07:04.900 --> 07:07.180]  that people are growing this plant for,
[07:07.180 --> 07:09.140]  it's not actually produced in the plant itself.
[07:09.140 --> 07:12.180]  It's only after you get decarboxylation,
[07:12.180 --> 07:14.940]  and that can be done through heat or light
[07:14.940 --> 07:16.900]  or simply through age.
[07:16.900 --> 07:20.620]  So to go back to that 0.3%,
[07:20.620 --> 07:23.580]  that's not actually the amount of THC in the plant.
[07:23.580 --> 07:27.740]  That's the amount of THC if all of the THCA
[07:27.740 --> 07:31.580]  were decarboxylated and converted to THC.
[07:31.580 --> 07:35.100]  So given that it's a single locus,
[07:35.100 --> 07:37.500]  people have developed diagnostic markers before,
[07:37.500 --> 07:39.060]  especially University of Minnesota
[07:39.060 --> 07:41.500]  has done some excellent work in this area.
[07:41.540 --> 07:44.340]  But again, their markers, like the sex-linked ones,
[07:44.340 --> 07:46.380]  were gel or electrophoresis-based
[07:46.380 --> 07:48.420]  and therefore fairly low throughput.
[07:48.420 --> 07:49.820]  So using their markers,
[07:49.820 --> 07:53.100]  I developed another PACE assay that was high throughput
[07:53.100 --> 07:56.340]  and tested it on some samples that we were growing in 2018
[07:56.340 --> 07:59.100]  for the CBD variety trial.
[07:59.100 --> 08:01.460]  Now very surprisingly, I found that nearly a third
[08:01.460 --> 08:05.020]  of the plants by this marker were heterozygous,
[08:05.020 --> 08:07.020]  meaning that they produced roughly equal amounts
[08:07.020 --> 08:08.820]  of CBD and THC.
[08:08.820 --> 08:10.100]  And again, this is a single locus,
[08:10.100 --> 08:11.980]  so it seems like it would be a pretty easy thing
[08:11.980 --> 08:12.820]  to breed for.
[08:12.820 --> 08:14.460]  So we were quite surprised to see
[08:14.460 --> 08:17.620]  that across nearly every cultivar we tested,
[08:17.620 --> 08:22.620]  there is active THCA synthase genes producing THC
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.780]  in these CBD varieties.
[08:24.780 --> 08:26.020]  So this was really surprising.
[08:26.020 --> 08:27.660]  And this is just the molecular data here.
[08:27.660 --> 08:30.260]  And as you can see, it varies by cultivar,
[08:31.340 --> 08:33.580]  percent of the BT allele.
[08:33.580 --> 08:37.180]  So does this match what we saw with the HPLC?
[08:38.180 --> 08:39.500]  Turns out that it does.
[08:39.900 --> 08:41.900]  Turns out that some of the CBD varieties that we were
[08:41.900 --> 08:45.180]  growing had individuals that produced no CBD,
[08:45.180 --> 08:47.380]  but high levels of THC.
[08:47.380 --> 08:48.540]  About a third of the plants,
[08:48.540 --> 08:51.620]  or nearly a third of the plants produced about equal amounts
[08:51.620 --> 08:54.060]  of CBD and THC.
[08:54.060 --> 08:56.140]  And then the rest were mostly CBD,
[08:56.140 --> 08:58.900]  which is what we were expecting them all to be.
[08:58.900 --> 09:01.860]  So we have a high throughput marker now,
[09:01.860 --> 09:03.100]  simple genetic control.
[09:03.100 --> 09:04.660]  It should be easy to keep all of our plants
[09:04.660 --> 09:07.180]  under 0.3%, right?
[09:07.180 --> 09:08.940]  Unfortunately, that's not the case.
[09:09.340 --> 09:10.500]  You can see this red line here,
[09:10.500 --> 09:13.140]  that's 0.3% total potential.
[09:13.140 --> 09:16.220]  So that's what happens if you take all of the THCA,
[09:16.220 --> 09:17.620]  convert it to THC.
[09:17.620 --> 09:19.260]  And as you can see this blue group here,
[09:19.260 --> 09:22.620]  which is the mostly CBD group, that's BBDD.
[09:24.180 --> 09:27.100]  The line formed by the blue dots there,
[09:27.100 --> 09:30.340]  crosses at around 6%.
[09:30.340 --> 09:34.740]  Now, there was a study out of Germany published in 2018,
[09:34.740 --> 09:38.700]  that found that isolated CBDA synthase produces CBD
[09:39.260 --> 09:43.260]  and THC at a ratio of about 20 to one.
[09:43.260 --> 09:47.300]  So if that in vitro were exactly the same in vivo,
[09:47.300 --> 09:48.620]  which is a big jump,
[09:48.620 --> 09:53.620]  you would expect to see that 0.3 times 20, 6%.
[09:54.820 --> 09:57.500]  So there you see it crossed around 6%.
[09:57.500 --> 10:00.180]  So it looks like the in vitro work matches
[10:00.180 --> 10:02.220]  the in vivo work fairly well.
[10:02.220 --> 10:04.740]  Just to get a close up here.
[10:04.740 --> 10:06.420]  So this is not the 2018 data,
[10:06.420 --> 10:09.780]  but rather the BBDD group of the 2019 data
[10:09.780 --> 10:11.780]  that we're still working to process.
[10:11.780 --> 10:16.780]  And you can see 0.3 crosses this line between six and 7%.
[10:17.580 --> 10:21.180]  So this means that if you're growing hemp for CBD,
[10:21.180 --> 10:23.100]  and it gets above 7%,
[10:23.100 --> 10:25.900]  chances are it's going to be hot for THC.
[10:25.900 --> 10:30.180]  And that's a serious problem because most farmers,
[10:30.180 --> 10:32.420]  their lower bound is around 10%.
[10:32.420 --> 10:35.580]  So this is gonna be a serious problem coming up.
[10:35.580 --> 10:38.020]  So I guess I should take a step back.
[10:38.020 --> 10:40.060]  In the 2018 Farm Bill,
[10:40.060 --> 10:43.580]  what changed was instead of just looking at the THC,
[10:43.580 --> 10:46.220]  they're looking at total potential THC.
[10:46.220 --> 10:48.900]  So last year, it's okay.
[10:48.900 --> 10:51.700]  A lot of people passed unless they were growing
[10:51.700 --> 10:54.900]  anything in the red or the green.
[10:54.900 --> 10:56.300]  But in future years,
[10:56.300 --> 10:59.780]  if we're gonna stay with 0.3 total potential,
[10:59.780 --> 11:02.220]  that's going to be a big problem.
[11:02.220 --> 11:03.580]  The last thing that we were considering
[11:03.580 --> 11:05.340]  was maybe there's an environmental effect.
[11:06.100 --> 11:07.500]  Can we fix that ratio?
[11:07.500 --> 11:08.500]  I didn't mention this before,
[11:08.500 --> 11:10.140]  but in the 2018 trials,
[11:10.140 --> 11:13.780]  we had it replicated in Ithaca and in Geneva.
[11:13.780 --> 11:15.620]  So in model four there,
[11:15.620 --> 11:18.420]  that's including the trial as a factor
[11:18.420 --> 11:20.300]  in the CBD to THC ratio,
[11:20.300 --> 11:23.220]  and we saw no statistically significant effect.
[11:23.220 --> 11:26.100]  So it looks like it's almost entirely genetic.
[11:26.100 --> 11:28.620]  What is kind of interesting is that
[11:28.620 --> 11:33.380]  if you look at models two or six that include the marker,
[11:33.380 --> 11:34.860]  that doesn't actually appear to affect
[11:34.860 --> 11:36.940]  the total potential cannabinoids.
[11:36.940 --> 11:38.420]  But if you look at any of the models,
[11:38.420 --> 11:40.380]  including the cultivar, it does.
[11:40.380 --> 11:44.140]  So this CBD to THC ratio, this marker,
[11:44.140 --> 11:46.940]  doesn't appear to affect total potential cannabinoids,
[11:46.940 --> 11:50.180]  but explains CBD to THC almost entirely.
[11:51.380 --> 11:53.980]  So in conclusion, we developed high throughput
[11:53.980 --> 11:56.580]  sexy cannabinoid type markers,
[11:56.580 --> 11:58.260]  developed them and validated them.
[11:58.260 --> 12:01.620]  We found that modern CBD hemp cultivar populations
[12:01.620 --> 12:04.220]  are segregating for cannabinoid type.
[12:04.220 --> 12:06.740]  We found very importantly that even in the best case,
[12:06.740 --> 12:10.540]  BDBD homozygous hemp type or CBD type
[12:10.540 --> 12:14.980]  produces 0.3% THC at around 7% CBD,
[12:14.980 --> 12:17.580]  and neither cultivar per se nor trial
[12:17.580 --> 12:20.980]  really affected the CBD to THC ratio.
[12:20.980 --> 12:29.900]  And with that, I'd be happy to take any questions.
[12:30.740 --> 12:35.140]  My question is, is hemp cultivars open pollinated?
[12:35.140 --> 12:38.180]  If so, how do you explain the fact that it's only
[12:38.180 --> 12:40.420]  being used for the purpose of pollination?
[12:40.420 --> 12:44.860]  So I guess, given that potential, how is it being used?
[12:44.860 --> 12:47.900]  Yeah, so the question is, so are the,
[12:47.900 --> 12:51.140]  first of all, are the cultivars open pollinated?
[12:51.140 --> 12:52.620]  And is it a dilucious crop?
[12:52.620 --> 12:55.780]  So I guess it really depends on the skill of the breeder.
[12:55.780 --> 12:59.580]  If they kept the marijuana plants, the BT plants,
[12:59.580 --> 13:01.980]  away from the BD plants and scaled it up well,
[13:01.980 --> 13:03.780]  that shouldn't be an issue.
[13:03.780 --> 13:07.820]  I think that the problem is the breeding wasn't great.
[13:07.820 --> 13:11.740]  So I think their pollen control wasn't effective,
[13:11.740 --> 13:13.340]  which is why you're getting introgression
[13:13.340 --> 13:14.620]  of these BT alleles.
[13:16.860 --> 13:19.860]  Has anybody just like put chalcone synthase
[13:19.860 --> 13:23.340]  on the Y chromosome and then you just have a red plant?
[13:23.340 --> 13:26.420]  We're actively working towards that, or sorry.
[13:26.420 --> 13:29.220]  Is there a better way to distinguish males from females?
[13:30.220 --> 13:31.060]  I wish.
[13:31.060 --> 13:33.820]  We are working towards that.
[13:33.820 --> 13:37.860]  At the moment, nobody has convincingly transformed cannabis.
[13:38.780 --> 13:40.180]  So at some point, it would be great
[13:40.180 --> 13:44.180]  if we could make male plants red, but we're not there yet.
[13:46.540 --> 13:49.820]  Has there been any research into curing methods?
[13:49.820 --> 13:52.260]  So maybe you have these high CBD lines.
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.700]  Is there a way that you can cure it
[13:53.700 --> 13:55.700]  a little bit differently so you're not getting
[13:55.700 --> 13:57.940]  that THC activated or?
[13:58.100 --> 14:01.100]  To cure the plant differently so you don't get a high THC?
[14:01.100 --> 14:05.940]  So the ratio of THCA to THC mattered last year,
[14:05.940 --> 14:08.100]  but this year it doesn't matter at all.
[14:08.100 --> 14:10.540]  So the actual plant is the thing that's producing
[14:10.540 --> 14:13.620]  the CBD or A or the THCA.
[14:13.620 --> 14:18.620]  And then once the plant is harvested, it's pretty much set.
[14:18.700 --> 14:22.860]  But there's conversion of THCA to THC after that.
[14:22.860 --> 14:25.260]  And there could be potentially methods of drying
[14:25.260 --> 14:27.300]  that would change that ratio.
[14:27.660 --> 14:31.780]  But with the 2018 Farm Bill and the more recent 2019 USDA
[14:31.780 --> 14:35.540]  interim final ruling, it doesn't matter the THC.
[14:35.540 --> 14:37.660]  It's THCA plus THC.
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.840]  Would people be okay with a GM hemp plant?
[14:45.840 --> 14:47.720]  Would people be okay with a GM hemp plant?
[14:47.720 --> 14:48.560]  No.
[14:49.720 --> 14:50.800]  I say no.
[14:52.600 --> 14:55.600]  Hemp has a bit of a reputation as a hippie plant.
[14:55.600 --> 14:58.480]  So I think people would be against it on principle.
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.080]  That's what the general tone of cannabis meeting is.
[15:02.080 --> 15:03.800]  I mean, there's a lot of cool things you could do
[15:03.800 --> 15:06.840]  if you could do a genetically modified cannabis plant,
[15:06.840 --> 15:11.080]  but market-wise, I don't think we're there as a society yet.
[15:13.240 --> 15:15.240]  If you put it in a male and you don't grow the males,
[15:15.240 --> 15:16.720]  yeah, that'd be great.
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.720]  That's essentially how the male sterile maize
[15:22.440 --> 15:25.440]  is allowed to be its GM,
[15:25.440 --> 15:27.240]  but it doesn't get into the hybrid.
[15:28.200 --> 15:31.680]  So that's how the Japanese market opened up real quick.
[15:31.680 --> 15:33.520]  And it doesn't go into the GM.
[15:33.520 --> 15:36.480]  It doesn't count because it doesn't go into the things
[15:36.480 --> 15:38.760]  that the Japanese were good at, no problem,
[15:38.760 --> 15:43.760]  except the maize hybrids that are produced by a GM process
[15:44.240 --> 15:46.360]  because the GM doesn't go into the hybrid.
[15:48.160 --> 15:50.400]  As one last minor note,
[15:50.400 --> 15:52.120]  if I'm talking about society of cannabis,
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.840]  which is a lot of fun, by the way.
[15:54.840 --> 15:56.640]  So there's a lot of misinformation out there.
[15:57.040 --> 15:59.200]  Even reputable CBD providers,
[15:59.200 --> 16:01.640]  or the seed providers or clone providers,
[16:01.640 --> 16:03.200]  they'll say that even feminized seeds
[16:03.200 --> 16:05.480]  are genetically modified when they're clearly not.
[16:05.480 --> 16:07.240]  It's strictly a hormonal treatment.
[16:08.280 --> 16:09.680]  So there's no genes changed,
[16:09.680 --> 16:10.960]  but you look at their website and they say,
[16:10.960 --> 16:12.160]  we don't sell feminized seed
[16:12.160 --> 16:13.440]  because it's genetically modified,
[16:13.440 --> 16:16.480]  but it's a lot of fun.
[16:16.480 --> 16:17.640]  All right.
[16:18.760 --> 16:20.120]  Yeah, let's thank Jacob one more time.
[16:20.120 --> 16:26.840]  This has been a production of Cornell University.
[16:26.840 --> 16:29.880]  On the web at cornell.edu.
