[00:00.000 --> 00:02.580]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.180 --> 00:09.180]  Morning everyone.
[00:10.140 --> 00:15.140]  Just to start off the hemp website up there, Cornell Hemp.
[00:16.660 --> 00:18.540]  All of the work we've done from a risk
[00:18.540 --> 00:21.980]  and economics perspective has been posted there
[00:21.980 --> 00:23.220]  and will be posted there.
[00:23.220 --> 00:27.580]  So we're gonna just kind of run quickly
[00:27.580 --> 00:30.080]  through some of the recent work.
[00:30.080 --> 00:35.080]  And then we'll be updating that material on the website.
[00:35.920 --> 00:40.920]  So two topics today, risk management in the hemp industry
[00:41.920 --> 00:45.060]  and then also some farm level economics.
[00:46.040 --> 00:48.280]  Funding for the first project
[00:48.280 --> 00:51.920]  was Northeast Extension Risk Management.
[00:51.920 --> 00:54.280]  And that was with Lindsey Pashow, myself
[00:54.280 --> 00:56.700]  and Heather Darby from Vermont.
[00:56.700 --> 00:59.780]  And then the economics was funded
[00:59.780 --> 01:02.700]  by Farm Viability Institute.
[01:02.700 --> 01:06.060]  And that was myself, Lindsey,
[01:06.060 --> 01:09.240]  Savannah Shalna and Daniela Bergauer.
[01:13.020 --> 01:15.640]  Okay, so really quickly,
[01:15.640 --> 01:18.700]  I'll be talking about five different, sorry.
[01:18.700 --> 01:23.460]  Yeah, five different sources of risk in agriculture.
[01:23.460 --> 01:28.260]  Production, marketing, legal, human resources
[01:28.260 --> 01:31.580]  and the financial risks.
[01:31.580 --> 01:36.220]  Possible strategies, what we found for, you know,
[01:36.220 --> 01:39.780]  this was a work group that met several times.
[01:39.780 --> 01:44.220]  So understand and implement best management practices
[01:44.220 --> 01:46.500]  was one of the keys.
[01:46.500 --> 01:50.340]  Timely information regarding legal considerations,
[01:50.340 --> 01:52.300]  price points, further research
[01:52.300 --> 01:56.060]  regarding optimal production systems and practices.
[01:56.060 --> 01:58.900]  And then a possible solution for some of the risks
[01:58.900 --> 02:00.760]  was vertically integrate.
[02:01.620 --> 02:04.420]  The cost and returns analysis that we did
[02:06.140 --> 02:07.500]  showed that what we did,
[02:07.500 --> 02:10.660]  we looked at three different production systems,
[02:10.660 --> 02:14.820]  a greenhouse, high tunnel and outdoors.
[02:14.820 --> 02:18.620]  And the revenue above variable costs
[02:18.660 --> 02:23.060]  was negative 3.84, negative 3.65
[02:23.060 --> 02:28.060]  and $1.78 per plant for the greenhouse, high tunnel
[02:29.100 --> 02:31.780]  and the outdoor horticultural systems.
[02:32.740 --> 02:36.700]  These results are very sensitive to variability
[02:36.700 --> 02:38.260]  and some of the key factors.
[02:38.260 --> 02:43.260]  We've looked at percentage of CBD and also the price.
[02:43.300 --> 02:44.820]  There are a lot of others that,
[02:45.940 --> 02:48.280]  and I'll mention a couple as we move through.
[02:49.620 --> 02:52.260]  Let's move through.
[02:52.260 --> 02:54.220]  So risk, I just wanna,
[02:54.220 --> 02:57.740]  so we're all familiar with some of the concepts
[02:57.740 --> 03:00.380]  we used for that first project.
[03:00.380 --> 03:03.980]  Risk is variability in outcomes or events,
[03:03.980 --> 03:07.020]  chance that what you expect to occur will not.
[03:07.020 --> 03:09.340]  In agriculture, you plant a crop
[03:09.340 --> 03:10.860]  in the beginning of the year.
[03:10.860 --> 03:14.500]  You have some idea in terms of what yield may be
[03:14.500 --> 03:18.260]  at the time of harvest, but it's not certain.
[03:18.940 --> 03:21.700]  You don't know what that yield is going to be.
[03:21.700 --> 03:24.340]  So that's an example.
[03:24.340 --> 03:27.540]  Characteristics, when we talk about risks,
[03:27.540 --> 03:30.180]  we recognize the variability,
[03:30.180 --> 03:33.300]  but one of the things that is a characteristic
[03:33.300 --> 03:37.220]  of when we speak of risk is that we have historical data
[03:37.220 --> 03:41.420]  that we can draw from for yields, for example.
[03:41.420 --> 03:44.860]  A farm has generally yields over time
[03:44.860 --> 03:47.660]  that they can look at to establish a mean
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.380]  and a range, et cetera.
[03:50.300 --> 03:52.540]  With something like hemp,
[03:52.540 --> 03:54.740]  unfortunately we're putting together
[03:54.740 --> 03:57.180]  some of that historical data.
[03:57.180 --> 04:02.180]  So risk versus uncertainty is something
[04:02.420 --> 04:04.340]  that we have to be thinking of.
[04:04.340 --> 04:07.060]  So the sources of agricultural risk,
[04:07.060 --> 04:09.740]  I mentioned those production, market,
[04:09.740 --> 04:11.960]  financial, legal, and human resources.
[04:11.960 --> 04:16.140]  Production is just anything to do with growing,
[04:16.140 --> 04:17.660]  harvesting the crop.
[04:17.660 --> 04:19.620]  Market and price, of course,
[04:19.620 --> 04:23.140]  quantity sold at what price.
[04:23.140 --> 04:26.980]  Financial is just traditional profit,
[04:26.980 --> 04:29.780]  other measures of economic performance.
[04:29.780 --> 04:34.780]  The legal aspects are one that are very critical
[04:34.900 --> 04:39.900]  for the hemp industry and tends to differ quite a lot
[04:40.300 --> 04:44.060]  from what our traditional farm business owners
[04:44.060 --> 04:45.340]  have to deal with.
[04:45.340 --> 04:47.380]  And then the human resources aspect.
[04:48.500 --> 04:53.500]  Strategies, avoid, reduce, retain, self-insure, shift.
[04:53.940 --> 04:57.700]  So a lot of people in the hemp industry,
[04:57.700 --> 04:59.940]  they've applied for licenses, et cetera,
[04:59.940 --> 05:01.780]  but they're avoiding the risk.
[05:01.780 --> 05:04.140]  They're just not going to take those enterprises
[05:04.140 --> 05:05.460]  on at this point.
[05:05.460 --> 05:10.460]  Reduce pest management aspects, for example,
[05:11.060 --> 05:14.340]  contracts, which I'll mention here in a bit.
[05:15.460 --> 05:19.500]  Retain, you just go about the business
[05:19.500 --> 05:22.940]  as you think is best and hope for the best.
[05:22.940 --> 05:27.940]  Self-insure, set aside some capital or finances
[05:28.800 --> 05:32.300]  for those cases where you may find that
[05:32.300 --> 05:35.740]  I wasn't able to harvest the amount that I wanted to,
[05:35.740 --> 05:40.020]  and now it's affecting the financial aspects
[05:40.020 --> 05:41.460]  of the business.
[05:41.460 --> 05:43.820]  And then shift, move it to somebody else,
[05:43.820 --> 05:46.260]  have somebody else bear that risk.
[05:46.260 --> 05:50.260]  Crop insurance is an example where you're
[05:50.260 --> 05:53.020]  an insurance company is accepting your premium
[05:53.020 --> 05:55.640]  and they will cover you in the event of a loss.
[06:00.420 --> 06:02.340]  So this is the risk management project.
[06:02.340 --> 06:07.340]  Again, this material will be on the hemp website.
[06:07.700 --> 06:11.580]  I'm really not gonna spend a lot of time on that
[06:11.580 --> 06:16.580]  other than we had about 100 individuals participated
[06:17.260 --> 06:20.060]  in one or more of the project activities.
[06:20.060 --> 06:21.780]  We had a web-based survey.
[06:21.780 --> 06:23.560]  We had two industry meetings,
[06:23.560 --> 06:26.420]  one in New York and one in Vermont,
[06:26.420 --> 06:28.700]  and then we hit in field days.
[06:28.700 --> 06:32.780]  And we had small group meetings where representatives
[06:32.780 --> 06:36.140]  from the different points in the supply chain
[06:36.140 --> 06:37.980]  met to discuss risks,
[06:37.980 --> 06:40.220]  what were some of the underlying causes
[06:40.220 --> 06:41.840]  and potential solutions.
[06:46.160 --> 06:49.240]  We'll just quickly,
[06:49.240 --> 06:51.600]  I think I'll just go right to,
[06:53.640 --> 06:54.900]  what were some of the solutions
[06:54.900 --> 06:58.060]  that the group came up with?
[06:58.060 --> 07:00.320]  So in terms of marketing,
[07:02.260 --> 07:04.900]  the group talked about vertically integrating.
[07:04.900 --> 07:09.000]  So a farm business owner, for example,
[07:09.240 --> 07:12.920]  they, when we're talking about the sources of risk
[07:12.920 --> 07:15.600]  in terms of marketing and the underlying reasons,
[07:16.520 --> 07:18.800]  people were mentioning things like,
[07:18.800 --> 07:21.160]  I don't have control over the product
[07:21.160 --> 07:24.360]  beyond the farm gate.
[07:24.360 --> 07:25.760]  How do you do that?
[07:25.760 --> 07:27.200]  How do you address that risk?
[07:27.200 --> 07:30.320]  And so one thing that we talked about
[07:30.320 --> 07:31.880]  was vertical integration.
[07:31.880 --> 07:36.160]  So process and some of the other activities
[07:36.160 --> 07:37.280]  up the supply chain.
[07:39.360 --> 07:41.840]  This contract aspect,
[07:41.840 --> 07:45.160]  it's very important that you understand
[07:45.160 --> 07:49.040]  best management practices for contracts.
[07:49.040 --> 07:53.600]  And Larry and Mary Ulrich put together
[07:55.520 --> 07:59.200]  a nice piece that's available on the website
[08:00.680 --> 08:04.600]  that tells you what a good contract should look like.
[08:04.600 --> 08:08.960]  And they're very important for ensuring
[08:09.800 --> 08:13.640]  that people understand what's going to be delivered,
[08:13.640 --> 08:16.200]  what quality, what price will be paid,
[08:16.200 --> 08:20.040]  and then any sort of repercussions
[08:20.040 --> 08:25.040]  if the contract isn't executed correctly.
[08:25.300 --> 08:29.000]  So that's an important piece that,
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.320]  and that's already in place.
[08:30.320 --> 08:34.320]  I don't know if Mary and Larry have plans to revise it,
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.320]  but on the website again is a very good resource for that.
[08:41.960 --> 08:44.480]  This next one is one that will sort of lead
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.760]  into the economics and increasing the capacity
[08:48.760 --> 08:50.400]  to determine price points.
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.320]  So that was a aspect of marketing risk that was mentioned.
[08:55.320 --> 08:59.040]  And what we talked about was that,
[09:00.400 --> 09:02.440]  we want to determine the,
[09:02.440 --> 09:04.840]  it's important to determine the price points,
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.640]  but we need information.
[09:06.640 --> 09:09.200]  For example, the cost of production.
[09:09.200 --> 09:12.420]  Yeah, I can look at a price that's out there,
[09:12.420 --> 09:14.360]  but what are my costs of production?
[09:14.360 --> 09:16.680]  How do I evaluate and assess
[09:16.680 --> 09:21.060]  whether that price is favorable or not?
[09:21.060 --> 09:24.160]  So the cost of production work
[09:24.160 --> 09:26.800]  that we've done in the economics at the farm level
[09:26.800 --> 09:31.800]  has been a key way that we're responding to that.
[09:32.120 --> 09:34.760]  But we probably need to look at that
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.680]  up the supply chain as well,
[09:36.680 --> 09:40.880]  in terms of what our price points, et cetera,
[09:40.880 --> 09:43.960]  beyond the farm production level.
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.280]  Testing capacity, that I think probably
[09:50.280 --> 09:53.760]  that was one of the topics that was talked about most
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.760]  in terms of clarification regarding testing requirements,
[09:59.760 --> 10:04.200]  who has to do it, who's going to bear the cost,
[10:04.200 --> 10:07.480]  how much can a grower, for example,
[10:07.480 --> 10:12.000]  spread those costs over plants or acres.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  So that's a critical source of risk that was talked about.
[10:19.440 --> 10:23.800]  And I think, I'm not sure where that goes,
[10:23.800 --> 10:28.040]  is someone that kind of stops at the farm level,
[10:28.120 --> 10:29.640]  that'll probably be something
[10:29.640 --> 10:32.760]  that the industry is going to have to address.
[10:32.760 --> 10:37.080]  Cooperatives were also mentioned as a way to improve
[10:37.080 --> 10:40.000]  not only the marketing of the output,
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.840]  but also obtaining inputs, et cetera.
[10:45.680 --> 10:50.360]  Okay, and then the legal risk contracts,
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.480]  you can see that a lot of the same things become repeated
[10:56.480 --> 10:59.560]  because they're interconnected,
[10:59.560 --> 11:04.120]  the legal, the financial, the marketing,
[11:04.120 --> 11:09.120]  and they all at some point tend to affect each other.
[11:12.840 --> 11:14.640]  I think I'm just going to,
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.160]  this will be on the website.
[11:18.160 --> 11:20.440]  And I think it was on the handout
[11:20.440 --> 11:22.480]  that was provided for this topic.
[11:23.480 --> 11:25.960]  So the other aspect of the work
[11:25.960 --> 11:29.880]  is a cost of production analysis.
[11:29.880 --> 11:33.240]  You saw back on the previous slide
[11:33.240 --> 11:35.600]  where we talked about sources of risk
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.120]  in terms of marketing, establishing price points.
[11:39.120 --> 11:41.760]  So one of the key things in terms of a grower
[11:41.760 --> 11:44.040]  is what are my costs of production?
[11:44.040 --> 11:47.000]  How do I evaluate these different price points?
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.680]  So we've spent, the group has spent quite a bit of time
[11:50.680 --> 11:52.240]  looking at cost of production.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.760]  We first for fiber and grain and dual purpose.
[11:55.760 --> 11:59.320]  We did some work a couple of years ago
[11:59.320 --> 12:02.280]  on hemp CBD in an outdoor setting.
[12:02.280 --> 12:04.200]  And then this work was put together
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.480]  to look at different production systems.
[12:07.480 --> 12:10.400]  So I'll just kind of,
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.280]  I like to acknowledge the help of several growers
[12:15.280 --> 12:20.040]  and processors there that did some Q&A sessions
[12:20.040 --> 12:23.960]  with Daniela and others.
[12:23.960 --> 12:26.680]  So that information was very valuable
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.680]  in addition to what we had from our experts.
[12:33.080 --> 12:37.560]  And then the Cornell Agritech Research Trials Groups.
[12:37.560 --> 12:41.240]  So those are sort of some acknowledgments.
[12:41.240 --> 12:43.000]  We're looking to estimate the value
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.920]  of production costs and returns
[12:46.920 --> 12:49.720]  for hemp by CBD production system.
[12:52.660 --> 12:57.660]  All right, so here's the first set of results
[12:57.660 --> 12:59.860]  that I'd like to talk about.
[12:59.860 --> 13:03.940]  So what we have are the three production systems,
[13:03.940 --> 13:06.620]  greenhouse, high tunnel and outdoor
[13:06.620 --> 13:08.820]  in a horticultural setting.
[13:08.820 --> 13:11.940]  And we're establishing a timeframe is critical
[13:11.940 --> 13:16.260]  if you're going to look at an analysis like this,
[13:16.260 --> 13:17.100]  looking at others.
[13:17.100 --> 13:19.260]  There are a number of other states
[13:19.300 --> 13:21.900]  that are putting together information.
[13:21.900 --> 13:24.660]  One of the key things probably you want to start with
[13:24.660 --> 13:28.780]  if you're comparing is look at the differences
[13:28.780 --> 13:31.780]  in any timeframe that's looked at.
[13:31.780 --> 13:33.860]  So we're starting with transplants.
[13:33.860 --> 13:38.060]  So we start with the value or the cost of that transplant.
[13:38.060 --> 13:41.740]  And then we follow the activities or the process
[13:41.740 --> 13:46.180]  through to the plants are hanging to dry.
[13:46.180 --> 13:49.220]  So that's the scenario that each
[13:49.220 --> 13:54.220]  of these different systems is examined under.
[13:54.420 --> 13:59.300]  So you see that the variable inputs fertilizer,
[13:59.300 --> 14:02.980]  well, hemp for so $6 per plant,
[14:02.980 --> 14:07.980]  initial assumptions were a one pound of biomass per plant
[14:08.620 --> 14:12.300]  at a six percentage point per pound of biomass
[14:12.300 --> 14:15.100]  and a dollar per point.
[14:15.100 --> 14:17.900]  So those were the original assumptions.
[14:17.900 --> 14:21.340]  So there's the $6 per plant.
[14:22.580 --> 14:26.220]  Fertilizer and lime are very similar of course,
[14:26.220 --> 14:28.820]  except for the outdoor horticultural
[14:28.820 --> 14:31.020]  because there's a cover crop going on.
[14:31.900 --> 14:34.340]  And so there's a little fertilizer
[14:34.340 --> 14:36.580]  to establish that cover crop.
[14:38.220 --> 14:43.220]  Seeds and plants, again, we used a $1.20.
[14:43.980 --> 14:47.940]  So when we had our group work,
[14:47.940 --> 14:51.780]  a dollar for the seed and 20 cents to establish,
[14:51.780 --> 14:54.060]  that was what we agreed upon.
[14:54.060 --> 14:58.020]  The outdoor setting includes some cover crop seed.
[14:59.340 --> 15:01.940]  This is a factor that when you're looking
[15:01.940 --> 15:06.940]  at other analyses, you really have to pay attention
[15:07.540 --> 15:10.220]  to what's being used there.
[15:10.260 --> 15:13.900]  For example, there was some work out of Alabama
[15:13.900 --> 15:17.420]  earlier this year, and I was looking at that
[15:17.420 --> 15:19.660]  and look just to see where our estimates
[15:19.660 --> 15:22.300]  were falling into place.
[15:22.300 --> 15:27.300]  And comparing to this, to our work, to the Alabama work,
[15:27.420 --> 15:30.860]  it was the costs were much less.
[15:30.860 --> 15:35.860]  And it's one of the things is they used a $4 per plant
[15:36.820 --> 15:38.420]  for the transplant.
[15:38.420 --> 15:42.660]  So the results are going to be very sensitive
[15:42.660 --> 15:46.940]  to those kinds of things.
[15:48.940 --> 15:53.940]  Sprays, a biofungicide for the indoor settings,
[15:55.180 --> 15:59.140]  and then other inputs, other crop inputs.
[15:59.140 --> 16:04.140]  We've talked a bit about testing this morning.
[16:04.860 --> 16:09.860]  So testing is a big factor there in terms of that category.
[16:13.020 --> 16:15.460]  And just that there was a question earlier
[16:15.460 --> 16:17.180]  about what are some of the fees.
[16:17.180 --> 16:22.180]  So we used about $300 for a heavy metal
[16:25.300 --> 16:27.820]  pesticide residue tests.
[16:27.820 --> 16:32.340]  And then there was a testing fee of about 250 to 300
[16:32.380 --> 16:36.980]  for the traditional THC and other testing.
[16:36.980 --> 16:41.980]  So you can see that for a given crop or a given year,
[16:44.580 --> 16:47.860]  that's a pretty significant number.
[16:47.860 --> 16:50.660]  And so that's where we talk about
[16:50.660 --> 16:53.900]  who's going to bear that cost and that sort of thing.
[16:53.900 --> 16:58.900]  So our assumption there was that we took half of the cost
[16:59.740 --> 17:04.740]  and put it into that spray or other crop inputs.
[17:05.220 --> 17:09.700]  So that's where the indoor settings
[17:09.700 --> 17:11.380]  are going to be at a disadvantage.
[17:11.380 --> 17:14.540]  They're spreading that cost over fewer units,
[17:14.540 --> 17:16.980]  whereas the outdoor setting,
[17:16.980 --> 17:21.660]  we're looking at 1,500 plants per acre.
[17:21.660 --> 17:26.660]  The indoor setting was 120 plants for one growing season.
[17:28.900 --> 17:31.180]  So that's a major difference
[17:31.180 --> 17:33.500]  between the systems at this point.
[17:33.500 --> 17:37.460]  And really, I think someone mentioned earlier,
[17:37.460 --> 17:39.660]  or I saw at some point,
[17:39.660 --> 17:42.580]  sort of the disadvantage of those indoor systems
[17:42.580 --> 17:44.460]  on a fairly small scale.
[17:46.620 --> 17:49.560]  Labor, of course, is a big one.
[17:50.940 --> 17:54.100]  Indoors or in the greenhouse setting,
[17:54.300 --> 17:59.300]  the key there was that's about 31 hours
[18:00.660 --> 18:04.700]  in terms of labor hours.
[18:04.700 --> 18:09.340]  And a lot of that is in pruning.
[18:09.340 --> 18:12.020]  That's where the vast majority is.
[18:12.020 --> 18:17.020]  And then we have probably five to $4 for harvest.
[18:20.140 --> 18:21.820]  And this is for the structure,
[18:22.740 --> 18:26.220]  miscellaneous daily tasks,
[18:26.220 --> 18:28.700]  and then some cleanup and that sort of thing.
[18:28.700 --> 18:33.700]  So those are the hours for the indoor setting,
[18:36.180 --> 18:37.420]  for the greenhouse.
[18:37.420 --> 18:40.280]  And then the high tunnel is similar
[18:40.280 --> 18:43.080]  in terms of what's going on there,
[18:43.080 --> 18:45.740]  in terms of the cost per plant.
[18:45.740 --> 18:47.020]  And we see that the labor
[18:47.020 --> 18:52.020]  for the outdoor horticultural is about half.
[18:52.460 --> 18:55.380]  And there's mechanized planting.
[18:55.380 --> 18:57.380]  The transplant operation is mechanized
[18:57.380 --> 19:00.240]  with a tractor, a planter, and two people.
[19:00.240 --> 19:05.080]  So that's contributing to a lower per unit cost.
[19:06.180 --> 19:10.100]  And then actually, then the outdoor setting
[19:10.100 --> 19:13.140]  gets pretty expensive when it comes to the labor
[19:13.140 --> 19:16.800]  that's used in terms of pruning, harvest, and hanging.
[19:20.130 --> 19:21.370]  Wow.
[19:21.370 --> 19:25.130]  All right, so those are some of the keys
[19:25.130 --> 19:27.930]  that I wanted to get out there.
[19:27.930 --> 19:31.450]  Those are the results that we have to date.
[19:31.450 --> 19:32.890]  We're working on this project
[19:32.890 --> 19:36.090]  probably for the end of this year
[19:36.090 --> 19:41.090]  to finalize and come up with some firmer estimates.
[19:41.930 --> 19:45.930]  You can see that the returns there,
[19:45.930 --> 19:48.130]  again, that's what I mentioned earlier,
[19:48.130 --> 19:51.490]  returns above variable input costs,
[19:51.490 --> 19:56.490]  negative, almost $4 per plant for the indoor settings,
[19:56.650 --> 20:01.570]  and then $1.80 for the outdoor setting.
[20:01.570 --> 20:03.530]  And again, a lot of this is the ability
[20:03.530 --> 20:05.190]  to spread some of those,
[20:06.730 --> 20:09.690]  like the testing fees and other costs
[20:09.690 --> 20:12.570]  that are fixed like licensing, et cetera,
[20:12.570 --> 20:14.410]  over greater units.
[20:15.290 --> 20:16.130]  Okay.
[20:18.370 --> 20:21.510]  Let me just, there's some sensitivity analysis.
[20:22.770 --> 20:24.610]  I think I just wanted to,
[20:24.610 --> 20:28.130]  so that last bullet item there, items,
[20:28.130 --> 20:31.470]  just make sure that you understand the timeframe used,
[20:32.570 --> 20:35.690]  the value of these transplants seem to vary,
[20:35.690 --> 20:38.450]  at least what are being used in the analysis
[20:38.450 --> 20:42.290]  vary quite a bit, the product testing expense,
[20:42.290 --> 20:43.590]  and then labor charges.
[20:45.700 --> 20:46.540]  That's it.
[20:46.540 --> 20:47.360]  Okay.
[20:47.360 --> 20:48.200]  Thanks, John.
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.040]  Thank you.
[20:49.040 --> 20:56.120]  Thank you.
[20:56.120 --> 20:56.960]  All right.
[20:56.960 --> 21:00.200]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[21:00.200 --> 21:03.040]  on the web at cornell.edu.
