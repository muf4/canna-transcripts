[00:00.380 --> 00:05.540]  Hello and welcome everybody to the Cornell Hemp Field Days. My name is Jacob Tost and
[00:05.540 --> 00:10.860]  I'm a PhD candidate in Larry's Smart Lab and today I'll be talking about molecular breeding
[00:10.860 --> 00:19.760]  of hemp. For my talk today, I'll be discussing some of the theory and ideas behind molecular
[00:19.760 --> 00:24.360]  breeding of hemp and give an example of how we're using molecular breeding in our research
[00:24.360 --> 00:31.360]  program to develop a high yielding fiber cultivar that has low levels of THC to stay compliant
[00:31.360 --> 00:38.420]  as well as produces high levels of CBD. It is important to recognize the contribution
[00:38.420 --> 00:43.440]  of genetics and environment to your trade of interest for any breeding endeavor. So
[00:43.440 --> 00:50.520]  how the plant grows, the phenotype, is the result of both the genetics of the plant as
[00:50.520 --> 00:56.080]  well as the environment. The genetics of the plant, also known as the genotype, refers
[00:56.080 --> 01:04.100]  to the DNA of the plant, the genes and other DNA which make up the plant's genome. So many
[01:04.100 --> 01:10.840]  important traits such as yield are heavily influenced by both the genotype and the environment,
[01:10.840 --> 01:15.720]  but some traits such as photoperiod dependence and cannabinoid type are heavily influenced
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.440]  by genotype alone. Concerning photoperiod dependence, if you look at this picture here,
[01:21.440 --> 01:27.120]  the small plant is photoperiod independent and started flowering almost immediately after
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.640]  planting, while the larger plant, which is photoperiod dependent, didn't start flowering
[01:32.640 --> 01:39.680]  until the night length hit a certain threshold. So another important trait that is influenced
[01:39.680 --> 01:45.960]  heavily by genotype in cannabis is cannabinoid type, and breeding for cannabinoid type is
[01:45.960 --> 01:55.840]  a fundamental part of any hemp breeding. So what is molecular breeding? So in molecular
[01:55.840 --> 02:01.040]  breeding, very broadly, instead of just looking at the phenotype of the plant, which is the
[02:01.040 --> 02:09.920]  result of both the genotype and the environment, you look at the actual DNA. So advances in
[02:09.920 --> 02:17.880]  molecular biology have allowed much easier analysis of DNA, and because the DNA is the
[02:17.880 --> 02:23.880]  same in every cell of a plant, whether it's young or whether it's old, being able to assay
[02:23.880 --> 02:28.840]  a plant just by looking at the DNA allows you to look at certain traits before they're
[02:28.840 --> 02:34.200]  even expressed. For instance, to determine if a plant is going to be male or female,
[02:34.200 --> 02:42.320]  or if it's going to produce mostly THC or mostly CBD. So with molecular breeding, you
[02:42.320 --> 02:48.800]  can develop new cultivars based on the genotype alone, and when done accurately, this can
[02:48.800 --> 02:54.960]  result in less expensive phenotyping, and ultimately reducing the cost and reducing
[02:54.960 --> 03:03.850]  the time it takes to develop a new cultivar. Now I'm going to talk a little bit about how
[03:03.890 --> 03:09.930]  our research group is using molecular breeding to develop new elite, high-yielding fiber
[03:09.930 --> 03:16.810]  cultivars that have compliant levels of THC. In 2019, we grew several varieties for grain
[03:16.810 --> 03:22.810]  and fiber production, including two cultivars from China called Dama and Puma. We didn't
[03:22.810 --> 03:27.850]  know much about these cultivars when we first planted them, aside from a little blurb for
[03:27.850 --> 03:34.570]  Puma which claimed to have high CBD seeds, high leaves and flowers output. When these
[03:34.570 --> 03:39.010]  plants were grown, we were quite impressed by the plants in that they had extremely large
[03:39.010 --> 03:45.570]  leaves and extremely fast growth rate, and would routinely hit 10 feet tall. When we
[03:45.570 --> 03:50.370]  harvested these plants and readied them to measure the fiber yield, we found that Dama
[03:50.370 --> 03:57.330]  and Puma had nearly double the biomass yield of other elite cultivars grown for fiber.
[03:57.330 --> 04:01.570]  Because of this, we thought that Dama and Puma would make excellent fiber cultivars.
[04:01.570 --> 04:08.170]  However, when we looked at the cannabinoids, we found that both Puma and Dama produced
[04:08.170 --> 04:19.010]  THC at levels exceeding 0.3% and would be non-compliant in the modern regulatory framework.
[04:19.010 --> 04:23.290]  We looked further at the cannabinoids that Puma and Dama were producing, and we found
[04:23.290 --> 04:29.130]  that they were relatively high in cannabinoids, with Puma producing a little over 1.5% total
[04:29.130 --> 04:35.650]  cannabinoids and Dama sometimes exceeding 2% total cannabinoids. This is considerably
[04:35.650 --> 04:43.290]  higher than what other fiber cultivars produced in terms of total cannabinoids. Additionally,
[04:43.290 --> 04:48.250]  we sampled these plants when they were just starting to flower, so we hypothesized that
[04:48.250 --> 04:52.530]  as the plant became more mature, the total cannabinoids would increase even further.
[04:52.770 --> 05:01.130]  However, the big problem was that Puma and Dama produced THC as a major cannabinoid,
[05:01.130 --> 05:05.730]  which isn't what we wanted. So ultimately, what we would like in a cultivar would be
[05:05.730 --> 05:11.770]  something that produces as much dry biomass as Puma and Dama, but instead of producing
[05:11.770 --> 05:21.860]  THC, produces CBD. And to achieve that goal, we turned to molecular breeding.
[05:21.860 --> 05:26.940]  So to understand what we did for molecular breeding, it's first important to understand
[05:26.940 --> 05:33.300]  the different chemotypes that are found in cannabis. So there are three important chemotypes
[05:33.300 --> 05:38.660]  that I'll talk about right now. There's type 1, which is mostly THC. There's type 2, which
[05:38.660 --> 05:45.500]  is CBD to THC at about a 2 to 1 ratio, but this number can vary. And then there's type
[05:45.500 --> 05:54.020]  3, which produces mostly CBD. So if you're growing a population or a cultivar for CBD,
[05:54.020 --> 05:59.500]  you'd expect all the plants to be type 3. But in 2018 and 2019, we found that some of
[05:59.500 --> 06:06.100]  the plants that we were growing were in fact type 2 or even type 1, producing almost no
[06:06.100 --> 06:13.700]  CBD. Using this data, and this figure in the top here shows data from 2018, we developed
[06:13.700 --> 06:18.740]  a molecular marker, which looks at the DNA of the plants and can distinguish type 1 from
[06:18.740 --> 06:25.660]  type 2 and type 3 plants. So getting back to Dama and Puma, when we were looking at
[06:25.660 --> 06:33.980]  the THC to CBD ratio for these plants, we saw that it was about a 2 to 1 ratio of CBD
[06:33.980 --> 06:40.980]  to THC, which would suggest that most of the plants that we were sampling were type 2.
[06:40.980 --> 06:46.340]  So an interesting thing about these type 2 plants is that they won't breed true. If
[06:46.340 --> 06:51.380]  there's a population which is freely intercrossing with a lot of these type 2 plants, you'd expect
[06:51.380 --> 06:58.300]  to see a certain number to be type 1 and a certain number to be type 3. So we didn't
[06:58.300 --> 07:04.620]  have the HPLC, the chemical data on a lot of different plants from Dama and Puma. We
[07:04.620 --> 07:10.820]  were just looking at pooled samples. But we could apply this molecular marker to these
[07:10.820 --> 07:17.220]  populations and distinguish the different plants that were in these different chemotypes.
[07:17.220 --> 07:22.060]  So late last year, around December, we grew about 100 plants each of Dama and Puma and
[07:22.060 --> 07:26.540]  tested them with this marker that we developed. And as expected, we found that about half
[07:26.540 --> 07:32.060]  of the plants were type 2, and we found that about a third of the plants were type 3, and
[07:32.060 --> 07:40.060]  the remainder were type 1. So what we did was we selected the type 3, and in theory,
[07:40.060 --> 07:47.620]  these plants should form an excellent basis for a high-producing fiber cultivar that produces
[07:47.620 --> 07:50.100]  mostly CBD.
[07:50.100 --> 07:58.820]  However, after selection of these type 3 plants, we run into a few problems with their propagation.
[07:58.820 --> 08:04.420]  So these plants, which are so vigorous in the field, were also very vigorous in a greenhouse,
[08:04.420 --> 08:10.020]  and they grew extremely fast and extremely tall, sometimes in excess of 14 feet. They
[08:10.020 --> 08:16.460]  were also quite susceptible to various greenhouse pathogens such as thrips and spider mites.
[08:16.460 --> 08:22.900]  To make matters worse, they appear to be very photoperiod-dependent and did not flower in
[08:22.900 --> 08:27.820]  the greenhouse in the spring when we were growing them. There were also some issues
[08:27.820 --> 08:33.180]  with cutting propagation. These plants form a very nice single stem, as you can see in
[08:33.180 --> 08:39.940]  this photo here, but it's not always simple to take a cutting and root that very nice
[08:39.940 --> 08:40.940]  stem.
[08:40.940 --> 08:46.460]  So to address this, we're attempting to grow the plants in the field. We've planted them
[08:46.460 --> 08:52.940]  out and hopefully will harvest some grain at the end of the season, which will form
[08:52.940 --> 08:58.860]  a good basis for scale up. And we've also sent the cuttings of these plants to a collaborator
[08:58.860 --> 09:06.620]  in Florida who should be able to grow the plants without any issue.
[09:06.620 --> 09:12.700]  In summary, molecular breeding involves selection on the genotype, on the DNA directly.
[09:12.700 --> 09:19.420]  Bama and Puma, two cultivars from China, are high biomass producers, but they produce high
[09:19.420 --> 09:26.660]  non-compliant levels of THC. Selection in Bama and Puma for chemotype 3 plants using
[09:26.660 --> 09:33.940]  a molecular marker should produce a high-yielding compliant fiber cultivar. These plants here
[09:33.940 --> 09:42.000]  growing in the field in New York should form the basis of a new compliant fiber cultivar.
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.060]  We hope to harvest the seeds at the end of the season, scale them up, ensure that the
[09:47.060 --> 09:55.100]  resulted plants have the same biomass potential as the parent Bama and Puma populations, and
[09:55.100 --> 09:58.260]  eventually potentially release new cultivars.
