[00:01.720 --> 00:05.720]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:05.720 --> 00:13.280]  Thanks, Larry.
[00:13.280 --> 00:17.280]  Thanks to the student crowd here today.
[00:17.280 --> 00:25.280]  I'd like to start out by introducing the people in my group that are actually, have actually been working with hemp diseases.
[00:25.280 --> 00:31.280]  I'll tell you what I think about hemp diseases, but I'd like to, first of all, Jamie Cummings is here,
[00:31.280 --> 00:39.280]  who has been with my program for a number of years, is now with the IPM program, but kind of got us started on some of our hemp work.
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.280]  Kevin, you want to raise your hand there? Kevin Myers?
[00:43.280 --> 00:49.280]  And now Jen Starr is my research and extension support specialist.
[00:49.280 --> 00:59.280]  So what I'd really like you to know is when you're out in your hemp fields and you're finding things you think may be diseases,
[00:59.280 --> 01:09.280]  if you notice something, say something, let us know, get in contact with one of us, and we'd like to diagnose the problem.
[01:09.280 --> 01:21.280]  Like any other new crop, there are a set of pests, insects, weeds, diseases that will be eventually a problem in the production of that crop.
[01:21.280 --> 01:31.280]  And of course this is the second year out with this new crop in New York State, unless you go way back when it might have been grown previously.
[01:31.280 --> 01:39.280]  But in recent history, it's all new to us, and that includes the plant pathologists that are working on this.
[01:39.280 --> 01:51.280]  So with our one year of experience, last year under our belt, we saw about a dozen different microbial organisms that we found that cause disease on hemp.
[01:51.280 --> 02:00.280]  And these vary everything from things that cause a rotting in the root system that can affect the seedling establishment of the crop,
[02:00.280 --> 02:06.280]  to things that cause a lot of fungi that cause spots on leaves, blighting on leaves.
[02:06.280 --> 02:14.280]  And then we saw things also in the buds, in the heads, the flower parts, the seeds.
[02:14.280 --> 02:23.280]  Very often we found something we would call gray mold, the botrytis, a fungal problem infesting the buds.
[02:23.280 --> 02:30.280]  But by and large, the message is that most of the industrial hemp that we've seen has been pretty darn healthy.
[02:31.280 --> 02:38.280]  As you may know, and you're going to hear more about today, there are different classes and uses of industrial hemp.
[02:38.280 --> 02:45.280]  From the CBD types, to the grain types, to the fiber types, etc. And you're going to hear about that.
[02:45.280 --> 02:51.280]  And so there's a lot of different genetics out there in these fields, and I'm sure Larry and others are going to talk about that.
[02:51.280 --> 02:59.280]  But that means there's a lot of diversity in the crop that brings about a corresponding diversity in the microbes that cause disease.
[02:59.280 --> 03:08.280]  So we're definitely seeing in some of the CBD types more of a susceptibility to some of the leaf spot pathogens, for instance.
[03:08.280 --> 03:14.280]  So I'm not going to try to clutter your minds with a lot of Latin names of microbes today.
[03:14.280 --> 03:22.280]  But again, what I'd like to leave you knowing is that we're trying to get an early handle on these things.
[03:23.280 --> 03:32.280]  Eventually, what we'd like to see is, with Larry, is to try to make selections in these different classes where he's doing the breeding
[03:32.280 --> 03:41.280]  and seeing if we can't increase the level of natural genetic disease resistance, which would be our first line of defense.
[03:41.280 --> 03:51.280]  I think you're all aware, and you will hear from others here today, that because of its status as a non-crop, officially at this point,
[03:51.280 --> 04:01.280]  there are none of the FIFRA-labeled materials for control of pests, and that includes diseases, even things like seed treatments,
[04:01.280 --> 04:04.280]  that Alan's going to talk to you a little bit more about.
[04:04.280 --> 04:09.280]  But eventually, we hope, as the classification of this crop moves along from the federal government,
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.280]  to kind of keep up with what's going on at the state level,
[04:13.280 --> 04:23.280]  that we will be starting to look at different kinds of pest management materials, including synthetic chemicals,
[04:23.280 --> 04:28.280]  as well as organically-approved materials for organic production.
[04:28.280 --> 04:35.280]  Right now, the best thing we can do is start out with some sound cultural practices.
[04:35.280 --> 04:38.280]  And I think you'll hear this over and over again today.
[04:38.280 --> 04:41.280]  Rotation is our greatest threat.
[04:41.280 --> 04:48.280]  There's less likely to be disease impact if you grow in sequence fairly unrelated crops.
[04:48.280 --> 05:01.280]  So hemp being a broadleaf crop, probably its best rotational partners would be things like small grain cereals and corn, the grasses, the monocots.
[05:01.280 --> 05:09.280]  We have some commonality in some of the pests, especially across some other broadleaf crops.
[05:09.280 --> 05:15.280]  We're going to learn more about that as we go, but one of the biggest problems we have is white mold
[05:15.280 --> 05:19.280]  that anybody that grows soybeans or vegetables is well-acquainted with.
[05:19.280 --> 05:28.280]  And so a rotation with soybeans or some of the more susceptible vegetable crops is probably not the greatest choice
[05:28.280 --> 05:32.280]  because of susceptibility to white mold.
[05:32.280 --> 05:35.280]  And we're learning other connections like that.
[05:36.280 --> 05:43.280]  A lot of the disease organisms, some of the fungal leaf spots, are very specific to a particular species of plant.
[05:43.280 --> 05:49.280]  And so it's not so much a problem there, the rotational sequence of crops,
[05:49.280 --> 05:55.280]  but looking at variation in the varieties and the cultivars of industrial hemp.
[05:55.280 --> 05:58.280]  Some are going to be more susceptible to others.
[05:58.280 --> 06:03.280]  As we go along and working with Larry and his program, I think we're going to learn more and more about that.
[06:03.280 --> 06:09.280]  So again, my message to you here today is if you see something that appears to be a disease,
[06:09.280 --> 06:13.280]  we're in the business of diagnosing that and trying to get a handle on it.
[06:13.280 --> 06:16.280]  We'd love to work with you. So thank you.
[06:16.280 --> 06:17.280]  Thank you.
[06:17.280 --> 06:25.350]  We have a couple of minutes for questions. Are there any questions for Gary?
[06:25.350 --> 06:26.350]  Yeah.
[06:26.350 --> 06:31.000]  How do you get those to your tree?
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  Okay. So we have a laboratory in Ithaca.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  And maybe we can put that on your hemp website too.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  That might be the easiest thing is we can put a diagnosis of plant disease,
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  we can put that on the website.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  Otherwise, my email is gcb3 at cornell.edu.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  But I think that's probably the best thing we can do is put something on the general Cornell hemp website.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  I'd be glad to give you a card too today.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  Yes, sir.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  I was wondering what the list of diseases are for trees.
[07:10.000 --> 07:21.040]  You know, the question here is do we have a listing of varieties and by diseases about relative susceptibilities.
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.040]  And quite honestly, we're so early into that cycle of trying to understand that,
[07:26.040 --> 07:29.040]  that we kind of have a shopping list of things we have seen.
[07:29.040 --> 07:33.040]  But to partition it out that finely, we're not there yet.
[07:33.040 --> 07:39.040]  And of course, this is a very dry, warm, early part of the growing season.
[07:39.040 --> 07:41.040]  We'll see how that ends up.
[07:41.040 --> 07:47.040]  But up to this point in the growing season, there has not been an intensity of diseases.
[07:47.040 --> 07:50.040]  We've had to look very hard to find any at all.
[07:50.040 --> 07:52.040]  So good news, bad news.
[07:52.040 --> 07:56.040]  But last year we catalogued quite a few different pathogens.
[07:57.040 --> 08:02.040]  As far as which ones are going to become really severe, that's still a lot of guesswork.
[08:02.040 --> 08:07.040]  There's not even really an extensive world literature on this, interestingly enough.
[08:07.040 --> 08:10.040]  So we're very much in the learning mode here.
[08:10.040 --> 08:34.160]  So the question is a good one about if we've used any kind of inhibitors, natural products, whatever, the soil biome itself.
[08:34.160 --> 08:36.160]  The short answer is no.
[08:36.160 --> 08:38.160]  I think there's a lot of possibilities there.
[08:38.160 --> 08:42.160]  But with the learning curve, we're here somewhere.
[08:43.160 --> 08:47.160]  Those are some of our aspirations as we move along with this.
[08:47.160 --> 08:52.160]  And I might point out, I'm sure Larry will, that we're not in this by ourselves.
[08:52.160 --> 08:54.160]  There are 35 other states.
[08:54.160 --> 09:02.160]  So the question was referring to connecting with the State Department of Environmental Conservation,
[09:02.160 --> 09:10.900]  which we are in good communication with the CDC.
[09:11.900 --> 09:21.900]  But really, even above that, there are no EPA permits, no national permits for use of any of these plant disease control materials.
[09:21.900 --> 09:25.900]  So even before it got to the state regulatory board, there's nothing allowed.
[09:25.900 --> 09:32.900]  Now there are some things that are on the GRASS list that are used for food processing and whatnot.
[09:32.900 --> 09:35.900]  And maybe you're going to deal with that a little bit.
[09:35.900 --> 09:37.900]  Maybe Alan can talk a little bit about that.
[09:37.900 --> 09:41.900]  But there are some materials that might be useful in certain things.
[09:41.900 --> 09:48.900]  But in general, we don't really have any tools in our arsenal right now for disease or insect control.
[09:48.900 --> 09:49.900]  Yes, sir.
[09:55.900 --> 10:11.270]  Okay, maybe we can talk about that a little later.
[10:11.270 --> 10:12.270]  But thank you.
[10:12.270 --> 10:13.270]  Thank you.
[10:19.880 --> 10:22.880]  First of all, I want to make sure I had it a little bit late.
[10:22.880 --> 10:26.880]  If you came in late, this is the handbook I'm going to be going through.
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.880]  There's extra copies up here if anybody needs those.
[10:30.880 --> 10:32.880]  Lots of eating grits.
[10:32.880 --> 10:36.880]  Just raise your hand if you'd still like to have it on a copy of this.
[10:36.880 --> 10:38.880]  There are some people in the back.
[10:41.880 --> 10:46.880]  So I'm based here at the Aggie's Terminal Station.
[10:46.880 --> 10:48.880]  And we're at the top of Cornell-Hancock.
[10:49.880 --> 10:51.880]  I'm just getting used to saying that right now.
[10:51.880 --> 10:56.880]  We've been at the New York State Agricultural Station for the past 130 or so years.
[10:58.880 --> 11:01.880]  But my area is in seed science and technology.
[11:01.880 --> 11:09.880]  So I have my nature of my program, but also my own interest is to work with new crops.
[11:09.880 --> 11:13.880]  Especially those that are going to have really a benefit for New York State.
[11:13.880 --> 11:17.880]  And I think that the hemp is really one that fits into that.
[11:18.880 --> 11:22.880]  Where there's many seed challenges, and it is really a new crop.
[11:22.880 --> 11:28.880]  As Gary talked about in his presentation, there's some things we kind of expect.
[11:28.880 --> 11:31.880]  There's some things that we simply haven't ever worked on.
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.880]  You can't look up somebody else's work to really know that much.
[11:35.880 --> 11:40.880]  So we're really trying to establish some really sound science.
[11:40.880 --> 11:45.880]  That science, that applied science, can be translated into outreach and extension
[11:45.880 --> 11:48.880]  to benefit our New York agricultural community.
[11:49.880 --> 11:51.880]  How did we get here?
[11:51.880 --> 11:59.880]  If we look at the 2014 Farm Bill, it allowed states to go ahead and work on research on hemp.
[11:59.880 --> 12:02.880]  Several states have done this.
[12:02.880 --> 12:08.880]  New York has really got into this in a big way last year and an even bigger way this year.
[12:08.880 --> 12:12.880]  I contacted Ag and Markets and we're looking at 3,200 acres of hemp
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.880]  that are grown here in New York State.
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.880]  This side of the Mississippi, some of the major states, Kentucky, North Carolina,
[12:21.880 --> 12:27.880]  and then you go to the mountain states of Colorado, the largest, and Oregon on the west coast.
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.880]  So quite a substantial industry.
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.880]  And we also learned a lot from other countries, in particular our neighbors to the north.
[12:37.880 --> 12:39.880]  Canada has over 110,000 acres.
[12:40.880 --> 12:45.880]  So more of a mature industry there that we can rely on for seed companies,
[12:45.880 --> 12:49.880]  for getting plant materials as far as seed sources.
[12:49.880 --> 12:55.880]  So in your picture, probably if you've already been growing hemp, you know what the seeds look like.
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.880]  If you actually put a seed on top of the farm, this is about the actual size of the seed.
[13:01.880 --> 13:05.880]  This is just one of the commercial lots that was used extensively last year
[13:05.880 --> 13:10.880]  in some of the farmer trials called ANCA.
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.880]  And we did not adulterate the photo there on the left.
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.880]  There is just a huge range of seed sizes.
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.880]  And if you're working with any other crops, if you work with field crops or vegetable crops,
[13:23.880 --> 13:28.880]  you know the seed companies have done a much better job of sorting seeds by size.
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.880]  So that's kind of the first thing is that we deal about irregular shaped seeds.
[13:34.880 --> 13:38.880]  We've done enough work with those small seeds that really just produce run plants.
[13:38.880 --> 13:43.880]  They're really just kind of just there, part of the seed count.
[13:43.880 --> 13:45.880]  But they're really not that productive.
[13:45.880 --> 13:51.880]  Anyway, starting off with those lost seeds, my goal in working with Gary's program
[13:51.880 --> 13:57.880]  is we're trying to be proactive in looking at seed treatments for the future.
[13:57.880 --> 14:01.880]  In the 2018 Farm Bill, as we look at that one,
[14:01.880 --> 14:05.880]  if all goes well, hemp should be exempted from the DEA,
[14:05.880 --> 14:13.880]  which is really going to open up a floodgate for having it being grown just as any other vegetable or field crop.
[14:13.880 --> 14:15.880]  So it would also allow the pesticide.
[14:15.880 --> 14:19.880]  We're trying to be proactive in that and looking ahead.
[14:19.880 --> 14:24.880]  Those of you working in the vegetable or specialty crops area are familiar with the IR4.
[14:25.880 --> 14:31.880]  IR4 works with university partners and others to foster the registration of materials,
[14:31.880 --> 14:35.880]  both chemical and biological organic.
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.880]  And so IR4 has a program, they're allowed to work with hemp.
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.880]  There's a program now at NC State on weed control.
[14:43.880 --> 14:48.880]  And so we're kind of trying to get our foot in the door for next year, for 2019.
[14:49.880 --> 14:54.880]  So one part of that is, besides the different materials that we apply,
[14:54.880 --> 14:58.880]  either chemical or biopesticide, is how we're going to apply that.
[14:58.880 --> 15:01.880]  So my laboratory has done a lot in that area.
[15:01.880 --> 15:05.880]  So if we use our standard kind of a slurry technique, that's what the grain is,
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.880]  yeah, we're getting materials on the seed and the color, but you can see a lack of uniformity.
[15:10.880 --> 15:15.880]  So we're trying to spend some time kind of upgrading the seed technology.
[15:15.880 --> 15:19.880]  So now we can see with the proper use of different seed coating materials,
[15:19.880 --> 15:21.880]  we can get a very uniform end product.
[15:21.880 --> 15:25.880]  And that's really what we need to as we're going to be moving into that.
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.880]  Again, kind of working to try to establish ourselves with an IR4.
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.880]  I've worked with that entity for many years.
[15:34.880 --> 15:38.880]  Again, looking at chemical seed treatments for direct seeding,
[15:38.880 --> 15:42.880]  but also to look at biopesticides, which would be your organic materials.
[15:42.880 --> 15:48.880]  That's kind of next year's presentation, so again, I'm just kind of looking ahead for that.
[15:48.880 --> 15:54.880]  We're going to change gears now into seed testing, seed quality management.
[15:54.880 --> 15:57.880]  Standardized testing procedures are in place.
[15:57.880 --> 16:01.880]  They've been in place for many years, as it is for other crops, field crops.
[16:01.880 --> 16:05.880]  Using a roll pile test, we're looking at two samples of hemp,
[16:05.880 --> 16:07.880]  and these are from testing samples.
[16:07.880 --> 16:12.880]  We had 23 seed lots that are being used for field trials this year.
[16:12.880 --> 16:16.880]  And my laboratory did both the germination and the purity.
[16:16.880 --> 16:18.880]  We'll talk about the purity in just a moment.
[16:18.880 --> 16:21.880]  But if you can look at that photo, you can see the ones on the left.
[16:21.880 --> 16:27.880]  Very poor germination, lack of uniformity, and the photo turned out pretty well,
[16:27.880 --> 16:30.880]  but there's just a lot of mold growth and things like that.
[16:30.880 --> 16:38.880]  So there can be actually internal soil-borne pathogens, cell-borne diseases, within the seeds,
[16:38.880 --> 16:40.880]  and that is going to kind of proliferate.
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.880]  So again, kind of another need for having effective seed treatment in control there.
[16:46.880 --> 16:51.880]  What we'd like to do is have what looks like a roll pile on the right-hand side
[16:51.880 --> 16:55.880]  with very uniform seed length, high germination potential.
[16:56.880 --> 16:59.880]  So let's go over to the second page of the handout.
[17:00.880 --> 17:07.880]  And there are already, AOSTA, which is the official certification agency for the U.S.,
[17:07.880 --> 17:12.880]  already has minimum established standards for what the seed lots are going to have to have.
[17:12.880 --> 17:15.880]  The first one you always think about is germination.
[17:15.880 --> 17:19.880]  So the minimum germination has to be 80% or higher.
[17:19.880 --> 17:23.880]  And then the other aspects are what we call purity.
[17:24.880 --> 17:40.860]  There's just broken seeds, other trash material, other crop seeds can be present, wheat seeds.
[17:40.860 --> 17:45.860]  Any of those would distract from having pure seed.
[17:45.860 --> 17:49.860]  So, and there are already thresholds established there.
[17:49.860 --> 17:53.860]  So what we're looking at here are those 23 seed lots.
[17:53.860 --> 17:57.860]  I've ranked those from high to low germination.
[17:57.860 --> 18:02.860]  And you can see we're all over the board as far as germination percentage.
[18:03.860 --> 18:07.860]  Those germinations, again, using 80% as the threshold,
[18:07.860 --> 18:15.860]  we only have a little over 50% of the seed lots would even pass certification standards to be planted in the U.S.
[18:16.860 --> 18:22.860]  Now I have a few other areas over here that are highlighted in red on the purity side.
[18:22.860 --> 18:30.860]  So again, the other crop seeds exceeds the certification standards, other wheat seeds that are present.
[18:31.860 --> 18:35.860]  So if we just took these seed lots as representative,
[18:35.860 --> 18:39.860]  we only have a little over 40% of the seed lots would even pass.
[18:39.860 --> 18:44.860]  So this industry, which is somewhat kind of an under-drowned industry,
[18:44.860 --> 18:51.860]  really needs to raise itself up just to put itself to make certification standards.
[18:51.860 --> 18:58.860]  So that's kind of one of my take-home lessons here is that the seed quality can be good looking.
[18:58.860 --> 19:00.860]  It does not have to be poor seed.
[19:00.860 --> 19:05.860]  And if you have other crop seeds, inert material, wheat seeds,
[19:05.860 --> 19:08.860]  that when you open up that bag of seeds when they're there,
[19:08.860 --> 19:15.860]  that is really something that seed companies can easily clean out with seed conditioning equipment.
[19:15.860 --> 19:25.860]  So we really need to have really improved seed lots to really improve the standards to help potential for this crop.
[19:25.860 --> 19:29.860]  So at this time I'll just open it up if anybody has questions.
[19:29.860 --> 19:33.860]  And I probably should have promised this because some of you are CBD people.
[19:34.860 --> 19:38.860]  All these varieties are for fiber or for grain.
[19:38.860 --> 19:44.860]  We've not done the testing aspect on the CBD variety because of limited seed versus fiber.
[19:44.860 --> 19:46.860]  I just wanted to preface that.
[19:46.860 --> 19:49.860]  That is another big issue.
[19:49.860 --> 19:51.860]  Yes, sir, you had a question?
[19:51.860 --> 19:53.860]  Yes.
[19:53.860 --> 19:55.860]  Yes.
[19:59.860 --> 20:01.860]  I'm sorry.
[20:08.540 --> 20:10.540]  Okay.
[20:10.540 --> 20:14.540]  So basically what are our standards that we use?
[20:14.540 --> 20:21.540]  So there is official standards for seed testing adopted by the acronym called the AOSA,
[20:21.540 --> 20:23.540]  the Association of Official Seed Analysts.
[20:23.540 --> 20:29.540]  It's the same type of criteria that our state seed testing laboratory would use in Albany as well as other states.
[20:29.540 --> 20:37.540]  So there are criteria as far as temperature in which the seeds are tested, the duration of the test, things like that.
[20:37.540 --> 20:44.540]  So we're really providing prescribed methods that we're following as far as what is germination.
[20:44.540 --> 20:48.540]  And the purity tests are done in these kinds of same sites.
[20:48.540 --> 20:51.540]  We can talk more about this if you have other questions.
[21:16.280 --> 21:18.280]  Good question.
[21:18.280 --> 21:24.280]  Zach was asking about we're really looking at maybe the future for next year about what seed treatment.
[21:24.280 --> 21:31.280]  So as far as what I would call an industrial crop for fiber or for grain,
[21:31.280 --> 21:37.280]  we may have for next season, as early as next season,
[21:37.280 --> 21:44.280]  and again that's very optimistic, that we have some of these materials that are already used on field crops.
[21:44.280 --> 21:47.280]  So it would be more of a seed treatment rather than a field.
[21:47.280 --> 21:50.280]  Don't think of like a seed pellet and things like that.
[21:50.280 --> 21:54.280]  We're really just looking at a small amount of the active material.
[21:54.280 --> 22:23.670]  We could use those where the chemical type seed treatments would be just for conventional type of production.
[22:23.670 --> 22:25.670]  Just the way it is in crops.
[22:25.670 --> 22:27.670]  But again, it's the timing.
[22:27.670 --> 22:32.670]  We've got to get the 2018 Farm Bill, it's going to have to go through where hemp is exempted.
[22:32.670 --> 22:34.670]  That will open things up.
[22:34.670 --> 22:40.670]  So again, what Gary and I are trying to strategize is try to be proactive.
[22:40.670 --> 22:42.670]  Kind of going on this year.
[22:42.670 --> 22:46.670]  What is feminized seed and how are they doing it? Why isn't it working?
[22:46.670 --> 22:51.670]  Right. For those of you involved in CBD production,
[22:51.670 --> 22:55.670]  you have an option.
[22:55.670 --> 22:58.670]  It depends on what the seed company is providing as feminized seeds.
[22:58.670 --> 23:00.670]  What are feminized seeds?
[23:00.670 --> 23:07.670]  Basically, you want to have the plants that you are producing only to produce flowers.
[23:07.670 --> 23:12.670]  You do not want to have those produce male flowers.
[23:12.670 --> 23:20.670]  Hemp seeds are naturally what we call dioecious means they have male plants and female plants.
[23:20.670 --> 23:25.670]  What we want for just the flower production, for the CBD production to be the highest,
[23:26.670 --> 23:30.670]  is those that only produce female flowers.
[23:30.670 --> 23:32.670]  So as we had talked about.
[23:32.670 --> 23:36.670]  So what the feminized seed part of that is,
[23:36.670 --> 23:43.670]  is a particular method that needs to be done during the seed production to produce those feminized seeds.
[23:43.670 --> 23:50.670]  Where you are using different materials, silver materials, things like that to change the sex expression.
[23:50.670 --> 23:57.670]  So basically, think of it in our own kind of our chromosomes with XX and XY.
[23:57.670 --> 24:05.670]  Hemp is the same type of a plant species with XX being female and XY being male.
[24:05.670 --> 24:12.670]  So basically, you need to have XX pollen to produce the seeds, to produce the feminized seeds.
[24:12.670 --> 24:14.670]  It is a rather specialized company.
[24:14.670 --> 24:16.670]  These seeds are extremely expensive.
[24:17.670 --> 24:20.670]  Those of you working in them can be a dollar or so per seed.
[24:20.670 --> 24:23.670]  So it is an expensive type of an operation.
[24:23.670 --> 24:30.670]  But one that you would have that high level of, very, very high level of female plants.
[24:30.670 --> 24:37.670]  The other way is if you do not have that or if the procedure is during seed production,
[24:37.670 --> 24:39.670]  still gives you some males.
[24:39.670 --> 24:44.670]  Those males are really going to have to be grossed out during the seed production time,
[24:44.670 --> 24:46.670]  during the crop production time.
[24:46.670 --> 24:50.670]  So you are not having that source of male pollen present there.
[24:50.670 --> 24:52.670]  Good question, John.
[24:52.670 --> 24:54.670]  Larry, you want to jump in here?
[24:54.670 --> 24:56.670]  We need to move on.
[24:56.670 --> 24:57.670]  Oh, yeah.
[24:57.670 --> 25:05.670]  I just want to say that some of the grant funding that we have from New York State is to facilitate certified seed production.
[25:06.670 --> 25:15.670]  Seeds are a big issue because federally, the DEA still considers it illegal to move live seeds across state lines.
[25:15.670 --> 25:20.670]  So that is a strong disincentive for companies to invest in seed production
[25:20.670 --> 25:25.670]  when it is federally illegal for them to sell across state lines.
[25:25.670 --> 25:32.670]  Now, the Omnibus Spending Act included language that said that the federal government
[25:32.670 --> 25:39.670]  could not expend any funds to intercept that movement, but the DEA still considers it illegal.
[25:39.670 --> 25:46.670]  So when companies are doing their due diligence, their lawyers tell them that.
[25:46.670 --> 25:55.670]  So it has been a challenge for us to work with seed companies to overcome that barrier.
[25:55.670 --> 26:02.670]  Let me also say that New York State is not necessarily the best environment for production of disease-free seeds.
[26:02.670 --> 26:10.670]  So when those restrictions are lifted, we may well see an intensification of seed production
[26:10.670 --> 26:15.670]  in those states that have optimum climate for producing disease-free seeds,
[26:15.670 --> 26:18.670]  mainly Oregon, Washington, Colorado.
[26:18.670 --> 26:23.670]  So that is another disincentive for New York seed companies to produce seed here.
[26:23.670 --> 26:30.670]  All that being said, we had a company committed to producing certified seed here in New York State.
[26:30.670 --> 26:32.670]  That was International Hemp Solutions.
[26:32.670 --> 26:38.670]  It was committed to produce certified seeds at the Albuquerque Seed, one of our best health departments in the last year.
[26:38.670 --> 26:45.670]  Unfortunately, it took us maybe more than eight weeks to get that.
[26:46.670 --> 26:58.480]  It took us two and a half months to get the seed imported from Poland.
[26:58.480 --> 27:02.480]  The first lot was contaminated and did not have a sanitary certificate.
[27:02.480 --> 27:06.480]  The second lot was coming right from the breeding institute in Poland.
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.480]  So that seed is now sitting in our freezer here and is ready for next year.
[27:11.480 --> 27:18.480]  So next year we should have production certified here in New York State.
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.800]  So the question is, are there companies that are producing seed in New York State?
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.800]  No, there are no companies right now producing seed within New York State.
[27:34.800 --> 27:42.800]  New York State Ag and Markets has adopted the AOSCA seed certification standards.
[27:42.800 --> 27:45.800]  That's the American Organization of Seed Certifying Agencies.
[27:45.800 --> 27:52.800]  So we now have a framework for certifying seed and putting a label on hemp seed.
[27:52.800 --> 27:57.800]  By next year we will have certified seed production in New York State.
[27:57.800 --> 28:00.800]  Do you have a requirement to use certified seed?
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.800]  There is not a requirement to use certified seed.
[28:05.800 --> 28:08.800]  So, one more quick question.
[28:08.800 --> 28:20.090]  Are you using medical marijuana or is there a marijuana machine?
[28:20.090 --> 28:23.090]  So at Cornell University we do not work on marijuana.
[28:23.090 --> 28:26.090]  So no, we are not working with a medical marijuana company.
[28:27.090 --> 28:30.090]  I'm going to pass it off to Tim Sweeney.
[28:30.090 --> 28:37.090]  He can answer some of your questions and give an overview of the current status of the pilot program in New York.
[28:37.090 --> 28:43.940]  Thanks for coming. My name is Tim Sweeney. I'm a policy analyst at Ag and Markets.
[28:43.940 --> 28:47.940]  I have the privilege of overseeing much of the Hemp Program.
[28:47.940 --> 28:53.940]  Just out of curiosity, how many here are not currently involved in the program but hope to apply?
[28:54.940 --> 28:58.940]  I don't think I need to run through the entire process.
[28:58.940 --> 29:02.940]  If you all want to come up and talk to me afterward, I can give you the broader view.
[29:02.940 --> 29:06.940]  I'll just do a quick synopsis right now.
[29:06.940 --> 29:13.940]  As was mentioned previously, we have about 3,200 acres that could be planted in New York State.
[29:13.940 --> 29:18.940]  Approved for planting. If everyone that is approved, plant it to the extent that they apply for.
[29:18.940 --> 29:20.940]  We have about 3,200 acres.
[29:20.940 --> 29:29.940]  We have 136, I believe, growers, research partners registered with us, authorized by us, and 28 processors.
[29:29.940 --> 29:37.940]  We continue to take applications on a rolling basis for people that are interested in growing for food and fiber.
[29:37.940 --> 29:44.940]  We are not, however, able to take any applications with regard to CPD.
[29:44.940 --> 29:53.940]  Because this is a research project, we have a lot of CPD applications come in in the past.
[29:53.940 --> 29:56.940]  In the first few years, this year particularly.
[29:56.940 --> 30:03.940]  We have stopped taking CPD applications to allow us to get a handle on the CPD world
[30:03.940 --> 30:10.940]  and to better establish guidelines for regulating CPD.
[30:11.940 --> 30:17.940]  We are still taking applications for growers.
[30:17.940 --> 30:23.940]  However, given the lateness of the season, it would probably be advisable if you wanted to apply for the permit
[30:23.940 --> 30:27.940]  to wait until later in the year and apply.
[30:27.940 --> 30:31.940]  Because it is a three year permit, so you wouldn't want to waste the first year of it
[30:31.940 --> 30:34.940]  and not be able to get anything in the ground this year.
[30:34.940 --> 30:38.940]  With regard to getting seed, as many of you might know,
[30:38.940 --> 30:42.940]  if you want to get seed from an international source, you have to come through us.
[30:42.940 --> 30:44.940]  We hold the DEA import permit.
[30:44.940 --> 30:46.940]  You would submit your request through us.
[30:46.940 --> 30:48.940]  You make all the arrangements with your seed company.
[30:48.940 --> 30:50.940]  You submit a request to us.
[30:50.940 --> 30:52.940]  We then file the DEA paperwork.
[30:52.940 --> 30:54.940]  They send us the import permits.
[30:54.940 --> 30:56.940]  We then give them to you.
[30:56.940 --> 30:58.940]  You give them to the seed company.
[30:58.940 --> 31:00.940]  And your seed has to come to Albany.
[31:00.940 --> 31:03.940]  We have to take possession of it.
[31:03.940 --> 31:05.940]  You have to come pick it up in Albany.
[31:05.940 --> 31:07.940]  We try to get around this.
[31:07.940 --> 31:11.940]  We ask the DEA to allow us to meet shipments at farms.
[31:11.940 --> 31:13.940]  And we got a big deal.
[31:13.940 --> 31:18.940]  So, that just is the way it is for now.
[31:18.940 --> 31:22.940]  As also was mentioned earlier, there is pending federal legislation,
[31:22.940 --> 31:24.940]  federal farm bill.
[31:24.940 --> 31:27.940]  If the farm bill passes, and this is a big if,
[31:27.940 --> 31:30.940]  with the language that's included in the Senate version,
[31:30.940 --> 31:33.940]  this program is likely to change quite a bit
[31:33.940 --> 31:38.940]  in that we may not be required to make you submit a research question to us.
[31:38.940 --> 31:40.940]  It would take it out of the realm of research.
[31:40.940 --> 31:44.940]  It would treat it more like a regular agricultural crop.
[31:44.940 --> 31:47.940]  However, you would still have to come through us.
[31:47.940 --> 31:49.940]  We will still be regulated.
[31:49.940 --> 31:51.940]  In fact, if the law passes that's it,
[31:51.940 --> 31:56.940]  we will have to submit our program to the federal government for their approval.
[31:56.940 --> 32:01.940]  And then we would be running it under the guidelines that are approved by the federal government.
[32:01.940 --> 32:06.940]  So, there are still some changes to be made in the future, we think,
[32:06.940 --> 32:09.940]  with regard to how the program is run.
[32:09.940 --> 32:15.940]  Perhaps it will require less on your part with regard to coming up with a research program,
[32:15.940 --> 32:17.940]  but it will still be regulated.
[32:17.940 --> 32:19.940]  You will still likely have to come out and test
[32:19.940 --> 32:25.940]  to ensure that the THC levels are within the definition of industrial hemp.
[32:25.940 --> 32:30.940]  Having said all that, I know that usually whenever I'm at one of these events,
[32:30.940 --> 32:33.940]  I get lots of questions that can take up lots of time.
[32:33.940 --> 32:37.940]  So, I don't want to bore you with more stuff about the process.
[32:37.940 --> 32:39.940]  I can just take questions now if you like.
[32:39.940 --> 32:47.960]  Is there a fixed rate for CBD licenses right now?
[32:47.960 --> 32:51.960]  Okay, the question is, is there a fixed rate for CBD licenses right now?
[32:51.960 --> 32:52.960]  There is not a fixed rate.
[32:52.960 --> 32:54.960]  We've just not been able to take it.
[32:54.960 --> 32:57.960]  A decision was made that we're not going to take any more until time being.
[32:57.960 --> 33:02.960]  We expect that sometime in the future that we will begin taking CBD applications again.
[33:02.960 --> 33:05.960]  However, we're not sure when that will be.
[33:05.960 --> 33:07.960]  How far in the future?
[33:07.960 --> 33:08.960]  We don't know.
[33:08.960 --> 33:11.960]  So, it could be years?
[33:11.960 --> 33:15.960]  I don't think it would be years, but we don't know.
[33:15.960 --> 33:18.960]  I have a question for you.
[33:18.960 --> 33:23.960]  Do you know about regulations for CBD going across state lines?
[33:23.960 --> 33:29.320]  Is there a food product?
[33:29.320 --> 33:33.040]  I do not know the rules.
[33:34.040 --> 33:43.040]  The question was, do I know the regulations with regard to shipping CBD over state lines in tincture form or other products like that?
[33:43.040 --> 33:50.040]  This is where some of the issue lies with regard to CBD production and the question of legality.
[33:50.040 --> 33:54.040]  We always advise people that they need to get a good lawyer.
[33:54.040 --> 33:56.040]  A lawyer that works on cannabis issues.
[33:56.040 --> 33:59.040]  This environment is changing rapidly.
[34:00.040 --> 34:08.040]  The FDA recently approved a drug called Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures in epileptic children.
[34:08.040 --> 34:17.040]  CBD is a major component of that, which now means that CBD perhaps will be looked at differently by the federal government.
[34:17.040 --> 34:24.040]  We need to see what the federal government is going to do with regard to regulation of CBD.
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.040]  Any insight into the processing grant?
[34:30.040 --> 34:33.040]  Did you close down that grant at any time?
[34:33.040 --> 34:36.040]  The processing grant program is run through Empire State Development.
[34:36.040 --> 34:38.040]  It's a different agency.
[34:38.040 --> 34:43.040]  I do know that they did stop taking the applications for the time being.
[34:43.040 --> 34:50.040]  I'm not sure when or if that will open up, but I think once again, it was because many of those applications were related to CBD.
[34:50.040 --> 34:53.040]  We need to get a better handle on CBD.
[34:54.040 --> 34:58.040]  How many of the 3,600 acres are you planning to plant?
[34:58.040 --> 35:03.040]  We haven't yet got a... It would be out of 3,200 or so.
[35:03.040 --> 35:06.040]  We're not yet sure how many we're planning.
[35:06.040 --> 35:12.040]  We're in the process of having our horticulture inspectors go out to ground truth what actually was planted.
[35:12.040 --> 35:18.040]  Then, of course, they'll be back out at harvest time to take the samples that need to be tested at our lab.
[35:19.040 --> 35:23.040]  Do you have any notion of the cost?
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.040]  How much is the space, the field space versus the greenhouse space?
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.040]  I don't know off the top of my head.
[35:32.040 --> 35:35.040]  The vast majority is field.
[35:35.040 --> 35:38.040]  How is it that they sell CBD flowers?
[35:38.040 --> 35:43.620]  That's an excellent question.
[35:43.620 --> 35:47.620]  The question was how do they sell CBD flowers in a store in Geneva.
[35:48.620 --> 35:51.620]  That is not within our program.
[35:51.620 --> 35:53.620]  That's not within our purview.
[35:53.620 --> 36:01.620]  That is a function of the lack of clarity with regard to the laws covering CBD and other crops.
[36:01.620 --> 36:04.620]  Lack of resources for abortion.
[36:04.620 --> 36:06.620]  Go ahead.
[36:06.620 --> 36:10.620]  Can you talk more about how the state program will change with regard to the farm?
[36:10.620 --> 36:17.400]  The question was can I talk more about how the state program will change if the farm bill passes.
[36:18.400 --> 36:24.400]  It will require that we will submit our program to the federal government for their approval.
[36:24.400 --> 36:36.400]  It would also take industrial hemp out of the world of controlled substance, which would make it less highly regulated on the federal side.
[36:36.400 --> 36:44.400]  It would still require us to do sampling and testing to ensure that the THC levels were within the definition.
[36:45.400 --> 36:52.400]  If it stays as it is, there would no longer be a requirement that it be a research project.
[36:52.400 --> 36:57.400]  The restrictions with regard to commercialization would no longer be there.
[36:57.400 --> 37:04.400]  Right now, true commercialization of the product according to federal law is not allowed.
[37:04.400 --> 37:08.400]  The state would still issue a permit to grow it possibly.
[37:08.400 --> 37:10.400]  That's my understanding.
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.400]  We would still have to have a handle on it because we would still have to know where everything is growing.
[37:14.400 --> 37:17.400]  We would need to sample and test it.
[37:17.400 --> 37:22.400]  Are the research licenses going to be renewable?
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.400]  The question is are the research licenses renewable.
[37:25.400 --> 37:29.400]  The research authorization is good for three years.
[37:29.400 --> 37:31.400]  It's a $500 permit fee.
[37:31.400 --> 37:38.400]  If your research project is not completed at the end of the three years, you can apply to us for an extension.
[37:38.400 --> 37:41.400]  We haven't yet had that happen because we haven't had this for three years.
[37:41.400 --> 37:48.400]  Would that $500 fee have to stay the same if the 2018 Farm Bill is approved?
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.400]  The question is would the $500 fee remain the same if the Farm Bill passes?
[37:53.400 --> 37:55.400]  I don't know the answer to that.
[37:55.400 --> 38:05.640]  The question is if the Farm Bill does not pass, would we cease what we're doing now?
[38:05.640 --> 38:07.640]  I don't think so.
[38:07.640 --> 38:11.640]  I think that we are pretty well on the road to being an industrialized state.
[38:11.640 --> 38:15.640]  I believe that we would continue to work under the current Farm Bill.
[38:15.640 --> 38:21.640]  Is there a possibility that the Farm Bill would be reintegrated?
[38:21.640 --> 38:24.640]  That's a tough question. That would be my best guess.
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.640]  Let's assume there would be a continuation of the existing Farm Bill.
[38:27.640 --> 38:33.640]  If marijuana is legalized in the United States, how would that affect the United States?
[38:33.640 --> 38:37.640]  The question is if marijuana is legalized in the state, how would that affect the United States?
[38:37.640 --> 38:43.640]  The programs would be two very distinct and discrete operations.
[38:43.640 --> 38:51.640]  There has been a work group formed by the Governor's Office to address the development of an adult-use marijuana program.
[38:51.640 --> 38:55.640]  We're not sure where there may be overlap.
[38:55.640 --> 38:58.640]  There may be some in the CBD world.
[38:58.640 --> 39:00.640]  We don't know yet.
[39:00.640 --> 39:04.640]  I think that work group is meeting today for the first time, actually.
[39:04.640 --> 39:07.640]  So we're very much in the formative stages there.
[39:08.640 --> 39:26.130]  The question is are we still checking THC level if the crop is being grown for 500 grams?
[39:26.130 --> 39:30.130]  Yes, we are, because the potential is there that it could go above.
[39:30.130 --> 39:42.910]  It would be grown next year for the 2020 growing season.
[39:42.910 --> 39:45.910]  Okay. Let's say that happens in the United States.
[39:45.910 --> 39:57.540]  That is close. We'll have to see.
[39:58.540 --> 40:04.540]  But if you were able to buy it in New York, would it still have to be picked up in Albany?
[40:04.540 --> 40:11.540]  No. The question is if seed was purchased in New York State, would it still have to be picked up at our office in Albany?
[40:11.540 --> 40:18.540]  The only time that anyone needs to come to get their seed in Albany is if it's seed that's been imported from another country,
[40:18.540 --> 40:21.540]  pursuant to our DEA import permit.
[40:21.540 --> 40:23.540]  And that's just the way it is.
[40:24.540 --> 40:26.540]  Exactly.
[40:26.540 --> 40:30.840]  At your own risk.
[40:30.840 --> 40:37.840]  At your own risk. Because there is some gray area with regard to federal law and various local enforcement authorities
[40:37.840 --> 40:41.840]  that you may meet along the way on your trip to Colorado, to Long Island.
[40:41.840 --> 40:44.840]  There is some risk.
[40:44.840 --> 40:50.840]  So when I mentioned that it is illegal to move across state lines,
[40:51.840 --> 40:56.840]  but that federal agencies could not expend money to intercept that,
[40:56.840 --> 41:05.710]  that does not preclude local law enforcement agencies from spending money to intercept that.
[41:05.710 --> 41:08.710]  Anyone else? I've been ignoring this side.
[41:08.710 --> 41:10.710]  Pardon me.
[41:15.710 --> 41:22.040]  This is an area that, if you're growing for CBD,
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.040]  and you've done your extraction process, well you've grown your CBD crop,
[41:26.040 --> 41:31.040]  it's sampled by our inspectors and tested by our lab and it's within the 0.3%,
[41:31.040 --> 41:37.040]  but then through the extraction process, you come out with a product that is above the 0.3%.
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.040]  Is that then something that needs to be destroyed or can it be diluted?
[41:42.040 --> 41:44.040]  That is an excellent question.
[41:44.040 --> 41:47.040]  And it is something that we are still trying to get a handle on,
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.040]  and it is part of the reason why we are no longer at this point taking a CBD application.
[41:52.040 --> 42:01.040]  Because if it's above 0.3 THC, you're not within the parameters of the industrial hemp program.
[42:01.040 --> 42:06.040]  New York, but Vermont, I think they are at 1%.
[42:06.040 --> 42:10.040]  Well, Vermont may be at 1%, but they might have gone rogue a little bit.
[42:10.040 --> 42:16.040]  We are held to the standard established by the federal law and the state law.
[42:16.040 --> 42:24.040]  So there are other states that are taking a different approach, but we're here and we have to do what we're told.
[42:24.040 --> 42:31.040]  Do you have any numbers on what percentage is for industrial hemp?
[42:31.040 --> 42:33.040]  How many acres?
[42:33.040 --> 42:42.150]  The question is do I know how many acres out of the 3,200 are dedicated to CBD.
[42:42.150 --> 42:52.150]  I don't know the number of acres, but I know that out of the first 100 applications we got this growing season, 50 of them were CBD.
[42:52.150 --> 42:54.150]  So it was 50% at that time.
[42:54.150 --> 43:04.150]  We have been taking food and fiber applications continuously, but it's a high percentage that are dedicated to CBD.
[43:05.150 --> 43:13.150]  I'm just curious, I know a lot of people are interested in CBD, but some folks are doing very large scale.
[43:13.150 --> 43:37.860]  The question is, is there a taxation element to the growing or the producing of the CBD products or any of the industrial hemp?
[43:37.860 --> 43:41.860]  No, there isn't. We do not have anything like that.
[43:41.860 --> 43:49.860]  Our agencies, we're strictly the ag side of things, but there are no special tax programs associated with the program.
[43:49.860 --> 44:11.640]  A friend of mine in the medical marijuana industry has talked about it, but the same folks are doing it.
[44:11.640 --> 44:15.970]  Do you have any ruling on how to do that?
[44:15.970 --> 44:29.970]  The question is, from a grower perspective, can you optimize production of CBD while maintaining legal limits on THC?
[44:29.970 --> 44:35.970]  That's an excellent question. Stress can induce that pathway.
[44:36.970 --> 44:48.970]  We don't have a lot of experience here at Cornell in studying that, but we do have two trials now underway to start to quantify CBD and THC production across a range of different health departments.
[44:48.970 --> 44:52.970]  Chris Mark will be talking about that.
[44:52.970 --> 44:58.970]  Also, the developmental stage is critical.
[44:58.970 --> 45:01.970]  Cross-stress can induce THC.
[45:01.970 --> 45:05.970]  All of these things are critical questions to address.
[45:05.970 --> 45:14.970]  All of these require quick turnaround testing labs, which we also do not have at New York State.
[45:14.970 --> 45:21.970]  There is a regulatory testing that will be done in the food lab at Ag and Markets,
[45:21.970 --> 45:31.970]  but many of you growers want quick turnaround testing for THC in the middle of the season so you can judge when you should harvest so you don't go home.
[45:31.970 --> 45:36.970]  There is an urgent need for more reliable testing labs in this state.
[45:36.970 --> 45:40.970]  I just have one more question for Tim, and then we're going to move on.
[45:41.970 --> 45:50.970]  Are you accepting applications for affiliated growers for CBD production from existing license holders?
[45:50.970 --> 45:52.970]  No affiliation.
[45:52.970 --> 45:54.970]  No affiliated growers either.
[45:54.970 --> 45:58.970]  So existing CBD license holders cannot expand.
[45:58.970 --> 46:02.970]  Just a quick question.
[46:06.520 --> 46:09.520]  I just want to thank Tim again.
[46:09.520 --> 46:15.520]  This has been an incredible partnership and collaboration with Ag and Markets and the legislature.
[46:15.520 --> 46:23.520]  Ag and Markets has never turned down a request that I know of to come and speak to a public group like this.
[46:23.520 --> 46:34.520]  They have been very open in working with us, wanting to develop a program based on the science,
[46:34.520 --> 46:39.520]  which I highly respect and, of course, we're grateful for their research funding.
[46:39.520 --> 46:41.520]  So thanks, Tim.
[46:41.520 --> 46:54.380]  So a lot of those questions that folks were asking are very challenging in our current legal landscape.
[46:54.380 --> 47:04.380]  I serve on the Industrial Hemp Working Group, convened by the Commissioner of Agriculture, Mike Barnhart, who is here, also serves on that.
[47:05.380 --> 47:14.380]  I'm not sure if there are other folks here on the working group, but when the governor accepted the report from the Commissioner of Health
[47:14.380 --> 47:26.380]  for proposing adult-use marijuana here and decriminalization of marijuana,
[47:26.380 --> 47:32.380]  that poses particular challenges for the industrial hemp industry.
[47:32.380 --> 47:40.380]  So if you're growing for CBD in particular, if your plants go hot, they're considered marijuana.
[47:40.380 --> 47:46.380]  So perhaps we'll be better off, if you're a CBD producer, getting a marijuana grower's license.
[47:46.380 --> 47:53.380]  But we don't know what that program will look like, whether we will have outdoor marijuana production,
[47:53.380 --> 48:01.380]  and how that will interact with our existing medical marijuana program.
[48:01.380 --> 48:08.380]  So those are very challenging questions, and again, the state has been very prudent in rolling out these programs,
[48:08.380 --> 48:15.380]  and I believe that they're doing it again by putting the brakes on the CBD production right now
[48:15.380 --> 48:21.380]  until we can work out the gold standard for regulation here at the University.
[48:21.380 --> 48:23.380]  So we're going to move on.
[48:23.380 --> 48:30.380]  Jamie Crawford from the Delafines Program is going to talk about our cultivar trials.
[48:41.260 --> 48:51.260]  Hi there. So this year we had 32 entries in our trials, while last year we had 17, so almost a double.
[48:51.260 --> 48:58.260]  That's pretty exciting. Hopefully it doesn't double again, because I don't know if we can really handle that many entries.
[48:59.260 --> 49:05.260]  But if any of you folks are growing varieties that you don't see on this list, please let us know,
[49:05.260 --> 49:13.260]  because I would be really interested to know if there are green or fiber varieties in New York this year that we haven't been testing.
[49:13.260 --> 49:15.260]  It would be really interesting.
[49:15.260 --> 49:26.260]  So from these lists you can see we've got varieties from Canada, from Serbia, from the Ukraine, from Italy, from Poland,
[49:26.260 --> 49:31.260]  also some from Oregon. Things develop.
[49:31.260 --> 49:44.260]  Some entries are pretty interesting. When the market started to expand, there was sort of a variety grab of European varieties.
[49:44.260 --> 49:50.260]  So United States companies have been buying up exclusive rights to a lot of European types.
[49:51.260 --> 49:55.260]  So one thing that we do have in our trials is Pygra.
[49:55.260 --> 50:02.260]  So we have a seed lot of Pygra that we purchased last year that we saved some seed from, and that was produced in Poland.
[50:02.260 --> 50:07.260]  And then we have Pygra that was produced in Kentucky, last growing seed.
[50:07.260 --> 50:09.260]  So we're going to have those two next to each other.
[50:09.260 --> 50:17.260]  And it will be really interesting to see what the differences are, if any, just because of where the seed was grown.
[50:18.260 --> 50:24.260]  So we divided all of our entries up into three trials this year.
[50:24.260 --> 50:27.260]  So we have a fiber trial. That's pretty straightforward.
[50:27.260 --> 50:32.260]  But then we have a grain cultivar trial, and then one we're calling dual purpose.
[50:32.260 --> 50:38.260]  And those were divided by time to maturity.
[50:38.260 --> 50:49.260]  So based on the information given to us from the seed companies, anything that was 110 days to maturity or less went into the grain trial.
[50:49.260 --> 50:54.260]  And then more than 110 days went into the dual purpose trial.
[50:54.260 --> 51:07.260]  I'm so sad that you guys aren't able to see the variety trials, because I think that really highlights the importance of regional testing for the varieties.
[51:07.260 --> 51:13.260]  Because we have two varieties in our grain trial that are not flowering yet.
[51:13.260 --> 51:18.260]  Everything else is about knee height and starting to set seeds.
[51:18.260 --> 51:22.260]  And those two varieties are still not flowering.
[51:22.260 --> 51:31.260]  And then in our dual purpose trial, we have three or four varieties that are also starting to set seeds.
[51:32.260 --> 51:37.260]  And that was all just based on information given to us from the seed companies.
[51:37.260 --> 51:43.260]  So that just highlights how important the regional testing is.
[51:43.260 --> 51:48.260]  So this year we've got six different locations for our trials.
[51:48.260 --> 51:51.260]  So on the front you guys can see the map.
[51:51.260 --> 51:58.260]  We're growing some of the trial in Long Island this year, so we'll have some good information for that.
[51:59.260 --> 52:06.260]  We also have two locations here in Geneva, one in Ithaca, and then one on our organic pre-built farm.
[52:06.260 --> 52:11.260]  So for all the organic growers, we hope to be able to provide some good information about that this year.
[52:11.260 --> 52:19.260]  And then the last trial is in Chez Vides, so just about as far north as you can get and still be in New York State.
[52:19.260 --> 52:23.260]  So that'll be some good information too.
[52:24.260 --> 52:32.260]  People that we've worked with in Canada have told us that varieties that are eight feet tall in Canada are only three feet tall here.
[52:32.260 --> 52:39.260]  So maybe we'll get a little bit more height in our Chesey trial than we do here or in location.
[52:42.260 --> 52:49.260]  So our first trial we planted last year was in... we planted it June 9th.
[52:49.260 --> 52:52.260]  June 9th was our first trial last year.
[52:53.260 --> 52:57.260]  It was exceptional. It was an exceptional planting.
[52:57.260 --> 53:04.260]  This year, everything that we planted was within two weeks of that date.
[53:04.260 --> 53:11.260]  But the establishment wasn't... I mean you guys know, right? It was dry.
[53:11.260 --> 53:16.260]  We had a dry June and a dry early July here.
[53:17.260 --> 53:19.260]  And we went and we took notes.
[53:19.260 --> 53:25.260]  And just comparing this year's data to last year's, we had... it's two feet.
[53:25.260 --> 53:32.260]  In Ithaca, our trial is planted in the field directly next door to the one we planted last year.
[53:32.260 --> 53:34.260]  So everything should be the same.
[53:34.260 --> 53:40.260]  It was planted four days later, but you wouldn't think that would have that much of an impact.
[53:40.260 --> 53:47.260]  But the height on average, the trial is two feet shorter this year than last year.
[53:47.260 --> 53:52.260]  And that's because we've had half the rain that we've had last year.
[53:52.260 --> 53:58.260]  So in the first month, so the first four weeks after planting, we had less than two inches in Ithaca.
[53:58.260 --> 54:01.260]  And last year we had closer to five inches.
[54:01.260 --> 54:04.260]  So it was a really big difference.
[54:05.260 --> 54:08.260]  So I brought a plant.
[54:14.260 --> 54:18.260]  So this is a plant from our fiber trial last year.
[54:18.260 --> 54:22.260]  And it was actually taller. You can see the top of it broke off.
[54:22.260 --> 54:26.260]  We're not going to get fiber yields like that this year.
[54:26.260 --> 54:30.260]  It's just not going to happen because everything is so much shorter.
[54:31.260 --> 54:37.260]  I have confidence that our grain yields could still be very good.
[54:37.260 --> 54:40.260]  The plot's filled in nicely.
[54:40.260 --> 54:44.260]  But our fiber, because of the drought, is going to be...
[54:44.260 --> 54:48.260]  Right now the plants are about as tall as me.
[54:48.260 --> 54:52.260]  But I don't think... and they're starting to flower.
[54:52.260 --> 54:56.260]  So they're not going to get to be like this this year.
[54:57.260 --> 55:04.260]  So one more thing I wanted to mention is the seed cost.
[55:04.260 --> 55:07.260]  So we're testing 32 varieties.
[55:07.260 --> 55:14.260]  And some of them cost just under $3 a pound when you include shipping fees.
[55:14.260 --> 55:19.260]  And some of them are over $30 a pound when you include shipping fees.
[55:19.260 --> 55:25.260]  So when we're just buying enough for our trials, that may not be enough.
[55:25.260 --> 55:27.260]  That may not be a big deal.
[55:27.260 --> 55:32.260]  But I'm sure when you folks are planting many, many acres of it,
[55:32.260 --> 55:35.260]  that would add up really quickly.
[55:35.260 --> 55:40.260]  So I know there's people doing economic analysis of that as well.
[55:40.260 --> 55:42.260]  And we hope to provide that to you all as well.
[55:42.260 --> 55:46.260]  So you can see, maybe you get a little bit of a yield bump with something
[55:46.260 --> 55:49.260]  that you're paying $32 a pound for.
[55:49.260 --> 55:54.260]  But if it's not... if you're not getting the yield,
[55:54.260 --> 55:57.260]  if it doesn't make up that initial seed cost,
[55:57.260 --> 56:00.260]  that would be very important to know.
[56:03.660 --> 56:05.660]  Harvest is coming.
[56:05.660 --> 56:08.660]  So we don't have any information about that for this year.
[56:08.660 --> 56:10.660]  But it's coming soon.
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.080]  So we are recording the maturity at different times throughout the year.
[56:40.080 --> 56:45.080]  So we should be able to report on flowering times for each of the different varieties.
[56:47.080 --> 56:53.080]  So what I was saying is that what we are noticing is differences in our trials
[56:53.080 --> 56:55.080]  than what was in the company information.
[56:55.080 --> 56:59.080]  So we don't have that from one year to the next.
[56:59.080 --> 57:03.080]  But we do have that for this... we'll have that for this year.
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.080]  And the flowering time, because we're covering almost 2 degrees latitude,
[57:09.080 --> 57:13.080]  the flowering time is taking different amounts of time than it is in January.
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.080]  I'm just curious, with the fiber, how much growth you saw after starting the flower last year?
[57:19.080 --> 57:21.080]  Was it a significant or...
[57:21.080 --> 57:22.080]  No.
[57:22.080 --> 57:23.080]  Did it basically stop?
[57:23.080 --> 57:27.080]  It didn't stop, but it...
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.080]  So from that point on, it's just the flowering that had big growth.
[57:32.080 --> 57:38.080]  So the part that would snap off easily and would not be really useful for the fiber.
[57:41.630 --> 57:43.630]  And we harvested pretty quickly after that.
[57:44.630 --> 58:00.850]  Other questions?
[58:01.850 --> 58:03.850]  Have you done any reading trials?
[58:06.320 --> 58:07.320]  Can you repeat the question?
[58:07.320 --> 58:10.320]  His question was, have we done any reading trials?
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.320]  We attempted to read some of our material in Ithaca last year,
[58:15.320 --> 58:18.320]  and it's a learning process, I'll say.
[58:19.320 --> 58:22.320]  We did take stems out of each plot,
[58:22.320 --> 58:28.320]  and we made little humidity things in the greenhouse to set a plastic bag,
[58:28.320 --> 58:31.320]  so we kept spraying to get it to spread that way.
[58:31.320 --> 58:35.320]  So we do have some of that information, just on a few stems from each plot.
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.320]  But the field reading is...
[58:38.320 --> 58:44.320]  I think it's an art, and it's going to take some practice.
[58:46.320 --> 58:51.320]  So this year for our fiber trials, we're working with Dr. Jared Nelson at SUNY New Paltz.
[58:52.320 --> 58:55.320]  Together with Jen Gilbert-Jenkins at Morris Post State College.
[58:56.320 --> 59:02.320]  So together the three of us have defined reading protocols that we're going to use for our fiber trials.
[59:03.320 --> 59:07.320]  So we will field read all of our fiber this year,
[59:07.320 --> 59:12.320]  determine a weight of straw, which we didn't do last year for each plot,
[59:12.320 --> 59:17.320]  and then share some of that material with Jared to do mechanical analysis on the fiber.
[59:18.320 --> 59:21.320]  And we'd be happy to share materials.
[59:21.320 --> 59:23.320]  Another post-analyst.
[59:25.970 --> 59:31.970]  Last year we gave all of our border rows to a gentleman who actually has his own pitch.
[59:31.970 --> 59:36.970]  And so he water-readed it, and he sent us some of the information that he received.
[59:36.970 --> 59:39.970]  But I think it was his first time trying it too.
[59:39.970 --> 59:42.970]  So it's very interesting.
[59:44.970 --> 59:47.970]  Did you publish a great deal of numbers from your trials last year?
[59:54.150 --> 59:58.150]  I do believe that it is public. I'm not sure if it's on our website though.
[59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.150]  But we think it's on our website.
[01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:04.150]  He asked if we had published our great deal from last year.
[01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:07.150]  It's not in a peer-reviewed publication yet.
[01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:14.150]  Most of those agronomy journals require two years of data to publish it in a peer-reviewed journal.
[01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:18.150]  So I believe we're waiting to get this year's data.
[01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:22.150]  But we do have tables, certainly of graphs.
[01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:28.150]  So you can see the ranges of yields in the different locations based on different planting times.
[01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:29.150]  Is that on your website?
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.150]  If it's not, we'll get it up.
[01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.150]  We'll make sure it's there.
[01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:34.150]  Or I'd be happy to email it to you directly.
[01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:38.150]  Last year there was huge variation depending on location.
[01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:45.150]  Some locations were just around 600 pounds per acre were the yields.
[01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:46.150]  So pretty low.
[01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:49.150]  Those were things that had poor establishment.
[01:00:50.150 --> 01:01:02.490]  For this year or for both of you, it's quite a range across different sites.
[01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:04.490]  And drainage classes as well.
[01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:11.490]  The drainage classes and the soil types were definitely on the handout from last year.
[01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.490]  So those are on the website.
[01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:20.490]  If you have seven seed plantings, we can certainly add those to this year's for you guys.
[01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:23.490]  Thank you, Jamie.
[01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:32.810]  Jamie is the one who acquires all of our seed for us.
[01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.810]  That is a real challenge.
[01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:39.810]  Our plantings went in probably ten days later than we would have liked.
[01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:44.810]  Again, because we're waiting for fiber seed to come from Italy.
[01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.810]  So that has been a real challenge.
[01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:53.810]  My number one piece of advice for all of you here is order your seed early.
[01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.810]  Try to get it in by February.
[01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.810]  Even from Canada.
[01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:59.810]  Kenan Stone is here from UDC.
[01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:06.810]  The delays in getting seed from Canada into the U.S. seem to be even worse this year.
[01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.810]  So order your seed early.
[01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:16.810]  So Matt Chartrand from Elson Shields Group is going to talk about some of the sampling he's been doing
[01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:18.810]  for insect pests.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.350]  Hello, my name is Matt.
[01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:32.350]  He's not here today.
[01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:34.350]  He has other stuff going on.
[01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:40.350]  I've been working to survey the insect pests throughout the industrial hemp fields.
[01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:43.350]  I think the best way to show you guys is this brochure here.
[01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:47.350]  If you don't have one, there's a couple more up on the table.
[01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:51.350]  Basically, this whole summer what I've been doing is going out to various farms.
[01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:59.350]  I've been to 10 different counties so far this season to sweep for insects and kind of get an idea of what's actually out there in the fields.
[01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:03.350]  What may become an issue for growers in the summer.
[01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:10.350]  So on the center three panels here, you'll see there's three different insect pests that I highlighted.
[01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:13.350]  The first on the left is the Tarnished Plant Bug.
[01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:18.350]  And that is by far the highest population pest we've seen in the field so far.
[01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:24.350]  There's a little bit of information there. I won't take too long to bore you with the feeding styles.
[01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:31.350]  If you want to learn more about the Tarnished Plant Bug, there's a little bit up there and an example of the feeding below.
[01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:35.350]  And then on the center panel here we have the European Corn Borer.
[01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:40.350]  I've only seen this in one trial actually, and that was down in Orange County.
[01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:44.350]  That was the most devastating insect I've seen so far.
[01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:51.350]  It only went after two plants, but it bore into the stem of the plant resulting in death of the entire plant.
[01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:55.350]  And so that grower had to take out those two CBD varieties.
[01:03:55.350 --> 01:04:04.350]  So as you can see, and as Gary was talking about earlier, the disease and insects are going to be like a working document basically.
[01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:10.350]  So if the farmer has seen something, take a picture or collect it and feel free to send it along to me.
[01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:16.350]  My email is on this brochure. Or just collect it and send an actual physical sample to the farmer.
[01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:20.350]  So that's how we heard about the European Corn Borer.
[01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:25.350]  And then also we got the Flea Beetles, which seem to be in pretty high population as well.
[01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:28.350]  That's the far right panel in the center.
[01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:31.350]  And the Flea Beetles basically are vegetative feeders.
[01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:38.350]  They go after the leaves, get those pinhole kind of feeding sides, put it in here.
[01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:47.350]  And so not necessarily something that's going to be harming your yield in the long run, but something to keep an eye on for years to come.
[01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:51.350]  And then on this center fold in here we have the Japanese Beetle.
[01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:58.350]  So if you're a grower around here, which many of you are out here, you know that we have a lot of Japanese Beetles in this area.
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:02.350]  So the good news is I haven't seen it go after too many plants.
[01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:07.350]  But that one example below is an example of what they can do.
[01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:14.350]  So it may be something to keep in mind for the future years of growing if you see a high Japanese Beetle population.
[01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:18.350]  Traps or other ways to combat that very well.
[01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:21.350]  And then one last thing I just wanted to mention.
[01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:24.350]  This whole project has been based on insect pests.
[01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:27.350]  So insects that are actually harming the plant.
[01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:31.350]  But I've been seeing a lot of natural predators as well, which is a good sign.
[01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:41.350]  So if we're seeing these high levels of pests out in the field, and it's also contributed to the high number of predators,
[01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:46.350]  that means that there actually may be a good sense of bio-control in these Japanese Beetles.
[01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:51.350]  So as we all know, there's nothing listed for spraying on hemp as of right now.
[01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:56.350]  And it's going to be a continuing process of learning what's out there.
[01:05:56.350 --> 01:06:01.350]  So we're at the mercy of your help.
[01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:04.350]  So if you see something, please feel free to email it to us.
[01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:14.350]  What proactive steps have you seen that have been helpful in containing or keeping pests at bay?
[01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:24.350]  Have you seen methods that have been helpful, proactive, or just sort of precautionary rather than proactive or reactive?
[01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:32.350]  So the question is, what steps have been taken to assure that you're trying to help reduce these pest levels?
[01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.350]  And just overall good agricultural practices.
[01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:43.350]  Controlling weeds, keeping weeds low because a lot of that's going to attract other pests that are going to be attracted to your area.
[01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:46.350]  Natural rotation is a big one.
[01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:54.350]  So if you're growing in the same field over and over again, you're going to want to switch it out because then you're going to have the same populations of pests there as well.
[01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:57.350]  I'm from the Portland County area, and there's a high amount of slugs and snails.
[01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:58.350]  Okay.
[01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:03.260]  How is that? I mean, how is that contributing to the growth?
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:10.260]  Yeah, so the slugs and snails are a little interesting in themselves because it's not technically in the insect category.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.260]  But I have been seeing them and spotting them when I do see them.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:19.260]  One thing that I have seen from one of the farmers that I've been out to is the itinerant.
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:26.260]  So that's a material that you can use basically as a barrier when the slugs and snails go over it, it tears them off.
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:31.260]  And so that's not necessarily a chemical-based control, but that is something that you can use.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.260]  Yes?
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:42.720]  Were you aware of a herd of slugs?
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.720]  I'm sorry, did you say disease?
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720]  What do you mean by disease?
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.720]  Okay.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.720]  So that's a big question.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:55.720]  So these don't have a lot of natural predators, the ones that I've specifically highlighted here.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.720]  The more of the things that, which makes sense why I'm not seeing them in high populations because of the natural predators,
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.720]  would be things like thrips and aphids, more of the soft-bodied insects.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:12.720]  So a lot of how these predators work is they'll inject their eggs into the soft bodies,
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:16.720]  and then that will kill them from the inside as kind of like a parasite, parasitoid.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.720]  And then also just feeding on the insects themselves.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:27.720]  So the Japanese beetle, as many of you know, is a pretty hard exoskeleton, so it doesn't have many natural predators.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.720]  And so with these kind of things, I think the long-term goal is to figure out ways to control it,
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:38.720]  whether in terms of pesticides or other bio controls that we can bring in.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:45.560]  Have you seen any more or less issues with greenhouse production?
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560]  So the greenhouse production is interesting.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.560]  I've only seen two different trials that I've been to for greenhouse.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:57.560]  And a lot of flies, actually, the majority of flies are just attracted to the hat plant itself.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.560]  They're not necessarily causing damage as in feeding on the leaves,
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.560]  but they're a nuisance in the sense of trying to work new plants and pots and pots in the greenhouse.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.560]  And then the fungicide.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.560]  Yeah, so the fungicides are actually, I haven't seen them in high populations,
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.560]  just because, I mean, the one greenhouse I was in was a seed house, or a transplant house, basically.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.560]  So they're partying them off to transplant outside.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.560]  But the fungicide is something to keep in mind, especially with consistent water.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.560]  You'll see a lot of fungicides.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.560]  Have you seen any spider bites in the field?
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.560]  So I actually have only seen one case of spider bites, which is pretty good.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:40.560]  But as you all know, we're kind of getting into the season where everything's flowering.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.560]  And from the work done in Colorado and from the West,
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:49.560]  you see a high percentage of spider bites coming after flowering, especially in the flowers.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.560]  So it's something to keep in mind as a research potential.
[01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.010]  Thanks, Matt.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.720]  So Matt is an intern funded by Cornell Cooperative Extension and a Cornell undergraduate.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.720]  I just want to take this opportunity, because of Matt's ties with CCD,
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.720]  to mention that we have a number of our CCD team specialists here.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.720]  And maybe they could stand up.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.720]  So Mike Hunter.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  Katie O'Neill.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.720]  Mike Stanier.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.720]  Mary Ulrich.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.720]  Janice Degney.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.180]  And John Hancher.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:48.180]  John Hancher, we made copies of John Hancher.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.180]  Oh, and Jody Laper.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:55.180]  So it's been tremendous working with all these folks.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:11:01.180]  And when you have problems, they are in your first line of defense.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:09.180]  So by all means, get their cards and get their regional locations so they can help you out.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:20.780]  Okay, so I'm going to talk about an experiment that we're taking on to try to address one of the,
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:25.780]  I think, one of the important issues that faces hemp cultivation,
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:33.780]  especially as we move towards an adult use marijuana program, if it's going to be outdoors here.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:37.780]  So Dave Williams at the University of Kentucky,
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:43.780]  who is one of our primary academic researchers at Hemp in the country,
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:49.780]  shared with me this unpublished data that highlights the key issue.
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.780]  That is, if you are growing for CBD production,
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:59.780]  there is a two to three fold decrease in CBD concentration in the flower shoots
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:03.780]  when the female flowers become pollinated.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:14.780]  So that is your profit rittering away when your female plants are pollinated.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:21.780]  It seems to be even worse on some of the lower flowers than the top flowers.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.780]  The question is, is that the same with THC?
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.780]  Yes, essentially the entire pathway,
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:33.780]  and I'm not sure whether it's because of the decrease in the production of the trichomes on those fishes
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:36.780]  or down regulation of the enzymes in the pathway,
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:43.780]  but the bottom line is you want to maintain, in a horticultural growth setting,
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:48.780]  you want to maintain your female plants un-pollinated.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.780]  Now it's a key question, I think, that we're facing.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.780]  This is a key question for my breeding program,
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.780]  is whether we continue on in this horticultural setting,
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:06.780]  in wide spacing from transplants, female plants, planted with Feminine Seeds,
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.780]  which is incredibly expensive.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:14.780]  So I had one grower tell me this is a $20,000 per acre investment in seeds and labor.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.780]  That could shake me's head.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:25.780]  So harvesting those plants by hand and drying them will add up to the cost.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:29.780]  The alternative is a more agricultural system,
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:33.780]  in tight spacing, allowing those plants to get pollinated,
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.780]  perhaps capturing a grain yield in addition to a CPP yield,
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.780]  mechanically harvested, mechanically dried.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.780]  That is the alternative.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.780]  I think we can breed for cultivars that produce even higher CPP.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:53.780]  So last year, Futura 75, one of our dual purpose grain and fiber cultivars,
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.780]  I'll call it a triple purpose, because it produced 2% CPP
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.780]  while also producing a reasonable grain yield.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.780]  So I think that's an issue that fundamental cultivation
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.780]  issue that growers will address.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:18.780]  We hope to breed cultivars that can make their choices a little bit easier.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.780]  Industrial hemp is wind pollinated.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:27.780]  Nate will come up and talk about some of the bees that he's seen and killed so far this year.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:31.780]  But those bees that are attracted to the male flowers
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.780]  are not attracted to the female flowers.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.780]  There's no natural production.
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:42.780]  The pollen is very light and dry, so it's carried by the wind.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:45.780]  In the Midwest, where there's a lot of ditch weed,
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:52.780]  feral hemp is grown around in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:57.780]  Hemp pollen can be more than 30% of the pollen that's trapped in late summer.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.780]  So it is a major issue.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:05.780]  Fortunately, we do not have very much feral hemp in New York State.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:09.780]  We've collected from one feral population in Fort Wayne.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.780]  I've heard about a couple of others that I will investigate here in the next month.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.780]  But we have very little feral hemp.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:18.780]  So that is not a major concern in New York State.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.780]  The major concern would be if your neighbor across the street
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:28.780]  plants a grain and fiber field of a monoecious or a dioecious variety
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:32.780]  that's going to produce a lot of pollen.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:39.780]  And you're directly downwind with your CBD or in the future, outdoor feral wine.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.780]  The question is, how far will that pollen move?
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:50.780]  So there are anecdotal stories of pollen flowing from Morocco to Spain.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.780]  It's a critical issue for certified seed production also.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.780]  It's a critical issue for certified seed production also.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:02.780]  So we can look to the AOSCA standards and the standards in Canada
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:04.780]  for certified seed production.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:09.780]  I believe the AOSCA standards are a three-mile isolation zone in Canada.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:11.780]  Five kilometers.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.780]  There is no academic research on this topic.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.780]  Very little.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.780]  So there is one paper by Ernie Small at the University of Toronto
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.780]  where they took glass slides coated with grease
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:31.780]  and trapped pollen at various instances from hemp plants.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:33.780]  And that graph is in the handout.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:37.780]  You can see that over 10 meters,
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:45.780]  there is only 20% of the pollen rain compared to next to the plant.
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:54.780]  At 400 meters, there is less than 1% of the pollen that is produced at the plant.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:59.780]  What they did not do is test whether there is sufficient pollen
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:02.780]  to pollinate those female plants.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:09.780]  Because even less than 1% of the total pollen produced may be enough to get full seed set.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:13.780]  So what we have done here, this is a challenging experiment
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.780]  because of the size of our farm.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:21.780]  We planted a three acre field of Anka over here in the rain.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:28.780]  And then planted female plants of three different cultivars.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:35.780]  Proposed to be high-seeding cultivars in micro plots.
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.780]  One of them right next to the Anka field so it should get pollinated.
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:44.780]  And then in the four ordinal directions at 200 meters away
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:50.780]  and at 400 to 500 meters away to the northwest and south.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:56.780]  On the east side, we could only go 200 meters to our property line.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:02.780]  So we jumped to 1500 meters to the east to our next available planting spot.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:07.780]  So we will monitor those plants for signs of pollination.
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:12.780]  At the end of the season, we will quantify seed yield by plant
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:16.780]  as a measure of functional pollination.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:23.780]  And we will also extract cannabinoids and quantify CBD production by plant.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.780]  So this will give us sort of a dual-purpose experiment.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:32.780]  We will get a lot of site information, genotype by environment information,
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:36.780]  on CBD production because we've got nine different sites here.
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.780]  And we will also be able to verify Dave Williams' data
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.780]  about the two to three fold drop in CBD production upon pollination.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:50.780]  This is our first attempt.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:54.780]  I think, you know, the conditions here in New York State
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:59.780]  with our topography, with our moist climate, so to speak,
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:04.780]  compared to Oregon and Colorado where they talk about
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:10.780]  10-mile pollen movement, I think our distances will be much shorter
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:14.780]  than the potential distances in Oregon and Colorado.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:18.780]  But we need to replicate the data to get the data.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.780]  I'll stop there and I'd be happy to take any questions.
[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:40.490]  So the question is, the question is,
[01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:46.490]  who is going to manage the geographic arrangement of fiber plantings,
[01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:53.490]  grain and fiber plantings, versus CBD and potentially marijuana plantings?
[01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:58.490]  The state ag and markets have already said that they will not regulate that.
[01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:04.490]  They are not interested in imposing regulated pollen exclusion zones
[01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:09.490]  to the preference of CBD producers over our grain and fiber production.
[01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:16.490]  What I would suggest is that meetings like this, you get to know your neighbors.
[01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:23.490]  Because in my opinion, the best way to regulate that is neighbor to neighbor.
[01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.490]  But sometimes that's not going to work.
[01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:32.490]  And you may need to work it out through other means.
[01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:39.490]  That may be talking about rotating fields, varying distances,
[01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:45.490]  compensating someone not to plant in one field in preference for another field.
[01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:51.490]  The ultimate assurance is to move your plants indoors.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.640]  Sorry, is there any group house production?
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.640]  Is there insect screening or something like that?
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:17.800]  Yeah, so the question is, how much risk are you for pollination in a group house, for example?
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.800]  And there's absolutely no data on that.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.800]  Hemp pollen is very small.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.800]  I think you have to have a very small mesh.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.800]  Are you aware?
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800]  I know a guy.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:46.800]  So, yeah, in terms of group house production, or really screens to keep out pollen,
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.800]  I know a bit about this, that people are looking for screens to keep out pathogens.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.800]  And depending on the pathogen, the pollen and the pathogen may be of similar sizes.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:07.800]  So I know one vegetable grower who wants to keep all pathogens out of his high tunnel group houses.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:15.800]  And he actually put HEPA filters on the ends of the high tunnels, and that has been extremely effective.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.800]  So he grows tomatoes.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.800]  And tomatoes are really happy at 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:30.800]  So if you're trying to grow hemp for CBD at 120 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.800]  chances are your THC levels are going to go through the roof.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:42.800]  And I think that HEPA filters are the only filter that's going to be effective in keeping pollen out.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:17.680]  I think the question is about isolation distances for certified seed production.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.680]  Can you talk about how Canada regulates isolation zones?
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:33.680]  So for certified seed production in Canada, for industrial hemp, we actually have three levels of isolation distances.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:39.680]  The closest for just certified seed production is one kilometer of the same variety.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.680]  This is a Mono-Asian cultivar.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.680]  It has to be five kilometers of this isolation between a Mono-Asian cultivar and a rice cultivar.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:51.680]  It has to be five kilometers isolation with different cultivars.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:59.680]  If it's the same cultivar but of a higher pedigree, it can be, I think it's three kilometers isolation between those different pedigrees.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.680]  So you start from breeder, so you have breeder, foundation, registered, certified in terms of the level of pedigree.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.680]  And then you have the inspection for seed certification in terms of the...
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.680]  Other questions?
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.680]  Nate, are you ready? Nate or Heather?
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.680]  Yeah, Heather, you're back?
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.680]  Yep.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.680]  So this is a final question for our team.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:35.320]  So the question is, will we measure THC before pollination and after pollination?
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.320]  So we have not collected any samples yet and there is active pollen production in our field.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:50.320]  So our intention is, our hope is that some of these microplots will not be pollinated by the end of the season.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.320]  And those will be our measure of non-pollinated plants.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.320]  You discussed how THC is reduced after the plant has been pollinated.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:08.320]  I'm wondering, is that also a way to probably save crops that could be pollinated?
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.320]  We might have less THC, but we save crops that have been pollinated.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:19.320]  Oh, so the question is, could you recover from a field that's gone hot by pollinating it?
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:25.320]  I don't know where you would, at the end of the season, where you would all of a sudden get all this pollen.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:40.320]  It's a good idea on a small scale, if you have plants elsewhere that were actively making pollen.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:55.160]  There's no data from Colorado or Oregon or California?
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.160]  There are no public papers.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.160]  Not at all, but just like talking to growers.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.160]  Yeah, you talk to growers and they'll say, you've got to be 10 miles away from me.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.160]  So it's anecdotal.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:25.160]  I have not, I've only been doing this a year and a half, I have not encountered anyone who has told me, yeah, my field got pollinated and ruined.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.160]  I just haven't encountered that.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.160]  So there's a lot of typing.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160]  I don't know how real it is.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:51.160]  What I have encountered is folks from Europe who have said, I have my field here, my neighbor has his field over there, you can see it, we are never crop-pollinated.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.400]  Okay, it's my pleasure to introduce Dr. Heather Graff.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:08.720]  Hi, I'm Dr. Larry, can everybody hear me okay?
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:09.720]  Wonderful.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:32.860]  Alright, so given that Larry just told you all that he does a nice, wide cluster, he's got cerns, saving the bees, all that good stuff.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:37.860]  Awesome, so that's what we're working on in our epidemiology lab down in Ithaca.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:48.860]  We work on all kinds of beneficial insects, but we've heard quite a bit about all of the bees that are showing up in the industrial field and trials.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.860]  So we decided to come out and take a look and see what's going on.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:28:03.860]  Not because we think that having bees in the field is a benefit to farmers per se, but we think it could actually be a huge benefit to the bees that are out there.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:09.860]  So a lot of research is going on figuring out why we're treating so many of our bees.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:19.860]  We've identified a lack of pollen, a lack of soil resources as a major key that are out there every day pollinating your crops.
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:22.860]  But they're also looking for other things to eat.
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:28.860]  When strawberries aren't blooming, apples aren't blooming, squash isn't blooming.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:39.860]  And we know that during the window, when hemp is starting to flower, that's the period of time in New York State where we have very few soil resources on our landscapes.
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:48.860]  So potentially as we grow this industry, we're starting to add a huge resource for our wild bees back into our landscape.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:58.860]  So part of what we are doing this summer as things are starting to bloom is to go out and survey in fields and figure out which bees are benefiting.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:05.860]  And it may not be that yourselves are benefiting very much from having those bees there, but you grow other crops.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:16.860]  If your neighbors are growing pollinators in your crops, if you have an apple orchard that's blooming in the spring, strawberries, raspberries, squash, peeled tomatoes, any of these other crops,
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:22.860]  the same bees that we're seeing right now in the hemp fields are the bees that are the most affected.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:33.860]  So by supporting them in a period of time when there may be very many other pollinators around, we could actually be contributing to supporting their population overall.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:41.860]  And have a longer incentive for effect. Not just for wild bees in general, but also for crop production outside of hemp.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:48.860]  So I'm going to hand it over to Nate, and he's going to tell you a little bit about the details of the project and the survey that we're doing right now.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:30:03.860]  Yeah, so the main kind of motivation behind the project is with this new huge surge of hemp in New York City, how it is going to be affecting the bee communities we have here right now.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:12.860]  And pretty much we've seen so far that hemp, or bees really do love hemp. Like Larry was saying, hemp is completely mis-pollinated.
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:19.860]  Hemp doesn't have extra floral nectarines, so bees can't collect nectar from it. They're only getting pollen.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:26.860]  We haven't seen bees visit these male flowers, so the bees are not pollinating the hemp at all.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:35.860]  But we have seen them go to hemp in mass. We've seen a lot of bees there. Bumblebees, honeybees, and also a lot of native bees.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:41.860]  So what we've done is we have ten farms around Ithaca, Geneva, and Minnetonka.
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:45.860]  And we're going to be visiting them three or four times to feed them to bees.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:52.860]  We're going to be collecting all the bees we catch, bring them back to the lab, and identify them as species.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:31:04.860]  And then we're going to look at them in the crop network, like Heather was saying, and see where the bees that we see at each site overlap with other crops in that landscape.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:19.860]  We're also hopefully going to be looking at floral resources within the landscape to see how much bees have in that site and whether that's influencing them coming to the site.
[01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:31.680]  The end out has a huge amount of pollen.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:32:31.720]  So, great question. The question is about what happens when bees, particularly honeybees, because they're the ones that are bees, are visiting these crops, collecting pollen, bringing it back to the hive where it may mix in with honey.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:37.720]  And so far we have no data on what that means for those honey colonies.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:40.720]  There are certainly lots of things that we are tracking.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.720]  Other bodies that are coming in, so we're worrying a lot about pesticides.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.720]  These are picking up with poison in them.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:55.720]  Given the current regulatory status of hemp, we don't have to worry about them bringing back pesticides and pesticides and other things back to the lab.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:00.720]  But are they bringing in common CBD or CABD in pollen?
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:04.720]  We don't know, but we certainly don't have a crystal ball.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.720]  There's so much dead weed in the Midwest.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:11.720]  There must be a lot of pollinated bees.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:21.200]  We have 72 hives on our property right next to the hemp field.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:26.200]  But we've really seen maybe two or three bees on hemp plants.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.200]  They're all avoiding it, basically.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:35.200]  So, I don't know if any of your sites actually have bees right next to the hemp field or not.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:41.200]  So, we're hearing about a scenario where we have a lot of hives right next to a field of hemp.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.200]  Nine acres.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.200]  Nine acres.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.200]  Okay, and that's something that we have been noticing is when we're on really large fields,
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.200]  like even in the field that we have down the road that's three acres,
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.200]  we see many fewer bees per plant in those kinds of scenarios.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:03.200]  And it's probably not that they're avoiding a field so much, it's that they're just diluted in the field.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:08.200]  So, we don't see them as often as we would when we have small trials
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.200]  that's just a micro-blot planting where there's really a ton of bees.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:19.200]  But it's also probably a factor, maybe your park has something else that they like better nearby.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.200]  Honeybees are social.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:26.200]  They can recruit foragers into really high-quality source areas.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:32.200]  So, they might have something better right now that they're going to, but that's not always the case.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:47.240]  Alright, we are in the homestretch, gang.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:51.240]  So, if anyone does not have a handout, Larry can give you one.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.240]  It looks like all the others more or less, but it says,
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.240]  Evaluation of industrial hemp cultivars for CBD.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:05.240]  And I was really looking forward to having folks up at our CBD trial this morning.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.240]  Because, you know, when I started this a couple years ago,
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:13.240]  I heard, oh, hemp can grow anywhere, hemp grows fast.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.240]  We got some plants that are downright dead.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.240]  And I think it's important for you guys to understand that, you know,
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:27.240]  there are places where hemp loves to grow, and there are places that hemp is really unhappy.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:32.240]  And so, where we have one of our CBD variety trials,
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:38.240]  if you look at the back of the sheet, you can see the list of the CBD varieties.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.240]  You can see the list of varieties.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:45.240]  The varieties that were planted were started in the greenhouse,
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:50.240]  because we wanted to ensure that we had germination and plant establishment.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.240]  And actually, Larry's left in the back, the folks on the stairs over there.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:56.240]  Team hemp.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.240]  And the plants were then in storage pots and planted into the fields.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:05.240]  And the dates were early July.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:10.240]  July 6th in our Intica trial, and July 9th in Geneva.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:15.240]  So when those were planted, we were just at the end of the very dry period.
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:20.240]  So we had, they're on raised beds with drip irrigation and plastic.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.240]  And we were irrigating them, and then it started to rain.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:31.240]  And one end of the field that they're in is just a wee bit lower than the other end.
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.240]  So the water drained that way.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:38.240]  And the plants that had wet feet for an extended period of time,
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.240]  even though they were on raised beds, some of them flat out died.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.240]  Some of them are extremely stunted.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:50.240]  And as you go down the field, when you get that slight incline,
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.240]  the plants at the end that was just a bit drier are doing quite well.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:03.240]  So I think it's really important to know that that concept that you can plant it and it will grow is not always the case.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.240]  So that's an interesting trial to see.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:11.240]  The reason that we're doing the trial is to answer some of the questions that many of you have asked
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:20.240]  in terms of what impacts CBD levels and what impacts THC levels here in the state of New York.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:28.240]  If you're growing for CBD, you don't want your plants to hit above that 0.3% THC level.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:34.240]  And we have information from Colorado and Oregon and Kentucky,
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.240]  but we don't have information on the stressors in New York.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:44.240]  For example, the plants that have now had wet feet for much of their lives in the field,
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:51.240]  are they going to have a higher THC or CBD content because of that blood stress?
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.240]  And we don't know.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:38:02.240]  So to compare, we actually are growing the ultra-rich CBD, the seven ultra-rich varieties from Nevada.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.240]  We're growing those in our greenhouse.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:15.240]  And what we want to do is compare the yield as well as the CBD and the THC levels of the greenhouse grown plants
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.240]  to those plants that were grown in the field.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:25.240]  And for this year, we'll compare the Ithaca trial, the Geneva trial, and the greenhouse plant.
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:31.240]  And I saw some pictures that Jamie, I think, showed that the plants in the field,
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.240]  the plant architecture is one of the things that we're looking at in these varieties.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.240]  So in a heavy rain and wind down in the Ithaca trial, was that last week, Jamie?
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.240]  Some of the plants actually snapped.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:51.240]  The stem was just not strong enough to handle the foliage and the plant architecture that was above.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.240]  Oh, that would be dramatic.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:06.240]  So what we're measuring on all of these plants right now, we are measuring establishment.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.240]  If they die, we're measuring plant architecture.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:14.240]  And we're doing that by counting the number of nodes where leaves would come out of the plant
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.240]  and then the number of nodes that have branches.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.240]  So that gives you an idea of how branchy the plant is.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:26.240]  For some people, they're looking for a big branchy plant that looks more like a Christmas tree.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.240]  And for other folks, they want maybe a single head.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:34.240]  And so we want to be able to provide you with, in New York, in our state land,
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.240]  what is the plant going to look like?
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.240]  And that's really the goal of this study.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.240]  So we'll have plant architecture, we'll have height, and in the greenhouse,
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:47.240]  what are our tallest plants now? Two meters?
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.240]  Something like that, yeah.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:55.240]  Yeah, and in the field, they're roughly the same.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.240]  So we have plant height as well as architecture.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:06.240]  And then what we'll have is not only CBC levels, but we hope to have the whole panel
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:16.240]  of cannabidiol, cannabinoid compounds, so that we can give you an idea of what is being produced
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.240]  on this condition, each of the conditions that we had our trials in.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.240]  As we move forward, we hope to then be able to compare.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.240]  Next year, we hope to have some plants in high tunnels.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:34.240]  Right now, our high tunnels are in a place that gets rather wet, so that will have to be modified.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.240]  But it would be great to be able to give you guys information on high tunnel production
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.240]  versus greenhouse production versus field production.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:44.240]  And that's what we really hope to be able to do with some of the varieties.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:51.240]  And then as new cultivars come along, new genetics in the plants, we hope to be able to test,
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:56.240]  as Larry said, one of the things we really want to be able to do with experiments like this
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:05.240]  is to test rapidly, so we can sort of on the fly understand how stress conditions are modifying
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.240]  the secondary metabolites, or CBDs, in the plants.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:17.240]  So one of the things that my lab is doing along those same lines is we're looking at the hemp microbiome.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:23.240]  So you've heard of the human microbiome, we all have microbes on our skin and in our stomach,
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.240]  and that affects many, many attributes of our health.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:29.240]  The same exact thing is true in plants.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:38.240]  And one of my students, a PhD student, Allie Calla, has looked last year at the microbiome of the hemp plant.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.240]  And she has now, we think, identified sort of the microbes that are on hemp.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:49.240]  She looked at six different locations, and we have sort of a core microbiome.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:56.240]  And that's sort of a starting place in terms of understanding what bacteria and fungi are on plants.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.240]  And these aren't necessarily pests, they're just present and interacting with the plant.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:09.240]  It's known from other systems that the microbes on the plant can modify things like drought tolerance,
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:17.240]  flowering time, and secondary metabolism, which could modify our THC or CBD levels.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.240]  So we really want to know what's there.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:26.240]  Additionally, if there are beneficial microbes that are being, you know, they're associating with the roots of plants,
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.240]  if we can identify some of those, then we can work with Al Taylor,
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:36.240]  who is an expert at using things like that to actually enhance plant growth.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:39.240]  So those are some of the things that we're working on.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:49.240]  One thing that Allie found that I thought was absolutely fascinating was that in the microbes that are found on the flowers of the hemp plant,
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:58.240]  the most common microbes are those microbes that have previously been reported from extreme environments,
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:01.240]  like hot springs and high salt.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:10.240]  And so there's something, you know, the secondary metabolites in the flower of the plant that the microbes that associate there
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:13.240]  are those that can handle extreme environments.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.240]  And so that's something that we'll be looking into as well.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.240]  So were there other things about the varietal trials?
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.240]  Flowering time.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.240]  Oh, right. For sure. Flowering time.
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:35.240]  We're noting that both in the greenhouse and in the field, and the field plants have flowered earlier than the greenhouse plants.
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.240]  What's all the seeds and the grapevines?
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.240]  Sorry?
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:43.240]  What's all the seeds and plants and the grapevines?
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:50.240]  We do have one plant, but it wasn't planted after the field. Everything was from seeds.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.240]  How many of the varieties are auto flower versus photoferias?
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:01.240]  So there are some auto flower. I don't know how many.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.240]  I think we have, I think four of them are auto flowering.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.240]  If one of the data comes out, would that be the...
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.240]  Yeah, that'll be included. For sure.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:16.240]  But we have cultivars or lines that still have not flowered.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:23.240]  So we have both males and females in the population, and as soon as we see a male, we cut that out.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.240]  And there are cultivars that have not flowered yet.
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.240]  We don't even know if the plants are male or female.
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:36.240]  In the future, will you try varieties that come from places that plant them when seeds?
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:43.240]  Great question. In the future, will we try varieties or cultivars that can handle more rain?
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.240]  And if we can find those, absolutely.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.240]  Because I think that's going to be one of the things that our breeding program,
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:56.240]  our breeding program that is led by Dr. Smart, will look at.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:59.240]  Along with flowering time and daylight.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:06.240]  Yes, so we do have artificial lighting in the greenhouse, but it is not longer than the daylight.
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:09.240]  Did you want to add?
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:17.240]  Right, right. So that's one of the things that we hope to get out of our high tunnel experiments next year.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.240]  Is that, you know, can we manage more rain?
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:26.240]  Yes, so the question is, did the dry period at the beginning of the year cause excess stress
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.240]  on the plants causing them to flower earlier compared to those in the greenhouse?
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.240]  And I think it's a combination of the dry at the beginning and the excess stress at the end.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:41.450]  So, I think that's a good question.
[01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:43.450]  And I think that's a good question.
[01:45:43.450 --> 01:45:45.450]  And I think that's a good question.
[01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:47.450]  And I think that's a good question.
[01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:49.450]  And I think that's a good question.
[01:45:49.450 --> 01:46:21.990]  And I think it's a combination of the dry at the beginning, followed by prolonged wetness.
[01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:28.990]  We have been having, we have, we've had a lot of discussions on how are we going to
[01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:35.990]  do that and yeah, how are we going to do that, how are we going to, and you know, when it
[01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:38.990]  looks like they're going to get stressed and certainly we need to harvest before fall.
[01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:45.990]  And so that will be taken into account and my guess is that we'll probably, depending
[01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:49.990]  on the weather, say sometime between mid to end of September and then phase our 20 days
[01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.990]  on that.
[01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.990]  Yes?
[01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.990]  You were talking about the plant structure and the height.
[01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.990]  Great, great question.
[01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.990]  So I was talking about plant architecture and height and how do we take into account
[01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.990]  any pruning that might happen.
[01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.990]  And so we are not doing any pruning at all.
[01:46:56.990 --> 01:47:02.010]  There are, you know, of course some leaves that have dropped, but we're not doing any
[01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:03.010]  pruning for this particular trial.
[01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:04.010]  Yeah.
[01:47:05.010 --> 01:47:24.010]  So in future trials, when we, oh, no.
[01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:39.000]  So in future trials, we'll be doing pruning to make clones.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  And for my part of the experiment, I won't be doing pruning to make clones out of the old malaria.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  Do you have thoughts on that?
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  So the issue is the material transfer agreements under which we obtain this material.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  So if we are restricted against cultivating it and propagating it for cuttings, we won't do that.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  For that material that we are allowed to make cuttings, we will probably try to do that and again use that material for breeding.
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:15.960]  Alright, thank you very much.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:28.840]  I just want to mention one more project that we're working on, which is to...
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:34.840]  I'm sure many of you have seen the Phylos galaxy. If you haven't, you should go take a look at it.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:47.840]  Phylos Biosciences, that's with a P-H-Y-L-O-S, is a company based in Portland that will analyze the DNA of your hemp or marijuana plant
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.840]  and compare it with everything else that they've got in their database.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.840]  I think they have thousands of samples in their database.
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:01.840]  It's very cool. We've looked at which cultivars are related to one another genetically.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.840]  It's like a 23andMe or Ancestry.com analysis for cannabis.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:11.840]  Phylos, P-H-Y-L-O-S.
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:19.840]  They have a very cool web interface where you can zoom through the Phylos galaxy.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:26.840]  We are trying to do the same thing for the CBD cultivars that folks are growing in New York State.
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:40.840]  I have already collected small leaf samples from four different farms to extract DNA to do that similar type of genetic fingerprinting analysis.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.840]  You can see we're already up to 35 different names of cultivars.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.840]  The question is, are those true to type?
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:57.840]  None of these were purchased under a certified seed program that would verify that they are true to type.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.840]  How related are they to one another?
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.840]  How distinct?
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.840]  Is there genetic differences between these that would be of interest to us in our breeding program?
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.840]  I know there are a number of growers here I want to connect with where I haven't been able to sample yet.
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:19.840]  They are willing to help me go and collect some small leaf samples for DNA extraction.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:23.840]  That is something we hope to be able to publish next year.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:35.360]  When you buy cascade or Lichter or Electra from the Crawford brothers,
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:42.360]  is it really any different from buying cherry wine or cherry blossom from St. Daniel's?
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:53.920]  I think that brings the formal presentations to a conclusion.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:00.920]  Again, I'm really sorry we can't make it out to the field, but I would like to open it up and give folks an opportunity.
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.920]  If you need to take off, you can take off.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:11.920]  If you have questions, I'd like to open it up for a general question and answer session now.
