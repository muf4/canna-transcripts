[00:00.000 --> 00:02.560]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.040 --> 00:11.200]  So first off, thank you so much for the invite.
[00:11.200 --> 00:14.280]  And I apologize that I couldn't attend in person.
[00:15.120 --> 00:17.560]  Unfortunately, there was a lot going on this week
[00:17.560 --> 00:21.600]  and we're prepping for a board meeting next Monday.
[00:21.600 --> 00:23.220]  But my name is Pat McKeage.
[00:23.220 --> 00:25.400]  I am the first deputy director
[00:25.400 --> 00:27.800]  of the Office of Cannabis Management.
[00:29.200 --> 00:33.580]  As I was kind of saying, there is a lot going on,
[00:33.580 --> 00:37.340]  but it's starting to really feel like a real agency here.
[00:37.340 --> 00:40.500]  We're officially over 100 FTEs.
[00:40.500 --> 00:42.300]  So that's exciting.
[00:42.300 --> 00:45.660]  We actually have like an admin unit, a legal unit,
[00:45.660 --> 00:49.160]  operations, inspectors out in the field.
[00:49.160 --> 00:52.140]  So it's exciting to kind of see this whole thing develop
[00:52.140 --> 00:54.720]  over these past kind of eight months.
[00:54.720 --> 00:57.740]  And we're hoping to really continue that momentum
[00:57.740 --> 01:00.060]  into the fall and into the winter
[01:00.060 --> 01:03.900]  as we expand the cannabinoid hemp program,
[01:03.900 --> 01:05.620]  the medical cannabis program,
[01:05.620 --> 01:09.020]  and hopefully launch the adult use market,
[01:09.020 --> 01:11.340]  which I know gets a lot of the attention
[01:11.340 --> 01:14.380]  and is really a big shift
[01:14.380 --> 01:19.380]  for how just in regular everyday life for New Yorkers.
[01:19.540 --> 01:22.060]  So exciting times and I apologize,
[01:22.060 --> 01:23.620]  I couldn't be there in person.
[01:25.020 --> 01:28.420]  So today I'll just give a little overview
[01:28.460 --> 01:30.660]  of the cannabinoid hemp program
[01:30.660 --> 01:34.140]  and some update on some other cannabis programs
[01:34.140 --> 01:37.060]  and activities that are going on in New York State.
[01:38.220 --> 01:41.220]  So quickly, just a legislative background
[01:41.220 --> 01:42.860]  of kind of how we got here.
[01:42.860 --> 01:47.560]  The cannabinoid hemp program was officially created in 2020.
[01:50.300 --> 01:53.340]  Came out of those research partnership agreements
[01:53.340 --> 01:55.640]  and the research partnership program
[01:55.640 --> 01:58.300]  from the Department of Ag and Markets.
[01:59.140 --> 02:02.100]  There was kind of a split in terms of regulatory authority.
[02:02.100 --> 02:05.780]  So the cultivation, as you just heard from Tim,
[02:05.780 --> 02:07.940]  everything related to growing the crop
[02:07.940 --> 02:11.340]  and up until harvest is all at
[02:11.340 --> 02:12.780]  the Department of Ag and Markets
[02:12.780 --> 02:15.420]  and they follow the USDA regulations
[02:15.420 --> 02:17.100]  and the 2018 Farm Bill.
[02:18.060 --> 02:19.940]  But then after that point,
[02:19.940 --> 02:24.060]  anything that is processed or manufactured
[02:24.060 --> 02:25.500]  for its cannabinoid content.
[02:25.500 --> 02:27.420]  So any of those products that you've
[02:27.420 --> 02:28.940]  probably been seeing around,
[02:28.940 --> 02:32.340]  tinctures, food, beverages,
[02:32.340 --> 02:34.220]  smokable hemp flour,
[02:34.220 --> 02:38.820]  that is all regulated by the Office of Cannabis Management.
[02:39.860 --> 02:41.820]  So the program originally started
[02:41.820 --> 02:43.740]  at the Department of Health
[02:43.740 --> 02:46.500]  and then similar to the medical cannabis program
[02:46.500 --> 02:47.940]  was transitioned over
[02:47.940 --> 02:50.180]  to this new Office of Cannabis Management
[02:50.180 --> 02:53.700]  when the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act,
[02:53.700 --> 02:58.700]  the MRTA passed in March 31st of 2021.
[02:59.700 --> 03:03.700]  So that transition happened in law immediately,
[03:05.220 --> 03:06.700]  but then it took several months
[03:06.700 --> 03:08.900]  for us to actually stand up the office
[03:08.900 --> 03:11.380]  and officially move people over here,
[03:11.380 --> 03:13.420]  hire new staff, get a board,
[03:13.420 --> 03:14.540]  establish all those things.
[03:14.540 --> 03:19.540]  So I think officially it was the November 3rd board meeting
[03:20.220 --> 03:22.380]  where we transferred the regulations
[03:22.380 --> 03:24.740]  over to the Office of Cannabis Management,
[03:24.740 --> 03:26.540]  which I guess we can technically say,
[03:26.540 --> 03:29.260]  the Cannabinoid Hemp Program started
[03:29.260 --> 03:31.660]  here at the Office of Cannabis Management.
[03:32.780 --> 03:34.820]  And when we talk about cannabinoid hemp
[03:34.820 --> 03:36.740]  and what we regulate,
[03:36.740 --> 03:39.340]  we really only are talking about products
[03:39.340 --> 03:41.780]  that are sold for their cannabinoid content.
[03:41.780 --> 03:46.380]  So not talking about seed or fiber products,
[03:46.380 --> 03:50.700]  anything related to just standard hemp food
[03:50.700 --> 03:51.900]  or stuff like that,
[03:52.420 --> 03:55.260]  does not fall under our regulatory jurisdiction.
[03:55.260 --> 03:57.620]  That would still be under either Ag and Markets
[03:57.620 --> 04:00.420]  from a food perspective or the Department of Health,
[04:00.420 --> 04:03.420]  if you're like a restaurant selling those products.
[04:04.340 --> 04:07.540]  And we were conscious to use the term cannabinoid
[04:07.540 --> 04:09.780]  and not just CBD,
[04:09.780 --> 04:13.780]  understanding there's many cannabinoids in this plant.
[04:13.780 --> 04:16.860]  And as I'm sure you've seen,
[04:17.900 --> 04:21.060]  people are interested in cannabinoids beyond CBD.
[04:21.060 --> 04:23.060]  And I think we're starting to see,
[04:23.060 --> 04:26.900]  CBN products, CBG products creep into the market
[04:26.900 --> 04:30.060]  along with just general full spectrum products
[04:30.060 --> 04:32.580]  that incorporate minor cannabinoids, terpenes
[04:32.580 --> 04:36.260]  and stuff like that into their product.
[04:38.460 --> 04:42.020]  So the reason for why this program exists
[04:42.020 --> 04:45.020]  is really a stopgap measure
[04:45.020 --> 04:49.660]  to account for the fact that we have hemp products,
[04:49.660 --> 04:53.820]  cannabinoid hemp products, widely available online,
[04:53.820 --> 04:55.740]  in stores throughout New York State
[04:55.740 --> 04:57.380]  and throughout the country.
[04:57.380 --> 05:00.340]  However, there's no federal regulations
[05:00.340 --> 05:03.980]  that is governing how these products should be manufactured,
[05:03.980 --> 05:05.860]  what should be included on the label.
[05:06.820 --> 05:11.820]  Because the FDA has a primary regulatory jurisdiction here,
[05:11.860 --> 05:15.540]  they have not taken any action really
[05:15.540 --> 05:17.460]  to regulate this industry
[05:17.460 --> 05:20.260]  because of a pharmaceutically approved drug
[05:20.260 --> 05:23.380]  that has CBD as an active ingredient in it.
[05:24.260 --> 05:27.500]  There's a number of bills in Congress
[05:27.500 --> 05:32.500]  that would get FDA involved in the regulation of this
[05:32.740 --> 05:34.420]  and kind of force their hand.
[05:34.420 --> 05:36.660]  I know they're looking at the issue, I've met with them,
[05:36.660 --> 05:38.020]  I've talked with them.
[05:38.020 --> 05:42.700]  They're aware, but they're a very slow government agency
[05:42.700 --> 05:45.660]  that is operating on evidence
[05:45.660 --> 05:48.820]  that typically takes years and years and years
[05:48.820 --> 05:51.460]  to develop and research.
[05:51.460 --> 05:55.060]  So it's a bit of a catch-22 at the moment.
[05:55.060 --> 05:58.060]  And to kind of account for that fact
[05:58.060 --> 06:00.220]  that these products are available,
[06:00.220 --> 06:02.300]  the Cannabinoid Hemp Program is intended
[06:02.300 --> 06:05.740]  to offer some guidance in terms of
[06:05.740 --> 06:08.020]  how these products can be manufactured,
[06:08.020 --> 06:09.660]  how they can be labeled.
[06:09.660 --> 06:13.980]  And it's really not meant to reinvent the wheel.
[06:13.980 --> 06:16.500]  We're trying to point to regulations that exist
[06:16.500 --> 06:17.740]  for similar products,
[06:17.740 --> 06:21.260]  either at the dietary supplement level or food products
[06:21.260 --> 06:22.740]  or other cannabis products,
[06:22.740 --> 06:26.420]  as you see in like adult use or medical cannabis programs,
[06:26.420 --> 06:28.380]  trying to kind of pull best practices
[06:28.380 --> 06:33.380]  from those three regulatory kind of frameworks
[06:33.620 --> 06:36.260]  to build this Cannabinoid Hemp Program.
[06:36.260 --> 06:40.100]  So consumers are aware of what they're getting,
[06:40.100 --> 06:41.580]  what's on the product.
[06:41.580 --> 06:45.220]  And I can't count the number of studies
[06:45.220 --> 06:46.660]  that have been done out there
[06:46.660 --> 06:49.020]  where a lab will just sample
[06:49.020 --> 06:52.100]  some of the cannabinoid products on the market.
[06:52.100 --> 06:56.540]  And routinely, 50% of them don't have what's on the label.
[06:56.540 --> 07:00.500]  They're either containing X percent more CBD
[07:00.500 --> 07:02.020]  than they say they're containing.
[07:02.020 --> 07:05.220]  They sometimes don't contain CBD at all.
[07:05.220 --> 07:08.820]  They're sometimes labeled as THC-free and they have THC,
[07:08.820 --> 07:10.900]  which really can be an issue for someone
[07:11.420 --> 07:13.820]  who has a commercial driver's license
[07:13.820 --> 07:17.660]  or other type of federal rules,
[07:17.660 --> 07:21.180]  which would mandate them to drug testing.
[07:21.180 --> 07:26.180]  So that is really, these three bullets are the core,
[07:26.180 --> 07:29.380]  I guess, foundation of what the Cannabinoid Hemp Program
[07:29.380 --> 07:30.620]  is supposed to do.
[07:31.980 --> 07:36.100]  So getting into some of those requirements that are there,
[07:36.100 --> 07:37.860]  we require all of our processors
[07:37.860 --> 07:41.220]  to follow good manufacturing practices.
[07:41.220 --> 07:44.660]  So part of the application process to be a processor,
[07:44.660 --> 07:47.540]  you have to get a GMP audit of your facility.
[07:50.420 --> 07:51.980]  From our understanding,
[07:51.980 --> 07:55.460]  pretty similar to how other products work.
[07:55.460 --> 07:59.740]  And if the FDA were to ever step into this regulatory space,
[07:59.740 --> 08:01.620]  they would likely require this.
[08:01.620 --> 08:04.300]  So we're hoping that New York processors
[08:04.300 --> 08:07.700]  are gonna be a leg up from maybe some other processors
[08:08.540 --> 08:10.020]  in other states when the federal government
[08:10.020 --> 08:11.820]  does step into this space.
[08:12.740 --> 08:15.780]  We require some basic packaging and labeling,
[08:15.780 --> 08:18.620]  labeling how much CBD is in the project,
[08:18.620 --> 08:20.220]  making sure that the consumer is aware
[08:20.220 --> 08:22.380]  of how much THC is in the product,
[08:23.500 --> 08:27.820]  stating a serving size for the product.
[08:27.820 --> 08:30.340]  That's one thing that we are learning.
[08:30.340 --> 08:32.420]  We've actually done some focus group testing
[08:32.420 --> 08:36.980]  and some surveys related to folks asking them,
[08:37.060 --> 08:39.180]  what's a typical dose?
[08:39.180 --> 08:41.900]  What does five milligrams of THC mean to you?
[08:42.860 --> 08:44.500]  And it's really interesting
[08:44.500 --> 08:46.980]  because even experienced users
[08:46.980 --> 08:48.900]  or people who use cannabis frequently,
[08:49.940 --> 08:52.980]  they don't know about the milligrams of THC
[08:52.980 --> 08:54.100]  and how that interacts.
[08:54.100 --> 08:57.300]  And because it's different for each user,
[08:57.300 --> 09:00.420]  it's really a difficult thing to try and regulate.
[09:00.420 --> 09:04.820]  And so we're taking approach of starting low, going slow,
[09:04.820 --> 09:07.460]  starting out with a lower serving sizes,
[09:07.460 --> 09:10.900]  but people can include more cannabinoids in the product
[09:10.900 --> 09:14.420]  as long as it's just transparent and aware for the consumer.
[09:14.420 --> 09:18.180]  And then lastly here, similar to our medical cannabis
[09:18.180 --> 09:20.660]  and adult use cannabis programs,
[09:20.660 --> 09:22.660]  we do require laboratory testing.
[09:22.660 --> 09:26.220]  So each lot of a cannabinoid hemp product
[09:26.220 --> 09:30.940]  needs to be lab tested for a list of analytes
[09:30.940 --> 09:35.460]  and the consumer should be able to look up
[09:35.460 --> 09:38.420]  the certificate of analysis for that lab
[09:38.420 --> 09:43.060]  if they ever wanna dig deeper and have some reassurance
[09:43.060 --> 09:45.940]  that the lot did pass required testing.
[09:48.300 --> 09:51.700]  And so here you can see the amount of licenses
[09:51.700 --> 09:53.300]  that we have issued to date.
[09:54.620 --> 09:59.140]  The retail license really is more of a registration.
[09:59.140 --> 10:01.660]  So anyone who's selling cannabinoid hemp products
[10:01.660 --> 10:05.020]  in New York state is required to get a license
[10:05.020 --> 10:07.900]  from our office to sell these products.
[10:07.900 --> 10:10.940]  We're over 3,000 now for retailers.
[10:10.940 --> 10:13.020]  The application process probably only takes
[10:13.020 --> 10:14.060]  around 10 minutes.
[10:14.060 --> 10:17.620]  There's not too many questions that are required.
[10:17.620 --> 10:19.540]  I think you have to just prove
[10:19.540 --> 10:21.460]  that you have a certificate of authority,
[10:21.460 --> 10:23.180]  list what type of products you're selling
[10:23.180 --> 10:26.460]  and then the location and your website.
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.500]  So it's pretty straightforward.
[10:28.860 --> 10:30.860]  We're really trying to increase that number
[10:30.860 --> 10:33.300]  because we do know that there's likely
[10:34.220 --> 10:37.060]  four, 5,000 more locations
[10:37.060 --> 10:40.260]  that are selling cannabinoid products
[10:40.260 --> 10:43.140]  just because they are being sold at gas stations
[10:43.140 --> 10:47.740]  and bodegas and CBD and vape shops are really popping up
[10:47.740 --> 10:50.140]  in a lot of locations that sell these products.
[10:51.340 --> 10:54.500]  As you'll see, we've now licensed over
[10:54.500 --> 10:59.220]  or just under 50 processors.
[10:59.220 --> 11:00.660]  So that's really exciting.
[11:01.700 --> 11:03.740]  You'll see there's a little bit of a gap
[11:03.740 --> 11:06.020]  between the number of processor applications
[11:06.020 --> 11:07.220]  that have been submitted
[11:07.220 --> 11:10.460]  and then the number that have been approved.
[11:10.460 --> 11:14.460]  The main reason for that gap is just waiting
[11:14.460 --> 11:17.500]  on the applicant to submit all of their requirements.
[11:17.500 --> 11:20.500]  And usually the GMP audit is the last thing
[11:20.500 --> 11:22.260]  that a processor will do.
[11:22.260 --> 11:26.220]  So unlike some of the licenses in the medical program
[11:26.220 --> 11:27.980]  or the adult use program,
[11:27.980 --> 11:31.060]  our hemp licenses aren't competitive.
[11:31.060 --> 11:34.100]  I mean, if you meet the requirements of the license,
[11:34.100 --> 11:36.100]  you'll be able to get the license.
[11:36.100 --> 11:40.500]  So the way we have structured the application
[11:40.500 --> 11:44.860]  is you actually get your facility, you get your GMP audit
[11:44.860 --> 11:49.020]  and then you can apply and receive that final license.
[11:49.020 --> 11:51.260]  So it's not like a thing
[11:51.260 --> 11:53.260]  where you're first provisionally approved
[11:53.260 --> 11:54.820]  and then you go find your location
[11:54.820 --> 11:56.740]  and then you write all your SLPs.
[11:56.740 --> 11:59.340]  It's one of those things where it's when it's up and running
[11:59.340 --> 12:01.980]  then it's ready to receive a license.
[12:01.980 --> 12:04.620]  And then just quickly on the distributor permit,
[12:04.620 --> 12:09.180]  that's only required for people who are selling products
[12:09.180 --> 12:11.980]  into New York State to retailers
[12:11.980 --> 12:14.180]  that were manufactured out of state.
[12:14.180 --> 12:16.860]  And that is just our way to kind of keep track
[12:16.860 --> 12:18.940]  of the different cannabinoid hemp products
[12:19.820 --> 12:21.020]  that are being transported
[12:21.020 --> 12:23.060]  and distributed into New York State.
[12:23.060 --> 12:24.140]  Because as we all know,
[12:24.140 --> 12:26.380]  there is a patchwork of laws out there
[12:26.380 --> 12:28.260]  as it relates to CBD now.
[12:28.260 --> 12:31.020]  A lot of states have kind of followed the New York model
[12:31.020 --> 12:33.860]  and have their own specific cannabinoid hemp programs
[12:33.860 --> 12:35.660]  and they all have different requirements,
[12:35.660 --> 12:36.820]  different testing standards,
[12:36.820 --> 12:38.420]  different packaging and labeling.
[12:38.420 --> 12:41.580]  So it's kind of our way of keeping track
[12:41.580 --> 12:44.700]  of which products are coming into the state
[12:44.700 --> 12:47.140]  and trying to make sure that they meet the requirements
[12:47.140 --> 12:49.100]  of the New York State program.
[12:51.620 --> 12:55.740]  So one update here that is kind of related
[12:55.740 --> 12:58.380]  to the hemp program, but not directly,
[12:58.380 --> 13:02.100]  is we have started issuing conditional cultivator licenses
[13:02.100 --> 13:04.740]  on the adult use side.
[13:04.740 --> 13:09.180]  So a bill passed earlier in February of this year
[13:09.180 --> 13:13.100]  that would essentially, that authorized hemp farmers
[13:13.100 --> 13:15.420]  who had grown under the Ag and Markets program
[13:15.420 --> 13:18.340]  for two of the last four years,
[13:18.340 --> 13:22.500]  the opportunity to apply for and receive a license
[13:22.500 --> 13:25.940]  to grow the first adult use cannabis
[13:25.940 --> 13:28.940]  that has been grown legally in New York State ever.
[13:31.380 --> 13:33.620]  So that was really exciting.
[13:33.620 --> 13:35.620]  We've launched that application.
[13:35.620 --> 13:38.300]  The application actually has since closed.
[13:38.300 --> 13:43.060]  I think we received over 300 or so applications.
[13:43.060 --> 13:47.780]  We've licensed 223 conditional cultivators.
[13:47.780 --> 13:49.340]  They're all throughout the state,
[13:49.340 --> 13:52.940]  from Long Island to Western New York to the North country,
[13:53.940 --> 13:57.180]  and a lot of different backgrounds from these hemp farmers,
[13:57.180 --> 13:58.980]  as kind of Tim was alluding to.
[13:58.980 --> 14:03.220]  Some are experienced farmers who grow 10 other crops
[14:03.220 --> 14:04.980]  and this is just kind of one more thing
[14:04.980 --> 14:07.780]  they're adding to their farm operations.
[14:07.780 --> 14:10.340]  And some are completely new to it.
[14:10.340 --> 14:12.620]  They're focusing on cannabis.
[14:13.180 --> 14:16.340]  They might have experience growing in other locations
[14:16.340 --> 14:17.900]  or their own location,
[14:17.900 --> 14:19.420]  but it's been really interesting
[14:19.420 --> 14:21.460]  to see that program roll out.
[14:21.460 --> 14:25.060]  And it's exciting because if we waited
[14:25.060 --> 14:28.060]  for all our regulations and for the licensing system
[14:28.060 --> 14:29.380]  to be up and running,
[14:29.380 --> 14:34.180]  we never would have been able to have outdoor grown hemp
[14:34.180 --> 14:37.220]  this year, just because of New York's climate.
[14:37.220 --> 14:39.380]  So that's really why the conditional program
[14:39.380 --> 14:41.380]  was so important to get started.
[14:42.660 --> 14:46.380]  And then similarly, that same bill that passed in February
[14:46.380 --> 14:49.540]  also allows for conditional processors.
[14:49.540 --> 14:52.260]  We're actually going to be licensing our first batch
[14:52.260 --> 14:53.580]  of conditional processors
[14:53.580 --> 14:57.660]  at the next Cannabis Control Board meeting, which is Monday.
[14:57.660 --> 14:59.020]  So that'll be exciting.
[14:59.020 --> 15:02.220]  That'll be one more kind of step in the supply chain
[15:02.220 --> 15:03.860]  to making sure that we have,
[15:03.860 --> 15:06.220]  we'll be able to get product up and running
[15:06.220 --> 15:08.900]  for when we do launch the adult use market.
[15:09.740 --> 15:13.060]  This conditional processor license is only available
[15:13.060 --> 15:16.220]  to entities that have a license
[15:16.220 --> 15:18.220]  in the cannabinoid hemp program
[15:18.220 --> 15:20.460]  and are licensed by the office
[15:20.460 --> 15:25.460]  and have applied for that license prior to January 1, 2022.
[15:25.780 --> 15:28.020]  So that was just kind of to prevent everyone
[15:28.020 --> 15:30.140]  who wants to participate in adult use
[15:30.140 --> 15:32.940]  from all of a sudden getting a hemp license
[15:32.940 --> 15:35.060]  and then being eligible for this.
[15:35.060 --> 15:37.700]  And we just wanted to have some control
[15:37.700 --> 15:39.700]  over how many applications we got
[15:39.700 --> 15:42.860]  for this initial go around.
[15:42.860 --> 15:44.820]  And I also want to highlight too
[15:44.820 --> 15:46.940]  that this is very much the beginning.
[15:46.940 --> 15:50.220]  This is not the only cultivator
[15:50.220 --> 15:53.500]  or processor licenses we're going to be issuing.
[15:53.500 --> 15:55.780]  This really, this whole conditional program
[15:55.780 --> 15:57.700]  that we're launching was really just done
[15:57.700 --> 16:00.940]  in a way to essentially jumpstart everything
[16:00.940 --> 16:02.220]  that we need to get done
[16:02.220 --> 16:05.300]  so we can launch the adult use market quicker.
[16:05.300 --> 16:08.500]  Because one thing that is,
[16:08.500 --> 16:11.020]  at least it's become painfully aware to me
[16:11.020 --> 16:13.220]  is the regulatory process,
[16:13.220 --> 16:15.300]  like following all of the state
[16:15.300 --> 16:17.180]  administrative procedure rules
[16:17.180 --> 16:19.980]  and issuing regulations out for public comment,
[16:19.980 --> 16:23.780]  soliciting those comments, responding with feedback,
[16:23.780 --> 16:25.180]  reissuing the regulations
[16:25.180 --> 16:27.380]  for a second public comment period,
[16:27.380 --> 16:30.900]  waiting for that public comment period to end.
[16:30.900 --> 16:34.580]  That whole process can take six, seven, eight months.
[16:34.580 --> 16:39.580]  So, we really, this was a very innovative idea
[16:41.020 --> 16:43.380]  for the governor to launch this program
[16:43.380 --> 16:47.140]  and get us, hopefully get the adult use market
[16:47.140 --> 16:50.020]  launched a lot quicker than would have been done.
[16:51.220 --> 16:53.140]  And also there's more information online
[16:53.140 --> 16:54.780]  for both the conditional cultivator,
[16:54.780 --> 16:57.140]  conditional processor and conditional
[16:57.140 --> 17:00.140]  or cannabinoid hemp program on our website,
[17:00.140 --> 17:02.780]  some FAQs, guidance documents, stuff like that.
[17:02.780 --> 17:04.940]  So, if you want more information,
[17:04.940 --> 17:06.860]  please feel free to reach out there
[17:08.260 --> 17:09.980]  or reach out to our office directly.
[17:09.980 --> 17:13.020]  There should be some contact information on the website.
[17:13.020 --> 17:16.700]  And I also share that with Larry and the Cornell team
[17:16.700 --> 17:18.300]  in case there's any follow-ups.
[17:19.260 --> 17:21.220]  But quickly too, I just wanted to provide
[17:21.220 --> 17:22.940]  a couple updates and next steps
[17:22.940 --> 17:25.020]  from some things that are popping up
[17:25.020 --> 17:26.700]  and are maybe front of mind
[17:27.540 --> 17:31.580]  in this summer we find ourselves in.
[17:31.580 --> 17:34.940]  So, one is if anyone's following legalization
[17:34.940 --> 17:39.940]  at the federal level, Senator Schumer and Booker and Wyden
[17:40.260 --> 17:43.660]  just released their draft of the Cannabis Administration
[17:43.660 --> 17:44.860]  and Opportunity Act.
[17:44.860 --> 17:47.380]  So, essentially their bill to legalize cannabis
[17:47.380 --> 17:48.660]  at the federal level.
[17:48.660 --> 17:50.900]  And there's some really important things in there
[17:50.900 --> 17:52.100]  as it relates to hemp.
[17:52.100 --> 17:56.740]  And I think where at least the legislators are thinking
[17:56.740 --> 17:59.980]  where hemp is going and it could also influence
[17:59.980 --> 18:01.620]  what the next farm bill will be,
[18:01.620 --> 18:03.900]  which we're already hearing a lot of conversation
[18:03.900 --> 18:08.900]  about addressing hemp in the 2023 farm bill.
[18:09.340 --> 18:11.460]  So, some things in that legislation
[18:11.460 --> 18:14.740]  that quickly stood out to me was one,
[18:14.740 --> 18:19.260]  raising the THC content allowed in hemp up to 0.7.
[18:19.260 --> 18:22.820]  It's not entirely clear why 0.7 was chosen
[18:22.820 --> 18:25.220]  rather than 1%, which I know the industry
[18:25.220 --> 18:29.060]  has been lobbying at or just keeping it at 0.3%.
[18:29.220 --> 18:31.460]  So, that was interesting.
[18:31.460 --> 18:36.100]  But, and also they seem to be proposing the Canada model
[18:36.100 --> 18:38.220]  for cannabinoid hemp products.
[18:38.220 --> 18:41.780]  So, essentially what Canada has done
[18:41.780 --> 18:46.780]  is they've allowed cannabinoid hemp products to be sold,
[18:47.580 --> 18:51.060]  but they're lumping them in with adult use products
[18:51.060 --> 18:55.180]  and medical cannabis products by setting the THC limit
[18:55.180 --> 18:58.500]  allowed to be in those products really low,
[18:59.260 --> 19:02.140]  I think it's like 10 parts per million,
[19:02.140 --> 19:05.820]  which is what's in the Schumer legislation.
[19:05.820 --> 19:07.940]  So, what this would do would essentially be,
[19:07.940 --> 19:10.460]  if you have any THC at all in a tincture,
[19:10.460 --> 19:12.220]  a food product, a beverage product,
[19:12.220 --> 19:14.860]  it would actually fall under the cannabis regulations
[19:14.860 --> 19:16.620]  rather than the hemp regulations.
[19:16.620 --> 19:19.260]  So, I'm expecting there's gonna be a lot of feedback
[19:19.260 --> 19:21.860]  from industry on that, but it's also,
[19:21.860 --> 19:24.580]  it's an interesting idea because after all,
[19:24.580 --> 19:27.060]  a lot of the problems we deal with in our office
[19:27.060 --> 19:29.420]  relate to how much THC is in a product
[19:29.420 --> 19:32.460]  and trying to make sure that the products sold
[19:32.460 --> 19:35.660]  in the cannabinoid hemp program are non-intoxicating
[19:35.660 --> 19:37.460]  while the intoxicating products
[19:37.460 --> 19:40.020]  with the additional bells and whistles and regulations
[19:40.020 --> 19:42.620]  would be more appropriately sold through the adult use
[19:42.620 --> 19:44.580]  in the medical cannabis markets.
[19:44.580 --> 19:49.340]  And that leads to Delta-8 THC, which it's been a big one.
[19:49.340 --> 19:51.980]  Just a quick highlight there that we have prohibited
[19:51.980 --> 19:55.540]  Delta-8 THC in the cannabinoid hemp program.
[19:55.540 --> 19:58.700]  It will most likely be allowed in the adult use program
[19:58.700 --> 20:02.220]  and is also allowed right now in our medical program,
[20:02.220 --> 20:04.540]  but just because of the intoxicating nature,
[20:04.540 --> 20:06.540]  we're trying to kind of keep those types of products
[20:06.540 --> 20:09.220]  out of cannabinoid hemp markets.
[20:09.220 --> 20:12.380]  And then farmer's markets, we get a lot of questions
[20:12.380 --> 20:15.260]  of can I sell cannabinoid hemp products
[20:15.260 --> 20:16.740]  at a farmer's market?
[20:16.740 --> 20:18.500]  The answer is yes.
[20:18.500 --> 20:23.500]  However, the obligation to get a retail license to do so
[20:24.380 --> 20:26.380]  is a requirement.
[20:26.380 --> 20:29.900]  So if you have a retail license already
[20:29.900 --> 20:32.460]  for cannabinoid hemp products that you sell,
[20:32.460 --> 20:36.460]  either online, just bringing that documentation
[20:36.460 --> 20:40.220]  or having that included when you set up at a farmer's market
[20:40.220 --> 20:43.620]  will count now in terms of a retail license
[20:43.620 --> 20:45.980]  for those operations.
[20:45.980 --> 20:49.780]  And then lastly, just a quick note, since legalization,
[20:49.780 --> 20:51.300]  I don't know if anyone's noticed,
[20:51.300 --> 20:54.660]  but a lot of these gifting stores have been popping up
[20:54.660 --> 20:57.580]  since cannabis has been decriminalized.
[20:57.580 --> 21:00.340]  It's not an enforcement priority for law enforcement,
[21:00.340 --> 21:02.020]  which is a really good thing.
[21:02.020 --> 21:06.620]  However, I wanna make it clear that our office
[21:06.620 --> 21:09.620]  has not licensed any adult use sales to date.
[21:09.620 --> 21:11.780]  So any of these stores, any of these places
[21:11.780 --> 21:14.580]  selling these products are not legal.
[21:14.580 --> 21:16.420]  They're not authorized by the office.
[21:16.420 --> 21:19.780]  They're not, their products aren't being tested.
[21:19.780 --> 21:21.780]  There's often labeling concerns.
[21:21.780 --> 21:24.540]  They're often marketed towards children
[21:24.540 --> 21:27.540]  with neon colors and bright stuff.
[21:27.540 --> 21:32.020]  So very much, please be aware when you're,
[21:32.020 --> 21:35.980]  if you do choose to go to one of those locations
[21:35.980 --> 21:37.300]  that you don't really know
[21:37.300 --> 21:38.980]  where these products are coming from.
[21:38.980 --> 21:40.980]  Our office is taking a number of actions
[21:40.980 --> 21:43.380]  trying to shut them down
[21:43.380 --> 21:47.100]  while we also simultaneously license products
[21:47.100 --> 21:51.420]  because these will just hurt the illicit market
[21:51.420 --> 21:53.540]  that we're trying to establish.
[21:53.540 --> 21:55.780]  So I kinda just wanted to highlight that one.
[21:56.740 --> 22:00.300]  And that kinda is where we are right now.
[22:00.300 --> 22:02.540]  There's a lot going on.
[22:02.540 --> 22:05.220]  We're hiring folks routinely.
[22:05.220 --> 22:07.580]  So if you're interested in a career
[22:07.580 --> 22:09.860]  or know someone who might be, please check our website.
[22:09.860 --> 22:13.900]  There's a jobs tab where you can see opportunities
[22:14.220 --> 22:15.380]  for careers.
[22:15.380 --> 22:17.820]  And we are looking forward
[22:17.820 --> 22:19.780]  to launching the adult use program,
[22:19.780 --> 22:21.940]  bolstering up the cannabinoid hemp program,
[22:21.940 --> 22:24.500]  and then also making the medical cannabis program
[22:24.500 --> 22:27.500]  more accessible for patients and practitioners.
[22:27.500 --> 22:29.660]  Just a real quick highlight on that.
[22:29.660 --> 22:33.100]  We did recently release proposed regulations
[22:33.100 --> 22:35.660]  which would actually get rid of the registration requirement
[22:35.660 --> 22:37.580]  for our medical program.
[22:37.580 --> 22:42.580]  So once someone would be just authorized by their physician
[22:43.500 --> 22:45.620]  to use medical cannabis,
[22:45.620 --> 22:47.580]  they wouldn't have to then go to our office
[22:47.580 --> 22:51.100]  and get registered, excuse me,
[22:51.100 --> 22:53.060]  just trying to make it easier
[22:53.060 --> 22:55.500]  to essentially be a medical cannabis patient
[22:55.500 --> 22:58.860]  in the light that an adult use market is coming.
[22:58.860 --> 23:01.860]  And we wanna make sure that that medical market exists
[23:01.860 --> 23:04.060]  because sometimes it does make sense
[23:04.060 --> 23:05.860]  for someone to use cannabis
[23:05.860 --> 23:08.900]  with a practitioner's oversight, getting that feedback.
[23:08.900 --> 23:10.460]  They might be taking other medications.
[23:10.460 --> 23:12.220]  They might have questions about dosing.
[23:12.860 --> 23:16.540]  And so there's a lot of pros to being in the medical program
[23:16.540 --> 23:19.980]  even in the existence of an adult use market.
[23:19.980 --> 23:20.820]  So thank you.
[23:20.820 --> 23:22.540]  Please check out our website
[23:22.540 --> 23:26.380]  and email us at any of the many emails that we have.
[23:26.380 --> 23:29.460]  And we will try and be as responsive as possible.
[23:29.460 --> 23:31.900]  And I'm open for some questions if we have time.
[23:34.740 --> 23:36.420]  Thanks very much, Pat.
[23:36.420 --> 23:38.700]  Unfortunately, we are out of time.
[23:38.700 --> 23:41.100]  So to ask Pat questions.
[23:41.940 --> 23:43.900]  So hopefully you snapped a picture
[23:43.900 --> 23:46.220]  of all of those contacts there.
[23:46.220 --> 23:49.620]  And I'm sure, I know they're very busy at OCM
[23:49.620 --> 23:51.140]  and Pat is incredibly busy,
[23:51.140 --> 23:55.260]  but I'm sure they will get back to you when time allows.
[23:55.260 --> 23:58.380]  So please join me in thanking Pat again
[23:58.380 --> 23:59.580]  with a round of applause.
[23:59.580 --> 24:00.420]  Thank you.
[24:06.600 --> 24:10.040]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[24:10.040 --> 24:12.920]  on the web at cornell.edu.
[24:14.480 --> 24:15.320]  Thank you.
