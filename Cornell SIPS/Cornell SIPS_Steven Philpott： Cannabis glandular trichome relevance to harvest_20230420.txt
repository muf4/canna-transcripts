[00:00.000 --> 00:07.990]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.990 --> 00:09.790]  OK, hi, everyone.
[00:09.790 --> 00:12.950]  Welcome to the 2023 HEMP webinar series.
[00:12.950 --> 00:14.070]  My name is Luis Monserrate.
[00:14.070 --> 00:16.710]  I'm a second year PhD student in plant breeding and genetics
[00:16.710 --> 00:19.430]  in Larry's Mons Lab at Cornell University.
[00:19.430 --> 00:23.430]  And once again, I'm accompanied by Tony Baracco, Cornell alum,
[00:23.430 --> 00:25.830]  who has assisted me with this webinar series,
[00:25.830 --> 00:29.430]  as well as Gemma and Kim, who have provided this digital
[00:29.430 --> 00:32.150]  platform for us, the webinar series.
[00:32.150 --> 00:36.230]  Lastly, I just want to mention that this webinar series is
[00:36.230 --> 00:38.430]  a component of a larger project, which
[00:38.430 --> 00:41.390]  is the development of eight educational modules that
[00:41.390 --> 00:43.990]  will be freely available on the Cornell HEMP website
[00:43.990 --> 00:45.990]  at the end of the webinar series.
[00:45.990 --> 00:48.270]  Each module will have the recorded webinar,
[00:48.270 --> 00:50.070]  the instructional slide deck, and a set
[00:50.070 --> 00:52.670]  of high impact papers pertaining to the respective subject.
[00:52.670 --> 00:54.990]  For instance, for this subject, or for this module,
[00:54.990 --> 00:58.350]  that will be on hemp harvest.
[00:58.350 --> 01:00.990]  All webinars and recordings of them
[01:00.990 --> 01:04.470]  will be available on the Cornell SIPS YouTube channel.
[01:04.470 --> 01:07.230]  So if you're interested in re-watching them or sharing
[01:07.230 --> 01:09.910]  them with somebody else that couldn't attend on a specific
[01:09.910 --> 01:11.510]  day.
[01:11.510 --> 01:15.190]  So with that, it is my pleasure to introduce Stephen Philpott.
[01:15.190 --> 01:19.590]  He is a Marine Corps veteran and a current environmental
[01:19.590 --> 01:22.190]  biological science graduate researcher at Chicago State
[01:22.190 --> 01:23.310]  University.
[01:23.310 --> 01:25.070]  And his talk today is going to be
[01:25.070 --> 01:29.230]  on cannabis glandular trichome relevance to harvest.
[01:29.270 --> 01:31.510]  So with that, Steve, please take it away.
[01:33.990 --> 01:34.510]  Hi, Luis.
[01:34.510 --> 01:35.230]  Yeah.
[01:35.230 --> 01:36.510]  Thank you for the introduction.
[01:36.510 --> 01:37.910]  I appreciate that.
[01:37.910 --> 01:39.790]  Thank you to Cornell for hosting this platform
[01:39.790 --> 01:43.870]  and for being featured among the other featured speakers.
[01:43.870 --> 01:44.390]  Awesome.
[01:44.390 --> 01:47.350]  So today, I'm going to be talking about cannabis glandular
[01:47.350 --> 01:48.070]  trichomes.
[01:48.070 --> 01:50.470]  I know a lot of us have heard of them
[01:50.470 --> 01:53.510]  and are familiar with them as a more broad topic.
[01:53.510 --> 01:58.190]  But I just want to talk more about these glandular trichomes,
[01:58.190 --> 01:59.990]  why they're relevant to harvest,
[01:59.990 --> 02:01.630]  how the information that we know now,
[02:01.630 --> 02:03.110]  some information that's coming out.
[02:03.110 --> 02:06.110]  And then I want to talk about some of my work
[02:06.110 --> 02:11.830]  and why it may be relevant to any producers that are
[02:11.830 --> 02:13.750]  cultivating floral cannabis.
[02:13.750 --> 02:16.470]  And we'll talk about some of those differences.
[02:16.470 --> 02:20.310]  To dive straight in, so everybody's
[02:20.310 --> 02:21.910]  familiar with a lot of the policy.
[02:21.910 --> 02:24.030]  But I just want to make it clear.
[02:24.030 --> 02:26.750]  All of the, when I say cannabis used in my research,
[02:27.030 --> 02:29.030]  was federally compliant hemp.
[02:29.030 --> 02:33.390]  These were all state approved hemp cultivars.
[02:33.390 --> 02:37.470]  So one of the reasons that we obviously had to use hemp
[02:37.470 --> 02:39.230]  is because of the DEA Schedule 1 status
[02:39.230 --> 02:40.430]  and we do not have a license.
[02:40.430 --> 02:42.310]  So just want to make that clear.
[02:42.310 --> 02:45.470]  But I do want to talk about some of the discrepancies
[02:45.470 --> 02:48.750]  because this is relevant to farmers that are looking
[02:48.750 --> 02:52.750]  to learn more about harvesting.
[02:52.750 --> 02:56.710]  The DEA Schedule 1 status changes a lot of our ability
[02:56.710 --> 03:00.590]  to do research on obviously hemp and drug type
[03:00.590 --> 03:07.030]  or above 0.3% THC cannabis marijuana.
[03:07.030 --> 03:08.870]  The research gridlock, as I call it,
[03:08.870 --> 03:11.350]  is kind of a contradiction that has kind of slowed down
[03:11.350 --> 03:13.070]  research for a while.
[03:13.070 --> 03:15.190]  The DEA has a schedule saying that there's
[03:15.190 --> 03:17.790]  no current medical uses.
[03:17.790 --> 03:22.990]  But the FDA has already approved of multiple drugs.
[03:22.990 --> 03:25.470]  And when we go to policy, we hear a lot of times
[03:25.470 --> 03:26.630]  and more research is needed.
[03:26.630 --> 03:30.110]  So I hope that although this is about floral hemp,
[03:30.110 --> 03:34.270]  it can kind of be understood as more of an overall topic
[03:34.270 --> 03:37.270]  in floral cannabis as well.
[03:37.270 --> 03:39.750]  One of the reasons being is because this is,
[03:39.750 --> 03:43.150]  I took this from the USDA Plants Database Classification
[03:43.150 --> 03:45.230]  Report of 2021.
[03:45.230 --> 03:48.270]  And this was kind of how the classifications of hemp
[03:48.270 --> 03:52.310]  and marijuana are specified or classified
[03:52.310 --> 03:55.430]  on a more taxonomical basis.
[03:55.430 --> 03:56.830]  So you can see the genus.
[03:56.830 --> 04:01.230]  It says cannabis sativa L. It has this marijuana,
[04:01.230 --> 04:04.350]  but it also has hemp above that.
[04:04.350 --> 04:06.910]  And then as you move further down to these subspecies,
[04:06.910 --> 04:10.150]  you see there's cannabis sativa L subspecies sativa,
[04:10.150 --> 04:12.430]  cannabis sativa L subspecies indica.
[04:12.430 --> 04:15.470]  And I realize that this naming issue
[04:15.470 --> 04:18.030]  becomes difficult for farmers who
[04:18.030 --> 04:20.830]  are looking to find this kind of data that's
[04:20.830 --> 04:23.390]  specific to something that is more
[04:23.390 --> 04:26.310]  applicable to their end use.
[04:26.310 --> 04:29.110]  All that to say, two of the biggest issues
[04:29.110 --> 04:32.390]  when we hear things like sativa and indica,
[04:32.390 --> 04:35.150]  there are some vast assumptions that go along with this.
[04:35.150 --> 04:37.750]  And this is kind of what's relevant to harvest.
[04:37.750 --> 04:39.750]  I have experience working in a retail setting,
[04:39.750 --> 04:42.070]  and that's kind of what got me interested to really jump
[04:42.070 --> 04:43.710]  into the research.
[04:43.710 --> 04:46.390]  We would get cultivars with the same name,
[04:46.390 --> 04:48.230]  but the actual metabolite profile,
[04:48.230 --> 04:51.510]  which is what floral cannabis is typically sold for,
[04:51.510 --> 04:55.070]  it varied vastly every different time, batch to batch.
[04:55.070 --> 04:58.550]  And for people who are medical consumers,
[04:58.550 --> 05:00.350]  sometimes they would have different effects.
[05:00.350 --> 05:02.110]  So this was very important that we
[05:02.110 --> 05:04.830]  needed to look more into the consistency of the production
[05:04.830 --> 05:06.870]  of these metabolite profiles.
[05:06.870 --> 05:08.990]  Sometimes there would be little to no terpenes.
[05:08.990 --> 05:11.190]  Sometimes the cannabinoids themselves
[05:11.190 --> 05:14.870]  would be vastly different.
[05:14.870 --> 05:16.270]  The reason I bring all that up is
[05:16.270 --> 05:17.790]  because a lot of the assumptions when
[05:17.830 --> 05:19.990]  you go to a retail setting, they're
[05:19.990 --> 05:23.750]  classified as a sativa or an indica.
[05:23.750 --> 05:25.430]  And I think most of us know at this point
[05:25.430 --> 05:29.030]  that those terms don't necessarily
[05:29.030 --> 05:31.270]  correlate to the metabolites that
[05:31.270 --> 05:35.990]  are responsible for the effects that these titles have claimed.
[05:35.990 --> 05:38.070]  So the reason that I say all this
[05:38.070 --> 05:40.350]  is because the inheritance principles,
[05:40.350 --> 05:42.310]  like the basic principles for genetics,
[05:42.310 --> 05:46.070]  that wasn't something that was published until 1865.
[05:46.070 --> 05:47.830]  And Carl Linnaeus and John Baptiste Lamarck
[05:47.830 --> 05:51.030]  actually made these designations of indica and sativa
[05:51.030 --> 05:53.030]  way prior to that.
[05:53.030 --> 05:56.110]  So all that to say, these terms are
[05:56.110 --> 05:58.950]  being used incorrectly in retail settings
[05:58.950 --> 06:02.830]  when it comes to being able to describe the metabolites
[06:02.830 --> 06:07.980]  that the product is being sold for.
[06:07.980 --> 06:09.620]  So what are the big problems?
[06:09.620 --> 06:11.220]  Some of the biggest problems, I'd say,
[06:11.220 --> 06:13.700]  are a lack of federal best management practices.
[06:13.700 --> 06:15.900]  If you look up most common crops in your region,
[06:15.900 --> 06:19.460]  you can find some type of best management practices
[06:19.460 --> 06:22.860]  based on your soil makeup, based on your pH,
[06:22.860 --> 06:26.340]  based on your little microclimate where you live.
[06:26.340 --> 06:29.020]  And with cannabis, it's very difficult
[06:29.020 --> 06:31.220]  because you don't find this information publicly,
[06:31.220 --> 06:34.020]  although there are more research projects, obviously,
[06:34.020 --> 06:36.460]  coming up with agronomic data for local farmers.
[06:36.460 --> 06:40.660]  And that's why we're doing things like this.
[06:40.660 --> 06:43.860]  I say that to say that for cultivation, harvest,
[06:43.860 --> 06:48.500]  post-harvest, and storage, there is not a lot of research
[06:48.500 --> 06:51.380]  diving into trichomes and necessarily
[06:51.380 --> 06:54.020]  how the trichome density or quantity
[06:54.020 --> 06:55.820]  affect the metabolites.
[06:55.820 --> 06:59.220]  To take kind of like a 300-foot view, to take a step back,
[06:59.220 --> 07:02.540]  we base the legality off of cannabis plants.
[07:02.540 --> 07:05.580]  Hemp is below 0.3% THC.
[07:05.580 --> 07:08.820]  Marijuana is considered above 0.3% THC.
[07:08.820 --> 07:11.780]  These arbitrary definitions aren't necessarily
[07:11.780 --> 07:14.260]  benefiting cannabis cultivators who
[07:14.260 --> 07:19.580]  are cultivating for floral hemp who want to remain compliant.
[07:19.580 --> 07:22.900]  So long story short, this is really what got me interested.
[07:22.900 --> 07:24.900]  The industry standard of trichome analysis,
[07:24.900 --> 07:26.260]  as most people are familiar with,
[07:26.260 --> 07:29.180]  you'd have a light microscope, a jeweler's loop,
[07:29.180 --> 07:30.980]  a magnifying glass.
[07:30.980 --> 07:35.380]  There's typically just a visual analysis of these trichomes
[07:35.380 --> 07:37.260]  look clear, cloudy, or amber.
[07:37.260 --> 07:40.140]  Those are typically the three.
[07:40.180 --> 07:40.980]  Excuse me.
[07:40.980 --> 07:43.140]  Those are typically the three kind of physical features
[07:43.140 --> 07:44.860]  that people are looking for when they're looking at what
[07:44.860 --> 07:47.140]  people might say ripeness.
[07:47.140 --> 07:50.940]  Although that may help, that is a very subjective means
[07:50.940 --> 07:54.820]  of analyzing what the actual cannabinoid concentration is.
[07:54.820 --> 07:57.980]  At what point are you at risk for being noncompliant?
[07:57.980 --> 08:01.060]  At what point are you, should you harvest
[08:01.060 --> 08:02.420]  based on what you want?
[08:02.420 --> 08:06.060]  You know, people say 70% cloud or 30% amber.
[08:06.060 --> 08:09.500]  These are all very subjective means of analysis
[08:09.500 --> 08:12.100]  and kind of passing those on just
[08:12.100 --> 08:13.380]  makes it even more subjective.
[08:13.380 --> 08:17.340]  So long story short, I got very, very interested in trichomes
[08:17.340 --> 08:22.660]  and another means of analyzing them kind of on a deeper scale.
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.540]  The lack of insight into factors affecting
[08:24.540 --> 08:28.260]  secondary metabolite production, meaning pre- and post-harvest.
[08:28.260 --> 08:30.500]  Again, we're looking at these trichomes
[08:30.500 --> 08:33.220]  kind of with the naked eye or with the magnifying glass,
[08:33.220 --> 08:35.940]  but that is a lot different than actually homogenizing
[08:35.940 --> 08:38.060]  that sample, mixing it with the solvent,
[08:38.060 --> 08:40.180]  running it through some type of chromatography machine
[08:40.180 --> 08:43.740]  and getting the cannabinoid concentrations.
[08:43.740 --> 08:46.380]  Another issue with that is how cost effective
[08:46.380 --> 08:49.060]  is that for farmers to do that regularly?
[08:49.060 --> 08:52.140]  Can they test that week one, two, three, four?
[08:52.140 --> 08:53.740]  Can they test regularly?
[08:53.740 --> 08:56.460]  And how consistent are these tests?
[08:56.460 --> 09:00.220]  So that's, again, another risk of compliance.
[09:00.220 --> 09:02.260]  And then long story short, this entire industry
[09:02.260 --> 09:07.300]  is driven now by retail mostly, even though there are still
[09:07.300 --> 09:12.860]  medical consumers, and the demand for quality products
[09:12.860 --> 09:15.340]  is kind of an issue right now, because if you look at a lot
[09:15.340 --> 09:16.940]  of farmers, they're struggling financially
[09:16.940 --> 09:19.860]  because there's a surplus in products.
[09:19.860 --> 09:22.700]  But the quality kind of across the board, across the nation,
[09:22.700 --> 09:26.100]  as we rapidly legalize, isn't keeping up
[09:26.100 --> 09:28.540]  with this kind of rapid mass production of cannabis.
[09:28.540 --> 09:31.340]  So that's all we're talking about, trichomes
[09:31.340 --> 09:34.260]  and how they relate to harvest.
[09:34.260 --> 09:35.100]  Very simple.
[09:35.100 --> 09:37.860]  Most people know the basic life cycles of cannabis.
[09:37.860 --> 09:41.540]  You have your seed, seedling, excuse me,
[09:41.540 --> 09:44.900]  or your clone if you decide to start with propagation.
[09:44.900 --> 09:46.620]  During this phase, the plant is spending
[09:46.620 --> 09:50.140]  most of its energy and resources establishing its roots.
[09:50.140 --> 09:51.780]  During its vegetative stage, once you
[09:51.780 --> 09:55.220]  start seeing rapid and consistent growth
[09:55.220 --> 09:57.580]  and development of roots and shoots,
[09:57.580 --> 10:00.540]  you kind of have this vegetative growth going on.
[10:00.540 --> 10:03.060]  But flowering is kind of what I want to talk about today,
[10:03.060 --> 10:05.340]  because when we're talking about cannabis that's harvested
[10:05.340 --> 10:09.980]  for cannabinoid-rich or terpene-rich biomass,
[10:09.980 --> 10:12.140]  we're talking about harvesting flowers.
[10:12.140 --> 10:14.900]  That's also really important because a lot of policy
[10:14.900 --> 10:18.020]  kind of groups in fiber cannabis, grain cannabis,
[10:18.020 --> 10:21.620]  seed cannabis, and even non-flowering cannabis
[10:21.620 --> 10:23.460]  into the same group.
[10:23.460 --> 10:25.300]  And from what we know right in the literature
[10:25.300 --> 10:28.660]  is that this flowering stage is when these metabolites start
[10:28.660 --> 10:31.580]  producing and when we start seeing these trichomes
[10:31.580 --> 10:34.620]  that we're talking about.
[10:34.620 --> 10:36.420]  So this is one of my favorite images,
[10:36.420 --> 10:39.540]  and I want to kind of take a second to break it down.
[10:39.540 --> 10:41.500]  When we say we're looking at trichomes,
[10:41.500 --> 10:43.620]  we're talking about these epidermal growths.
[10:43.620 --> 10:45.900]  We're talking about what people would say
[10:45.900 --> 10:51.020]  makes cannabis look frosty or shimmery or shiny.
[10:51.020 --> 10:52.980]  There's these resin-filled glands
[10:52.980 --> 10:56.020]  that grow during flowering that provide protection
[10:56.020 --> 10:57.860]  to the outer layer of the plant.
[10:57.860 --> 10:59.740]  What's really, really interesting about these
[10:59.740 --> 11:03.620]  is that they rapidly, rapidly increase
[11:03.620 --> 11:06.900]  in their growth and development during flowering,
[11:06.900 --> 11:10.140]  but we don't necessarily know how they exactly contribute
[11:10.140 --> 11:11.580]  to the cannabinoid concentrations
[11:11.580 --> 11:13.340]  that we're seeing in the test.
[11:13.340 --> 11:15.300]  It's a lot different to test, you know,
[11:15.300 --> 11:17.980]  maybe something called KEEF, which is isolated trichomes,
[11:17.980 --> 11:22.220]  versus testing an entire, like picture A here,
[11:22.220 --> 11:24.300]  what we call an entire complete inflorescence
[11:24.300 --> 11:27.420]  where there's stalks, there's leaves, there's flowers,
[11:27.420 --> 11:29.060]  and maybe not all of these pieces
[11:29.060 --> 11:31.660]  have the same coverage of trichomes,
[11:31.660 --> 11:34.940]  meaning that they potentially have different metabolites
[11:34.940 --> 11:38.420]  even in locations that are close to each other.
[11:38.420 --> 11:40.620]  Image B is one individual calyx
[11:40.620 --> 11:42.220]  underneath the light microscope.
[11:43.180 --> 11:45.300]  It's actually the bract that's covering the calyx.
[11:45.300 --> 11:46.540]  If you look at the very top,
[11:46.540 --> 11:51.100]  you can see these orange style that are protruding out
[11:51.100 --> 11:53.420]  that would catch pollen on a live plant
[11:54.300 --> 11:55.860]  if it was to be pollinated.
[11:55.860 --> 11:57.860]  Like most of us know,
[11:57.860 --> 11:59.460]  floral cannabis, we typically don't, right?
[11:59.460 --> 12:02.060]  We don't want it pollinated so those seeds produce.
[12:02.060 --> 12:03.260]  We want those trichomes
[12:03.260 --> 12:06.100]  to continue producing secondary metabolites
[12:06.100 --> 12:09.500]  until whatever point the cultivator or farmer decides,
[12:09.500 --> 12:12.740]  hey, this is what I want to go ahead and harvest.
[12:12.740 --> 12:16.420]  Image C is what I've actually analyzed in my research.
[12:16.420 --> 12:18.980]  So most of the time when we do testing,
[12:18.980 --> 12:21.660]  it's, we say we homogenize the sample, right?
[12:21.660 --> 12:23.500]  So we kind of take that sample A
[12:24.340 --> 12:26.220]  with the leaves, with the stalks,
[12:26.220 --> 12:27.620]  and also with the calyx,
[12:27.620 --> 12:30.020]  and we would kind of crush it all together
[12:30.020 --> 12:31.700]  and we would analyze that sample.
[12:31.700 --> 12:34.180]  What's really interesting is something that,
[12:34.180 --> 12:35.900]  you know, is already in other researches
[12:35.900 --> 12:39.060]  that the trichomes, the glandular trichomes
[12:39.060 --> 12:41.460]  don't develop at the same density
[12:41.460 --> 12:42.940]  or quantity at every location.
[12:42.940 --> 12:46.140]  And if you look at Image C, it's pretty easy to tell that.
[12:47.660 --> 12:50.060]  If you look at the red arrow, that's going to be a bract.
[12:50.060 --> 12:52.700]  So that's what's actually that protective specialized leaf
[12:52.700 --> 12:54.300]  that's covering that calyx.
[12:54.300 --> 12:56.420]  And then if you look in this really,
[12:56.420 --> 12:58.180]  really trichome dense area,
[12:58.180 --> 13:00.180]  and when we're talking about trichomes,
[13:00.180 --> 13:01.580]  you'll be able to notice them obviously
[13:01.580 --> 13:03.620]  because of these circular heads,
[13:03.620 --> 13:05.380]  they almost don't fit in.
[13:05.380 --> 13:07.220]  They look very intentionally built.
[13:07.220 --> 13:12.220]  But this section that where the, excuse me,
[13:12.220 --> 13:14.780]  where the green arrow is pointing
[13:14.780 --> 13:16.460]  is covered in glandular trichomes,
[13:16.460 --> 13:17.940]  and that's going to be our calyx.
[13:17.940 --> 13:19.460]  And then if you look over to the right,
[13:19.460 --> 13:21.260]  the blue is actually the base of, again,
[13:21.940 --> 13:24.460]  what you see is that orange stigma sticking out of it
[13:24.460 --> 13:27.100]  and that Image B.
[13:27.100 --> 13:29.820]  And the Image D is going to be zoomed in.
[13:29.820 --> 13:32.340]  This is really where I do a lot of my work
[13:32.340 --> 13:34.820]  so that I can look at the morphological differences
[13:34.820 --> 13:37.020]  between different trichomes.
[13:37.020 --> 13:39.620]  I'll start with this yellow arrow at the top on Image D
[13:39.620 --> 13:40.820]  all the way to the right.
[13:40.820 --> 13:42.820]  That's going to be a non-glandular trichome.
[13:42.820 --> 13:46.980]  So these trichomes don't produce secondary metabolites.
[13:46.980 --> 13:48.940]  These trichomes are more of a physical barrier.
[13:48.940 --> 13:51.340]  Honestly, I like to think of them as,
[13:51.340 --> 13:52.820]  if you ever see they put the spikes
[13:52.820 --> 13:54.940]  on top of a doorway sometimes
[13:54.940 --> 13:57.380]  so birds don't just hang out there.
[13:57.380 --> 14:00.020]  I like to think of those non-glandular trichomes
[14:00.020 --> 14:02.220]  as these physical barriers.
[14:02.220 --> 14:05.380]  Whereas this red arrow, this blue arrow,
[14:05.380 --> 14:08.740]  and this green arrow, these are all glandular trichomes.
[14:08.740 --> 14:10.180]  And we're going to talk about the different types
[14:10.180 --> 14:12.100]  of glandular trichomes, some of the differences
[14:12.100 --> 14:14.180]  and things of that nature.
[14:14.180 --> 14:17.180]  But these trichomes are where the secondary metabolites
[14:17.180 --> 14:18.020]  are produced.
[14:18.020 --> 14:19.100]  And I really want to take a second.
[14:19.100 --> 14:20.500]  So everybody, we all know this,
[14:20.500 --> 14:22.100]  but sometimes we rush past it.
[14:23.140 --> 14:25.660]  A lot of this floral or biomass material
[14:25.660 --> 14:27.180]  when we're running tests,
[14:27.180 --> 14:30.140]  when we're actually analyzing for cannabinoid concentrations,
[14:30.140 --> 14:31.980]  we're not necessarily looking for that.
[14:31.980 --> 14:33.900]  Most of us, if you think about it,
[14:33.900 --> 14:36.700]  we're looking to quantify the metabolites
[14:36.700 --> 14:39.740]  that are produced and stored in the glandular heads
[14:40.700 --> 14:43.860]  of these glandular trichomes.
[14:43.860 --> 14:46.580]  The red arrow is going to be a stothlangular trichome.
[14:46.580 --> 14:49.660]  The word before the glandular is usually what tells you
[14:49.660 --> 14:52.020]  where the position is or the morphology.
[14:52.020 --> 14:55.820]  So stothlangular trichome is self-explanatory.
[14:55.820 --> 14:58.100]  There's a large stalk that actually raises
[14:58.100 --> 15:00.860]  the glandular head above the surface.
[15:00.860 --> 15:02.740]  You'll see sessile glandular trichomes,
[15:02.740 --> 15:05.940]  which can be similar or close to the same size
[15:05.940 --> 15:07.660]  as stothlangular trichomes.
[15:08.540 --> 15:12.140]  The difference is that sessile actually means like resting.
[15:12.140 --> 15:14.340]  Sessile is similar to, when you think sessile,
[15:14.340 --> 15:18.700]  think like a barnacle on a whale or stuck to the shore.
[15:18.700 --> 15:21.860]  So these are glandular heads that are resting directly
[15:21.860 --> 15:23.260]  on top of the surface.
[15:23.260 --> 15:25.500]  And then the third type and the lesser known
[15:25.500 --> 15:28.540]  and less researched type is bulbous glandular trichomes,
[15:28.540 --> 15:31.620]  which is really, really small trichomes.
[15:34.920 --> 15:37.800]  Again, just to kind of go over what I just said,
[15:37.800 --> 15:40.120]  this is an image that has artificial coloring
[15:40.120 --> 15:43.640]  just to make it a little easier to process the differences.
[15:43.640 --> 15:46.720]  Again, if you look at this red arrow over here,
[15:46.720 --> 15:48.520]  you're gonna have this style again,
[15:48.520 --> 15:50.680]  which would catch pollen if you were breeding
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.600]  or open pollination to pollinate this female cannabis plant.
[15:55.600 --> 15:56.800]  You have your green arrow here,
[15:56.800 --> 15:58.480]  which is your non-glandular trichome,
[15:58.480 --> 16:00.400]  those physical barriers.
[16:00.400 --> 16:03.080]  Yellow being these short bulbous trichomes.
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.240]  And then this blue arrow, again, a sessile glandular trichome.
[16:08.240 --> 16:10.680]  The biggest difference between these glandular trichomes,
[16:10.680 --> 16:13.280]  which produce metabolites within each other
[16:13.960 --> 16:16.200]  is they have specialized cells that are made
[16:16.200 --> 16:18.800]  for the synthesis and the storage of these metabolites.
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.040]  So again, to kind of make this relevant,
[16:22.040 --> 16:23.920]  these glandular trichomes that we're looking at,
[16:23.920 --> 16:26.600]  this is where we are finding the highest concentrations
[16:26.600 --> 16:29.200]  of cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids.
[16:30.040 --> 16:31.600]  What's really interesting about the differences
[16:31.600 --> 16:34.560]  is the gland size is the first thing
[16:34.560 --> 16:36.280]  that you can obviously see.
[16:36.280 --> 16:38.080]  Sessile and stalk glandular trichomes
[16:38.080 --> 16:39.320]  can have similar sized head,
[16:39.320 --> 16:42.840]  while bulbous trichomes are much, much smaller.
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.960]  The actual cell count in the head of the gland,
[16:45.960 --> 16:48.840]  and then obviously whether it has a stalk or no stalk,
[16:48.840 --> 16:52.920]  just strictly applying to stalk glandular trichomes.
[16:52.920 --> 16:54.760]  One other interesting thing that's come out of research
[16:54.760 --> 16:59.040]  is that there is a monoterpene to sesculterpene
[16:59.040 --> 17:01.920]  difference between sessile glandular trichomes
[17:01.920 --> 17:03.920]  and stalk glandular trichomes,
[17:03.920 --> 17:05.200]  with stalk glandular trichomes
[17:05.200 --> 17:07.920]  having a more monoterpene dominant profile
[17:07.920 --> 17:09.280]  and sessile glandular trichomes
[17:09.280 --> 17:10.720]  having a more sessile glandular,
[17:10.720 --> 17:14.040]  or sessile, or sesculterpene dominant profile.
[17:15.920 --> 17:17.040]  Again, what's really important
[17:17.040 --> 17:18.600]  before we kind of move into the research
[17:18.600 --> 17:20.680]  is the purpose of these trichomes
[17:20.680 --> 17:23.560]  is not to produce for you as a human.
[17:23.560 --> 17:25.440]  The purpose is for this living organism,
[17:25.440 --> 17:28.080]  which is a sexually mature female plant
[17:28.080 --> 17:29.920]  awaiting reproduction and pollination
[17:29.920 --> 17:32.280]  to produce these molecules
[17:32.280 --> 17:33.720]  in response to their environment
[17:33.720 --> 17:37.760]  based on combination of genetics, nutrients and environment.
[17:37.760 --> 17:40.080]  But that doesn't always mean that every part of the plant
[17:40.080 --> 17:43.560]  is doing this evenly or even consistently.
[17:43.560 --> 17:46.760]  So something that was really interesting,
[17:46.760 --> 17:48.600]  I was an adjunct professor at a community college
[17:48.600 --> 17:51.320]  and it was really interesting to kind of teach
[17:51.320 --> 17:53.560]  the natural morphology of cannabis plants.
[17:53.560 --> 17:56.480]  I think you hear so many trimming and training techniques
[17:56.480 --> 17:59.040]  that people forget cannabis kind of naturally grows
[17:59.040 --> 18:00.640]  like a Christmas tree and not literally,
[18:00.640 --> 18:03.120]  but obviously it's wider at the bottom
[18:03.120 --> 18:04.520]  and then it's more narrow at the top
[18:04.520 --> 18:06.960]  focusing most of its energy at the top
[18:06.960 --> 18:09.560]  or apical meristem where a circle is.
[18:09.560 --> 18:12.040]  Dr. Bernstein said something really awesome last week
[18:12.040 --> 18:13.200]  and I'm glad she kind of said it
[18:13.200 --> 18:15.640]  and I want to preface that is that
[18:15.640 --> 18:17.440]  she said a tomato plant,
[18:17.440 --> 18:19.240]  all the tomatoes are kind of gonna get chopped up
[18:19.240 --> 18:20.080]  and put in a salad.
[18:20.080 --> 18:23.280]  So at one point, you harvest when you harvest.
[18:23.280 --> 18:24.960]  But I was curious on cannabis plants,
[18:24.960 --> 18:28.840]  how different could these trichomes be
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.240]  affecting possibly the CBD concentration
[18:32.240 --> 18:35.360]  within the same plant, but just at different locations?
[18:35.400 --> 18:38.400]  So that was kind of the basis of some of my work.
[18:39.640 --> 18:42.120]  So I'm just gonna take you all through
[18:42.120 --> 18:44.040]  kind of where I am in my work so far
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.120]  and then you all can ask any questions at the end.
[18:48.120 --> 18:50.240]  So the hypothesis of my work is essentially
[18:50.240 --> 18:52.400]  to check the quantity or density
[18:52.400 --> 18:55.520]  and I'll explain the difference between those of trichomes.
[18:55.520 --> 18:59.480]  And my guess is that trichomes will vary significantly
[18:59.480 --> 19:01.200]  across different parts of the plant,
[19:01.200 --> 19:04.160]  just because even if it's one node at the bottom
[19:04.160 --> 19:05.960]  that's maybe in the shade of another one
[19:05.960 --> 19:07.960]  or that was kind of my guess.
[19:07.960 --> 19:10.920]  And then CBDA concentrations
[19:10.920 --> 19:12.440]  being compared to those quantities
[19:12.440 --> 19:15.160]  and is there any type of correlation between that
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.880]  or are we just seeing differences that maybe
[19:17.880 --> 19:20.720]  are attributed to something else that we're not measuring?
[19:21.920 --> 19:24.360]  When I say local variation or sample location,
[19:24.360 --> 19:26.920]  you'll see a one, two and three.
[19:26.920 --> 19:29.160]  These just refer to the apical meristem
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.760]  or the tallest flowering node, 50% of that node's height.
[19:34.360 --> 19:36.520]  So 50% of the tallest flowering node
[19:36.520 --> 19:38.000]  and then the lowest flowering node
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  that I could collect two tenths of a sample from.
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.440]  So two tenths of a gram.
[19:45.600 --> 19:48.520]  So we had seven cultivars, there were eight, but they died.
[19:48.520 --> 19:51.400]  They were all grown in a federally compliant
[19:51.400 --> 19:53.800]  state licensed greenhouse facility.
[19:54.760 --> 19:58.160]  All samples were harvested at week nine of flowering.
[19:58.160 --> 20:00.160]  And again, what we did was analyze
[20:00.160 --> 20:03.760]  the tallest flowering node, the half of that height
[20:03.760 --> 20:05.560]  and then the lowest flowering node.
[20:05.560 --> 20:07.600]  And two samples were collected at each location
[20:07.600 --> 20:10.800]  just to kind of see if there were massive differences.
[20:11.760 --> 20:13.840]  The cultivars were intentionally anonymized.
[20:13.840 --> 20:15.720]  The reason that I did this is because
[20:17.080 --> 20:19.120]  for people who maybe don't understand the processing
[20:19.120 --> 20:21.440]  or the extraction, I don't want to
[20:22.680 --> 20:24.440]  either have my research manipulated
[20:24.440 --> 20:27.240]  or misrepresent maybe the trichome density
[20:27.240 --> 20:29.040]  of these different cultivars.
[20:29.040 --> 20:31.400]  Because again, grown in different environments
[20:31.400 --> 20:33.880]  it could show a totally different expression
[20:33.880 --> 20:36.680]  of metabolites, trichome density, things of that nature.
[20:39.360 --> 20:42.920]  So the research layout was onsite floral coastal analysis.
[20:42.920 --> 20:46.160]  So as soon as I showed up and actually measured
[20:46.160 --> 20:48.640]  and marked this top, middle and bottom of this plant
[20:48.640 --> 20:51.800]  I went ahead and ran cannabinoid analysis.
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.560]  I'll talk about that in a second.
[20:53.560 --> 20:57.080]  I also collected samples from each location
[20:57.080 --> 20:59.200]  took them back to the laboratory immediately
[20:59.200 --> 21:01.480]  and dissected the floral clusters
[21:01.480 --> 21:03.280]  looking for one individual calyx
[21:03.280 --> 21:05.920]  kind of at the most distal part
[21:05.920 --> 21:09.120]  of the branch of that node that I collected.
[21:10.080 --> 21:13.360]  Those individual calyces were fixed to a brass stud
[21:13.360 --> 21:15.000]  and imaged under SEM.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.840]  There were two different fixation methods that we use.
[21:17.840 --> 21:21.080]  So methanol ethanol fixation, as well as liquid nitrogen
[21:21.080 --> 21:22.360]  just to kind of compare.
[21:22.360 --> 21:24.840]  And I'll talk about why we did that.
[21:24.840 --> 21:26.680]  Those images were uploaded to ImageJ
[21:27.280 --> 21:28.960]  where I manually have been counting trichomes
[21:28.960 --> 21:31.720]  for the last, I'm not sure how many months
[21:31.720 --> 21:35.800]  but that data was then calculated against the calyx length
[21:35.800 --> 21:39.000]  width and area to create a density metric.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.880]  And then data tab was used in Excel
[21:42.880 --> 21:45.760]  to kind of do our statistical analysis.
[21:45.760 --> 21:47.960]  We are still working, but I do kind of want to run you all
[21:47.960 --> 21:50.000]  through where we are in the research.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.040]  So my three main aims, the first one again
[21:53.040 --> 21:56.040]  to compare methanol ethanol fixation to liquid nitrogen.
[21:56.040 --> 21:58.320]  The reason behind this is methanol ethanol
[21:58.320 --> 22:02.480]  is a more traditional plant fixative method.
[22:02.480 --> 22:05.240]  The issue with this is anybody who kind of knows
[22:05.240 --> 22:08.600]  how they make old medicine
[22:08.600 --> 22:10.840]  or how they make what's called tinctures.
[22:10.840 --> 22:12.560]  As soon as I heard methanol ethanol, I was like,
[22:12.560 --> 22:14.840]  oh, I think that that's gonna cause an extra,
[22:14.840 --> 22:17.240]  that's an extraction essentially.
[22:17.240 --> 22:20.680]  So I wanted to compare traditional fixative methods.
[22:20.680 --> 22:24.320]  And when I say fixative, I mean the scanning electron
[22:24.320 --> 22:27.520]  microscope that I use operates within a vacuum
[22:27.520 --> 22:31.680]  and this vacuum samples that contain water
[22:32.760 --> 22:36.360]  will kind of just be distorted when this vacuum occurs.
[22:36.360 --> 22:45.160]  So prior to actually imaging in the SEM,
[22:45.160 --> 22:47.440]  the samples either need to be dehydrated or fixed
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.080]  or something that'll keep them stable and safe
[22:51.080 --> 22:54.200]  so they can be imaged inside the machine.
[22:54.200 --> 22:56.000]  Aim two was to use cryo SEM
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.960]  to image individually dissected calyx.
[22:58.960 --> 23:02.360]  And then aim three was to analyze floral clusters.
[23:02.360 --> 23:06.600]  So again, the same size sample from each of these clusters
[23:06.600 --> 23:07.440]  that you see in the picture.
[23:07.440 --> 23:10.760]  And this is one of the best examples that I have.
[23:10.760 --> 23:13.760]  These are all from the same plant, same cultivar,
[23:13.760 --> 23:15.680]  but they were collected from different locations.
[23:15.680 --> 23:18.800]  And just at first sight, when you look at them visually,
[23:18.800 --> 23:22.080]  there's obviously, you can see differences
[23:22.080 --> 23:24.240]  in between those three different locations.
[23:26.800 --> 23:29.680]  And aim three was to analyze those floral cluster samples.
[23:29.680 --> 23:32.120]  So to actually take that, again,
[23:32.120 --> 23:34.120]  analyze that metabolite concentration
[23:34.120 --> 23:35.840]  and then compare it to the density
[23:35.840 --> 23:38.400]  to see if there was any type of correlation at all.
[23:40.280 --> 23:42.360]  Just so I don't lead you all, we're not finished.
[23:42.360 --> 23:44.400]  So I don't have the answers for you today,
[23:44.400 --> 23:46.680]  but I do want to update you all on kind of how this applies
[23:46.680 --> 23:48.800]  to harvest and where we're going.
[23:48.800 --> 23:51.480]  So aim one was methanol ethanol fixation.
[23:51.480 --> 23:53.440]  The image over to the left is what it looks like
[23:53.440 --> 23:55.320]  prior to actually being asserted
[23:55.320 --> 23:57.920]  into the scanning electron microscope.
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.080]  This was soaked in methanol for 10 minutes,
[24:00.080 --> 24:04.440]  switched back to ethanol and then back to methanol one time.
[24:04.440 --> 24:07.280]  And it was treated with a critical point dryer.
[24:07.280 --> 24:09.240]  So you can even see just looking at it,
[24:10.120 --> 24:13.400]  it doesn't really have any green color to it anymore,
[24:13.400 --> 24:16.760]  but it is, again, the most common and traditional way
[24:16.760 --> 24:21.040]  to image plant samples in a scanning electron microscope.
[24:21.960 --> 24:25.600]  The other method that we prepared was using liquid nitrogen.
[24:25.600 --> 24:28.240]  So you can see I have a liquid nitrogen tank here.
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.720]  This is a cold resistant bowl,
[24:29.720 --> 24:32.160]  which we pour the liquid nitrogen directly into.
[24:33.200 --> 24:36.680]  A leaf or plant sample is fixed to a brass tub.
[24:36.680 --> 24:39.160]  And then we actually dip it in that liquid nitrogen.
[24:39.160 --> 24:43.000]  It equilibrates bubbles as the sample is cooling.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.080]  And then once it actually stops bubbling,
[24:46.080 --> 24:48.280]  that was just kind of our insistent.
[24:48.280 --> 24:49.720]  We take it out of the liquid nitrogen
[24:49.720 --> 24:50.920]  once it stops bubbling.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.960]  There's kind of a really quick time limit after that
[24:53.960 --> 24:55.840]  where you have to drop this brass piece
[24:55.840 --> 24:57.560]  into the silver holding piece
[24:57.560 --> 24:59.840]  and insert it into the electron microscope.
[25:01.600 --> 25:04.840]  This leaf, I don't want anybody to think I'm being fake.
[25:04.840 --> 25:07.280]  This leaf is not a cannabis leaf.
[25:07.280 --> 25:08.840]  This leaf is actually from,
[25:08.840 --> 25:11.640]  I think it's traditionally called Cuban oregano,
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.520]  which is not the appropriate name for it,
[25:13.520 --> 25:15.640]  but it's more well-known name.
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.760]  And it is a plant that is rich in terpene.
[25:18.760 --> 25:19.880]  So I was very interested
[25:19.880 --> 25:22.640]  because I used to walk by it every day in the greenhouse
[25:22.640 --> 25:23.880]  and kind of rub my hand on it.
[25:23.880 --> 25:26.480]  And I would smell that this smells lemony.
[25:26.480 --> 25:29.320]  And I got very interested talking to my thesis advisor.
[25:29.320 --> 25:30.160]  I said, hey, you know,
[25:30.160 --> 25:33.080]  if there's terpenes being produced in this other plant,
[25:33.080 --> 25:35.320]  maybe instead of wasting hemp samples
[25:35.320 --> 25:37.160]  while I'm still trying to learn these methods,
[25:37.160 --> 25:39.680]  I can use another plant and really test out
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.080]  and see how well this method works
[25:42.080 --> 25:43.680]  to use liquid nitrogen and image.
[25:43.680 --> 25:47.160]  So this is actually the image of that.
[25:47.160 --> 25:49.720]  If you see this video over here to the left.
[25:54.370 --> 25:57.170]  So this is the surface of what I just showed you.
[25:57.170 --> 25:58.850]  And this is what it would look like
[25:58.850 --> 26:00.290]  under an electron microscope,
[26:00.290 --> 26:04.570]  essentially taking that and increasing that resolution
[26:04.570 --> 26:08.570]  and that magnification all the way down to the surface.
[26:10.290 --> 26:11.690]  Whenever I'm doing this work,
[26:11.690 --> 26:15.650]  I always wonder where Dr. Seuss got a lot of his ideas from.
[26:16.130 --> 26:17.210]  And I say that jokingly,
[26:17.210 --> 26:20.050]  but something that's really interesting is,
[26:20.050 --> 26:21.570]  sorry, I wanted to pause that.
[26:23.010 --> 26:24.250]  Something that's really interesting is
[26:24.250 --> 26:26.770]  if you look at the uniformity under here,
[26:26.770 --> 26:29.810]  it almost looks like it's built in a very specific way.
[26:29.810 --> 26:32.690]  So that's why I got curious about density
[26:32.690 --> 26:35.290]  and the actual count and why there are differences.
[26:35.290 --> 26:37.650]  Why are there bulbous trichomes right here?
[26:37.650 --> 26:40.610]  And why is there a stalked trichome right next to it?
[26:40.610 --> 26:42.610]  Again, this isn't in a cannabis sample,
[26:42.610 --> 26:46.010]  but I use this as a proxy essentially or a practice
[26:46.010 --> 26:47.970]  to get the methodology down.
[26:47.970 --> 26:51.370]  Because like I said, SEM is kind of an art form.
[26:51.370 --> 26:52.610]  I've met a lot of people who do it,
[26:52.610 --> 26:54.970]  but I realized everybody does it a little differently.
[26:54.970 --> 26:57.570]  And I found out that this methodology worked really well
[26:57.570 --> 27:00.210]  for some of the images that I was trying to take.
[27:03.090 --> 27:06.210]  So liquid nitrogen versus methanol, ethanol.
[27:06.210 --> 27:08.810]  So these two images, the image over to the left
[27:08.810 --> 27:12.130]  is gonna be the liquid nitrogen sample that was prepared
[27:12.130 --> 27:13.410]  from a cannabis plant.
[27:13.410 --> 27:15.770]  And the image to the right is gonna be
[27:15.770 --> 27:19.010]  methanol, ethanol prepared image.
[27:19.010 --> 27:21.330]  So the pros and cons are really what we were looking at
[27:21.330 --> 27:23.210]  in this aim to see, hey, should we use
[27:23.210 --> 27:24.570]  the traditional fixative method
[27:24.570 --> 27:26.530]  of methanol, ethanol preparation,
[27:26.530 --> 27:30.330]  or should we use liquid nitrogen and go more cryo SEM?
[27:31.250 --> 27:34.130]  So what we noticed was very obviously,
[27:34.130 --> 27:37.810]  if you look over to the right, comparing the pictures,
[27:37.810 --> 27:40.770]  some of the glandular trichomes or these heads that,
[27:40.770 --> 27:42.010]  in the image over to the left,
[27:42.890 --> 27:45.090]  not a perfect sphere, but again,
[27:45.090 --> 27:48.010]  the morphology is very distinctive
[27:48.010 --> 27:49.370]  from the image to the right where
[27:49.370 --> 27:50.690]  the only way I can really describe it
[27:50.690 --> 27:54.690]  is it looks kind of like balloons have been deflated.
[27:54.690 --> 27:57.570]  So the whole purpose of this is to try to preserve
[27:57.570 --> 27:59.050]  the natural profile.
[27:59.050 --> 28:02.370]  All the images that we took were from samples
[28:02.370 --> 28:04.610]  that were not dried, they were not cured,
[28:04.610 --> 28:07.290]  they were taken from live cannabis plants.
[28:07.290 --> 28:09.490]  And that's one of the first things that really stood out
[28:09.490 --> 28:11.170]  to me over here to the left.
[28:11.170 --> 28:15.010]  If the trichomes are what are producing these metabolites,
[28:15.010 --> 28:17.690]  and we're typically distorting these trichomes,
[28:17.690 --> 28:21.730]  whether it be drying, curing, things of that nature,
[28:21.730 --> 28:24.210]  the image over to the left that we use liquid nitrogen
[28:24.210 --> 28:28.050]  seemed to give us really high resolution pictures
[28:28.050 --> 28:30.890]  with not a lot of distortion or kind of warping.
[28:30.890 --> 28:33.890]  I will be transparent and say the biggest difference is
[28:33.890 --> 28:35.490]  when you use liquid nitrogen,
[28:35.490 --> 28:37.850]  your sample is destroyed in the process.
[28:37.850 --> 28:40.170]  There is no way to pull it out, analyze it later,
[28:40.170 --> 28:42.090]  do anything else with it.
[28:42.090 --> 28:43.770]  When you use methanol ethanol,
[28:43.770 --> 28:48.210]  that sample is actually able to be stored
[28:48.210 --> 28:51.530]  in a controlled environment and then used again later.
[28:51.530 --> 28:55.370]  So for our research, we use liquid nitrogen.
[28:55.370 --> 28:57.810]  The reason that I brought up what I just said is
[28:57.810 --> 29:00.450]  the industry standard for floral cannabis,
[29:00.450 --> 29:02.170]  again, we're talking about harvesting,
[29:02.170 --> 29:07.170]  is to air dry prior to processing and packaging.
[29:07.170 --> 29:09.010]  I got really curious in the process of using
[29:09.010 --> 29:12.090]  liquid nitrogen and methanol ethanol and was thinking,
[29:12.090 --> 29:14.930]  hey, if the most common way is neither one of these,
[29:14.930 --> 29:19.370]  prior to processing or anyone consuming it
[29:19.370 --> 29:23.250]  or whatever it's being used for, we're typically drying.
[29:23.250 --> 29:25.690]  We understand that there's decarboxylation going on,
[29:25.690 --> 29:27.970]  but I don't hear much conversation about
[29:27.970 --> 29:30.770]  what's going on with the morphology of the trichome.
[29:30.770 --> 29:33.650]  So this is kind of an extreme case.
[29:33.650 --> 29:37.810]  We just left this out in a room at room temperature.
[29:37.810 --> 29:41.730]  I didn't put it in like a climate control kind of box
[29:41.730 --> 29:45.050]  or anything or in a room where we control the climate.
[29:45.050 --> 29:47.050]  I was curious just to see at two weeks,
[29:47.050 --> 29:50.130]  just on a counter kind of what the differences would be.
[29:50.130 --> 29:52.930]  And these SEM images show again,
[29:52.930 --> 29:54.850]  not the same as that methanol ethanol
[29:54.850 --> 29:57.050]  or that solvent based fixation,
[29:57.050 --> 30:00.330]  but you can see this kind of distortion
[30:00.330 --> 30:02.210]  of the glandular heads again.
[30:02.210 --> 30:03.690]  They look like deflated balloons.
[30:03.690 --> 30:06.970]  And even if you look at the floor or the base
[30:07.010 --> 30:08.530]  where these trichomes are,
[30:08.530 --> 30:10.050]  you can kind of see almost this,
[30:10.050 --> 30:12.330]  it almost looks wrinkled or kind of shriveled.
[30:14.450 --> 30:16.170]  Aim two was image quantification.
[30:16.170 --> 30:19.850]  So once these images were taken from each of these locations,
[30:19.850 --> 30:24.010]  the area was actually calculated for each image.
[30:24.010 --> 30:26.050]  If you look at this image on the bottom,
[30:26.050 --> 30:29.930]  we actually use the scale bar in image J to set the ratio
[30:29.930 --> 30:32.570]  so that the scale bar in the bottom right-hand corner
[30:32.570 --> 30:33.770]  of the image, this set,
[30:35.850 --> 30:36.690]  where is it?
[30:37.610 --> 30:39.810]  On the bottom right at 500 micrometers
[30:39.810 --> 30:43.170]  that we were actually able to relate that to a pixel ratio.
[30:43.170 --> 30:45.690]  So that way we were able to analyze
[30:45.690 --> 30:47.370]  the not only the glandular count,
[30:47.370 --> 30:49.690]  but the calyx length with,
[30:49.690 --> 30:52.170]  and the density, which we used area
[30:53.570 --> 30:56.490]  like the image in the upper left-hand corner to calculate.
[30:58.090 --> 30:58.930]  Excuse me.
[31:00.250 --> 31:03.170]  Also for sample analysis for the glandular trichome count,
[31:04.170 --> 31:05.410]  I left some of these undone.
[31:05.410 --> 31:06.410]  I know somebody is going to say,
[31:06.850 --> 31:08.530]  it doesn't look like they've all been counted.
[31:08.530 --> 31:10.530]  Once you count all of these
[31:10.530 --> 31:12.650]  and you circle each one manually,
[31:12.650 --> 31:15.650]  it becomes a very dense picture to look at
[31:15.650 --> 31:17.530]  and you can't really see what's underneath.
[31:17.530 --> 31:20.050]  So you can see there's still some bulbous glandular trichomes
[31:20.050 --> 31:22.970]  that are visible kind of in the middle of that picture.
[31:22.970 --> 31:26.290]  But each of those red dots represents a glandular trichome
[31:26.290 --> 31:28.410]  that I've manually went ahead and counted
[31:29.450 --> 31:31.050]  using image J software.
[31:34.480 --> 31:36.200]  And then aim three,
[31:36.200 --> 31:38.920]  I kind of compare a lot of these differences.
[31:38.920 --> 31:41.640]  And there's a ton of different variables that I share
[31:41.640 --> 31:42.960]  really, really close to being finished,
[31:42.960 --> 31:44.520]  but I don't want to share prematurely.
[31:44.520 --> 31:48.000]  But looking at this picture in the upper left-hand corner,
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.720]  again, this is the same thing.
[31:50.720 --> 31:55.200]  If you look from, I believe, let's see, left to right,
[31:55.200 --> 31:58.480]  each of these rows represent a different cultivar
[31:58.480 --> 32:01.320]  and samples collected from, again, the apical meristem,
[32:01.320 --> 32:03.760]  50% of that apical meristem height,
[32:03.760 --> 32:05.520]  and then the lowest flowering node.
[32:06.280 --> 32:08.640]  Two-tenths of a gram of each kind of floral cluster
[32:08.640 --> 32:10.240]  or inflorescence was homogenized
[32:10.240 --> 32:13.160]  and combined with 30 milliliters of methanol,
[32:13.160 --> 32:14.800]  agitated for five to eight minutes,
[32:14.800 --> 32:18.080]  and then four milliliters of the sample was injected
[32:18.080 --> 32:21.520]  into the Light Lab 3 portable chromatography device.
[32:21.520 --> 32:25.640]  And that is how we calculated the CBDA concentration live
[32:26.720 --> 32:29.680]  as soon as we removed these floral clusters.
[32:31.320 --> 32:32.960]  One thing I want to give a disclaimer for,
[32:32.960 --> 32:35.520]  I don't want anyone to be upset at me.
[32:35.560 --> 32:36.640]  I don't want anybody to think
[32:36.640 --> 32:40.040]  that I am boosting my CBDA numbers.
[32:40.040 --> 32:41.440]  I actually did this on purpose
[32:41.440 --> 32:43.240]  because this is one of the biggest questions
[32:43.240 --> 32:45.880]  in the industry is, when we see tests,
[32:45.880 --> 32:47.760]  when we see the cannabinoid concentrations,
[32:47.760 --> 32:49.400]  the terpene concentration,
[32:49.400 --> 32:51.920]  what is being represented there?
[32:51.920 --> 32:56.160]  So I got really interested in looking at calyx.
[32:56.160 --> 32:57.680]  That was the primary basis.
[32:57.680 --> 33:00.360]  I didn't want leaves and I didn't want stems.
[33:00.360 --> 33:02.480]  Because I was imaging isolated calyx
[33:02.480 --> 33:04.240]  with all those other parts removed,
[33:04.240 --> 33:07.560]  I decided to isolate and only test
[33:07.560 --> 33:09.360]  the cannabinoid concentration of calyx
[33:09.360 --> 33:11.720]  since these are where the highest density
[33:11.720 --> 33:15.680]  of glandular trichomes are resting.
[33:15.680 --> 33:17.680]  So this image right here, again,
[33:17.680 --> 33:20.240]  shows two tenths of a gram of the same sample
[33:20.240 --> 33:23.360]  from the same plant on the same branch.
[33:23.360 --> 33:25.400]  And you can kind of make the assumption, right,
[33:25.400 --> 33:26.400]  from what most of us know
[33:26.400 --> 33:29.360]  that these two samples tested differently.
[33:29.360 --> 33:32.320]  And it's because, again, if some of these leaves
[33:32.320 --> 33:35.640]  and some of these stems have a lower trichome density,
[33:35.640 --> 33:37.760]  you would expect that the concentration
[33:37.760 --> 33:42.800]  of metabolites would be lower.
[33:42.800 --> 33:45.080]  So this is just a kind of profile,
[33:45.080 --> 33:49.000]  cannabinoid profile of once you run your actual test
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.280]  using the Light Lab.
[33:50.280 --> 33:53.200]  So these were actually put into my Excel sheet
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.360]  and compared to trichome density based on each location.
[33:58.360 --> 34:01.720]  This is just a quick picture to kind of give you
[34:01.720 --> 34:03.560]  an idea of what it's like.
[34:03.560 --> 34:05.160]  So this picture all the way to the left
[34:05.160 --> 34:07.520]  is going to be the calyx isolated
[34:07.520 --> 34:09.400]  from the top of the plant.
[34:09.400 --> 34:10.960]  This is the middle of the plant in the middle,
[34:10.960 --> 34:13.200]  and then the bottom of the plant all the way to the right.
[34:13.200 --> 34:16.280]  So again, they were measured for width,
[34:16.280 --> 34:19.040]  length, area, trichome density,
[34:19.040 --> 34:21.240]  and then the floral cluster that they were sampled from
[34:21.240 --> 34:26.320]  was analyzed for CBDA concentration.
[34:26.320 --> 34:29.200]  These are all the total metrics of analysis.
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.280]  Once I finish this research and go ahead and defend my thesis
[34:33.280 --> 34:35.240]  and make it public,
[34:35.240 --> 34:38.240]  but I did want people to know that all the cultivars
[34:38.240 --> 34:40.000]  from the same location,
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.800]  the trichome density of each cultivar,
[34:41.800 --> 34:45.480]  so again, trichome density of say plant A
[34:45.480 --> 34:47.080]  at location one, two, and three,
[34:47.080 --> 34:48.880]  which would mean the same plant at the top
[34:48.880 --> 34:50.480]  and the middle of the bottom.
[34:50.480 --> 34:53.760]  Those were compared as well as the CBDA concentrations
[34:53.760 --> 34:56.760]  and some of the other variables that we're looking at
[34:56.760 --> 34:58.760]  is calyx width versus length.
[34:58.760 --> 34:59.800]  Does that have anything to do?
[34:59.800 --> 35:01.480]  Is there a difference between the top of the plant
[35:01.480 --> 35:02.760]  and the bottom of the plant
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.760]  in other locations as well as area,
[35:05.760 --> 35:07.800]  glandular trichome count,
[35:07.800 --> 35:11.400]  and just kind of comparing all these different variables.
[35:11.400 --> 35:13.040]  Just really quickly, again,
[35:13.040 --> 35:14.160]  I don't want to spoil everything.
[35:14.160 --> 35:16.680]  I do still have to present this research
[35:16.680 --> 35:17.640]  to my thesis committee,
[35:17.640 --> 35:20.800]  but the average glandular trichome count was something,
[35:20.800 --> 35:23.160]  again, one of the first things that we actually got
[35:23.160 --> 35:24.000]  and we counted.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.320]  So the bar on the left of each sample
[35:27.320 --> 35:30.280]  will be the apical meristem location one,
[35:30.280 --> 35:31.480]  two follows as the middle,
[35:31.480 --> 35:33.240]  and then three being the lower.
[35:33.240 --> 35:35.880]  These were the count of glandular trichomes.
[35:35.880 --> 35:38.000]  I did not separate glandular stalks
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.400]  from sessile glandular from bulbous,
[35:40.400 --> 35:43.680]  A, because as the density increases,
[35:43.680 --> 35:44.680]  it becomes very difficult
[35:44.680 --> 35:47.720]  to even see the bulbous glandular trichomes,
[35:47.720 --> 35:49.680]  and B, I wanted to make sure
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.960]  that we were actually including all trichomes
[35:53.960 --> 35:56.680]  that contributed to some type of metabolite concentration,
[35:56.680 --> 35:59.760]  regardless of what little way, shape,
[35:59.800 --> 36:00.800]  or form it may be.
[36:01.680 --> 36:03.800]  So these are just our counts.
[36:03.800 --> 36:05.920]  In my mind, we like to think
[36:05.920 --> 36:07.960]  that the plant is produced evenly,
[36:07.960 --> 36:09.240]  that it ripens evenly,
[36:09.240 --> 36:11.040]  that these trichomes are going to be
[36:11.040 --> 36:13.080]  the highest at the top,
[36:13.080 --> 36:14.480]  moderate amount in the middle,
[36:14.480 --> 36:16.080]  and the lowest at the bottom,
[36:16.080 --> 36:17.080]  but that's not the case.
[36:17.080 --> 36:19.360]  In fact, it was highly variable.
[36:19.360 --> 36:21.400]  One of the things I have to remember in research
[36:21.400 --> 36:23.520]  is that it's always great if you find something,
[36:23.520 --> 36:24.680]  but more often than not,
[36:24.680 --> 36:26.560]  you won't find anything.
[36:26.560 --> 36:29.040]  And you use that research to write,
[36:29.040 --> 36:31.120]  to kind of build more research from that.
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.360]  So average CBDA concentrations,
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.080]  again, these are typically higher
[36:37.080 --> 36:38.240]  than what you would normally see.
[36:38.240 --> 36:40.520]  That is because all the stems,
[36:40.520 --> 36:43.600]  all the non-glandular, excuse me,
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.600]  all the floral parts that don't contain
[36:48.600 --> 36:52.320]  a high density of glandular cannabinoids were removed,
[36:52.320 --> 36:54.440]  and these are just the calyx.
[36:54.440 --> 36:55.560]  So from each location,
[36:55.560 --> 36:57.920]  you'll see, if you look at plant sample A,
[36:57.920 --> 36:59.560]  it's kind of what people would typically expect,
[36:59.560 --> 37:01.160]  highest at the top,
[37:01.160 --> 37:02.320]  moderate in the middle,
[37:02.320 --> 37:04.000]  big drop at the bottom.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.360]  But there are some differences
[37:05.360 --> 37:06.720]  between different cultivars,
[37:06.720 --> 37:10.760]  and sample F was pretty interesting
[37:10.760 --> 37:12.320]  because the CBDA concentration
[37:12.320 --> 37:14.040]  didn't vary much at all
[37:14.040 --> 37:16.000]  from the top and middle and the bottom.
[37:18.160 --> 37:21.360]  This is just a box plot of the length in millimeters
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.360]  versus the, oh, this is, sorry,
[37:24.360 --> 37:26.400]  this is the difference in length average
[37:26.400 --> 37:29.560]  across each sample in millimeters.
[37:29.560 --> 37:30.600]  The reason we were looking at this
[37:30.600 --> 37:33.800]  is because I was curious if each cultivar,
[37:33.800 --> 37:36.560]  if there was like a normal size of calyx,
[37:36.560 --> 37:38.560]  you'll see research will kind of say
[37:38.560 --> 37:40.560]  there's a certain size of calyx,
[37:40.560 --> 37:41.880]  but what we realized from each sample
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.840]  was that they could be totally different.
[37:43.840 --> 37:46.120]  G was kind of our outlier,
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.960]  but again, there's still more data to contribute to this.
[37:50.200 --> 37:52.280]  So preliminary conclusions kind of from this aim
[37:52.280 --> 37:53.960]  and to make it applicable for harvest,
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.360]  why did we do all this talk about glandular trichomes?
[37:58.480 --> 38:00.280]  First, the results revealed that trichomes
[38:00.280 --> 38:01.720]  are very sensitive and delicate
[38:01.720 --> 38:04.760]  and exposing them to methanol ethanol can dissolve them,
[38:04.760 --> 38:07.240]  which makes kind of the imaging after that
[38:07.240 --> 38:09.440]  not representative of a natural
[38:09.440 --> 38:11.440]  living cannabis plant's trichomes.
[38:12.760 --> 38:14.600]  The SEM images that were obtained
[38:14.600 --> 38:17.640]  from the top and middle and the bottom of the plant,
[38:17.640 --> 38:19.400]  there's obvious differences that were shown,
[38:19.400 --> 38:21.160]  but we do need more research to go ahead
[38:21.160 --> 38:24.200]  and be able to say there's any type of correlations
[38:24.200 --> 38:25.800]  between different locations.
[38:25.800 --> 38:27.800]  From what we've seen so far,
[38:27.800 --> 38:30.600]  it's been vastly different at each spot,
[38:30.600 --> 38:33.120]  which again has been part of the research process,
[38:33.120 --> 38:38.120]  but the summary of these results
[38:38.360 --> 38:40.840]  and to make it applicable to a farmer
[38:40.840 --> 38:42.480]  or anyone who's cultivating,
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.000]  there's so many factors that go into trichomes,
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.520]  I have to take a step back afterwards
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.920]  and consider what else might be at play.
[38:48.920 --> 38:51.200]  If we're looking at the same plant,
[38:51.200 --> 38:53.400]  which is the same genetics, this isn't a clone,
[38:53.400 --> 38:55.040]  this is the exact same plant.
[38:55.040 --> 38:57.080]  So where is this variability coming into play
[38:57.080 --> 38:59.160]  if we're using the same testing device,
[38:59.160 --> 39:02.280]  the same methods, the same solvents,
[39:02.280 --> 39:04.400]  where could this variability kind of come into play?
[39:04.400 --> 39:05.680]  And these are kind of some of the things
[39:05.680 --> 39:07.960]  for farmers to think about.
[39:07.960 --> 39:09.240]  The genetic potential, right?
[39:09.240 --> 39:10.800]  What kind of mother plant is it?
[39:10.800 --> 39:13.080]  Where are you getting your genetics from?
[39:13.080 --> 39:16.240]  Are you gonna be pollinating that plant to get seed
[39:16.240 --> 39:18.520]  or are you taking clones from that plant?
[39:19.120 --> 39:21.000]  The seed stage, we have to think about environments
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.640]  and nutrients along with the genetics
[39:22.640 --> 39:23.520]  from that mother plant.
[39:23.520 --> 39:26.760]  So is there some type of epigenetic effect on trichomes
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.400]  where possibly the environment is affecting
[39:30.400 --> 39:33.120]  this expression of different metabolites,
[39:33.120 --> 39:35.440]  even in very subtle ways on the same plant?
[39:36.600 --> 39:38.440]  And then to consider that,
[39:38.440 --> 39:41.040]  we're really looking at this glandular trichome production
[39:41.040 --> 39:42.680]  in floral cannabis,
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.520]  in these sexually mature female cannabis plants,
[39:46.520 --> 39:50.920]  only once they are un-pollinated and they continue to swell
[39:50.920 --> 39:54.320]  and increase their cannabinoid concentrations.
[39:54.320 --> 39:56.680]  The opinionative method that's been used traditionally
[39:56.680 --> 40:01.680]  is that clear, cloudy and amber are the subjective means
[40:01.680 --> 40:03.120]  which we use with the naked eye
[40:03.120 --> 40:06.760]  or a low magnification imaging device
[40:06.760 --> 40:09.080]  to analyze these trichomes.
[40:09.080 --> 40:12.280]  But those don't give concrete insight
[40:12.280 --> 40:14.480]  into something that can protect the farmer
[40:14.480 --> 40:18.040]  from cultivating a federally non-compliant
[40:18.040 --> 40:20.080]  floral cannabis plant.
[40:20.080 --> 40:21.560]  Also to take into consideration
[40:21.560 --> 40:24.640]  that trichomes are not only sensitive afterwards,
[40:24.640 --> 40:26.200]  but they're sensitive on the plant as well.
[40:26.200 --> 40:28.360]  So pre-harvest and post-harvest,
[40:28.360 --> 40:29.880]  the environment that it's exposed to,
[40:29.880 --> 40:31.480]  whether it's a dry room,
[40:31.480 --> 40:33.600]  whether it's in an airtight device,
[40:33.600 --> 40:35.320]  whether it's exposed to humidity,
[40:35.320 --> 40:38.440]  all these things can affect the cannabinoid concentration
[40:38.440 --> 40:40.000]  and essentially make it look like
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.920]  you have a different metabolite profile
[40:42.920 --> 40:44.840]  prior to you harvesting and analyzing
[40:44.840 --> 40:46.360]  just with your naked eye.
[40:46.360 --> 40:48.920]  And then you analyzing that sample two or three weeks
[40:48.920 --> 40:51.400]  after it has sit in a certain environment.
[40:52.400 --> 40:55.320]  And again, we saw that trichome degradation
[40:55.320 --> 40:57.040]  with the air-dry samples.
[40:57.040 --> 40:58.680]  And then compound analysis,
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.520]  when we're saying a CBDA concentration,
[41:01.520 --> 41:04.200]  what material is represented in the samples being tested?
[41:04.200 --> 41:06.280]  Kind of those two images that I showed,
[41:06.280 --> 41:08.720]  are we looking strictly at the most dense parts?
[41:08.720 --> 41:12.000]  Are we looking at the kind of whole inflorescence
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.400]  and that kind of, you know,
[41:13.400 --> 41:16.160]  that's a long rabbit hole to talk about
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.440]  in compliance and testing and things of that nature.
[41:19.440 --> 41:21.240]  And then as the post-harvest environment
[41:21.240 --> 41:22.960]  affecting these trichomes
[41:22.960 --> 41:24.680]  and the secondary metabolite quality,
[41:24.680 --> 41:26.960]  we know about decarboxylation,
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.040]  but we don't often talk about the actual quality
[41:30.040 --> 41:32.760]  of the trichomes post-harvest.
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.840]  I'd like to thank my advisor, Dr. Gana.
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.720]  I'd like to thank my committee, Dr. Maselli and Dr. Earhart.
[41:40.720 --> 41:41.800]  Thank you to the core facilities
[41:41.800 --> 41:43.000]  at Chicago State University
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.680]  for keeping that electron microscope working
[41:46.600 --> 41:47.880]  during all these hot summers
[41:47.880 --> 41:50.160]  and power outages and different difficulties.
[41:50.160 --> 41:51.800]  And then thank you to Orange Photonics
[41:51.800 --> 41:54.560]  for allowing me to use the Light Lab 3
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.680]  portable cannabis analyzer for field sampling.
[41:58.600 --> 41:59.840]  And thank you to Cornell University
[41:59.840 --> 42:02.800]  for having me as a feature speaker for this webinar series.
[42:04.640 --> 42:05.800]  Well, you're very welcome.
[42:05.800 --> 42:07.040]  That was a great presentation.
[42:07.040 --> 42:08.720]  Steve, thank you so much.
[42:09.760 --> 42:10.600]  Thank you, thank you.
[42:11.320 --> 42:12.160]  Let me see.
[42:12.160 --> 42:15.200]  So let's, there's three Q&A.
[42:17.120 --> 42:18.800]  Have you tried using an environmental
[42:18.800 --> 42:20.760]  scanning electron microscope?
[42:20.760 --> 42:22.560]  They allow viewing of living materials.
[42:22.560 --> 42:25.520]  UIUC has one in their microscopy facility
[42:25.520 --> 42:26.840]  if you want to try.
[42:26.840 --> 42:27.840]  I have not.
[42:27.840 --> 42:29.720]  I would love to try.
[42:29.720 --> 42:32.800]  I've learned a lot about kind of the differences
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.240]  in electron microscopes.
[42:34.240 --> 42:35.800]  And that was one of the things
[42:35.800 --> 42:38.240]  that we didn't have access to.
[42:38.240 --> 42:40.600]  But yes, that is kind of the path
[42:40.600 --> 42:43.480]  that we're trying to start this conversation.
[42:43.480 --> 42:46.520]  Instead of us always looking at the metabolite concentrations
[42:46.520 --> 42:48.760]  of a cannabis plant that's been harvested
[42:48.760 --> 42:50.560]  and is no longer alive,
[42:50.560 --> 42:52.480]  why don't we start looking more into the inside
[42:52.480 --> 42:55.400]  of these organisms while they're still living?
[42:55.400 --> 42:57.320]  So, great question.
[42:58.400 --> 43:02.760]  Did you see any structural variation in trichome samples
[43:02.760 --> 43:04.760]  collected from different locations
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.280]  and environment between the genotypes?
[43:09.280 --> 43:12.160]  So we didn't do any genotyping.
[43:12.160 --> 43:14.040]  Each cultivar that we looked at,
[43:14.040 --> 43:16.000]  if that's what you're asking,
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.680]  yes, we did see differences in each cultivar,
[43:18.680 --> 43:21.280]  but it was so vastly different that,
[43:24.480 --> 43:26.200]  you know, again, I think something
[43:26.200 --> 43:27.280]  that would have been amazing, right?
[43:27.280 --> 43:28.560]  This amazing breakthrough would have been
[43:28.560 --> 43:31.000]  if we found out, yeah, there's an even difference
[43:31.000 --> 43:32.720]  between the top, the middle and the bottom.
[43:32.880 --> 43:36.040]  There's this kind of gradual gradient of trichomes,
[43:36.040 --> 43:39.600]  but no, there was definitely structural differences
[43:39.600 --> 43:41.800]  in the morphology and the density
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.680]  at the same, within the same plant at different locations.
[43:46.760 --> 43:49.080]  But yeah, if that's what you mean by genotypes.
[43:50.720 --> 43:53.640]  Given the limited time and budget,
[43:53.640 --> 43:55.920]  what would you want to research?
[43:55.920 --> 43:58.680]  Yeah, so I would like to do a genetic component to that,
[43:58.680 --> 44:01.320]  whether it's epigenetics, genetics, genomics,
[44:01.320 --> 44:04.440]  just because we now have insight to kind of this,
[44:05.920 --> 44:10.320]  the genes that go into THCA synthase and CBDA synthase.
[44:10.320 --> 44:12.440]  And I think even knowing that
[44:12.440 --> 44:15.200]  and knowing that we can test these genetics,
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.080]  we're still finding out that there's this variability,
[44:18.080 --> 44:20.920]  right, this plasticity, if you want to call it.
[44:20.920 --> 44:24.400]  We know that because clones grown in different environments
[44:24.400 --> 44:25.600]  are obviously vastly different.
[44:25.600 --> 44:28.160]  So that's kind of something if I had an unlimited budget
[44:28.200 --> 44:32.200]  and cloudy versus clear harvest, half clear,
[44:32.200 --> 44:34.240]  I'm guessing you're asking me my opinion.
[44:37.880 --> 44:40.280]  I guess that's the whole point of my research in this talk
[44:40.280 --> 44:42.560]  is that it's so subjective, right?
[44:42.560 --> 44:44.880]  I've even, when I've been working with cultivators
[44:44.880 --> 44:48.880]  and farmers, I've asked them, you know, 70-30, 60-40,
[44:48.880 --> 44:50.960]  and they'll say it's different for every cultivar
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.040]  because they are using their nose
[44:53.040 --> 44:56.080]  and they are using their eyes and they're kind of,
[44:56.080 --> 44:58.040]  some of them have a really good technique down
[44:58.040 --> 44:59.960]  and some of them, you know, they realize that,
[44:59.960 --> 45:02.560]  hey, sometimes we do have to destroy our crops
[45:02.560 --> 45:03.640]  because they're non-compliant
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.960]  because maybe one plant that looks, you know, 60-40 is okay,
[45:07.960 --> 45:11.120]  but maybe another plant that's 60-40 becomes non-compliant.
[45:11.120 --> 45:14.240]  So, hello, I have a few questions.
[45:14.240 --> 45:16.880]  Peter, oh, Peter, that's a couple of questions.
[45:16.880 --> 45:18.080]  All right.
[45:18.080 --> 45:19.920]  What other issues do you believe,
[45:19.920 --> 45:21.480]  how much time do we have, Luis?
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.800]  It's supposed to end at 3 p.m.,
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.400]  but if there are many questions, I'm going to cover them all.
[45:28.400 --> 45:30.440]  We can extend that for a little bit.
[45:30.440 --> 45:33.480]  Oh, we got 12 minutes, right? Okay.
[45:33.480 --> 45:34.560]  I have a few questions to ask you.
[45:34.560 --> 45:36.720]  What other issues do you believe persist
[45:36.720 --> 45:39.720]  in the cannabis industry with regards to its growing,
[45:39.720 --> 45:41.200]  preparation, or consistency
[45:41.200 --> 45:44.520]  as both business owner and researcher?
[45:44.520 --> 45:46.720]  What other topics are still fresh for research
[45:46.720 --> 45:48.920]  in regards to cannabis and hemp?
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.800]  What has your experience been as a plant science researcher
[45:51.800 --> 45:52.880]  focusing on cannabis?
[45:52.880 --> 45:54.720]  Any difficulties in approval,
[45:54.720 --> 45:58.080]  finding information, sources, grants, anything unexpected?
[45:58.080 --> 46:01.360]  Yes, that's why I started with the DEA Schedule I status.
[46:01.360 --> 46:04.520]  That is obviously prohibitive to a lot of research
[46:04.520 --> 46:06.120]  that we're trying to do.
[46:06.120 --> 46:07.560]  Are there any fresh topics?
[46:07.560 --> 46:09.640]  Everything.
[46:09.640 --> 46:12.200]  I think that's why we're here, and it's not a novel field,
[46:12.200 --> 46:14.440]  but we're diving back into something humanity
[46:14.440 --> 46:17.600]  kind of took away from themselves during Prohibition.
[46:17.600 --> 46:19.280]  What other issues do you believe persist
[46:19.280 --> 46:21.120]  in the cannabis industry?
[46:21.120 --> 46:26.920]  I think that as each state begins to legalize,
[46:26.920 --> 46:29.520]  I think if you go immediately to indoor cultivation
[46:29.520 --> 46:31.640]  and mass production,
[46:31.640 --> 46:35.280]  you take away this kind of environmental parameters
[46:35.280 --> 46:39.160]  that have been used to get us to the kind of genetics
[46:39.160 --> 46:41.880]  that we have now, these local microclimates,
[46:41.880 --> 46:44.720]  Appalachians, terroir, if you will,
[46:44.720 --> 46:47.040]  that have the effect on how these plants are cultivated.
[46:47.640 --> 46:50.160]  I think one thing is to consider these environments
[46:50.160 --> 46:53.080]  and how much they do affect cannabis plants.
[46:53.080 --> 46:56.880]  Like I tell people, Florida and California both grow oranges,
[46:56.880 --> 47:00.160]  but they grow them for particularly different reasons.
[47:00.160 --> 47:01.840]  I think we'll get more into our regionality,
[47:01.840 --> 47:04.920]  more microclimates, maybe an heirloom,
[47:04.920 --> 47:09.640]  hopefully, kind of overhanging that covers
[47:09.640 --> 47:12.480]  those kind of, quote, unquote, legacy farmers, if you will.
[47:12.480 --> 47:14.000]  Can you discuss the optimal environments
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.240]  in which to store cannabis post-harvest
[47:16.240 --> 47:19.920]  to produce degradation of desirable compounds?
[47:19.920 --> 47:22.760]  Yeah, so again, this is, and I hate giving people
[47:22.760 --> 47:26.200]  the it depends answer, but it really does depend.
[47:26.200 --> 47:30.720]  Even just in the structure of the actual bud itself,
[47:30.720 --> 47:33.760]  that could change the actual airflow that you need.
[47:33.760 --> 47:36.040]  Say you have really, really dense floral clusters
[47:36.040 --> 47:37.680]  where they're kind of overlapping on each other
[47:37.680 --> 47:39.800]  as they're drying and curing.
[47:39.800 --> 47:41.760]  That may require more airflow than something
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.840]  that is kind of more, I hate using that, right,
[47:44.840 --> 47:47.120]  the traditional, what we consider sativa morphology
[47:47.120 --> 47:49.160]  or more leggy or more spread out.
[47:51.360 --> 47:52.400]  Peter asked another question.
[47:52.400 --> 47:54.240]  What do you recommend based on your experience
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.840]  to those getting interested in cannabis research?
[47:57.920 --> 48:00.640]  Find a topic you're passionate in and be patient
[48:00.640 --> 48:02.080]  and learn your local policy,
[48:02.080 --> 48:04.040]  because what I can do in Illinois
[48:04.040 --> 48:05.960]  is not the same as what Louise can do in New York,
[48:05.960 --> 48:08.920]  is not the same as what people can do in different states.
[48:08.920 --> 48:10.480]  So I think that's really, really important.
[48:10.480 --> 48:11.720]  Find something you're interested in
[48:11.720 --> 48:14.600]  and then learn your local legislation.
[48:15.360 --> 48:17.200]  Is there any possibility of trichomes changing
[48:17.200 --> 48:20.920]  from one form to the other with time?
[48:20.920 --> 48:24.240]  Yeah, so this is kind of one of the like,
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.760]  kind of groundbreaking researches that's out there.
[48:26.760 --> 48:28.080]  It's not mine.
[48:28.080 --> 48:29.160]  I don't want to take credit.
[48:29.160 --> 48:32.120]  It's Sam Livingston in Canada.
[48:32.120 --> 48:34.680]  He actually had a project where he compared
[48:34.680 --> 48:38.160]  sessile glandular trichomes to staunch glandular trichomes
[48:38.160 --> 48:41.200]  and in checking the actual transcriptome,
[48:41.200 --> 48:43.040]  because they have different metabolites
[48:43.040 --> 48:43.880]  that they're producing.
[48:44.200 --> 48:46.800]  Sesquiterpene, one is more monoterpene.
[48:46.800 --> 48:49.160]  Well, the transcriptome isn't different.
[48:49.160 --> 48:51.200]  They don't seem like they're any different,
[48:51.200 --> 48:54.240]  but they are producing different metabolites.
[48:54.240 --> 48:56.440]  So the thought process is that possibly
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.080]  sessile glandular trichomes would be precursors
[49:00.080 --> 49:01.360]  to staunch glandular trichomes,
[49:01.360 --> 49:02.880]  which makes a lot of sense.
[49:02.880 --> 49:05.000]  They're the same size and literally,
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.760]  what we realized is morphologically,
[49:06.760 --> 49:09.720]  nobody technically has a classification between the two.
[49:09.720 --> 49:11.480]  When does sessile become staunch?
[49:11.480 --> 49:13.280]  Like how far above the surface
[49:13.320 --> 49:14.720]  does it have to be flat on the surface?
[49:14.720 --> 49:16.320]  Can it be raised a little bit?
[49:16.320 --> 49:18.160]  Because there's some sessile glandular trichomes
[49:18.160 --> 49:20.600]  that sometimes are just above the surface.
[49:20.600 --> 49:22.400]  Is that going to keep developing into something
[49:22.400 --> 49:25.280]  that's raised above the surface or not?
[49:25.280 --> 49:26.960]  So definitely a possibility.
[49:26.960 --> 49:28.640]  And that's kind of where the research is right now.
[49:28.640 --> 49:29.760]  That's why we need to learn more
[49:29.760 --> 49:31.720]  because we honestly don't know.
[49:31.720 --> 49:34.440]  Have you looked at or know any correlations
[49:34.440 --> 49:36.640]  between trichome production and viruses
[49:36.640 --> 49:38.800]  we've seen in cannabis plants?
[49:38.800 --> 49:40.720]  So that is where I'm hoping that we get.
[49:40.720 --> 49:43.120]  I'm hoping that when we look at some of these plants
[49:43.960 --> 49:46.560]  that are more, I'll use powdery mildew
[49:46.560 --> 49:49.040]  for kind of an easy example.
[49:49.040 --> 49:52.640]  Is there a cannabis plant that is better
[49:52.640 --> 49:55.320]  at being more resistant to powdery mildew?
[49:55.320 --> 49:58.120]  Okay, is there some type of genetic component in there?
[49:58.120 --> 49:58.960]  Got you.
[49:58.960 --> 50:01.160]  Now from there, does that have anything to do
[50:01.160 --> 50:02.800]  with the trichome differences?
[50:02.800 --> 50:05.480]  Is there any type of metabolite differences
[50:05.480 --> 50:07.280]  or is it just something totally unrelated?
[50:07.280 --> 50:09.080]  So great question.
[50:09.080 --> 50:11.120]  This is kind of why, you know,
[50:11.120 --> 50:13.200]  I tell people when we're really talking about cannabis,
[50:13.200 --> 50:15.960]  most of us are only talking about glandular trichomes.
[50:15.960 --> 50:19.200]  We're only talking about the metabolites that are produced.
[50:19.200 --> 50:22.760]  You know, we kind of leave seed and fiber and grain,
[50:22.760 --> 50:23.880]  the really, really, you know,
[50:23.880 --> 50:26.080]  big potential industries, we leave them out.
[50:26.080 --> 50:28.000]  But I think if we're gonna continue talking
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  about floral cannabis and increasing its supply chain
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.920]  across the country, I think we need more
[50:32.920 --> 50:35.600]  of an agronomic plant science focused
[50:35.600 --> 50:39.120]  rather than, you know, traditionally cannabis research
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.280]  would have been more drug focused.
[50:41.280 --> 50:44.680]  So I think there may be one more.
[50:44.680 --> 50:46.920]  Are you aware of any research that indicates
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.800]  the optimal environment is to dry and cure cannabis
[50:50.800 --> 50:52.240]  such as temperature, humidity,
[50:52.240 --> 50:54.280]  and gaseous content of the air?
[50:55.640 --> 50:58.000]  I will send Louise some research after this
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.960]  that's gonna be available.
[50:59.960 --> 51:02.400]  It's not my research, but there is research
[51:02.400 --> 51:04.480]  that has different opinions on optimal environment.
[51:04.480 --> 51:06.040]  But again, I think that's one
[51:06.040 --> 51:07.320]  of the beautiful things about this.
[51:07.320 --> 51:09.360]  If I say the optimal environment to dry,
[51:09.360 --> 51:12.160]  the optimal environment to dry what cultivar?
[51:12.160 --> 51:14.160]  At what age was it harvested?
[51:14.160 --> 51:15.920]  What is the floral architecture?
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.760]  Literally, does the airflow make a difference?
[51:17.760 --> 51:19.840]  Is this one more prone to bud rot
[51:19.840 --> 51:22.840]  because its floral architecture is tighter and denser?
[51:22.840 --> 51:24.120]  So I don't wanna avoid your question,
[51:24.120 --> 51:25.480]  but I also don't wanna be misleading
[51:25.480 --> 51:27.160]  because I think we have a lot of people online
[51:27.160 --> 51:28.760]  as experts kind of saying,
[51:28.760 --> 51:30.760]  this is the absolute best way to do it
[51:30.760 --> 51:33.040]  and you should only do it within these parameters.
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.080]  And I think what people should do
[51:34.080 --> 51:37.480]  is start harvesting small samples of your plants
[51:37.480 --> 51:38.720]  and you should start testing them
[51:38.720 --> 51:41.200]  in a kind of a linear fashion.
[51:41.200 --> 51:45.240]  We tested it at 40% humidity, 50% humidity, 60% humidity.
[51:45.240 --> 51:47.440]  And we looked at the content afterwards.
[51:47.440 --> 51:48.520]  We looked at the trichomes,
[51:48.520 --> 51:50.720]  we looked at the cannabinoid concentration
[51:50.720 --> 51:53.000]  and then you make your own kind of in-house research
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.680]  and development because that's what we need right now.
[51:56.840 --> 51:58.720]  Oh, I got another one.
[51:58.720 --> 52:00.320]  All right.
[52:00.320 --> 52:02.680]  Can you compare indoor versus outdoor production
[52:02.720 --> 52:03.560]  of trichomes?
[52:03.560 --> 52:04.400]  Is it different?
[52:05.880 --> 52:09.160]  So the research says that based on,
[52:09.160 --> 52:11.080]  so again, the purpose of these trichomes, right?
[52:11.080 --> 52:11.920]  Think about it.
[52:11.920 --> 52:15.080]  They're environmental, excuse me.
[52:15.080 --> 52:16.280]  They're environmental protectors,
[52:16.280 --> 52:18.680]  whether it be the non-glandular that are physical barriers
[52:18.680 --> 52:21.520]  or the glandular that are these kinds of
[52:21.520 --> 52:23.880]  chemical biofactories that are essentially
[52:23.880 --> 52:25.880]  extending from the plant surface.
[52:26.960 --> 52:29.840]  So the research that I've seen,
[52:29.840 --> 52:34.840]  there is a major difference between the type of radiation
[52:34.960 --> 52:37.640]  or light spectrum that it's exposed to.
[52:37.640 --> 52:40.120]  So UV radiation or shorter wavelength,
[52:40.120 --> 52:43.560]  higher energy radiation seems to increase
[52:43.560 --> 52:47.000]  the production of trichomes, which theoretically,
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.720]  if you could take the same cultivar, clone it,
[52:49.720 --> 52:51.320]  put one indoor, one outdoor,
[52:51.320 --> 52:52.600]  if you could measure that,
[52:53.800 --> 52:56.240]  if you could measure that PAR radiation,
[52:56.240 --> 52:59.080]  if for lack of better words,
[52:59.080 --> 53:00.360]  and compare those two,
[53:00.360 --> 53:02.000]  I'm sure you would see some type of differences,
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.680]  but again, it's so different in each different cultivar.
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.960]  So I got all 11 out the way.
[53:09.960 --> 53:11.960]  Is there anything else I'm not to check?
[53:13.040 --> 53:15.760]  Yeah, so thank you so much for your presentation, Steve.
[53:15.760 --> 53:16.960]  It was a great presentation.
[53:16.960 --> 53:18.240]  Thank you for answering all these questions.
[53:18.240 --> 53:20.800]  I'm pretty sure that the audience is pleased
[53:20.800 --> 53:23.200]  that we were able to get to all the questions.
[53:24.320 --> 53:25.640]  Well, thank you so much, everyone.
[53:25.640 --> 53:27.080]  Thank you, Steve, once again.
[53:28.080 --> 53:31.600]  Please join us next in two weeks, actually,
[53:31.600 --> 53:33.680]  for our last webinar.
[53:33.680 --> 53:35.280]  It will be on May 3rd,
[53:35.280 --> 53:38.080]  and this will be focused on hemp processing,
[53:38.080 --> 53:41.600]  extraction, and testing by Jamila Lamalfa-Dunlop
[53:41.600 --> 53:45.920]  from Averys-Wythe University, I believe.
[53:45.920 --> 53:47.400]  That's how you pronounce it.
[53:47.400 --> 53:50.800]  So yeah, thank you so much.
[53:55.720 --> 53:59.200]  This has been a production of Cornell University.
