[00:00.190 --> 00:04.190]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:04.190 --> 00:10.610]  And now we're going to have a panel presentation,
[00:10.610 --> 00:13.610]  and I would like to call up to the front desk, please,
[00:13.610 --> 00:16.610]  those who will be part of this panel.
[00:16.610 --> 00:21.610]  So Chris Loesch, Dr. Nyberg, Dr. Beyanz, Dr. Hoffman,
[00:21.610 --> 00:24.610]  and Dr. Quaintance, please,
[00:24.610 --> 00:26.610]  if you would come join us here in the front.
[00:26.610 --> 00:29.610]  We'll get ready for this next session,
[00:29.610 --> 00:30.610]  which is entitled
[00:30.610 --> 00:33.610]  Researching Hemp's Potential in the State of New York,
[00:33.610 --> 00:35.610]  which we will highlight some success stories
[00:35.610 --> 00:40.610]  and discuss the path forward for the work that they've done so far.
[00:40.610 --> 00:43.610]  Now, while they're coming up to the front,
[00:43.610 --> 00:48.610]  I hope you've noticed on your seats you might have found 3x5 cards.
[00:48.610 --> 00:52.610]  As part of this discussion, I will introduce each person,
[00:52.610 --> 00:55.610]  and they will speak for a few minutes.
[00:56.610 --> 01:00.610]  But while you are listening to them, as questions emerge,
[01:00.610 --> 01:05.610]  please write them on your 3x5 card and then raise your hand.
[01:05.610 --> 01:09.610]  We have Julie Suarez and Tim Sweeney
[01:09.610 --> 01:12.610]  who will pick up your cards while you're writing them.
[01:12.610 --> 01:15.610]  So continue to fill out extra cards
[01:15.610 --> 01:18.610]  and turn them in as questions arise.
[01:18.610 --> 01:19.610]  Now, here's the trick.
[01:19.610 --> 01:23.610]  In case we don't get to your question during this panel session,
[01:23.610 --> 01:25.610]  please put your name and an e-mail address
[01:25.610 --> 01:28.610]  or a phone number on the card as well,
[01:28.610 --> 01:30.610]  and we'll make sure that we get back to you
[01:30.610 --> 01:34.610]  with an answer to your question, even if it doesn't happen today.
[01:34.610 --> 01:40.610]  So please use those 3x5 cards to fill out questions.
[01:40.610 --> 01:43.610]  Raise your hand as soon as you're ready to have that question picked up.
[01:43.610 --> 01:47.610]  We'll have someone pick it up on the side and bring them on up.
[01:47.610 --> 01:50.610]  If we don't get your question today, however, don't worry.
[01:50.610 --> 01:52.610]  We will get back to you.
[01:52.610 --> 01:59.610]  Now I would like to start with our presenters on this panel this afternoon,
[01:59.610 --> 02:02.610]  and I'll introduce each person as we go along.
[02:02.610 --> 02:06.610]  They'll speak for a few minutes, and then we'll move to the next.
[02:06.610 --> 02:10.610]  Our first speaker is Chris Loge from the Department of Agriculture and Markets,
[02:10.610 --> 02:13.610]  and he will speak about the current state
[02:13.610 --> 02:17.610]  and federal regulatory framework surrounding industrial hemp.
[02:17.610 --> 02:18.610]  Thank you very much.
[02:18.610 --> 02:19.610]  Thank you very much.
[02:19.610 --> 02:23.610]  I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and talk with you.
[02:23.610 --> 02:27.610]  And I guess just by way of starting out, you know,
[02:27.610 --> 02:32.610]  when I came to the Department of Agriculture and Markets a little over three years ago,
[02:32.610 --> 02:36.610]  I guess it is, this program was not on the horizon
[02:36.610 --> 02:40.610]  and not something that I ever thought I'd have the opportunity to work on.
[02:40.610 --> 02:46.610]  It's been quite a learning curve and really exciting an opportunity,
[02:46.610 --> 02:52.610]  and I appreciate the opportunity to have spoken to so many folks about industrial hemp over the past year or so,
[02:52.610 --> 02:57.610]  and now today being able to put some faces to those names.
[02:57.610 --> 03:00.610]  I'm just going to talk a little bit about the regulatory stage,
[03:00.610 --> 03:05.610]  and then I'll pass this along to the other presenters.
[03:05.610 --> 03:12.610]  And later on, Scott Weiner and I will talk specifically about sort of where the regulations are headed.
[03:12.610 --> 03:19.610]  But basically on the federal level, I think we all know that the 2014 Farm Bill authorized state departments of agriculture
[03:19.610 --> 03:27.610]  and institutions of higher education to run these research pilot programs in states where there was a law that allowed it.
[03:27.610 --> 03:35.610]  I think one of the very important things for everybody to keep in mind on this is the way that the Farm Bill reads
[03:35.610 --> 03:41.610]  is that it allows us to do research pilot programs versus commercialization.
[03:41.610 --> 03:46.610]  Now, on the other hand, there's not really a definition of a research pilot program in the Farm Bill,
[03:46.610 --> 03:54.610]  nor is there a definition of what commercialization is, so I think we have some room to work there.
[03:54.610 --> 04:03.610]  And so there is a certain amount of regulatory discretion there that I think is helpful to us as we move forward.
[04:03.610 --> 04:11.610]  Sort of the second building block, if you will, on the federal side of things is the Omnibus Budget Bill of 2016.
[04:11.610 --> 04:19.610]  And that Omnibus Budget Bill prohibited the DEA from using their program appropriations for enforcement efforts.
[04:19.610 --> 04:24.610]  And again, that does give us a little bit of discretion there as well.
[04:25.610 --> 04:29.610]  I think one of the things that we need to be clear on also, though,
[04:29.610 --> 04:38.610]  is just because they can't use their appropriation on enforcement doesn't necessarily make everything legal.
[04:38.610 --> 04:43.610]  But on the other hand, there's, again, a lot of regulatory discretion that we have.
[04:43.610 --> 04:46.610]  And I think it circles back around to what the Farm Bill says,
[04:46.610 --> 04:53.610]  where as long as we're working on a research pilot program, we're on good, firm ground.
[04:53.610 --> 05:03.610]  So the final piece or building block on the federal side is a program guidance document that came out in July of 2016
[05:03.610 --> 05:09.610]  from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Food and Drug Administration, and USDA.
[05:09.610 --> 05:15.610]  And that document provides some very general guidance on what is and what is not okay.
[05:15.610 --> 05:19.610]  And again, we have to keep in mind it's a program guidance document.
[05:19.610 --> 05:23.610]  It does not necessarily have force of law behind it.
[05:23.610 --> 05:28.610]  Now a little bit more onto our purview here on the state side.
[05:28.610 --> 05:30.610]  And again, I alluded to this a moment ago.
[05:30.610 --> 05:34.610]  Research has a very, very broad definition.
[05:34.610 --> 05:44.610]  And what we've seen selected or awarded so far are projects that focus on the agronomic characteristics of the crop,
[05:44.610 --> 05:50.610]  processing, the beginnings of some manufacturing technology.
[05:50.610 --> 05:54.610]  But another really important thing that I think we're all very, very interested in
[05:54.610 --> 06:03.610]  and we want to see some data built on is some economics on the cost of production and the returns on the crop as well.
[06:03.610 --> 06:08.610]  So as we're looking going forward in the future when we're looking at projects,
[06:08.610 --> 06:17.610]  we're going to want, you know, well thought out research questions that add to sort of the foundation of this industry
[06:17.610 --> 06:25.610]  and give producers the information they need from the agronomic side as well as the economic side.
[06:25.610 --> 06:33.610]  And also very, very important is that we want to have processing and manufacturing coming online sort of in the same proportions,
[06:33.610 --> 06:36.610]  if you will, as we have production.
[06:36.610 --> 06:45.610]  If you look a little bit at the history of how this crop progressed in Canada over the last 20 years is when Canada legalized hemp,
[06:45.610 --> 06:49.610]  you had a great deal of production.
[06:49.610 --> 06:57.610]  And as production came up ahead of the manufacturing being in line, they did see prices decrease.
[06:57.610 --> 07:03.610]  And so over time, that has sort of equalized and it's become a pretty good crop up in Canada.
[07:03.610 --> 07:08.610]  So we have to keep all these different things in mind.
[07:08.610 --> 07:13.610]  As has been said a lot today and this morning, we've been trying to be very,
[07:13.610 --> 07:20.610]  very creative in the division of plant industry on how we handle this program.
[07:20.610 --> 07:24.610]  We're trying very, very hard to take an open-minded approach.
[07:24.610 --> 07:27.610]  And I think we've been very, very flexible so far with the industry.
[07:27.610 --> 07:32.610]  We have all intentions of continuing that as we go forward.
[07:32.610 --> 07:40.610]  What we really want to have as we go forward under the current regulatory constraints that we have from the federal perspective
[07:40.610 --> 07:45.610]  is some level of safety for our participants or our program partners,
[07:45.610 --> 07:50.610]  as well as for the department and other folks that are involved in this.
[07:50.610 --> 07:55.610]  So kind of think of it as we're trying to build a program that is, for all intents and purposes,
[07:55.610 --> 07:59.610]  a safe harbor for the participants.
[07:59.610 --> 08:08.610]  We're really very committed, again, to position the industry for the day when the federal regulatory environment relaxes.
[08:08.610 --> 08:16.610]  And so those are sort of the philosophical pieces that we're using as we frame this program out going forward.
[08:16.610 --> 08:23.610]  Thank you.
[08:23.610 --> 08:26.610]  Our next speaker this afternoon is Dr. Don Vianz,
[08:26.610 --> 08:32.610]  and Don is Associate Dean and Director of Academic Programs in the College of Agriculture
[08:32.610 --> 08:36.610]  and Life Sciences at Cornell in addition to being a plant breeder.
[08:36.610 --> 08:42.610]  Now, Don has firsthand experience regarding the paperwork that is involved in starting up a new trial,
[08:42.610 --> 08:48.610]  and he has some photos to share with us of the first hemp trial here at Cornell.
[08:48.610 --> 08:55.610]  And this crop was planted at the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station in 2016.
[08:55.610 --> 08:56.610]  So, Don, please.
[08:56.610 --> 08:58.610]  Thank you, Catherine.
[08:58.610 --> 09:04.610]  So this last summer we did receive some funding from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets
[09:04.610 --> 09:09.610]  to compare varieties of industrial hemp for the New York conditions.
[09:09.610 --> 09:15.610]  And as you see on the slide there, the first group of three names there are those of us on our research project.
[09:15.610 --> 09:17.610]  We're actually a forage breeding research project,
[09:17.610 --> 09:21.610]  but we got into industrial hemp research just this past growing season.
[09:21.610 --> 09:29.610]  And then the second list of three names are people up at the Cornell Experiment Station at Geneva,
[09:29.610 --> 09:32.610]  and they've become very much interested in industrial hemp as well.
[09:32.610 --> 09:35.610]  So we're forming a bigger team as time goes along.
[09:35.610 --> 09:41.610]  But I want to restrict my remarks just to the comparison of industrial hemp varieties for right now.
[09:41.610 --> 09:49.610]  This is a list of the types of characteristics that we're interested in that might expand as we get into the next growing season.
[09:49.610 --> 09:56.610]  But basically biomass yield for the grain types of varieties, we, of course, want to look at the yield of the grain or the seed.
[09:56.610 --> 09:59.610]  The fiber types of varieties, we'll be looking at the fiber.
[09:59.610 --> 10:03.610]  Various quality components such as fatty acids, proteins, and so forth.
[10:03.610 --> 10:07.610]  And through the growing season, especially after establishment,
[10:07.610 --> 10:12.610]  it's important that there's a good, thick plant stand density.
[10:12.610 --> 10:17.610]  And so we'll be looking at that just a few weeks after planting and throughout the growing season,
[10:17.610 --> 10:25.610]  because without that good stand of hemp, the stand is just not going to yield its maximum production.
[10:25.610 --> 10:29.610]  So that's a very important component of the whole process.
[10:29.610 --> 10:33.610]  We'll be looking at plant height through the growing season, flowering date,
[10:33.610 --> 10:40.610]  Any kind of factors that might inhibit the maximum production, such as diseases and insects, weed pressure,
[10:40.610 --> 10:44.610]  anything, we'll be making observations on these trials.
[10:44.610 --> 10:53.610]  For the fiber types especially, we'll be separating out the two major types of fiber that have different industrial uses, the bast and the herd.
[10:53.610 --> 10:59.610]  And as we went through the growing season, we did have to go through some regulatory channels.
[10:59.610 --> 11:04.610]  By the time we realized that we were having funding to do these trials,
[11:04.610 --> 11:12.610]  then we had to go through a tandem process of regulatory channels there, not only at the state, but mostly at the federal level,
[11:12.610 --> 11:15.610]  that kind of slowed things down a little bit.
[11:15.610 --> 11:23.610]  And so by the time we had the final import permit for obtaining seed, it was actually at the end of August and early September.
[11:23.610 --> 11:27.610]  Obviously way too late to be able to plant any trials to get meaningful data.
[11:27.610 --> 11:32.610]  But my research crew decided to plant a few varieties in a small trial anyway,
[11:32.610 --> 11:38.610]  just so that we could get some experience on establishing a trial so that this next growing season,
[11:38.610 --> 11:44.610]  in fact a month from now when we plant larger trials, we'll have some experience doing that.
[11:44.610 --> 11:51.610]  So it was really kind of interesting to watch the plant stands of these trials as they were planted.
[11:51.610 --> 11:54.610]  They were two separate trials with two different planters.
[11:54.610 --> 12:02.610]  One was the forage seeder that we use on our forage breeding project that just barely has a little bit of soil over top of the seed,
[12:02.610 --> 12:04.610]  so very shallow depth.
[12:04.610 --> 12:12.610]  In contrast to that was the grain drill that our small grains breeding project uses that places a seed usually at a better depth,
[12:12.610 --> 12:15.610]  three-quarters to maybe one inch.
[12:15.610 --> 12:21.610]  Right after the, well, you remember last growing season, it was just really dry growing season.
[12:21.610 --> 12:26.610]  And so the crew irrigated the trial, but soon after that we got a lot of rain.
[12:26.610 --> 12:33.610]  So the result of that was crusting of the ground, a crust of layer, a layer of crust right at the surface,
[12:33.610 --> 12:41.610]  that wasn't bad for the low depth of seeding, but with the grain drill it was quite a contrast.
[12:41.610 --> 12:48.610]  Very few plants came up through that crust with that deeper planting.
[12:48.610 --> 12:54.610]  A month later you can see that we had a pretty nice stand with the shallow planting,
[12:54.610 --> 12:58.610]  but with the grain drill that was deeper, the stand would not have been very productive
[12:58.610 --> 13:01.610]  if this were a complete growing season that we went through.
[13:01.610 --> 13:04.610]  So it doesn't mean that the grain drill is not the proper type of equipment,
[13:04.610 --> 13:09.610]  but it means that we have to be really careful with the depth of planting.
[13:09.610 --> 13:15.610]  Because it was planted so late, it was interesting to watch these young seedlings go into the fall
[13:15.610 --> 13:19.610]  and to find out what temperatures would actually kill them.
[13:19.610 --> 13:24.610]  And it wasn't until well into November when the temperatures got down to maybe the mid-20s at nighttime
[13:24.610 --> 13:28.610]  that we started seeing plants kill out.
[13:28.610 --> 13:34.610]  And of course as you can see here, this is a few weeks later in early December when they're totally dead.
[13:34.610 --> 13:39.610]  So this next season, in fact in another month or so, we'll be planting three locations.
[13:39.610 --> 13:42.610]  Originally we were planning just to plant at Ithaca,
[13:42.610 --> 13:47.610]  but now that both Chris and Larry Smart have gained interest in this,
[13:47.610 --> 13:50.610]  they will have two trials up at Geneva on two different soil types.
[13:50.610 --> 13:52.610]  So essentially three locations.
[13:52.610 --> 13:58.610]  They'll be right in our home base so that we can keep a careful watch on it almost on a daily basis.
[13:58.610 --> 14:02.610]  At each location we'll have two types of trials side by side.
[14:02.610 --> 14:05.610]  We'll have a trial with only the fiber types,
[14:05.610 --> 14:09.610]  and then a trial with the grain types and the dual types for both fiber and grain.
[14:09.610 --> 14:13.610]  So we'll be able to make proper comparisons of those types of varieties.
[14:13.610 --> 14:20.610]  We were fortunate in that there was a student at SUNY-Cobleskill who is a plant science major,
[14:20.610 --> 14:25.610]  and she's due to graduate, but she needs an internship experience in order to do that.
[14:25.610 --> 14:31.610]  So she learned of our hemp project and contacted me about a month and a half ago.
[14:31.610 --> 14:37.610]  She came up for a visit about four weeks ago with Julie, Jamie, and myself on a research project,
[14:37.610 --> 14:40.610]  and things really clicked off.
[14:40.610 --> 14:42.610]  I'm sure she'll be coming to do the internship,
[14:42.610 --> 14:47.610]  and what we plan for her to do is to focus mostly on the industrial hemp trials,
[14:47.610 --> 14:54.610]  to keep a watch on it, to collect data, make any observations that we need to have on those trials.
[14:54.610 --> 14:58.610]  So it'll be a win-win situation for us, but also for her,
[14:58.610 --> 15:03.610]  because she'll be able to learn a lot about production of industrial hemp through this experience.
[15:03.610 --> 15:09.610]  Jamie Crawford on our project has already been communicating with various people around the college
[15:09.610 --> 15:15.610]  in hopes of developing a website that we can begin putting some information there for various stakeholders,
[15:15.610 --> 15:23.610]  and perhaps Amelia, our intern, will contribute to placing some materials on that website once it's up and running.
[15:23.610 --> 15:27.610]  I'm sure that there will be plenty of people who are interested in seeing these trials through the summer,
[15:27.610 --> 15:33.610]  so at both Geneva and Ithaca, we will accommodate any tours that people want to have.
[15:33.610 --> 15:39.610]  And the last thing that I might comment is that as the summer went on
[15:39.610 --> 15:42.610]  and we began to be involved in the research process,
[15:42.610 --> 15:47.610]  it was interesting that not a week went by until well into the fall months
[15:47.610 --> 15:50.610]  that at least one grower across New York State contacted me
[15:50.610 --> 15:53.610]  and expressed interest in growing industrial hemp.
[15:53.610 --> 15:57.610]  In fact, we had a few people from the industry contacting as well.
[15:57.610 --> 15:59.610]  We are not quite ready for that.
[15:59.610 --> 16:03.610]  Again, we want to keep close to home, but with the additional funding,
[16:03.610 --> 16:06.610]  we do have plans to expand that across New York State
[16:06.610 --> 16:12.610]  because we have a lot of microclimates and a lot of soil types to evaluate these varieties in.
[16:12.610 --> 16:14.610]  So, Catherine, I'll end right there.
[16:14.610 --> 16:16.610]  Terrific. Thank you, Don.
[16:17.610 --> 16:21.610]  All right. Our next speaker is Dr. Chris Nyberg,
[16:21.610 --> 16:25.610]  who is Dean of the School of Agriculture at SUNY Morrisville.
[16:25.610 --> 16:28.610]  And Dr. Nyberg will be sharing with us some reflections
[16:28.610 --> 16:32.610]  on how SUNY Morrisville's hemp partnership this past year with JD Farms
[16:32.610 --> 16:38.610]  has opened the door for new teaching and research and student involvement at SUNY Morrisville.
[16:38.610 --> 16:40.610]  So, Dr. Nyberg.
[16:40.610 --> 16:43.610]  Thank you, Catherine.
[16:43.610 --> 16:45.610]  Thank you for the opportunity to be here.
[16:45.610 --> 16:50.610]  We jumped at the opportunity when JD Farms approached us
[16:50.610 --> 16:55.610]  when the opportunity for universities to apply for the research license came about.
[16:55.610 --> 16:58.610]  There was no funding supporting the research.
[16:58.610 --> 17:01.610]  So, without the partnership with industry, with JD Farms,
[17:01.610 --> 17:04.610]  we would not have been able to do what we've done.
[17:04.610 --> 17:07.610]  So, it was an exciting opportunity for us.
[17:07.610 --> 17:12.610]  Our research was totally funded by our farming partner,
[17:12.610 --> 17:16.610]  both laboratory equipment to support some of the soil science research,
[17:16.610 --> 17:18.610]  all of the field operations,
[17:18.610 --> 17:22.610]  and it has had an effect across a number of our academic programs.
[17:22.610 --> 17:25.610]  Morrisville is a 100% teaching institution.
[17:25.610 --> 17:28.610]  Our faculty have a 100% teaching appointment.
[17:28.610 --> 17:33.610]  But we do have a lot of applied research activity that we try and involve our students in.
[17:33.610 --> 17:35.610]  So, when the research questions came up,
[17:35.610 --> 17:39.610]  we were looking initially at the first year production.
[17:39.610 --> 17:41.610]  JD Farms is an organic farm.
[17:41.610 --> 17:48.610]  So, the first year was looking at various manure nutrient sources with four plots.
[17:48.610 --> 17:50.610]  Had some issues that confounded that research.
[17:50.610 --> 17:55.610]  But the other opportunities, our renewable energy program wanted to look at biodiesel production.
[17:55.610 --> 18:00.610]  Our students just produced their first test batch of biodiesel this last week
[18:00.610 --> 18:03.610]  with seeds grown last year at JD Farms.
[18:03.610 --> 18:05.610]  Over the course of the year and this winter,
[18:05.610 --> 18:09.610]  the research questions have expanded to greenhouse growing for baby greens,
[18:09.610 --> 18:15.610]  and that again came from JD Farms' interest and their partnership with Satter Farms.
[18:15.610 --> 18:22.610]  And our culinary program and our horticulture students have been doing some baby green production in the greenhouse,
[18:22.610 --> 18:25.610]  and of course some test tastings in the culinary program.
[18:25.610 --> 18:30.610]  So, it's been an exciting opportunity across multiple curriculums.
[18:30.610 --> 18:34.610]  We have a number of large animal science programs, equine and dairy.
[18:34.610 --> 18:38.610]  Over the next few years, we're looking at the bedding opportunities for that as well.
[18:38.610 --> 18:45.610]  So, I have just a few slides showing our production from last year.
[18:45.610 --> 18:52.610]  So, the original study question was nutrient sources using the manure for the organic farm application last year.
[18:52.610 --> 18:54.610]  At what application rates?
[18:54.610 --> 18:57.610]  This was seeding day.
[18:57.610 --> 19:00.610]  It was difficult to get to this point.
[19:00.610 --> 19:07.610]  The permit application was the application for getting the research approval through the DEA.
[19:07.610 --> 19:09.610]  It took a while.
[19:09.610 --> 19:12.610]  The DEA seemed very aggressive initially.
[19:12.610 --> 19:16.610]  Local was more difficult than federal.
[19:16.610 --> 19:25.610]  The biggest and most onerous piece was the request to have the seed after importation under armed guard until it was in the ground,
[19:25.610 --> 19:29.610]  which became costly and onerous.
[19:29.610 --> 19:33.610]  So, when the seed finally came, we had a first dry day after it arrived.
[19:33.610 --> 19:41.610]  After 45 days of armed guard observation on the seed, we were able to put it in the ground on July 3rd, which happened to be a Sunday.
[19:41.610 --> 19:48.610]  So, you should see that Sunday, 4th of July weekend, it was a family affair with Dan and Mark from JD Farms,
[19:48.610 --> 19:58.610]  and Mark's wife and Dr. Jen Gilbert Jenkins, our agronomist from Morrisville, and her children.
[19:58.610 --> 20:03.610]  By July 7th, just four days, seedlings were up.
[20:03.610 --> 20:08.610]  These were planted with a typical John Deere grain drill.
[20:08.610 --> 20:11.610]  July 26th, you're seeing pretty good growth.
[20:11.610 --> 20:15.610]  July 29th, we've got some flowering.
[20:15.610 --> 20:17.610]  This was irrigated. It was a very dry summer.
[20:17.610 --> 20:24.610]  JD Farms invested in an irrigation unit to ensure the survival of the crop.
[20:24.610 --> 20:28.610]  August 9th, you're seeing quite a lot of production.
[20:28.610 --> 20:32.610]  Pretty good stand. It was a total of 30 acres.
[20:32.610 --> 20:40.610]  Our agronomy students, in collaboration with Dr. Gilbert Jenkins, were doing soil testing throughout the summer and fall,
[20:40.610 --> 20:47.610]  and we were able to harvest sometime later in September with conventional combine equipment
[20:47.610 --> 20:54.610]  in collaboration with JD Farms, who worked with GN4T Farms to do the harvesting.
[20:54.610 --> 20:57.610]  So, year one, grain yield varied.
[20:57.610 --> 21:01.610]  It was quite variable from 11 to 28 bushels per acre.
[21:01.610 --> 21:05.610]  There was quite a lot of weed pressure, confounding the manure applications.
[21:05.610 --> 21:12.610]  It had been former organic hay field that was tilled to put this in just prior to planting.
[21:12.610 --> 21:15.610]  Average yield ended up 16 bushels per acre,
[21:15.610 --> 21:23.610]  and the fiber was baled, a total of 36 large and 9 small square bales from the 30 acres of hemp.
[21:23.610 --> 21:33.610]  Here you're seeing that there was quite a lot of weed contamination in the stand and some pest issues.
[21:33.610 --> 21:44.480]  So, production suggestions in terms of nitrogen per acre,
[21:45.480 --> 21:49.480]  and this is one of the research questions that we were planning to look on in the future,
[21:49.480 --> 21:59.480]  definitely based on soil type and going with conventional fertilizers, not just the organic manure applications.
[21:59.480 --> 22:03.480]  Here you're seeing that there were pests on the plants.
[22:03.480 --> 22:08.480]  We've heard from other states that Japanese beetles are an issue.
[22:08.480 --> 22:12.480]  Although our stand had quite a lot of Japanese beetles in the stand,
[22:12.480 --> 22:15.480]  we didn't see pest damage to the hemp plant.
[22:15.480 --> 22:18.480]  We saw it on the weeds that happened to be in the field.
[22:20.480 --> 22:24.480]  So, the baby green question will be looked at going forward.
[22:24.480 --> 22:31.480]  The pest issues, although we didn't have a pest issue in terms of pressure on the plant,
[22:31.480 --> 22:34.480]  we're looking at that going forward,
[22:35.480 --> 22:41.480]  and want to look at the bedding opportunities as well as continuing the biofuel opportunities.
[22:43.480 --> 22:50.480]  Here's where I mentioned expanding the nitrogen research in organic fertilizers for more precise application rates,
[22:50.480 --> 22:59.480]  and there definitely needs to be collaboration for farms statewide because of soil types and nitrogen yield response.
[23:00.480 --> 23:06.480]  This year the plan is to continue collaborating with JD Farms and go to 100 acres
[23:06.480 --> 23:11.480]  with both some till and no-till practices in those 100 acres.
[23:13.480 --> 23:14.480]  Thank you.
[23:14.480 --> 23:15.480]  Terrific.
[23:15.480 --> 23:19.480]  Applause
[23:19.480 --> 23:24.480]  So a reminder please, if you have questions, write them on your 3x5 cards and hold them in the air
[23:24.480 --> 23:28.480]  so that we can collect them and bring them up front.
[23:28.480 --> 23:35.480]  Our next speaker is Interim President Jay Quaintance from Sullivan Community College,
[23:35.480 --> 23:41.480]  and his community college has just received a permit for industrial hemp cultivation.
[23:41.480 --> 23:47.480]  He has a really interesting partnership proposed with a local not-for-profit that serves the needs of autistic children.
[23:47.480 --> 23:50.480]  So, we would love to hear from you, Dr. Quaintance.
[23:51.480 --> 23:56.480]  Thank you, Catherine, and thank you all for coming out to hear what's going on around the state
[23:56.480 --> 23:58.480]  with the hemp project.
[23:58.480 --> 24:03.480]  We are very excited at SUNY Sullivan to partner with the Center for Discovery,
[24:03.480 --> 24:10.480]  which as was mentioned is an educational and medical facility that serves the needs of students
[24:10.480 --> 24:17.480]  and individuals with disabilities across the autism spectrum, but also medically frail individuals.
[24:17.480 --> 24:24.480]  And one of the areas that this really world-renowned research center works in
[24:24.480 --> 24:32.480]  is the effects of diet and a very holistic approach to how we deal with folks with these kinds of disabilities.
[24:32.480 --> 24:38.480]  And they operate a pretty extensive biodynamic farm on their property and in other areas around the county.
[24:38.480 --> 24:46.480]  So when they approached SUNY Sullivan as a partner in an industrial hemp experimental program,
[24:46.480 --> 24:51.480]  one of the things that we were really interested in was working with them across the idea of this biodynamic farming.
[24:51.480 --> 24:56.480]  And for those of you who aren't really familiar, biodynamic farming has a lot in common with organic farming,
[24:56.480 --> 25:03.480]  but it's really much more of a philosophical approach to growing things in which the entire farm is created
[25:03.480 --> 25:11.480]  and treated as a living organism with the livestock and the crops and the green spaces between the crops
[25:11.480 --> 25:19.480]  all treated as essentially organs of a more holistic living organism.
[25:19.480 --> 25:25.480]  So one of the things that we're really hopeful about is that this biodynamic farming method
[25:25.480 --> 25:30.480]  will have a positive impact on CBD production in the finished product.
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.480]  So we're working in conjunction with the Center for Discovery.
[25:34.480 --> 25:39.480]  We're also working with C.W. Hemp and the Stanley Brothers from Colorado.
[25:39.480 --> 25:46.480]  And we're working with the University at Buffalo Pharmacy School to really provide our students
[25:46.480 --> 25:53.480]  with an opportunity on the growing side and on the chemical analysis side of the finished product.
[25:53.480 --> 26:00.480]  It fits with our work at SUNY Sullivan in that we have a very, one of our main focuses is on sustainability
[26:00.480 --> 26:04.480]  and really creating a sustainable environment within the county and for our students.
[26:04.480 --> 26:11.480]  And so modeling this idea of a holistic approach to both feeding ourselves and treating ourselves
[26:11.480 --> 26:16.480]  as living individuals within a larger ecosystem is really appealing to us.
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.480]  We have a green building technologies program. We have a culinary arts program.
[26:20.480 --> 26:25.480]  And as was mentioned, you know, we were just granted the permit, so we're really in the process of scoping out
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.480]  what the MOU is going to look like between the four partnership entities
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.480]  and how each of the entities is going to be able to bring to bear what their resources are
[26:34.480 --> 26:38.480]  as well as provide opportunities to benefit them.
[26:38.480 --> 26:45.480]  Our students are very excited. Our faculty are absolutely thrilled to be working with the Center for Discovery
[26:45.480 --> 26:52.480]  and the folks at UB, and we're really looking forward to moving this project and really creating a proof point
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.480]  that these very innovative and nontraditional farming methods can have a positive outcome
[26:58.480 --> 27:04.480]  and a positive impact on this exciting new field moving forward in New York.
[27:05.480 --> 27:08.480]  Thank you. Terrific. And, yes.
[27:08.480 --> 27:18.480]  And last but far from least, we will hear from Dr. Eric Hoffman from the School of the emerging School of Pharmacy
[27:18.480 --> 27:23.480]  from Binghamton University. Now, Dr. Hoffman is an authority on drug development
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.480]  and Binghamton University is a new recipient of a research permit.
[27:27.480 --> 27:36.480]  So Dr. Hoffman will discuss for us the potential of, and I may not say this correctly, so correct me, please,
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.480]  but cannabidoil, am I close? Am I putting the accent in the right place? Close enough?
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.480]  Cannabidoil, okay. Isolated from industrial hemp as an emerging treatment for epilepsy.
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.480]  So we're looking forward to hearing from you, Dr. Hoffman.
[27:49.480 --> 27:54.480]  Sure. So as with the last speaker, this is a collaboration between two other groups,
[27:54.480 --> 28:00.480]  a group that's currently growing hemp in Kentucky called Genkana, who's here,
[28:00.480 --> 28:09.480]  as well as a local nursery grower, Nanticoke Gardens, which does both plants and also microgreens that serves local restaurants.
[28:09.480 --> 28:15.480]  And so this is, Binghamton University owns the license, which was also just recently granted,
[28:15.480 --> 28:18.480]  and this is connected with the new School of Pharmacy.
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.480]  This is a new four-story building that's going up in downtown Johnson City, right near the medical center there,
[28:24.480 --> 28:29.480]  and we enter our first class of PharmD students, so these are getting a doctorate of pharmacy
[28:29.480 --> 28:34.480]  that then go on to staff the pharmacies in the area, and we work with the local pharmacies through internship programs,
[28:34.480 --> 28:36.480]  and we enter our first class this fall.
[28:36.480 --> 28:43.480]  But it's the research-focused pharmacy school, so two of the four floors of the new building will be focused on research.
[28:43.480 --> 28:45.480]  And so I am the dean for the research.
[28:45.480 --> 28:50.480]  I was brought in from Washington, D.C. I do a lot of drug development, gene discovery.
[28:50.480 --> 28:56.480]  I've spun off three companies in different aspects of drug development, and one of the drugs we develop
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.480]  and I've moved two additional people with me from Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.,
[29:00.480 --> 29:02.480]  on different aspects of drug development.
[29:02.480 --> 29:12.480]  So this collaboration then is to look at the uses of really to develop food-grade cannabidiol, or CBD, it's called,
[29:12.480 --> 29:16.480]  and a key issue that was talked a lot about in the morning but not so much in the afternoon
[29:16.480 --> 29:23.480]  is the distinction between marijuana and the THC, which is the psychoactive component,
[29:23.480 --> 29:30.480]  and hemp, which is really a very similar plant but which has been bred to reduce the THC content to enrich for CBD,
[29:30.480 --> 29:32.480]  which is a kind of a diol.
[29:32.480 --> 29:38.480]  So really it's really important to monitor the ratios of those, and you need to keep the THC below 0.3 percent
[29:38.480 --> 29:43.480]  or you could end up in situations, and there has been, where farmers may need to burn the fields
[29:43.480 --> 29:48.480]  because of some growing condition that just raised the THC too high above that 0.3 percent.
[29:48.480 --> 29:54.480]  So what we'll do is we have purchased a million dollars of equipment to mass specs to monitor,
[29:54.480 --> 29:59.480]  and we'll set up assays that are local so we can monitor those different ratios of the different components.
[29:59.480 --> 30:04.480]  So working with Neandercoat and with Genkano, look at the different varieties under different growing conditions,
[30:04.480 --> 30:10.480]  see what those ratios are, and then decide what we're going to take forward in drug development or through foodstuffs.
[30:10.480 --> 30:17.480]  And Genkano is releasing a beverage within the next month or two, which includes CBD oil as part of that down in Kentucky.
[30:17.480 --> 30:23.480]  And so to develop that both even through the restaurants like microgreens you've heard about from others,
[30:23.480 --> 30:29.480]  but then through the drinks and the health food, but then through actual drug development for specific what's called indications or diseases.
[30:30.480 --> 30:33.480]  As was just mentioned, it is in many clinical trials.
[30:33.480 --> 30:36.480]  CBD is in many clinical trials for intractable epilepsy.
[30:36.480 --> 30:40.480]  So children with epilepsy that standard treatments are not working.
[30:40.480 --> 30:44.480]  Epilepsy, as you know, if you have too many attacks, it actually destroys your brain long term.
[30:44.480 --> 30:48.480]  So it's a big problem, high-frequency disorder.
[30:48.480 --> 30:52.480]  And so CBD has shown a lot of promise in that.
[30:52.480 --> 30:58.480]  And there's both 100% CBD and also a mixture of THC and CBD currently in clinical trials.
[30:58.480 --> 31:00.480]  That looks quite promising.
[31:00.480 --> 31:08.480]  There's already five companies that are publicly traded in this space as far as developing hemp medicinal products.
[31:08.480 --> 31:12.480]  But what we're, I think, going to focus on is looking at these ratios.
[31:12.480 --> 31:19.480]  Well, most drugs, to develop them as we have, you need a very purified single molecule that you're taking forward.
[31:19.480 --> 31:27.480]  So you can look at toxicity, you can look at efficacy, all these dot all your I's and cross your T's with the regulatory, both FDA and EMA in Europe.
[31:27.480 --> 31:28.480]  And so we've done that.
[31:28.480 --> 31:29.480]  We know how to do that.
[31:29.480 --> 31:34.480]  We've done that for three drugs and brought them now through clinical trials, this group that's now at SUNY Binghamton.
[31:34.480 --> 31:38.480]  But the question is, people realize that a lot of these mixtures actually work better.
[31:38.480 --> 31:45.480]  You know, maybe a tiny bit of THC below that 0.3 might actually help efficacy or make the epilepsy better.
[31:45.480 --> 31:47.480]  That's regulatory is more challenging.
[31:47.480 --> 31:51.480]  But their 21st Century Cures was just passed by the government in December.
[31:51.480 --> 31:55.480]  I think you've read about that, to really expedite and drug development.
[31:55.480 --> 31:57.480]  And they're loosening some of these rules.
[31:57.480 --> 32:12.480]  So I think it's a good time to look at both single components of hemp as well as mixtures of the oil of hemp in efficacy, in epilepsy, and other types of disorders, as was also heard about in terms of autism.
[32:12.480 --> 32:22.480]  And so that's what our focus is, is to leverage our drug development expertise, which is newly emerging at Binghamton and the New School of Pharmacy, with this growing hemp industry,
[32:22.480 --> 32:32.480]  and whether we're using isolated compounds under certain growing conditions and how those change, and help out the industry as far as monitoring these through testing.
[32:32.480 --> 32:33.480]  Thank you very much.
[32:33.480 --> 32:35.480]  And no surprise – yes, please.
[32:35.480 --> 32:40.010]  Great.
[32:40.010 --> 32:41.010]  No surprise.
[32:41.010 --> 32:44.010]  The group has come up with some outstanding questions.
[32:44.010 --> 32:47.010]  And, in fact, the first one is for you, Dr. Hoffman.
[32:47.010 --> 32:55.010]  And the question is, CBD oil is currently being produced from industrial hemp and sold in all 50 states as a health care product.
[32:55.010 --> 33:02.010]  There is controversy about both the legality and also the quality of the product, and some product has been contaminated.
[33:02.010 --> 33:07.010]  How does the state view the overlap between industrial hemp and health care products made from hemp?
[33:07.010 --> 33:09.010]  Is this a legal gray area?
[33:09.010 --> 33:13.010]  No, that's – really, I started touching on that, and that's a very important point.
[33:13.010 --> 33:18.010]  And the FDA itself struggles with that issue, the nutraceuticals versus the medicinal.
[33:18.010 --> 33:24.010]  And I brought up one key point previously, was are you dealing with a single purified molecule?
[33:24.010 --> 33:30.010]  So, you know, CBD is – just like THC is a single entity, so is CBD.
[33:30.010 --> 33:34.010]  But an oil from a plant is a mixture of all sorts of things.
[33:34.010 --> 33:35.010]  And, see, that's the question.
[33:35.010 --> 33:41.010]  Are you really taking the oil as a starting material to isolate just one compound that's ultra-pure?
[33:41.010 --> 33:46.010]  And there's definitions by the FDA and EMA what that purity has to be.
[33:46.010 --> 33:51.010]  Or are you able to take the mixture and then move that through the drug development program?
[33:51.010 --> 33:55.010]  Well, the problem with that is that mixture has to be reproducible.
[33:55.010 --> 34:00.010]  You can't have a mixture today from one plant or one farm that becomes a different mixture the next day,
[34:00.010 --> 34:04.010]  and you're calling it the same drug because you can't do that.
[34:04.010 --> 34:06.010]  So that's the key issue of reliability.
[34:06.010 --> 34:13.010]  And, in fact, what Nanticoke plans to do is instead of going to seeds, where seeds, because of genetics, as you know,
[34:13.010 --> 34:20.010]  can create some variability in open pollination, et cetera, which – well, I'll come back to that in a second.
[34:20.010 --> 34:23.010]  A cute point that was brought up this morning, which I'll reiterate.
[34:23.010 --> 34:26.010]  But Nanticoke is looking at vegetative growth.
[34:26.010 --> 34:33.010]  So basically taking a single clonal plant, then separating that into whole clonal fields,
[34:33.010 --> 34:37.010]  and that way could that make it much more reliable and reproducible.
[34:37.010 --> 34:44.010]  Now, obviously, you're not going to do that at a hundreds-of-acres scale for making clothes or sales,
[34:44.010 --> 34:47.010]  but for medicines that's probably feasible.
[34:47.010 --> 34:54.010]  But the one thing that was mentioned this morning just as a sidebar is that growing hemp on a large scale in New York
[34:54.010 --> 34:59.010]  could be a great antidote to marijuana farms because of the cross-pollination.
[34:59.010 --> 35:05.010]  Because basically if you cross-pollinate, you're going to kill your THC content in your neighboring marijuana farm.
[35:05.010 --> 35:10.010]  And so it's sort of a cute anecdote.
[35:10.010 --> 35:13.010]  Very interesting response there.
[35:13.010 --> 35:20.010]  The next two questions are agronomic in nature, and so we'll give some folks some opportunities to address these.
[35:20.010 --> 35:30.010]  One is, must you direct seed hemp, or can you start it indoors and transplant it out?
[35:30.010 --> 35:33.010]  I'll take a stab at that.
[35:33.010 --> 35:38.010]  I'm sure you can start it indoors and transplant it, but if you're talking about fairly large acres,
[35:38.010 --> 35:41.010]  that could be a lot of work to try to do that.
[35:41.010 --> 35:46.010]  But certainly if you started something indoors, you could get a jump on a growing season to do that.
[35:46.010 --> 35:51.010]  I think economically that would add to the inputs into production,
[35:51.010 --> 35:55.010]  but certainly it would be feasible as far as I am aware of.
[35:55.010 --> 35:56.010]  Okay. Thank you.
[35:56.010 --> 36:10.010]  And the second agronomic question here, would there less likely be weed pressure on a hemp crop if the crop followed a corn crop?
[36:10.010 --> 36:13.010]  Maybe I'll answer that one too.
[36:13.010 --> 36:16.010]  I'm not sure quite how to answer that, but I would ‑‑
[36:16.010 --> 36:22.010]  I mean, certainly with a crop rotation like that, that would help with the weed problem.
[36:22.010 --> 36:25.010]  The thing that I would be concerned about is that with corn production,
[36:25.010 --> 36:30.010]  a lot of time there are herbicides that are like atrazine types of herbicides,
[36:30.010 --> 36:37.010]  and my understanding is that could be really detrimental to trying to establish a hemp crop the following season.
[36:37.010 --> 36:43.010]  And those type of herbicides tend to remain in the soil for at least another growing season, if not two.
[36:43.010 --> 36:48.010]  So I think in most cases, unless it were organic production for corn,
[36:48.010 --> 36:54.010]  I would say it's not advisable to try to produce hemp right after a corn crop.
[36:54.010 --> 36:55.010]  Okay. Thank you.
[36:55.010 --> 37:03.010]  The next couple of questions focus really on the business aspects of growing hemp here in New York State.
[37:03.010 --> 37:07.010]  And this one is, I think, a really, really important one.
[37:07.010 --> 37:20.010]  So is growing hemp seen possibly as an acreage shift opportunity or an acreage expansion opportunity in New York State?
[37:20.010 --> 37:25.010]  So thoughts from anyone on the panel.
[37:25.010 --> 37:27.010]  I would say both.
[37:27.010 --> 37:28.010]  Okay.
[37:28.010 --> 37:36.010]  It would allow any farm to diversify their crops given changes in growing season, changes in opportunities, changes in market.
[37:36.010 --> 37:45.010]  You might see interest bringing underused ag land back, but also putting it into rotation in existing crop land.
[37:45.010 --> 37:46.010]  Terrific.
[37:46.010 --> 37:48.010]  Thoughts from anyone else?
[37:48.010 --> 37:51.010]  I would just add I think the economics have to be hammered out on it,
[37:51.010 --> 37:57.010]  and then it will compete or not compete with the other crops that are out there.
[37:57.010 --> 37:59.010]  But I think it looks promising.
[37:59.010 --> 38:01.010]  That makes sense.
[38:01.010 --> 38:08.010]  I might add a quick comment, too, that I think this is an opportunity for growers across the state who want to diversify.
[38:08.010 --> 38:12.010]  It's just one more crop that would allow them to do that.
[38:12.010 --> 38:13.010]  Okay.
[38:13.010 --> 38:21.010]  This next question is where or how does the State of New York have competitive advantage compared to other states
[38:21.010 --> 38:32.800]  in terms of farm production and various manufacturing or product development opportunities?
[38:32.800 --> 38:33.800]  I'll jump in.
[38:33.800 --> 38:40.800]  I think the big obvious piece is what we've talked about in specialty crops for as long as I've been around New York State
[38:40.800 --> 38:45.800]  is the huge population that we have within a few hours of our upstate growing regions.
[38:45.800 --> 38:49.800]  I think that's where the opportunity lies.
[38:49.800 --> 38:59.800]  And I think in a sense the federal regulatory environment may not necessarily be helpful to us in this,
[38:59.800 --> 39:07.800]  but other states are going to have a hard time accessing that New York City market the way the federal regulatory environment is right now.
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.800]  That's a competitive advantage right there.
[39:09.800 --> 39:10.800]  Any other thoughts?
[39:10.800 --> 39:13.800]  I'll make a comment about production.
[39:13.800 --> 39:17.800]  Here in the Northeast we have water most years.
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.800]  We didn't last year, but most years we have water in contrast to many other states that, like in Colorado,
[39:23.800 --> 39:26.800]  they're going to have to irrigate in most cases there.
[39:26.800 --> 39:29.800]  So that's going to help in the economics of it.
[39:29.800 --> 39:33.800]  I would just add that in addition to the proximity to market,
[39:33.800 --> 39:39.800]  none of the other states around us have come even close to this level of organized support,
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.800]  especially at the state level.
[39:41.800 --> 39:51.800]  The announcements that were made earlier today are phenomenal to see this kind of thing happening with the governor's name on this endeavor.
[39:51.800 --> 40:00.800]  So, yeah, New York is not only well positioned, but we've got all of the gears in motion, which makes us very competitive indeed.
[40:00.800 --> 40:03.800]  I just have to jump in just because I have to here.
[40:03.800 --> 40:09.800]  But, you know, when it comes to production races in a crop, we'll always have challenges.
[40:09.800 --> 40:15.800]  There'll always be another part of the country or the world that will have a lower cost of production.
[40:15.800 --> 40:23.800]  But, again, to echo what our panelists have all said is that, you know, we live in the best kept secret in the country.
[40:23.800 --> 40:25.800]  We have generally water, access to water.
[40:25.800 --> 40:27.800]  We have good land.
[40:27.800 --> 40:32.800]  We have some of the best growers in the country.
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.800]  We have the best land grant system of education for agriculture in the country.
[40:37.800 --> 40:41.800]  And we live next door to the biggest, most amazing marketplace in the world.
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.800]  And that puts us at a distinct advantage for sure.
[40:46.800 --> 40:47.800]  Thank you.
[40:47.800 --> 40:54.800]  I think we have time for one last question before we will take a brief break before the next panel.
[40:54.800 --> 41:00.800]  So there are several questions that won't be addressed right now, but, again, thank you for writing your names and email addresses on them.
[41:00.800 --> 41:09.800]  This next question is also an agronomic question, and it is with regard to trials that are planned for research purposes.
[41:09.800 --> 41:14.800]  And the question is, will you be testing on mildly sloping sites, and if so,
[41:14.800 --> 41:20.800]  will you be gathering data about how effective hemp stands are at combating soil erosion on sloping grounds?
[41:20.800 --> 41:24.800]  A really good question.
[41:24.800 --> 41:31.800]  For our trials here at Cornell for the next season, they are not going to be on sloping land.
[41:31.800 --> 41:37.800]  But certainly as we expand across the state, there will be some sites, I'm sure, that are variable,
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.800]  some on flat land, some on slopes, various soil types and so forth.
[41:42.800 --> 41:45.800]  So, again, with the variability that we have across New York State,
[41:45.800 --> 41:51.800]  it really would behoove us to expand out and evaluate these varieties across various conditions.
[41:51.800 --> 41:53.800]  I can add to that.
[41:53.800 --> 41:59.800]  One of the sites that we're actually looking at at the Suny Sullivan campus is a pretty significantly sloped site.
[41:59.800 --> 42:04.800]  So we'd be very interested in working with your team to try to evaluate that.
[42:04.800 --> 42:07.800]  Our site last year was mildly sloped.
[42:07.800 --> 42:18.800]  I imagine in the 100-acre trial this year there will be some more steeply sloping sites, given where J.D. Farms is.
[42:18.800 --> 42:22.800]  I don't think there's a flat spot on the whole farm.
[42:22.800 --> 42:25.800]  But given how dry last year was, we didn't see any.
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.800]  But earlier this morning someone mentioned reseeding.
[42:29.800 --> 42:33.800]  Just through harvest, there's quite a lot of seed production.
[42:33.800 --> 42:36.800]  There was already regrowth in the field quickly afterwards.
[42:36.800 --> 42:41.800]  So not that you really want to lose seed, but in terms of erosion, it's reseeding itself,
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.800]  which would help maintain the soil where it is.
[42:46.800 --> 42:50.800]  Okay, please join me in giving this wonderful group a hand.
[42:50.800 --> 42:57.840]  This has been a production of Cornell University.
[42:57.840 --> 43:00.840]  On the web at cornell.edu.
