[00:00.000 --> 00:08.270]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:08.270 --> 00:10.070]  All right, come on in, folks.
[00:10.070 --> 00:11.270]  You can come closer to me.
[00:11.270 --> 00:12.890]  You're welcome to check out the plants.
[00:12.890 --> 00:15.430]  You're welcome to check out the soil as well.
[00:15.430 --> 00:16.190]  I'm going to start.
[00:18.750 --> 00:21.470]  So first I want to talk about what is a high tunnel.
[00:21.470 --> 00:24.030]  I don't think we haven't given that enough attention.
[00:24.030 --> 00:25.750]  A high tunnel is a greenhouse, but it's
[00:25.750 --> 00:28.870]  a greenhouse that sits on soil.
[00:28.870 --> 00:29.990]  Why would we do this?
[00:29.990 --> 00:33.670]  Why would we grow cannabis indoors?
[00:33.670 --> 00:35.150]  Well, inside of a high tunnel.
[00:35.150 --> 00:38.070]  So this is a marriage between field production
[00:38.070 --> 00:40.430]  and greenhouse production, fully automated greenhouse
[00:40.430 --> 00:41.150]  production.
[00:41.150 --> 00:42.710]  So what I'm going to share with you
[00:42.710 --> 00:45.790]  reflects off of some of what our economic speaker had
[00:45.790 --> 00:50.470]  this morning, John Hanschar, as well as our greenhouse speaker
[00:50.470 --> 00:53.470]  Neil Matson shared around fertility
[00:53.470 --> 00:54.870]  in a soil-less setting.
[00:54.870 --> 00:57.550]  This is a soil setting.
[00:57.550 --> 01:00.510]  So how about comments from the crowd?
[01:00.510 --> 01:04.190]  Why would I grow this inside in the soil?
[01:04.190 --> 01:06.110]  Any ideas?
[01:06.110 --> 01:06.790]  A lot easier?
[01:06.790 --> 01:08.830]  Easier than, say, hydroponics?
[01:12.470 --> 01:13.350]  It seems easier.
[01:13.350 --> 01:14.910]  That's the comment up front.
[01:14.910 --> 01:15.550]  Anything else?
[01:15.550 --> 01:16.950]  Why else would I grow this inside?
[01:16.950 --> 01:17.450]  Yeah?
[01:20.390 --> 01:23.470]  Light, and what was the first thing?
[01:23.470 --> 01:26.190]  Free sunlight, and so that's one of the biggest things.
[01:26.190 --> 01:29.590]  In agriculture, if we're going to spend money on any input,
[01:29.670 --> 01:32.670]  whether that's a tractor, a fertilizer injector,
[01:32.670 --> 01:35.430]  a bag of fertilizer, or a greenhouse,
[01:35.430 --> 01:39.750]  we have to ask ourselves, what does that input provide
[01:39.750 --> 01:42.190]  for us over field production?
[01:42.190 --> 01:45.310]  So high tunnel production provides a couple advantages
[01:45.310 --> 01:47.670]  over field production.
[01:47.670 --> 01:48.830]  One of those is earliness.
[01:48.830 --> 01:54.510]  So we can plant indoors a crop like hemp probably
[01:54.510 --> 01:57.870]  two to four weeks earlier than we would plant it outdoors.
[01:57.870 --> 02:00.070]  So something that's photosensitive, in other words,
[02:00.070 --> 02:04.590]  responds to the length of day, getting it in earlier,
[02:04.590 --> 02:08.510]  when in this part of the world our days are longer, earlier,
[02:08.510 --> 02:12.190]  we're going to probably have more branching and more foliar
[02:12.190 --> 02:13.350]  biomass.
[02:13.350 --> 02:15.710]  Our total yield is going to be higher.
[02:15.710 --> 02:17.630]  Any other reasons we grow inside?
[02:17.630 --> 02:19.510]  Keep the water off at the end of the year.
[02:19.510 --> 02:20.710]  Keep the water off.
[02:20.710 --> 02:22.070]  That's a great idea.
[02:22.070 --> 02:25.350]  So now I've got a rain cover, which is a good thing.
[02:25.350 --> 02:29.590]  Also has some challenges with it at harvest time.
[02:29.590 --> 02:33.150]  I could also probably skate through a frost or two
[02:33.150 --> 02:33.990]  in the fall.
[02:33.990 --> 02:36.990]  Maybe I can pick up two to four more weeks in the fall
[02:36.990 --> 02:39.110]  by growing indoors.
[02:39.110 --> 02:42.710]  Anything else come to mind?
[02:42.710 --> 02:45.270]  That issue of input cost, that's something
[02:45.270 --> 02:47.430]  I would really encourage you to think about in terms
[02:47.430 --> 02:49.350]  of the benefit you're getting from the crop
[02:49.350 --> 02:52.590]  relative to the investment that you're putting into it.
[02:52.590 --> 02:53.990]  Compare that to field production.
[02:53.990 --> 02:55.710]  Compare that to greenhouse production.
[02:55.710 --> 02:57.110]  Compare that to the grow dome that we're
[02:57.110 --> 02:58.510]  going to look at at one point.
[02:58.510 --> 03:00.190]  And then you can begin to make decisions
[03:00.190 --> 03:01.790]  on what you're going to do.
[03:01.790 --> 03:04.390]  Those are some of the benefits of growing inside.
[03:04.390 --> 03:06.150]  I think in all likelihood, we're probably
[03:06.150 --> 03:08.510]  going to increase our total cannabinoid production
[03:08.510 --> 03:12.950]  by growing indoors on a per space unit.
[03:12.950 --> 03:15.310]  Since we are excluding rain, we have
[03:15.310 --> 03:17.550]  to think about the condition of the soil.
[03:17.550 --> 03:20.670]  So if everyone looks at the soil,
[03:20.670 --> 03:21.710]  they've done a great job.
[03:21.710 --> 03:24.270]  Savannah's done a great job of almost getting rid
[03:24.270 --> 03:25.830]  of all our weeds in here.
[03:25.830 --> 03:28.870]  We've got this open space between plants.
[03:28.870 --> 03:31.270]  Can you folks see some white residue on the surface?
[03:34.510 --> 03:38.510]  You can reach down and pick some of that up.
[03:38.510 --> 03:41.350]  Any ideas on what this is?
[03:41.350 --> 03:42.670]  Lime, this is correct.
[03:42.670 --> 03:45.110]  Salt, that's also correct.
[03:45.110 --> 03:47.390]  So since we don't have any rain in here,
[03:47.390 --> 03:49.870]  we have no leaching, natural leaching of this soil
[03:49.910 --> 03:52.550]  with rain or snow over time.
[03:52.550 --> 03:55.550]  And certain inputs tend to build up over time.
[03:55.550 --> 03:56.550]  One of them is calcium.
[03:56.550 --> 03:59.310]  And if you remember from Neil's talk this morning,
[03:59.310 --> 04:03.070]  most groundwater in upstate New York is high in calcium.
[04:03.070 --> 04:05.190]  And it really is dissolved lime.
[04:05.190 --> 04:07.790]  So cannabis needs calcium.
[04:07.790 --> 04:09.230]  That's not a problem.
[04:09.230 --> 04:12.590]  But too much of a good thing is not a good thing.
[04:12.590 --> 04:16.110]  And so what we find is as these levels build up over time,
[04:16.110 --> 04:19.230]  other nutrients are restricted, particularly
[04:19.590 --> 04:23.110]  phosphorus and potassium inside of high tunnels.
[04:23.110 --> 04:26.670]  So managing a high tunnel soil, first and foremost,
[04:26.670 --> 04:29.470]  we've got to think about how are we going to address
[04:29.470 --> 04:34.230]  that issue of calcium in the soil, in the water.
[04:34.230 --> 04:35.310]  Any thoughts on that?
[04:36.870 --> 04:38.630]  Neil gave the answer this morning.
[04:41.350 --> 04:42.190]  Lower the pH.
[04:42.190 --> 04:43.230]  How do you lower that pH?
[04:45.990 --> 04:47.390]  Yep, sulfuric acid.
[04:47.390 --> 04:49.950]  If you're interested in a more organic approach,
[04:49.950 --> 04:53.710]  citric acid, which is a slightly weaker acid,
[04:53.710 --> 04:57.030]  is the acid of choice for organic production.
[04:57.030 --> 04:59.270]  While we're talking about organic production,
[05:00.790 --> 05:05.190]  you cannot grow hemp in a organic sense
[05:05.190 --> 05:06.830]  in a hydropodic setting.
[05:08.590 --> 05:12.070]  To be organic, your crops need to be in the soil.
[05:12.070 --> 05:14.030]  So this is one of the primary advantages of a high tunnel.
[05:14.030 --> 05:15.550]  It allows us to be organic,
[05:15.550 --> 05:17.390]  but we receive a lot of these benefits
[05:17.390 --> 05:19.030]  of the greenhouse structure.
[05:19.950 --> 05:22.190]  This high tunnel doesn't have any heat in it.
[05:23.270 --> 05:25.270]  We could put heat in here too if we wanted to
[05:25.270 --> 05:26.630]  and still call it a high tunnel.
[05:26.630 --> 05:28.150]  That'd be just fine.
[05:28.150 --> 05:31.810]  Okay, so we're gonna address calcium by adding some acid.
[05:32.670 --> 05:35.470]  We also wanna think about this soil
[05:35.470 --> 05:39.110]  as our primary bank of nutrients
[05:39.110 --> 05:42.830]  or how that is going to deliver nutrients to our crop.
[05:42.830 --> 05:45.270]  In the system that Neil showed this morning,
[05:45.950 --> 05:47.310]  we're able to pulse out nutrients
[05:47.310 --> 05:49.110]  in a parts per million manner
[05:49.110 --> 05:51.830]  to that hydroponic crop in a greenhouse.
[05:51.830 --> 05:54.630]  Beginning, maybe we're at 150 parts per million in
[05:54.630 --> 05:56.030]  and then we creep up to 200
[05:56.030 --> 06:00.150]  and then we back down to maybe 150, 100 ppm nitrogen.
[06:00.150 --> 06:03.550]  We can take that same approach here in a high tunnel.
[06:03.550 --> 06:05.550]  That's perfectly okay.
[06:05.550 --> 06:08.310]  The plant has the same needs.
[06:08.310 --> 06:09.430]  However, we have to look at
[06:09.430 --> 06:12.550]  what else are we putting in with that nitrogen?
[06:12.790 --> 06:15.550]  If that nitrogen is coming in an organic form,
[06:15.550 --> 06:17.070]  is there phosphorus with that?
[06:17.070 --> 06:18.310]  Is there potassium with that?
[06:18.310 --> 06:20.070]  Is there calcium with that?
[06:20.070 --> 06:22.910]  If I'm chasing nitrogen at a high level
[06:22.910 --> 06:25.750]  to get the biggest, bushiest plant I can,
[06:25.750 --> 06:28.550]  am I over applying those other nutrients?
[06:28.550 --> 06:30.830]  There's a very good chance you are.
[06:30.830 --> 06:31.750]  Growing in a high tunnel,
[06:31.750 --> 06:34.670]  the first thing you wanna do is test your soil.
[06:34.670 --> 06:35.510]  There's a number of labs
[06:35.510 --> 06:37.590]  that can help you with that soil test.
[06:37.590 --> 06:39.390]  Once I get that soil test back,
[06:39.390 --> 06:41.590]  I'm looking at nitrogen, phosphorus,
[06:41.630 --> 06:45.590]  potassium, magnesium, calcium, and our micronutrients.
[06:45.590 --> 06:47.630]  Then I can make adjustments to those.
[06:47.630 --> 06:51.670]  If I don't take those levels
[06:51.670 --> 06:53.310]  and I continue to fertilize this crop
[06:53.310 --> 06:54.710]  to get my maximum yield,
[06:54.710 --> 06:56.750]  I'm probably gonna over apply something.
[06:56.750 --> 06:59.030]  That's not a problem in year one.
[06:59.030 --> 07:01.230]  It's generally not a problem in year two.
[07:01.230 --> 07:04.590]  By year three, we have excess levels of certain nutrients
[07:04.590 --> 07:07.070]  like phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium
[07:07.070 --> 07:09.270]  that begin to restrict yield
[07:09.270 --> 07:12.630]  and we decrease the longevity of the high tunnel.
[07:12.630 --> 07:13.830]  We want a soil test.
[07:13.830 --> 07:15.710]  That's extremely important.
[07:15.710 --> 07:17.070]  Neil also shared this morning
[07:17.070 --> 07:20.110]  that there are labs now with sufficiency ranges
[07:20.110 --> 07:22.550]  for our foliar nutrients.
[07:22.550 --> 07:24.270]  After we've taken a soil test,
[07:24.270 --> 07:26.990]  we can now do foliar sampling throughout the season
[07:26.990 --> 07:28.230]  to make sure that we're staying
[07:28.230 --> 07:30.790]  within the sufficiency range for the plant.
[07:30.790 --> 07:33.350]  In other words, how good a job are we doing
[07:33.350 --> 07:35.870]  providing a fertilizer to this crop
[07:35.870 --> 07:38.270]  and how good a job is the plant doing to take it up?
[07:38.270 --> 07:40.750]  pH is, as noted earlier,
[07:40.750 --> 07:43.230]  is probably the most critical factor there.
[07:43.230 --> 07:46.870]  So testing, we test our soil, we test our plant.
[07:46.870 --> 07:48.310]  One more thing we need to test,
[07:48.310 --> 07:52.190]  and I'm not talking about the flowers, that's our water.
[07:52.190 --> 07:53.990]  We have to have a water test as well,
[07:53.990 --> 07:57.830]  primarily looking at pH and dissolved calcium
[07:57.830 --> 07:59.350]  or calcium bicarbonate.
[07:59.350 --> 08:01.310]  When I have those three tests,
[08:01.310 --> 08:04.870]  I can begin to formulate a fertilizer program.
[08:04.870 --> 08:07.750]  If I wanna do this in an organic fashion,
[08:07.750 --> 08:09.750]  I'm probably gonna front load that fertility.
[08:09.750 --> 08:12.710]  In other words, I'm gonna fit this soil in the spring
[08:12.710 --> 08:16.350]  and I'm going to apply those nutrients early on
[08:16.350 --> 08:19.710]  because I have less soluble nutrients available to me.
[08:19.710 --> 08:22.230]  If I'm gonna grow this with conventional fertilizers,
[08:22.230 --> 08:24.470]  I can spoon feed these crops
[08:24.470 --> 08:26.430]  just like they do in hydroponics
[08:26.430 --> 08:28.750]  with smaller doses throughout the season,
[08:28.750 --> 08:31.750]  injecting it through this drip line that you see right here.
[08:36.220 --> 08:39.020]  I'm gonna go to questions, comments, thoughts.
[08:39.020 --> 08:40.300]  Yeah, up front.
[08:40.300 --> 08:41.740]  Do you amend these beds at all
[08:41.740 --> 08:43.460]  with anything before you put it in?
[08:43.460 --> 08:45.620]  Do we amend these beds with anything at all
[08:45.620 --> 08:47.620]  before we put the crop in?
[08:47.620 --> 08:49.020]  We should.
[08:49.020 --> 08:50.780]  We take a soil test and we should amend
[08:50.780 --> 08:54.780]  based on any deficiencies we find in the soil ahead of time.
[08:54.780 --> 08:57.180]  I don't know if Savannah can hear me or is in...
[08:59.300 --> 09:02.020]  So I would ask Savannah if she did amend these or not.
[09:03.260 --> 09:04.660]  She's too far away.
[09:04.660 --> 09:05.500]  But I would, go ahead.
[09:05.500 --> 09:06.540]  Would you consider this a second one,
[09:06.540 --> 09:08.140]  would you consider this a living soil?
[09:08.140 --> 09:09.940]  Would I consider this a living soil?
[09:11.300 --> 09:12.820]  I consider most soil living.
[09:12.820 --> 09:14.540]  And so you're hitting on an important point here
[09:14.540 --> 09:17.820]  which is the microbial health of the soil.
[09:17.820 --> 09:19.700]  And again, a major difference
[09:19.700 --> 09:22.020]  between hydroponic production
[09:22.020 --> 09:24.940]  and high tunnel production is this soil.
[09:24.940 --> 09:27.140]  And the nutrients that we may apply there
[09:27.140 --> 09:31.060]  in a chemical sense depend on a microbial,
[09:31.060 --> 09:33.300]  really a whole ecosystem there
[09:33.300 --> 09:37.020]  to mediate that transfer of nutrients into the root system.
[09:37.020 --> 09:39.820]  So if it's not living, I'm basically in hydroponics
[09:39.820 --> 09:41.220]  even though I'm in the soil.
[09:41.220 --> 09:43.820]  Savannah, did you want to tell us what you amended with?
[09:43.820 --> 09:48.820]  Yeah, I believe it was 19.5 or four, 19.5 or four,
[09:49.820 --> 09:52.460]  or 19, I can't remember if it was 19.5 or four,
[09:52.460 --> 09:55.380]  but at 100 pounds of N per acre.
[09:55.380 --> 09:57.980]  And then you'll notice some of the plots like this plot
[09:57.980 --> 10:00.220]  have a bit of a white tinge to them.
[10:00.220 --> 10:02.060]  That's because we applied lozenge
[10:02.060 --> 10:05.180]  which is a silicon crystal to the soil
[10:05.180 --> 10:06.260]  to try to control the pattern.
[10:06.500 --> 10:09.300]  And I'll be talking more about why we did that later on.
[10:09.300 --> 10:11.940]  That's not calcium, that's one of your treatments.
[10:11.940 --> 10:13.940]  Okay, there's my timer.
[10:16.700 --> 10:19.860]  So one of the things we do in high tunnels
[10:19.860 --> 10:21.420]  to maintain that microbial life
[10:21.420 --> 10:22.620]  that was mentioned up here in the front
[10:22.620 --> 10:25.140]  is that we promote cover cropping in the wintertime.
[10:25.140 --> 10:27.100]  And I have a research program around that.
[10:27.100 --> 10:29.500]  So once these plants come out of here,
[10:29.500 --> 10:33.980]  we could sow a cover crop, a legume or a grain,
[10:33.980 --> 10:35.740]  allow that to grow in the cooler months
[10:35.740 --> 10:36.780]  and then incorporate that.
[10:36.780 --> 10:38.940]  And there in a sense we're feeding our microbes
[10:38.940 --> 10:41.940]  and ideally providing some long-term fertility to the crop.
[10:44.420 --> 10:47.100]  If you go to the OCM webpage,
[10:47.100 --> 10:51.100]  you'll notice that they strongly encourage cultivators
[10:51.100 --> 10:53.860]  to use organic practices.
[10:53.860 --> 10:55.620]  So if you're strongly encouraged by OCM
[10:55.620 --> 10:56.860]  to use organic practices,
[10:56.860 --> 10:59.180]  how are you gonna do that in a hydroponic setting?
[11:01.660 --> 11:03.140]  You don't have to answer me.
[11:03.140 --> 11:04.140]  Just think about it.
[11:06.100 --> 11:07.020]  Deep water culture.
[11:07.020 --> 11:08.420]  Deep water culture, okay.
[11:10.580 --> 11:13.140]  Any other comments or thoughts, questions?
[11:16.580 --> 11:18.420]  What are your handles?
[11:18.420 --> 11:19.460]  What are my handles?
[11:20.500 --> 11:21.900]  I see you at Influencer Judd.
[11:21.900 --> 11:23.980]  Oh yeah, I'm at Judd Reed.
[11:24.980 --> 11:27.180]  Judd Reed, J-U-D-R-E-I-D.
[11:28.580 --> 11:32.300]  I just tweeted out that Judd Reed is giving sage advice,
[11:32.300 --> 11:33.460]  you have to follow him.
[11:33.460 --> 11:34.300]  Thank you.
[11:34.500 --> 11:35.340]  Woo!
[11:35.340 --> 11:37.220]  That means I'm getting old if I'm sage.
[11:37.220 --> 11:38.060]  Damn right.
[11:38.060 --> 11:38.900]  Yeah.
[11:38.900 --> 11:40.820]  Now, yes, another comment here.
[11:40.820 --> 11:43.580]  Do you orientate these wind tunnels with the wind
[11:43.580 --> 11:45.260]  or across the screen?
[11:45.260 --> 11:46.460]  So these high tunnels,
[11:46.460 --> 11:48.420]  the question is about orientation
[11:48.420 --> 11:50.500]  and on a compass we're talking about here.
[11:50.500 --> 11:52.140]  What I would suggest is generally orienting
[11:52.140 --> 11:55.020]  on a north-south orientation.
[11:55.020 --> 11:57.500]  This crop is growing in a time of year where we want,
[11:57.500 --> 11:59.060]  the sun is pretty far north,
[11:59.060 --> 12:01.300]  as far north as it gets in New York.
[12:01.300 --> 12:03.780]  And if we are north-south,
[12:03.860 --> 12:06.340]  the sun's gonna go overhead and you have no fixed shadows.
[12:06.340 --> 12:08.180]  Each one of these overhead supports,
[12:08.180 --> 12:09.740]  if this was oriented east-west,
[12:09.740 --> 12:11.500]  in a sense becomes a fixed shadow
[12:11.500 --> 12:13.900]  if the sun is traveling directly overhead east-west.
[12:13.900 --> 12:16.660]  So north-south on a single bait like this.
[12:16.660 --> 12:17.700]  That's my suggestion.
[12:19.620 --> 12:21.060]  Do you ever move them?
[12:21.060 --> 12:22.140]  Do we ever move them?
[12:22.140 --> 12:24.060]  It seems like you can put wheels under them
[12:24.060 --> 12:26.940]  and rotate that way a little bit.
[12:26.940 --> 12:28.420]  Yeah, these things do get moved
[12:28.420 --> 12:31.580]  and there are versions with wheels.
[12:31.580 --> 12:34.500]  There's a manufacturer called RIMOL, R-I-M-O-L,
[12:34.500 --> 12:37.100]  that will sell you those.
[12:38.020 --> 12:39.820]  My experience is, so if we move them,
[12:39.820 --> 12:43.660]  you get away from the soil problems that I'm talking about.
[12:43.660 --> 12:46.140]  Those models do tend to move,
[12:46.140 --> 12:48.820]  sometimes in directions we don't want them to go.
[12:48.820 --> 12:51.060]  They're a little bit less fixed to the ground.
[12:51.060 --> 12:53.740]  But if you do move it, you can maintain soil health easier.
[12:53.740 --> 12:55.340]  Move it every couple years.
[12:55.340 --> 12:56.860]  Yes, in the back.
[12:58.580 --> 13:00.620]  There's a gentleman behind you and then you.
[13:00.620 --> 13:01.460]  Yep.
[13:11.350 --> 13:12.830]  Absolutely, yeah.
[13:19.840 --> 13:22.240]  Yeah, so a comment on removing the plastic.
[13:22.240 --> 13:24.280]  Removing the plastic does allow
[13:24.280 --> 13:25.960]  a winter's worth of precipitation to come in.
[13:25.960 --> 13:26.800]  That's great.
[13:26.800 --> 13:29.040]  It's very hard on the plastic to do that.
[13:29.040 --> 13:31.320]  Most greenhouse plastic really comes
[13:31.320 --> 13:34.000]  with a three-year usable life.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.360]  Now, if you're farmers, when I say three,
[13:37.360 --> 13:39.160]  you're hearing four and some of you
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.120]  are hearing the word five.
[13:41.120 --> 13:44.640]  What I would suggest is, at the end of those three years,
[13:44.640 --> 13:46.320]  that's the time to remove the plastic
[13:46.320 --> 13:48.440]  and give it that full season of leaching.
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.040]  The second question was, or comment was about compost.
[13:52.040 --> 13:54.200]  Compost does a couple of things for us.
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.320]  It is an organic source of nutrients.
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.360]  And beyond nutrients, it also provides
[14:00.360 --> 14:02.240]  some carbon for soil life.
[14:02.240 --> 14:05.680]  And it provides physical structure to the soil as well.
[14:05.680 --> 14:08.560]  Most compost does not have a balanced set of nutrients
[14:08.600 --> 14:09.800]  in terms of what we're looking for.
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.320]  So if someone is gonna use compost
[14:12.320 --> 14:16.080]  as their source of nitrogen, their sole source of nitrogen,
[14:16.080 --> 14:18.520]  they're gonna grossly over-apply other nutrients.
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.960]  And you get away with it for a year or two,
[14:19.960 --> 14:21.960]  but not much beyond that.
[14:21.960 --> 14:23.560]  Yes, there was a, go ahead.
[14:23.560 --> 14:25.560]  Yes, do you know what the PSI is in here
[14:25.560 --> 14:28.120]  or how long or how often you're gonna apply?
[14:28.120 --> 14:29.960]  The PSI in the drip line.
[14:29.960 --> 14:31.960]  Savannah, you wanna do that or you want me to do it?
[14:31.960 --> 14:32.800]  Good.
[14:34.400 --> 14:38.200]  I believe we have a pressure system that's at 10 PSI.
[14:38.840 --> 14:41.240]  And we had to do a lot of fiddling around
[14:41.240 --> 14:42.840]  with the irrigation system in here
[14:42.840 --> 14:44.120]  just so we weren't over-watering.
[14:44.120 --> 14:46.680]  And I'll talk a bit more about that later on today.
[14:46.680 --> 14:50.240]  But we irrigate this for 15 minutes, three times a day
[14:50.240 --> 14:52.200]  at this point, every eight hours.
[14:52.200 --> 14:54.200]  And that's seeming to work well for us.
[14:55.480 --> 14:58.440]  John, can we go back to the compost question?
[14:58.440 --> 14:59.640]  Yes, compost question.
[14:59.640 --> 15:02.720]  I've seen a lot of growers make their own compost
[15:02.720 --> 15:06.400]  using a lot of wood chips and heavy carbon materials.
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.240]  Yep.
[15:08.200 --> 15:10.120]  Can you talk about some of the disadvantages of that?
[15:10.120 --> 15:12.800]  Yeah, so Janice has a question in regards to compost
[15:12.800 --> 15:16.280]  that might have a lot of wood chips in it.
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.960]  Those wood chips are basically carbon
[15:18.960 --> 15:21.160]  and it's great to get carbon into the soil.
[15:21.160 --> 15:22.960]  Once that carbon goes into the soil,
[15:22.960 --> 15:26.520]  the microbes that are there generally wanna break that down.
[15:26.520 --> 15:29.240]  When they do that, they're gonna compete with our plants,
[15:29.240 --> 15:30.640]  particularly for nitrogen.
[15:30.640 --> 15:32.800]  So over-applying woody compost
[15:32.800 --> 15:35.720]  can lead to a nitrogen deficiency in your crop.
[15:35.720 --> 15:37.320]  That's the short answer on that.
[15:38.680 --> 15:39.520]  Yes.
[15:39.520 --> 15:41.600]  Back to the watering thing.
[15:41.600 --> 15:43.600]  You said three times a day for 15 minutes.
[15:43.600 --> 15:46.080]  I know some plants benefit more
[15:46.080 --> 15:50.200]  from kind of drying right out, heavy watering.
[15:50.200 --> 15:53.200]  Is that true with hemp or do they prefer
[15:53.200 --> 15:55.880]  smaller or dispersed water?
[15:56.800 --> 15:57.800]  Do you wanna do that, Savannah?
[15:57.800 --> 15:59.440]  You want me to do it?
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.040]  Yeah.
[16:01.040 --> 16:02.200]  Still working it out.
[16:02.200 --> 16:04.560]  I actually would disagree with their approach
[16:04.560 --> 16:09.200]  of going every 15 minutes in three times a day.
[16:09.200 --> 16:11.680]  Plants don't need water at night.
[16:11.680 --> 16:13.720]  Plants need water most
[16:13.720 --> 16:15.200]  when they're under photosynthetic stress.
[16:15.200 --> 16:17.200]  So in other words, what is their peak workload
[16:17.200 --> 16:18.520]  during the day?
[16:18.520 --> 16:20.400]  That's about one o'clock in the afternoon.
[16:20.400 --> 16:23.800]  So for me, I would approach a more thorough watering,
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.160]  probably mid-morning, with the following rationale.
[16:27.160 --> 16:29.440]  If I can apply water to a greater depth
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.000]  of this soil profile, I'm gonna promote deeper rooting.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.040]  If that plant roots deeper, it's more likely
[16:35.040 --> 16:37.840]  to access some of those hard-to-get micronutrients
[16:37.840 --> 16:40.760]  and other macronutrients that I might be struggling to get.
[16:40.760 --> 16:41.600]  That's me.
[16:41.600 --> 16:43.400]  I don't have a lot of science behind that.
[16:43.400 --> 16:44.480]  That's just my experience.
[16:44.480 --> 16:45.320]  Yes?
[16:45.320 --> 16:47.000]  I was wondering the same thing about the watering.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.400]  Watering at night, does that promote powdery mildew?
[16:49.400 --> 16:52.000]  Does watering at night promote powdery mildew?
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.680]  I don't know, but there's no good reason
[16:55.680 --> 16:57.280]  to water at night, I'll say that.
[16:57.280 --> 16:58.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:58.120 --> 16:58.960]  You want me to answer that?
[16:58.960 --> 16:59.800]  Yeah, please do.
[16:59.800 --> 17:01.080]  Chris, smart.
[17:03.880 --> 17:07.640]  So powdery mildew, unlike all other diseases,
[17:07.640 --> 17:10.560]  likes dry leaves, but high humidity.
[17:10.560 --> 17:13.520]  So if you water at night, you're gonna bump up
[17:13.520 --> 17:15.880]  the humidity when the air is cooler,
[17:15.880 --> 17:19.440]  and it can absolutely promote powdery mildew.
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.400]  But I agree, there's no good reason to water at night.
[17:22.400 --> 17:25.640]  Well, it's almost 12 o'clock.
[17:25.640 --> 17:26.760]  Some of you may be hungry.
[17:26.760 --> 17:28.080]  I'm hungry.
[17:28.080 --> 17:31.000]  There was a question about my handles on social media.
[17:31.840 --> 17:34.720]  It's Judd Reed, J-U-D-R-E-I-D.
[17:35.840 --> 17:38.240]  Are you in front of a little yellow tree?
[17:38.240 --> 17:39.080]  Yellow tree.
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.120]  Yellow tree, that's not me.
[17:40.120 --> 17:41.280]  That's the other Judd Reed.
[17:41.280 --> 17:43.800]  There's a guy, he's like in a rock and roll band.
[17:43.800 --> 17:44.640]  That's not me.
[17:46.520 --> 17:49.120]  I have professional accounts on Facebook and Twitter.
[17:49.120 --> 17:53.240]  My Instagram is like pure rainbows, kittens, and sailboats.
[17:53.240 --> 17:54.280]  You're welcome to follow me there.
[17:54.280 --> 17:55.520]  That's my personal page.
[17:56.600 --> 17:58.160]  I think we should wrap this up.
[17:58.200 --> 18:00.960]  Is there an organizer present
[18:00.960 --> 18:03.280]  that's gonna direct us to where we're going?
[18:03.280 --> 18:05.720]  We're going back where we were for that,
[18:05.720 --> 18:08.000]  the first two hours of the day, George Hall.
[18:08.000 --> 18:09.040]  Yeah, Daniela.
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.600]  Yeah, I'll walk people over.
[18:10.600 --> 18:12.000]  Daniela's gonna walk people over.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.920]  She's in a red shirt and the amazing pants
[18:18.040 --> 18:19.720]  with the panthers on.
[18:19.720 --> 18:22.760]  And also, she is our emerging crop specialist.
[18:23.760 --> 18:24.920]  Come inside, Daniela.
[18:25.880 --> 18:26.720]  Woo!
[18:30.710 --> 18:32.630]  La magnifica, la unica.
[18:32.630 --> 18:34.110]  La unica.
[18:34.110 --> 18:34.950]  Daniela Vergara.
[18:34.950 --> 18:37.950]  Daniela is our emerging crop specialist,
[18:37.950 --> 18:41.710]  and she's really taken the lead on hemp production
[18:41.710 --> 18:44.310]  in New York State in terms of being an on-farm presence
[18:44.310 --> 18:47.270]  and helping to move the industry forward.
[18:47.270 --> 18:48.110]  Thank her.
[18:48.110 --> 18:49.150]  She put a lot of work into this today
[18:49.150 --> 18:52.510]  in addition to Larry Smart's lab and other people.
[18:52.510 --> 18:54.510]  And she would love to learn about what you're growing
[18:54.510 --> 18:56.230]  and how you're growing it and where you're growing it.
[18:56.270 --> 18:57.430]  Please chat with Daniela.
[18:57.430 --> 18:58.270]  Woo!
[18:58.270 --> 18:59.110]  Woo!
[18:59.110 --> 18:59.950]  Woo!
[18:59.950 --> 19:01.430]  And she actually is an influencer.
[19:01.430 --> 19:03.270]  She actually has a good Twitter handle.
[19:03.270 --> 19:04.390]  Ha ha ha.
[19:04.390 --> 19:07.750]  Kana Verkana on Twitter, and she's got a good Twitter page.
[19:07.750 --> 19:08.590]  Thank you.
[19:08.590 --> 19:09.510]  Have a good day.
[19:09.510 --> 19:10.510]  Thank you.
[19:10.510 --> 19:11.350]  Let's eat lunch.
[19:11.350 --> 19:12.190]  Woo!
[19:15.050 --> 19:18.530]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[19:18.530 --> 19:21.370]  on the web at cornell.edu.
