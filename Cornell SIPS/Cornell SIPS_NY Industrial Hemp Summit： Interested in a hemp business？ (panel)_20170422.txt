[00:00.000 --> 00:10.850]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:10.850 --> 00:14.330]  Thank you so much for coming back.
[00:14.330 --> 00:15.450]  We're going to keep going.
[00:15.450 --> 00:18.530]  We have another panel discussion upon us.
[00:18.530 --> 00:22.570]  This one is kind of broad and entitled,
[00:22.570 --> 00:23.930]  Interested in a Hemp Business?
[00:23.930 --> 00:26.610]  Question mark.
[00:26.610 --> 00:28.450]  This panel is going to look at some factors
[00:28.450 --> 00:31.170]  to consider before entering the hemp field
[00:31.170 --> 00:34.770]  and the building blocks of a successful research project
[00:34.810 --> 00:37.170]  and building a future business around hemp.
[00:37.170 --> 00:40.050]  So kind of broad, but a little more focused, perhaps,
[00:40.050 --> 00:41.930]  on the next steps.
[00:41.930 --> 00:44.690]  As a reminder, again, in this session,
[00:44.690 --> 00:47.850]  we'll hear from each one of our panelists for a few minutes.
[00:47.850 --> 00:49.690]  And then if you are thinking of a question
[00:49.690 --> 00:53.970]  now or during their comments, write that down on that card,
[00:53.970 --> 00:57.570]  hold it up, and we will retrieve them and answer
[00:57.570 --> 01:01.290]  those questions when we get to the end of our session.
[01:01.290 --> 01:05.490]  So without any further ado, our first panelist,
[01:05.490 --> 01:08.290]  Susie Cody from the Hemp Industries Association.
[01:08.290 --> 01:09.290]  Please welcome Susie.
[01:09.290 --> 01:14.410]  Thank you.
[01:14.410 --> 01:18.530]  Thank you for this opportunity and for inviting me.
[01:18.530 --> 01:22.690]  I represent the advocates that are around New York State.
[01:22.690 --> 01:26.410]  And we've been working really hard for the last several years
[01:26.410 --> 01:28.850]  to get the word out about hemp.
[01:28.850 --> 01:32.530]  And it's my observation that right now, what's
[01:32.530 --> 01:35.090]  happening, three pretty interesting things
[01:35.090 --> 01:38.690]  in our culture and our society right now,
[01:38.690 --> 01:44.170]  our advancement in technology, our current social awareness
[01:44.170 --> 01:48.850]  and the access that we have to communication with each other,
[01:48.850 --> 01:52.610]  and also the current challenges that we are all, as humans,
[01:52.610 --> 01:57.130]  facing and having in common, climate problems,
[01:57.130 --> 01:58.930]  environmental problems.
[01:58.930 --> 02:01.490]  And I think that what we're doing or what we're seeing
[02:01.490 --> 02:05.330]  is hemp is coming in and it could be a solution
[02:05.330 --> 02:11.170]  to these problems and use these to its advantage.
[02:11.170 --> 02:14.210]  Seeing things like the possibility
[02:14.210 --> 02:17.850]  of replacing petroleum with hemp,
[02:17.850 --> 02:21.890]  fixing our contaminated soils and industrial waste,
[02:21.890 --> 02:23.370]  these are large scale problems.
[02:23.370 --> 02:25.690]  And knowing that we can grow hemp
[02:25.690 --> 02:30.450]  in a large scale industrial way is a huge advantage to us
[02:30.450 --> 02:32.730]  right now.
[02:32.730 --> 02:36.210]  And what's really exciting to be finding out today
[02:36.210 --> 02:40.730]  is how much the state and the politicians are behind hemp.
[02:40.730 --> 02:43.450]  So we can see nothing but moving forward
[02:43.450 --> 02:45.170]  at this point, which is really exciting.
[02:45.170 --> 02:47.490]  This is what we've been working for for so many years.
[02:48.490 --> 02:51.930]  So basically, what are the marketing opportunities
[02:51.930 --> 02:53.610]  that come out of this?
[02:53.610 --> 02:56.130]  There's, like it's been mentioned here before,
[02:56.130 --> 03:00.010]  25,000 plus uses of hemp.
[03:00.010 --> 03:02.930]  What I think New York could take advantage of
[03:02.930 --> 03:08.290]  is growing hemp for the fiber and the herd.
[03:08.290 --> 03:11.250]  A lot of different, like Canada and other countries
[03:11.250 --> 03:15.490]  are really getting into the oil and the oil
[03:15.530 --> 03:20.450]  and growing it for grain, which is definitely a market.
[03:20.450 --> 03:24.090]  We could corner the market on fiber.
[03:24.090 --> 03:26.770]  And as we're learning and researching
[03:26.770 --> 03:29.450]  how to grow the quality fiber, we
[03:29.450 --> 03:33.050]  could be using it instead of seeing it as a waste product
[03:33.050 --> 03:36.450]  where some places they have to either get rid of it
[03:36.450 --> 03:39.290]  or they're not properly processing it.
[03:39.290 --> 03:41.810]  It could be used for like animal bedding.
[03:41.810 --> 03:44.730]  And I don't know how many of you are aware,
[03:44.770 --> 03:46.970]  but it could be used for building houses.
[03:46.970 --> 03:48.890]  If it's processed in the right way
[03:48.890 --> 03:51.930]  and combined with lime and water,
[03:51.930 --> 03:56.250]  we can actually build houses out of it and other structures.
[03:56.250 --> 03:59.370]  It's got many qualities to it that
[03:59.370 --> 04:02.090]  are desirable in this area.
[04:02.090 --> 04:04.050]  Especially, it's got a high R value,
[04:04.050 --> 04:07.810]  and it's mold resistant and rodent resistant,
[04:07.810 --> 04:09.050]  fire resistant.
[04:09.050 --> 04:10.490]  And so that's definitely one thing
[04:10.490 --> 04:15.970]  to start looking into as far as marketing.
[04:15.970 --> 04:20.330]  Our biofuels, people could start creating co-ops.
[04:20.330 --> 04:24.170]  I've seen it happen in Vermont and Kentucky,
[04:24.170 --> 04:28.130]  farmers getting together and pooling their resources
[04:28.130 --> 04:33.210]  and creating their own biofuels for their tractors.
[04:33.210 --> 04:36.650]  There's also a lot of niche markets that could be created.
[04:36.650 --> 04:39.130]  You could start growing and having
[04:39.130 --> 04:41.090]  the production happen on a smaller scale
[04:41.090 --> 04:43.290]  while we're waiting for the industry
[04:43.290 --> 04:45.370]  to create a large scale production.
[04:45.370 --> 04:50.170]  So one place in Kentucky, I know they're growing hemp
[04:50.170 --> 04:54.050]  and they're partnering with some animal growers.
[04:54.050 --> 04:57.250]  And they're combining the fiber and making American flags out
[04:57.250 --> 04:57.730]  of it.
[04:57.730 --> 05:00.530]  So there are really some unique and creative ideas
[05:00.530 --> 05:06.490]  that people could start to cash in on.
[05:06.490 --> 05:08.730]  One of the things, though, is that we have to really
[05:08.730 --> 05:11.450]  consider, and hopefully that will be researched here
[05:11.450 --> 05:14.810]  in New York, is the demand for it.
[05:14.810 --> 05:17.730]  We really need to ensure that if we're
[05:17.730 --> 05:20.850]  going to put all this energy behind growing it and creating
[05:20.850 --> 05:22.970]  it, who's going to buy it?
[05:22.970 --> 05:24.050]  Who's going to use it?
[05:24.050 --> 05:26.930]  Who's going to put the money up to retrofit their factories
[05:26.930 --> 05:33.770]  to stop creating paper from wood and start to use hemp?
[05:33.770 --> 05:39.490]  All these things are going to need a switch over in equipment.
[05:39.490 --> 05:41.450]  I haven't done a lot of research about that.
[05:41.450 --> 05:44.890]  But I know that there are certain things that
[05:44.890 --> 05:47.410]  are going to have to be changed in order to enable hemp
[05:47.410 --> 05:53.570]  to come in and really enable that process.
[05:53.570 --> 05:56.930]  Another thing that's really important is to educate
[05:56.930 --> 06:03.450]  our farmers and enable them to have a fair shot to let this
[06:03.450 --> 06:07.170]  be something that they can bring into their rotation
[06:07.170 --> 06:11.130]  and work with them, share this information,
[06:11.130 --> 06:15.290]  allow them to use their expertise.
[06:15.290 --> 06:16.250]  They know their land.
[06:16.250 --> 06:19.370]  They know how to grow crops.
[06:19.370 --> 06:23.090]  And everybody works together with this information.
[06:23.090 --> 06:28.530]  And we just are able to create stronger varieties, more
[06:28.530 --> 06:32.370]  desirable varieties, and really open up industry
[06:32.370 --> 06:36.610]  to come into this state and grow from within as well.
[06:36.610 --> 06:38.210]  We have a lot of companies already
[06:38.210 --> 06:42.410]  that are looking to use hemp for their products.
[06:42.410 --> 06:44.490]  And it would be excellent if we could
[06:44.490 --> 06:47.970]  be supplying them for that.
[06:47.970 --> 06:53.330]  So basically, I just want to encourage education, really,
[06:53.330 --> 06:54.250]  is what we need to do.
[06:54.250 --> 06:58.050]  And it would be great if there was some funding that
[06:58.050 --> 07:01.490]  went along for that, because that's really essentially
[07:01.570 --> 07:03.450]  going to grow our markets and the demand.
[07:06.010 --> 07:07.370]  Thank you very much, Susie.
[07:07.370 --> 07:13.640]  Let's give her a round of applause.
[07:13.640 --> 07:17.360]  And next panelist to discuss textiles and packaging,
[07:17.360 --> 07:20.360]  right here from Cornell's College of Human Ecology,
[07:20.360 --> 07:22.240]  Dr. Anil Netravali.
[07:22.240 --> 07:23.160]  Thank you very much.
[07:23.160 --> 07:24.360]  Thank you.
[07:24.360 --> 07:28.640]  Being a faculty member for the last 30 years,
[07:28.640 --> 07:31.640]  I like to stand and deliver.
[07:31.640 --> 07:32.720]  All right.
[07:32.720 --> 07:34.600]  So I have a PowerPoint, and I didn't
[07:34.600 --> 07:38.840]  want to also put my laser beam onto these guys.
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.120]  So I'm going to be standing up.
[07:40.120 --> 07:42.500]  Anyway, I'm in the Department of Fiber Science and Apparel
[07:42.500 --> 07:43.280]  Design.
[07:43.280 --> 07:47.200]  And we look at all the varieties of fibers,
[07:47.200 --> 07:50.160]  natural or synthetic, and their applications
[07:50.160 --> 07:55.760]  in a wide variety of products.
[07:55.760 --> 08:00.320]  So today, and we work with both natural fibers
[08:00.320 --> 08:02.360]  and synthetic fibers, as I mentioned.
[08:02.960 --> 08:07.040]  My recent work has been more in the natural fibers
[08:07.040 --> 08:08.600]  than the synthetic fibers, although I
[08:08.600 --> 08:10.400]  have done work in this thing.
[08:10.400 --> 08:14.680]  So there are some of the fibers that we have used in the past.
[08:14.680 --> 08:18.080]  And of course, hemp is one of them.
[08:18.080 --> 08:20.040]  But we had to import hemp.
[08:20.040 --> 08:21.920]  And now I'm so happy to see that hemp
[08:21.920 --> 08:24.800]  will be grown in my own state.
[08:24.800 --> 08:26.080]  That would be wonderful.
[08:26.080 --> 08:29.560]  Now, there are lots of other fibers as well.
[08:29.560 --> 08:33.480]  But hemp has certain advantages.
[08:33.480 --> 08:36.280]  Just a little bit of facts.
[08:36.280 --> 08:39.520]  Hemp is among the oldest industries on Earth,
[08:39.520 --> 08:42.680]  going back to 10,000 years.
[08:42.680 --> 08:47.480]  In Chinese museums, they have a wrapping paper-like material
[08:47.480 --> 08:51.000]  that's more than 2,000 years old.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.160]  President Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.440]  So we have some company there.
[09:00.320 --> 09:01.520]  Hemp fiber is longer.
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.760]  Of course, it comes from the stem or the bast of the plant.
[09:05.760 --> 09:08.720]  It's stronger than cotton.
[09:08.720 --> 09:12.040]  It's more absorbent than cotton.
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.400]  It's more insulative than cotton.
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.880]  So there are lots of advantages compared to cotton
[09:18.880 --> 09:20.800]  in using hemp.
[09:20.800 --> 09:23.320]  Hemp grows well without herbicides.
[09:23.320 --> 09:25.840]  We did hear about the herbicides, fungicides,
[09:25.840 --> 09:27.320]  and pesticides.
[09:27.360 --> 09:29.920]  But it can grow without all these,
[09:29.920 --> 09:33.600]  compared to any of the cotton varieties.
[09:33.600 --> 09:38.800]  It's basically much more eco-friendly than cotton is.
[09:38.800 --> 09:41.520]  And here's the hemp plant.
[09:41.520 --> 09:44.120]  OK, I don't see that.
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.920]  This is the cross-section of the hemp plant.
[09:46.920 --> 09:50.240]  And the bast, that is the skin of the plant,
[09:50.240 --> 09:52.400]  where from which you can derive the fibers.
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.160]  When they are first derived, you can have them coarser,
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.600]  but you can, what is called cottonizing it,
[10:01.600 --> 10:04.840]  make it into much finer fibers.
[10:04.840 --> 10:09.640]  So if you take a look at the coarser hemp fibers,
[10:09.640 --> 10:13.080]  they could be used very easily for bags for packaging,
[10:13.080 --> 10:16.880]  carpets for primary backing or the secondary backing,
[10:16.880 --> 10:21.880]  and ropes because hemp is much stronger than cotton.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.200]  Cotton is also longer, so it's easier to spin it
[10:26.200 --> 10:27.520]  into a rope.
[10:27.520 --> 10:31.240]  And we have a great example of use of rope, hemp ropes.
[10:31.240 --> 10:34.680]  U.S. Constitution, more than 200 years ago,
[10:34.680 --> 10:38.440]  all the ropes here were hemp ropes.
[10:39.800 --> 10:42.840]  Then of course, once it is made into finer variety
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.800]  or cottonized, we can have a lot of fabrics
[10:47.800 --> 10:50.720]  or yarns or apparel, all varieties.
[10:52.280 --> 10:53.400]  There are actually outside,
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.600]  there are lots of nice clothing available.
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.600]  We, in fact, downtown, we had a hemp store a few years ago.
[11:01.760 --> 11:04.120]  I don't know what happened to it.
[11:04.120 --> 11:06.760]  But anyway, we can do a lot of things.
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.440]  Let me just mention about what I have been doing
[11:11.520 --> 11:13.800]  in the research.
[11:13.800 --> 11:17.880]  My research is fiber reinforced composites.
[11:17.880 --> 11:20.200]  And in composite materials, for example,
[11:20.200 --> 11:22.520]  if you play tennis, the racket is made out
[11:22.520 --> 11:25.600]  of a composite material, epoxy and graphite fibers.
[11:25.600 --> 11:29.000]  If you fly in the Boeing Dreamliner,
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.720]  60% of the structure is made out of composite materials,
[11:32.720 --> 11:34.400]  graphite and epoxy.
[11:34.400 --> 11:36.280]  But for many applications,
[11:36.280 --> 11:39.200]  we really don't need graphite or epoxy.
[11:39.200 --> 11:42.240]  In 1930s, this is Henry Ford,
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.560]  who made the first composite using natural fibers,
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.520]  hemp fibers and soy protein based resin.
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.960]  And he was testing it with his hammer here in this picture.
[11:54.960 --> 11:56.000]  All right.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.760]  But anyway, petroleum became cheaper
[11:57.760 --> 12:00.120]  and then things changed.
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.600]  So in our lab, we do use natural fibers.
[12:03.600 --> 12:06.440]  In this case, we use soy protein,
[12:06.440 --> 12:09.840]  modify it chemically and make it into a resin
[12:09.840 --> 12:13.880]  and add to that fibers, which are very strong,
[12:13.880 --> 12:15.380]  hemp or other fibers.
[12:15.380 --> 12:17.060]  We have used a variety of them
[12:17.060 --> 12:19.140]  and then make it into a composite.
[12:19.140 --> 12:22.860]  We can use the fibers in fiber form
[12:22.860 --> 12:25.340]  or woven form or knitted form,
[12:25.340 --> 12:28.340]  depending upon what is needed in the composite materials.
[12:28.340 --> 12:30.660]  And we can make the composites.
[12:30.660 --> 12:33.300]  I have actually a few samples here.
[12:34.260 --> 12:35.740]  Perhaps I can pass those.
[12:35.740 --> 12:39.100]  These are made out of jute fibers
[12:39.100 --> 12:44.100]  and 50% jute fibers and 50% soy protein based resin.
[12:45.940 --> 12:50.060]  And this is, there's no VOCs, no nothing.
[12:50.060 --> 12:52.740]  And if you are really hungry, you can eat them.
[12:52.740 --> 12:55.860]  The only one condition, you got to have good teeth.
[12:55.860 --> 12:56.700]  Okay.
[12:56.700 --> 12:58.740]  So I'll pass these along.
[12:58.740 --> 12:59.940]  You can pass these.
[13:02.700 --> 13:05.260]  So Cornell has been very nice to me.
[13:05.260 --> 13:09.180]  And what they did was when we built the Savage Hall,
[13:09.180 --> 13:12.140]  the fourth floor on the Savage Hall,
[13:12.140 --> 13:15.660]  all the cabinetry and shelvings and everything
[13:15.660 --> 13:17.940]  were made out of these materials.
[13:17.940 --> 13:19.920]  That's an example of that.
[13:19.920 --> 13:22.420]  So, and it's been like four or five years
[13:22.420 --> 13:24.700]  and perfectly fine.
[13:26.340 --> 13:30.020]  Of course, Susie mentioned about the housing
[13:30.020 --> 13:31.580]  and all these things.
[13:31.580 --> 13:33.980]  There is a company which makes hempcrete
[13:33.980 --> 13:36.980]  and that's a house built in North Carolina,
[13:36.980 --> 13:40.940]  incredible fabric house made out of hemp fabric,
[13:40.940 --> 13:43.700]  insulation on everything that you need for housing
[13:43.700 --> 13:45.700]  can be made using hemp.
[13:45.700 --> 13:48.380]  And I'm not going to take much of your time.
[13:48.380 --> 13:52.100]  So I'll wait for your questions if you have any later.
[13:52.100 --> 13:53.620]  Thank you very much.
[13:53.620 --> 13:54.460]  Thank you, doctor.
[13:54.460 --> 14:02.330]  And now to our partners from this morning,
[14:02.330 --> 14:04.730]  actually attracting investors,
[14:04.730 --> 14:07.530]  Dan Dalgen and Mark Just from JD Farms.
[14:07.530 --> 14:08.350]  Great.
[14:08.350 --> 14:09.190]  Well, thank you very much.
[14:09.190 --> 14:10.030]  And it's great to be here.
[14:10.030 --> 14:12.410]  And it's truly, I would tell you,
[14:12.930 --> 14:15.370]  it's amazing to see when government and academia
[14:15.370 --> 14:16.850]  and the private sector can work together.
[14:16.850 --> 14:18.290]  I think great things are happening
[14:18.290 --> 14:19.590]  and will continue to happen.
[14:19.590 --> 14:21.270]  So thank you on behalf of our farm
[14:21.270 --> 14:24.290]  for all the work that's been done in Albany
[14:24.290 --> 14:27.890]  and in Binghamton, the Summit of Juan Lopardo.
[14:27.890 --> 14:30.110]  So why did we get into this?
[14:30.110 --> 14:32.210]  And is there a market out there that can be addressed?
[14:32.210 --> 14:35.770]  And I think one of the things that struck Dan and I
[14:35.770 --> 14:38.290]  about hemp was that you can walk to a Wegmans,
[14:38.290 --> 14:39.970]  you can walk to a Whole Foods,
[14:39.970 --> 14:42.250]  you can go to any place in Brooklyn and you can buy seeds,
[14:43.090 --> 14:44.050]  you can have it on your yogurt,
[14:44.050 --> 14:46.610]  you can have it in cereal, you can have it in your granola,
[14:46.610 --> 14:48.550]  but you couldn't grow it in the US.
[14:48.550 --> 14:51.130]  And that to us, we found that incredibly interesting.
[14:51.130 --> 14:53.910]  And we started doing a lot of research on why that is.
[14:53.910 --> 14:56.410]  And so we think there is a great market in hemp
[14:56.410 --> 14:57.730]  and it's slowly evolving.
[14:57.730 --> 15:00.290]  What are some of the things that we like about hemp?
[15:00.290 --> 15:01.890]  And we think it's interesting for investors
[15:01.890 --> 15:03.530]  to take a look at hemp over time.
[15:03.530 --> 15:04.890]  Well, one is it's been stated,
[15:04.890 --> 15:09.890]  it's over $600 million market in the US right now.
[15:09.930 --> 15:12.170]  Very little hemp is grown in the US.
[15:12.170 --> 15:15.090]  Eric Steenshrew is here, you can vote hemp,
[15:15.090 --> 15:18.130]  and you can really look at some of the statistics.
[15:18.130 --> 15:20.410]  I particularly liked it because it's actually grown
[15:20.410 --> 15:22.250]  in a climate that's colder than New York
[15:22.250 --> 15:23.610]  and has less sunlight.
[15:23.610 --> 15:25.170]  So that was encouraging to me to think
[15:25.170 --> 15:28.210]  if it's grown 100 plus thousand acres up there,
[15:28.210 --> 15:31.530]  wildly successfully, that we should be able to do it here
[15:31.530 --> 15:33.030]  in New York State.
[15:33.030 --> 15:34.090]  Just give you another statistic,
[15:34.090 --> 15:38.410]  about 1% of the households in US actually have hemp
[15:38.410 --> 15:40.050]  in their kitchen cabinets.
[15:40.050 --> 15:42.570]  And if you stop and you think about that as a superfood,
[15:42.570 --> 15:46.690]  as a vegan source of protein, great omega threes and sixes,
[15:46.690 --> 15:48.970]  in an area that people are looking at superfoods
[15:48.970 --> 15:52.210]  like flax, like chia, again, what I talked about up there
[15:52.210 --> 15:53.810]  in slightly different setting was simply
[15:53.810 --> 15:55.810]  that it should return to its rightful place
[15:55.810 --> 15:57.130]  as a crop rotation.
[15:57.130 --> 15:58.210]  It's not a panacea,
[15:58.210 --> 15:59.890]  it's not gonna change the world overnight.
[15:59.890 --> 16:02.250]  There's massive amounts of infrastructure investment
[16:02.250 --> 16:04.730]  that have to be made if you're going into biocomposites
[16:04.730 --> 16:08.290]  or materials, you know, fiber,
[16:08.290 --> 16:11.050]  those are things that have left the US
[16:11.050 --> 16:12.570]  and are gonna require, you know,
[16:12.570 --> 16:14.130]  tens of millions of dollars and more
[16:14.130 --> 16:15.330]  to bring back successfully
[16:15.330 --> 16:17.330]  if you're gonna have any type of scale.
[16:17.330 --> 16:21.290]  The simple path to production with hemp
[16:21.290 --> 16:22.930]  really is an agricultural setting.
[16:22.930 --> 16:27.090]  I can tell you that we used a grain drill out of the 1970s.
[16:27.090 --> 16:28.850]  We used a combine from a neighboring farm
[16:28.850 --> 16:30.690]  with a corn head on it.
[16:30.690 --> 16:33.450]  We plowed it with our plows in the 1970s.
[16:33.450 --> 16:35.410]  This is all off the shelf technology
[16:35.410 --> 16:38.410]  that's absolutely accessible to anyone in New York.
[16:38.410 --> 16:40.530]  In addition to that, pig pack manure,
[16:40.530 --> 16:43.050]  which we have, dairy liquid, dairy manure,
[16:43.050 --> 16:44.530]  and pelletized chicken manure.
[16:44.530 --> 16:47.250]  Again, all of these things are readily available
[16:47.250 --> 16:50.090]  and on a return on investment basis, makes sense.
[16:50.090 --> 16:52.130]  It absolutely makes sense to look at this.
[16:52.130 --> 16:53.930]  The stocks, when we finished harvesting
[16:53.930 --> 16:55.730]  with the grain head on the combine,
[16:55.730 --> 16:58.290]  thanks to Gianforte Farms' incredible partner,
[16:58.290 --> 17:00.730]  we used our existing square baling technology.
[17:00.730 --> 17:03.130]  We cut it with our rotary mower, we baled them up,
[17:03.810 --> 17:05.410]  and then we moved them to Katie Malia's
[17:05.410 --> 17:09.770]  Ecovative design for their biocomposite materials business.
[17:09.770 --> 17:12.050]  That replaced hemp that was coming in
[17:12.050 --> 17:12.970]  from Holland and France.
[17:12.970 --> 17:15.810]  Again, it didn't cost us any more to bale the hemp
[17:15.810 --> 17:18.050]  than it did to bale our own organic hay
[17:18.050 --> 17:19.490]  that we have going on right now.
[17:19.490 --> 17:21.050]  Look, we're an organic farm.
[17:21.050 --> 17:22.010]  I'm agnostic.
[17:22.010 --> 17:24.650]  We did it because it allows us to be more competitive
[17:24.650 --> 17:27.650]  versus the Midwest, which is obviously large conventional.
[17:27.650 --> 17:30.530]  In New York, we think organic's a slightly better way to go.
[17:30.530 --> 17:33.210]  People with large conventional farms in the Finger Lakes
[17:33.210 --> 17:34.610]  certainly could have baled themselves
[17:34.610 --> 17:36.850]  of conventional produced hemp.
[17:36.850 --> 17:38.530]  We have to talk about disease over time
[17:38.530 --> 17:39.970]  because it is a concern of ours, right,
[17:39.970 --> 17:42.270]  as we grow this business.
[17:43.610 --> 17:46.490]  The other thing that I think that makes a lot of sense
[17:46.490 --> 17:47.650]  is why would you go into hemp?
[17:47.650 --> 17:50.890]  Well, it's a market that's readily available right now.
[17:50.890 --> 17:51.850]  Look on the web.
[17:51.850 --> 17:52.690]  Take a look at the web.
[17:52.690 --> 17:54.010]  Look at the hemp seeds on the web.
[17:54.010 --> 17:56.790]  Look at the hemp and vegan protein powers on the web.
[17:56.790 --> 17:59.210]  Look at the hemp oil that's on the web already.
[17:59.210 --> 18:02.650]  All of that comes in from Canada or China.
[18:02.650 --> 18:05.530]  There's more interest in food transparency right now.
[18:05.530 --> 18:08.570]  So our consumers sitting next to this 11 million person
[18:08.570 --> 18:11.010]  marketplace in New York, it makes enormous sense
[18:11.010 --> 18:13.850]  for us to be very competitive in that marketplace.
[18:13.850 --> 18:15.850]  So the other thing that I would tell you as well
[18:15.850 --> 18:18.490]  to attract investors, find great partners.
[18:18.490 --> 18:20.370]  You know, Gianforte Farms that had the combine.
[18:20.370 --> 18:21.530]  We were working with them.
[18:21.530 --> 18:24.530]  They have enormous talent in the grain area.
[18:24.530 --> 18:26.490]  We found millers that are right off the shelf
[18:26.490 --> 18:28.650]  in the Hudson Valley that are milling our hemp flour
[18:28.650 --> 18:29.770]  for us right now.
[18:29.770 --> 18:31.890]  We found presses in the Hudson Valley
[18:31.890 --> 18:34.410]  that are pressing our oil to separate the oil from the seed
[18:34.410 --> 18:35.810]  cake to go there.
[18:35.810 --> 18:37.730]  In Brooklyn, in the food tech area,
[18:37.730 --> 18:40.210]  there's no one better in the United States
[18:40.210 --> 18:42.810]  than New York in terms of food tech and innovative food.
[18:42.810 --> 18:44.390]  You know, we'd like to see, obviously,
[18:44.390 --> 18:46.810]  that in the Southern tier as well, in the Binghamton area.
[18:46.810 --> 18:48.930]  More food processing there as well.
[18:48.930 --> 18:51.490]  But all of this stuff is ready made and set up.
[18:51.490 --> 18:53.570]  So when you go out and you talk to investors, right,
[18:53.570 --> 18:55.530]  which we've done, it's OK.
[18:55.530 --> 18:56.570]  Is the market big enough?
[18:56.570 --> 18:57.130]  Yes.
[18:57.130 --> 18:59.890]  What's your ROI when you start investing in the business?
[18:59.890 --> 19:00.810]  Well, it makes sense.
[19:00.810 --> 19:02.490]  It's scalable, right?
[19:02.490 --> 19:04.850]  You can start with 30 acres, go to 100, go to 200,
[19:04.850 --> 19:06.970]  go to thousands of acres over time.
[19:06.970 --> 19:09.770]  So where it gets more difficult is
[19:09.770 --> 19:13.890]  if you have a more restricted legislative environment
[19:13.890 --> 19:15.690]  where people are asking questions like, well,
[19:15.690 --> 19:16.610]  do you have a license?
[19:16.610 --> 19:19.250]  How does the license processing work?
[19:19.250 --> 19:22.370]  You can't say enough about what happened in Albany
[19:22.370 --> 19:24.890]  because they basically are opening up the licenses.
[19:24.890 --> 19:26.650]  For next year, if you lift the cap,
[19:26.650 --> 19:30.210]  it's going to basically open up to all farmers in the States
[19:30.210 --> 19:32.650]  that have a rational plan to attack this.
[19:32.650 --> 19:34.850]  That's going to be a huge difference for detracting
[19:34.850 --> 19:35.970]  investment dollars.
[19:35.970 --> 19:38.650]  Initially, when we started, we actually planted the crop
[19:38.650 --> 19:40.890]  and didn't know if we could actually even harvest it.
[19:40.890 --> 19:43.810]  So we've come a long way in the last year.
[19:43.810 --> 19:47.090]  So I think, again, a good ROI business,
[19:47.090 --> 19:49.530]  a business that there's a wide and large marketplace
[19:49.530 --> 19:52.410]  to be able to attack, an easy path.
[19:52.410 --> 19:54.010]  Pick the easiest path to production,
[19:54.010 --> 19:55.970]  which is actually putting seeds in the ground,
[19:55.970 --> 19:58.610]  working with smart local partners to get stuff done.
[19:58.610 --> 20:01.810]  Internet 2.0 is the processing facilities,
[20:01.810 --> 20:04.330]  the hubs in which you're actually
[20:04.330 --> 20:06.290]  going to drive more of this cooperative model,
[20:06.290 --> 20:08.170]  as Susie articulated.
[20:08.170 --> 20:11.650]  That, we think, is a tremendous opportunity for farmers.
[20:11.650 --> 20:14.210]  And again, it's growing to the north of us.
[20:14.210 --> 20:15.770]  They're growing it successfully.
[20:15.770 --> 20:17.890]  We think we should have our rightful place in that.
[20:17.890 --> 20:19.690]  So I think it's a pretty easy model
[20:19.690 --> 20:22.090]  to attract dollars if you have a rational plan of attack
[20:22.090 --> 20:22.650]  to do it.
[20:22.650 --> 20:23.530]  So I'll stop there.
[20:23.530 --> 20:27.810]  Dan's going to talk a little bit about the downside.
[20:27.810 --> 20:33.170]  Sure, I'm going to be the skunk in the hemp garden, I guess.
[20:33.170 --> 20:36.610]  I just want to caution that just because you put it
[20:36.610 --> 20:38.210]  in the ground doesn't mean people
[20:38.210 --> 20:39.830]  are going to come knocking at your door
[20:39.830 --> 20:41.650]  and pay you x amount of dollars.
[20:41.650 --> 20:46.410]  I think a lot of the hemp market still needs to be explored.
[20:46.410 --> 20:48.250]  And there's some great research being done
[20:48.250 --> 20:50.410]  in textiles and biomaterials.
[20:50.410 --> 20:51.850]  But that doesn't necessarily mean
[20:51.850 --> 20:55.010]  that the market is there yet for an entrepreneur
[20:55.010 --> 20:58.490]  to assume that they're going to go and raise money off of that.
[20:58.490 --> 21:01.130]  So you really have to have a plan
[21:01.130 --> 21:04.810]  and treat this as an entrepreneurial venture where
[21:04.810 --> 21:08.250]  you understand the market you're going into, how it all works.
[21:08.250 --> 21:10.010]  And also, I'll contradict myself, too.
[21:10.010 --> 21:11.890]  As much as you can have a plan, and we
[21:11.890 --> 21:15.090]  like to say one of Mike Tyson's favorite quotes
[21:15.090 --> 21:17.570]  is, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.
[21:17.570 --> 21:20.410]  So it is farming.
[21:20.410 --> 21:22.050]  And there is a seasonality.
[21:22.050 --> 21:24.010]  And there is crop loss.
[21:24.010 --> 21:27.210]  And there is also the regulations
[21:27.210 --> 21:28.330]  and the federal framework.
[21:28.330 --> 21:31.050]  And there's a lot of confusion right now
[21:31.050 --> 21:33.490]  in terms of what's going to happen with hemp
[21:33.490 --> 21:37.490]  and how it's treated and how it's treated in comparison
[21:37.490 --> 21:39.490]  to marijuana and whatnot.
[21:39.490 --> 21:42.170]  So there's a lot of murkiness out there.
[21:42.170 --> 21:44.410]  It doesn't mean that it's a great crop.
[21:44.410 --> 21:45.450]  It absolutely is.
[21:45.450 --> 21:46.910]  And it's got a lot of versatility.
[21:46.950 --> 21:49.190]  And there are 25,000 different uses.
[21:49.190 --> 21:51.390]  But that doesn't mean that there's 25,000 different
[21:51.390 --> 21:51.990]  markets.
[21:51.990 --> 21:54.150]  So I just want to encourage people
[21:54.150 --> 21:55.830]  who are applying for a license.
[21:55.830 --> 21:57.110]  And I hope you all do.
[21:57.110 --> 22:00.230]  And I hope you all really, really research and investigate
[22:00.230 --> 22:03.270]  what's the best path for you to explore,
[22:03.270 --> 22:06.030]  be that on the food side, on the textile side,
[22:06.030 --> 22:07.030]  on the biomaterial side.
[22:07.030 --> 22:11.190]  I'm happy to address any of those industries in questions.
[22:11.190 --> 22:16.430]  But I think just it's not going to serve New York.
[22:16.430 --> 22:18.910]  And it's not going to serve the industry well
[22:18.910 --> 22:23.790]  if we have crops, thousands of acres put in the ground,
[22:23.790 --> 22:26.750]  but nowhere to really offload or sell them.
[22:26.750 --> 22:31.790]  So it's important that we treat this as a rising tide
[22:31.790 --> 22:32.550]  in many ways.
[22:32.550 --> 22:34.590]  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[22:34.590 --> 22:40.230]  And if we all help develop the market
[22:40.230 --> 22:46.350]  and help establish the pathway to success
[22:46.350 --> 22:48.870]  together, I think that'll create an industry
[22:48.870 --> 22:52.190]  where other farmers will take notice.
[22:52.190 --> 22:54.910]  And I think the question this morning or this afternoon about,
[22:54.910 --> 22:57.310]  is this an expansion or a shift?
[22:57.310 --> 22:58.670]  And I do think it's both.
[22:58.670 --> 23:01.310]  But I think it's going to be the early adopters that really
[23:01.310 --> 23:04.230]  have to find those markets and establish and grow them
[23:04.230 --> 23:06.470]  for farmers to really figure out,
[23:06.470 --> 23:10.230]  are they going to replace corn or wheat or soy with hemp?
[23:10.230 --> 23:11.950]  Or are they going to buy additional land?
[23:11.950 --> 23:14.510]  Or are they going to convert the conventional dairies over
[23:14.510 --> 23:16.830]  to hemp crops?
[23:16.830 --> 23:18.070]  And I hope that does happen.
[23:18.070 --> 23:20.190]  And I could see that happening down the road.
[23:20.190 --> 23:22.550]  I just want to make sure that the folks who get into this
[23:22.550 --> 23:24.550]  get into this for the right reason.
[23:24.550 --> 23:26.870]  And they're not just throwing those seeds in the ground,
[23:26.870 --> 23:30.390]  thinking that it's going to be a cure for everything
[23:30.390 --> 23:31.110]  that ails them.
[23:31.110 --> 23:32.150]  It's not a panacea.
[23:32.150 --> 23:33.870]  But it is an excellent crop.
[23:33.870 --> 23:37.750]  It can make a tremendous, valuable addition
[23:37.750 --> 23:42.550]  to existing agricultural land.
[23:42.550 --> 23:43.470]  Well, thank you both.
[23:43.470 --> 23:44.270]  A round of applause.
[23:44.270 --> 23:44.770]  Thanks.
[23:44.770 --> 23:45.270]  Thank you.
[23:45.270 --> 23:49.520]  Thank you.
[23:49.520 --> 23:52.280]  We appreciate both your experience and your optimism
[23:52.280 --> 23:54.760]  and your risk tolerance for getting this started.
[23:54.760 --> 23:57.120]  But after all, it does really start with the customer,
[23:57.120 --> 24:00.800]  who's going to buy this stuff that we like to grow.
[24:00.800 --> 24:05.000]  Our next panelist, Dr. Christine Smart from Cornell,
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.840]  will talk to us a little bit about hemp varieties.
[24:08.840 --> 24:11.560]  Hi, I am the interim director of the School
[24:11.560 --> 24:13.320]  of Integrative Plant Science here
[24:13.320 --> 24:15.040]  at Cornell.
[24:15.040 --> 24:17.000]  For those of you who weren't here this morning,
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.560]  that's a school of about 900 people.
[24:19.560 --> 24:22.080]  We have a breadth of scientific activities
[24:22.080 --> 24:24.800]  going on from basic understanding of how plants
[24:24.800 --> 24:29.800]  work to many folks that look to solve problems that are
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.680]  affecting New York agriculture today.
[24:33.680 --> 24:38.440]  When we heard about the opportunity for hemp
[24:38.440 --> 24:41.880]  to be grown statewide, again, thanks
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.680]  to the work of our colleagues in Albany, we were excited.
[24:46.680 --> 24:49.120]  We got a group of people together here
[24:49.120 --> 24:52.120]  to try to figure out what barriers might we
[24:52.120 --> 24:56.320]  see or identify in possible production
[24:56.320 --> 24:59.040]  and having more growers grow hemp,
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.600]  and how might we work with growers, with industry people,
[25:03.600 --> 25:07.280]  with legislators, with really everyone in this room
[25:07.280 --> 25:10.480]  to break down some of those barriers.
[25:10.480 --> 25:13.440]  One of the first things that we tend
[25:13.440 --> 25:19.040]  to do in the plant science is when, oh, we have a problem
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.240]  or we have a new plant, one of the things that we always do
[25:22.240 --> 25:25.680]  is say, all right, let's get as many different types
[25:25.680 --> 25:28.840]  of this plant as we can and do variety trials.
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.000]  And probably between the plant scientists
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.760]  that are in this room, we have done 100,000 variety trials
[25:35.760 --> 25:39.000]  of all kinds of plants across the state.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.560]  That's one of the things that we do,
[25:40.560 --> 25:42.960]  and that's the first thing that we're doing with hemp.
[25:42.960 --> 25:45.040]  And Don, as he mentioned earlier,
[25:45.040 --> 25:46.720]  he started that last year.
[25:46.720 --> 25:48.920]  And with Don's leadership, we're going
[25:48.920 --> 25:52.400]  to expand that in 2017 to three different sites.
[25:52.400 --> 25:55.240]  I think to date we have 17 different varieties
[25:55.240 --> 25:56.700]  that we're going to be looking at.
[25:56.700 --> 26:01.280]  And as Don said, some are fiber, some are oil, and some are dual.
[26:01.280 --> 26:02.600]  And we don't know yet.
[26:02.600 --> 26:03.980]  I mean, at least to my knowledge,
[26:03.980 --> 26:07.520]  we really don't know in each of those categories
[26:07.520 --> 26:09.960]  what commercially available varieties are really
[26:09.960 --> 26:12.360]  going to work best for folks in New York.
[26:12.360 --> 26:14.760]  And not folks anywhere in New York.
[26:14.760 --> 26:17.560]  My guess is that different varieties
[26:17.560 --> 26:21.680]  are going to be more well-suited to different locations.
[26:21.680 --> 26:24.480]  Someone on the top of a hill in the southern tier
[26:24.480 --> 26:27.200]  is going to want probably a very different variety than someone
[26:27.200 --> 26:28.840]  that's growing on Long Island.
[26:28.840 --> 26:31.760]  And so we want to start to figure out what
[26:31.760 --> 26:33.120]  varieties are going to grow best.
[26:33.120 --> 26:35.760]  There might be some areas that are much more well-suited
[26:35.760 --> 26:38.560]  to fiber production compared to oil production.
[26:38.560 --> 26:41.400]  And those are the kinds of things we really need to know
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.080]  so that we can enable growers to get the best
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.600]  yield that they can.
[26:45.600 --> 26:46.920]  So how are we going to do that?
[26:46.920 --> 26:50.880]  Well, the varieties that are commercially available right
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.800]  now, A, as we've heard I think 35 times today,
[26:55.800 --> 26:58.040]  they're kind of hard to get the seed.
[26:58.040 --> 27:03.440]  And on top of that, none of them were grown specifically
[27:03.440 --> 27:04.280]  for New York.
[27:04.720 --> 27:06.720]  So that's a challenge for us that we don't know.
[27:06.720 --> 27:08.400]  We assume that varieties from Canada,
[27:08.400 --> 27:10.400]  we have some evidence that varieties from Canada
[27:10.400 --> 27:10.920]  will do well.
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.920]  But there's varieties from Colorado or Kentucky or Europe.
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.160]  How are those going to work?
[27:16.160 --> 27:17.780]  And we want to be able to compare that.
[27:17.780 --> 27:20.000]  Not only do we want to be able to look at those,
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  but we want the growers of New York
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.600]  to be able to look at those.
[27:23.600 --> 27:26.440]  And so for this first year, as Don mentioned,
[27:26.440 --> 27:27.520]  we're going to have tours.
[27:27.520 --> 27:30.880]  But we specifically will have some field days.
[27:30.880 --> 27:35.840]  So to enable you guys to look at the commercially available
[27:35.840 --> 27:39.040]  varieties and decide what you want to grow.
[27:39.040 --> 27:42.160]  I mean, who am I to tell you what to grow?
[27:42.160 --> 27:44.640]  You're way better at growing things than I am.
[27:44.640 --> 27:47.960]  So what we want to do is enable you to make that choice.
[27:47.960 --> 27:49.240]  Come to our fields.
[27:49.240 --> 27:50.200]  Look at the grain.
[27:50.200 --> 27:51.080]  Look at the height.
[27:51.080 --> 27:52.280]  Look at the fiber.
[27:52.280 --> 27:56.680]  And hopefully, we'll be able to learn as much, or in my case,
[27:56.680 --> 27:58.720]  I would love to learn way more from you
[27:58.720 --> 28:00.280]  than what you can learn from us.
[28:00.280 --> 28:02.200]  And I think that working together,
[28:02.200 --> 28:04.760]  we'll be able to then start to knock down
[28:04.760 --> 28:06.680]  some of these barriers.
[28:06.680 --> 28:09.880]  One of the things I'm really personally interested in
[28:09.880 --> 28:13.280]  is looking at the disease and insect pest issues
[28:13.280 --> 28:15.480]  that we might face here in New York.
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.160]  So I'm an administrator three days a week.
[28:19.160 --> 28:20.640]  Well, really, seven days a week.
[28:20.640 --> 28:23.760]  But I'm definitely a plant pathologist two days a week.
[28:23.760 --> 28:28.840]  And my background is in diseases of vegetables.
[28:28.880 --> 28:32.480]  I hopefully, Commissioner Ball, help the vegetable growers
[28:32.480 --> 28:37.640]  of the state of New York grow healthy fruits and vegetables.
[28:37.640 --> 28:39.480]  One thing that we really don't know
[28:39.480 --> 28:42.000]  is what kind of disease and insect pressure
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.520]  are we going to have on hemp here in the state.
[28:44.520 --> 28:46.440]  Last year, there was 30 acres.
[28:46.440 --> 28:48.040]  It's a pretty small target.
[28:48.040 --> 28:49.520]  And it was the first year.
[28:49.520 --> 28:52.400]  So we wouldn't really expect, thankfully,
[28:52.400 --> 28:55.440]  to have huge disease or insect pressures.
[28:55.440 --> 28:59.560]  As we have more hemp grown for a larger number of years,
[28:59.560 --> 29:02.080]  we're definitely going to expect to see more disease
[29:02.080 --> 29:04.440]  and insect issues pop up.
[29:04.440 --> 29:08.440]  This is an opportunity for us to really be ahead of the game.
[29:08.440 --> 29:11.880]  If we can, we will, thanks to funding
[29:11.880 --> 29:15.000]  from the state of New York, we will be surveying,
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.760]  I hope to survey, every hemp field in New York this summer.
[29:19.760 --> 29:22.320]  I think that won't be a huge number.
[29:22.320 --> 29:25.760]  But we want to get a feel for what our growers are seeing,
[29:25.760 --> 29:27.600]  what we see at our research trials.
[29:27.600 --> 29:29.240]  And it'll be really interesting to see
[29:29.240 --> 29:31.920]  what we see in those different variety trials.
[29:31.920 --> 29:34.840]  So are there some varieties that those Japanese beetles
[29:34.840 --> 29:35.800]  don't land on?
[29:35.800 --> 29:37.720]  That would be really interesting to know.
[29:37.720 --> 29:39.400]  These guys saw a lot of Japanese beetles.
[29:39.400 --> 29:40.880]  We don't know that they caused any damage,
[29:40.880 --> 29:42.160]  but they might in the future.
[29:42.160 --> 29:45.320]  So those are the kinds of things these variety trials are really
[29:45.320 --> 29:47.120]  going to help us with.
[29:47.120 --> 29:51.240]  The other thing I wanted to talk about in terms of where
[29:51.240 --> 29:56.760]  we see Cornell going with this is in 2018,
[29:56.760 --> 30:00.720]  we will have, I hope, that we will be able to have trials
[30:00.720 --> 30:05.720]  across the state, additional trials on research farms,
[30:05.720 --> 30:09.120]  including in the North Country at places like Willsboro,
[30:09.120 --> 30:12.000]  perhaps in Lake Placid, additional places here
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.560]  in the Southern Tier, to get a better feel, again,
[30:14.560 --> 30:18.040]  for what varieties are going to grow in different places.
[30:18.040 --> 30:21.520]  One issue that we know that we'll have a problem with
[30:21.520 --> 30:24.400]  is stand establishment.
[30:24.400 --> 30:27.440]  Are those seeds going to germinate and really establish?
[30:27.440 --> 30:30.600]  Well, Alan Taylor is going to look at, are there ways,
[30:30.600 --> 30:34.240]  are there things that we can do to increase that stand
[30:34.240 --> 30:35.960]  establishment so your plants really
[30:35.960 --> 30:39.560]  have a great start to life?
[30:39.560 --> 30:42.440]  Otherwise, you could be in real trouble.
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.800]  Additionally, we hope to have trials in conjunction
[30:46.800 --> 30:48.840]  with some of the growers here in New York.
[30:48.840 --> 30:51.080]  One of the things we do very frequently
[30:51.080 --> 30:54.600]  is have either a demonstration trial on a grower's field.
[30:54.600 --> 30:57.320]  We say, hey, we think this variety might be pretty good.
[30:57.320 --> 30:58.400]  We're not positive.
[30:58.400 --> 31:00.520]  We'd love for you to try it on your field.
[31:00.520 --> 31:02.520]  And then we'll have a day where people can come in and look
[31:02.520 --> 31:03.120]  at it.
[31:03.120 --> 31:05.720]  Or sometimes growers will come to me and say, hey,
[31:05.720 --> 31:07.520]  I think I have this really great idea.
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.920]  Let's try to do this experiment on my farm
[31:09.920 --> 31:11.440]  and look at the differences.
[31:11.440 --> 31:13.880]  So I think in 2018, those are the kinds of things
[31:13.880 --> 31:16.000]  that we'll really see happening.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.840]  A great partnership that many of you know we have
[31:18.840 --> 31:21.200]  is with Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[31:21.200 --> 31:25.280]  And with funds, again, that the state has discussed today,
[31:25.280 --> 31:29.280]  we will have three cooperative extension point of contacts
[31:29.280 --> 31:30.760]  here in New York.
[31:30.760 --> 31:34.480]  The first one will be here in the southern tier,
[31:34.480 --> 31:36.120]  Janice Degney.
[31:36.120 --> 31:38.760]  And then we'll have two in the north country, Mike Hunter
[31:38.760 --> 31:40.120]  and Kitty O'Neill.
[31:40.120 --> 31:42.440]  And these folks will be eyes and ears
[31:42.440 --> 31:45.720]  in the fields in locations where those of us
[31:46.440 --> 31:49.640]  that are on the Ithaca or Geneva campuses are not.
[31:49.640 --> 31:52.040]  One really cool thing is that we will also
[31:52.040 --> 31:55.440]  have a Harvest New York specialist working
[31:55.440 --> 31:57.920]  on the economics of hemp.
[31:57.920 --> 32:00.160]  As many folks have talked about, we really
[32:00.160 --> 32:04.240]  need to get a better handle on the inputs versus the outputs.
[32:04.240 --> 32:08.400]  And so I think that will be a huge help to our hemp team.
[32:08.400 --> 32:11.360]  One of the things that I think many of us have realized today
[32:11.360 --> 32:14.120]  is that we are actually a hemp team.
[32:14.120 --> 32:15.400]  It's kind of interesting.
[32:15.560 --> 32:18.000]  It's a fairly large group, but it's really actually
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  kind of small at the same time.
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.240]  And so I'm really certain that working together,
[32:24.440 --> 32:27.920]  we can help establish a strong foundation
[32:27.920 --> 32:30.720]  for an industrial hemp industry here in New York.
[32:32.040 --> 32:33.040]  Thank you, Dr. Smart.
[32:33.040 --> 32:39.620]  Thank you so much, panelists.
[32:39.620 --> 32:41.940]  We do have a couple of questions from the crowd.
[32:42.900 --> 32:46.940]  This first one is for Dr. Nuttavalli and Suzy Cody both.
[32:48.460 --> 32:49.540]  I'll read it all, actually.
[32:49.540 --> 32:52.980]  Hemp was my grandmother's favorite dish towel fabric.
[32:52.980 --> 32:55.060]  She would search for it at estate sales
[32:55.060 --> 32:58.060]  when it was no longer available in fabric stores.
[32:58.060 --> 32:59.980]  The chefs in New York have driven much
[32:59.980 --> 33:02.340]  of our grown in New York education.
[33:02.340 --> 33:04.020]  Would they be a good pilot market
[33:04.020 --> 33:06.780]  to begin popularizing hemp fabric?
[33:06.780 --> 33:08.900]  They would likely be likely to appreciate
[33:08.900 --> 33:12.220]  its absorbency and long lasting aspects.
[33:13.220 --> 33:15.180]  You wanna go ahead?
[33:15.180 --> 33:18.780]  Yeah, I strongly encourage anybody to experiment
[33:18.780 --> 33:23.500]  with making any products with hemp or anything like that
[33:23.500 --> 33:26.300]  to start getting people familiarized
[33:26.300 --> 33:27.460]  with the products again.
[33:27.460 --> 33:29.940]  And even if it starts at a small scale,
[33:29.940 --> 33:31.980]  I mean, that's how this movement has grown
[33:31.980 --> 33:34.460]  from a small scale and now look at it.
[33:34.460 --> 33:39.460]  So yeah, we definitely need to educate our population
[33:40.460 --> 33:43.060]  as to what the products are like,
[33:43.060 --> 33:46.180]  what they're capable of and be using them.
[33:46.180 --> 33:47.140]  That's the key.
[33:48.740 --> 33:52.580]  Yeah, I just would like to echo her response.
[33:52.580 --> 33:55.380]  I'm happy to hear that at least somebody remembers
[33:55.380 --> 33:56.620]  grandmother using it.
[33:57.580 --> 34:00.120]  The fibers are really nice.
[34:00.120 --> 34:04.740]  They absorb more moisture or water than cotton.
[34:04.740 --> 34:07.640]  They can be made very soft, cotton-like
[34:07.640 --> 34:10.720]  and they could be also woven in different designs
[34:10.720 --> 34:12.640]  to feel soft.
[34:12.640 --> 34:15.640]  So of course, there's a large opportunity
[34:15.640 --> 34:19.860]  for doing trials and bringing the products to market.
[34:21.160 --> 34:23.600]  Yeah, I heard earlier today somewhere around north
[34:23.600 --> 34:26.680]  of 25,000 potential uses for this.
[34:26.680 --> 34:28.440]  Hopefully at our 10th summit,
[34:28.440 --> 34:32.080]  we'll talk about getting to 50,000 uses of the product,
[34:32.080 --> 34:33.760]  but certainly that's a great one.
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.840]  Next question.
[34:36.840 --> 34:39.720]  Is there a role for a formal cooperative structure
[34:39.720 --> 34:41.600]  to help develop markets?
[34:41.600 --> 34:43.360]  And I think the comparison was drawn
[34:43.360 --> 34:46.480]  to what we currently do for our dairy industry
[34:46.480 --> 34:48.360]  to help grow the dairy business.
[34:51.920 --> 34:55.280]  I would say that the answer is absolutely.
[34:55.280 --> 34:58.560]  I think that having that set up in New York
[34:58.560 --> 35:00.320]  would be amazing and I think that's something
[35:00.320 --> 35:03.360]  that under the leadership of Albany
[35:03.960 --> 35:05.760]  could be very effective because if you look at Canada
[35:05.760 --> 35:08.520]  right now and you think of the size of the crops
[35:08.520 --> 35:10.680]  that are going on there and the hundreds of thousands
[35:10.680 --> 35:14.200]  of acres, for us to be able to build the types
[35:14.200 --> 35:17.880]  of continuous processing plants for fiber
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.440]  or for biomaterials or for that matter, for de-hulling,
[35:22.640 --> 35:26.200]  those types of CapEx require huge amounts
[35:26.200 --> 35:28.760]  of throughput of crop and I think setting up
[35:28.760 --> 35:30.760]  a formal cooperative or buying structure
[35:30.760 --> 35:32.180]  makes an enormous amount of sense
[35:32.180 --> 35:34.340]  because then those farmers that would prefer
[35:34.340 --> 35:36.940]  to do a contract-based sale could do that.
[35:36.940 --> 35:39.380]  Those people that wanted to more forward integrate
[35:39.380 --> 35:41.740]  and own some of that processing could also,
[35:41.740 --> 35:42.900]  there's an opportunity there.
[35:42.900 --> 35:45.420]  So I think that makes us much more competitive,
[35:45.420 --> 35:48.580]  much faster, so I would absolutely be in favor of that.
[35:48.580 --> 35:49.740]  Dan, would you disagree with me?
[35:49.740 --> 35:50.940]  No, I think that's right.
[35:50.940 --> 35:53.380]  I think that's, we touched on it a little this morning
[35:53.380 --> 35:56.260]  is that New York would really benefit
[35:56.260 --> 35:59.620]  from a processing hub and I think saying what I said
[35:59.620 --> 36:01.940]  before about don't assume when you put it in the ground
[36:02.700 --> 36:03.940]  that someone's gonna come knocking on your door to buy it.
[36:03.940 --> 36:05.900]  If we had a processing hub and a co-op
[36:05.900 --> 36:09.260]  that really was robust enough, you would be able
[36:09.260 --> 36:11.860]  to allow farmers to kind of treat it
[36:11.860 --> 36:12.900]  like a commodity crop.
[36:12.900 --> 36:17.180]  It's not something we necessarily wanna see subsidized
[36:17.180 --> 36:19.800]  but it's something that I think we wanna see there
[36:19.800 --> 36:21.340]  to be enough throughput and demand
[36:21.340 --> 36:23.980]  and I think having a co-op would really be the first step
[36:23.980 --> 36:24.980]  in creating that.
[36:24.980 --> 36:26.420]  Right, and lastly, I'd just add
[36:26.420 --> 36:28.000]  that the only national brands,
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.580]  if you look on any store shelves right now,
[36:29.860 --> 36:32.660]  it's Manitoba Harvest and Nativa
[36:32.660 --> 36:35.340]  and that's grown out of Canada
[36:35.340 --> 36:37.380]  and if you go to Whole Foods or you go to any place else
[36:37.380 --> 36:40.060]  and pick up, that's grown and that's been grown
[36:40.060 --> 36:42.340]  out of a cooperative model where basically
[36:42.340 --> 36:44.540]  they're aggregating in large processing facilities
[36:44.540 --> 36:46.940]  in Manitoba and then moving the stuff
[36:46.940 --> 36:49.020]  in mass across the border.
[36:49.020 --> 36:51.660]  I'm not advocating a tariff, I think we can compete
[36:51.660 --> 36:54.200]  but I mean, I think we can certainly
[36:54.200 --> 36:55.540]  be competitive with that.
[36:55.540 --> 36:57.980]  Yeah, I have a quick question for Dan and Mark.
[36:57.980 --> 37:01.580]  Are you in a position to describe the REDC grant
[37:01.580 --> 37:04.100]  that you got and where that's heading?
[37:04.100 --> 37:05.340]  People may find that interesting.
[37:05.340 --> 37:06.940]  I mean, they did receive some economic development.
[37:06.940 --> 37:09.500]  Yeah, I think we can talk about it.
[37:09.500 --> 37:13.260]  We are actually not going to take that grant presently
[37:13.260 --> 37:15.940]  and that's because where we looked at it
[37:15.940 --> 37:17.580]  and we looked and again, this came down to,
[37:17.580 --> 37:18.780]  it's kind of a good lesson
[37:18.780 --> 37:20.620]  because some of the things you learn is that,
[37:20.620 --> 37:21.580]  you know, we spent a lot of time
[37:21.580 --> 37:24.140]  going to the different hemp conferences around the country
[37:24.140 --> 37:26.100]  and if you look at the current processing
[37:26.100 --> 37:28.940]  that's going on with hemp in places like Kentucky
[37:28.940 --> 37:31.180]  and you look at, and Dr. Nettavalli and I
[37:31.180 --> 37:32.780]  were speaking to that just a little bit beforehand,
[37:32.780 --> 37:34.580]  it's like, you know, there's KNAF
[37:34.580 --> 37:36.460]  and other continuous process.
[37:36.460 --> 37:39.740]  That specific grant, having the type of throughput
[37:39.740 --> 37:42.700]  that you would need to build a large processing facility,
[37:42.700 --> 37:44.860]  we still thought for us, we were several years out
[37:44.860 --> 37:47.700]  to be able to do that and that's where a cooperative model
[37:47.700 --> 37:49.020]  where there was some risk sharing
[37:49.020 --> 37:51.020]  in these types of processing facilities
[37:51.020 --> 37:52.300]  would make a lot more sense.
[37:52.300 --> 37:54.860]  But I mean, here's the good thing is we applied
[37:54.860 --> 37:56.020]  for the grant over the summer
[37:56.020 --> 37:58.580]  and it goes back to having a plan,
[37:58.580 --> 38:00.780]  being able to be flexible enough to pivot.
[38:02.260 --> 38:04.300]  We initially thought, as Mark was saying,
[38:04.300 --> 38:07.940]  that we would kind of build this processing plant ourselves
[38:07.940 --> 38:10.140]  but really we were the only game in town
[38:10.140 --> 38:13.060]  so we were just putting our 30 acres through that
[38:13.060 --> 38:15.860]  which is not nearly enough and we've done research
[38:15.860 --> 38:20.860]  and really you need 50,000 basically acres of hemp
[38:21.900 --> 38:24.660]  to really justify the capex of a-
[38:25.460 --> 38:26.980]  For a major processing plant.
[38:26.980 --> 38:29.700]  That's why there aren't very many around the country.
[38:29.700 --> 38:33.420]  Kentucky is in the process of building one, you know,
[38:33.420 --> 38:38.420]  and I really encourage the state to invest in that
[38:39.380 --> 38:41.580]  or invest in people like Mark Privatera
[38:41.580 --> 38:44.580]  who is, Mark, you could raise your hand.
[38:44.580 --> 38:46.540]  So he's the guy who I think, you know,
[38:46.540 --> 38:51.300]  is positioned to create that type of plant
[38:51.300 --> 38:53.980]  and I think could use as much of the state's support
[38:54.220 --> 38:56.820]  as possible and I think as the industry grows,
[38:56.820 --> 38:58.460]  we hopefully will have enough throughput
[38:58.460 --> 39:00.980]  to justify that capex.
[39:00.980 --> 39:03.980]  We turned down the grant but I think the good news
[39:03.980 --> 39:08.500]  is that if you apply and you discuss hemp
[39:08.500 --> 39:09.740]  and you make the case for it
[39:09.740 --> 39:11.540]  that you can actually receive that.
[39:12.820 --> 39:14.580]  It certainly has been a good model
[39:14.580 --> 39:17.500]  in many areas of agriculture around the country
[39:17.500 --> 39:20.300]  that there is protection and it offers an opportunity
[39:20.300 --> 39:22.820]  to mitigate risk but also to work collectively
[39:22.860 --> 39:24.780]  to protect it in a marketplace
[39:24.780 --> 39:27.780]  that needs to be understood a little bit better yet.
[39:27.780 --> 39:30.780]  Great question and great answers, thank you.
[39:32.220 --> 39:34.380]  Next question is how can the industry overcome
[39:34.380 --> 39:37.340]  misconceptions about hemp and become more widely adopted
[39:37.340 --> 39:40.280]  by farms of all sizes and across the state?
[39:43.660 --> 39:46.980]  I think that's, I think the biggest challenge
[39:46.980 --> 39:51.020]  facing the industry and I've spent a lot of time in DC
[39:52.020 --> 39:54.860]  both in my prior life working for government
[39:54.860 --> 39:59.380]  but recently with Eric Steenshrer's help
[39:59.380 --> 40:02.140]  and the great work he's doing with Vote Hemp,
[40:03.460 --> 40:05.540]  talking to congressmen and senators
[40:05.540 --> 40:08.700]  and there are some who get it and they instantly understand
[40:08.700 --> 40:12.180]  that hemp is agriculture and marijuana is horticulture
[40:12.180 --> 40:15.140]  and there's a big difference between the two
[40:15.140 --> 40:17.500]  both on the regulatory side
[40:17.500 --> 40:19.860]  but also on the sort of genetic side
[40:19.940 --> 40:24.940]  and just encourage people to educate their congressmen,
[40:28.100 --> 40:31.640]  their elected officials, make their voice heard.
[40:32.540 --> 40:35.620]  I think, you know, I was saying again this morning
[40:35.620 --> 40:38.520]  that hemp is actually, should be law enforcement's
[40:38.520 --> 40:41.960]  favorite tool because it's, the cross-pollination
[40:41.960 --> 40:44.300]  helps eradicate illicit marijuana.
[40:44.300 --> 40:46.580]  I'm not for or against that per se
[40:46.580 --> 40:49.100]  but it is something that comes up a lot that,
[40:49.100 --> 40:53.660]  well, hemp is a sort of gateway crop to growing marijuana
[40:53.660 --> 40:57.180]  and it's like throwing raw meat into the lion's den.
[40:57.180 --> 41:00.460]  I mean, it's the last place you'd wanna put marijuana
[41:00.460 --> 41:02.340]  is into a field of hemp.
[41:02.340 --> 41:04.620]  In fact, you know, we grew 30 acres
[41:04.620 --> 41:07.600]  and I'm sure we upset a lot of folks
[41:07.600 --> 41:09.740]  who had little backyard grows in their,
[41:10.900 --> 41:14.140]  on their land and it's just one of those things
[41:14.140 --> 41:17.500]  that people aren't aware enough of the difference
[41:17.500 --> 41:21.780]  and I think it's 3% of households
[41:21.780 --> 41:26.380]  understand that difference and there's so much education.
[41:26.380 --> 41:31.380]  So I support to, you know, looking at vote hemp
[41:32.460 --> 41:35.940]  and kind of signing up when there's actions to take
[41:35.940 --> 41:38.480]  to inform your congressmen and signing petitions
[41:38.480 --> 41:40.540]  and whatnot because that's really the only way
[41:40.540 --> 41:42.740]  we'll overcome the education gap.
[41:42.740 --> 41:44.780]  And maybe, you know, addressing the small farms issue
[41:44.780 --> 41:46.980]  because obviously that is, if you're going to go out
[41:47.460 --> 41:49.620]  and do this, you don't wanna have to spend six months
[41:49.620 --> 41:51.940]  as we talked about getting a DEA permit.
[41:51.940 --> 41:54.460]  I think that the biggest thing to make this more accessible
[41:54.460 --> 41:57.060]  to farms of all sizes because the technology exists
[41:57.060 --> 41:59.140]  to put this in the ground and harvest it
[41:59.140 --> 42:02.540]  is really the seed issue and the permitting
[42:02.540 --> 42:04.260]  to make it available and having that run out
[42:04.260 --> 42:05.540]  of the Department of Agriculture.
[42:05.540 --> 42:09.460]  That probably is the single biggest gating factor
[42:09.460 --> 42:11.940]  for everyone here today because if you're opening up
[42:11.940 --> 42:14.500]  the caps on permits, that's the last straw.
[42:14.540 --> 42:18.180]  And working with universities like Cornell
[42:18.180 --> 42:21.580]  in terms of establishing seed programs in the states,
[42:21.580 --> 42:25.180]  in New York, that will really open up the floodgates
[42:25.180 --> 42:26.220]  for the industry, I think.
[42:26.220 --> 42:27.740]  So that was probably the most important thing
[42:27.740 --> 42:31.300]  that I got out of today was getting that permitting process
[42:31.300 --> 42:32.800]  from the state level.
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.080]  Thank you.
[42:34.080 --> 42:36.460]  And we have time for just one more question.
[42:37.380 --> 42:39.860]  And this one is basically kind of a federal issue
[42:39.860 --> 42:42.700]  but do we see the current philosophy coming out
[42:42.700 --> 42:46.780]  of Washington having any impact on the hemp industry?
[42:49.700 --> 42:51.900]  Yeah, Eric, do you wanna field that?
[42:51.900 --> 42:55.300]  I could take it from here but I think you'd probably
[42:55.300 --> 42:57.500]  be best positioned to address that.
[43:02.420 --> 43:04.300]  I guess it's really the change in administration
[43:04.300 --> 43:06.420]  and the current philosophy and approach to cannabis
[43:06.420 --> 43:08.620]  and how that's impacting the hemp industry.
[43:09.460 --> 43:40.980]  Yeah, I mean, you know, Jeff Sessions,
[43:40.980 --> 43:44.460]  he's a general, I don't think he's necessarily
[43:44.460 --> 43:46.300]  gonna focus on hemp but he's generally
[43:46.300 --> 43:47.740]  on cannabis and stuff.
[43:47.740 --> 43:50.940]  I feel like, I mean, the more that we see
[43:50.940 --> 43:52.580]  what's happening in the states like we were
[43:52.580 --> 43:54.620]  and what's happening here, it's really
[43:54.620 --> 43:56.940]  the main of our pressure as a federal government.
[43:56.940 --> 43:58.900]  And so, I mean, the biggest thing we should be doing
[43:58.900 --> 44:00.660]  is fill up the areas.
[44:07.720 --> 44:09.560]  We've already got some of the artificial land
[44:09.560 --> 44:12.040]  that we're working to do more and certainly
[44:12.040 --> 44:14.560]  the infrastructure part of it.
[44:14.560 --> 44:17.120]  So I think it's very much what we should be focusing on.
[44:17.120 --> 44:18.200]  Yeah.
[44:18.200 --> 44:21.200]  Thank you and I would wholeheartedly concur.
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.320]  I think the same answer as the previous question,
[44:25.320 --> 44:27.480]  it's really largely an education issue
[44:27.480 --> 44:30.240]  and I think when you get a chance to have
[44:30.240 --> 44:32.240]  that conversation, it will prevail
[44:32.240 --> 44:34.960]  because it obviously makes sense.
[44:34.960 --> 44:36.960]  I think programs like what we're doing here
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.640]  in New York help and I think especially,
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.720]  I'm a pretty New York-centric guy.
[44:42.720 --> 44:45.880]  I'm born and bred here and I tend to think
[44:45.880 --> 44:48.400]  if we can do it here, we can do it everywhere
[44:48.400 --> 44:50.960]  as the adage goes and so I really applaud
[44:50.960 --> 44:54.480]  the department and Udonna for the foresight
[44:54.480 --> 44:56.640]  and the vision and creating what I said,
[44:56.640 --> 44:58.120]  again, this morning, is I think we have
[44:58.120 --> 44:59.920]  the most permissive and progressive program
[44:59.920 --> 45:03.400]  in the country and in a matter of years,
[45:03.400 --> 45:06.280]  we will be the epicenter for all things hemp.
[45:06.280 --> 45:08.440]  Can we get a round of applause for all our panelists here?
[45:08.440 --> 45:09.280]  Thank you.
[45:09.280 --> 45:10.120]  Thank you.
[45:10.120 --> 45:10.960]  Thank you.
[45:10.960 --> 45:12.640]  Thank you so much.
[45:12.640 --> 45:16.120]  This has been a production of Cornell University
