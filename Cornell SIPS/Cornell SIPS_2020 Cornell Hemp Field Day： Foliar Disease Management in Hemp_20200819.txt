[00:00.570 --> 00:06.570]  Hello and welcome to the 2020 virtual Cornell Hemp Research Team Field Day.
[00:06.570 --> 00:12.130]  My name is Jennifer Starr and I am the research support specialist for Dr. Gary Bergstrom's
[00:12.130 --> 00:14.890]  Field Crops Pathology Laboratory.
[00:14.890 --> 00:19.570]  I also work alongside Kevin Myers who helps with scouting for hemp disease and does our
[00:19.570 --> 00:20.570]  molecular testing.
[00:20.570 --> 00:29.690]  Today I'll be giving a brief overview of foliar diseases and possible management strategies.
[00:29.690 --> 00:32.410]  I want to focus this talk on just a few things.
[00:32.410 --> 00:38.810]  To highlight, I will start with septoria leaf spot and bipolaris leaf spot, also known as
[00:38.810 --> 00:39.810]  hemp leaf spot.
[00:39.810 --> 00:46.250]  Then I will move to lesser impact emerging leaf diseases such as downy mildew and hemp
[00:46.250 --> 00:47.250]  rust.
[00:47.250 --> 00:56.880]  Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septorius species and symptoms begin on the
[00:56.880 --> 01:02.880]  lower leaves of the plant as irregularly shaped spots with yellow margins.
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.800]  These spots expand over time, turn brown, and the yellow margins broaden to look something
[01:08.800 --> 01:09.800]  like this.
[01:09.800 --> 01:21.600]  This was observed in eastern New York in 2019 and in eastern and western New York in 2020.
[01:21.600 --> 01:32.320]  In this slide I have a video of what septoria leaf spot looks like in the field.
[01:32.320 --> 01:38.000]  As you can see it is on the lower leaves and we see those brown spots with the bigger yellow
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  margins.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.810]  This is septoria leaf spot.
[01:45.810 --> 01:50.410]  The next highlight is bipolaris leaf spot, also known as hemp leaf spot.
[01:50.410 --> 01:58.090]  This is caused by a fungus that is being classified as bipolaris gigantea related to Dreshlara
[01:58.130 --> 01:59.130]  gigantea.
[01:59.130 --> 02:06.610]  Symptoms start as round specks and spots that coalesce over time and sometimes they have
[02:06.610 --> 02:14.850]  a dark margin here with lighter tan interiors or sometimes don't have any margin at all.
[02:14.850 --> 02:21.010]  We have noticed this leaf spot disease since Cornell's hemp team started the program a
[02:21.010 --> 02:26.130]  few years back and we usually notice this at the end of the growing season and we have
[02:26.130 --> 02:29.010]  noticed this throughout New York State.
[02:29.010 --> 02:36.210]  This is not a super high impact disease as other states have seen it defoliate plants.
[02:36.210 --> 02:43.450]  We have not seen that yet in New York State.
[02:43.450 --> 02:49.890]  Next up we have downy mildew, lesser impact emerging disease.
[02:49.890 --> 02:57.690]  This is caused by Pseudopernospora cannabina which has just been recently ID'd by sequencing
[02:57.690 --> 02:59.530]  last week.
[02:59.530 --> 03:06.170]  The spots start out as these light green yellow spots with necrotic margins and the lower
[03:06.170 --> 03:11.970]  surface of the leaf you can actually see the fungus growing in humid conditions or if you
[03:11.970 --> 03:17.970]  catch it in the morning time when the dew is still on the plant.
[03:17.970 --> 03:24.570]  Later on the lesions become a little more angular and are defined by the leaf veins
[03:24.570 --> 03:25.570]  of the hemp plant.
[03:26.250 --> 03:33.090]  This was just recently observed in Ithaca last week so in 2020.
[03:33.090 --> 03:41.940]  And in the next slide I have a video of what it looks like on the plant.
[03:41.940 --> 03:54.130]  And this is a good example of how the veins of the leaf are demarcating the spot and confining
[03:54.130 --> 03:58.250]  it as you see here.
[03:58.250 --> 04:03.800]  This is downy mildew on hemp.
[04:03.800 --> 04:07.000]  Our last feature is hemp rust.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.320]  And hemp rust has been morphologically identified as Eurydocregariana.
[04:12.320 --> 04:15.440]  And again this is something we're going to want to be looking at the lower surface of
[04:15.440 --> 04:16.600]  the leaf.
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.000]  We have yellow to orange pustules or spots on the lower surface and on the upper surface
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.480]  we have these necrotic areas with very faint chlorosis around them.
[04:29.920 --> 04:35.560]  And then sometimes rust disease systems have alternate hosts to complete their life cycle.
[04:35.560 --> 04:39.800]  We have not found an alternate host with this hemp rust.
[04:39.800 --> 04:43.160]  Sometimes rust disease systems don't have alternate hosts.
[04:43.160 --> 04:48.600]  We found this last year at the end of the growing season in October of 2019.
[04:48.600 --> 04:56.280]  We will be looking again this year for this so we can try to study it further.
[04:56.280 --> 05:01.480]  The following slide is a close up of what the pustule looks like on the under surface
[05:01.480 --> 05:03.880]  of the leaf and what is inside that pustule.
[05:03.880 --> 05:11.090]  These are urodinium spores of hemp rust.
[05:11.090 --> 05:15.570]  We do see other hemp leaf spots.
[05:15.570 --> 05:24.290]  I wanted to include a quick summary of those here.
[05:24.290 --> 05:27.250]  We see Cristiolaria zonate leaf spot.
[05:27.250 --> 05:29.810]  We see Cercospora leaf spot.
[05:30.010 --> 05:32.610]  We see some psyllium leaf spots.
[05:32.610 --> 05:37.690]  And we also see a number of other diseases that are not leaf spots.
[05:37.690 --> 05:45.690]  We see Fusarium bud blight which could have implications for quality of flowers and grain.
[05:45.690 --> 05:47.970]  We see Fusarium wilt.
[05:47.970 --> 05:49.890]  We see white molds.
[05:49.890 --> 05:51.450]  And we see Botrytis gray mold.
[05:51.450 --> 05:58.330]  So as you can see in addition to leaf spot diseases we do see and work on other diseases
[05:58.370 --> 06:03.000]  that are affecting hemp.
[06:03.000 --> 06:10.960]  So possible product treatments we are directing growers to go to the DEC, New York DEC webpage
[06:10.960 --> 06:15.080]  at this address and go to pesticide product information.
[06:15.080 --> 06:17.080]  Hit search.
[06:17.080 --> 06:20.800]  This will bring you to advanced search.
[06:20.800 --> 06:22.280]  You want to click that.
[06:22.280 --> 06:23.280]  Press search.
[06:23.280 --> 06:26.880]  Which will then bring you to pesticide use.
[06:26.880 --> 06:29.600]  You want to choose hemp industrial.
[06:30.280 --> 06:31.280]  Hit search.
[06:31.280 --> 06:33.280]  That will bring up about 98 products.
[06:33.280 --> 06:36.760]  Most of which are biologic in nature.
[06:36.760 --> 06:38.840]  Some bacillus type products.
[06:38.840 --> 06:43.040]  You want to check the labels on those to make sure hemp is included.
[06:43.040 --> 06:52.120]  All of this information again is present on the Cornell hemp webpage under the FAQ heading.
[06:52.120 --> 06:56.880]  In addition to the DEC webpage we want to use best agronomic practices.
[06:57.160 --> 07:01.200]  This will be second nature to seasoned growers and producers.
[07:01.200 --> 07:04.280]  But we want to start with prevention.
[07:04.280 --> 07:07.480]  With having reliable seed source and good soil health.
[07:07.480 --> 07:11.760]  It is a myth that hemp can be produced on marginal soils.
[07:11.760 --> 07:14.680]  We want fertile soil, well-drained soil.
[07:14.680 --> 07:20.440]  We want our plant spacing to be such where we are reducing the humidity between the plants
[07:20.440 --> 07:25.360]  because fungus really loves to be in humid places.
[07:25.360 --> 07:27.680]  It encourages its growth.
[07:27.680 --> 07:29.320]  Sanitation is very important.
[07:29.320 --> 07:32.320]  We want to remove debris offsite.
[07:32.320 --> 07:34.000]  You may burn it, you may compost it.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.760]  But we want it away from the hemp field.
[07:36.760 --> 07:38.720]  Weed control is also very important.
[07:38.720 --> 07:40.920]  We have noticed Cercospora growing on weeds.
[07:40.920 --> 07:44.480]  We have noticed Downy Mildew growing on weeds.
[07:44.480 --> 07:51.440]  Are those weeds vectors for fungal growth to the hemp or is it the other way around?
[07:51.440 --> 07:54.000]  We are still investigating that.
[07:54.040 --> 07:57.600]  But it is important to keep those weeds in control and out of the way.
[07:57.600 --> 08:01.440]  Crop rotation is also something to note.
[08:01.440 --> 08:06.200]  Edible beans, soybeans, sunflowers in their white molds.
[08:06.200 --> 08:10.480]  Probably not a great idea to follow hemp after those crops.
[08:10.480 --> 08:17.160]  Also in question recently, corn and cereal crops producing mycotoxins.
[08:17.160 --> 08:20.760]  Will it be wise to put hemp after those crops?
[08:20.800 --> 08:23.200]  And then resistant cultivars.
[08:23.200 --> 08:29.560]  Something that our program here at Cornell are working towards now.
[08:29.560 --> 08:37.040]  If you have questions about your hemp crop and have problems and want some diagnostics,
[08:37.040 --> 08:42.800]  it may be wise for you to contact your Cornell Cooperative Extension educator.
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.720]  If you don't know who yours is, you may go to the Cornell hemp page and find who your
[08:49.760 --> 08:53.200]  representative is.
[08:53.200 --> 08:59.240]  If you would like to submit samples to my lab, you may submit them through your Cornell
[08:59.240 --> 09:03.880]  Cooperative Extension educator through them to us.
[09:03.880 --> 09:08.840]  We may not give you the best turnaround time, but it will be of no charge to you.
[09:08.840 --> 09:14.040]  Or if you're looking for some quick results, you can use our plant disease diagnostic clinic
[09:14.040 --> 09:15.040]  at Cornell.
[09:15.040 --> 09:17.320]  And it is a fee for service.
[09:17.320 --> 09:18.680]  It's relatively low cost.
[09:18.680 --> 09:24.360]  I believe it's $30 to $35 if you're in state, $50 if you're out of state.
[09:24.360 --> 09:28.240]  And I've left the contact information for you here.
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.880]  Again, all of this information is on the Cornell team webpage.
[09:33.880 --> 09:37.280]  I'm going to leave you with our lab's contact information.
[09:37.280 --> 09:40.960]  This is Dr. Gary Bergstrom's email address.
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.880]  This is my email address and our laboratory phone number.
[09:44.880 --> 09:48.200]  If you have further questions after this talk today.
[09:48.200 --> 09:54.720]  Thanks for your time and I hope you enjoy the rest of Cornell's virtual hemp talks today.
