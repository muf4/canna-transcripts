[00:00.190 --> 00:07.480]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.840 --> 00:13.080]  All right everybody we're going to get our pest management section started. I'm
[00:13.080 --> 00:18.640]  going to be your first speaker. My name is Lynn Cisnoski and I am an assistant
[00:18.640 --> 00:24.400]  professor here at Cornell Agritech in Geneva in the horticulture section and
[00:24.400 --> 00:30.160]  I'm focused on weed management in specialty crops and this includes hemp.
[00:30.160 --> 00:36.440]  So I want to talk to you a little bit about hemp and and weed management and
[00:36.440 --> 00:42.560]  why it's such a problem and what kind of strategies we have in place currently
[00:42.560 --> 00:47.520]  and what we can expect to have in the near future.
[00:47.520 --> 00:55.360]  Okay is that better? Okay yeah. All right so I'm going to talk about weeds and weed
[00:55.360 --> 01:01.640]  management and hemp and I've heard from a lot of growers a lot of different CCE
[01:01.640 --> 01:07.320]  specialists that one of the limiting factors for hemp production is is weeds
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.040]  and the and the competition from weeds and that's in part because we don't have
[01:12.040 --> 01:18.920]  any registered synthetic herbicides for use in the commodity like we do in you
[01:18.920 --> 01:23.600]  know our agronomic systems or horticultural crops or ornamental crops.
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.200]  Now on the flip side of that and we'll talk about that in the second part of my
[01:28.200 --> 01:31.880]  talk is it's probably going to be a little bit hard to get some of those
[01:31.880 --> 01:36.680]  synthetic products because hemp is extremely sensitive to a lot of
[01:36.680 --> 01:42.440]  different active ingredients and modes of action. So I know you don't have the
[01:42.440 --> 01:47.640]  the paper handouts but I'm going to go over what's on mine today and talk a
[01:47.640 --> 01:51.440]  little bit about the research we're doing and just best management practices
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.880]  for weed control and then talk about the herbicide work that we're doing and
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.960]  then talk about the herbicide injury that we've seen. Okay so first and
[02:01.960 --> 02:09.960]  foremost we are actively involved in researching weeds weed control in hemp. I
[02:09.960 --> 02:15.440]  along with colleagues from North Dakota State University, Virginia Tech, Southern
[02:15.440 --> 02:22.200]  Illinois University and Clemson University received a USDA CPPM grant to
[02:22.200 --> 02:28.800]  look at hemp competitiveness with weeds and to evaluate different weed
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.240]  management strategies different cultural and physical weed management strategies
[02:33.240 --> 02:38.800]  as well as some chemical products. We are in the first year of our trial so I
[02:38.800 --> 02:44.880]  don't have data to share. I will have that for next year's hemp programs
[02:45.120 --> 02:51.080]  though. One thing I can tell you is that hemp is sensitive to weed competition.
[02:51.080 --> 02:55.360]  You know there's a lot going around saying that hemp is a competitive crop.
[02:55.360 --> 03:02.560]  You know that you know it's not going to need a lot of management of unwanted
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.720]  vegetation and certainly for the CBD hemp that is not true. We need to
[03:07.720 --> 03:13.920]  probably keep it at least weed free about four to six weeks to give it a
[03:13.920 --> 03:19.920]  chance to maximize yields. You know and that's a long
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.840]  time when you don't have a lot of tools available to you. Again preliminary work
[03:24.840 --> 03:34.320]  but right now that's what our data is showing. So we are a tag team. Yeah so if
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.880]  you want a little bit more information what I am talking about there's a QR code
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.320]  that you can scan and that's going to bring up the handouts. Actually I just
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.400]  tested it. It does not bring up the handout it brings up the website for
[03:47.400 --> 03:53.440]  this meeting and then you see Lynn Sosnowski and that's where you click on
[03:53.440 --> 03:56.960]  for the handout and then you get to the beautiful handout. And then you get
[03:56.960 --> 04:06.000]  there's two beautiful handouts there should be. Right so barring the
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.360]  availability of herbicides we got to really focus on integrated weed
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.200]  management and the first of two handouts that I I've provided through your QR
[04:16.200 --> 04:21.200]  code talk about integrated weed management and actually give you links
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.800]  to two very good integrated weed management sites. The one is called
[04:26.800 --> 04:32.800]  integratedweedmanagement.org that gives a bunch of information about you know
[04:32.800 --> 04:39.160]  basic best management practices and then the second is a website that links
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.520]  to a book that the late Chuck Muller from Cornell University put together. It
[04:43.520 --> 04:49.400]  is a free book through SARE. It is absolutely wonderful and it's manage
[04:49.400 --> 04:54.600]  weeds on your farm and ecological approach and I'm telling you you want to
[04:54.600 --> 05:00.000]  go and you want to download that PDF. It is perhaps one of the best free
[05:00.120 --> 05:06.040]  resources you are going to get for weed management. But to kind of summarize what
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.440]  both of those sites are saying when it comes to weed management and hemp first
[05:10.440 --> 05:16.680]  and foremost if you have the ability to choose your sites that you're going to
[05:16.680 --> 05:23.080]  plant your hemp crop into you definitely want to to do that. You want to choose
[05:23.080 --> 05:27.680]  your fields wisely so if you have fields that have perennial weeds like field
[05:27.720 --> 05:33.320]  bindweed like Canada thistle or you have very high weed densities if you have the
[05:33.320 --> 05:38.040]  ability to avoid those fields you want to avoid those fields because you want
[05:38.040 --> 05:43.560]  to start off with as low weed pressure as possible when you're putting a crop
[05:43.560 --> 05:48.160]  in that you don't have chemical control strategies. If you have the ability to
[05:48.160 --> 05:53.640]  adjust your planting date if you know you have a weed and you know it gets up
[05:53.640 --> 05:58.640]  early or it gets up late and you can adjust your planting date to either
[05:58.640 --> 06:03.360]  avoid that weed species or to give the hemp a competitive edge against that
[06:03.360 --> 06:10.120]  weed species consider changing your planting date. You can use stale seedbed
[06:10.120 --> 06:14.160]  practices and that's where you go in and you actually stimulate weed seeds to
[06:14.160 --> 06:18.720]  germinate in advance of your planting whether it's with irrigation whether
[06:18.720 --> 06:22.720]  it's with rainfall whether with it's a timely cultivation and then you go in
[06:22.760 --> 06:29.200]  and you destroy the weeds that get up to try and exhaust that initial seed bank.
[06:29.200 --> 06:35.360]  Choosing good seed quality and using appropriate seeding rates if you know
[06:35.360 --> 06:40.520]  that you know certain varieties have rapid and even germination getting a
[06:40.520 --> 06:46.120]  stand up evenly getting a stand up rapidly is going to be so important and
[06:46.120 --> 06:50.520]  that's going to actually play into my second part of my talk about herbicides.
[06:50.520 --> 06:55.120]  I did not have a good seed lot this year I didn't get even germination I
[06:55.120 --> 07:00.720]  didn't get a good stand I had a lot of weeds and not only that the poor stand
[07:00.720 --> 07:05.920]  quality the poor seed quality affected the hemp response to the herbicides and
[07:05.920 --> 07:11.920]  I saw a lot more injury than I expected to. With transplants, transplants help you
[07:11.920 --> 07:16.200]  maximize the height differential between the crops and the weeds and that is
[07:16.200 --> 07:19.160]  going to help improve the competitiveness so if you can put
[07:19.160 --> 07:23.080]  transplants in they're already up before your weeds get up and they can
[07:23.080 --> 07:28.240]  get established get over that transplant shock quickly get them established it's
[07:28.240 --> 07:33.920]  going to put you ahead. With cultivation where you are cultivating keeping your
[07:33.920 --> 07:38.880]  rows as straight as possible because that is going to improve your ability to
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.960]  get in tight with the row when it comes to cultivation events and it's going to
[07:42.960 --> 07:47.840]  reduce the potential for crop damage by if your row is waving and then you're
[07:47.840 --> 07:54.840]  going straight taking out plants with your cultivation. Plastic mulches
[07:54.840 --> 07:59.520]  managing the the weeds between the rows and in the planting holes is still
[07:59.520 --> 08:03.200]  really important we've got a trial out at the farm right now where we're
[08:03.200 --> 08:07.920]  managing weeds in the holes and we're just letting them go and we're seeing
[08:07.920 --> 08:11.640]  real differences even those few weeds that get up in the hole are enough to
[08:11.640 --> 08:17.480]  really compete with the hemp and then minimizing weed seed spread so this is
[08:17.600 --> 08:22.600]  just good cleanliness making sure if you're working in fields work your
[08:22.600 --> 08:27.080]  cleanest fields first don't go from an exceptionally weedy field and carry that
[08:27.080 --> 08:33.760]  mud or carry chaff or straw or whatever material into your cleanest field you
[08:33.760 --> 08:43.040]  know try try to always work cleanest to weediest. So we talked about integrated
[08:43.040 --> 08:46.840]  weed management strategies now we're just going to go into the herbicides
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.400]  because everybody does ask about herbicides when are we getting a
[08:50.400 --> 08:54.480]  herbicide when are we going to get a herbicide there is there are products
[08:54.480 --> 08:59.120]  moving through the EPA there are products moving through the IR4 project
[08:59.120 --> 09:06.840]  which is specializing in bringing chemical technology to specialty crops
[09:06.840 --> 09:13.920]  or low acreage crops so I have been told that Ethifluralin Sonalan should be
[09:13.920 --> 09:19.000]  coming on the market soon it's on the market it should be having hemp on its
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.600]  label soon it was in the spring it's now been pushed back to the fall so be on
[09:24.600 --> 09:30.920]  the lookout for Sonalan it is a group three so it's the same chemical family
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.560]  as trifluralin is the same chemical family as pentamethalin all right it
[09:35.560 --> 09:40.440]  tends to be a bit stronger on grasses than it is on broadleaves I am going to
[09:40.440 --> 09:45.080]  tell you I have seen some of the label language for Ethifluralin we did a
[09:45.080 --> 09:50.320]  bunch of work with pentamethalin this year prowl h2o and we got a lot of rain
[09:50.320 --> 09:56.520]  and we saw a lot of damage because we basically sort of flooded our fields if
[09:56.520 --> 10:00.080]  you're going to have a situation where you do have flooding or you're going to
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.160]  potentially be getting a lot of rain you're going to have the same potential
[10:04.160 --> 10:10.280]  issues with Ethifluralin which is going to be stem swelling and root damage but
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.920]  it is coming on the market there is another product a grass herbicide
[10:14.920 --> 10:22.000]  Quisalifop it goes under a sure to it is also on in trials and I believe
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.720]  Amvac is very interested in supporting this chemistry in hemp and then there's
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.440]  a lot of interest and more important than just researcher interest there's
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.920]  also I believe company interest in a product called Tupirilate it is a group
[10:40.040 --> 10:46.320]  27 HPPD inhibitor and there's work again going on through the IR4 project
[10:46.320 --> 10:51.360]  looking at Tupirilate now Tupirilate and a sure to are going to be further down
[10:51.360 --> 10:57.440]  the pipeline than Ethifluralin which we're anticipating very soon with
[10:57.440 --> 11:02.040]  respect to pre-emergence herbicides I did put in a couple of pre-emergent
[11:02.040 --> 11:07.540]  herbicides trials this year looking at a number of products at two different
[11:07.700 --> 11:11.420]  rates they expand a bunch of different chemical classes and I'm going to tell
[11:11.420 --> 11:17.460]  you it wasn't good hemp is really sensitive to a lot of herbicides and
[11:17.460 --> 11:22.340]  again I had a very poor seed lot and I think that kind of enhanced the damage I
[11:22.340 --> 11:27.320]  saw even the products that I was expecting to see a much more safety
[11:27.320 --> 11:33.340]  with such as Sandia which is halosulfuron or dual magnum which is
[11:33.340 --> 11:38.820]  as Montolachlor I still saw too much damage too much crop loss again I think
[11:38.820 --> 11:45.340]  due to the seed lot the other thing is we are looking at herbicides for use in
[11:45.340 --> 11:51.820]  transplanted hemp so it would be put down prior to transplanting and again
[11:51.820 --> 11:57.780]  saw more injury than I wanted to see had some really good weed control but too
[11:57.780 --> 12:02.980]  much crop stunting again we did have a lot of rainfall and that could have
[12:03.100 --> 12:07.340]  enhanced the results we saw another thing that we saw it's not just what
[12:07.340 --> 12:11.660]  happens with the root zone when we're talking these pre-emergent herbicides we
[12:11.660 --> 12:17.260]  transplanted and we had a driving rain and driving wind and we had our hemp
[12:17.260 --> 12:22.900]  transplants touch the ground where we had just put our herbicides down and we
[12:22.900 --> 12:28.380]  burned a lot of hemp you know that we weren't anticipating you know 40 mile an
[12:28.380 --> 12:32.820]  hour winds to come through so understand that some of these products in addition
[12:32.820 --> 12:36.980]  to potentially causing root damage if you have transplants and they get
[12:36.980 --> 12:42.660]  wilted or you have those driving rains those driving winds and you get the the
[12:42.660 --> 12:49.060]  leaf contact with the soil surface you can also have injury I'm not going to go
[12:49.060 --> 12:54.380]  into it but I talked that hemp is really sensitive to a bunch of herbicides the
[12:54.380 --> 12:59.340]  second handout is actually hemp responses to some post-emergence
[12:59.340 --> 13:04.060]  herbicides so in the case of drift events I actually have gotten a lot of
[13:04.060 --> 13:08.660]  drift calls is this herbicide injury is this herbicide injury is this herbicide
[13:08.660 --> 13:15.020]  injury and so things like dicamba 2,4-D glyphosate some of the other products
[13:15.020 --> 13:19.020]  and so I've just put some pictures and talked a little bit about the modes of
[13:19.020 --> 13:23.900]  action and the kinds of symptomology that you can expect to see I am working
[13:23.900 --> 13:29.740]  currently on a herbicide injury website that's going to go up at Cornell cows
[13:29.740 --> 13:34.180]  this fall and it will have a lot of hemp pictures in it because hemp again it's
[13:34.180 --> 13:38.740]  really sensitive to a lot of herbicides and that is my talk and I'm going to
[13:38.740 --> 13:43.100]  pass it off to Chris unless you've got questions.
[13:44.540 --> 13:52.180]  Question. I think the lack of herbicides now is kind of an opportunity for us to
[13:52.180 --> 13:57.220]  really get good at things like mechanical cultivation so can you tell
[13:57.220 --> 14:05.220]  me what your experience with hemp is in mechanical cultivation is it sensitive to its root level and mechanical stuff?
[14:05.220 --> 14:10.740]  So I've worked with transplanted hemp and cultivation and I have not seen
[14:10.740 --> 14:16.620]  sensitivity to the cultivation event itself my problem is is that the
[14:16.620 --> 14:22.060]  cultivation not getting between the hemp plants well enough and still leaving
[14:22.060 --> 14:27.980]  too many with the cultivation system that we are studying still leaving too
[14:27.980 --> 14:34.140]  many too many weeds present and and still allowing for too much competition
[14:34.140 --> 14:40.620]  the I did not have the cultivator that I wanted because of supply chain issues
[14:40.620 --> 14:46.700]  but we now have it so now I do have a actually a vision guided cultivator that
[14:46.700 --> 14:51.060]  follows the rows much better has some better implements on it that I think is
[14:51.060 --> 14:59.460]  going to get us a lot closer than what we were using yeah we're we're still
[14:59.460 --> 15:08.760]  looking at a fairly shallow depth like an inch yes
[15:08.760 --> 15:16.880]  So since hemp is so sensitive to herbicides, if you already have weeds established, what do you recommend to do?
[15:16.880 --> 15:21.640]  Well it's going to depend what hemp you're growing if you've got the ability
[15:21.640 --> 15:28.080]  to cultivate using cultivation it's also going to very much depend on you
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.560]  know maybe a high value you know a CBD hemp where you can get in there and
[15:32.560 --> 15:38.160]  invest in hand weeding you know it's a lot of time it's a lot of effort and
[15:38.160 --> 15:43.520]  it's a lot of money but yeah we don't we don't have a lot of strategies there is
[15:43.520 --> 15:47.880]  some work that has been done out at Nebraska looking at flame weeding
[15:47.920 --> 15:53.600]  Steve Knezovic has got some information online about flame weeders again we were
[15:53.600 --> 15:57.680]  supposed to do flame weeding but because of supply chain issues I do not have my
[15:57.680 --> 16:03.440]  flame weeder it is still coming so we are going to be investigating flame
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.400]  weeding next summer we do have our new cultivator so we're going to have a much
[16:07.400 --> 16:15.280]  better ability to get a lot closer to the crop and again also I have I've got
[16:15.280 --> 16:20.840]  some more tools coming it's just COVID delays has is playing into a couple of
[16:20.840 --> 16:34.760]  years like plastic yeah oh yeah so we're using weed cloth oh he asked about weed
[16:34.760 --> 16:38.920]  cloth so she had asked the question what if you already have weeds up in the
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.680]  ground yeah so finding really good control with the plastic or the weed
[16:43.760 --> 16:49.240]  cloth but we are finding that you've got to still be very actively managing in
[16:49.240 --> 16:54.640]  the holes it takes a lot less effort maybe to do those plants but letting
[16:54.640 --> 16:58.840]  those plants go we're still seeing significant yield loss if we don't go in
[16:58.840 --> 17:02.520]  there and control the weeds that are coming up through the planting hole in
[17:02.520 --> 17:16.970]  the plastic thank you Lynn this has been a production of Cornell University on
