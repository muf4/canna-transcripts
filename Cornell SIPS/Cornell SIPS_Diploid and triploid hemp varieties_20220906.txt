[00:00.000 --> 00:07.610]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:07.610 --> 00:11.610]  OK, so I'm going to be talking about our diploid and triploid
[00:11.610 --> 00:13.290]  hemp cultivar trials that we've been
[00:13.290 --> 00:14.550]  doing these past two years.
[00:14.550 --> 00:16.230]  If you were here last year, then you
[00:16.230 --> 00:18.890]  got to see year one in the field.
[00:18.890 --> 00:23.290]  And then this is our year two trial in these first two rows
[00:23.290 --> 00:24.530]  here.
[00:24.530 --> 00:26.410]  So let's just kind of go over some basics.
[00:26.410 --> 00:29.970]  What is the difference between a diploid hemp cultivar
[00:29.970 --> 00:31.770]  and a triploid hemp cultivar?
[00:31.810 --> 00:34.010]  Well, it's the number of sets of chromosomes
[00:34.010 --> 00:35.210]  that the plant has.
[00:35.210 --> 00:39.330]  So most hemp, just like humans, has two sets of chromosomes,
[00:39.330 --> 00:41.730]  one that they get from their pollen parent from their dad
[00:41.730 --> 00:44.770]  and one that they get from their seed parent from their mom.
[00:44.770 --> 00:49.370]  But there's kind of some fancy chemical manipulation
[00:49.370 --> 00:52.970]  that we can do that we can make a different number
[00:52.970 --> 00:55.170]  of chromosomes in the plant.
[00:55.170 --> 00:57.730]  So this is something that Oregon CBD did.
[00:57.730 --> 00:59.490]  If you look at the handout, which
[00:59.490 --> 01:04.570]  you can find on the QR code on the agenda for the day,
[01:04.570 --> 01:06.850]  you can see that what they did is they treated
[01:06.850 --> 01:09.990]  some of their individuals with a chemical called
[01:09.990 --> 01:13.450]  colchicine, which doubles the number of chromosomes.
[01:13.450 --> 01:16.290]  So instead of being a diploid, two sets of chromosomes,
[01:16.290 --> 01:19.930]  they become a tetraploid, four sets of chromosomes.
[01:19.930 --> 01:22.650]  And then when you cross a tetraploid, 4x,
[01:22.650 --> 01:26.770]  with a diploid, 2x, you get a triploid, 3x.
[01:26.770 --> 01:28.450]  Does that make sense, everyone?
[01:28.450 --> 01:29.370]  You track it perfectly.
[01:29.370 --> 01:30.530]  Great.
[01:30.530 --> 01:33.250]  So the next question, why would we even want triploids?
[01:33.250 --> 01:35.330]  Like, what is the value of triploids?
[01:35.330 --> 01:37.290]  And I'm going to give you a hint.
[01:37.290 --> 01:40.630]  Things like seedless watermelon and bananas
[01:40.630 --> 01:44.890]  are also triploid, naturally or man-made.
[01:44.890 --> 01:48.610]  And the benefit in some species of being triploid
[01:48.610 --> 01:51.610]  is that they do not usually produce viable seeds.
[01:51.610 --> 01:53.970]  So when seeds are produced in the plant,
[01:53.970 --> 01:56.610]  the plant needs to divide up the chromosomes
[01:56.610 --> 02:00.130]  into different seeds that then get pollinated by pollen.
[02:00.130 --> 02:03.290]  But you can imagine that dividing three sets of chromosomes
[02:03.290 --> 02:05.610]  does not go as well as dividing two or four,
[02:05.610 --> 02:07.930]  because three doesn't divide evenly.
[02:07.930 --> 02:10.790]  So it's much harder for these plants to make seed.
[02:10.790 --> 02:14.650]  And often, the triploids are seedless, are sterile.
[02:14.650 --> 02:17.810]  So people were interested in this from a hemp perspective,
[02:17.810 --> 02:19.690]  because if you're producing cannabinoids,
[02:19.690 --> 02:23.350]  you want un-pollinated female inflorescences.
[02:23.350 --> 02:24.990]  So pollen management is something
[02:24.990 --> 02:26.950]  that a lot of growers have to deal with,
[02:26.950 --> 02:30.270]  something that drives people to do indoor cultivation,
[02:30.270 --> 02:33.830]  to really need to manage the production of males
[02:33.830 --> 02:36.990]  in their field, and also grain and fiber production
[02:36.990 --> 02:40.390]  in a several-mile radius, because hemp and cannabis is
[02:40.390 --> 02:43.590]  wind-pollinated, and that pollen can travel really great
[02:43.590 --> 02:45.670]  distances.
[02:45.670 --> 02:49.190]  So the idea was that if we could have these triploid cultivars,
[02:49.190 --> 02:50.430]  they would be seedless.
[02:50.430 --> 02:52.630]  You could grow them without the fear of pollination.
[02:52.630 --> 02:56.510]  And to test that, us, along with our colleagues
[02:56.510 --> 02:59.390]  at North Carolina State and the University of Kentucky,
[02:59.390 --> 03:01.430]  decided to do a trial where we planted
[03:01.430 --> 03:03.950]  these diploid and triploid cultivars at sites
[03:03.950 --> 03:06.190]  that were pollen-free, and also sites
[03:06.190 --> 03:07.310]  that were pollen-challenged.
[03:07.310 --> 03:08.890]  So this is our pollen-challenged site.
[03:08.890 --> 03:11.310]  You can see our grain and fiber planting right behind it.
[03:11.310 --> 03:13.030]  There's a ton of pollen there.
[03:13.030 --> 03:15.790]  So if these plants were going to get pollinated,
[03:15.790 --> 03:17.790]  we're giving them the best opportunity
[03:17.790 --> 03:19.990]  to get pollinated here.
[03:19.990 --> 03:21.870]  So we were interested in comparing the diploid
[03:21.910 --> 03:24.630]  and triploid cultivars at our pollinated and pollen-free
[03:24.630 --> 03:25.310]  sites.
[03:25.310 --> 03:27.790]  And if you look on our handout, I'm
[03:27.790 --> 03:31.510]  presenting some of the data from our sites last year.
[03:31.510 --> 03:35.030]  Really, really exciting and interesting data.
[03:35.030 --> 03:39.750]  So the diploids produce seed, as expected.
[03:39.750 --> 03:42.070]  Interestingly, the triploids also
[03:42.070 --> 03:47.630]  produced some seed, dramatically less seed, but some seed still.
[03:47.630 --> 03:49.950]  So as a proportion of the total biomass,
[03:49.950 --> 03:54.030]  our diploids produced 40% or 50% of the total biomass
[03:54.030 --> 03:55.990]  with seed, whereas our triploids,
[03:55.990 --> 03:59.070]  it was generally less than 10%, as low as 1%,
[03:59.070 --> 04:01.190]  even in a pollinated environment.
[04:01.190 --> 04:04.150]  So a pretty dramatic reduction in seed.
[04:04.150 --> 04:08.710]  And that also corresponds with the cannabinoid measurements.
[04:08.710 --> 04:10.910]  So we measured cannabinoids at three weeks
[04:10.910 --> 04:12.550]  after the initiation of flowering,
[04:12.550 --> 04:14.430]  five weeks after the initiation of flowering,
[04:14.430 --> 04:17.310]  and also bulk-stripped floral biomass.
[04:17.310 --> 04:21.710]  And for our diploid varieties, we
[04:21.710 --> 04:24.710]  saw significant reductions in cannabinoid content
[04:24.710 --> 04:25.790]  at our pollinated sites.
[04:25.790 --> 04:29.630]  So more seed, less cannabinoids, probably a combination
[04:29.630 --> 04:32.950]  of things like the total biomass being diluted
[04:32.950 --> 04:35.550]  by seed biomass, which is very low in cannabinoids
[04:35.550 --> 04:37.910]  because the cannabinoids are not produced in the seeds.
[04:37.910 --> 04:40.790]  But if we look at our triploids, at our pollinated
[04:40.790 --> 04:42.270]  and pollen-free environments, they
[04:42.270 --> 04:44.310]  produced about the same amount of cannabinoids.
[04:44.310 --> 04:46.030]  So we didn't see that dilution effect,
[04:46.030 --> 04:48.910]  even though there was a little bit of seed production.
[04:48.910 --> 04:51.910]  So I think that's all I really want to say.
[04:51.910 --> 04:53.590]  You can see more on the handout.
[04:53.590 --> 04:56.590]  And I would be happy to take any questions.
[04:56.590 --> 04:58.870]  Or we can walk around for a minute or two
[04:58.870 --> 05:01.590]  before we have to go to Luis and Jamie's talk
[05:01.590 --> 05:03.110]  right across the street here.
[05:03.110 --> 05:04.270]  Larry has a question.
[05:04.270 --> 05:06.150]  Why are those plants so small?
[05:06.150 --> 05:07.790]  Oh, that's a great question, Larry.
[05:07.790 --> 05:10.270]  The question from Larry is, why are those plants so small?
[05:10.270 --> 05:12.430]  If you were here last year, you may
[05:12.430 --> 05:15.070]  remember that the plants were much bigger last year.
[05:15.070 --> 05:20.150]  And this was because these are transplanted hemp plants.
[05:20.150 --> 05:21.670]  So we grew them in the greenhouse.
[05:21.670 --> 05:23.470]  And you know you grow them in the greenhouse
[05:23.470 --> 05:25.310]  with the anticipation that your field is
[05:25.310 --> 05:26.830]  going to be ready when the plants are
[05:26.830 --> 05:27.950]  ready in the greenhouse.
[05:27.950 --> 05:30.150]  Unfortunately, we had a very wet June.
[05:30.150 --> 05:32.670]  And this field did not have plastic.
[05:32.670 --> 05:33.630]  It was not plowed up.
[05:33.630 --> 05:35.310]  We couldn't get the tractors in here.
[05:35.310 --> 05:39.110]  So we weren't able to transplant that initial set of plants
[05:39.110 --> 05:41.750]  that would have been probably this big by now.
[05:41.750 --> 05:44.830]  So what we did is we planted a second round of seedlings,
[05:44.830 --> 05:46.270]  which were delayed about a month.
[05:46.270 --> 05:47.110]  And these are those.
[05:47.110 --> 05:50.430]  So they're significantly smaller than one would expect.
[05:50.430 --> 05:53.590]  But we should be able to get still good data off of them,
[05:53.590 --> 05:55.790]  even though the plants are smaller.
[05:55.790 --> 05:56.910]  Any other questions?
[05:56.910 --> 05:57.750]  Yes, Tyler.
[05:57.750 --> 05:58.990]  Yeah, I'm just curious.
[05:58.990 --> 06:01.750]  Are all of these plants triploid out here
[06:01.750 --> 06:02.950]  that we're going to look at?
[06:02.950 --> 06:05.550]  Or do you have some comparison, like diploid first?
[06:05.550 --> 06:07.750]  That's a great, great question, Tyler.
[06:07.750 --> 06:10.710]  So Tyler asked if all of the plants are diploid,
[06:10.710 --> 06:12.110]  or all of the plants are triploid,
[06:12.110 --> 06:13.510]  or if there's mixtures.
[06:13.510 --> 06:15.470]  So the diploid triploid trial is actually
[06:15.470 --> 06:17.910]  just a very small portion of this field.
[06:17.910 --> 06:19.270]  We have a lot of other exciting stuff
[06:19.270 --> 06:21.990]  that I don't get to talk about in the rest of the field.
[06:21.990 --> 06:25.110]  So these first two rows are the diploid triploid trial.
[06:25.110 --> 06:28.870]  And we have three pairs of diploid and triploid cultivars.
[06:28.870 --> 06:31.310]  So three diploids and three triploids.
[06:31.310 --> 06:34.830]  And they're replicated in five plant plots four times.
[06:34.830 --> 06:37.470]  So there are both diploids and triploids in the field.
[06:37.470 --> 06:38.310]  Yes.
[06:41.830 --> 06:42.910]  Any other questions?
[06:42.910 --> 06:44.550]  Yes.
[06:44.550 --> 06:46.030]  What's the effect of the triploidy
[06:46.030 --> 06:49.870]  on the vegetative growth or other aspects of the plant growth?
[06:49.870 --> 06:50.990]  That's a great question.
[06:50.990 --> 06:54.190]  So the question was, does being triploid
[06:54.190 --> 06:58.230]  compared to being diploid increase maybe the biomass
[06:58.230 --> 07:00.550]  or the concentration of cannabinoids?
[07:00.550 --> 07:02.550]  So based on the data from last year,
[07:02.550 --> 07:06.350]  I don't think we saw evidence of that.
[07:06.350 --> 07:08.670]  In the pollinated trials, obviously,
[07:08.670 --> 07:12.710]  the diploids produce seed and the triploids did not.
[07:13.510 --> 07:15.550]  So there was a difference in concentration there.
[07:15.550 --> 07:18.310]  But overall, I don't think we see an effect of triploids
[07:18.310 --> 07:23.430]  being larger than diploids or producing 50% more cannabinoids
[07:23.430 --> 07:24.870]  in an un-pollinated field.
[07:28.480 --> 07:29.320]  Yes, Tyler.
[07:29.320 --> 07:32.760]  Have you worked at all, you mentioned tetraploids as well.
[07:32.760 --> 07:35.920]  Have you tried to grow any tetraploids here?
[07:35.920 --> 07:39.760]  So Tyler's asking if we have grown any tetraploids here.
[07:39.760 --> 07:44.000]  And to my knowledge, we have not grown any tetraploids here.
[07:44.320 --> 07:45.640]  So that's really interesting to do.
[07:45.640 --> 07:48.360]  But our lab has not gotten into the whole
[07:48.360 --> 07:50.560]  colchicine chromosome doubling deal.
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.600]  We're mostly relying on other people who have done that work
[07:54.600 --> 07:56.400]  and we're just evaluating those.
[07:57.480 --> 07:59.720]  Alrighty, so we got...
[07:59.720 --> 08:01.280]  It is a good question though,
[08:02.400 --> 08:05.440]  whether triploidy and fiber hemp, for example,
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.520]  might increase the yield.
[08:07.520 --> 08:10.520]  You would have to create it as an F1 hybrid, obviously,
[08:10.520 --> 08:12.240]  because it wouldn't make any seed.
[08:12.360 --> 08:13.200]  But...
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.560]  Do you have to plant it as a clone then?
[08:14.560 --> 08:18.280]  No, no, you would cross a diploid with a tetraploid
[08:19.760 --> 08:22.040]  and that would create the triploid seed.
[08:22.040 --> 08:24.240]  And then you just take that seed and plant that seed.
[08:24.240 --> 08:27.280]  But obviously those plants are then sterile.
[08:27.280 --> 08:30.880]  So you have to do that hybrid cross every year
[08:30.880 --> 08:33.960]  to make that seed, potentially.
[08:33.960 --> 08:36.080]  Yeah, so that's a great point that Larry's making about
[08:36.080 --> 08:38.080]  there could be applications for triploids
[08:38.080 --> 08:40.840]  in other market classes of hemp, including fiber hemp,
[08:41.680 --> 08:44.480]  depending on what the effect of the extra set of chromosomes
[08:44.480 --> 08:46.800]  does on the other traits in the plant.
[08:46.800 --> 08:49.920]  And the possible benefit for fiber would be what?
[08:50.840 --> 08:53.960]  Often triploids show increased yield.
[08:53.960 --> 08:55.480]  They're bigger than diploids.
[08:55.480 --> 08:56.320]  Right.
[08:56.320 --> 08:58.800]  So we've done a lot of work on willow.
[08:58.800 --> 09:00.960]  Most of our commercial willow cultivars,
[09:00.960 --> 09:03.760]  which are for biomass production, are triploids.
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.280]  Is there any work on hybrid vigor with hemp?
[09:11.800 --> 09:13.000]  So the question was,
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.520]  is there any work on hybrid vigor for hemp?
[09:15.520 --> 09:17.120]  So just a background for those of you
[09:17.120 --> 09:19.400]  unfamiliar with hybrid vigor.
[09:19.400 --> 09:22.760]  In other crops, the canonical system used to make hybrids
[09:22.760 --> 09:24.360]  is you generate two inbred lines.
[09:24.360 --> 09:26.080]  I'll just use corn as an example.
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.000]  So you can take two very different corn lines.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.280]  You can self them until they're very inbred,
[09:33.280 --> 09:35.120]  and then you can use them to make a hybrid.
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.600]  And then that hybrid shows hybrid vigor or heterosis.
[09:38.600 --> 09:40.920]  So the progeny perform much better
[09:40.920 --> 09:42.360]  than both of the parents.
[09:43.200 --> 09:45.720]  So this is much more challenging to do in hemp
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.320]  because hemp is generally outcrossing.
[09:48.320 --> 09:50.720]  If it's dioecious, it's an obligate outcrosser.
[09:50.720 --> 09:53.320]  So it's much harder to make inbred lines.
[09:54.200 --> 09:57.600]  There is some work on it from groups like Oregon CBD.
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.640]  Also, our group published a paper last year
[10:01.640 --> 10:05.640]  looking at different hybrid families of hemp
[10:05.640 --> 10:07.680]  all crossed to a single common parent
[10:07.680 --> 10:10.320]  and how those different hybrids performed.
[10:10.320 --> 10:12.800]  So there definitely is work on it,
[10:12.800 --> 10:15.120]  but it is more challenging in a dioecious species
[10:15.120 --> 10:17.440]  than a normal selfing species.
[10:18.800 --> 10:19.640]  Yep.
[10:19.640 --> 10:21.800]  Are you noticing any differences in the flower structure
[10:21.800 --> 10:24.040]  when you increase ploidy?
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.960]  So the question was, are there any differences
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.680]  in flower structure with an increase in ploidy?
[10:29.680 --> 10:32.800]  I personally have not noticed that,
[10:32.800 --> 10:33.960]  but that's also anecdotal.
[10:33.960 --> 10:37.640]  I don't know if people have done
[10:37.640 --> 10:39.800]  inflorescence architecture quantification
[10:39.800 --> 10:42.360]  and done proper statistics to test that hypothesis,
[10:42.360 --> 10:45.960]  but it would be definitely an interesting hypothesis to test.
[10:45.960 --> 10:48.880]  They do flower later though, right?
[10:48.880 --> 10:51.960]  So in these diploid, triploid comparisons,
[10:51.960 --> 10:54.680]  we do see that the triploids generally flower later,
[10:55.560 --> 10:58.800]  which could be an effect of being triploid.
[10:58.800 --> 11:01.640]  It also could be a fact of flowering time genes
[11:01.640 --> 11:03.680]  that are segregating in these populations.
[11:04.360 --> 11:07.000]  So when Oregon CBD makes their hybrids,
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.080]  they use an auto flower parent as their pollen parent.
[11:10.080 --> 11:12.720]  So they can, well, for a variety of reasons,
[11:12.720 --> 11:17.720]  but that is one of the things that is just innately part
[11:18.160 --> 11:19.400]  of all of their hybrids.
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.240]  So in diploids, the hybrids have one dose out of two
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.960]  from that auto flower parent,
[11:26.960 --> 11:30.320]  but in triploids, it's one dose out of three.
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.240]  So if this flowering time is dosage dependent,
[11:33.800 --> 11:36.440]  it could be an effect of the genes in addition
[11:36.440 --> 11:37.360]  to the ploidy.
[11:41.730 --> 11:43.770]  Alrighty, I think we're running out of time here,
[11:43.770 --> 11:47.930]  but I'll be around if anybody has any questions
[11:47.930 --> 11:50.570]  and I'm excited to hear what Luis and Jamie
[11:50.570 --> 11:52.410]  have to talk about at the next stop.
[11:58.080 --> 12:01.520]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[12:01.520 --> 12:04.360]  on the web at cornell.edu.
