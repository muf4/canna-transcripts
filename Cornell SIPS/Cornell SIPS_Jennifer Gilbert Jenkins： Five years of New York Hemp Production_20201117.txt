[00:00.700 --> 00:03.700]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:06.700 --> 00:09.700]  All right, I'm setting my timer for 30 minutes
[00:09.700 --> 00:13.700]  so that I'm sure that I have enough time for us
[00:13.700 --> 00:19.700]  to chat afterwards and we'll see how quickly I flow through.
[00:19.700 --> 00:24.700]  So when I sat back to think about what we would talk about
[00:24.700 --> 00:30.700]  today, I realized that the past five years have been
[00:30.700 --> 00:32.700]  sort of a stream of consciousness.
[00:32.700 --> 00:36.700]  We keep trying new things and spreading out and branching.
[00:36.700 --> 00:43.700]  And my goal for the day is to take you on this journey
[00:43.700 --> 00:45.700]  with us that we've gone on.
[00:45.700 --> 00:48.700]  And at any point, if you have a question,
[00:48.700 --> 00:52.700]  feel free to throw it in the chat so that you don't forget it.
[00:52.700 --> 00:55.700]  And then maybe we can talk about it at the end.
[00:55.700 --> 00:58.700]  But if you need clarification, if I'm going too fast,
[00:58.700 --> 01:02.700]  if I'm using an acronym that isn't familiar to everybody,
[01:02.700 --> 01:07.700]  then by all means, feel free to shout out and stop me
[01:07.700 --> 01:09.700]  as I'm going.
[01:09.700 --> 01:11.700]  I'm going to share my screen.
[01:11.700 --> 01:15.700]  This is essentially going to be storytelling time
[01:15.700 --> 01:18.700]  for all intents and purposes.
[01:18.700 --> 01:21.700]  I'm going to throw a whole lot of pictures at you
[01:21.700 --> 01:26.700]  and just describe what we've learned as we've went along.
[01:26.700 --> 01:31.700]  I haven't been involved with a lot of the horticultural
[01:31.700 --> 01:35.700]  production until really, I would say, this past year.
[01:35.700 --> 01:37.700]  That's more my colleague Kelly Hennigan.
[01:37.700 --> 01:40.700]  But we work as a team.
[01:40.700 --> 01:44.700]  And so I'll let you know a bit about what we've done
[01:44.700 --> 01:46.700]  and where we've come.
[01:47.700 --> 01:49.700]  Let's begin.
[01:49.700 --> 01:50.700]  All right.
[01:50.700 --> 01:53.700]  Let's see if my computer will cooperate with us.
[01:53.700 --> 01:55.700]  There we go.
[01:55.700 --> 01:58.700]  When I first went to write this presentation,
[01:58.700 --> 02:01.700]  I set up the slides for each of the years.
[02:01.700 --> 02:05.700]  And I realized about 15 minutes into it that I was off by 20 years
[02:05.700 --> 02:11.700]  and I had written 1996, 1997, 98, 99, and 2000.
[02:11.700 --> 02:14.700]  So apparently I'm stuck in the 1990s.
[02:15.700 --> 02:17.700]  But then I fixed it and realized, no, no,
[02:17.700 --> 02:20.700]  we started growing in 2016, not 1996.
[02:20.700 --> 02:22.700]  So that was our inaugural hemp crop.
[02:22.700 --> 02:26.700]  And we were partners with JD Farm.
[02:26.700 --> 02:30.700]  And at their farm, we grew 30 acres.
[02:30.700 --> 02:32.700]  So our goal was really,
[02:32.700 --> 02:36.700]  we thought that grain was going to be the low-hanging fruit.
[02:36.700 --> 02:39.700]  So we were going to focus on grain production.
[02:39.700 --> 02:42.700]  We said we don't really know so much about grain production when it
[02:43.700 --> 02:47.700]  comes to an organic farm and JD Farm is an organic farm.
[02:47.700 --> 02:52.700]  So our research focus was looking at can we meet the nutrient
[02:52.700 --> 02:57.700]  requirements for this crop using different combinations of manures.
[02:57.700 --> 03:02.700]  And we figured we would just compare yield between them as our first go
[03:02.700 --> 03:08.700]  and see how we did.
[03:09.700 --> 03:10.700]  So we did that.
[03:10.700 --> 03:13.700]  And it was the craziest year for importing seed.
[03:13.700 --> 03:16.700]  It was the first time around. We had no idea what we were doing.
[03:16.700 --> 03:21.700]  Getting the seed took way longer than we thought it was going to.
[03:21.700 --> 03:24.700]  The shipping company, when they figured out what they were shipping.
[03:24.700 --> 03:27.700]  So they, they, we ordered our seed from Canada.
[03:27.700 --> 03:32.700]  And it almost made it to us. It made it to Syracuse.
[03:32.700 --> 03:35.700]  And then the shipping company realized what they were shipping and
[03:35.700 --> 03:38.700]  wouldn't take it a foot further.
[03:38.700 --> 03:43.700]  And so I had to drive to Syracuse with police escort
[03:44.700 --> 03:48.700]  to pick up the seed, sign for it and, and drive it back.
[03:48.700 --> 03:52.700]  And then we had to have police watch
[03:53.700 --> 03:58.700]  the seed so that none of it was stolen between the time when we
[03:59.700 --> 04:02.700]  purchased or received it until the time it got in the ground.
[04:02.700 --> 04:05.700]  And so that was crazy.
[04:05.700 --> 04:08.700]  So we didn't get planted until July 4th.
[04:08.700 --> 04:11.700]  So year one was what we thought was a late start.
[04:11.700 --> 04:16.700]  We didn't get planted until July 4th and we hired a local grain farmer
[04:17.700 --> 04:20.700]  to custom harvest for us. We had no idea what we were doing.
[04:20.700 --> 04:22.700]  It was a really steep learning curve.
[04:22.700 --> 04:24.700]  They had no idea what they were doing.
[04:24.700 --> 04:26.700]  So we figured let's all learn together.
[04:26.700 --> 04:29.700]  And being the,
[04:29.700 --> 04:32.700]  the first crop everybody wanted to get in on pictures.
[04:32.700 --> 04:34.700]  So even though we planted with
[04:34.700 --> 04:39.700]  laser pointer, we planted with a green drill, as you can see here.
[04:40.700 --> 04:46.700]  This is Dan Dolgen and Mark Just from JD Farm.
[04:46.700 --> 04:49.700]  They, and we were all planted a few, this is me and my kids.
[04:49.700 --> 04:51.700]  We all planted a few seeds by hand.
[04:51.700 --> 04:54.700]  This was the truck we had to haul.
[04:54.700 --> 04:56.700]  And the police escorted back.
[04:56.700 --> 04:58.700]  So it was quite an exciting time.
[04:58.700 --> 05:01.700]  And even though our research question was all about nutrients,
[05:01.700 --> 05:03.700]  we learned a little bit about pest pressure.
[05:03.700 --> 05:07.700]  And that first year we learned a whole lot about weeds.
[05:07.700 --> 05:08.700]  And that,
[05:08.700 --> 05:12.700]  although we were hearing lots of people in the surrounding communities
[05:12.700 --> 05:15.700]  talk about the fact that the pest pressure is so high,
[05:15.700 --> 05:17.700]  that it's not just a problem with the environment,
[05:17.700 --> 05:19.700]  but it's a problem with the environment.
[05:19.700 --> 05:21.700]  And so we were able to learn a lot about that.
[05:21.700 --> 05:24.700]  And then we were able to hear a lot of people in the surrounding
[05:24.700 --> 05:25.700]  communities talk about.
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.700]  They were concerned.
[05:27.700 --> 05:30.700]  And this Sativa would become the next.
[05:30.700 --> 05:36.700]  Major field crop weed.
[05:36.700 --> 05:40.700]  But we were learning was that this plant cannot out-compete our
[05:40.700 --> 05:44.700]  weed species.
[05:44.700 --> 05:48.700]  We had heard horror stories from Kentucky about how devastating
[05:48.700 --> 05:49.700]  the weed species were.
[05:49.700 --> 05:51.700]  And so we were able to learn a lot about that.
[05:51.700 --> 05:54.700]  And then we were able to see some Japanese beetles on our plants.
[05:54.700 --> 05:55.700]  But what we realized.
[05:55.700 --> 05:57.700]  Was that they were mostly.
[05:57.700 --> 05:59.700]  Hanging out on the male flowers.
[05:59.700 --> 06:10.700]  And.
[06:10.700 --> 06:11.700]  A little bit,
[06:11.700 --> 06:14.700]  the weed species in the field were acting as trap crops because they
[06:14.700 --> 06:17.700]  were preferring being on the pigweed around the hemp than they were on
[06:17.700 --> 06:18.700]  the hemp.
[06:18.700 --> 06:20.700]  And so we were able to learn a lot about.
[06:20.700 --> 06:23.700]  What it meant for this crop to be indeterminate.
[06:23.700 --> 06:28.700]  And the fact that we have.
[06:28.700 --> 06:33.700]  Our seeds maturing unevenly throughout the plant.
[06:33.700 --> 06:36.700]  This first year we had so many people want to come visit the fields.
[06:36.700 --> 06:45.700]  And take pictures. I think everybody.
[06:46.700 --> 06:50.700]  Right. And so here we can see the unevenness of grain production.
[06:50.700 --> 06:51.700]  We're up the top here.
[06:51.700 --> 06:55.700]  You could see the seeds are brown and drying out and.
[06:55.700 --> 06:58.700]  And at the bottom, right. They're still green.
[06:58.700 --> 06:59.700]  And the.
[06:59.700 --> 07:04.700]  The first year was, oh, well.
[07:04.700 --> 07:06.700]  If we're going to treat this like other grain crops,
[07:06.700 --> 07:09.700]  when we harvest our other grain crops, we wait for the seed to dry out.
[07:09.700 --> 07:12.700]  So we were waiting for our seed to dry before we came through and
[07:12.700 --> 07:13.700]  harvest it.
[07:13.700 --> 07:15.700]  And so we were able to see that the seed was dry.
[07:15.700 --> 07:16.700]  And then we were able to harvest it.
[07:16.700 --> 07:18.700]  And then another piece of this.
[07:18.700 --> 07:26.700]  You can see the lambs quarter here along the side and next to it.
[07:26.700 --> 07:30.700]  That is easily as tall as the hemp plants that were in this field.
[07:30.700 --> 07:33.700]  So.
[07:33.700 --> 07:34.700]  So in year one, we learned a lot about crop.
[07:35.700 --> 07:38.700]  So on the left-hand side is a picture of me standing up,
[07:38.700 --> 07:39.700]  looking down at the crops.
[07:39.700 --> 07:47.700]  That's probably about up to my knee.
[07:47.700 --> 07:50.700]  On the right-hand side is me stretching my arm up to reach the crop.
[07:50.700 --> 07:52.700]  And so maybe that, I don't know, I'm five foot.
[07:52.700 --> 07:55.700]  Three and a half on a good day. So maybe that's.
[07:55.700 --> 07:56.700]  Well, most five foot.
[07:56.700 --> 08:01.700]  Right. Not quite a six foot crop there.
[08:01.700 --> 08:04.700]  So we learned a lot about crop.
[08:04.700 --> 08:08.700]  In terms of the size of the seed head.
[08:08.700 --> 08:11.700]  And in terms of the thickness of our stock.
[08:11.700 --> 08:15.700]  So what we learn in.
[08:15.700 --> 08:20.700]  This first year had a lot to do with what we didn't know.
[08:20.700 --> 08:21.700]  And that's to be expected, right.
[08:21.700 --> 08:26.700]  It's the first time we'd ever grown this crop.
[08:26.700 --> 08:29.700]  It was really exciting to learn how many things we didn't know,
[08:29.700 --> 08:30.700]  how many things we didn't know.
[08:30.700 --> 08:32.700]  And then we learned a lot about the crop.
[08:32.700 --> 08:33.700]  And so that's a good thing.
[08:33.700 --> 08:35.700]  Because we know that we're going to be busy for the next.
[08:35.700 --> 08:36.700]  Couple of years.
[08:36.700 --> 08:37.700]  Right.
[08:37.700 --> 08:38.700]  It gives us something to work on.
[08:38.700 --> 08:39.700]  Right. So here, this was a.
[08:39.700 --> 08:41.700]  Field that was.
[08:41.700 --> 08:44.700]  Divided into quadrants.
[08:44.700 --> 08:46.700]  There were, there was.
[08:46.700 --> 08:55.700]  Half that had.
[08:56.700 --> 08:59.700]  Bedded pack manure.
[08:59.700 --> 09:05.700]  And then one side had poultry litter added it too.
[09:05.700 --> 09:08.700]  So we were looking at combinations of manures there.
[09:08.700 --> 09:12.700]  But really.
[09:12.700 --> 09:16.700]  We couldn't compare the data in these quadrants.
[09:16.700 --> 09:23.700]  The yields because the weed pressure was so great.
[09:23.700 --> 09:27.700]  And the soil was so great.
[09:27.700 --> 09:29.700]  So it was a really fun learning experience and fun to harvest that
[09:29.700 --> 09:30.700]  way anyway.
[09:30.700 --> 09:31.700]  Okay.
[09:31.700 --> 09:32.700]  Come on.
[09:32.700 --> 09:41.700]  There we go.
[09:41.700 --> 09:43.700]  So year two, and year two, we said, okay,
[09:43.700 --> 09:47.700]  we're focusing on green or maybe we can figure out a dual purpose for
[09:47.700 --> 09:48.700]  using the fiber here.
[09:48.700 --> 09:50.140]  plot study on campus.
[09:50.140 --> 09:52.900]  And when I say small, it was like a quarter of an acre,
[09:52.900 --> 09:54.780]  a really small plot study on campus
[09:54.780 --> 09:58.340]  to do in collaboration with what we were doing with JD Farm.
[09:58.340 --> 10:00.940]  We were sort of creating our grows.
[10:00.940 --> 10:06.220]  The state had now allowed farms to have their own permits.
[10:06.220 --> 10:11.420]  But then in late May, early June,
[10:11.420 --> 10:16.100]  the governor pushed to have even more acres in production.
[10:16.100 --> 10:21.300]  And so we threw 40 acres in on campus.
[10:21.300 --> 10:23.900]  That wasn't our original intention.
[10:23.900 --> 10:28.020]  And so this was our opportunity to try out
[10:28.020 --> 10:32.020]  a couple of different varieties and really just get it growing.
[10:32.020 --> 10:35.540]  Because trying to get seed that late in the game,
[10:35.540 --> 10:39.700]  we ended up not planting until somewhere around July 20.
[10:39.700 --> 10:42.900]  If you remember, the first year we planted July 4.
[10:42.900 --> 10:46.260]  July 20 was when we got those extra acres in the ground.
[10:46.260 --> 10:49.340]  And so it was a little bit crazy.
[10:49.340 --> 10:52.460]  And we hired that same local grain farmer
[10:52.460 --> 10:57.100]  to custom harvest for us, other than the small quarter
[10:57.100 --> 11:03.420]  acre of plots, which I like to say my darling slave labor,
[11:03.420 --> 11:06.020]  otherwise known as my students.
[11:06.020 --> 11:09.660]  You get a good grade for putting in some blood, sweat,
[11:09.660 --> 11:10.620]  and tears.
[11:10.660 --> 11:12.740]  And so they were in charge of doing
[11:12.740 --> 11:15.020]  all of the hand harvesting of my plots
[11:15.020 --> 11:19.540]  and separating out the grain from those plots.
[11:19.540 --> 11:22.420]  I love them dearly for all their hard work.
[11:22.420 --> 11:24.260]  So things that we learned.
[11:24.260 --> 11:27.460]  Hemp doesn't like poorly drained or excessively wet soil.
[11:27.460 --> 11:34.380]  That was the banner description of year number two.
[11:34.380 --> 11:36.380]  If you have poorly drained soil, you
[11:36.380 --> 11:38.260]  have poorly established hemp.
[11:38.300 --> 11:41.660]  We tried over and over and over to establish
[11:41.660 --> 11:46.220]  in June of that year our small quarter acre trials.
[11:46.220 --> 11:49.660]  We had to plant it three times because of how wet it was.
[11:49.660 --> 11:52.180]  This is a field where you can see where
[11:52.180 --> 11:53.660]  it dries out on this line.
[11:53.660 --> 11:55.780]  The entire field was planted.
[11:55.780 --> 12:02.260]  But all of the field in the wet area did not emerge.
[12:02.260 --> 12:05.540]  And you can see here, there's a sort of a lake
[12:05.540 --> 12:07.780]  in the middle of this field.
[12:07.780 --> 12:11.940]  June 2018 was really wet.
[12:11.940 --> 12:18.500]  So hemp does not like poorly drained or excessively
[12:18.500 --> 12:21.540]  wet soil.
[12:21.540 --> 12:26.100]  And these are the quarter acre trial plots.
[12:26.100 --> 12:29.780]  You can see the flags are this would have been the plot
[12:29.780 --> 12:32.140]  that we just had to keep trying and keep trying and keep
[12:32.140 --> 12:36.700]  trying to establish because there was so much water that
[12:36.700 --> 12:39.660]  was sad.
[12:39.660 --> 12:44.140]  And you got to see my kids in the first year.
[12:44.140 --> 12:45.460]  This is my son the second year.
[12:45.460 --> 12:47.660]  I like to show them.
[12:47.660 --> 12:50.860]  And you can see the progression of how they've grown along
[12:50.860 --> 12:52.340]  with the crops growing.
[12:52.340 --> 12:54.380]  So this is the field where we were
[12:54.380 --> 12:56.700]  supposed to be going through and counting emergence.
[12:56.700 --> 13:01.060]  And instead, we were just trying to decide
[13:01.060 --> 13:02.820]  when we were going to try and replant again
[13:02.820 --> 13:05.780]  because it was so wet.
[13:05.820 --> 13:11.500]  So July 7 was the third time that we planted there.
[13:11.500 --> 13:13.500]  And then again, two weeks later was
[13:13.500 --> 13:16.220]  when we planted the rest of our fields on campus, which
[13:16.220 --> 13:18.300]  we decided it wasn't worth doing a nitrogen rate
[13:18.300 --> 13:19.540]  trial because it was too late.
[13:19.540 --> 13:22.380]  We didn't even think we were going to get a crop.
[13:22.380 --> 13:26.860]  So some of the things that we learned this year,
[13:26.860 --> 13:30.940]  the second year, was we learned a bit about fusarium.
[13:30.940 --> 13:33.820]  We learned a bit about white mold.
[13:33.820 --> 13:38.940]  We saw that there are definitely pests in our area that
[13:38.940 --> 13:40.460]  are going to impact the crop.
[13:40.460 --> 13:47.180]  We saw that if hemp emerges after a weed species,
[13:47.180 --> 13:48.820]  that it can't outcompete.
[13:48.820 --> 13:51.940]  But if the hemp emerges before a weed species
[13:51.940 --> 13:54.380]  and is able to establish, then it
[13:54.380 --> 13:58.900]  does a whole lot better at managing weed competition.
[13:58.900 --> 14:00.900]  We saw lots more variability.
[14:00.940 --> 14:03.820]  So these two pictures are the same field
[14:03.820 --> 14:07.460]  where this student is about my height
[14:07.460 --> 14:11.980]  and the crop is up to her shoulders,
[14:11.980 --> 14:17.140]  whereas 100 yards away in that same field,
[14:17.140 --> 14:21.140]  the crop is this student's a little bit taller than me,
[14:21.140 --> 14:22.980]  but is up to her waist.
[14:22.980 --> 14:27.460]  So we're seeing just so much variability here.
[14:27.460 --> 14:31.620]  And then this is the field next to this one.
[14:31.620 --> 14:34.140]  And even though this picture is taken a month later,
[14:34.140 --> 14:36.740]  you're not getting much more growth
[14:36.740 --> 14:39.660]  after flower establishment.
[14:39.660 --> 14:42.740]  And so the fact that this student is 6 foot 1,
[14:42.740 --> 14:46.300]  so the fact that we have this tremendous growth here,
[14:46.300 --> 14:49.460]  it shows us how much variability there is within the crop.
[14:49.460 --> 14:53.460]  It shows us how much breeding work
[14:53.460 --> 14:56.740]  there is to be done to pick out the traits that
[14:56.740 --> 14:59.700]  are going to help us get whether or not
[14:59.700 --> 15:01.780]  we want a shorter crop for grain production
[15:01.780 --> 15:04.060]  or a taller crop for fiber production.
[15:04.060 --> 15:07.420]  That we need to see what are the ways that genetics can
[15:07.420 --> 15:10.380]  influence crop production versus what
[15:10.380 --> 15:14.140]  are the environmental influences of crop production.
[15:14.140 --> 15:15.980]  So many questions to ask.
[15:15.980 --> 15:19.940]  Every semester or every year, the growing season,
[15:19.940 --> 15:21.820]  we would just find out so many more questions
[15:21.820 --> 15:23.520]  that we would set out to answer one thing
[15:23.520 --> 15:26.260]  and then find 15 more questions that were like, oh, well,
[15:26.260 --> 15:28.580]  before we can answer this, we need to know these things.
[15:31.060 --> 15:35.260]  We did a little bit of work of indoor grows
[15:35.260 --> 15:38.420]  looking at microgreens.
[15:38.420 --> 15:41.620]  It was sort of interesting.
[15:41.620 --> 15:44.580]  There is this push for extracts production.
[15:44.580 --> 15:46.500]  But at the same time, we thought, well,
[15:46.500 --> 15:49.260]  what are some other horticultural ways
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.140]  of growing this crop?
[15:50.140 --> 15:56.100]  And can hemp microgreen compete in the microgreens
[15:56.140 --> 15:57.420]  market?
[15:57.420 --> 15:59.700]  One of the things that we found was
[15:59.700 --> 16:05.500]  that while its taste and palatability were really great,
[16:05.500 --> 16:11.140]  we couldn't compete with California.
[16:11.140 --> 16:13.740]  There's a reason that the majority of microgreens
[16:13.740 --> 16:16.140]  are grown in large scale horticultural production
[16:16.140 --> 16:18.620]  and not in small boutique farms.
[16:18.620 --> 16:21.420]  It's just too expensive.
[16:21.420 --> 16:23.860]  So we realized growing for extract
[16:23.860 --> 16:25.780]  is not the only horticultural hemp crop.
[16:26.460 --> 16:31.180]  Growing for microgreens was really successful.
[16:31.180 --> 16:36.140]  Baby farms had a line of microgreens
[16:36.140 --> 16:40.460]  in Whole Foods in the city for a while.
[16:40.460 --> 16:42.900]  I believe they've stopped doing that now,
[16:42.900 --> 16:44.980]  mostly because it's just too hard to keep up
[16:44.980 --> 16:48.780]  with the cost of it.
[16:48.780 --> 16:51.740]  OK, that brings us to year three, 2018.
[16:51.740 --> 16:54.980]  In 2018, we grew a little bit and started
[16:54.980 --> 16:58.740]  taking on partner farms around the state
[16:58.740 --> 17:02.020]  and expanding our nitrogen trials.
[17:02.020 --> 17:05.340]  So we really were focusing mainly
[17:05.340 --> 17:08.140]  on grain production with a little bit of fiber in there,
[17:08.140 --> 17:15.460]  but mainly grain production and just nitrogen rates
[17:15.460 --> 17:18.540]  for answering the questions of nutrient management.
[17:18.540 --> 17:20.220]  We really weren't trying to answer
[17:20.220 --> 17:22.540]  the questions for phosphorus and potassium quite yet.
[17:22.580 --> 17:26.060]  We're just focusing on nitrogen.
[17:26.060 --> 17:29.180]  There was a whole lot of drought in June that year,
[17:29.180 --> 17:32.620]  and then it got really cold.
[17:32.620 --> 17:35.340]  And August through October were super wet.
[17:35.340 --> 17:37.340]  So the combination of those things
[17:37.340 --> 17:39.820]  made the growing season a little bit difficult.
[17:39.820 --> 17:44.580]  We hired that same local grain farmer to come harvest for us,
[17:44.580 --> 17:46.900]  but that was the last time that we did that,
[17:46.900 --> 17:51.420]  because we realized that we were trying to fit a square peg
[17:51.420 --> 17:52.980]  into a round hole.
[17:52.980 --> 17:55.420]  You hear a lot of people talk about horror stories
[17:55.420 --> 17:59.700]  about harvesting hemp or grain.
[17:59.700 --> 18:03.060]  I think the problem is more trying
[18:03.060 --> 18:08.780]  to use something outfitted for soybeans for hemp
[18:08.780 --> 18:14.700]  or something outfitted for wheat for hemp.
[18:14.700 --> 18:18.020]  If we took something outfitted for soybeans
[18:18.020 --> 18:21.300]  and tried to harvest corn, we'd destroy the machine.
[18:21.300 --> 18:23.220]  It would be awful.
[18:23.220 --> 18:24.620]  Nothing good would come of that.
[18:24.620 --> 18:28.100]  And it's the same thing, that the issue isn't the crop.
[18:28.100 --> 18:32.980]  The issue is that we don't have the equipment specified
[18:32.980 --> 18:36.620]  to the crop that we're trying to harvest.
[18:36.620 --> 18:38.980]  Now, over the years, we've gotten better at that.
[18:38.980 --> 18:41.460]  And what we found was that this farmer that was harvesting
[18:41.460 --> 18:44.540]  for us wasn't willing to learn from the things
[18:44.540 --> 18:45.860]  that we were learning.
[18:45.860 --> 18:49.500]  And if you always do what you've always done,
[18:49.500 --> 18:51.060]  you'll always get what you always got.
[18:51.820 --> 18:54.380]  And so he was getting angrier and angrier
[18:54.380 --> 18:55.580]  at the hemp harvest.
[18:55.580 --> 18:57.500]  And we were getting angrier and angrier
[18:57.500 --> 19:02.580]  that what we were learning wasn't being implemented.
[19:02.580 --> 19:04.740]  And so putting those two things together,
[19:04.740 --> 19:08.220]  we said it is time for us to get our own combine
[19:08.220 --> 19:12.700]  because we need to show folks that this
[19:12.700 --> 19:15.140]  isn't as horrible as it sounds.
[19:15.140 --> 19:19.380]  One of the biggest problems with the hemp industry,
[19:19.380 --> 19:23.780]  not just in New York State, but it probably applies elsewhere,
[19:23.780 --> 19:27.020]  is lack of good information.
[19:27.020 --> 19:31.060]  And more than lack of good information,
[19:31.060 --> 19:34.940]  prevalence of bad information.
[19:34.940 --> 19:37.860]  So you have all these people telling stories
[19:37.860 --> 19:40.460]  about terrible things that happened and scaring folks off.
[19:40.460 --> 19:42.260]  We say, well, I have enough problems.
[19:42.260 --> 19:43.820]  I don't need that on my plate.
[19:43.820 --> 19:45.340]  Instead of saying, oh, no, no, look,
[19:45.340 --> 19:47.380]  we're learning how to do this better.
[19:47.380 --> 19:48.660]  And since we're learning how to do this better,
[19:48.660 --> 19:49.900]  now's the time to get involved.
[19:49.900 --> 19:54.140]  So we needed to counteract the storyline of hemp
[19:54.140 --> 19:56.620]  is nothing but a problem child.
[19:56.620 --> 20:00.060]  But in 2018, that was our last year of working
[20:00.060 --> 20:02.180]  with that other farmer.
[20:02.180 --> 20:04.300]  These are some of the nitrogen rates that we set up.
[20:04.300 --> 20:09.740]  We were looking to see how does nitrogen impact growth
[20:09.740 --> 20:16.220]  and what is the best nitrogen rate for this crop.
[20:16.220 --> 20:22.980]  One of the things that we found was with poor nutrient
[20:22.980 --> 20:28.820]  availability, and this, I guess, makes perfect sense,
[20:28.820 --> 20:31.540]  our crop isn't able to combat weeds.
[20:31.540 --> 20:34.540]  And so in our zero nitrogen rates
[20:34.540 --> 20:36.460]  and in our 50-pound nitrogen rates,
[20:36.460 --> 20:38.020]  although not so much in this field
[20:38.020 --> 20:41.980]  because there is leaching from the strips around it,
[20:41.980 --> 20:47.140]  but certainly over here, we saw horrible weed pressure
[20:47.140 --> 20:49.380]  that we just didn't see in the rest of the field.
[20:49.380 --> 20:55.980]  And so the balance of ensuring proper fertility
[20:55.980 --> 21:00.780]  will make sure that our crop can then out-compete the weed
[21:00.780 --> 21:03.420]  species that are there.
[21:03.420 --> 21:06.740]  We started dabbling in NDVI imaging,
[21:06.740 --> 21:09.140]  and it was really interesting for us.
[21:09.140 --> 21:12.620]  Our goal was to see if NDVI imaging could
[21:12.620 --> 21:18.860]  be used for determining if nitrogen applications are
[21:18.860 --> 21:20.540]  necessary.
[21:20.540 --> 21:23.940]  And so here, after looking at that previous map,
[21:23.940 --> 21:28.860]  you can see our low rates, our lower rates here
[21:28.860 --> 21:32.140]  and our low rates here, and then our high rates in between.
[21:32.140 --> 21:34.860]  The more green, the more foliage there is, the more red,
[21:34.900 --> 21:43.260]  the more brown soil is being reflected back.
[21:43.260 --> 21:46.340]  So here, this is at the end of July.
[21:46.340 --> 21:48.100]  Now, here we're looking at October 5th.
[21:54.060 --> 22:00.460]  NDVI is Normalized Difference Vegetative Index.
[22:00.460 --> 22:05.740]  And what it means is you're taking an infrared image
[22:05.740 --> 22:12.820]  and that the amount of infrared light that's reflected back.
[22:12.820 --> 22:16.580]  So this is essentially a scale that shows you how much
[22:16.580 --> 22:19.420]  is being reflected back.
[22:19.420 --> 22:25.300]  If there's a lot of light being reflected back,
[22:25.300 --> 22:27.340]  it means it's not being absorbed.
[22:27.340 --> 22:30.780]  So that means that there's no plant material there.
[22:30.780 --> 22:35.260]  And so those redder areas are the lots
[22:35.260 --> 22:39.020]  that's being reflected back.
[22:39.020 --> 22:42.140]  The green areas is lots more absorption.
[22:42.140 --> 22:47.820]  And the yellow is the scale in between the green and the red.
[22:47.820 --> 22:50.140]  So what was really interesting for us
[22:50.140 --> 22:54.940]  is the difference between the July image and the October
[22:54.940 --> 22:56.140]  image.
[22:56.140 --> 22:58.300]  You could still see those strips a little bit,
[22:58.300 --> 22:59.740]  but you've sort of lost it.
[22:59.740 --> 23:05.220]  And the reason you've lost it is because as the seeds mature,
[23:05.220 --> 23:06.020]  they're brown.
[23:06.020 --> 23:08.540]  And so they're going to be reflecting that light back.
[23:08.540 --> 23:11.420]  So then we started thinking, oh, well, maybe this imaging
[23:11.420 --> 23:14.620]  isn't just useful for nutrient management.
[23:14.620 --> 23:18.460]  Maybe this imaging might be useful for harvest readiness.
[23:18.460 --> 23:21.740]  This was a thought we had there.
[23:21.740 --> 23:25.060]  Again, every time we try and set out to answer a question,
[23:25.060 --> 23:28.060]  we get six more new ones.
[23:28.060 --> 23:30.820]  And the other thing that was really interesting
[23:30.900 --> 23:36.740]  was in this field, the left side of the field was one variety.
[23:36.740 --> 23:40.100]  And the right side of the field was the other variety.
[23:40.100 --> 23:43.980]  So I actually wrote it backwards.
[23:43.980 --> 23:46.140]  This is the Felina 32 side.
[23:46.140 --> 23:49.020]  And this is the Anka side.
[23:49.020 --> 23:52.580]  And so at the end of June, there was very little
[23:52.580 --> 23:54.260]  that was established.
[23:54.260 --> 23:56.300]  By the end of July, we really see
[23:56.300 --> 24:02.860]  a strong difference between these two varieties.
[24:02.860 --> 24:05.420]  And then in the October image, again, we
[24:05.420 --> 24:07.620]  can't see it anymore as we're ready for the harvest
[24:07.620 --> 24:09.620]  readiness.
[24:09.620 --> 24:12.220]  This field didn't get harvested.
[24:12.220 --> 24:21.300]  There was so much moisture in the later part of the summer
[24:21.300 --> 24:25.740]  and early part of the fall that coordinating
[24:25.740 --> 24:30.740]  with our person to come harvest,
[24:30.740 --> 24:35.820]  we were sort of the end of the importance list.
[24:35.820 --> 24:37.820]  I'm being very diplomatic about this.
[24:37.820 --> 24:44.500]  And therefore, our crop didn't get harvested on time.
[24:44.500 --> 24:49.620]  And at the end of September, there was,
[24:49.620 --> 24:52.100]  let's see if that's going to let me,
[24:52.140 --> 24:56.500]  I think I need to get back to my pointer to be able.
[24:56.500 --> 24:57.340]  There we go.
[24:57.340 --> 24:59.380]  So at the end of September, there
[24:59.380 --> 25:01.660]  was this horrible windstorm.
[25:01.660 --> 25:08.800]  And the crop was more than ready to be harvested.
[25:08.800 --> 25:14.600]  So all of that shaking and all of that wind
[25:14.600 --> 25:20.210]  essentially put all of our seed on the ground.
[25:20.210 --> 25:26.410]  So when the farmer came to harvest this field
[25:26.410 --> 25:31.290]  and instead of getting between probably 7 and 800 pounds
[25:31.290 --> 25:33.050]  of grain per acre in this field, he
[25:33.050 --> 25:35.610]  was getting 80 pounds of grain per acre.
[25:35.610 --> 25:38.410]  He just gave up and said, it's not worth your time.
[25:38.410 --> 25:39.370]  It's not worth my time.
[25:39.370 --> 25:40.650]  I'm not going to do it.
[25:40.650 --> 25:45.210]  So that field didn't end up getting harvested.
[25:45.210 --> 25:47.410]  And so we weren't able to compare the yield
[25:47.410 --> 25:49.250]  results between those two varieties, which
[25:49.290 --> 25:50.810]  could have been really lovely.
[25:50.810 --> 25:54.090]  But what we did see was the importance
[25:54.090 --> 25:55.650]  of harvesting on time.
[25:55.650 --> 25:58.370]  And we learned that the harvest window for hemp
[25:58.370 --> 26:00.890]  is really narrow.
[26:00.890 --> 26:03.970]  Once that seed starts to dry out,
[26:03.970 --> 26:06.610]  it really falls off really quickly.
[26:06.610 --> 26:11.890]  And so harvest readiness is an incredibly important
[26:11.890 --> 26:14.290]  characteristic to pay attention to when
[26:14.290 --> 26:16.130]  we're dealing with grain.
[26:16.130 --> 26:17.730]  When we're dealing with fiber as well,
[26:17.730 --> 26:19.850]  I guess when we're dealing with extract as well.
[26:19.850 --> 26:23.730]  Knowing that window is really important.
[26:23.730 --> 26:30.170]  OK, so we harvested the fiber with a sickle bar mower.
[26:30.170 --> 26:38.050]  And as you can see here, we were on the slope a little bit.
[26:38.050 --> 26:39.330]  And there was wind.
[26:39.330 --> 26:44.170]  And the fiber was falling into the standing crop there.
[26:44.170 --> 26:46.770]  So my job was to follow the sickle bar
[26:46.810 --> 26:50.010]  and take armfuls of the fiber and toss it
[26:50.010 --> 26:58.290]  so that we can come through and get the next big swath cut.
[27:01.170 --> 27:02.650]  That was more exercise than I think
[27:02.650 --> 27:04.290]  I've ever gotten in my life.
[27:04.290 --> 27:10.250]  And at the very end of it, when there was just one armful left,
[27:10.250 --> 27:12.850]  there was a surprise waiting for us in the field.
[27:12.890 --> 27:16.810]  There was a skunk who had just walked out of its little hole
[27:16.810 --> 27:20.490]  and, surprise, saw us turn around, lifted its tail.
[27:20.490 --> 27:25.330]  And so I had just been throwing these huge piles of hemp
[27:25.330 --> 27:27.650]  so that we can come through and cut.
[27:27.650 --> 27:30.650]  And if nothing else, that was a study
[27:30.650 --> 27:33.890]  on the benefit of adrenaline because I
[27:33.890 --> 27:36.050]  sprinted across that field faster than I've ever
[27:36.050 --> 27:37.650]  run in my life.
[27:37.690 --> 27:42.850]  And the skunk got the sickle bar, but nothing else.
[27:42.850 --> 27:45.090]  And the skunk's tail is in that field.
[27:45.090 --> 27:47.170]  And I've been told that that tail was then
[27:47.170 --> 27:49.290]  collected and preserved.
[27:49.290 --> 27:52.330]  But I still haven't seen it.
[27:52.330 --> 27:55.810]  So this was our first year of actually harvesting
[27:55.810 --> 27:57.010]  for fiber, though.
[27:57.010 --> 28:00.570]  And we were learning a little bit about it.
[28:00.570 --> 28:02.170]  One of the things that we did after that
[28:02.170 --> 28:05.650]  was add this little triangle to the end of the sickle bar
[28:05.650 --> 28:07.890]  to make sure the fiber tips in the right direction
[28:07.890 --> 28:11.370]  and doesn't fall on the crop before it.
[28:11.370 --> 28:15.650]  So all of this had to be picked up and thrown
[28:15.650 --> 28:18.690]  so that we can continue to go through the field.
[28:18.690 --> 28:21.250]  And then we let it ret in the field
[28:21.250 --> 28:24.250]  and raked it with a rotary rake and then came through
[28:24.250 --> 28:25.370]  and round baled it.
[28:25.370 --> 28:30.690]  And we were looking for dumbness,
[28:30.730 --> 28:36.210]  so totally different focus than with our grain here.
[28:36.210 --> 28:39.930]  We want to see the vast fibers starting
[28:39.930 --> 28:42.050]  to pull away from the herd.
[28:42.050 --> 28:44.090]  And we want an evenness in color.
[28:44.090 --> 28:50.250]  We don't want too much of this dark black
[28:50.250 --> 28:53.050]  here with this light here.
[28:53.050 --> 28:55.330]  We want it to be much more even there.
[28:55.330 --> 28:59.130]  But this was our first year and our first go around at it,
[28:59.170 --> 29:02.690]  our first trial of retting in the field.
[29:02.690 --> 29:06.650]  So in 2019, we were set to do that better
[29:06.650 --> 29:08.450]  and decided that we were really going
[29:08.450 --> 29:12.050]  to split our acres of half grain and half fiber.
[29:12.050 --> 29:17.050]  And then we've also been hearing a lot about,
[29:17.050 --> 29:20.210]  can we do a dual purpose with extracts?
[29:20.210 --> 29:23.050]  Do we have to do our extracts production
[29:23.050 --> 29:24.570]  in a horticultural style?
[29:24.570 --> 29:26.410]  Or can we do it in a field crop style, which
[29:26.410 --> 29:29.290]  is sort of how they do it more commonly in Europe?
[29:29.290 --> 29:32.650]  We tried a study of that.
[29:32.650 --> 29:37.770]  And our horticulture department did our first outdoor grow
[29:37.770 --> 29:42.170]  for our high CBD varieties.
[29:42.170 --> 29:44.690]  So we began focusing on those nitrogen rate trials,
[29:44.690 --> 29:49.330]  focusing on organic versus inorganic amendments.
[29:49.330 --> 29:56.170]  And oops, that was 2018's drought.
[29:56.210 --> 30:00.370]  So what happened in 2019 weather wise?
[30:00.370 --> 30:02.650]  I think 2019 was an OK growing season.
[30:02.650 --> 30:06.370]  I don't remember right now.
[30:06.370 --> 30:10.650]  How can that be 20 minutes already?
[30:10.650 --> 30:11.570]  All right.
[30:11.570 --> 30:14.970]  Now I know I have 10 minutes left.
[30:14.970 --> 30:24.170]  And so that year, we found ourselves a 1973-ish
[30:24.170 --> 30:26.210]  international combine.
[30:26.210 --> 30:28.930]  And it took us a little while to get it on hand.
[30:28.930 --> 30:31.690]  So we harvested a little bit later than we wanted to.
[30:31.690 --> 30:33.650]  So we ended up doing a bit of harvesting by hand
[30:33.650 --> 30:37.450]  just to be able to compare our nitrogen rate trials.
[30:37.450 --> 30:40.970]  It was really exciting for us to have a combine of our own
[30:40.970 --> 30:45.850]  and be able to show that this was going
[30:45.850 --> 30:50.890]  to be a successful crop.
[30:50.890 --> 30:54.850]  And so we did a little bit different this year.
[30:54.850 --> 30:59.090]  We had fewer nitrogen rates that we
[30:59.090 --> 31:00.890]  did in strips in one field.
[31:00.890 --> 31:03.770]  And then in the field across from it,
[31:03.770 --> 31:07.770]  all four quadrants received manure
[31:07.770 --> 31:10.050]  in the winter and early spring.
[31:10.050 --> 31:17.210]  And then A and B were top dressed at our medium rate
[31:17.210 --> 31:21.050]  as our inorganic field across the way from it
[31:21.050 --> 31:24.490]  was to see if that combination of organic and inorganic
[31:24.490 --> 31:29.770]  amendments was better than just the organic amendments.
[31:29.770 --> 31:37.130]  And so we also had A and D were one variety,
[31:37.130 --> 31:39.810]  and B and C were another variety because we're
[31:39.810 --> 31:44.730]  seeing really large differences between varieties.
[31:44.770 --> 31:48.930]  And so this is the way that that map was set up there.
[31:48.930 --> 31:51.450]  So I'm going to show you a couple of NDVI images now
[31:51.450 --> 31:52.410]  of that.
[31:52.410 --> 31:53.730]  Oh, we're not yet first.
[31:53.730 --> 31:59.290]  We also do reduced tillage, not really no till.
[31:59.290 --> 32:01.490]  We run an airway through some of our fields.
[32:01.490 --> 32:04.410]  And so there's lots of cover on the ground.
[32:04.410 --> 32:08.930]  And what we were finding was that if there's
[32:08.930 --> 32:10.930]  far too much cover on the ground,
[32:10.930 --> 32:14.130]  you get really poor emergence.
[32:14.130 --> 32:18.170]  But with just a moderate amount of cover on the ground,
[32:18.170 --> 32:24.890]  our emergence was no different than if our field was bare.
[32:24.890 --> 32:27.050]  So that was fun for us to learn.
[32:27.050 --> 32:31.450]  And we also saw this is a field that was conventionally tilled.
[32:31.450 --> 32:34.210]  And then there was the, so it was conventionally tilled
[32:34.210 --> 32:34.930]  and they planted.
[32:34.930 --> 32:37.410]  And that same night, they had a huge rainstorm.
[32:37.410 --> 32:40.170]  So after that huge rainstorm, you get this surface cresting.
[32:40.170 --> 32:42.530]  And you'll see the only places where the hemp actually
[32:42.530 --> 32:45.450]  came up are in cracks within that surface.
[32:45.450 --> 32:49.970]  So we really saw the importance of planning, of planting time,
[32:49.970 --> 32:53.570]  particularly in a conventionally tilled soil
[32:53.570 --> 32:55.970]  where you can get these surface crests.
[32:55.970 --> 32:57.610]  So we were just learning left and right.
[32:57.610 --> 33:01.810]  Everything we did was, we were learning more.
[33:01.810 --> 33:05.410]  So here, this is an image of September 3rd.
[33:05.410 --> 33:09.250]  And we're comparing this image is just your regular RGB,
[33:09.250 --> 33:13.610]  your regular picture that you could take with your phone,
[33:13.610 --> 33:16.090]  as opposed to a picture that you can take
[33:16.090 --> 33:20.250]  with the infrared camera.
[33:20.250 --> 33:23.450]  And to the naked eye, you can see the difference
[33:23.450 --> 33:25.890]  between what was top dressed and what wasn't,
[33:25.890 --> 33:27.250]  which is sort of interesting.
[33:27.250 --> 33:29.130]  But it's really not as easy to see
[33:29.130 --> 33:34.250]  the difference between the varieties as you can see here.
[33:34.250 --> 33:35.970]  Here, they showed us that this field was
[33:35.970 --> 33:37.970]  too small for our strips because there
[33:37.970 --> 33:43.090]  was leaching in between our different nitrogen rates,
[33:43.090 --> 33:46.930]  except for this back area here.
[33:46.930 --> 33:48.610]  That area with the low nitrogen rate,
[33:48.610 --> 33:50.930]  you can really see the difference with the naked eye.
[33:50.930 --> 33:53.890]  Do you need an infrared camera for that?
[33:53.890 --> 33:54.650]  No.
[33:54.650 --> 33:56.450]  But you can see a little bit more detail
[33:56.450 --> 33:58.690]  with that infrared camera.
[33:58.690 --> 34:02.930]  We also did a study partnering with a private company
[34:02.930 --> 34:05.930]  to test their product to see if their metabolism booster
[34:05.930 --> 34:09.970]  could take a European CBD variety, which
[34:09.970 --> 34:13.970]  means that in Europe, if a crop produces 3% CBD,
[34:13.970 --> 34:17.290]  it's considered a CBD variety.
[34:17.290 --> 34:19.810]  So we took a European CBD variety
[34:19.810 --> 34:23.090]  and sprayed it with their, I think
[34:23.090 --> 34:26.050]  it's another one of them getting that, my students
[34:26.050 --> 34:29.250]  a year ago getting the sprayer ready.
[34:29.250 --> 34:32.010]  So we sprayed it with this metabolism booster
[34:32.010 --> 34:35.010]  to see how that would do.
[34:35.050 --> 34:39.210]  We had some issues that year with, well,
[34:39.210 --> 34:41.650]  this special variety that we bought
[34:41.650 --> 34:44.210]  took an extra month to get here.
[34:44.210 --> 34:45.170]  So we planted late.
[34:45.170 --> 34:47.930]  And because we planted late, the weeds
[34:47.930 --> 34:50.570]  came back after killing what was in that field with ground up.
[34:50.570 --> 34:52.010]  It was a mess.
[34:52.010 --> 34:54.690]  So we didn't get the research results
[34:54.690 --> 34:56.250]  that we wanted to from that field.
[34:56.250 --> 34:59.450]  So we redid it this year in the greenhouse.
[34:59.450 --> 35:01.690]  We got the harvest with our own combine.
[35:01.690 --> 35:03.490]  We did some modifications to this combine.
[35:03.490 --> 35:05.650]  This was a really great learning experience for us
[35:05.650 --> 35:09.370]  to see what has to be modified and what doesn't.
[35:09.370 --> 35:11.770]  We only had one small fire.
[35:11.770 --> 35:14.130]  And that was easily doused.
[35:14.130 --> 35:17.370]  So that was lovely.
[35:17.370 --> 35:19.850]  And this is a student walking behind the combine
[35:19.850 --> 35:22.290]  just checking to make sure that everything is flowing out
[35:22.290 --> 35:24.650]  of it smoothly.
[35:24.650 --> 35:30.490]  And our fiber harvest, this is the video
[35:30.490 --> 35:36.010]  that folks growing for extracts hate to see.
[35:36.010 --> 35:42.730]  Because as that fiber falls, you can see the clouds of pollen
[35:42.730 --> 35:44.130]  coming out of it.
[35:44.130 --> 35:46.330]  The appropriate time to harvest for fiber
[35:46.330 --> 35:50.490]  is before the females have been pollinated.
[35:50.490 --> 35:52.850]  We don't want the male plants to die yet,
[35:52.850 --> 35:56.610]  because the male plants will die after they release the pollen.
[35:56.610 --> 35:58.450]  Otherwise, you lose half of your fiber crop
[35:58.450 --> 36:00.210]  if you let the male plants die.
[36:00.490 --> 36:03.850]  And the female plants, once they're pollinated,
[36:03.850 --> 36:05.410]  the fiber quality changes.
[36:05.410 --> 36:08.570]  So this is the right time to harvest,
[36:08.570 --> 36:11.610]  which means there was a lot of wind that day.
[36:11.610 --> 36:13.050]  There was a lot of pollen moving.
[36:13.050 --> 36:16.850]  But as you can see, this is not a flat landscape.
[36:16.850 --> 36:20.210]  How far that pollen will travel, I
[36:20.210 --> 36:22.050]  believe that Cornell's doing a really good job
[36:22.050 --> 36:24.010]  of answering that question.
[36:24.010 --> 36:29.970]  But truly not as far as folks worry, I think.
[36:30.010 --> 36:31.810]  As you can see, that's a whole lot of pollen
[36:31.810 --> 36:34.930]  coming out of that crop.
[36:34.930 --> 36:37.330]  But also, the crop was falling straight the way
[36:37.330 --> 36:41.130]  that it needed to, because we have that little triangle
[36:41.130 --> 36:44.210]  on the end of the field.
[36:44.210 --> 36:46.450]  Oops, that's not what I want.
[36:46.450 --> 36:47.490]  There we go.
[36:47.490 --> 36:51.410]  So again, we ret in the field.
[36:51.410 --> 36:53.810]  We did much better in the second year of retting,
[36:53.810 --> 36:56.570]  getting a much more even ret.
[36:56.610 --> 36:59.530]  And we baled that fiber.
[36:59.530 --> 37:01.690]  And in our first year, we had a little trouble
[37:01.690 --> 37:02.570]  with the round baler.
[37:02.570 --> 37:04.930]  In our second year, we learned that we
[37:04.930 --> 37:09.210]  needed to just do a little bit of protecting here
[37:09.210 --> 37:12.450]  of the wires that go from the tractor to the baler.
[37:12.450 --> 37:15.530]  And once those are protected, everything else went smoothly.
[37:15.530 --> 37:17.250]  And so this was a really good example
[37:17.250 --> 37:26.050]  of where you have these terrible stories of doing thousands
[37:26.050 --> 37:27.530]  of dollars of damage to equipment,
[37:27.530 --> 37:30.610]  but then you were like, oh, well, this wasn't hard to fix.
[37:30.610 --> 37:33.490]  And then now it's not a problem anymore.
[37:33.490 --> 37:38.930]  So in 2020, we didn't grow for grain, because it's 2020.
[37:38.930 --> 37:40.290]  Who knew what was going to happen?
[37:40.290 --> 37:42.930]  And so I didn't want to set up grain trials.
[37:42.930 --> 37:46.050]  I knew I had two student interns,
[37:46.050 --> 37:47.810]  but I wasn't exactly positive if I
[37:47.810 --> 37:50.170]  was going to be able to have them for the whole summer.
[37:50.170 --> 37:54.090]  And so we went through the easy route.
[37:54.130 --> 37:58.050]  And we decided that fiber was the easy way to go.
[37:58.050 --> 38:02.010]  We were focusing, instead of on different nitrogen rates,
[38:02.010 --> 38:05.490]  we were focusing on could we see a difference in using
[38:05.490 --> 38:07.010]  a leguminous cover crop.
[38:07.010 --> 38:09.490]  And so we looked at cowpeas, and we looked at alfalfa,
[38:09.490 --> 38:11.610]  or sorry, not cover crop, intercrop.
[38:11.610 --> 38:13.810]  We also partnered with Beacon SCIF.
[38:13.810 --> 38:17.570]  And they were doing a large CBD grow this year
[38:17.570 --> 38:20.730]  and let us come in and take soil samples
[38:20.730 --> 38:23.250]  and take plant samples throughout the growing season.
[38:23.290 --> 38:26.650]  To see if we can track accumulation of heavy metals,
[38:26.650 --> 38:32.970]  there's been a lot of talk of hemp as a heavy metal
[38:32.970 --> 38:35.570]  produced or hyper accumulator.
[38:35.570 --> 38:36.050]  There we go.
[38:36.050 --> 38:37.730]  Those are the words I'm looking for.
[38:37.730 --> 38:41.850]  And so that was our opportunity to get into that space
[38:41.850 --> 38:44.130]  and see if that's true for two reasons.
[38:44.130 --> 38:46.490]  One, because if you're producing an extract,
[38:46.490 --> 38:48.530]  would that extract with heavy metals
[38:48.530 --> 38:50.490]  and it then become problematic?
[38:50.490 --> 38:52.770]  And two, to prove whether or not it really
[38:52.770 --> 38:54.570]  does hyper accumulate heavy metals
[38:54.570 --> 38:59.250]  and can it be used for phytoremediation.
[38:59.250 --> 39:02.490]  Man, there was a lot of drought this June.
[39:02.490 --> 39:07.410]  So even though we planted on time, maybe a week late,
[39:07.410 --> 39:09.930]  our crop didn't emerge until July
[39:09.930 --> 39:12.770]  because there was just no rain.
[39:12.770 --> 39:17.290]  And so we went through and hand harvested the plots
[39:17.290 --> 39:18.370]  that we wanted to.
[39:18.370 --> 39:20.650]  But really, we just sickle barred and let
[39:20.650 --> 39:22.610]  the crop lay in the field because there just
[39:22.610 --> 39:23.250]  wasn't enough.
[39:23.250 --> 39:25.250]  It was too dry a year.
[39:25.250 --> 39:27.530]  So this is, you can see how big my kids gotten.
[39:27.530 --> 39:29.050]  Isn't he cute?
[39:29.050 --> 39:33.610]  This is at the Beacon-Skiff field.
[39:33.610 --> 39:36.050]  Their CBD grow looked really beautiful.
[39:36.050 --> 39:38.010]  They did a great job.
[39:38.010 --> 39:41.370]  And this is our fiber field on the day it was being harvested.
[39:41.370 --> 39:43.930]  And this is probably the best part of the field,
[39:43.930 --> 39:46.370]  where my laser pointer is.
[39:46.370 --> 39:49.090]  It's about between five and six foot tall.
[39:49.090 --> 39:51.210]  But this right here is only three foot tall.
[39:51.210 --> 39:54.090]  So it was quite a mess.
[39:54.090 --> 39:59.250]  We also did a repeat of the metabolism booster study.
[39:59.250 --> 40:03.530]  But we did it in the greenhouse.
[40:03.530 --> 40:07.210]  And so here, you can see a major pest problem that we saw.
[40:07.210 --> 40:10.530]  And we're waiting to get our data back about extracts
[40:10.530 --> 40:15.250]  because we noted that there were plants that were infested.
[40:15.250 --> 40:18.010]  And there were a couple of hundred plants
[40:18.010 --> 40:19.290]  right on top of each other.
[40:19.290 --> 40:21.290]  And they weren't all infested.
[40:21.290 --> 40:25.610]  And so we wanted to see if whether the amount of cannabinoids
[40:25.610 --> 40:28.410]  being produced has something to do with whether or not
[40:28.410 --> 40:29.890]  the plants were covered.
[40:29.890 --> 40:32.570]  And so this is going to be another one of our questions
[40:32.570 --> 40:37.370]  of does extract concentration has something
[40:37.370 --> 40:39.770]  to do with resistance to pest pressure?
[40:39.770 --> 40:40.890]  Who knows?
[40:40.890 --> 40:42.530]  And then this was just today in lab.
[40:42.530 --> 40:46.890]  We had students doing an olive oil extraction process just
[40:46.890 --> 40:50.210]  to see that there are quite a few different ways
[40:50.210 --> 40:59.770]  of extracting cannabinoids and terpenes from our plants
[40:59.770 --> 41:05.090]  and will then go through a distillation process.
[41:05.090 --> 41:06.570]  So what have we learned?
[41:06.570 --> 41:08.570]  We've learned about weed management.
[41:08.570 --> 41:10.850]  We've learned that we need breeding.
[41:10.850 --> 41:12.530]  So thank you, Cornell, for all the work
[41:12.530 --> 41:14.130]  you're doing in breeding because, man,
[41:14.130 --> 41:16.570]  are there a lot of traits that we're not sure.
[41:16.570 --> 41:18.050]  What's being controlled by genetics?
[41:18.050 --> 41:20.050]  What's being controlled by environmental factors?
[41:20.050 --> 41:23.410]  And how do those two come together?
[41:23.410 --> 41:26.050]  We know that getting nutrient management correct
[41:26.050 --> 41:33.570]  is vital not just for yield but also for competitiveness.
[41:33.570 --> 41:36.490]  But it's really hard because so far each growing season
[41:36.490 --> 41:41.290]  we've had a but because the weather has really interfered.
[41:41.330 --> 41:47.450]  Pest pressure has really been all over the place.
[41:47.450 --> 41:49.930]  But I think what's most important to me
[41:49.930 --> 41:52.210]  and the biggest take-home message for me
[41:52.210 --> 41:55.810]  is that there is so much variability here.
[41:55.810 --> 41:57.290]  And if you're growing for extracts,
[41:57.290 --> 41:59.250]  you also have a fiber crop.
[41:59.250 --> 42:02.730]  And if you're growing for a fiber crop,
[42:02.730 --> 42:05.090]  maybe there's also extract potential.
[42:05.090 --> 42:06.890]  And if you're growing for grain, what are you
[42:06.890 --> 42:08.890]  going to do with that leftover fiber?
[42:08.890 --> 42:15.490]  And so we need to know what is your focus for your crop
[42:15.490 --> 42:19.050]  and then where is your crop going to go.
[42:19.050 --> 42:21.610]  And before a seed or a clone goes in the ground,
[42:21.610 --> 42:24.690]  we need to know where that's going to go to because our supply
[42:24.690 --> 42:27.490]  chain needs work.
[42:27.490 --> 42:30.090]  And there are a lot of shysters in the extract world.
[42:30.090 --> 42:33.410]  And so you've got to be careful with who you're dealing with.
[42:33.410 --> 42:35.090]  And there's no such thing as a waste product
[42:35.090 --> 42:39.810]  that we can develop this supply chain better.
[42:39.810 --> 42:46.130]  There is so much potential for usable portions of this crop.
[42:46.130 --> 42:50.930]  But there is still a lot of bad information out there.
[42:50.930 --> 42:54.530]  And the community at large needs to understand
[42:54.530 --> 42:57.770]  that this is a crop just like any other crop.
[42:57.770 --> 43:04.170]  So my funding sources have been all across the board
[43:04.170 --> 43:06.010]  throughout the past five years.
[43:06.010 --> 43:14.720]  And with that, I'm happy to take any questions.
[43:14.720 --> 43:16.440]  I'll start with a question, Jen.
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.200]  And first of all, thank you for a fascinating seminar.
[43:20.200 --> 43:23.760]  And so glad that you were able to outrun that skunk.
[43:26.760 --> 43:29.560]  It was really one of my favorite stories so far.
[43:29.560 --> 43:30.600]  Yes.
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.640]  Amazing how fast we can run when necessary.
[43:35.640 --> 43:38.680]  So my question for you is, anytime
[43:38.680 --> 43:44.800]  you're growing a cannabis crop, there are security issues.
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.720]  And on a college campus, how does one
[43:48.720 --> 43:52.440]  alert the public that what you are growing
[43:52.440 --> 43:59.480]  is a crop that does not have THC potential?
[43:59.480 --> 44:02.920]  Well, I started with signs.
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.800]  And then I went to all of the professors
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.160]  who taught first-year experience courses
[44:11.160 --> 44:15.040]  so that all of the freshmen would hear the,
[44:15.040 --> 44:17.200]  this is hemp for grain and fiber,
[44:17.200 --> 44:21.240]  not anything that's going to get you high talk.
[44:21.240 --> 44:28.080]  And then I went to the student senate and talked to them.
[44:28.080 --> 44:30.640]  And I mean, it really is a lot of word of mouth.
[44:30.640 --> 44:32.880]  And because there are a lot of ag students on campus,
[44:32.880 --> 44:36.760]  they were able to do some of the smacking up I had for me.
[44:36.760 --> 44:38.320]  But there were definitely students
[44:38.320 --> 44:40.720]  who went into the field our first two years
[44:40.720 --> 44:43.760]  and grabbed samples and tried to sell them.
[44:43.760 --> 44:46.480]  That was always fun.
[44:46.480 --> 44:50.640]  But I can do as much education as I can.
[44:50.640 --> 44:53.360]  And then they just have to learn on their own
[44:53.360 --> 44:56.320]  that they're being filmed.
[44:56.320 --> 44:57.800]  Great.
[44:57.800 --> 45:00.680]  It was all about using my resources on campus, though.
[45:00.680 --> 45:03.640]  Yeah, sounds like you were very thorough.
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.120]  I would love to see if Larry Smart has a question,
[45:07.120 --> 45:11.760]  given the work that he's doing on cannabis.
[45:11.760 --> 45:17.100]  Hi, Larry.
[45:17.100 --> 45:17.500]  Hi, Jen.
[45:17.500 --> 45:19.780]  Thanks very much for giving that excellent seminar.
[45:22.940 --> 45:25.180]  Yeah, I'm curious about your modification
[45:25.180 --> 45:26.420]  on the sickle bar mower.
[45:27.420 --> 45:30.500]  We've made some modifications to our sickle bar mower,
[45:30.500 --> 45:32.180]  but we don't have a baler.
[45:32.180 --> 45:35.660]  So we haven't done that large-scale fiber production
[45:35.660 --> 45:36.460]  that you have.
[45:39.980 --> 45:42.780]  So can you describe that a little bit more?
[45:42.780 --> 45:44.980]  Yeah, Larry, it is so simple.
[45:44.980 --> 45:48.980]  It's literally a wooden triangle.
[45:48.980 --> 45:51.980]  So if this is the sickle bar, the triangle,
[45:51.980 --> 45:55.020]  and my tractor is over here, I'm going
[45:55.020 --> 45:56.700]  to pull the tractor over here.
[45:56.700 --> 46:01.260]  The triangle comes out a little bit, and so it's angled.
[46:01.260 --> 46:04.460]  So instead of being like this, it's angled like that.
[46:04.460 --> 46:08.780]  So as the sickle bar pushes through the crop,
[46:08.780 --> 46:11.060]  it's pulling the crop back towards the tractor
[46:11.060 --> 46:14.460]  to fall instead of falling back into the crop.
[46:14.460 --> 46:17.140]  It was just the simplest addition there,
[46:17.140 --> 46:19.700]  and it did an amazing job.
[46:19.700 --> 46:22.380]  That second year, our crop was also a little bit smaller.
[46:22.380 --> 46:24.500]  And so we don't know if that was part of the reason
[46:24.500 --> 46:27.580]  that it fell so nicely also.
[46:27.580 --> 46:30.220]  But it seemed, and this year, I don't
[46:30.220 --> 46:32.300]  know if I want to talk about our fields this year.
[46:32.300 --> 46:33.900]  They were so sad.
[46:33.900 --> 46:38.540]  And so I want to see next year if it works as well again.
[46:38.540 --> 46:42.340]  But it was a really simple change.
[46:42.340 --> 46:43.220]  Thank you.
[46:43.220 --> 46:45.740]  Thank you.
[46:45.740 --> 46:49.900]  Other questions for Jen?
[46:49.900 --> 46:52.980]  Yeah, and I know this isn't exactly up the alley of most
[46:52.980 --> 46:55.020]  horticulture program where you're focused more
[46:55.020 --> 46:57.500]  on the indoor grows.
[46:57.500 --> 47:01.700]  But I really think there is a lot of overlap
[47:01.700 --> 47:05.020]  and a lot of collaboration between the different styles
[47:05.020 --> 47:08.850]  of production.
[47:08.850 --> 47:11.290]  Don, maybe just one more quick question.
[47:11.290 --> 47:14.850]  Jen, you said you grew some new crosses this year.
[47:14.850 --> 47:17.970]  Can you describe those a little bit more?
[47:17.970 --> 47:18.490]  Sure.
[47:18.490 --> 47:26.610]  So last year, they grew berry blossom and selena 32,
[47:26.610 --> 47:28.090]  and they crossed them.
[47:28.090 --> 47:33.450]  So that we had a berry blossom selena 32 crossed.
[47:33.450 --> 47:35.850]  So instead of being tree style, it
[47:35.850 --> 47:39.130]  was much more erect and upright.
[47:39.130 --> 47:43.210]  And so I actually just sent those out for cannabinoid
[47:43.210 --> 47:44.970]  analysis yesterday.
[47:44.970 --> 47:53.010]  And we're curious if that stays upward of 7% or 8%,
[47:53.010 --> 47:59.330]  if that becomes a way of being able to grow field crop
[47:59.330 --> 48:02.330]  production style instead of horticultural production style.
[48:02.330 --> 48:07.170]  Because that could be cut with a combine
[48:07.170 --> 48:12.730]  and separated out as opposed to some
[48:12.770 --> 48:15.330]  of the more labor intensive hand ways
[48:15.330 --> 48:20.130]  or the ways that we're doing it under a plastic.
[48:20.130 --> 48:23.570]  But you got that from Kaylin and Dan?
[48:23.570 --> 48:24.970]  No, we did it ourselves.
[48:24.970 --> 48:26.170]  Oh, OK.
[48:26.170 --> 48:30.290]  Yeah, no, we did it ourselves last year.
[48:30.290 --> 48:35.050]  Yeah, so we had a student last year
[48:35.050 --> 48:39.010]  whose family donated about 100 seed suss
[48:39.010 --> 48:40.770]  of a bunch of different varieties.
[48:40.810 --> 48:44.370]  And so that's where we got the high CBD varieties
[48:44.370 --> 48:45.490]  from to start with.
[48:45.490 --> 48:48.290]  And then we did our whole department
[48:48.290 --> 48:53.530]  has been teaching a lot about propagation and breeding.
[48:53.530 --> 48:57.250]  And so they did that cross and then grew it out
[48:57.250 --> 49:02.370]  in the field this year to see how it would do structure wise.
[49:02.370 --> 49:03.850]  Great, thank you.
[49:03.850 --> 49:05.890]  That should be fun.
[49:05.890 --> 49:09.970]  Any final questions for Jen before we finish up?
[49:09.970 --> 49:11.290]  Thomas.
[49:11.290 --> 49:12.890]  Yeah, nice talk.
[49:12.890 --> 49:16.570]  So your final point there with the growers
[49:16.570 --> 49:20.090]  need to know who's buying what they're growing
[49:20.090 --> 49:22.330]  before they even plant it.
[49:22.330 --> 49:26.850]  That's sort of a common problem when field crop growers get
[49:26.850 --> 49:28.930]  into any horticultural crop.
[49:28.930 --> 49:30.810]  And this one's more challenging.
[49:30.810 --> 49:34.050]  And I'm curious what the sense was among the growers
[49:34.050 --> 49:35.370]  that you are working with.
[49:36.370 --> 49:41.610]  How did they have some sense of who is going to be buying it?
[49:41.610 --> 49:45.130]  Did they figure it would work itself out in the meantime?
[49:45.130 --> 49:47.930]  Or were there already buyers that they just show up
[49:47.930 --> 49:51.130]  like you do to a grain elevator?
[49:51.130 --> 49:53.090]  So I had a couple of growers that
[49:53.090 --> 49:54.730]  were planning on processing themselves
[49:54.730 --> 49:59.050]  that had ideas about producing their own hemp oil.
[49:59.050 --> 50:02.650]  And so harvesting the grain to press for oil.
[50:03.610 --> 50:06.290]  That was the most common, oh, I don't
[50:06.290 --> 50:09.490]  need to worry about a buyer because I'm going to do this.
[50:09.490 --> 50:14.010]  But it is such a different way of thinking
[50:14.010 --> 50:16.610]  that you don't ever worry about being
[50:16.610 --> 50:18.890]  able to sell corn or soybeans or oats or wheat.
[50:18.890 --> 50:20.570]  Like that's not a problem.
[50:20.570 --> 50:23.250]  You may not make money at it, but you can always sell it.
[50:23.250 --> 50:23.970]  Exactly.
[50:23.970 --> 50:27.850]  And I think that this is a two sided problem.
[50:27.850 --> 50:31.930]  One is that there is the field crop producers who
[50:31.970 --> 50:32.890]  aren't used to that.
[50:32.890 --> 50:36.330]  And two is the other side of hemp production,
[50:36.330 --> 50:38.330]  there are a whole lot of people who have never
[50:38.330 --> 50:41.170]  grown a thing in their life who all of a sudden were like,
[50:41.170 --> 50:44.370]  I'm going to be a farmer because hemp is legal.
[50:44.370 --> 50:48.850]  So it's not that our fruit and veg farmers are all
[50:48.850 --> 50:51.490]  jumping on board because you're right.
[50:51.490 --> 50:53.770]  That is part of that production model
[50:53.770 --> 50:56.250]  where you have to know where it's going.
[50:56.250 --> 51:00.930]  This was more different.
[51:00.970 --> 51:01.490]  Yeah.
[51:01.490 --> 51:04.690]  So that's why you did get both.
[51:04.690 --> 51:06.450]  At least both of those audiences.
[51:06.450 --> 51:10.650]  Yes, the new farm, the not experienced enough farmer
[51:10.650 --> 51:12.450]  and the way too experienced farmer.
[51:12.450 --> 51:13.290]  Yes.
[51:13.290 --> 51:15.130]  Yes, exactly.
[51:15.130 --> 51:17.250]  Well, I'm afraid we've run out of time.
[51:17.250 --> 51:21.450]  But Jen, this has been just delightful and informative.
[51:21.450 --> 51:24.530]  And we are so pleased and appreciative
[51:24.530 --> 51:26.890]  that you were willing to share today.
[51:26.890 --> 51:27.770]  Oh, thanks so much.
[51:27.770 --> 51:33.130]  I really appreciate you having me.
[51:33.650 --> 51:37.130]  This has been a production of Cornell University,
[51:37.130 --> 51:40.130]  on the web at cornell.edu.
