[00:00.000 --> 00:04.280]  Good morning everyone. My name is Jamie Crawford and I'll be giving you a brief
[00:04.280 --> 00:10.040]  update on our hemp, grain, and fiber trials. Our trial design is a randomized
[00:10.040 --> 00:14.760]  complete block where each entry is replicated four times. Plots are four
[00:14.760 --> 00:18.780]  feet wide and 20 feet long and seeding rate is calculated based on the
[00:18.780 --> 00:23.720]  germination rate and seed weight of each entry so that 20 live seeds are planted
[00:23.720 --> 00:28.480]  per square foot in the grain in dual trials and 40 live seeds are planted per
[00:28.480 --> 00:33.160]  square foot in the fiber trials. Complete hemp, grain, and fiber reports for each
[00:33.160 --> 00:36.720]  year can be found on our website but this graph shows the range of grain
[00:36.720 --> 00:42.920]  yields in Ithaca and Geneva by year. The yields for 2017 and 2019 were quite
[00:42.920 --> 00:47.920]  similar ranging from seven to eight hundred pounds per acre for the lower
[00:47.920 --> 00:51.720]  yielding entries to thirteen hundred to fourteen hundred pounds per acre in the
[00:51.720 --> 00:58.000]  higher yielding entries. Decrease in yield in 2018 was due to the timing of
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.920]  harvest. One location was harvested too early before grain was mature in all
[01:02.920 --> 01:07.440]  entries and one location was harvested too late with much of the grain lost to
[01:07.440 --> 01:12.840]  shattering our birds. When harvesting for grain timing is very important. Fiber
[01:12.840 --> 01:18.480]  yields in 2017 were low due to poor seed quality and very thin stands. With new
[01:18.480 --> 01:23.960]  higher germinating seed lots in 2018 and 2019 entries were yielding between five
[01:23.960 --> 01:28.000]  and six dry tons per acre before reading and two and a half to three and
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.160]  a half dry tons per acre after reading. We established grain and fiber trials in
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.840]  two locations this spring. The first in Geneva planted on June 4th and the
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.080]  second planted in Ithaca on June 6th. Ithaca had received six tenths of an
[01:43.080 --> 01:48.040]  inch more rain than Geneva in the two weeks leading up to planting and this
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.600]  made a huge difference in the success of the trials. Because the field was so dry
[01:53.640 --> 01:57.760]  when it was prepped for planting, hard baked chunks of soil limited seed soil
[01:57.760 --> 02:02.040]  contact. Had we received the predicted rain it could have been okay but the
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.080]  lack of rain in the weeks after planting led to poor emergence and then the trial
[02:06.080 --> 02:11.680]  was overrun by weeds. The additional soil moisture at the Ithaca location led to a
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.040]  finer seed bed, excellent emergence and what should have been an excellent stand
[02:16.040 --> 02:22.520]  if our cone seeder hadn't been slowly breaking as we were planting. While we
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.720]  were planting the Ithaca trials the load bar which supported the packer
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.080]  wheels was slowly twisting, planting some of the rows more deeply and packing the
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.760]  soil over top of them very firmly. We planted the fiber trial first that day
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.560]  and all six rows emerged but by the last plot planted that day only two rows
[02:39.560 --> 02:43.840]  emerged as expected. The planter was repaired and then the grain and dual
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.400]  purpose trials were replanted on June 24th. Since these hemp varieties are
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.400]  photoperiod sensitive, planting later leads to shorter plants. The tops of the
[02:53.400 --> 02:57.080]  signs in both pictures are 30 inches from the ground. Piccolo planted the
[02:57.080 --> 03:01.120]  beginning of June is close to four feet tall. Piccolo planted the end of June is
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.560]  two and a half feet tall. Canola is over five feet tall in the original planting
[03:05.560 --> 03:09.800]  and not quite four feet tall in the replant. We expect the grain yields to be
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.040]  similar between these trials but shorter entries are more susceptible to weed
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.640]  pressure. For my remaining time I'd like to show you some pictures of our trials
[03:19.640 --> 03:24.360]  here in Ithaca New York. We'll start out with the fiber trial. The fiber trial was
[03:24.360 --> 03:29.880]  planted on June 6th so it's from the original planting and has four entries.
[03:29.880 --> 03:35.440]  There are two new entries this year. The one on the left is called Yuma crossbow.
[03:35.440 --> 03:39.840]  We had some conflicting information on whether it should be included in the
[03:39.880 --> 03:44.080]  dual purpose or the fiber trial and as you can see here we made the wrong
[03:44.080 --> 03:51.200]  choice. It's actually earlier flowering than some of the entries in our dual
[03:51.200 --> 03:58.560]  purpose trials and we will be harvesting it for grain later this month. The other
[03:58.560 --> 04:05.960]  new entry this year is Jin Ma and it is a little bit later maturing than the
[04:05.960 --> 04:11.400]  Italian varieties we have in the trial as sort of our checks and it's looking
[04:11.400 --> 04:18.160]  really good so far. Our grain trial has eight entries starting on the left with
[04:18.160 --> 04:26.960]  X59. There's CRS-1 in the middle and Canda on the right. In this photo
[04:26.960 --> 04:33.240]  that's Canda again on the left followed by USO 31 in the middle and Hanola on
[04:33.240 --> 04:41.080]  the right. And then finally this photo has Piccolo on the left, Joey in the
[04:41.080 --> 04:51.880]  middle and CFX2 on the right. Our dual purpose trials has 15 entries this year.
[04:51.880 --> 05:02.760]  First there on the left you can see NWG Elite followed by NWG Abound and Felina 32.
[05:02.840 --> 05:17.490]  In the second slide you see Fedora 17, Vega and then Anka. This slide is Futura
[05:17.490 --> 05:28.000]  75 on the left, Felicia in the middle and Bia Jobredski on the right. This slide
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.760]  contains the variety we're calling H51 on the left, Hyliana in the center and
[05:34.800 --> 05:41.360]  Rigel on the right. The final three entries in our dual purpose trial are
[05:41.360 --> 05:50.410]  Altair on the left, Faramon in the middle and Voico on the right. I'm so
[05:50.410 --> 05:53.910]  disappointed that we can't be together in person to show off our trials
[05:53.910 --> 05:58.430]  properly. When we've held field days in the past I've noticed that people just
[05:58.430 --> 06:03.030]  cannot help but touch and smell the plants. I can't send the smells of the
[06:03.030 --> 06:07.230]  hemp field to you but here is a video of one of our technicians petting the
[06:07.230 --> 06:15.470]  hemp plots for you to enjoy vicariously. And with that I'll take any questions.
