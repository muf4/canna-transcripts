[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  This is a production of Cornell University.
[00:03.000 --> 00:11.210]  I'm Larry Smart. I'm a professor in the horticulture section of the School of
[00:11.210 --> 00:12.610]  Integrated Plant Science
[00:12.610 --> 00:15.730]  based here at Cornell Agritech in Geneva.
[00:15.730 --> 00:19.050]  So at Cornell we started hemp research
[00:19.050 --> 00:23.010]  in late 2016. We have been doing
[00:23.010 --> 00:26.290]  variety evaluations, assessment
[00:26.290 --> 00:30.050]  of disease threats and insect pest threats
[00:30.050 --> 00:34.290]  and doing some work on crop management,
[00:34.290 --> 00:38.490]  especially disease management and weed management.
[00:38.490 --> 00:42.050]  So with legalization of hemp
[00:42.050 --> 00:45.410]  in the 2014 Farm Bill, Cornell
[00:45.410 --> 00:49.450]  eagerly took up the challenge of starting to work on this crop
[00:49.450 --> 00:55.290]  that has not been studied for decades and has a high regulatory burden
[00:55.290 --> 00:59.610]  for us as researchers. We've been very fortunate
[00:59.610 --> 01:04.010]  at Cornell to have active engagement across multiple disciplines,
[01:04.010 --> 01:07.570]  to build a engaged
[01:07.570 --> 01:11.610]  and diverse team of researchers and extension specialists,
[01:11.610 --> 01:14.970]  including myself as a plant breeder,
[01:14.970 --> 01:20.530]  Joss Rose doing biochemistry of cannabinoids, which is critical
[01:20.530 --> 01:24.450]  to maintain compliance and to breed compliant cultivars,
[01:24.450 --> 01:28.210]  Chris Smart and Gary Bergstrom in plant pathology,
[01:28.970 --> 01:32.290]  evaluating disease threats and
[01:32.290 --> 01:36.250]  Neil Mattson working on controlled environment production.
[01:36.250 --> 01:39.290]  Most recently Lynn Sosnoski here
[01:39.290 --> 01:42.410]  at Cornell Agritech has joined our team working
[01:42.410 --> 01:46.650]  on herbicide efficacy and weed management.
[01:46.650 --> 01:51.090]  Alan Taylor is our seed scientist studying seed quality
[01:51.090 --> 01:56.730]  and working on seed coatings. We've been very fortunate to have
[01:56.890 --> 02:00.890]  a strong collaboration with New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets
[02:00.890 --> 02:04.210]  who has given us quite a bit of latitude
[02:04.210 --> 02:08.010]  for what I would call self-auditing
[02:08.010 --> 02:11.170]  and self-regulation and because of that
[02:11.170 --> 02:14.690]  I think we have been able to make some major breakthroughs
[02:14.690 --> 02:18.210]  in our understanding of the genetic basis of
[02:18.210 --> 02:22.890]  THC and CBD production which has contributed to
[02:22.890 --> 02:26.450]  rapid breeding for
[02:26.650 --> 02:30.970]  THC compliance and truly an understanding of the genetic basis
[02:30.970 --> 02:36.610]  for THC production and THC compliance in hemp crops.
[02:36.610 --> 02:39.690]  We have also gotten strong support
[02:39.690 --> 02:43.690]  from New York State with strong supporters in the legislature
[02:43.690 --> 02:47.570]  and the governor's office to initiate the first
[02:47.570 --> 02:50.770]  land-grant academic hemp breeding program.
[02:50.770 --> 02:55.970]  So we have been breeding hemp varieties, building a hemp germplasm collection
[02:56.010 --> 03:00.090]  and developing markers for marker-assisted selection
[03:00.090 --> 03:03.410]  since early 2017.
[03:03.410 --> 03:07.570]  Our phenotyping is largely based on the evaluation of current commercial
[03:07.570 --> 03:08.410]  cultivars
[03:08.410 --> 03:13.170]  in three market classes. We are very interested in developing
[03:13.170 --> 03:17.330]  new cultivars for grain production and the grain
[03:17.330 --> 03:21.090]  will meet a niche for
[03:21.090 --> 03:25.890]  animal feed, particularly organic animal feed. We see strong
[03:25.970 --> 03:26.690]  potential
[03:26.690 --> 03:29.690]  in the poultry market for hemp grain
[03:29.690 --> 03:33.890]  improving egg quality. It is a gluten-free
[03:33.890 --> 03:37.210]  feed so we see strong potential for
[03:37.210 --> 03:40.890]  beef and actually pet food
[03:40.890 --> 03:44.450]  production but
[03:44.450 --> 03:47.770]  it also is a source of
[03:47.770 --> 03:51.010]  protein and potential ingredient
[03:51.010 --> 03:54.890]  source for plant-based meats and
[03:55.610 --> 03:59.650]  it produces a very healthy oil
[03:59.650 --> 04:02.810]  which is also used in health
[04:02.810 --> 04:08.170]  and cosmetic products. So there is a strong potential to increase
[04:08.170 --> 04:13.490]  yield of grain production. We're also very interested in the fiber market
[04:13.490 --> 04:17.290]  and this field behind me is evaluation
[04:17.290 --> 04:21.290]  in strip trials of some fiber varieties from China
[04:21.970 --> 04:26.010]  which flower extremely late which makes them very good
[04:26.010 --> 04:30.810]  biomass and fiber producers. We see strong potential
[04:30.810 --> 04:34.170]  in fiber production not only
[04:34.170 --> 04:37.930]  for the long strong bass fibers which
[04:37.930 --> 04:41.050]  can go into technical applications
[04:41.050 --> 04:45.410]  reinforced panels, building materials,
[04:45.410 --> 04:48.570]  insulation materials for example, but also
[04:48.570 --> 04:51.730]  for the inner herd, the inner core
[04:51.730 --> 04:54.850]  of the stem which has potential
[04:54.850 --> 04:57.930]  again for construction materials in the form of hempcrete
[04:57.930 --> 05:01.970]  but also serves as a very good absorbent product
[05:01.970 --> 05:06.410]  for animal bedding and in fact that is one of the immediate products that has
[05:06.410 --> 05:06.930]  gone
[05:06.930 --> 05:10.370]  onto the market is for small
[05:10.370 --> 05:13.410]  animal bedding for your gerbil cage for example.
[05:13.410 --> 05:17.570]  A lot of potential for further development of products
[05:18.210 --> 05:22.130]  for example absorbent products for diapers,
[05:22.130 --> 05:25.810]  for environmental cleanup
[05:25.810 --> 05:29.530]  and other applications. So once we have sufficient
[05:29.530 --> 05:33.210]  agricultural production of hemp I think we're going to see
[05:33.210 --> 05:36.770]  great market expansion and diversification
[05:36.770 --> 05:40.930]  of the products that we can make both from the grain and from the stem.
[05:40.930 --> 05:44.730]  A lot of the hype around hemp has been based on the production
[05:44.730 --> 05:48.530]  of cannabinoids, primarily cannabidiol
[05:48.530 --> 05:51.610]  or CBD. So we saw
[05:51.610 --> 05:55.010]  a huge interest in 2019
[05:55.010 --> 05:58.050]  from farmers after
[05:58.050 --> 06:02.490]  cannabis sativa was taken off of schedule one, hemp was taken off of
[06:02.490 --> 06:03.570]  schedule one by the
[06:03.570 --> 06:06.770]  2018 Farm Bill. That
[06:06.770 --> 06:10.250]  released a lot of the regulatory
[06:10.370 --> 06:14.810]  issues and encouraged farmers to take up the production of hemp
[06:14.810 --> 06:18.490]  but that resulted in extreme overproduction.
[06:18.490 --> 06:21.690]  Estimates that we produced
[06:21.690 --> 06:24.810]  as much as four or five fold more
[06:24.810 --> 06:28.010]  biomass than the market could bear
[06:28.010 --> 06:31.450]  and in fact there are still growers who have material
[06:31.450 --> 06:35.010]  in storage that has not been fully processed
[06:35.010 --> 06:40.050]  from the 2019 growing season. So prices crashed
[06:40.050 --> 06:43.290]  and we see this sort of classic characteristic
[06:43.290 --> 06:47.930]  roller coaster ride of over enthusiasm,
[06:47.930 --> 06:51.370]  overproduction and then a crash of prices,
[06:51.370 --> 06:56.490]  disillusionment and now we're in the process
[06:56.490 --> 07:00.050]  of diversification of the market and
[07:00.050 --> 07:04.650]  re-engagement of growers as we continue to improve
[07:04.650 --> 07:10.010]  production practices and develop new varieties to meet those needs.
[07:10.650 --> 07:14.290]  So the Farm Bill authorized us to do research
[07:14.290 --> 07:17.370]  on hemp. Hemp and
[07:17.370 --> 07:20.970]  drug type cannabis are a single same species,
[07:20.970 --> 07:24.490]  cannabis sativa. In fact
[07:24.490 --> 07:28.130]  through some of our work we have identified that
[07:28.130 --> 07:31.610]  there's a rather simple genetic basis
[07:31.610 --> 07:34.810]  for either high THC production,
[07:34.810 --> 07:39.130]  relatively equal mixed production of THC
[07:39.130 --> 07:42.490]  and CBD or high CBD production.
[07:42.490 --> 07:46.850]  The interesting phenomenon that we've characterized in CBD hemp
[07:46.850 --> 07:50.210]  is that the enzyme CBD synthase
[07:50.210 --> 07:53.690]  also produces a certain amount
[07:53.690 --> 07:57.730]  of THC. So every CBD hemp plant
[07:57.730 --> 08:02.530]  also makes a little bit of THC. We at Cornell
[08:02.530 --> 08:06.250]  only work on hemp which is cannabis sativa
[08:06.410 --> 08:10.570]  that produces less than 0.3 percent THC.
[08:10.570 --> 08:15.570]  Those regulations have been a patchwork from state to state
[08:15.570 --> 08:19.570]  and again New York State has been
[08:19.570 --> 08:22.650]  a rather compliant state to grow hemp in
[08:22.650 --> 08:27.890]  because their regulations have been based on quantification of delta 9 THC
[08:27.890 --> 08:33.170]  rather than total THC. These are some of the complications and regulatory
[08:33.170 --> 08:34.530]  burdens that we face
[08:34.850 --> 08:40.170]  in working with hemp. We've also been very fortunate at Cornell Agrotech
[08:40.170 --> 08:44.130]  to receive strong support from USDA
[08:44.130 --> 08:48.930]  ARS and in fact through initiatives from Senator Schumer's office
[08:48.930 --> 08:52.490]  ARS decided to locate the new
[08:52.490 --> 08:55.650]  hemp germplasm repository at
[08:55.650 --> 09:00.850]  Cornell Agrotech in Geneva. So that will be a
[09:00.850 --> 09:03.850]  tremendous advantage for
[09:03.850 --> 09:07.490]  us in our breeding program to be able to work side by side
[09:07.490 --> 09:10.650]  with the curator of the germplasm collection
[09:10.650 --> 09:14.410]  and geneticists characterizing that collection.
[09:14.410 --> 09:18.610]  We will work with them to assemble material,
[09:18.610 --> 09:21.770]  make sure that it is compliant for THC
[09:21.770 --> 09:25.690]  so that it can be entered into the repository,
[09:25.690 --> 09:29.490]  scaled up and then distributed to hemp breeders.
[09:30.410 --> 09:33.570]  So for every other crop that
[09:33.570 --> 09:36.730]  academic and industrial breeders work on
[09:36.730 --> 09:41.090]  there is an extensive and well characterized germplasm collection
[09:41.090 --> 09:47.330]  that used to exist for hemp, was assembled back in the 1930s,
[09:47.330 --> 09:50.690]  20s and 30s but then was destroyed
[09:50.690 --> 09:54.050]  when hemp was put on the controlled substance list.
[09:54.050 --> 09:57.730]  So right now we face the process
[09:57.730 --> 10:00.930]  of reassembling a diverse
[10:00.930 --> 10:04.690]  germplasm collection and characterizing it using
[10:04.690 --> 10:07.650]  modern phenotyping and genotyping tools
[10:07.650 --> 10:12.010]  so that there is useful and diverse germplasm
[10:12.010 --> 10:16.610]  ongoing into the future for industrial and academic hemp breeders.
[10:16.610 --> 10:19.930]  So this is our fourth year of evaluating
[10:19.930 --> 10:24.050]  cannabinoid hemp varieties. In this trial behind me
[10:24.050 --> 10:32.050]  we have 40 different CBD and now cannabijerol, CBG varieties
[10:32.050 --> 10:35.290]  that we evaluate in small plots, five plant plots
[10:35.290 --> 10:38.090]  replicated four times in the field.
[10:38.090 --> 10:42.090]  We're using typical production practices
[10:42.090 --> 10:46.410]  for the Northeast which is to plant into raised beds
[10:46.410 --> 10:49.490]  with plastic mulch for weed management.
[10:49.490 --> 10:53.330]  We put down landscape fabric in the alleys
[10:53.330 --> 10:58.610]  so that we don't have to mow and also to provide a nice uniform background
[10:58.610 --> 11:04.690]  for drone imaging. So we will be doing active weekly drone imaging of this
[11:04.690 --> 11:10.530]  trial to be able to quantify nutrient status,
[11:10.530 --> 11:15.650]  any disease and pest incidents, initiation of flowering
[11:15.650 --> 11:21.730]  and to use lidar to estimate biomass production and yield.
[11:21.730 --> 11:25.010]  By evaluating these cultivars for the last four years
[11:25.010 --> 11:31.890]  actually we have identified trait segregation because the state of
[11:31.890 --> 11:35.490]  hemp breeding is still in its infancy for CBD
[11:35.490 --> 11:40.290]  production in the U.S. So actually many of the quote unquote
[11:40.290 --> 11:45.010]  cultivars that we have evaluated have been segregating, some of them
[11:45.010 --> 11:50.610]  segregating dramatically for single major gene traits
[11:50.610 --> 11:57.010]  such as flowering time. So we have been able to map
[11:57.010 --> 12:04.370]  and identify candidate genes that determine day neutrality. Hemp is
[12:04.370 --> 12:09.650]  a short day plant but does have some variants that are day neutral
[12:09.650 --> 12:13.410]  that will flower after a certain maturity date.
[12:13.410 --> 12:17.890]  So that is a simple single gene recessive trait
[12:17.890 --> 12:24.530]  that is segregating three to one in F2 populations. We are also very
[12:24.530 --> 12:28.370]  interested in mapping genes for powdery mildew resistance.
[12:28.370 --> 12:32.050]  Powdery mildew is one of the diseases that
[12:32.050 --> 12:38.450]  has been most abundant, most prevalent in the northeast and in New York. It's
[12:38.450 --> 12:42.450]  also an important pathogen in controlled environment
[12:42.450 --> 12:47.010]  production. So if we can identify genes and
[12:47.010 --> 12:51.890]  molecular markers to intergress powdery mildew resistance it would have a
[12:51.890 --> 12:57.010]  big impact on the industry. We by evaluating cultivars year after
[12:57.010 --> 13:01.570]  year with Chris Smart and her lab doing the powdery
[13:01.570 --> 13:05.010]  mildew evaluations and characterizing powdery mildew
[13:05.010 --> 13:08.770]  populations, we have been able to identify some
[13:08.770 --> 13:13.410]  varieties that show consistent strong resistance
[13:13.410 --> 13:17.410]  and have developed F2 mapping populations which we have in the field
[13:17.410 --> 13:22.290]  this year, hopefully to identify genes for either
[13:22.290 --> 13:26.690]  susceptibility or resistance to powdery mildew.
[13:26.690 --> 13:30.450]  We will also be sequencing the Golovinomyces
[13:30.450 --> 13:35.970]  genome once we can get sufficient high quality DNA.
[13:35.970 --> 13:41.250]  So in addition to mapping major genes for powdery mildew resistance
[13:41.330 --> 13:47.810]  and for the day neutral trait, we are very interested in quantifying the
[13:47.810 --> 13:52.850]  quantitative differences in critical day length.
[13:52.850 --> 14:00.130]  So there is quite a bit of variation in flowering time from late July,
[14:00.130 --> 14:06.770]  early August through early October which will be represents
[14:06.770 --> 14:13.330]  adaptation to different latitudes and being able to develop cultivars with
[14:13.330 --> 14:17.410]  the proper critical day length and flowering time
[14:17.410 --> 14:21.490]  sensitivity for different latitudes is a big issue
[14:21.490 --> 14:24.770]  right now. For example there is a lot of interest
[14:24.770 --> 14:31.570]  in the southeast and in Texas in fiber production, but most of the
[14:31.570 --> 14:35.570]  fiber varieties have been developed at northerly latitudes
[14:35.570 --> 14:40.770]  so they flower very early when we bring them to southern latitudes.
[14:40.770 --> 14:48.850]  Also there are tropical countries that have been growing fiber hemp forever
[14:48.850 --> 14:52.930]  but do not have access to high CBD hemp which have been
[14:52.930 --> 14:58.450]  developed by crossing hemp with high THC cannabis and then
[14:58.450 --> 15:04.210]  selecting for high CBD production in those effectively hybrids.
[15:04.210 --> 15:11.090]  So there are folks at equatorial latitudes that are very
[15:11.090 --> 15:17.650]  interested in having high CBD hemp which can grow on a 12 hour 12 hour
[15:17.650 --> 15:22.770]  cycle. That's a problem that we have not solved yet.
[15:22.770 --> 15:26.050]  Another trait that we're very interested in characterizing
[15:26.050 --> 15:29.890]  is the relationship of cannabinoid production
[15:29.890 --> 15:37.170]  to insect damage and it has long been theorized that
[15:37.170 --> 15:44.530]  hemp produces cannabinoids THC and CBD potentially for insect defense. We have
[15:44.530 --> 15:49.010]  a little bit of insight into that because there are cannabinoid free
[15:49.010 --> 15:53.170]  grain and fiber cultivars and we have seen
[15:53.170 --> 15:56.850]  that those particular cultivars seem to be
[15:56.850 --> 16:02.610]  heavily damaged by herbivory from Japanese beetle.
[16:02.610 --> 16:09.890]  So this observation has led us to test the hypothesis that
[16:09.890 --> 16:13.090]  the production of cannabinoids plays a role
[16:13.090 --> 16:20.450]  in pest interactions perhaps as a defensive agent or perhaps in
[16:20.450 --> 16:27.490]  the deterrence of pests from herbivory. We have developed a mapping population
[16:27.490 --> 16:31.970]  that has variation in cannabinoid production. Some plants
[16:31.970 --> 16:36.770]  are cannabinoid competent, some are cannabinoid deficient and we
[16:36.770 --> 16:42.450]  have planted those on multiple sites and will survey for
[16:42.450 --> 16:51.750]  relative damage by insect pests in the field.
[16:51.750 --> 16:55.190]  This has been a production of Cornell University
[16:55.190 --> 16:59.910]  on the web at cornell.edu.
