[00:00.510 --> 00:01.510]  Twin Peaks.
[00:01.510 --> 00:02.510]  Oh, wow.
[00:02.510 --> 00:19.280]  All right, everybody, welcome to a very special edition of the Friendly Cannabis Show today.
[00:19.280 --> 00:27.440]  We've got the guy who is responsible for my favorite cannabis book in the world.
[00:27.440 --> 00:28.440]  This is the one.
[00:28.440 --> 00:31.700]  I'm like, if you need one book, get this and you're done.
[00:31.700 --> 00:34.380]  But enough about that.
[00:34.380 --> 00:36.340]  Jorge Cervantes, welcome.
[00:36.340 --> 00:37.900]  Thank you for making time to be here.
[00:37.900 --> 00:39.660]  Hey, thank you.
[00:39.660 --> 00:40.660]  Thank you.
[00:40.660 --> 00:41.660]  It's a pleasure.
[00:41.660 --> 00:45.020]  I'm glad to be here.
[00:45.020 --> 00:47.460]  You know, it's a good deal.
[00:47.460 --> 00:50.780]  I'm finally out, kind of like out of hiding.
[00:50.780 --> 00:57.380]  You know, I've been out doing stuff recently and stuff because I got this new book out,
[00:57.380 --> 00:58.380]  We Grow Cannabis.
[00:59.380 --> 01:00.380]  It's digital.
[01:00.380 --> 01:04.980]  It's my first foray into digital stuff.
[01:04.980 --> 01:11.940]  I had a digital book, you know, I mean, well, Kindle books on Amazon, but this is completely
[01:11.940 --> 01:13.700]  digital and it's free.
[01:13.700 --> 01:16.940]  It's free, like 100 pages, all free and stuff.
[01:16.940 --> 01:20.060]  So that's a good deal.
[01:20.060 --> 01:21.060]  And there's, yeah.
[01:21.060 --> 01:27.020]  Well, I don't know, I could go through it and tell you all about it.
[01:27.020 --> 01:29.900]  Well, if you download it, then you'll know.
[01:29.900 --> 01:30.900]  Exactly.
[01:30.900 --> 01:32.940]  Here's what it looks like, everybody.
[01:32.940 --> 01:38.740]  We've got that and we've got the link to where to download this in the show description notes
[01:38.740 --> 01:39.860]  as well.
[01:39.860 --> 01:44.340]  So that's a little banner, but if you're not writing it down, just go into the show notes.
[01:44.340 --> 01:46.780]  It's down there.
[01:46.780 --> 01:49.700]  But so how did that come about?
[01:49.700 --> 01:53.980]  What was the inspiration or motivation to say, you know what, we need to do a digital
[01:53.980 --> 01:56.260]  book and we need to do it for free?
[01:56.500 --> 02:02.260]  Well, that was kind of weird for me to begin to think to give away free books because I
[02:02.260 --> 02:04.500]  made my whole income on books, right?
[02:04.500 --> 02:08.100]  But, you know, nobody buys books anymore.
[02:08.100 --> 02:11.540]  So what happened was during COVID, I didn't know what else to do.
[02:11.540 --> 02:19.460]  So I started writing to rewrite the Horticulture book because it hasn't been edited for 16
[02:19.460 --> 02:20.460]  years.
[02:20.460 --> 02:24.300]  So I figured I better catch it up to date.
[02:24.340 --> 02:27.780]  And then I did that and then it expanded.
[02:27.780 --> 02:32.580]  I thought, oh, my gosh, how am I going to how's this going to work out for money and
[02:32.580 --> 02:33.580]  stuff?
[02:33.580 --> 02:43.100]  I mean, because the transport went up, goes up and goes down, up, takes longer to do everything.
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.860]  You know, the transport takes longer.
[02:44.860 --> 02:45.860]  You've got to store it.
[02:45.860 --> 02:48.900]  All of those costs went up.
[02:48.900 --> 02:52.820]  And then the market went soft because the Internet is so strong.
[02:52.820 --> 02:58.540]  So I didn't really figure all of this stuff out until later.
[02:58.540 --> 03:06.660]  And then I was I was talking to my buddy Tom over there at the Seedsman from the UK.
[03:06.660 --> 03:08.020]  Comes down to Spain and stuff.
[03:08.020 --> 03:09.020]  We've been talking.
[03:09.020 --> 03:10.020]  Oh, well, we've known each other.
[03:10.020 --> 03:13.060]  I'm like, I know a bunch of people here.
[03:13.060 --> 03:22.060]  Anyway, he said, look, if we release this together, you can use the power of my mailing
[03:22.300 --> 03:31.660]  list and my publicity and I can I can advertise there and we can both get on better.
[03:31.660 --> 03:35.100]  I thought, OK, that sounds like an OK deal.
[03:35.100 --> 03:41.380]  So in order to test that, what we did is we make a hundred page book and just make it
[03:41.380 --> 03:43.540]  into a PDF.
[03:43.540 --> 03:45.740]  And so it's downloadable and everything.
[03:45.740 --> 03:49.780]  And this this edition, it's in English.
[03:49.780 --> 03:55.620]  And then the next edition will make will actually I'm translating it now.
[03:55.620 --> 04:04.060]  It should be done and finished by the first of February and, you know, completed and and
[04:04.060 --> 04:05.380]  yeah, on the mark.
[04:05.380 --> 04:10.340]  Well, on the market, it's on link and it's free.
[04:10.340 --> 04:11.340]  Yeah.
[04:11.340 --> 04:14.660]  So that's how it all started.
[04:14.660 --> 04:17.260]  And ultimately, I'm going to do more stuff.
[04:17.260 --> 04:19.540]  I'm not I don't want to talk about that.
[04:19.740 --> 04:25.340]  Because, well, people ask about things and I haven't really figured it out yet.
[04:25.340 --> 04:30.500]  So I better I better get it straight first before I talk about anything.
[04:30.820 --> 04:34.220]  But yeah, that's how this all came about, to be honest.
[04:34.620 --> 04:38.980]  And it's well, you can see, oh, yeah, this is a good thing.
[04:39.260 --> 04:44.740]  You can click on like, for example, botanical classification, click on that and you go
[04:44.740 --> 04:46.420]  right to that part of the book.
[04:46.580 --> 04:47.780]  Oh, wow.
[04:47.780 --> 04:49.700]  I haven't even discovered that part yet.
[04:50.380 --> 04:51.060]  That's fun.
[04:52.060 --> 04:54.260]  Yeah. So you go right there.
[04:54.300 --> 04:55.540]  That's really a good deal.
[04:55.900 --> 05:00.020]  And then also there's a find search function.
[05:00.020 --> 05:05.620]  You know, you just go control F and then you can find anything you want.
[05:06.940 --> 05:13.140]  If you want, you know, you can search for a character string or a word or or all kinds
[05:13.140 --> 05:14.340]  of stuff. Yeah.
[05:14.820 --> 05:17.420]  So it's it's easy to navigate.
[05:18.260 --> 05:20.180]  That's that's a real good deal.
[05:20.620 --> 05:28.900]  And then another thing about it is I have two co-authors now that they came on later.
[05:28.900 --> 05:31.140]  But I'll tell you, it's really a good deal.
[05:31.700 --> 05:32.740]  You can see him up here.
[05:32.740 --> 05:35.740]  Yeah. In the middle, there's that's that's Gary.
[05:36.740 --> 05:38.700]  This is Scottish, right?
[05:39.380 --> 05:42.580]  Or he tones the language down for us.
[05:42.620 --> 05:46.060]  I mean, God, it's just hard as hell to understand.
[05:46.060 --> 05:48.340]  It starts doing that Scottish stuff.
[05:48.700 --> 05:53.700]  It's you know, you get him around people that aren't Scottish and he's OK.
[05:54.580 --> 05:59.860]  It takes a while, but I don't have to ask him to repeat a few times.
[06:00.380 --> 06:02.260]  He's really good with the written word, though.
[06:02.300 --> 06:05.220]  Really good. But man, yeah.
[06:05.220 --> 06:07.780]  But he's got a doctor's degree in microbiology.
[06:07.780 --> 06:10.500]  See, and he just one of those guys.
[06:10.740 --> 06:14.620]  He doesn't look like it, but he's like full on nerd science man.
[06:14.620 --> 06:17.020]  I mean, you know, inside out.
[06:17.460 --> 06:25.420]  And it's he's really a brilliant guy and very easygoing, easy to get along with.
[06:25.980 --> 06:29.860]  And yeah, and he works and he's up there in the UK.
[06:30.220 --> 06:32.980]  And then the guy on the right is Stefan Meyer.
[06:33.300 --> 06:36.420]  I've known him for oh, for a long, long time, for years.
[06:36.420 --> 06:38.580]  He's Swiss guy. OK.
[06:38.580 --> 06:44.660]  And he's been going to every every scientific conference.
[06:45.340 --> 06:49.260]  And God, for the last, I don't know, 15 years, probably.
[06:50.020 --> 06:52.340]  It's about when they started heavy.
[06:52.340 --> 06:55.860]  And also, well, he's in Colombia now.
[06:55.860 --> 06:58.220]  I mean, he went over to America.
[06:58.220 --> 06:59.060]  He was at that.
[07:00.620 --> 07:03.020]  Was that MJ BizCon
[07:04.340 --> 07:06.020]  for us? Yeah.
[07:06.020 --> 07:07.540]  Yeah. We're working together.
[07:07.540 --> 07:12.100]  And then now he's I don't know, he's in Bogota, I think right now.
[07:12.620 --> 07:16.340]  Yeah, he was because he was overseeing Mauricio and those guys.
[07:16.820 --> 07:22.060]  So, yeah. Anyway, that's always impressive.
[07:22.380 --> 07:25.380]  He he talks always also six languages.
[07:25.820 --> 07:28.740]  Oh, my gosh. That is really well.
[07:30.380 --> 07:34.060]  You know, when I went to the Netherlands, it's and talking with the people there.
[07:34.060 --> 07:36.900]  I mean, obviously in Amsterdam, English is all you need.
[07:36.900 --> 07:41.580]  But they learn three languages, you know, Dutch, American and German
[07:41.580 --> 07:43.140]  and as part of their school.
[07:43.140 --> 07:46.580]  And many of them speak more as a person who speaks
[07:46.580 --> 07:49.460]  one language and little bits of two others.
[07:49.820 --> 07:52.380]  Yeah. Yeah. It just blows my mind.
[07:52.380 --> 07:54.900]  Yeah. It kind of depends on where you grew up.
[07:55.380 --> 07:58.980]  See, if you if you grew up further south, you also taught French.
[07:59.580 --> 08:04.100]  And closer to the borders, you know, so if you're over close to the German border
[08:04.540 --> 08:07.700]  and then the television makes a big influence, too,
[08:07.700 --> 08:11.380]  because many programs are in English, the two big languages
[08:11.380 --> 08:14.140]  or the English and German. Yeah.
[08:16.180 --> 08:19.740]  Yeah. Oddly enough, when we were back there in May,
[08:20.140 --> 08:23.700]  it seems like Friends, the show Friends is making the rounds
[08:23.820 --> 08:24.820]  over in the Netherlands.
[08:24.820 --> 08:29.460]  Now we saw it was on like so many channels, like T-shirts, like merchandise.
[08:29.460 --> 08:31.500]  Friends is taken over.
[08:31.540 --> 08:34.060]  Oh, my God. Oh, I know.
[08:34.860 --> 08:36.260]  Too funny. Yeah. Yeah.
[08:36.260 --> 08:39.540]  The all of all of that's it's so different.
[08:40.700 --> 08:45.620]  But the American television's permeated a lot of stuff here. Yeah.
[08:45.860 --> 08:47.260]  Yeah. Yeah. By Jay.
[08:47.260 --> 08:50.740]  You know, I tried learning through the TV, but it's just too darn fast for me.
[08:50.740 --> 08:55.980]  So I got to resort back to my little tablet and do a lingo.
[08:56.460 --> 08:58.500]  Yeah. You can put the subtitles in.
[08:58.980 --> 09:01.500]  Oh, that works pretty well.
[09:01.500 --> 09:04.140]  And most everything has subtitles. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[09:04.180 --> 09:05.620]  Here's this. Yeah.
[09:05.620 --> 09:09.220]  And I did one just like this in Spanish.
[09:10.100 --> 09:13.140]  That's going to is talking about the translation.
[09:13.620 --> 09:15.780]  Yeah. Yeah. So
[09:17.340 --> 09:17.940]  this is it.
[09:17.940 --> 09:20.020]  We can show a little bit of the inside of the book.
[09:20.020 --> 09:22.620]  Is it is that possible? Yeah, absolutely.
[09:22.620 --> 09:25.300]  Let me I'll flip the screen here
[09:25.580 --> 09:30.300]  because, you know, one thing I've definitely I've read the encyclopedia.
[09:30.300 --> 09:33.300]  I've read the other books and I was able to skim through this the other night
[09:33.300 --> 09:35.340]  because I was just able to download it.
[09:37.260 --> 09:40.660]  And, you know, one thing that I cater to
[09:40.900 --> 09:44.860]  or like on my personal channel is I'm really about new growers.
[09:44.860 --> 09:46.420]  I want to get people growing.
[09:46.420 --> 09:51.180]  I don't necessarily care whether you're, you know, organic or salt
[09:51.660 --> 09:55.620]  salt based at the moment, because I'm very passionate about the plant,
[09:55.620 --> 09:58.100]  what it's done for my life and what it can do for other people.
[09:58.500 --> 10:01.100]  So getting people growing is awesome.
[10:01.820 --> 10:04.500]  A lot of people on this channel, they're past that.
[10:04.500 --> 10:07.980]  They're, you know, the intermediate to actual like commercial growers,
[10:07.980 --> 10:10.380]  people who do this on a professional level.
[10:10.380 --> 10:14.300]  One thing that I, you know, do enjoy about your book is you're able to hit
[10:14.300 --> 10:18.340]  both of these people or both of these statements because they are different,
[10:18.420 --> 10:20.540]  but similar enough.
[10:20.820 --> 10:23.100]  But yeah, I'll pull the book up here for you.
[10:23.100 --> 10:24.540]  Right. Thank you.
[10:24.540 --> 10:27.900]  Yeah, it's pretty hard to write to two audiences like that.
[10:27.900 --> 10:33.100]  It really is because you've got to keep everybody right with you.
[10:35.260 --> 10:38.300]  Yeah, it's a table of contents here for you.
[10:38.860 --> 10:40.220]  But yeah, you know, there's
[10:41.740 --> 10:43.580]  the depth of it again.
[10:43.580 --> 10:46.460]  It's nice that your co-authors, you know, they they look like,
[10:46.660 --> 10:50.180]  you know, party hardy good people, but in reality,
[10:50.180 --> 10:53.860]  we're all just kind of soil nerds and doing our thing.
[10:54.740 --> 10:57.700]  You know, and actually both those guys, they're real good guys.
[10:57.700 --> 10:59.700]  They're you know, they hit it hard.
[10:59.700 --> 11:04.740]  Don't get me wrong, but but the deal is there's just smart guys.
[11:04.740 --> 11:08.380]  And, you know, they like what they're doing.
[11:09.740 --> 11:11.740]  That's really what it comes down to.
[11:11.740 --> 11:14.180]  And they're hard workers of.
[11:15.180 --> 11:16.180]  Yeah.
[11:16.180 --> 11:17.100]  Yeah.
[11:17.100 --> 11:21.380]  And Gary is really good with the with the science and chemistry
[11:21.380 --> 11:24.900]  in the chemistry is like, you know, like it's one of those guys
[11:24.900 --> 11:27.140]  knows that stuff upside down and backwards.
[11:27.140 --> 11:29.260]  He understands all the little details.
[11:30.620 --> 11:32.740]  Yeah. Mind baffling to me.
[11:32.740 --> 11:35.260]  Oh, yeah. Also quite the musician.
[11:36.340 --> 11:37.900]  Yeah. OK. Me.
[11:37.900 --> 11:41.180]  That's actually my background is audio engineering.
[11:41.180 --> 11:43.700]  And I spent, you know, many years in music.
[11:43.700 --> 11:46.300]  And I've kind of transitions.
[11:47.100 --> 11:49.420]  Well, cannabis has always been a part of my life.
[11:49.420 --> 11:53.220]  But, you know, the music side is a little less these days
[11:53.220 --> 11:55.660]  and the cannabis side a little bit more.
[11:55.660 --> 11:58.220]  So good. Yeah.
[11:58.260 --> 11:59.060]  That's how we're doing it.
[11:59.060 --> 12:01.380]  So, you know, it doesn't surprise me again.
[12:02.100 --> 12:05.220]  Something that I love about music and gardening all the same
[12:05.460 --> 12:07.340]  is you're never going to know it all.
[12:07.340 --> 12:09.180]  There's always something new that you could do.
[12:09.180 --> 12:11.460]  You just have to figure out that you can do it.
[12:11.460 --> 12:12.980]  Always learning. Always.
[12:13.100 --> 12:14.740]  Always. Yeah. Yeah.
[12:14.740 --> 12:18.740]  And so, you know, it's really important that people get a good botanical
[12:19.060 --> 12:21.740]  background, just really basic stuff.
[12:22.060 --> 12:26.380]  But it's really important that, you know, the base and how stuff classified
[12:26.740 --> 12:29.180]  because it keeps you from getting confused later
[12:29.180 --> 12:32.980]  because people are pretty good at confusing you.
[12:33.380 --> 12:37.780]  You know, I mean, just because usually they don't mean to.
[12:37.780 --> 12:40.100]  They just don't understand themselves.
[12:40.100 --> 12:42.780]  So that's why it's confusing.
[12:42.780 --> 12:45.740]  It is. And we get a lot of the terminology wrong.
[12:45.740 --> 12:48.620]  I was you know, I've said this on different shows.
[12:48.620 --> 12:49.860]  This will be the third day in a row.
[12:49.860 --> 12:54.220]  But you have, you know, regular botany and then you have cannabis botany.
[12:54.860 --> 12:58.460]  You know, it's like stigma versus pistol, brack versus calyx.
[12:58.900 --> 13:03.020]  But if you say the one or the other, everybody knows what you're talking about,
[13:03.020 --> 13:05.740]  which is good, but also the problem at the same time.
[13:05.740 --> 13:11.540]  So bringing in clarification like this is great, especially as we advance,
[13:11.540 --> 13:15.820]  you know, and as the industry advances, there's a lot of smart people
[13:15.820 --> 13:19.380]  who may have never touched the plant, but they know all about it.
[13:19.620 --> 13:22.020]  We need to be able to use the same words.
[13:22.420 --> 13:23.260]  Yeah, exactly.
[13:23.260 --> 13:25.980]  Everybody should use the same terms to mean the same thing.
[13:26.300 --> 13:28.980]  That's it. That's what makes the language precise.
[13:30.420 --> 13:30.980]  Yes.
[13:32.700 --> 13:35.620]  Yeah, that photo that was taken in Thailand.
[13:35.620 --> 13:37.500]  Yeah, I think Thailand. OK.
[13:38.660 --> 13:40.100]  Now that that's one thing.
[13:40.140 --> 13:41.420]  Somewhere else I can't remember.
[13:41.420 --> 13:42.140]  I don't know where.
[13:43.180 --> 13:44.900]  I'll have to look twice.
[13:44.900 --> 13:47.020]  That's one thing that I always,
[13:48.180 --> 13:53.140]  you know, every picture of you is just in this like field of dreams
[13:53.140 --> 13:57.100]  is what I would call it, because you're surrounded by these towering plants
[13:57.100 --> 14:00.500]  around you, predominantly outdoors.
[14:00.500 --> 14:03.660]  Is that what you you go and look at or study?
[14:03.780 --> 14:07.580]  Well, you know, I live here in Spain and
[14:07.620 --> 14:14.220]  we just don't have as much cannabis growing as you guys do over there in America.
[14:14.700 --> 14:20.700]  And this summer I went to to Washington, Oregon, California.
[14:20.940 --> 14:25.020]  Yes. And so just I mean, more cannabis than you.
[14:25.060 --> 14:26.660]  I mean, it was amazing.
[14:26.660 --> 14:28.860]  I never saw so much in my life, really.
[14:28.980 --> 14:30.540]  And I've seen a lot.
[14:30.540 --> 14:36.140]  Trust me. And, you know, in Latin America and also also in Switzerland.
[14:36.620 --> 14:39.540]  But never so much as in the United States.
[14:40.460 --> 14:47.140]  You know, a few years ago I saw fields of of canoe and do you know the him him?
[14:47.380 --> 14:51.700]  But I didn't see this much drug cannabis.
[14:52.380 --> 14:56.260]  And one of my friends is managing the Los Alamos farms.
[14:56.740 --> 15:01.420]  It's a hundred acres, a hundred acres of cannabis.
[15:01.420 --> 15:04.260]  Yeah, it's most of it's a raised bed,
[15:04.260 --> 15:08.620]  raised beds, a little bit of it's small portions in containers.
[15:09.180 --> 15:10.100]  But that's a lot.
[15:10.100 --> 15:13.980]  You know, it takes a long time just to drive through that drive.
[15:13.980 --> 15:15.740]  Not one. Yeah.
[15:16.260 --> 15:19.140]  Yeah. And so I'm just not used to that.
[15:20.380 --> 15:24.900]  But I'll tell you, up in up in northern or over in northern
[15:24.900 --> 15:29.260]  California and Humboldt County, more specifically in southern Oregon,
[15:30.100 --> 15:34.620]  they were growing really big plants, have been for a long, long time.
[15:35.980 --> 15:39.820]  And now everybody just loves big plants.
[15:39.820 --> 15:42.100]  So I would hang out with those guys a lot.
[15:44.900 --> 15:46.020]  Big plants are great.
[15:46.020 --> 15:48.060]  And these are some of the coolest photos.
[15:48.060 --> 15:50.340]  They're from a Gunzo photo.
[15:51.620 --> 15:55.500]  Man, this this guy is really, really good.
[15:55.940 --> 15:58.540]  His name, you can get his name in the credits and stuff.
[15:58.540 --> 16:01.020]  But it's just unbelievable work.
[16:01.060 --> 16:03.140]  Very, very incredible close up stuff.
[16:03.540 --> 16:06.820]  There's some really good, really good photography in this book.
[16:07.820 --> 16:11.180]  That's something that has definitely been advancing,
[16:11.180 --> 16:15.660]  you know, along with the technology we use, you know, the technology
[16:15.900 --> 16:19.540]  like Jeff Lowenfelds, a lot of the people that he reports on
[16:19.540 --> 16:22.860]  and the gardening practices he reports on
[16:23.300 --> 16:25.420]  is because of advancements in technology.
[16:25.420 --> 16:27.660]  We're able to see smaller. We're able to see deeper.
[16:27.660 --> 16:30.460]  We can see inside the tissue cell walls now.
[16:31.500 --> 16:33.460]  I love seeing these things.
[16:34.060 --> 16:37.300]  Right. He says Jeff's a real good friend.
[16:37.900 --> 16:41.220]  And he's he's so funny.
[16:41.220 --> 16:43.860]  He's really interesting guy. Super interesting.
[16:44.940 --> 16:48.500]  I mean, he's another one of those people with just a passion for it.
[16:48.500 --> 16:50.900]  I had the honor of talking with him a couple of months ago
[16:51.220 --> 16:52.740]  before his new book came out.
[16:52.740 --> 16:54.180]  And you know what?
[16:54.180 --> 16:57.260]  If you can't be excited about it after listening to him,
[16:57.260 --> 16:59.460]  I don't know what is wrong with you.
[16:59.460 --> 17:01.220]  Now, the guy is amazing.
[17:01.220 --> 17:05.020]  He's see, we know each other from like from 20 years
[17:05.340 --> 17:08.340]  from the Garden Writers Association.
[17:08.660 --> 17:10.220]  That's how we met.
[17:10.220 --> 17:12.980]  We met at the Garden Writers Association.
[17:12.980 --> 17:18.420]  Yeah. Kim and Tom Alexander from Cintamia Tips.
[17:18.540 --> 17:20.580]  Yes. Yeah. We would always all hang.
[17:20.580 --> 17:22.420]  All three of us hang out together.
[17:22.420 --> 17:24.420]  Los tres amigos somos que amamos.
[17:24.460 --> 17:26.380]  And yeah, we'll see.
[17:26.380 --> 17:28.100]  Three, three sermones.
[17:28.100 --> 17:29.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:29.220 --> 17:32.620]  And well, three amigos, those little anyway.
[17:33.820 --> 17:36.340]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[17:37.340 --> 17:40.540]  He used to be the the
[17:41.700 --> 17:44.380]  assistant attorney general, assistant
[17:44.380 --> 17:48.500]  attorney general of Alaska, the state of Alaska.
[17:49.220 --> 17:53.900]  And yeah, he's got an incredible history, but he's he's got a really good
[17:54.940 --> 17:57.420]  science background.
[17:57.420 --> 18:00.180]  Incredibly good. Yeah. Yeah.
[18:00.180 --> 18:02.500]  And he's like a lifetime gardener.
[18:02.940 --> 18:06.300]  He grew up on the East Coast and they had like
[18:06.740 --> 18:10.340]  I was about a half an acre of vegetable garden.
[18:10.700 --> 18:12.580]  That's good. Yeah.
[18:12.580 --> 18:16.180]  Oh, the guy is like a total junkie garden junkie.
[18:17.460 --> 18:19.980]  It's crazy like that.
[18:19.980 --> 18:21.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[18:21.700 --> 18:24.060]  I, you know, I definitely like his style.
[18:24.060 --> 18:26.500]  And that's cool because I was curious about that.
[18:26.500 --> 18:29.780]  You know, there's, you know, Tom Alexander,
[18:30.900 --> 18:34.460]  Seattle, Greg and folks like him and
[18:36.260 --> 18:37.100]  Tom Hill.
[18:37.100 --> 18:40.500]  There's there's, you know, like 10, 20 people names that,
[18:40.500 --> 18:44.100]  you know, pretty much a lot of us people coming into it
[18:44.100 --> 18:47.820]  after you guys have made your impression that we all know these names.
[18:47.820 --> 18:50.380]  And I always wondered, it's like, how did you guys meet?
[18:50.380 --> 18:53.900]  Because I imagine at the time it wasn't like, hey, this is what I do
[18:53.900 --> 18:56.060]  as a hobby. What do you do?
[18:56.060 --> 18:58.540]  But it was all through everything.
[18:58.700 --> 19:01.380]  Everything was underground kind of like,
[19:02.020 --> 19:04.420]  but you could get together with a few people.
[19:04.420 --> 19:06.780]  There was smaller amount.
[19:06.780 --> 19:08.740]  There was a lot fewer people.
[19:08.740 --> 19:11.380]  And it's kind of like everybody knew everybody else.
[19:11.980 --> 19:15.220]  Back then we had hydroponic
[19:15.740 --> 19:18.300]  hydroponic association conventions.
[19:18.900 --> 19:19.980]  That was what we did.
[19:19.980 --> 19:21.340]  Yeah, we all had.
[19:21.340 --> 19:26.780]  And then we had the the Merchants Association later,
[19:27.180 --> 19:29.260]  hydroponic Merchants Association.
[19:29.740 --> 19:34.860]  So those but, you know, like the fucking DEA infiltrated those two.
[19:35.180 --> 19:37.380]  You know, they would come to the meetings. Yeah, sure.
[19:38.100 --> 19:41.540]  You know, they didn't.
[19:41.620 --> 19:42.660]  They didn't.
[19:42.660 --> 19:44.140]  They were there. They were there.
[19:44.140 --> 19:47.020]  But they didn't you didn't see them long term.
[19:47.020 --> 19:49.140]  They'd come and then go and come and go.
[19:49.940 --> 19:52.220]  But so that's what we had.
[19:52.860 --> 19:56.260]  But a lot there was a lot of paranoia,
[19:56.900 --> 19:58.780]  a heck of a lot of paranoia.
[19:58.780 --> 20:01.940]  See, there was. Oh, yeah.
[20:04.220 --> 20:07.300]  Because you couldn't talk about it in public.
[20:08.620 --> 20:10.620]  It was very it was it was dangerous.
[20:10.620 --> 20:12.620]  Yeah. Yeah. Dangerous.
[20:13.500 --> 20:18.180]  First, like in the early 80s, nobody really knew what it was.
[20:18.740 --> 20:25.300]  And then about the about mid to late 80s, late 80s, late 80s.
[20:25.300 --> 20:26.620]  Yeah, they figured it out.
[20:26.620 --> 20:30.660]  And by the 90s, the cops knew all about growing inside
[20:31.780 --> 20:33.780]  because before they really didn't.
[20:33.780 --> 20:36.300]  There was a time when they didn't.
[20:36.300 --> 20:39.980]  And that's everybody would use how light lights,
[20:40.020 --> 20:42.100]  how light lights and those Chinese
[20:43.660 --> 20:45.580]  reflect China, China,
[20:45.700 --> 20:47.980]  say column or cone reflectors.
[20:48.020 --> 20:49.860]  Yeah. Yeah.
[20:50.340 --> 20:54.740]  And since Amelia tips was really kind of from what I understand
[20:54.740 --> 20:57.980]  was like pushing the the advancement of knowledge
[20:57.980 --> 21:01.460]  kind of in an underground way to these growers, bringing things
[21:01.460 --> 21:04.340]  kind of like see if green and a few other techniques.
[21:04.340 --> 21:09.740]  But that was, you know, that was different than high times at that point.
[21:10.260 --> 21:13.820]  Oh, much different. It was more grow in oriented.
[21:14.340 --> 21:18.020]  High Times had the advertising strength
[21:18.020 --> 21:22.540]  and they were on the National Register, you know, I mean, for the
[21:23.220 --> 21:25.500]  they were distributed nationwide.
[21:26.060 --> 21:28.660]  So it was a much larger magazine.
[21:30.100 --> 21:33.580]  Yeah. But the growing agency, that was
[21:33.980 --> 21:38.940]  it was mainly on the West Coast because everything else.
[21:39.060 --> 21:41.100]  I mean, they just didn't have the growers
[21:41.420 --> 21:45.380]  to be open that would actually could buy a magazine.
[21:45.780 --> 21:48.420]  Right. Yeah.
[21:48.860 --> 21:51.220]  You pay cash and not on your card for it.
[21:52.340 --> 21:54.100]  Or, yeah. Oh, man.
[21:54.100 --> 21:56.220]  There was all kinds of stuff that happened.
[21:57.660 --> 22:01.980]  Yeah. But see, Alex or, you know, Tom, Alexandra, Alex, as I know him,
[22:02.900 --> 22:07.340]  he would make a run every every it was every two months.
[22:07.340 --> 22:09.820]  It would come out, I think every two months.
[22:09.820 --> 22:12.220]  Yeah. Or four times a year, maybe.
[22:12.220 --> 22:13.900]  I can't remember now.
[22:13.900 --> 22:17.460]  But yeah, four times a year and then later every two months.
[22:18.060 --> 22:20.460]  But and then later every month.
[22:20.580 --> 22:24.500]  Yeah. But they he would drive it
[22:25.220 --> 22:29.940]  from Corvallis, Oregon, where his his office was in a home
[22:30.540 --> 22:34.460]  down to northern California, down through Humboldt.
[22:35.500 --> 22:38.860]  Not all the way, maybe not to Santa Rosa, but
[22:39.500 --> 22:43.700]  oh, yeah. And just and distribute it personally, distribute it there.
[22:44.340 --> 22:45.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:45.660 --> 22:47.980]  I went on the trip a bunch.
[22:47.980 --> 22:49.300]  Yeah, that'd be fun.
[22:49.300 --> 22:52.700]  And he was you know, you're talking about the DEA and the raids.
[22:52.700 --> 22:55.860]  I believe he or his store was one of the ones caught up
[22:55.860 --> 22:57.860]  in the Operation Green Merchant.
[22:57.860 --> 23:00.380]  Yeah, well, in the 80s. OK.
[23:00.380 --> 23:06.340]  Which was, yeah, it was a big deal because Corvallis is a university town.
[23:06.860 --> 23:10.580]  It's a land grant school, so it's the agricultural school
[23:11.300 --> 23:13.020]  and or university.
[23:13.020 --> 23:17.220]  And he was the only one in the town
[23:17.220 --> 23:19.540]  that was caught up like this, you know, and it's a
[23:21.260 --> 23:23.460]  white, white bread town.
[23:24.660 --> 23:28.580]  And the DEA was there and they had a semi truck
[23:28.780 --> 23:33.180]  backed up to a store which was on the street downtown.
[23:33.820 --> 23:37.580]  Yeah. And so he got his kids, got a lot of flack.
[23:37.580 --> 23:39.580]  It was just it was really horrible.
[23:40.820 --> 23:43.580]  Yeah. Yes. He really suffered a lot.
[23:44.420 --> 23:49.860]  And then after that, though, he started Growing Edge magazine
[23:50.740 --> 23:53.980]  because all these advertisers,
[23:54.140 --> 23:55.340]  they they they quit it.
[23:55.340 --> 23:57.500]  They couldn't, you know, advertise.
[23:57.700 --> 23:59.820]  Yeah. And so it was all arrested.
[24:00.060 --> 24:04.860]  And that's yeah, that's one of the crazy things about this.
[24:05.300 --> 24:08.900]  There was a lot of shop owners that got caught up in it.
[24:08.900 --> 24:12.340]  And it's you know, it's it was a bad thing.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.620]  The worst part.
[24:13.620 --> 24:18.780]  120 people, 120 people were charged.
[24:19.580 --> 24:21.740]  Yeah. Oh, it was horrible.
[24:21.820 --> 24:23.060]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:23.060 --> 24:26.780]  Yeah. And from what I understand is, you know, they wind up taking,
[24:26.780 --> 24:29.580]  you know, all of the inventory, basically all the possessions
[24:29.580 --> 24:31.940]  and then never actually really filing charges.
[24:31.940 --> 24:33.980]  But after that, what can you do?
[24:33.980 --> 24:39.660]  Like you said, the advertisers fled and the the the subsequent magazine,
[24:39.660 --> 24:43.260]  though, is something a lot of people will probably recognize from growth stores,
[24:43.260 --> 24:47.180]  because I remember that one and it's, you know, tomatoes.
[24:47.620 --> 24:49.340]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
[24:49.340 --> 24:51.900]  That was that was the whole thing.
[24:51.900 --> 24:54.820]  Yeah. You had to use code words like that.
[24:54.980 --> 25:00.020]  And oh, but it was it was just nuts because there was entrapment
[25:00.020 --> 25:04.020]  then during those times, and there was it was just years of that,
[25:04.020 --> 25:06.980]  years and years of it. And then
[25:08.980 --> 25:10.300]  then what was it?
[25:10.300 --> 25:12.180]  2005 was it that
[25:13.900 --> 25:16.100]  the law in California changed?
[25:16.420 --> 25:19.700]  Yeah, it's the canvas came to California
[25:20.300 --> 25:22.420]  and everything changed.
[25:22.420 --> 25:24.700]  Well, that started things changing.
[25:25.260 --> 25:30.700]  And then Oregon and then and then later Washington for the medical.
[25:30.940 --> 25:34.060]  Yeah. And it made a big difference.
[25:34.420 --> 25:36.740]  But everybody was still afraid
[25:38.300 --> 25:43.740]  because. It seemed like they've been doing the same thing for so long that
[25:45.700 --> 25:47.180]  you can't change this.
[25:47.180 --> 25:50.100]  Nobody believes it. It's not true.
[25:50.100 --> 25:54.300]  So it really did take quite a while for people to start growing.
[25:55.340 --> 25:58.140]  It was spooky.
[25:58.140 --> 26:02.380]  A lot of it was almost, you know, self incriminating in that point.
[26:02.380 --> 26:03.900]  I was you know, I'm in Washington.
[26:03.900 --> 26:06.260]  I was in Washington when the medical laws passed.
[26:07.060 --> 26:09.500]  Medical card holder.
[26:09.700 --> 26:12.900]  But to do like collectives and stuff, you still had to register.
[26:12.900 --> 26:16.580]  You had to put things on paper and commit to what you were doing.
[26:16.580 --> 26:19.780]  And that that was that was a little bit scary.
[26:19.980 --> 26:25.300]  And it still is today, even in a fully legal marketplace here, because.
[26:25.300 --> 26:28.500]  Well, it's the United States
[26:29.300 --> 26:32.740]  and the United States has a very poor track record.
[26:32.980 --> 26:36.660]  Yes. Because for green merchant,
[26:36.660 --> 26:39.860]  they use the fucking Rico laws against us, right?
[26:40.220 --> 26:43.380]  Racketeering, the same ones they use for the mafia, the same ones
[26:43.380 --> 26:45.060]  they use for Hell's Angels.
[26:45.060 --> 26:48.260]  Those guys are they're way tougher, way tougher than that.
[26:49.140 --> 26:52.260]  It's like we're not tough guys, you know, gardeners, right?
[26:53.460 --> 26:58.700]  And so they use the same laws and they said they wouldn't when they implemented them.
[26:58.700 --> 27:02.540]  You know, they said they were specifically for for these organized crimes.
[27:03.100 --> 27:05.500]  And so so it's hard to believe.
[27:05.900 --> 27:08.820]  But I have to give this credit here in Spain.
[27:10.060 --> 27:13.700]  They separate those records because here
[27:14.420 --> 27:16.300]  cannabis isn't legal.
[27:16.300 --> 27:19.860]  It's tolerated in as much as you can grow a little at home.
[27:20.380 --> 27:23.020]  You're not supposed to to sell it. Right.
[27:23.860 --> 27:25.820]  But there's dispensaries.
[27:25.820 --> 27:28.780]  They don't. Well, they're called social clubs. But
[27:30.540 --> 27:34.140]  they they you know, there's kind of a gray area here.
[27:34.140 --> 27:37.340]  They don't say where they get the canvas from.
[27:38.780 --> 27:41.220]  But you can go there and buy it and smoke it.
[27:41.220 --> 27:45.660]  So the deal is you have to register there to, you know,
[27:45.660 --> 27:48.740]  give me your DNI or your you know, your ID.
[27:49.140 --> 27:54.540]  So they don't use that for anything else.
[27:54.540 --> 27:57.020]  It's only to prove this.
[27:57.020 --> 28:00.260]  It's only relegated just for that.
[28:00.780 --> 28:05.020]  And in America, it's like no way in hell you would ever fucking believe that in your life.
[28:05.020 --> 28:08.100]  No, it just doesn't happen.
[28:08.100 --> 28:09.900]  But here it actually does.
[28:09.900 --> 28:11.900]  It does. Yeah.
[28:12.460 --> 28:15.260]  Yeah. So that's reassuring, actually.
[28:15.900 --> 28:19.940]  It would be that'd be a nice feeling because, you know, again, there's
[28:19.940 --> 28:24.300]  there's conflicts of interest or something in the laws.
[28:24.300 --> 28:27.660]  One that comes up frequently, you know, again, in America is like, well,
[28:27.660 --> 28:32.140]  if you have a cannabis recommendation because, again, they're not prescriptions,
[28:32.140 --> 28:33.660]  they got to be recommendations.
[28:33.660 --> 28:37.300]  Well, then you can't own a firearm legally and have it licensed.
[28:37.540 --> 28:44.260]  It's just one of those weird gray areas that, as you said, the track record is not so good.
[28:44.260 --> 28:46.420]  No, no, not at all.
[28:46.420 --> 28:49.700]  I mean, the whole firearms thing there is now.
[28:49.700 --> 28:51.700]  What is it this year?
[28:52.900 --> 28:59.380]  Six hundred in one calendar year, there's like six hundred, six hundred mass shootings in America.
[28:59.380 --> 29:02.260]  That's like that is fucking crazy.
[29:02.260 --> 29:06.260]  You know, I read that the last one was the last one was the last one.
[29:06.340 --> 29:08.260]  The last one was a Walmart.
[29:08.900 --> 29:10.580]  Yes. American press.
[29:10.580 --> 29:13.460]  And you just don't see that stuff over here.
[29:14.420 --> 29:16.900]  There's no people just don't have a bunch of guns.
[29:17.460 --> 29:20.820]  You know, if you don't have the guns, you can't shoot them.
[29:20.820 --> 29:26.420]  You know, and it seems like there's so much aggression and stuff.
[29:27.860 --> 29:33.860]  We don't have so much aggression here, you know, it's a nicer, nicer place.
[29:34.660 --> 29:37.140]  That way, it's not I'm not afraid.
[29:37.140 --> 29:38.820]  Right. And it just works.
[29:38.820 --> 29:43.300]  We were talking a little bit before we came on air about a recent trip to Mexico.
[29:43.300 --> 29:44.020]  You have been there.
[29:44.020 --> 29:49.460]  But one of the things that, you know, we all commented on while we were there is just,
[29:49.460 --> 29:52.660]  you know, the driving, the way they drive the roads, you know, it's it's, you know,
[29:52.660 --> 29:58.020]  like basically two cars wide, but you got oncoming and you got little tuk tuks and you got all this.
[29:58.020 --> 30:02.020]  But they just know as long as you just keep doing what you're doing, stay in your place.
[30:02.020 --> 30:03.140]  They cruise right by.
[30:03.140 --> 30:04.340]  They'll pull over.
[30:04.340 --> 30:05.700]  Not a middle finger.
[30:05.700 --> 30:08.580]  Not, you know, not an angry look at the window.
[30:08.580 --> 30:09.460]  It just works.
[30:10.100 --> 30:10.900]  And we all come in there.
[30:10.900 --> 30:12.900]  I'm like in America, somebody had been shot.
[30:14.340 --> 30:20.580]  No, see everybody get by there and stuff because they have a hard time sometimes, you know,
[30:20.580 --> 30:27.300]  because they have what you call the room is those landslides and landslides sometimes,
[30:27.300 --> 30:30.100]  you know, but overall they got pretty good roads there.
[30:30.820 --> 30:37.780]  Oh, they have those with those maxi pistas, the freeways, you know, the big freeways.
[30:37.780 --> 30:38.740]  Those are really good.
[30:40.340 --> 30:43.780]  And but you were on the secondary roads out there, but it's.
[30:45.540 --> 30:47.300]  Yeah, they're good.
[30:47.300 --> 30:50.820]  You got to watch it because, you know, you could run off and stuff.
[30:52.020 --> 30:55.060]  There was there was jungle, jungle on either side.
[30:55.060 --> 30:59.060]  And there was one point when we were actually going to Maya Pond where it really was.
[30:59.060 --> 31:01.060]  It was just wide enough for one and a half cars.
[31:01.620 --> 31:06.260]  But it was it was like a hedge maze, how they had to just cut the jungle road.
[31:07.220 --> 31:12.260]  Yeah, they plant, they take cut trees and then make a fence out of the trees
[31:12.260 --> 31:18.420]  that they cut and it starts growing, you know, they put it in the ground and it grows.
[31:19.140 --> 31:24.820]  Yeah, I remember in Guatemala, the guys they'd be on the it is a long time ago.
[31:25.060 --> 31:30.580]  They were on that they were on the front of the train with machetes like.
[31:34.020 --> 31:37.300]  I mean, you know how tired you get with that machete after I mean,
[31:37.300 --> 31:42.420]  you know, 20 minutes is enough to go for a long time, you know.
[31:42.420 --> 31:46.500]  And oh, man, then they have to switch sides so they do the other arm, you know.
[31:49.460 --> 31:53.860]  But man, yeah, it's a selva, selva, you know,
[31:53.860 --> 31:56.660]  you don't really understand how it goes until you're there.
[31:56.660 --> 31:59.540]  It's like selva total. Yeah.
[32:01.220 --> 32:03.220]  It was it was a beautiful place.
[32:03.220 --> 32:07.940]  We had a wonderful time and, you know, we saw nothing but good, happy people.
[32:07.940 --> 32:11.860]  So, you know, different living conditions than I've ever seen in my life.
[32:11.860 --> 32:13.700]  But again, happy people.
[32:13.700 --> 32:17.060]  So it was we enjoyed ourselves back there.
[32:17.060 --> 32:17.560]  Yeah.
[32:18.420 --> 32:23.060]  They eat the tortillas, tortillas, tortillas out there, a little thicker.
[32:23.380 --> 32:23.880]  Yeah.
[32:26.100 --> 32:27.460]  Nice corn tortillas.
[32:27.460 --> 32:31.940]  And we went to so Merida on Sunday, we wound up going there and they have,
[32:31.940 --> 32:36.740]  you know, the big town square and Sunday is a big day in all of the towns there.
[32:36.740 --> 32:37.460]  Yep.
[32:37.460 --> 32:38.500]  Marketplace.
[32:38.500 --> 32:42.180]  They had, you know, like the clown performer entertaining the kids.
[32:42.180 --> 32:44.100]  They were doing all kinds of fun stuff.
[32:44.100 --> 32:44.740]  Music.
[32:44.740 --> 32:46.980]  I was like, man, that would be fun.
[32:46.980 --> 32:49.700]  Every Sunday, just town kind of gets down like that.
[32:50.660 --> 32:56.340]  No, it's really interesting, you know, that part because what you see it,
[32:56.340 --> 33:01.300]  well, maybe more a little bit further south there, but you got the cathedrals.
[33:01.300 --> 33:03.140]  There's all the Catholics.
[33:03.140 --> 33:04.420]  They took over that area.
[33:05.060 --> 33:10.580]  And then there's all these pagan ceremonies that happen within the Catholic Church.
[33:11.140 --> 33:12.820]  It's it's really pretty cool.
[33:13.380 --> 33:13.880]  Yeah.
[33:15.540 --> 33:18.740]  So a lot of good times out there.
[33:18.820 --> 33:19.700]  A lot of good times.
[33:20.900 --> 33:21.700]  Yeah.
[33:21.700 --> 33:28.900]  So, but the cannabis, I mean, I remember, God, we used to, we had some killer cannabis back.
[33:28.900 --> 33:31.540]  I went to university there in Mexico.
[33:32.020 --> 33:32.520]  Okay.
[33:33.620 --> 33:35.780]  University Americas in Puebla.
[33:35.780 --> 33:36.980]  Actually, it's in Cholula.
[33:38.420 --> 33:44.020]  Hello, the Puebla, but Cholula is a suburb of Puebla.
[33:44.420 --> 33:50.180]  The town of Puebla or city of Puebla and southeast of Mexico city about two hours.
[33:53.780 --> 33:54.420]  Yeah.
[33:54.420 --> 34:01.940]  And we, I mean, I was there three days and bought a kilo of this killer.
[34:03.540 --> 34:04.660]  It was great.
[34:05.300 --> 34:06.900]  It was, oh man.
[34:07.460 --> 34:12.980]  And it was like 25 bucks, you know, 25 bucks was a bit of money back then, but
[34:13.460 --> 34:16.420]  you know, it'd be like about maybe, you know, 50 bucks now.
[34:17.860 --> 34:19.700]  It wasn't such a bad deal.
[34:20.260 --> 34:22.820]  And, you know, I had come rolled in paper and stuff.
[34:22.820 --> 34:25.860]  It was a newspaper about three thick and just.
[34:25.860 --> 34:26.360]  Geez.
[34:27.620 --> 34:28.120]  Yeah.
[34:28.500 --> 34:30.100]  And not pressed.
[34:30.100 --> 34:32.500]  She didn't want to get it pressed because they'd press it.
[34:32.500 --> 34:35.540]  And that, you know, those Adobe brick presses.
[34:35.540 --> 34:36.340]  No. Oh yeah.
[34:37.300 --> 34:38.820]  Infamous brick weed.
[34:38.820 --> 34:39.140]  Yeah.
[34:39.140 --> 34:41.140]  They just stuff everything in there.
[34:41.780 --> 34:43.380]  Lizards rocks, everything.
[34:45.620 --> 34:51.220]  But anyway, we would get back to, we would get the, you know, the volcanoes there's.
[34:51.860 --> 34:58.100]  There's East popo and what's your, yeah.
[34:59.300 --> 35:02.740]  But we would get the, the, the, they call it popo blue.
[35:04.260 --> 35:08.100]  And that was it would turn colors.
[35:08.180 --> 35:16.180]  It would turn purple because it was blue because it was grown at a high altitude and it got cold.
[35:16.820 --> 35:21.380]  So, but anyway, that was a really good thing to me that we got locally there.
[35:22.180 --> 35:25.460]  And we got several other really good ones.
[35:27.060 --> 35:30.500]  There was a Mishawa Khan that came and Wahaka.
[35:31.060 --> 35:32.900]  We would get regularly at school.
[35:34.340 --> 35:34.980]  Yeah.
[35:34.980 --> 35:35.460]  Yeah.
[35:35.460 --> 35:37.940]  There was really good, really good cannabis there.
[35:38.900 --> 35:41.140]  It was pretty nice.
[35:41.140 --> 35:45.060]  And then back then that was in the seventies back then.
[35:45.060 --> 35:52.420]  Nobody was shipping, seeing some media to America.
[35:52.980 --> 35:54.820]  Nobody even knew what it was.
[35:54.820 --> 35:55.140]  Right.
[35:56.020 --> 35:56.420]  Yeah.
[35:56.420 --> 36:01.380]  We had it in Mexico in the well, mid seventies.
[36:01.380 --> 36:02.100]  Yeah.
[36:02.100 --> 36:02.580]  Wow.
[36:02.580 --> 36:03.380]  Okay.
[36:03.380 --> 36:05.620]  Cause we always, we always think of it backwards.
[36:05.620 --> 36:12.100]  And, you know, when we were there, we, we got a really big 20 sack, but it did have seeds in it.
[36:12.100 --> 36:13.860]  So that was kind of exciting in itself.
[36:14.580 --> 36:15.060]  Yeah.
[36:15.060 --> 36:22.420]  Most of it had seeds in it, but the, the popo a lot of times didn't, but you couldn't count.
[36:22.420 --> 36:23.700]  Yeah.
[36:23.700 --> 36:24.100]  Yeah.
[36:24.100 --> 36:27.940]  But 20% didn't have seeds, seeds in me.
[36:29.220 --> 36:29.620]  Yeah.
[36:29.620 --> 36:30.740]  Just a small portion.
[36:32.340 --> 36:32.580]  Yeah.
[36:32.580 --> 36:33.060]  Yeah.
[36:33.060 --> 36:34.580]  Well, those were good days.
[36:34.580 --> 36:37.380]  It was always a good sativa buzz.
[36:38.100 --> 36:41.460]  And then we could get the Acapulco cannabis too.
[36:42.580 --> 36:45.780]  We didn't get tons of that at where I was at.
[36:46.820 --> 36:50.740]  And then I went, you know, I mean, that was in the seventies and I've been back at, you know,
[36:52.100 --> 36:53.060]  numerous times.
[36:53.700 --> 36:58.180]  And then, God, this one, Oh man.
[36:59.140 --> 37:00.900]  Some crazy people I met.
[37:00.900 --> 37:01.460]  Oh, I know.
[37:01.780 --> 37:03.220]  Oh geez.
[37:03.220 --> 37:08.260]  Oh, this one guy, I know Ed, Ed, he just got out of jail.
[37:08.260 --> 37:10.260]  He just got out of jail.
[37:10.260 --> 37:13.540]  And soon as, I mean, he's, he's off probation.
[37:13.540 --> 37:17.700]  Soon as he can get across the border, he's out working again.
[37:17.700 --> 37:18.020]  Right.
[37:19.220 --> 37:20.500]  He's really a nice guy.
[37:20.500 --> 37:24.580]  One of those guys that you just, he's fun to hang around and you always kind of like
[37:24.580 --> 37:26.420]  draws attention and stuff.
[37:26.500 --> 37:30.420]  Well, he could, his, his job was to like score dope.
[37:30.420 --> 37:36.340]  And he was like, and so, so he left, I remember he came over to visit and then he left and he
[37:36.340 --> 37:42.660]  came back about a month later and the fucker comes back and he's got like the whole car
[37:42.660 --> 37:45.540]  full of dope and they're all in his 20 liter.
[37:45.540 --> 37:47.300]  Well, they're five gallon containers.
[37:47.300 --> 37:47.540]  Right.
[37:48.180 --> 37:52.180]  And he's got like about, I don't know, the whole car was full of them.
[37:52.180 --> 37:52.660]  Yeah.
[37:52.740 --> 37:58.180]  And then, oh man, but he'd been all over the place up and down the coast.
[37:58.180 --> 37:58.420]  Yeah.
[37:58.420 --> 38:02.500]  And he just was one of those guys that just, well, usually he was pretty lucky.
[38:03.700 --> 38:07.140]  But his whole house, you can smell it about a block away.
[38:12.660 --> 38:18.420]  Now back then, you know, I mean, little towns, it's, I don't know.
[38:18.500 --> 38:23.940]  You, if you didn't want to have troubles, you didn't have troubles, you know, I mean,
[38:23.940 --> 38:26.020]  you could work things out so you have no trouble.
[38:26.660 --> 38:26.820]  Yeah.
[38:26.820 --> 38:28.260]  And now it's a bit different.
[38:28.260 --> 38:32.420]  It seems like everybody kind of is got their nose in your business.
[38:33.060 --> 38:33.300]  Yeah.
[38:34.260 --> 38:35.220]  It's more expensive.
[38:37.220 --> 38:39.140]  But yeah, yeah.
[38:39.140 --> 38:39.780]  Mexico.
[38:42.580 --> 38:42.980]  Anyway.
[38:43.700 --> 38:45.940]  Oh gosh.
[38:45.940 --> 38:46.180]  Yeah.
[38:46.180 --> 38:49.300]  It's just kind of drifting off there thinking about Mexico.
[38:49.300 --> 38:50.980]  Haven't been there for a while.
[38:50.980 --> 38:59.540]  Actually, I was there, you know, well, Vicente Fox, Vicente Fox, he was the president from
[38:59.540 --> 39:02.580]  2000 to 2006 of Mexico.
[39:02.580 --> 39:09.540]  He was a member of the party, not the, not the PRI, and which was a big upset.
[39:10.260 --> 39:17.700]  But anyway, he's down in Guanajuato or Guanajuato state.
[39:18.500 --> 39:21.060]  And yeah, I know him.
[39:21.060 --> 39:24.660]  He wrote the forward to that one book, the cannabis.
[39:26.740 --> 39:29.540]  Yeah, he's an interesting guy.
[39:29.540 --> 39:30.500]  Interesting guy.
[39:30.500 --> 39:30.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:31.620 --> 39:35.220]  That would be, you know, an interesting person just to even converse with.
[39:35.220 --> 39:42.260]  I mean, the president of a nation is multifaceted, probably rather intelligent and can probably
[39:42.260 --> 39:49.140]  offer some, you know, insight even without having technical prowess in gardening.
[39:49.140 --> 39:50.420]  That's an assumption, but.
[39:50.420 --> 39:54.500]  Yeah, actually, he's got a big farm there or ranch there.
[39:54.500 --> 39:55.380]  What they call it?
[39:55.380 --> 39:57.620]  Everybody has a rancho grande.
[39:58.020 --> 39:59.780]  Rancho grande.
[40:01.620 --> 40:07.940]  But anyway, yeah, he's married to, to, oh, what was it?
[40:07.940 --> 40:12.500]  Like a land aristocracy heir of a woman.
[40:12.500 --> 40:19.140]  They're mega rich in Guanajuato state.
[40:20.180 --> 40:26.100]  And yeah, he used to be the president of Coca-Cola.
[40:28.260 --> 40:33.860]  In Mexico, but he's got, you know, political connections.
[40:33.860 --> 40:36.020]  It's, it's, it's pretty amazing.
[40:36.660 --> 40:41.700]  All of the, all of the connections, but, you know, I have to say Mexico, and if there's
[40:41.700 --> 40:49.060]  Mexican guys listening to this, I'm sure they'll chime in, but, or Latinos, man, Mexico is just
[40:49.060 --> 40:53.140]  rough, you know, it's really rough to make things go.
[40:53.380 --> 40:58.260]  And it's hard.
[40:58.260 --> 41:01.700]  It's been, it's been legal, the cannabis, they want it legal.
[41:01.700 --> 41:03.220]  It was a human rights issue.
[41:04.100 --> 41:10.580]  And, you know, like my buddy, like, for example, Julio Sunil, Julio that has Canemo, Canemo,
[41:10.580 --> 41:16.980]  the magazine, Canemo, hemp magazine in, in Mexico City.
[41:16.980 --> 41:18.260]  I think he's in Mexico City.
[41:18.260 --> 41:18.900]  Yeah.
[41:18.900 --> 41:20.580]  Anyway, he, yeah, it is.
[41:21.300 --> 41:29.460]  He's, he's barely eking out a living, you know, it's hard to make everything work there.
[41:30.580 --> 41:32.740]  They haven't set up any markets.
[41:32.740 --> 41:34.260]  It's not totally legal.
[41:35.220 --> 41:36.660]  They don't have the rules set.
[41:37.860 --> 41:46.660]  A lot of people have invested, but politicians are still jockeying around to get control
[41:46.660 --> 41:47.620]  of stuff.
[41:47.620 --> 41:48.500]  So I don't know.
[41:48.900 --> 41:50.020]  It's really hard.
[41:50.020 --> 41:57.300]  And then each, each state is different, you know, the folks, he, he like, he's like the
[41:57.300 --> 41:58.820]  guy they see in Guanajuato.
[41:59.780 --> 42:06.340]  But you go, you go say, well, Durango, now that's, see, and then there's a bunch of mafia
[42:06.340 --> 42:07.460]  influence there too.
[42:08.180 --> 42:13.300]  You got like, you know, and they just, they're just, it's just a fact of life.
[42:13.300 --> 42:14.260]  That's the way it is.
[42:14.980 --> 42:16.980]  So there's, there's a lot of factors there.
[42:16.980 --> 42:17.620]  So I don't know.
[42:17.620 --> 42:23.780]  I mean, I, I hope they get things going, but for small growers, it's pretty hard for a
[42:23.780 --> 42:24.500]  lot of guys.
[42:25.060 --> 42:27.860]  There's good associations, man.
[42:27.860 --> 42:34.260]  There's some really good friends there, you know, small guys, but as far as being a country
[42:34.260 --> 42:36.020]  that produces a lot, I don't know.
[42:37.060 --> 42:41.540]  And same other places with the Sudamerica, Latin America too.
[42:42.340 --> 42:48.580]  They just, the politics are so difficult internally that it's hard for them to get organized.
[42:49.460 --> 42:49.860]  It is.
[42:49.860 --> 42:54.260]  And I see, you know, again, just kind of based off of the climate, the amount of sun that
[42:54.260 --> 43:00.180]  they get that, you know, that, that two, 300 acre project might be what it is, but it's
[43:00.180 --> 43:05.940]  not going to be like consumer grade flower that you put on the shelf.
[43:05.940 --> 43:09.540]  It's more than likely going to be extracted for its cannabinoid content.
[43:09.540 --> 43:11.140]  That, that's kind of what I picture there.
[43:11.860 --> 43:12.420]  Yeah.
[43:12.420 --> 43:13.300]  A lot of it is.
[43:13.300 --> 43:17.380]  Well, see, one of the biggest problems is the politics and the international borders,
[43:18.020 --> 43:21.460]  because, you know, they have to have a domestic market.
[43:22.100 --> 43:28.980]  I think, like Mexico, they got a hundred and about 120,000, 120 million Mexicans, I think.
[43:30.740 --> 43:34.580]  So, you know, they, they, they have a local market.
[43:34.580 --> 43:36.340]  Everybody wants to export it, right?
[43:36.900 --> 43:38.340]  Well, who's going to export it?
[43:38.340 --> 43:42.900]  Because most of those countries that can, you know, would buy it, they can also grow it.
[43:43.460 --> 43:46.180]  And Germany, everybody look at Germany over here.
[43:48.020 --> 43:53.300]  And Germany, they've got all of the means to, to, to grow all the cannabis they need.
[43:53.860 --> 43:56.900]  And they're a huge agricultural country too.
[43:57.540 --> 44:01.780]  I don't know so many people if you realize that, but it's a very, very big.
[44:02.420 --> 44:04.100]  Agriculture is real big in Germany.
[44:04.820 --> 44:08.180]  So I just don't know where all those guys are going to go.
[44:09.700 --> 44:12.340]  They can overproduce and we'll see.
[44:12.340 --> 44:12.820]  Right.
[44:12.820 --> 44:16.500]  Thailand, you know, Thailand's kind of a new, a new game right now.
[44:16.500 --> 44:18.820]  They, they kind of opened it up like Colorado did.
[44:18.820 --> 44:21.620]  They just said, okay, everything's, everything's good.
[44:22.340 --> 44:31.780]  Well, in Thailand, there's, there's quite a movement to, to scale back or stop the recreational
[44:31.780 --> 44:38.900]  part, but scale back there's a movement right now in the, in the, the government within
[44:39.700 --> 44:44.500]  one of the houses or both the houses of government, the conservative guys,
[44:45.060 --> 44:46.580]  which is kind of a backlash.
[44:46.580 --> 44:48.980]  You kind of expect that kind of stuff.
[44:50.660 --> 44:53.220]  So we'll see what happens there.
[44:53.220 --> 44:55.220]  Cause it's just gone hog wild.
[44:55.220 --> 45:00.180]  And, and, you know, I don't know if those guys realize it, but once you let the cat out of the
[45:00.180 --> 45:09.140]  bag, there are so many seeds in such an attitude change that it's really expensive to get people to
[45:09.140 --> 45:09.640]  quit.
[45:10.180 --> 45:15.300]  You know, you gotta, you gotta have a lot of police action and that's expensive.
[45:16.020 --> 45:17.220]  And then, oh yeah.
[45:17.220 --> 45:19.620]  Public, public relations campaign.
[45:19.620 --> 45:22.020]  And then you have to lie to everybody.
[45:22.020 --> 45:22.660]  It's horrible.
[45:23.780 --> 45:28.020]  And, and, and, you know, we, we've seen that happen here when they try to scale back or,
[45:28.020 --> 45:34.260]  you know, the, the, or stop it, the, the war on drugs, which I think we all agree is abject
[45:34.260 --> 45:34.760]  failure.
[45:36.180 --> 45:37.780]  It's a bad approach to it.
[45:39.540 --> 45:44.260]  And yeah, so that's, you know, again, Netherlands it's, and it sounds like Spain too.
[45:44.260 --> 45:49.380]  It's like, we're going to focus on drugs that are lethal ones that cause more crime.
[45:49.940 --> 45:54.500]  We'll give you a little bit of freedom to do what you want, but on the mass scale where we're not
[45:54.500 --> 45:58.260]  there yet and, and Netherlands is going backwards, actually.
[45:58.260 --> 46:04.260]  Well, yeah, they are, but see, there was all that drug tourism and they got really conservative.
[46:04.260 --> 46:10.020]  That guy, oh, what's his, Velders, Velders.
[46:10.020 --> 46:14.900]  He, he was a big leader of the conservative party.
[46:14.900 --> 46:21.700]  And then now they've got the conservative government for some time, also in Amsterdam too.
[46:21.780 --> 46:27.140]  And so they've just gone backwards and see in Spain, all like most of those guys moved down
[46:27.140 --> 46:29.620]  here because the weather's way better.
[46:29.620 --> 46:33.540]  And, but now there's a bit, a lot of growing and stuff going on here.
[46:33.540 --> 46:42.420]  In fact, I just saw this, it was just as the Guardia Civil, Saint Patron de Helena's, this was,
[46:44.020 --> 46:46.980]  this was all popped on, this happened.
[46:51.860 --> 47:01.940]  They found 50 tons of cannabis around Valencia.
[47:04.660 --> 47:07.060]  That's like a hundred thousand pounds people.
[47:08.100 --> 47:09.300]  Quite the report.
[47:09.300 --> 47:09.700]  Yeah.
[47:09.700 --> 47:10.660]  Quite the report.
[47:11.780 --> 47:17.220]  Oh, hopefully they, hopefully they do the classic move where they just put it in a field and then
[47:17.220 --> 47:20.500]  burn it and wonder why everybody around is so giggly afterwards.
[47:21.460 --> 47:21.860]  Right.
[47:22.980 --> 47:23.700]  Right.
[47:23.700 --> 47:24.020]  Yeah.
[47:24.020 --> 47:29.700]  But it's, they've been having really big arrests here.
[47:29.700 --> 47:33.860]  And then there was one right after that, another one for 32.
[47:35.860 --> 47:36.100]  Yeah.
[47:36.900 --> 47:37.460]  32.
[47:39.780 --> 47:40.980]  This is the other one.
[47:40.980 --> 47:41.780]  Yeah.
[47:41.780 --> 47:50.180]  And this is a, well, yeah, but the 32, the thing is with the 32 tons,
[47:50.660 --> 47:56.420]  that was all CBD and they were making fun of the cops.
[47:56.420 --> 47:59.860]  They said, you confiscated all of this, you're in big trouble.
[48:01.220 --> 48:02.420]  Ooh, wow.
[48:03.620 --> 48:04.180]  Yeah.
[48:04.180 --> 48:05.700]  Little overzealous there.
[48:06.340 --> 48:07.060]  Yeah.
[48:07.060 --> 48:07.460]  Gosh.
[48:08.340 --> 48:14.180]  That's like the cop here in front of the table with, you know, like the ounce laid out,
[48:14.180 --> 48:16.820]  the $20 bills in front of it, just smiling.
[48:17.540 --> 48:17.860]  Oops.
[48:17.860 --> 48:18.100]  Yeah.
[48:18.100 --> 48:19.460]  They do that here all the time.
[48:20.100 --> 48:22.100]  But yeah, yeah.
[48:22.100 --> 48:27.380]  But the place to be really, I mean, United States is really a good place to be for cultivation now.
[48:28.340 --> 48:29.780]  Everything's going on there.
[48:30.980 --> 48:32.500]  It's what is it?
[48:33.060 --> 48:38.740]  More than 90, 95% of all the legal cannabis in the world is sold in the United States now.
[48:40.900 --> 48:41.060]  Yeah.
[48:41.060 --> 48:41.380]  Yeah.
[48:44.420 --> 48:44.660]  Yeah.
[48:44.660 --> 48:48.900]  I wish we could improve, you know, on the quality that'll, I think, come with time.
[48:49.860 --> 48:55.220]  My thought is if it does go federally legal, then that's going to be an open market where
[48:55.220 --> 48:57.140]  Kraft is going to be able to get in there.
[48:57.140 --> 49:02.260]  You're never going to compete on volume or price, but if you have something that's good,
[49:02.260 --> 49:05.780]  consumers are willing to pay for top shelf things at times.
[49:05.780 --> 49:07.540]  So yeah, they will.
[49:07.540 --> 49:13.860]  And I think if we continue to promote small home growers, I'd like to see a lot of, you know,
[49:13.860 --> 49:18.740]  like backyard tomatoes are better than the ones you buy down at the fruit stand.
[49:19.620 --> 49:24.020]  You know, you can let them ripen on the vine and pick it at the right time.
[49:24.020 --> 49:28.740]  Or the corn, it's got all the sugar in the kernel rather than starch because you pick it really
[49:28.740 --> 49:29.220]  quickly.
[49:29.940 --> 49:35.140]  You know, you pick it and cook it at that time and that keeps it from converting to starch.
[49:35.140 --> 49:37.780]  So there's all these really important things.
[49:37.780 --> 49:45.060]  And now the deal is with the cannabis, it's nobody wants their, to smoke last year's dope.
[49:45.620 --> 49:47.780]  They all want to smoke this year's dope.
[49:47.780 --> 49:50.260]  Nobody wants it over six months old.
[49:51.060 --> 49:52.740]  It's really incredible.
[49:54.740 --> 49:59.780]  Yeah, none of those things come over or are common over here.
[50:01.060 --> 50:05.940]  There's this, yeah, there's supply chain issues and that's really just tied into the regulations.
[50:05.940 --> 50:10.980]  And, you know, again, hopefully the further the experiment goes, the better it will be
[50:10.980 --> 50:11.860]  worked out.
[50:11.860 --> 50:16.260]  All depends on what interests are really leading the ship there.
[50:16.260 --> 50:23.460]  But, you know, that's what we can do as home growers and just kind of as advocates, you
[50:23.460 --> 50:24.580]  know, educate people.
[50:25.380 --> 50:25.940]  Right, right.
[50:25.940 --> 50:26.980]  And well, what about you?
[50:26.980 --> 50:29.060]  Can you grow outdoors there at all?
[50:29.060 --> 50:33.300]  I mean, during the summer, you should be able to under plastic pretty well, right?
[50:34.420 --> 50:38.660]  Well, where I'm at, I'm right on the ocean, west side of the mountains.
[50:38.660 --> 50:40.980]  So it's a little too wet.
[50:41.860 --> 50:48.420]  I would hate to have that like September heartbreak of nothing but rain and three more weeks to
[50:48.420 --> 50:49.860]  go on your crop.
[50:50.420 --> 50:51.540]  Autos might work.
[50:53.140 --> 50:57.060]  East side of the mountains though, definitely you get a lot more of that here, but it's
[50:57.060 --> 51:00.980]  as you might may have seen, it's predominantly indoors here on the west side.
[51:01.620 --> 51:02.740]  Sure, sure, sure.
[51:03.460 --> 51:13.380]  Well, because, yeah, I've got a friend that lives in north Spain and he's it's the North
[51:13.380 --> 51:13.860]  Sea there.
[51:14.500 --> 51:16.580]  Well, it's for us, it's north.
[51:16.580 --> 51:24.900]  But yeah, he just has a greenhouse and it rains and he overcomes it with the plastic,
[51:24.900 --> 51:25.400]  right?
[51:26.820 --> 51:30.820]  But it's funny you mentioned those auto flowers.
[51:31.380 --> 51:38.180]  I saw some really killer auto flowers and there's at first I pooped out of flowers.
[51:38.180 --> 51:43.700]  I thought, oh, God, what a, you know, it's like kind of like a nice little toy plant,
[51:44.260 --> 51:49.060]  but actually they're really way cooler than I ever gave them credit for it all.
[51:50.260 --> 51:55.780]  And it's just and I know this from hanging out with scientists that have already proved
[51:55.780 --> 51:55.940]  it.
[51:55.940 --> 51:57.700]  It's just a few genes, right?
[51:57.700 --> 51:59.780]  The control, the auto flower function.
[52:00.420 --> 52:04.500]  So all you have to do, you can take those genes and put them in any plant.
[52:04.500 --> 52:07.460]  You know, it may take a little while, but you can do that, right?
[52:08.100 --> 52:16.900]  So it's just an on off switch that you're basically taking out the switch, the photoperiodic
[52:16.900 --> 52:19.940]  switch, and you're putting in a chronological switch.
[52:19.940 --> 52:22.580]  That's the difference in the genes, right?
[52:23.460 --> 52:32.020]  So if you have a plant that's say it's a indica type and it flowers and it completes
[52:32.020 --> 52:37.780]  flowering in like seven and a half weeks, okay, you put the auto flower gene in with
[52:37.780 --> 52:37.940]  that.
[52:37.940 --> 52:45.460]  Well, your auto, it won't take as long to finish flowering because the auto flower also
[52:45.460 --> 52:46.500]  flowers differently.
[52:46.500 --> 52:51.220]  It starts flowering and it builds up and it also grows at the same time, which is a different
[52:51.220 --> 52:51.860]  growth habit.
[52:52.580 --> 52:59.220]  But if you take a long season sativa that takes say like 12 weeks to mature, you know,
[52:59.220 --> 53:04.180]  and you put the auto flower gene in there, it takes the auto flower plant take much longer,
[53:04.740 --> 53:06.820]  take longer to mature, right?
[53:06.820 --> 53:10.980]  And so it grows bigger too, because it grows longer.
[53:10.980 --> 53:19.700]  And so you can get these combinations where you get a plant that grows really fast, you
[53:19.700 --> 53:21.700]  know, with like a sativa type.
[53:21.700 --> 53:28.580]  And then also you combine that with the auto flowers that grow fast and you can get these
[53:28.580 --> 53:30.020]  really big plants.
[53:30.020 --> 53:36.500]  I saw really big plants that were only a few months old and that were already flowering,
[53:36.500 --> 53:38.340]  but they were auto flowering.
[53:38.340 --> 53:46.260]  And one guy, one guy, well, he's in the book, Dr. Clinton, Clinton Shock.
[53:46.260 --> 53:47.940]  He lived, in fact, I can't believe it.
[53:47.940 --> 53:49.620]  He lives in my hometown, right?
[53:49.620 --> 53:50.020]  Oh, wow.
[53:50.820 --> 53:51.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:51.300 --> 53:53.140]  He's Professor Emeritus.
[53:53.140 --> 53:54.180]  This is all in the book.
[53:54.900 --> 53:59.780]  Professor Emeritus at in Corvallis at the Oregon State University.
[53:59.780 --> 54:00.260]  Oh, yeah.
[54:00.260 --> 54:02.500]  The hemp program there.
[54:02.500 --> 54:12.500]  So they're breeding industrial hemp or fiber hemp and also high CBD hemp, but mainly the
[54:12.500 --> 54:13.860]  high CBD hemp, right?
[54:14.740 --> 54:23.460]  And this guy, I mean, he's older than me and he's got a whole lifetime of breeding and
[54:23.460 --> 54:24.900]  a doctorate's degree.
[54:24.900 --> 54:33.140]  And gosh, we went and looked at a lot of his, well, at his breeding area outside of town
[54:33.140 --> 54:34.980]  there and it's several acres.
[54:34.980 --> 54:41.380]  And he was breeding like, oh, 20 different species, 30 different species of plants.
[54:41.940 --> 54:44.500]  And the cannabis was just another one.
[54:44.500 --> 54:49.540]  But he had a whole house, a whole three bedroom house that's out there on that farm that's
[54:49.540 --> 54:50.980]  just full of seeds.
[54:50.980 --> 54:51.460]  That's it.
[54:52.180 --> 54:52.500]  Wow.
[54:53.380 --> 54:54.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:54.260 --> 54:57.140]  Seeds all crazy, crazy seeds, you know?
[54:57.860 --> 55:02.100]  And but anyway, and listen to this, this is important too.
[55:02.100 --> 55:06.900]  He spends like 90% of his budget for cannabis.
[55:06.900 --> 55:08.900]  That's all spent on testing.
[55:09.460 --> 55:10.020]  He tests.
[55:10.820 --> 55:11.780]  That's what he says.
[55:11.780 --> 55:13.940]  His whole budget goes there, testing.
[55:13.940 --> 55:18.260]  Yeah, the other thing, you know, he needs a few other little supplies, but that testing,
[55:18.260 --> 55:19.460]  that's like number one.
[55:20.900 --> 55:21.540]  Yeah.
[55:21.540 --> 55:26.900]  And he's, he develops stuff real fast because he's not only got, you know, I mean, he's
[55:26.900 --> 55:33.860]  pragmatic, but he uses the basic rules and progresses incredibly quickly.
[55:33.860 --> 55:35.940]  And he also has a big selection.
[55:35.940 --> 55:38.100]  He had several acres of selection too.
[55:39.220 --> 55:39.460]  Yeah.
[55:40.020 --> 55:45.380]  When you get room to play, I mean, OSU is phenomenal as far as a resource.
[55:45.380 --> 55:50.260]  I did some classes, sustainable agriculture with WSU.
[55:50.260 --> 55:52.580]  So up in Washington, that's our agricultural school.
[55:53.140 --> 55:55.700]  Really good, really good classes though.
[55:55.700 --> 55:56.100]  Yeah.
[55:56.100 --> 55:56.580]  Yeah.
[55:56.580 --> 55:56.980]  Yeah.
[55:56.980 --> 55:59.940]  And, you know, again, we got to get out there in the field.
[55:59.940 --> 56:03.380]  And this was in the stage when they were doing the Cosmic Crisp Apple.
[56:03.380 --> 56:07.540]  It was like the final testing stages of that before it went released to market.
[56:07.540 --> 56:08.900]  So that was, that was kind of fun.
[56:08.900 --> 56:10.900]  We, we got to have them pre-market.
[56:11.860 --> 56:12.340]  Right.
[56:12.340 --> 56:14.180]  See all of that apple stuff.
[56:14.180 --> 56:15.860]  That's really interesting stuff.
[56:15.860 --> 56:21.460]  Cause see, you know, when the Soviet union broke up, all of these, I knew these guys
[56:21.460 --> 56:23.140]  just like real fruit junkies.
[56:23.140 --> 56:27.540]  They went over there after it broke up and started, cause he had all of these apples
[56:27.540 --> 56:28.020]  and stuff.
[56:28.580 --> 56:30.020]  So see, yeah, yeah.
[56:30.020 --> 56:34.500]  He had all these apples that we didn't know about and nobody had bread bread with.
[56:34.500 --> 56:38.420]  So then they, and then they made a bunch of new varieties.
[56:38.420 --> 56:39.220]  Yeah.
[56:39.220 --> 56:41.620]  It's, it's pretty incredible.
[56:41.620 --> 56:45.540]  Cause see the apple, that was where you'd store store sugar.
[56:45.540 --> 56:48.500]  If you're in Northern latitude, that's where you could store sugar.
[56:48.500 --> 56:53.860]  And that was, and so, you know, if you're in a Northern latitude, I mean, that's what
[56:53.860 --> 56:54.420]  you do.
[56:54.420 --> 56:56.420]  You know, yeah.
[56:56.420 --> 56:56.740]  Yeah.
[56:56.740 --> 57:01.940]  So it was closed for all those years and they had some killer stuff, but yeah, I know guys
[57:01.940 --> 57:02.820]  from Oregon.
[57:02.820 --> 57:04.660]  That's when I lived in Oregon back then.
[57:04.660 --> 57:04.900]  Yeah.
[57:06.020 --> 57:06.580]  Yeah.
[57:06.580 --> 57:08.580]  Just, you know, little tidbits.
[57:08.580 --> 57:08.820]  Yeah.
[57:09.620 --> 57:13.780]  So I think, well, last time we were, we had talked to you, you were eating, I believe
[57:13.780 --> 57:16.980]  it was cherries and you were enjoying the local cherries.
[57:16.980 --> 57:21.300]  So when you came over here, did you try any of our being or our Rainier cherries?
[57:21.300 --> 57:21.860]  Yeah.
[57:21.860 --> 57:28.020]  The ones, what are the big ones over there in Oregon were Lambert's and then Rainier's
[57:28.020 --> 57:28.820]  are big too.
[57:28.820 --> 57:29.540]  I remember.
[57:30.500 --> 57:32.980]  And the old ones, what are those Queen Anne?
[57:36.020 --> 57:39.220]  They're a dual color, double color, not so dark.
[57:39.860 --> 57:40.500]  Right.
[57:40.500 --> 57:41.620]  Kind of the yellow, the red.
[57:41.620 --> 57:43.140]  I almost want to say that's the Bing.
[57:44.020 --> 57:44.740]  Yeah.
[57:44.740 --> 57:45.460]  No, no.
[57:45.460 --> 57:51.060]  Bing's usually dark, but the Bing's not, I mean, that was the big one, the big, big
[57:51.060 --> 57:54.500]  one for a long time, but that they've superior.
[57:54.500 --> 57:57.940]  I mean, they've gone, there's better varieties than Bing now.
[57:57.940 --> 58:00.180]  Oh, I need to get out more than is what you're saying.
[58:00.180 --> 58:00.680]  Yeah.
[58:01.300 --> 58:01.800]  Yeah.
[58:01.860 --> 58:02.820]  There's better varieties.
[58:02.820 --> 58:03.620]  They hold better.
[58:03.620 --> 58:09.860]  They stay, they're, they're more, they've got more stringentness to them where they
[58:09.860 --> 58:10.980]  hold their form better.
[58:10.980 --> 58:13.220]  They don't decompose so fast.
[58:14.100 --> 58:14.340]  Yeah.
[58:14.340 --> 58:14.820]  Yeah.
[58:14.820 --> 58:16.660]  And we get fruit here.
[58:16.660 --> 58:25.460]  Most of it comes, that the cherries, that comes from over east of us over in like Teruel,
[58:26.020 --> 58:35.620]  Lerida, yeah, over, over by, well, about two hours east of us is the fruit growing
[58:35.620 --> 58:37.300]  area for us here.
[58:37.860 --> 58:38.420]  Okay.
[58:38.420 --> 58:38.920]  Yeah.
[58:39.860 --> 58:46.100]  All of the, all of the stuff, but yeah, that is getting back to those auto flowers.
[58:46.100 --> 58:51.940]  We're going to see some really incredible stuff there, I think, because these plants,
[58:51.940 --> 58:56.900]  well, the ones that plant had, they were about four feet tall.
[58:56.900 --> 59:03.300]  Well, you can see them there in the first chapter breeding or botany, botany.
[59:04.900 --> 59:12.740]  And my God, they were just, they had a lot of, a lot of different branches on them.
[59:12.740 --> 59:15.140]  They weren't like classic Christmas tree.
[59:15.140 --> 59:19.700]  It was like many different branches, but the biomass was like incredibly heavy.
[59:19.700 --> 59:27.220]  And they had just, I saw them like, oh man, it was late, early, no, no, early August.
[59:27.220 --> 59:27.700]  That's right.
[59:28.260 --> 59:29.700]  Mid-August, mid-August.
[59:30.260 --> 59:32.820]  And they were heading up pretty good.
[59:33.380 --> 59:38.260]  They just started, like they had like about two weeks of flowering, it seemed, or that's
[59:38.260 --> 59:40.900]  what the flower stage looked like, but they were auto.
[59:40.900 --> 59:42.260]  So yeah.
[59:42.260 --> 59:47.700]  Anyway, you can, yeah, you can page through a little bit.
[59:47.700 --> 59:54.900]  A lot of these, okay, the photo on the left, that was taken by Justin or what's his left
[59:54.900 --> 59:55.140]  foot.
[59:55.780 --> 01:00:01.300]  He's in the, he's done all kinds of covers for high times and stuff.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.100]  And the one on the right was Gonzo photos.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.260]  But yeah, the one with Clint, yeah, and that's Gonzo photos too.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.260]  The one, the further down are the ones with Clint.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:21.220]  He's this guy, guy with the beard, kind of a bluish green top, Levi's, standing there.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:22.500]  Okay.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:29.700]  And for anybody who is just joining us or joined a little bit late, I just want to reiterate,
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:35.220]  right now we're scrolling through the new book from Jorge Cervantes, and this is available
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.620]  as a free digital download.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:41.780]  So that's, you know, it's early Christmas time here is what I'll call that.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.500]  You can find it down in the show notes.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.580]  Oh, here's some more of the auto flowering feminized seeds or pictures.
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.260]  But yeah, find the link down in the show notes and download your copy.
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:52.900]  It's free.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:53.460]  There we go.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.820]  This is what we're looking for, right?
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.140]  Yeah.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:55.540]  Okay.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.260]  Here we go.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:56.580]  Okay.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:04.580]  There's a, this is Ben Rogers, a friend of mine, good friend of mine, Steve Rogers, his
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:04.820]  son.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:05.940]  Yeah.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:06.660]  He's out there.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.820]  These are all CBD plants on the right.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.500]  And that's in Oregon, but here's plant on the left.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.900]  And these are these auto flower plants.
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:21.140]  And they're not very old, like, you know, two and two months, two and a half months
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:21.460]  old.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.780]  And they are just huge.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:29.940]  And I saw quite a few auto flower plants that were huge.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.820]  And I don't, you know, Clint knows what to do with them.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.220]  He's found all kinds of things.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:41.700]  This is, and this is just, this is one of these fields here, but these autos are going
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.900]  to turn into something.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.700]  And we've got people that really know what they're doing that look for all kinds of
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.620]  different traits with the plants too.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.140]  So I'm really looking forward to stuff.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:02:00.020]  And that's, yeah, that's probably where the, the buddies budget goes is all the testing
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.940]  for these minor cannabinoids.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.500]  Yes.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.060]  Yes.
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:03.300]  Yeah.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.580]  Yeah, it does.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.180]  Well, he's looking for specific stuff, but yeah, this, and this all explains things,
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.420]  you know, like in, in real simple terms.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:17.540]  So people can understand, because I think people get sometimes mixed up the, the feminized
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.660]  auto and, and regular or photo period.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.900]  I could have called those photo period plants, I guess.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.140]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.660]  And industrial hemp, you know, this is all industrial hemp here.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.100]  I mean, it kind of looks like it.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:31.460]  Yeah.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.780]  It's still a beautiful site.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.060]  Not quite the same smoke.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.020]  No, no much different.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:43.940]  And then here, this one, actually that one, the photo there with a freak show, the cannabis
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:51.300]  highly serrated leaves that was, that was taken up in well, just North of Barcelona
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.100]  in Alaya.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:53.540]  Yeah.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.420]  A friend of mine's grown.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.620]  He had like a, but two and a half.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.060]  No, no.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:02:59.860]  Just yeah.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.980]  Two and a half acres, almost three acres under, under, under cover there.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:05.780]  Wow.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:11.300]  And yeah, just a freak show is one of those ones I recommend everybody grow it.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.100]  This is, it's got dog slobber on it, but the morphology is so cool that you'll frame it.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.580]  I'm just going to say that like, dude, everybody's got to do it once at least enjoy yourself.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:21.700]  Yeah.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:28.660]  There was a guy that developed it in God, Northern California, Trinity County or somewhere
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.380]  there.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.460]  Really, really quite interesting.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:32.260]  Yeah.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:38.500]  And he's done well and it's kind of an anomaly, you know, it doesn't, it's not the highest
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.860]  high and stuff, but it looks really cool.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.100]  Yeah, it is.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.860]  It's, it's fun to have in the garden again.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:50.180]  You know, we love being the shadow but that one you're, you're going to stare out a little
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:50.660]  bit more.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.420]  And like I said, you'll frame it.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.100]  You'll, you'll pluck a few, you'll frame it.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:00.660]  Kind of curious about, you know, different strains though, you were mentioning like Acapulco
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:06.820]  gold earlier and a few of these other, you know, older, I guess, land races might be
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:07.460]  the right term.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.700]  But yeah, yeah.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.380]  Those were all land races for sure.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:18.980]  But what, and now I've had what I have been told is like Acapulco gold, but I am not convinced
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.740]  that I've ever truly had it.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:26.260]  Are, are some of these strains things that you've seen like in the current market or
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.380]  No, no, you never see that stuff.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.900]  I mean, and I wouldn't believe it if it, if it came here, you know what I mean?
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.460]  Right.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:38.660]  But what the hell happens, you know, I'll have to see it like on location or, or real
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:44.340]  close by or, or talk to somebody that rode the donkey in the town or something, you know,
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:49.780]  but because of, yeah, it's cause see what's happened.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:57.620]  Is all these well-meaning growers have gone out and disseminated cannabis seeds to improve
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:02.820]  the gene pool and it's kind of like polluted it overall.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.620]  Cause I, I saw it.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:13.540]  Well, I spent, I spent a few months in Columbia and with growers and, you know, was out in
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.740]  the field a lot.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:23.220]  And gosh, I mean, they got up to a threshold of about 12% and they can't seem to go beyond
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.180]  that for, for the, the cannabis there.
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:31.700]  And they've got like half a dozen, well, four main varieties and eight or 10 other
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.460]  ones all the, or all together.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:42.340]  And they propagate things mainly through clones and grow well, all year round.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:53.380]  They can, depends on where you're at, but it's, it's kind of like the genes that they,
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:59.540]  they only arrive to one level and they, they top out there and they get homogeneous here.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:02.740]  They, they don't keep getting richer.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.240]  Okay.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:05.220]  Yeah.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:12.100]  I think in, in the whole world and it's, it's unique here with the cannabis you know, like
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:17.460]  for example, if we, if we look at peppers, for example, peppers, there's been, you know,
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.540]  peppers are a staple.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:27.780]  They're all over the world and stuff, but nobody went out and took pepper seeds and
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.740]  went out to cross them intentionally with all the other peppers on all, on the other
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.380]  continents.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:40.420]  So, so what happened is like about 20 years ago when peppers started getting like super,
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:49.380]  super interesting and stuff for people, they started finding new ones, new land races out
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:53.860]  in the wild and in people's backyards or ones they didn't know about.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:07:01.700]  But that's because the whole gene pool wasn't all fucked up and see, that's what's happened
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.980]  with the cannabis.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:14.420]  They got all these, these, these quote unquote, really bad hybrids mixed in with the gene.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:22.580]  So it's, it, it, it's you don't find, it makes it more difficult to find new and interesting
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.860]  genetic material.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:29.620]  It's getting bottlenecks, you know, the, cause again, we're, we're, yeah, we're making the
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.260]  selection.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:35.460]  So we are, and that's kind of how a lot of people thought about CBD before we knew what
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.260]  CBD was.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.900]  People are like, well, this plant doesn't really make me that stone.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.580]  I'm no, you don't make the cut.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.020]  I'm going for this one.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:44.900]  And then eventually things just became THC dominant.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.340]  And now we're trying to reverse that.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:47.460]  Yeah.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.260]  Reverse engineer it.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:58.260]  In fact, I remember in the eighties, yeah, late eight, mid late eighties, I had a, we
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:04.420]  had volunteer plants that were CBD rich and had no clue what they were not.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:12.820]  I mean, just like no high dope and yeah, it was the strangest thing, not a clue.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.860]  Didn't want to have anything to do with it.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.060]  It was just weird.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.900]  Yeah.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.220]  Yeah.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:19.460]  Yeah.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:24.500]  But that was in the eighties and, and who was, well, this is also in the book.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.260]  It's a interesting statistic.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:35.540]  Oh, Samantha Miller from, uh, uh, pure analytics in Santa Rosa, California.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:44.900]  Uh, she started doing tests cause she, she would go through a lot of cannabis, a lot,
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.500]  make a lot of cannabis tests.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:56.180]  And she found even when it was all dominant THC plants that one out of 500 had plants
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.700]  that she tested at a dominant TH or I mean, CBDG.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:00.740]  Oh, wow.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:01.880]  Yeah.
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:03.940]  Yeah.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.180]  And, and so that's really quite a bit.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:14.820]  And, uh, now it's much, the incidence is much higher, you know, but, um, it's got to be
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.620]  extrapolated out.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.780]  We're going to see a whole bunch more stuff too.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.300]  Not just like with breeches, you know, like backyard breeders.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:25.780]  And also, I mean, breeders have done quite a bit more stuff now because they, they, they
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:29.460]  can select from the larger populations and stuff.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:35.300]  Uh, they can grow more out, but there's also a lot of scientists that are interested in
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:35.620]  this.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:41.780]  There's like, you know, that company pure gene over in, in, uh, Switzerland.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:46.740]  I went over to visit them and boy, they're, uh, they're really advanced.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.100]  Um, yeah, they're in Shenoga.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:50.500]  Yeah.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.700]  And, uh, several other companies as well.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.820]  They're quite advanced.
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:10:01.700]  So I think we're going to see some incredibly strong, um, varieties come out, but mainly
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:07.140]  for agriculture, because that's what those guys care about.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.740]  That's where the real money's at.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:15.700]  You know, you make a lot more selling a 50 pound bag of seeds than you do, uh, selling,
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.820]  you know, like a thousand impact.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:20.740]  Yeah.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:25.540]  You know, in, especially in the markets here, I've, you know, I've like joked, but I'm
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.620]  serious when I say a seeded plant is worth more than a non-seeded plant.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:30.760]  Much more.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:31.620]  Yep.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.500]  Much more.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.180]  So you can produce a ton of seeds on a plant.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:36.580]  Yeah.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.660]  So I'd like to see more people do seeds.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.060]  I mean, we we've done clones for so long because it's convenient.
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.100]  And, but now seeds are legal in the United States.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.940]  They're, they're legal under the hemp rule.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:59.220]  And, you know, a lot of people are steering away from clones because there's a, the HPOV,
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:05.220]  the hop latent viroid, uh, there there's been mosaic virus was the original version.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:10.020]  Now it's shifted to this and, you know, it might shift to another culprit, but a clone
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:15.380]  seemed to be what is passing these things along that ultimately will just dud your crop.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:19.380]  And I, you know, again, in the book here, you've got your disease pests and problem
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.380]  section, which is invaluable.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.820]  Everybody read that part twice.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.120]  Yeah.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.000]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:31.700]  I just touch on stuff pretty quick here because the whole big thing is prevention and setting
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.300]  stuff up properly.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.980]  If you do that, then you can track everything you, you need.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:43.220]  Um, yeah, but that age of him latent virus, man, that's a, that's a bad one.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:51.700]  I talked to my friend, uh, Alex over he's got flowery fields in, in Austria and he does
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.620]  tissue culture and he can get rid of it with tissue culture.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.340]  But he said, it's been a real big problem.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.780]  It's been a big problem here in Europe.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.180]  And I know it's been a big problem in America as well.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:06.820]  And it's a sneaks in and you don't really, you can't really idea.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:08.980]  Right.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.220]  It's, it's, you know, sometimes it's active.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.460]  Other times it's not, there's been, um, people who have tested for it here.
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:19.380]  They found it in their plants, but that plant's been running for seven years and it's still
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.580]  going strong.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:25.700]  They do their best to, you know, isolate it, uh, not, you know, use tools from one plant
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:30.820]  to the next, but, uh, they're like, you know, until it, you know, until it's cruise this
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.580]  line up, I'm not losing this line.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:37.460]  No, what you have to do is give it to somebody like Alex at flowery field.
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.260]  And then, uh, uh, they take a tip cuttings out of it.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:43.300]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:48.260]  You can click on this, this drawing and you go to the website that shows all the photos
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.940]  bigger and everything.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:50.500]  So they're easy.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:50.980]  Wow.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:51.540]  Look at that.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:52.600]  Yeah.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.500]  So they're a lot easier to see.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.100]  And yeah, cause otherwise it gives you a headache.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:12:59.620]  Thank you.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.740]  No, this is that's, that's one that I usually look at a lot.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:08.420]  Uh, this is gosh, this, this, this chart needs to be standard in everybody's grow room.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:09.220]  It is in mine.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.540]  So put it right next to your VPD chart people.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.300]  Yeah.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.460]  Gosh, that's a, that's a good chart.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.820]  Oh yeah.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.940]  Always, you know, again, education is the best and knowing, and that's another thing
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.420]  I appreciate about your books as well.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.460]  It's written in a way that's easy to understand.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.700]  Like the practical application is there.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:34.740]  And, and just, I, I'm really, I'm like in love with how you can, you know, a, just go
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.380]  to the table of contents, click on it.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.540]  And then also, you know, keyword search.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:39.860]  Okay.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.340]  I'm curious about magnesium.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.620]  Let's just type that in.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.180]  And, you know, it's just like, get all of the references to that in the book.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.900]  So those things are awesome.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:52.420]  It gives you a whole list of that stuff.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.100]  It's, it's really easy.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:14:03.940]  I see one of the things as a writer, I have to remember, I cannot lose people.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.100]  They got to stay with me.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.220]  And if I lose them, well, it's my fault.
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:15.540]  So that's why I have to develop a writing style that keeps people engaged.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:22.740]  And then also just me as a person, I like reading stuff where I learn stuff in every
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.260]  sentence, everything has to teach me something.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.260]  Otherwise I get frustrated or bored.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.300]  So that's the way I write.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.460]  So there's, there's content here.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:37.620]  It doesn't just make you feel good.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.620]  You learn something while you feel good.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:41.380]  Yep.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.220]  And that is very important.
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:48.820]  I know we're, you know, I can go all day, but I know it is in the evening for you.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:50.260]  So we're getting close.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:50.500]  Yeah.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.100]  It's like a seven 20.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.500]  So yeah, I'm out here at the beach.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.420]  I got to go back into town.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:57.220]  Oh, okay.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.500]  Back an hour.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:14:59.220]  Yeah.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.980]  Well, a couple, a couple more questions, if you don't mind.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.380]  I really appreciate your time.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.900]  This has been an awesome conversation.
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:08.340]  Oh, no worries.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.380]  I hope it doesn't ramble too much.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.060]  No, no, I'm going to, I'm going to be that weird guy and go back and watch my own show
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:18.180]  because I'll enjoy it just as much as a spectator, I think.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:21.460]  So a couple, couple of questions that we had though.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.940]  One was from dog days, gardens.
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.780]  I saw him in chat a little bit earlier.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:31.540]  He was curious if you had any information about G 13, which was a strain.
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.060]  No, no, man.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.660]  I remember Neville came over.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:42.740]  I knew Neville quite well and he helped him, but I remember he came over to America.
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.140]  My mother liked him.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.740]  She never liked any of my friends.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.420]  I couldn't believe she liked Neville.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:48.740]  Fuck.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.580]  It's who I was.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:53.380]  He's accent.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:16:04.340]  It was the accent, but, but anyway, yeah, he bought, he bought that, that one from,
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:12.260]  well, I won't say who, well, it doesn't really matter, but anyway, he bought G 13 and they
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:15.860]  thought it was G 13, but nobody's really run this down.
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.700]  I don't know if it ever exists.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:22.740]  I, my, my thought is it doesn't really exist.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.580]  Nobody's proved anything.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:30.020]  One of my friends, Colin Montgomery is running down a lot of stuff.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:37.220]  And actually he'd be a, he's real interesting guy, but G 13, I don't know.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:40.180]  I think it's all stories and stuff.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:46.180]  And, and I've got a question for you that have just been kind of stories throughout
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:46.660]  my life.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:53.780]  And it's, it's interesting to me because I've met another reader in this state who has been
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.940]  doing it for at least 20 years, I would say probably 30 years.
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:03.620]  And, you know, talking with him and hearing the stories, we had to have been like one
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:07.860]  degree separated this entire time, but he also kind of knew the story.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:13.940]  I don't know if you ever heard of a story or a strain that like escaped or was released
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.940]  from the university of Washington.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:21.620]  Like there's a lot of lore in the Pacific Northwest about this U-Dub strain that was
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.300]  like smuggled out of the lab.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:29.620]  And I do remember when something special hit the streets and it was supposedly this thing.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:30.420]  Yeah.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:34.500]  I have heard about that too, but I just don't know anything.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:43.460]  It's somebody, and, and, but see, I, I, I know Steve, Steve Murphy.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.740]  He's a good friend.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:47.460]  He has the, the indoor sun shop.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:47.700]  Yeah.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.260]  That was the first growth store in America.
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.060]  Wow.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:52.340]  Yeah.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.780]  And he's pretty old now.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.740]  His son, Sean runs it though.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:58.660]  Yeah.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.580]  It's over, it's over in Ballard.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:01.060]  Ballard.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:01.860]  That's right.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.780]  I always hang out over in Ballard.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.220]  I love it.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:08.740]  Well, I know everybody over there, you know, I mean.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.300]  Ballard.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:10.580]  Yeah.
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:10.900]  Yeah.
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.260]  Ballard definitely.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:12.900]  Yeah.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.540]  It's nice.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:22.340]  Boy, I, I'll keep it in the back of my mind, but I do not know anything about it.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:22.660]  Yeah.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.780]  No problem.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:28.180]  It was a shot in the dark because, you know, here I am 20 years later and I still don't know.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.020]  Who's going to know?
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:33.780]  Right.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:40.500]  That's a couple of people should, but I, I mean, it wasn't on the Colin, Colin's list,
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.020]  Colin Montgomery's list.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.940]  So yeah, he asked me about others.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.380]  That's a whole other subject.
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:48.500]  Yeah.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.060]  He kind of like found out most of the stuff.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:55.540]  So I got to tell him to, to tell that.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:19:02.260]  So he gets kind of like, he has all the straight story and I don't, you know, I didn't do all
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:04.260]  the research, so I don't have the straight story.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:05.380]  Right.
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.940]  Fair, fair answer there.
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.700]  And let's see here.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:16.740]  I'm going to get one more question up here that came in and it actually will lead into
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.140]  another question I have myself.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:26.180]  Well, actually, bud washing, that is something that, you know, we we've seen in your book
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.900]  and that's something in the Pacific Northwest because of the last few years, wildfires,
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.780]  ash and everything.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:34.740]  This is something that I have been asked about a lot.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.340]  They're like, well, how do you do it?
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:38.340]  And I always refer people to you.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.380]  I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.780]  Cora Cervantes, bud washing, Google it, do it.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.140]  Yeah.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:43.460]  Yeah.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.500]  It works really well.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.500]  You know, just like you take lettuce, you wash it off.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.020]  It's got the dirt on it and then you dry it out.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:54.020]  Yep.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:54.420]  Yep.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.500]  So it's a scary thing though.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.780]  It's a scary thing.
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:58.340]  Not so much.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:06.820]  Because, excuse me, because you use, swish it around.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.700]  You don't want to like rub it, like be abrasive.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:12.100]  You can swish it around.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:17.620]  And in fact, you could even use like one of those sprinkler type things, you know, that
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:21.780]  just uses water to do it.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.380]  But you don't need to do that.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:26.980]  You just need to agitate it a little bit.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:31.780]  But it's not hard at all on the resin glands at all.
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:38.100]  And then, so you do that and then you shake it off and, you know, you don't do it violently,
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:42.980]  just shake it off and then hang it and put a fan on it and it dries right out.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:47.060]  It dries right out and it's not a problem.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.140]  And then after that, you can process it.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:58.500]  But it's, you just, you just got to have the proper conditions afterwards.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:02.740]  But yeah, once you see that scum, that scum there like that.
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:03.240]  Yes.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:07.140]  You will be convinced.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:07.700]  It's like, ooh.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.060]  Yeah.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:09.620]  Sold.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.100]  Okay.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.060]  Makes you think twice.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:11.220]  Yeah.
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:16.180]  I had a buddy who made a video to do that, to again, look at the, you know, the trichome
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:20.420]  heads, everything, as you said, and he set it up like you recommended as well.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:24.340]  And he actually reported that it dried faster, which I was like, wait a minute, you dunked
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.020]  it and it actually dried faster than normal.
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:29.540]  But a couple of days here and there will, you know, a couple of days is a couple of
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:30.500]  days to a grower.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.380]  That's a long time.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.100]  So yeah.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.820]  I never checked to see if it grew, if it dried faster or not.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.460]  It very well.
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:37.940]  I don't know.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.900]  Oh, that's a good thing about sharing information.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:42.260]  See, I learned stuff there.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:42.900]  Yes.
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:43.540]  Okay.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:47.860]  And then to the actual question here, it says, it says, do you think the cannabis industry
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:52.500]  has room for aged, fermented, or buds cured and aged properly?
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:58.740]  Probably not fermented, but properly cured buds for a year or more kind of like specialty
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.980]  products like tobacco, wine, or alcohols.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:11.940]  Boy, maybe, you know, there's, go put it on the market and see, I mean, it's not the first
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.620]  thing I would look for.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:18.740]  I know a guy where Nick was, I think it was in Netherlands.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.900]  He gave me, they do this in the tropics.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.100]  It was the tropics.
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:26.340]  Yeah.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:30.580]  But it was like a corn husks.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:35.540]  It was cannabis rolled in corn husk or bamboo or something and squeezed.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:36.420]  Yeah.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.340]  I was, I couldn't take it back with me.
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:38.580]  Right.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:39.460]  It was in Netherlands.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.540]  And so, and it was squeezed, squeezed together.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.460]  But I mean, to me, it was, I don't know.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:54.180]  The reason they did all of that stuff to begin with was to preserve it.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:23:01.940]  So it had lasted for a while when you carried it, that was the idea with everything to condense
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:02.100]  it.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.860]  So maybe, I don't know.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.180]  Yeah.
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.220]  But I'd like to say, oh yeah, sure.
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:11.140]  I have no idea.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:15.220]  I would go see if people would buy it.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.700]  Yeah.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:21.220]  And that's just off the top of my head too.
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:22.260]  I'm a big flower guy.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:23.460]  I love my flower.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:28.500]  I see that maybe applying more to hash though, because hash does store well.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:29.620]  Oh yeah.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:37.220]  And from Frenchie Cannoli's, the testing and that Madame Cannoli continues, it does look
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.060]  like it continues to get better with time.
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.260]  So that's interesting.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.460]  Again, one of those things like plants, it takes time to know.
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:44.580]  Yeah.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:45.220]  Yeah, it does.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.420]  And yeah, with the hash, see, we get to really good hash here.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.780]  We get to Moroccan hashes.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.280]  Yeah.
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:57.300]  You get the apaleado, the beaten with the stick, or then you get the culero, the butt
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:58.020]  hash, you know.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.180]  Somebody was asking to ask you about butt hash.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.860]  Culero.
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:04.100]  Yeah.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:08.180]  Everybody in the Mediterranean knows culero because it's really good.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.380]  They come in these, they call them acorns, bellota.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:19.220]  It's like 10 grams and it's covered with cellophane, the shrink wrap type stuff.
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.940]  And people swallow them.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:31.700]  You can get, I mean, you can get about two to two and a half pounds in your stomach.
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.740]  It comes up to about here, depends on how big you are.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.380]  And it goes some in your bed.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:37.620]  Yeah.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.860]  And then you can put about a hundred grams up the rectum.
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:48.900]  But the thing is, you have to like afterwards, you have to go sit in the bathtub for a couple
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:53.700]  days, you know, and I'll tell you damn well better count them before they go in.
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.060]  Because you gotta count them when they come out.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.260]  These are practical matters here.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:05.400]  Yeah.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.460]  Olive oil, drink a lot of olive oil.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.020]  Oh man.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.700]  I am thankful for legal cannabis.
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.000]  Yeah.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:18.180]  Yeah.
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:23.140]  But they only make the best cannabis, the culero, you know.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:24.920]  Yeah.
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.780]  And then usually get the placas, the plates of a hundred grams.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.020]  Okay.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:30.660]  Yep.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:31.160]  Yeah.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:32.740]  Yeah.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:32.980]  Wow.
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:36.020]  Well, good, good, good.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:36.420]  Yeah.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.260]  Please download this book.
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:41.460]  Tell we got to tell everybody to download the book, see if you like it.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.460]  And I'd like to know what you think about it.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.500]  You know, good, bad or indifferent.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.060]  But it's a freebie, you know, a little bit of your time.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:52.980]  Easy enough to get.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:56.740]  And I love the guys at Seeds when they're so good to work with.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.420]  I don't know.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:00.900]  I've known Tom for a hell of a long time.
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:01.460]  Yeah.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:01.860]  Awesome.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:08.340]  I've seen a lot of pictures of you lately on your American trip, rocking with the Seedsman gear.
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.740]  And yeah, that's the website to go find this.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:11.220]  Everybody.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.260]  This link is also down in the show notes.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.500]  So find that there.
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:25.140]  Also want to just real quick, you know, Jorge Cervantes, MJ on Instagram and your website as well.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:30.340]  Anything else that you want to let people know of or where to find you before we sign out for the day?
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.540]  Yeah, that's those are the main places.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:36.820]  I'm also on LinkedIn, too.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:40.100]  That's I got to give LinkedIn a plug.
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.380]  I really like LinkedIn.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:43.540]  It's a great professional place to be.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:49.620]  You get real high quality people that are have stuff to talk about.
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.780]  And it's a real pleasant.
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:53.620]  I like it a lot.
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:27:00.180]  A lot of professors, a lot of professionals and people with doctorate degrees that know
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.140]  a lot more than me.
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:01.620]  It's great.
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.620]  And I get to learn from them.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:04.580]  Yes.
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:07.540]  And I'm headed there myself soon, too.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:15.220]  Again, it's another it's another just level of people that I want to learn from and talk with
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:16.580]  and then just be community.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:20.340]  So, yes, I looked briefly in the email in your email.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:25.540]  I didn't see it, but just I imagine if people Google Google or hey, Cervantes LinkedIn, it'll
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:26.020]  pop up.
