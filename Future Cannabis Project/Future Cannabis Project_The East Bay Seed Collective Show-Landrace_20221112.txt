[00:00.250 --> 00:05.570]  All right, good morning, everyone.
[00:05.570 --> 00:10.610]  Welcome to the East Bay ASEED Collective show.
[00:10.610 --> 00:15.130]  Saturday morning, it's nine o'clock.
[00:15.130 --> 00:18.930]  Today we have an awesome guest, Landrace Bureau is coming on.
[00:18.930 --> 00:23.730]  I just sent him his invite, so he should be in a second.
[00:23.730 --> 00:25.850]  But yeah, it's a good day.
[00:25.850 --> 00:28.090]  It's nice and sunny out here in California.
[00:28.090 --> 00:33.850]  Got a lot of fun stuff to talk about.
[00:33.850 --> 00:39.650]  My focus is on outdoor and so this is a pretty fun time of year
[00:39.650 --> 00:45.010]  because there's just tons and tons of outdoor to try and
[00:45.010 --> 00:50.530]  to trim and to kind of look into what you've been growing for
[00:50.530 --> 00:55.250]  the past six months and how it's all looking.
[00:55.250 --> 00:58.370]  So it's a really exciting time of year for me.
[00:58.370 --> 01:02.410]  I'm really curious in the chat, what you guys have been growing,
[01:02.410 --> 01:04.090]  what you're really liking this year.
[01:05.250 --> 01:10.050]  For me, I've probably said this multiple times, but our year was so nice.
[01:10.050 --> 01:13.330]  Pretty much everything came out better than expected.
[01:13.330 --> 01:14.730]  Everything came out really nice.
[01:16.090 --> 01:19.810]  So I feel super blessed.
[01:19.810 --> 01:23.410]  Definitely for me, the gassy stuff came out really, really nice this year.
[01:23.410 --> 01:25.930]  The sour came out nice, the pure kush came out nice,
[01:25.930 --> 01:27.570]  the diesel came out really nice.
[01:27.570 --> 01:30.530]  TK chem dog came out good.
[01:32.410 --> 01:35.170]  The fruity stuff came out really good.
[01:35.170 --> 01:38.210]  The main free stuff I did this year was the Hanalei so that I mean,
[01:38.210 --> 01:41.610]  I would kind of now consider that almost like a sativa,
[01:41.610 --> 01:48.090]  urkel, like a purple flavor on like a really big frame plant.
[01:48.090 --> 01:50.770]  Those all came out really good this year.
[01:50.810 --> 01:54.810]  So yeah, I've been really juiced and been lucky.
[01:54.810 --> 01:59.010]  I mean, my only real complaint is everything is so strong.
[01:59.010 --> 02:01.650]  It just puts me down and I'm sleepy.
[02:02.730 --> 02:05.850]  So that's the only downside.
[02:05.850 --> 02:11.450]  And then like today, actually, I wanted to go into a couple of things.
[02:11.450 --> 02:15.290]  A couple of things, well, I wanted to go into one thing,
[02:15.290 --> 02:18.570]  which is effects of cannabis.
[02:18.570 --> 02:22.690]  Because that is the, I mean, there's many different reasons why people
[02:22.690 --> 02:27.690]  consume cannabis, but one of the most basic ones is the effect.
[02:27.690 --> 02:33.410]  And so today I really wanted to go into three of your favorite effects,
[02:33.410 --> 02:36.970]  and three of your most favorite effects, and three of your least favorite effects.
[02:38.730 --> 02:41.210]  Dani's saying I need the stronger stuff.
[02:41.210 --> 02:44.330]  Well, for me, I mean, the reason the stuff was stronger is because the weather was so
[02:44.330 --> 02:47.810]  nice, I just left it on the branch longer.
[02:47.970 --> 02:50.930]  The longer you leave it out, the stronger it gets.
[02:50.930 --> 02:56.770]  And then up to a certain point, then it starts to get sleepy.
[02:56.770 --> 02:58.010]  But hey, good morning, Nick.
[02:59.810 --> 03:02.530]  But yeah, that's in my opinion how to make stuff stronger.
[03:02.530 --> 03:09.250]  I mean, besides the genetics, the next thing is how long you leave it out there.
[03:09.250 --> 03:14.730]  And also how long you're able to leave your plants out there is a little bit,
[03:14.730 --> 03:17.490]  it's not just as simple as just leaving it out there longer.
[03:18.210 --> 03:23.530]  It's really about having your plant healthy enough that you can leave it out
[03:23.530 --> 03:28.410]  long enough that it will mature and finish.
[03:28.410 --> 03:31.330]  So that means not having crazy amounts of powdered mildew,
[03:31.330 --> 03:37.010]  it means not having tons of bug pressures, not having botrytis.
[03:37.010 --> 03:43.250]  All of those things put pressure on your plant, your plant's health,
[03:43.250 --> 03:47.810]  your immune system, its health, so that it can't finish how it would like to.
[03:47.810 --> 03:50.570]  It can't finish to its full potential and
[03:50.570 --> 03:52.730]  often when those things happen, you have to cut early.
[03:54.730 --> 04:00.930]  So getting your stuff to go longer goes into a lot of other things.
[04:00.930 --> 04:06.250]  So the same thing, I'm moving between repros of a bunch of stuff.
[04:08.530 --> 04:11.010]  Wild ones, newer hype streams.
[04:11.010 --> 04:14.690]  Interesting, yeah, I mean, please let me know in the chat,
[04:14.690 --> 04:17.450]  what are some things that you guys like that did well this year?
[04:17.450 --> 04:20.610]  I'm always, always curious about things that are doing well and
[04:20.610 --> 04:22.170]  that things that people like.
[04:22.170 --> 04:24.770]  I'm also curious about hype stuff that's doing well.
[04:24.770 --> 04:30.770]  I mean, I'm definitely not into as much of the hype stuff,
[04:30.770 --> 04:35.290]  but I got some clones from somebody and I had some hype stuff in there.
[04:35.290 --> 04:40.530]  I did not give it the attention it deserved and it came out really nice.
[04:40.570 --> 04:41.410]  It came out good.
[04:41.410 --> 04:43.250]  It was some soap.
[04:43.250 --> 04:46.770]  I think it was called soap, which is like some kind of cookies,
[04:46.770 --> 04:48.450]  Cushman's cross, I believe.
[04:48.450 --> 04:54.970]  It was basically just like a taller plant, kind of looked like sherb.
[04:56.970 --> 05:02.210]  Great quality, pretty dense, really nice crystals.
[05:03.650 --> 05:04.850]  And strong, it was potent.
[05:04.890 --> 05:10.130]  So we definitely, people will diss the hype stuff, but
[05:10.130 --> 05:14.810]  my opinion is you diss it until it's proven wrong.
[05:14.810 --> 05:19.170]  Once it's proven, then it's not hype, then it's good.
[05:20.450 --> 05:25.890]  Soap and soap is getting popular, but yeah, people like the smell of soap.
[05:25.890 --> 05:27.090]  Yeah, I mean, that's exactly the same.
[05:27.090 --> 05:33.770]  The smell of the soap, I don't know if it was for sure soapy smell.
[05:35.090 --> 05:38.370]  But I mean, it was good.
[05:38.370 --> 05:42.050]  It's good, it's frosty, it looks really nice.
[05:42.050 --> 05:44.330]  I mean, that's important, it looks nice in a bag.
[05:44.330 --> 05:45.810]  Yeah, is that sea junkie?
[05:47.690 --> 05:51.610]  I'm not particularly a fan of sea junkie, but
[05:51.610 --> 05:54.530]  if the bud is good, the bud's good.
[05:54.530 --> 05:58.170]  I mean, that's kind of where I'm at.
[05:58.170 --> 06:01.210]  There's a million reasons to hate on tons of people, but
[06:01.210 --> 06:02.210]  we're here to grow the plant.
[06:02.250 --> 06:07.650]  So had a new strain and developed that's sativicide, but really sweet and dank.
[06:07.650 --> 06:14.530]  Cool, Danny, what is in that variety that you developed?
[06:14.530 --> 06:16.010]  I'm curious.
[06:16.010 --> 06:19.970]  Some of my best bud is from bag seed even though I got some quality seeds.
[06:19.970 --> 06:22.490]  Interesting, it's funny, I'm actually,
[06:22.490 --> 06:24.770]  I'm not a big proponent of popping bag seeds.
[06:28.210 --> 06:30.410]  I mean, if the weed is good, I'll smoke it.
[06:30.450 --> 06:36.890]  And if I have a buddy, Hughie Jack, he's popped some bag seeds and
[06:36.890 --> 06:38.730]  found some really awesome stuff.
[06:38.730 --> 06:43.810]  And I've grown those lines and they were good.
[06:43.810 --> 06:45.730]  It was just as good as anything else.
[06:45.730 --> 06:51.410]  So it just kind of takes a little leap of faith because
[06:51.410 --> 06:54.530]  there are a lot of herbs in bag seed.
[06:55.050 --> 07:01.450]  Yeah, this person, Sea Junkie, got a lot of flack earlier this year.
[07:01.450 --> 07:04.050]  Yeah, I'm the third part, yeah.
[07:04.050 --> 07:09.250]  Yeah, exactly, I mean, there's some stuff going on with Sea Junkie.
[07:09.250 --> 07:13.850]  But yeah, I grew a couple plants and I'll smoke them and they're legit.
[07:13.850 --> 07:20.290]  There are a lot of breeders that people agree or
[07:20.330 --> 07:23.050]  disagree with their practices, but
[07:23.050 --> 07:28.330]  we just gotta keep it real as far as the quality of the product.
[07:28.330 --> 07:34.330]  What is this, Lugo is saying, successfully cloned some non-hybridized Punta Roja.
[07:34.330 --> 07:36.210]  I grew some of that last year.
[07:36.210 --> 07:40.650]  Cuz we're taking earlier flowering, yeah, took forever.
[07:40.650 --> 07:43.930]  Yeah, no, the Punta Roja is an interesting one.
[07:43.930 --> 07:47.170]  I'm curious who you got your Punta Roja from.
[07:47.170 --> 07:48.890]  I got mine from Snow High.
[07:50.410 --> 07:54.610]  I like the Punta Roja, it had a really interesting high to it,
[07:54.610 --> 07:57.330]  it has really interesting smell to it.
[07:57.330 --> 08:01.970]  It had the phenose that I kept of the Punta Roja smelled like a juice box,
[08:01.970 --> 08:04.010]  like the air out of a juice box.
[08:04.010 --> 08:08.610]  If you drank all the juice, then you're just kind of sucking in the box and
[08:08.610 --> 08:12.690]  you could taste that flavored kind of fruit punchy type of thing.
[08:12.690 --> 08:17.250]  That's the smell that I got from my Punta Roja.
[08:17.410 --> 08:21.410]  It was super kind of airy and kind of spongy.
[08:23.650 --> 08:28.050]  It was really interesting, it was definitely different, some different weed.
[08:28.050 --> 08:30.450]  Why was this person in my back seat hash?
[08:30.450 --> 08:31.970]  I bought an ounce of seed.
[08:34.370 --> 08:36.170]  Bought an ounce of seed in the bud.
[08:37.330 --> 08:39.890]  Interesting, yeah, I mean, it depends where you live.
[08:39.890 --> 08:44.210]  A lot of people, if there's seed in their bud, they're like, great,
[08:44.210 --> 08:45.690]  that's what they're gonna grow.
[08:46.010 --> 08:52.170]  I mean, that's how OG Kush and Chemdog and probably a lot of other strains were
[08:52.170 --> 08:54.090]  found and discovered was through backseats.
[08:56.730 --> 09:01.210]  Sea Junkie, yeah, people aren't buying $500 packs of seeds anymore.
[09:01.210 --> 09:01.930]  Yeah, exactly.
[09:04.730 --> 09:08.330]  Yeah, I mean, not really many people are buying packs of seeds for 500 bucks.
[09:10.010 --> 09:14.330]  I mean, you should be able to find a good pack for 100 bucks, maybe 200 bucks.
[09:15.210 --> 09:17.930]  But there are many packs that are good for 50 or 60 bucks.
[09:19.530 --> 09:22.890]  The bubblegum I did, I got from a friend in Michigan.
[09:22.890 --> 09:23.850]  Oh, interesting.
[09:23.850 --> 09:25.050]  So I did some bubblegum this year.
[09:25.050 --> 09:27.850]  I did some bubblegum from THC, it's Adam Dunn.
[09:27.850 --> 09:32.250]  It was a Bubblegum S1 and it's really nice phenol.
[09:32.250 --> 09:35.770]  I like it, it came out really frosty, really dank.
[09:35.770 --> 09:39.130]  My only complaint is that it did not have bubblegum terp.
[09:39.130 --> 09:42.650]  So I'm a little not sure how I wanna move forward with it.
[09:42.810 --> 09:44.010]  I really wanna breed with it.
[09:44.010 --> 09:48.570]  I think it's really nice meds, but I'm not sure how I wanna name it.
[09:48.570 --> 09:51.690]  Because if you called it bubblegum, people might be a little disappointed.
[09:51.690 --> 09:55.050]  So Danny, does yours have bubblegum terps to it?
[09:55.610 --> 09:58.730]  Maybe if you grow it indoors, maybe it has better bubblegum terps.
[09:58.730 --> 10:00.170]  That could be a possibility.
[10:00.170 --> 10:04.010]  Got some flowers from this farm's called Talagani.
[10:07.530 --> 10:08.170]  Very sweet.
[10:09.210 --> 10:11.290]  Talagani.
[10:11.290 --> 10:12.970]  I wonder where Talagani is.
[10:12.970 --> 10:19.450]  I'm not familiar with where that's located, Magnum Opus.
[10:22.410 --> 10:26.490]  Yeah, grew out a few afterglows from Irie.
[10:26.490 --> 10:29.050]  One of them is, it's cool.
[10:29.050 --> 10:31.370]  Is that from Irie Seeds?
[10:31.370 --> 10:33.450]  I remember Irie Genetics.
[10:33.450 --> 10:37.210]  Yeah, I remember he's had podcasts from a long, long time ago.
[10:37.210 --> 10:38.970]  He had a podcast called Grow From Your Heart.
[10:38.970 --> 10:40.410]  He might still have that podcast.
[10:41.850 --> 10:43.770]  Yeah, Big Up Irie Genetics.
[10:43.770 --> 10:46.090]  That was really awesome that he had a podcast.
[10:46.090 --> 10:47.610]  I mean, he's been doing podcasts.
[10:47.610 --> 10:49.050]  It's been a really long time.
[10:49.050 --> 10:51.610]  And he seemed like, I mean, I don't know that guy,
[10:51.610 --> 10:55.690]  but he seemed like a super genuinely nice person
[10:55.690 --> 10:59.290]  who was really breaking down what he did in his work.
[10:59.290 --> 11:00.730]  And I really respect that.
[11:00.730 --> 11:01.770]  That was awesome.
[11:01.770 --> 11:03.050]  Had a line for about 30 years.
[11:03.050 --> 11:04.890]  Smells like licorice, cherry, pine.
[11:04.890 --> 11:08.490]  Yeah, there's also a male vinegar phenome looking for Big Ups.
[11:09.450 --> 11:11.050]  We're rainy Columbia.
[11:11.050 --> 11:12.330]  Oh, are you from Columbia?
[11:12.330 --> 11:13.210]  That's interesting.
[11:14.810 --> 11:18.970]  In the licorice, cherry, pine.
[11:20.090 --> 11:22.250]  And I've never smelled a vinegar male before.
[11:22.250 --> 11:25.050]  When I, the Hanalei line that I'm working,
[11:25.690 --> 11:30.410]  I believe that there is a Columbian,
[11:30.410 --> 11:31.450]  there's Columbian in there.
[11:31.450 --> 11:33.610]  And I believe I found a Columbian phenome.
[11:35.690 --> 11:38.170]  It has the same smell as all the other phenomes.
[11:38.650 --> 11:42.090]  But it's fairly, it's really larfy.
[11:42.090 --> 11:46.010]  And it's very humidity resistance,
[11:46.010 --> 11:48.090]  like extreme open structure bud.
[11:50.330 --> 11:52.650]  And the most interesting thing about it is it's sterile.
[11:53.290 --> 11:55.770]  And I've tried to pollinate it.
[11:55.770 --> 12:00.090]  I think I'm going on three or four different sets of pollen.
[12:00.650 --> 12:02.570]  And it will not take any pollen.
[12:03.210 --> 12:04.890]  It's completely seedless.
[12:04.890 --> 12:07.850]  It's been grown in seed rooms with, you know,
[12:07.850 --> 12:11.050]  a bunch of other plants that are all, you know, 100% seeded.
[12:12.410 --> 12:13.450]  So that's really interesting.
[12:13.450 --> 12:15.530]  You know, it's a sterile plant.
[12:15.530 --> 12:18.730]  I'm not sure this is the first sterile plant I've come across.
[12:18.730 --> 12:22.970]  I mean, unfortunately, the bud isn't like AAA or whatever.
[12:22.970 --> 12:25.450]  It's probably some of the lowest grade that I grew this year.
[12:26.170 --> 12:29.850]  But, you know, it's an interesting thing to have around.
[12:29.850 --> 12:32.090]  You know, I'm going to see maybe if I can reverse it.
[12:32.730 --> 12:38.890]  And if, you know, perhaps, you know, the pollen will be, you know, will still,
[12:39.850 --> 12:43.690]  perhaps the pollen will be able to impregnate another female.
[12:43.690 --> 12:49.690]  And then therefore those would make some sterile seeds or some sterile plants.
[12:50.250 --> 12:51.370]  But, you know, I don't know.
[12:51.370 --> 12:53.130]  The only way that you can do it is to try it.
[12:53.130 --> 12:55.610]  The bubblegum is more dank.
[12:55.610 --> 12:56.570]  Yeah, cotton candy.
[12:56.570 --> 13:00.730]  Yeah, mine was exactly, I mean, mine was much more like danky flavor.
[13:02.090 --> 13:04.410]  But I mean, shoot, cotton candy is really good.
[13:04.410 --> 13:10.650]  And to me, cotton candy is close to, you know, it's bubblegum-esque for sure.
[13:11.290 --> 13:15.050]  But from your heart, from, yeah, from going strong.
[13:15.050 --> 13:16.170]  Yeah, Ross de Jeff.
[13:16.170 --> 13:17.290]  Yeah, yeah, no, he is cool.
[13:18.730 --> 13:23.450]  I remember like back then it was like Ross de Jeff, Subcool,
[13:25.530 --> 13:27.690]  maybe sometimes like Hashchurch.
[13:28.570 --> 13:31.850]  Um, yeah, I mean, those are some cool old school podcasts
[13:32.410 --> 13:34.890]  that, you know, definitely spread a lot of information.
[13:36.090 --> 13:40.090]  Um, the talagany, talagany is a strange name.
[13:40.090 --> 13:42.090]  It was labeled landry's.
[13:42.090 --> 13:44.010]  Talagany seems to be a cheese.
[13:44.010 --> 13:45.930]  Oh, interesting.
[13:46.490 --> 13:47.210]  Interesting.
[13:47.210 --> 13:48.170]  Cheeses are awesome.
[13:49.050 --> 13:50.570]  I used to grow cheese back in the day.
[13:50.570 --> 13:51.770]  Excuse me for looking on my phone.
[13:51.770 --> 13:56.970]  I'm just trying to make sure that our, our guest is able to get on.
[13:57.850 --> 14:00.890]  Um, but yeah, I used to grow cheese all the time back in the day.
[14:00.890 --> 14:03.370]  It actually did extremely well outdoors.
[14:04.250 --> 14:24.000]  Um, and by descent, um, yeah, cheese is a really good one that does great outdoors.
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.960]  Um, my only critique of cheese was that it would almost be too branchy
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.960]  and you would get a lot of little, little buds.
[14:32.960 --> 14:36.880]  And I don't know if you didn't prune it very, very well,
[14:36.880 --> 14:40.240]  you'd get tons and tons of like larf, which, which was a hassle.
[14:41.120 --> 14:43.680]  Uh, I got fat leaf plant.
[14:45.600 --> 14:46.640]  Fat leaf plant.
[14:46.640 --> 14:47.360]  Huh?
[14:47.360 --> 14:47.600]  Yeah.
[14:47.600 --> 14:53.440]  I mean, also like, um, the cheese that I was working with had fairly thin leaves.
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.600]  Um, but you know, like a lot of plants when they go into,
[14:57.600 --> 15:00.160]  when they start vegging, they have thicker leaves.
[15:00.160 --> 15:03.360]  And then when they go into flower, they get thinner leaves.
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.960]  Um, for example, like the Hanalei that I've been working, um, with, you know, with grasshopper.
[15:08.960 --> 15:16.800]  Um, when you go into veg, it, um, it looks like a, like a pretty similar,
[15:16.800 --> 15:22.640]  like a pretty common hybrid, like the, uh, the guest is going to be landrace warden.
[15:22.640 --> 15:25.040]  Like, excuse me, landrace bureau is coming in.
[15:25.040 --> 15:31.840]  Um, what was interesting about the cheese was, um, or excuse me, with Hanalei is when it vegges,
[15:31.840 --> 15:33.200]  the leaves are fairly fat.
[15:33.200 --> 15:39.760]  Like it's, it looks like a common hybrid, like I was saying, then once it goes into flower,
[15:39.760 --> 15:41.680]  then the leaves start getting thinner.
[15:41.680 --> 15:49.440]  Also, when you take a cutting of the law of plants, once the, the cologne roots, those leaves
[15:50.720 --> 15:52.480]  are also thinner than from seed.
[15:53.840 --> 15:54.400]  Go figure.
[15:54.960 --> 16:01.040]  Um, just something, you know, that I've noticed also, you know, this year,
[16:02.080 --> 16:04.400]  I grew most of my plans from cologne.
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.160]  I did not grow many from seed.
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.840]  And I mean, I guess that might be a little counterintuitive.
[16:09.840 --> 16:14.400]  A lot of people, you know, really like growing plants from seed outdoors.
[16:14.400 --> 16:19.600]  Um, but this year I figured if I grow a plant from a clone, it's going to get,
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.280]  it's going to cut down like a week of flowering or flower sooner.
[16:24.080 --> 16:29.520]  It'll cut down on the stretching and it actually should push a little bit more of that flowering
[16:29.520 --> 16:31.200]  hormone into the plant.
[16:31.280 --> 16:36.320]  Um, and you know, I've, I've been pretty pleased with, with what I, with, you know,
[16:36.320 --> 16:37.120]  how it's come out.
[16:37.120 --> 16:41.040]  Also, I'll do a spring hunt with, from seed.
[16:41.040 --> 16:47.040]  So very often what I'll do is I'll already, um, I'll grow plants out in the springtime
[16:47.040 --> 16:51.200]  and then through my spring pheno hunt, I'll then pick which plants I'm going to choose
[16:51.200 --> 16:54.880]  to run the whole, you know, a whole full season outdoor.
[16:55.440 --> 17:00.400]  Um, and you know, like people might say, like, you know, if you grow from seed, you can definitely
[17:00.480 --> 17:07.520]  get a, you know, you can put your plants in a week earlier, um, excuse me, a month earlier
[17:07.520 --> 17:11.920]  because you know, they're not as, um, eager to flower.
[17:12.800 --> 17:21.280]  And that is true, but you can also, you know, do some, um, some, um, lantern tech, you know,
[17:21.280 --> 17:24.400]  where you just put a light out on your plants a little bit early.
[17:24.400 --> 17:31.200]  So what I like to do is I'll put, um, a light out on my plants two or three hours in the
[17:31.200 --> 17:36.560]  morning, two or three hours in the evening, just to extend that photo period, the plants
[17:36.560 --> 17:37.840]  stay in veg.
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.120]  And that's the way that I'll have my plants usually starting to veg in, let's say May
[17:43.120 --> 17:44.000]  from clone.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.560]  When very often, if you put your plants out in May from clone without any extra light,
[17:48.560 --> 17:49.600]  they'll go into flower.
[17:50.160 --> 17:56.960]  Um, so, you know, if you just use a little extra light, you can run your clones and get
[17:56.960 --> 18:01.920]  them to be maybe not just as big as your seeds, but for me, I'm able to get them to be big
[18:01.920 --> 18:03.280]  enough that I need.
[18:03.280 --> 18:05.360]  Um, yeah.
[18:06.720 --> 18:10.640]  So this is the first year I grew from seed instead of clone.
[18:10.640 --> 18:16.240]  Brian, I'm curious, uh, did you like growing from seed over clone?
[18:16.240 --> 18:19.120]  Did you see any difference in the bud quality?
[18:19.120 --> 18:21.520]  I definitely see difference in the bud structure.
[18:22.560 --> 18:29.280]  Um, and honestly, I like the bud structure better on clones and on seeds.
[18:29.280 --> 18:37.040]  I feel like on, yes, um, I feel like when it's a bud structure on a seed plant, often
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.920]  it's, how do you explain it?
[18:39.920 --> 18:46.320]  There's like the thicker stem in the middle and it's often like a piece of a bud on either
[18:46.320 --> 18:54.240]  side of the stem instead of it, um, instead of it kind of like eating away at eating away
[18:54.240 --> 18:54.720]  at the stem.
[18:54.720 --> 18:58.640]  And it's just like literally one bud plants are definitely more robust from seed.
[18:58.640 --> 19:01.280]  How is the, how is the like bud structure, Brian?
[19:01.280 --> 19:02.960]  That's what I'm really curious about.
[19:02.960 --> 19:10.400]  Like, like definitely the buds seem to be bigger and rounder, but I feel like sometimes
[19:10.480 --> 19:19.120]  they're not as defined and some of the, um, maybe the characteristics or the traits,
[19:19.920 --> 19:23.920]  I feel like sometimes I don't see as much on the seeded plants.
[19:24.880 --> 19:31.520]  Um, um, Indiva, I'm not familiar with S, B, and Vs.
[19:32.480 --> 19:37.120]  Um, yeah, I have no idea what that is, but I know you have tons of informational.
[19:37.280 --> 19:39.120]  Grateful grower, good also.
[19:40.720 --> 19:41.040]  Yeah.
[19:41.040 --> 19:47.280]  The strength of seed grow outshines cuttings for yield.
[19:47.920 --> 19:49.760]  You know, I would agree for yield.
[19:49.760 --> 19:57.840]  Um, that's true, but I'm, I'm a little up in the air as far as for quality.
[19:59.040 --> 20:05.200]  Um, I'm still, I'm still not sure if this, you know, if the seed plant is, I'm not sure
[20:05.200 --> 20:09.040]  as far as for quality, I'm still a little up in the air, you know, and as far as like
[20:09.120 --> 20:14.560]  for me, like I'm able to get my plants personally to get to be as big as I need them to be.
[20:15.520 --> 20:22.000]  Um, I think my plants this year were maybe seven feet tall, seven or eight feet tall
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.280]  were the biggest ones.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.360]  Um, and they were definitely at least five or six feet wide.
[20:27.360 --> 20:28.880]  And for me that that's plenty.
[20:29.440 --> 20:35.680]  Um, so boys down to the skill of the grower for seed runs, I get better terpenes profiles
[20:35.680 --> 20:36.480]  from seed.
[20:36.480 --> 20:37.440]  Oh, interesting.
[20:37.440 --> 20:38.000]  Okay.
[20:38.080 --> 20:39.760]  Um, the setback.
[20:39.760 --> 20:40.240]  Yeah.
[20:40.240 --> 20:40.800]  See grow.
[20:41.680 --> 20:42.240]  What is this?
[20:45.040 --> 20:47.600]  Um, seed grow is consistency.
[20:50.080 --> 20:50.560]  Hmm.
[20:50.560 --> 20:51.040]  Okay.
[20:51.040 --> 20:51.600]  Yeah.
[20:51.600 --> 20:55.600]  I mean, you know, like I'll definitely go back and forth.
[20:55.600 --> 20:59.760]  I'm not experienced enough to comment on, but structure grew the biggest tallest.
[21:02.320 --> 21:02.800]  Oh yeah.
[21:02.800 --> 21:03.360]  Blueberry muffins.
[21:03.360 --> 21:05.760]  I'm, I'm know for sure about blueberry muffins.
[21:05.920 --> 21:09.520]  I'm very curious to see what, what you think about the blueberry muffins.
[21:09.520 --> 21:14.400]  So here's my deal with my thing with blueberry muffins, blueberry muffins looks amazing.
[21:14.400 --> 21:15.680]  It smells amazing.
[21:16.480 --> 21:25.280]  Um, I felt like personally, there was something about it that I didn't go back to it.
[21:25.280 --> 21:32.240]  Um, you know, that could definitely be my own personal chemistry with, with that variety,
[21:32.400 --> 21:35.040]  but I was super juiced on it.
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.080]  I've, I've grown it.
[21:36.640 --> 21:41.520]  It looked great, but for some reason it was just not something that I went back to.
[21:41.520 --> 21:46.480]  Um, and you know, I mean, everybody, everybody's on to different things.
[21:47.680 --> 21:52.960]  Um, for me, you know, that's just, that's a very big thing is what, um, what you go
[21:52.960 --> 21:53.680]  back to.
[21:53.680 --> 21:55.280]  Um, let's see what else people are saying.
[21:55.280 --> 21:56.560]  A lot of clones.
[21:57.440 --> 21:58.000]  Yeah.
[21:59.120 --> 21:59.680]  The seed.
[21:59.680 --> 22:00.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[22:00.480 --> 22:03.600]  I mean, it's like, I really like to select things before I'm really committing to a whole
[22:03.600 --> 22:04.320]  year of it.
[22:05.200 --> 22:08.880]  Um, that's, you know, one of the main reasons I like to go from seed.
[22:08.880 --> 22:09.520]  Heart of gear.
[22:09.520 --> 22:16.160]  I guess that the, not the, yeah, I didn't get to see what you're saying about heart
[22:16.160 --> 22:18.480]  of gear is moving in the thing real quick.
[22:19.040 --> 22:20.000]  Taste missing.
[22:21.040 --> 22:23.040]  This is missing or aftertaste.
[22:23.040 --> 22:24.480]  That's a lot of blueberries.
[22:24.480 --> 22:25.280]  All this look great.
[22:25.280 --> 22:25.600]  Yeah.
[22:25.600 --> 22:25.920]  Yeah.
[22:25.920 --> 22:26.960]  So, I mean, it was like,
[22:27.200 --> 22:32.720]  when I would smoke the blueberry muffins, I just felt like, like the taste was there
[22:32.720 --> 22:34.480]  for a little bit and it was all right.
[22:34.480 --> 22:36.400]  But I felt like, what was it about the high?
[22:36.400 --> 22:38.880]  I just felt like the high wasn't that exciting to me.
[22:38.880 --> 22:41.280]  It didn't get me where I wanted to go.
[22:41.280 --> 22:45.920]  I felt like it didn't really take me anywhere or didn't really take me anywhere special.
[22:45.920 --> 22:50.960]  Um, and that could totally be the Fino that we had or what, you know, whatever.
[22:51.600 --> 22:53.360]  It just didn't do that for me.
[22:53.520 --> 22:57.520]  I mean, on the other hand, if I've smoking like DJ Schwartz blueberry,
[22:57.520 --> 22:58.960]  which is a completely different plant.
[22:58.960 --> 23:03.440]  Um, that one took me to a really nice place.
[23:03.440 --> 23:06.560]  Or for example, Matt riots, blue bonnet.
[23:06.560 --> 23:08.160]  I've grown hybrids of that.
[23:08.160 --> 23:10.400]  Those also took me to a really nice place.
[23:10.400 --> 23:15.440]  Um, but they're completely different structure, completely different smell.
[23:15.440 --> 23:17.120]  They're just not the same plant.
[23:17.120 --> 23:19.120]  Like I said, I'm not a fan of the Fino.
[23:19.120 --> 23:20.400]  I'm not a fan of the Fino.
[23:20.400 --> 23:24.960]  Um, but they're completely different structure, completely different smell.
[23:25.600 --> 23:27.200]  They're just not the same plant.
[23:27.200 --> 23:32.480]  Like I would describe the blueberry from DJ short and blueberry blue bonnet is like
[23:33.120 --> 23:34.400]  chocolate blueberries.
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.680]  Like it has this heavy chocolate tie influence in it.
[23:37.680 --> 23:42.480]  And the plans have this like tie type of structure to it.
[23:42.480 --> 23:46.320]  Like the structure to like the real blueberry is not the greatest.
[23:46.320 --> 23:47.920]  The vigor is not the greatest.
[23:48.080 --> 23:51.360]  Like tie thing that's not super vigorous.
[23:51.920 --> 23:58.000]  Um, the blueberry muffins is more of like an Indica hybrid type of thing that,
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.200]  you know, humble seed company made.
[24:01.680 --> 24:04.400]  Um, so yeah, it's just like a different plant.
[24:04.960 --> 24:07.040]  Um, yeah.
[24:07.040 --> 24:09.760]  And, um, yeah.
[24:11.280 --> 24:17.850]  Um, Missouri, sure.
[24:17.850 --> 24:19.210]  If the Fino hunts are fun.
[24:19.610 --> 24:21.130]  Um, yeah.
[24:21.130 --> 24:24.090]  So, you know, let me go into something else with you guys.
[24:24.090 --> 24:27.050]  Or just chatting, waiting for our guests to come on.
[24:27.050 --> 24:31.850]  Um, so yeah, yesterday I was smoking and I was like, hmm, it's like there are some effects
[24:31.850 --> 24:34.090]  that I like and there's some effects that I don't really like.
[24:34.890 --> 24:42.890]  Um, and so, you know, in the chats, I'll ask you guys and all, you know, we'll talk about
[24:42.890 --> 24:43.050]  it.
[24:43.050 --> 24:46.890]  Um, first I wanted to go to the three effects that I really like.
[24:46.890 --> 24:48.410]  And I'm really curious for you guys.
[24:49.690 --> 24:54.010]  It's those cut, cut, cut genetics that get, that get genetically weak.
[24:54.010 --> 25:02.490]  Um, I would argue against that, you know, whether there's genetic drift from cuttings.
[25:03.050 --> 25:05.930]  Um, but I don't want to, I don't want to touch on that just yet.
[25:06.890 --> 25:09.930]  Let's go into three favorite effects.
[25:10.730 --> 25:17.530]  Um, so for me, the three most favorite effects is one, this sounds really silly.
[25:17.530 --> 25:19.530]  I love weed that makes me want to rap.
[25:19.530 --> 25:20.970]  And that makes me want to freestyle.
[25:20.970 --> 25:26.730]  And that just gets my thoughts flowing forward and moving out of my brain and just going,
[25:26.730 --> 25:27.930]  going, going.
[25:27.930 --> 25:33.930]  And when you listen to music, you just want to just vibe to it and just start freestyling.
[25:33.930 --> 25:37.770]  For me, that is the number one quality of weed.
[25:37.770 --> 25:40.650]  And I'll sit in the car and I'll try to freestyle.
[25:40.650 --> 25:44.730]  And even if I can't do it and it sounds terrible, I'll just keep going.
[25:45.610 --> 25:47.050]  That is the best kind of weed.
[25:47.130 --> 25:53.130]  I would say Lamb's Breath is a really good one that used to have that from this killer
[25:53.130 --> 25:54.570]  medical dispensary in Berkeley.
[25:54.570 --> 25:58.090]  They always had the same Lamb's Breath or Lamb's Bread.
[25:59.050 --> 26:02.010]  Anybody else, you know, knows about this place in Berkeley.
[26:02.010 --> 26:04.810]  It was on Telegraph Ave in Berkeley, killer dispensary.
[26:05.530 --> 26:11.130]  Sour Diesel has that similar type of like get going and thinking and moving forward.
[26:11.770 --> 26:14.570]  Flow has that, Blueberry has that.
[26:15.210 --> 26:20.490]  Um, I really like weed that you can smoke in the morning and that you can smoke at night.
[26:20.490 --> 26:22.890]  I like weed that you can smoke all the time.
[26:22.890 --> 26:27.690]  I like stuff that if I smoke weed and then I go to bed right away, I don't have high
[26:27.690 --> 26:34.010]  dreams and I'm not all groggy and kind of like really sleepy and tired.
[26:34.010 --> 26:34.970]  I don't like that.
[26:34.970 --> 26:39.610]  So like last night I smoked a bag of Sour Diesel and then 10 minutes later, 20 minutes
[26:39.610 --> 26:40.650]  later, fell asleep.
[26:40.890 --> 26:43.290]  If you guys can see, I have a fair amount of energy now.
[26:43.290 --> 26:46.330]  Like I'm talking, you know, I don't drink coffee or anything.
[26:46.330 --> 26:47.770]  I haven't smoked anything this morning.
[26:47.770 --> 26:49.290]  So like I really like that.
[26:49.290 --> 26:52.570]  I like weed that, you know, if I just, it's like, what do you call it?
[26:52.570 --> 26:53.770]  Like desert island weed.
[26:53.770 --> 26:57.850]  If it's just one strain, you can just, let's hear you flow.
[27:04.010 --> 27:06.010]  Oh man, Nick, you're a funny guy.
[27:06.010 --> 27:09.770]  I feel a little on the spot to be able to flow right now.
[27:11.050 --> 27:13.610]  Yeah, GMO Blue Bonnet from Riot.
[27:13.610 --> 27:14.110]  Yeah.
[27:14.890 --> 27:15.930]  That sounds like a killer.
[27:16.490 --> 27:18.330]  You know, I did the, what was it?
[27:18.330 --> 27:24.730]  The Durban OG by Blue Bonnet and I found some really great Blue Bonnet Dinos and made some
[27:24.730 --> 27:26.170]  hybrids with it.
[27:26.170 --> 27:28.090]  They were all Blue Bonnet leaning.
[27:30.330 --> 27:31.130]  I really liked it.
[27:31.130 --> 27:31.290]  Yeah.
[27:31.290 --> 27:33.290]  I made like my own take on like Blue Dream.
[27:33.290 --> 27:34.010]  That was awesome.
[27:35.690 --> 27:39.130]  So yeah, you know, looking in here, oh, somebody's saying the Slimer.
[27:39.130 --> 27:40.570]  So was that your Chernobyl cut?
[27:40.570 --> 27:42.250]  That's some interesting stuff.
[27:44.010 --> 27:49.850]  You know, I'm really interested in, you know, the different characteristics that you like.
[27:49.850 --> 27:52.810]  And, you know, it's very, it's different from person to person.
[27:52.810 --> 27:58.090]  Like, for example, for me, I like to have a little bit of weed that helps with stomach pain.
[28:01.450 --> 28:01.950]  Not enough.
[28:02.890 --> 28:04.650]  Yeah, no, the volcano is right here, man.
[28:04.650 --> 28:06.410]  It's just on the side.
[28:06.410 --> 28:08.650]  I really like to have weed that works great for stomach pain.
[28:08.730 --> 28:13.370]  I've noticed that like the AFGUI, if you guys have ever tried that one or GUI, a lot of
[28:13.370 --> 28:21.610]  those seem to have some nice like stomach qualities.
[28:21.610 --> 28:24.250]  Also, like if you can't sleep, those ones really help.
[28:24.810 --> 28:32.010]  But like for me, FCP, Freestyle Fetlish, for me, I don't like smoking those often.
[28:32.010 --> 28:36.330]  So like I might have like an ounce of something that's super sleepy.
[28:36.330 --> 28:41.370]  You know, if you have stomach pain, if you just cannot sleep, that's the weed that you go to.
[28:42.010 --> 28:44.090]  But in general, I don't like smoking that.
[28:44.090 --> 28:48.170]  So for example, she's this must have been almost 20 years ago.
[28:48.170 --> 28:49.850]  We were going medically and we grew.
[28:50.810 --> 28:51.210]  I don't know.
[28:51.210 --> 28:52.970]  We had a whole house full of AFGUI.
[28:52.970 --> 28:54.010]  That's all that we had.
[28:54.650 --> 28:58.410]  So we would smoke AFGUI in the morning, smoke AFGUI at night.
[28:59.290 --> 29:01.450]  That's all we would smoke was AFGUI.
[29:01.450 --> 29:05.690]  And it was completely torturous because, yeah, the first time you smoke it,
[29:05.690 --> 29:06.330]  it's awesome.
[29:07.130 --> 29:08.650]  And then you're tired and you're hungry.
[29:08.650 --> 29:13.050]  And then the rest of the day, you're just dragging and you just cannot get anything done.
[29:13.050 --> 29:15.050]  And you have no other weed to smoke.
[29:15.050 --> 29:18.410]  And, you know, being back then, it was like you monocropped, you know what I mean?
[29:18.410 --> 29:21.130]  Like you did all of your rooms or your room of one thing.
[29:21.690 --> 29:23.210]  And that's just what you ran.
[29:23.770 --> 29:27.770]  And so like something like at that time, having something like AFGUI sucked
[29:28.330 --> 29:32.810]  because it was too potent and you just couldn't get anything done.
[29:33.290 --> 29:38.010]  I'm having an ounce of AFGUI to have whenever you need it around.
[29:38.010 --> 29:38.570]  It's killer.
[29:39.770 --> 29:42.570]  Slime buckets saying, yeah, Mom GUI is still around.
[29:42.570 --> 29:45.050]  I've done a seed increase with Mom GUI.
[29:46.330 --> 29:48.490]  Did some GUI.
[29:49.610 --> 29:51.130]  I found a pineapple FINO.
[29:52.730 --> 29:54.010]  It's really good herb.
[29:54.010 --> 30:00.570]  It's really it's like an old school variety, but it's good, different herb.
[30:00.570 --> 30:05.370]  And one of the cool things that GUI breeders talked about is that you can harvest it at
[30:05.370 --> 30:08.010]  different times to get different effects.
[30:08.570 --> 30:10.410]  And I think that that's super, super cool.
[30:10.970 --> 30:16.090]  So like with the GUI, you would harvest it super early to get your daytime effects.
[30:16.090 --> 30:22.170]  And then you would let it go long, long, long time to really get those indica effects.
[30:24.650 --> 30:28.250]  So, yeah, that's that's super awesome.
[30:30.890 --> 30:35.690]  Here, let me send this guy invite again, and then we're going to go into
[30:36.730 --> 30:39.770]  the things that we are our least favorite.
[31:09.640 --> 31:10.120]  All right.
[31:12.040 --> 31:14.520]  Just flipped a sour diesel by Runts OG.
[31:15.880 --> 31:19.480]  Blueberry headband, white runts, stem rub producing blueberry.
[31:19.480 --> 31:20.040]  Interesting.
[31:21.800 --> 31:24.440]  I like early pull sativas for racy hype.
[31:24.440 --> 31:25.080]  Yeah, me too.
[31:26.040 --> 31:29.320]  I also like pulling stuff for the racy high.
[31:30.120 --> 31:35.800]  Honestly, I kind of like when the weather is so nice, it's hard for me to really
[31:37.560 --> 31:38.360]  pull stuff.
[31:38.360 --> 31:41.400]  You know, it's like I just see getting bigger and I think it's getting better.
[31:41.400 --> 31:44.280]  But a lot of times it's nicer to pull it early.
[31:44.280 --> 31:48.200]  You know, you get a chance to really see what you actually like smoking,
[31:48.200 --> 31:50.440]  what the chemistry in your body really likes.
[31:50.440 --> 31:54.040]  Hard to believe, but there's still the old Mexican pressed around.
[31:55.080 --> 31:56.040]  Old headache weed.
[31:58.120 --> 31:59.880]  So, yeah, here's my question now.
[31:59.880 --> 32:02.600]  What are the three traits that you guys do not like in weed?
[32:03.240 --> 32:05.240]  That's I'm really, really curious about.
[32:05.240 --> 32:10.120]  So I'll tell you the first trait that I do not like in weed.
[32:10.120 --> 32:15.160]  And maybe this is me blaming weed for my own problems, but I do not like weed.
[32:15.160 --> 32:20.760]  That makes me forget that is by far the worst quality in weed.
[32:20.760 --> 32:22.680]  The stuff that makes you forget.
[32:22.680 --> 32:25.880]  My homie had a strain, he called it eraser head.
[32:26.840 --> 32:31.640]  And he said it's like you would do something and then forget what you last just did.
[32:34.040 --> 32:35.560]  I don't like that kind of weed.
[32:36.440 --> 32:40.840]  It's I already have enough problems remembering the different things I need to do.
[32:41.880 --> 32:48.680]  And, you know, stuff that causes me to forget what I was just doing is not a good trait for weed.
[32:49.480 --> 32:51.880]  Another weed that I really don't like, huh?
[32:51.880 --> 32:53.560]  Yeah, stuff that gives you anxiety.
[32:53.560 --> 32:58.440]  So it's funny, like for me, those weed I've smoked some weed that gave me a lot of anxiety,
[32:58.440 --> 33:00.840]  like the black triangle from Bodie.
[33:01.400 --> 33:03.800]  Very, very potent used to give me anxiety.
[33:03.800 --> 33:08.200]  Even I would smoke the same weed multiple times a day was still giving me anxiety.
[33:08.200 --> 33:10.920]  Funny enough, I would be able to laugh at myself and be like,
[33:10.920 --> 33:13.240]  you know, I'm just getting anxiety from this weed.
[33:13.240 --> 33:14.040]  This is silly.
[33:14.680 --> 33:18.680]  So personally, that's not where my anxiety would really come from.
[33:18.680 --> 33:20.520]  But I can completely see Green Ghost.
[33:21.160 --> 33:23.640]  If you have anxiety issues, and weed gives you anxiety, I mean,
[33:23.640 --> 33:25.800]  that would just not be a fun thing, period.
[33:25.800 --> 33:29.080]  It's just not, you know, you want your weed to do the opposite.
[33:29.080 --> 33:32.200]  What I found is a lot of times it comes in with the dose.
[33:32.200 --> 33:35.960]  And that if you smoke a little bit, it has a certain effect.
[33:35.960 --> 33:38.280]  And then when you smoke a lot, it has a different effect.
[33:38.280 --> 33:42.360]  And that often, you know, can make people paranoid.
[33:42.360 --> 33:46.120]  For me, when I'm paranoid, I'm just kind of like laughing and like, haha, like,
[33:46.840 --> 33:49.640]  you know, I kind of don't take myself seriously.
[33:51.080 --> 33:58.680]  The second kind of weed that I don't really like is stuff that makes me sleepy.
[34:00.280 --> 34:02.520]  Or what I call it's like the whole cycle.
[34:02.520 --> 34:06.440]  So weed that will make you really hungry, really sleepy,
[34:07.240 --> 34:12.040]  really give you kind of a headache, and then like the whole thing goes away.
[34:14.120 --> 34:16.360]  I don't like that kind of weed.
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.080]  I feel like it gets you to blame your problems.
[34:21.080 --> 34:23.080]  Yeah, seems like more of a negative trait.
[34:23.080 --> 34:23.800]  Like, yeah.
[34:26.040 --> 34:30.280]  And, you know, it's like, you know, it's like all of these things, you know,
[34:31.400 --> 34:33.160]  work in conjunction with each other.
[34:33.160 --> 34:34.760]  You know, it's like you're having a bad day,
[34:34.760 --> 34:36.360]  and you smoke a certain kind of weed.
[34:36.360 --> 34:37.400]  And you know what I mean?
[34:37.400 --> 34:39.880]  It's like they all just kind of contribute to each other.
[34:41.480 --> 34:45.080]  But yeah, you know, like, I definitely don't like stuff that makes me sleepy.
[34:45.080 --> 34:48.200]  And that, you know, like makes you really hungry and kind of like,
[34:48.200 --> 34:51.960]  just want to eat and, and then like, kind of goes away really quickly.
[34:51.960 --> 34:55.880]  And I felt like, for a while, Blue Dream would really do that,
[34:55.880 --> 34:57.800]  where it would really come in super strong.
[34:58.440 --> 35:02.920]  And it would just kind of come in strong and then leave,
[35:02.920 --> 35:06.520]  and didn't really like stay and let you like party in a nice place.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.600]  So yeah, anything lethargic from the onset?
[35:12.600 --> 35:13.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:13.640 --> 35:16.680]  Lethargic stuff, I didn't particularly like,
[35:16.680 --> 35:19.560]  I felt like often when stuff would go a little bit too long,
[35:19.560 --> 35:24.840]  when you would let, you know, cut it a little bit late, it got a little lethargic.
[35:28.680 --> 35:31.080]  Yeah, you know, those are not my favorites.
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.480]  And, you know, those aren't my favorites.
[35:37.480 --> 35:39.480]  You know, that's kind of really what it comes down to.
[35:40.360 --> 35:47.720]  Also, I have why I think is important, and something really worth observing is,
[35:49.960 --> 35:54.120]  is which ones that you come back to, you know, I think that's important.
[35:55.400 --> 36:01.080]  Which ones you smoke at first, like, to me, that's really what tells me what I like the most
[36:01.080 --> 36:04.680]  is I'll look at the jars and be like, Oh, this one went the fastest,
[36:04.680 --> 36:08.200]  or I keep coming back to this strain all the time.
[36:10.440 --> 36:12.520]  You know, that's something I should grow next year.
[36:14.440 --> 36:19.960]  You know, that is super, super important that you smoke something that with your particular body
[36:19.960 --> 36:25.880]  chemistry, that it, you know, that it resonates with Yeah, this person is talking about salads.
[36:27.400 --> 36:30.760]  You know, salads are nice. I like mixing a bunch of things together. I found that when
[36:30.760 --> 36:35.720]  you make salads, you definitely get high, but you also seems like you get your tolerance goes
[36:35.720 --> 36:42.200]  up a little bit higher, and you definitely get hungry. So, you know, for me, like some people,
[36:42.200 --> 36:48.040]  they need to put on weight. I don't have that issue. So, you know, for me smoking stuff that
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.800]  makes me hungry is not always the best. I mean, it's weird. Like, I always seem just to go back
[36:53.800 --> 37:02.840]  to smoking a lot of sour, smoking a lot of pure kush, I'm smoking diesel. You know, and it's like,
[37:02.840 --> 37:07.160]  I don't know a lot of people like I'm only about the gas. I only smoke gas. And for the longest
[37:07.160 --> 37:11.640]  time, I thought that was really silly. I just didn't really get it. But now I'm like, I kind
[37:11.640 --> 37:18.520]  of get it. Like those are the ones that, you know, that get you where you want to be consistently.
[37:18.520 --> 37:24.760]  And, you know, that's awesome. What is it? What is what is Nick saying? I hate the weed that is
[37:25.560 --> 37:28.680]  too good. It doesn't replenish yourself every time you open the jar.
[37:29.240 --> 37:36.040]  I mean, everlasting jar of weed would be nice. This is kind of an everlasting jar of weed. I
[37:36.040 --> 37:43.240]  mean, it's so here this is some lemon Royale that my homie in SoCal grew.
[37:45.640 --> 37:52.840]  Yeah, it's really it's pretty good. I mean, it has like this like, fairly like commercial look to it.
[37:53.800 --> 38:00.490]  Yeah, yeah, big up Justin. I assume you're probably not watching. But yeah, I mean,
[38:00.490 --> 38:07.690]  this is some lemon Royale came out really nice. Yeah, I'm curious with you guys. What are what
[38:07.690 --> 38:14.650]  are some things that you don't like in in, you know, the qualities of the stuff that you're
[38:14.650 --> 38:20.970]  smoking? Towards trainwreck and skunk? You know, it's funny, I grew some time around
[38:21.130 --> 38:27.210]  from subcool last year. And I was super, super juiced. You know, subcool is not around. And,
[38:27.770 --> 38:31.930]  you know, I always remember it being really good. You know, his stuff being good.
[38:33.130 --> 38:38.810]  The plants came out great. It looked really frosty. But I'll be honest, I didn't smoke it.
[38:38.810 --> 38:46.730]  You know, it ended up going bad. The rosin I made from it, I still have. It just didn't have,
[38:46.730 --> 38:52.250]  I don't know, it just didn't have the staying power that I was looking for. A lot of hype
[38:52.250 --> 38:57.130]  streams come on quick and yeah, and leave quickly. Yeah, I mean, a lot of the like cookies stuff will
[38:57.130 --> 39:04.170]  come on will come on really strong. What I've noticed is, I mean, the Girl Scout cookies doesn't
[39:04.170 --> 39:10.730]  seem to leave quickly, it just seems to be extremely potent. And I mean, you know, if you get
[39:11.370 --> 39:15.850]  it from the right people, it just puts you on your butt.
[39:17.770 --> 39:21.930]  Green Ghost, have I grown anything from Jinx Proof? Yes, I have grown stuff from Jinx Proof. I
[39:21.930 --> 39:30.650]  grew electric water. What is it? Was it electric watermelon OG? Mother's Tongue. I grew Mother's
[39:30.650 --> 39:38.970]  Tongue. I really, really liked it. Actually, I really liked it. It was good. It felt like a
[39:38.970 --> 39:46.890]  grown man's OG. It really hit in the right area. It was potent. It had staying power. We kept that
[39:46.890 --> 39:54.970]  clone for three or four years, we would run it. I was living in Seattle at the time. So I got a
[39:54.970 --> 40:00.570]  chance to go to Jinx Proof's pipe shop and meet him. And he was there with his kid and his wife.
[40:01.450 --> 40:10.650]  Super nice guy. I mean, he was just a really friendly person. Yeah, you know, I work with
[40:10.650 --> 40:16.810]  people like that. Like I support people like that. Like it was it was cool. You know, he treated me
[40:16.810 --> 40:23.290]  nicely. I bought a pipe from him in his store. I got some seeds from him. And they did well. So
[40:23.930 --> 40:28.170]  yeah, I have I've worked with his stuff. And you know, he's he is a he's a good dude.
[40:29.850 --> 40:35.290]  Cookies hybrids tastes like fish food. I mean, I haven't experienced that. But for me cookies,
[40:35.290 --> 40:38.250]  I don't know, like when I first smelled cookies, I did not think it smelled good. I thought it
[40:38.250 --> 40:43.290]  tasted like a sulfur burner. Actually, interestingly, the first time that I had cookies,
[40:43.290 --> 40:48.730]  I thought that somebody had used a sulfur burner for too long in the room. I had this like sulfur-y
[40:48.730 --> 40:54.890]  type of smell to it that I just was not used to. It was not a sulfur burner. That's just how
[40:54.890 --> 41:00.890]  cookie smells. It has that that really interesting thing going on to it. Every time I smoke something
[41:00.890 --> 41:07.050]  new. But that third time. Yeah, and that's another really interesting thing. It's like you smoke
[41:07.050 --> 41:12.010]  something the first time you smoke it. It's like, you know, your it's just like unlocks these
[41:12.010 --> 41:17.050]  different parts of your brain. You're like, Whoa, this is really interesting. And then you smoke it
[41:17.050 --> 41:21.930]  again. And you're like, what the hell? It's, it's like, you already have the tolerance to it. So
[41:21.930 --> 41:28.010]  that's something that I would say, well, add that to the list. I don't like weed that it, you know,
[41:28.010 --> 41:33.050]  your body gets a tolerance to it very, very easily, which I find indica is your body gets a
[41:33.050 --> 41:38.330]  tolerance to fairly easy. On the flip side, I love smoking stuff. Every time you smoke it,
[41:38.330 --> 41:43.210]  it's like you're smoking it for the first time. That's really, really awesome trait for weed.
[41:43.850 --> 41:50.250]  Honestly, I find that trait in OGs and sour. That's really a place that you know, you're able
[41:50.250 --> 41:56.890]  to smoke the same thing and every time they get you to that place. That is awesome. Blueberry
[41:56.890 --> 42:03.210]  champagne. I've never I've smoked some champagne. I live in British Columbia. That stuff was awesome.
[42:03.210 --> 42:09.290]  I've never smoked the blueberry champagne. What is this person pierced to Tiva gold,
[42:09.290 --> 42:19.770]  New Guinea gold above Australia, not much talked about. Interesting. I've not heard of much weed
[42:19.770 --> 42:27.290]  from New Guinea at all. That's true Damien. Yeah, I can't really touch on stuff from that area at
[42:27.290 --> 42:43.370]  all. Definitely, you know, let's talk about it. Blue dot train wreck. Interesting. Blue dots.
[42:43.370 --> 42:47.530]  Awesome. That sounds like some old school stuff. Blue dot train wreck. Definitely. I would say
[42:47.530 --> 43:00.010]  that's some old school stuff. So Mr. Nice sells packs. Yeah. I mean, Mr. Nice stuff is old school.
[43:00.890 --> 43:08.570]  Super legit. Yeah, but I'm curious from you guys, what are some traits that you do not like in
[43:08.570 --> 43:12.650]  cannabis? What are some things that you're not looking for? It seems like people don't like
[43:12.650 --> 43:17.930]  stuff that's sleepy. People don't like stuff that makes them anxious. I mean, definitely,
[43:17.930 --> 43:21.130]  if you get anxious, you probably don't want to be smoking a lot of sativas.
[43:22.570 --> 43:26.330]  Or, you know, really, you just want to smoke a little bit. You just want to smoke the right
[43:26.330 --> 43:30.970]  amount of it. I mean, a lot of us love the physical act of smoking or vaping or whatever.
[43:32.650 --> 43:34.730]  But when you get to certain amounts of these,
[43:35.930 --> 43:41.130]  certain concentrations, the effects may and will be things that you're not looking for.
[43:43.530 --> 43:50.170]  Yeah. Where is the warden? Maybe he's coming on at 10.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.880]  Yeah, we definitely do have a guest coming on. I'm not just
[44:11.400 --> 44:16.280]  fronting on you guys, but, you know, maybe he's getting his coffee, you know, getting ready.
[44:18.440 --> 44:21.240]  Only thing I don't like about some cannabis is the price.
[44:21.880 --> 44:33.000]  Yeah. That's, I mean, so chill, Bert. I would say, you know, yeah, the price sucks.
[44:33.880 --> 44:38.840]  You know, definitely, if you're buying stuff from a person and not from a corporation, at least
[44:39.480 --> 44:45.960]  you know who's getting the money. I mean, that's the thing that I would encourage is to
[44:46.520 --> 44:51.800]  work with people that you know. I mean, I appreciate it when I could purchase cannabis
[44:51.800 --> 44:57.160]  from people that I know appreciated that money and could use that money to, you know,
[44:57.160 --> 45:00.840]  keep circulating back in the community. And it's not going to go just to like some
[45:01.640 --> 45:08.520]  corporation or some LLC or whatever like that. You know, I appreciate it when I would spend my
[45:08.520 --> 45:13.480]  money and it would go to another person. I think that's something really special about the cannabis
[45:13.480 --> 45:18.040]  community. Don't like anything with Jack Terps, Trainwreck, Jack Herrera, and all crosses.
[45:20.360 --> 45:25.720]  All right. So let's get into that. You know, it's funny, like somebody asked me,
[45:26.680 --> 45:33.080]  they were like, you know, back in the day, Jack Terps didn't have the bad name that they have now.
[45:34.680 --> 45:40.520]  And I mean, there are still some genetics that have good Jack Terps. Like for example, Dutch
[45:40.600 --> 45:44.760]  Treat. You know, I used to hold the cut of Dutch Treat for a long time. And I thought that that,
[45:45.800 --> 45:49.480]  it definitely had Jack Herrera Terps, but it had good Jack Herrera Terps. It wasn't
[45:49.480 --> 45:57.000]  out of hand. It wasn't untasteful. They were good Jack Herrera Terps. And it's like,
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.680]  how do you differentiate between good Jack Terps and bad Jack Terps?
[46:03.480 --> 46:07.880]  That's a really good question. I would almost argue that for me, it's like terpinaline,
[46:07.880 --> 46:15.560]  which is that Jack Terp. Same as, you know, Terp, same as Terp, same as Trainwreck,
[46:15.560 --> 46:21.400]  you know, all of those. I would argue that terpinaline is kind of like salt,
[46:22.520 --> 46:30.280]  where it can help bring out other flavors. It is a nice thing to add to things to make it
[46:30.280 --> 46:37.640]  loud and have certain things come out and certain things pop in certain ways. But just like salt,
[46:37.960 --> 46:45.080]  just like bacon, it's easy to overdo it. And when you overdo it, what you have does not
[46:45.080 --> 46:54.600]  taste the same, does not have that same delicious effect. That's my theory. What do you guys think
[46:54.600 --> 47:00.200]  about that? Do you guys agree with that? Because, you know, it's like if you look into testing and
[47:00.200 --> 47:04.600]  you look into terpene profiles of a lot of different strains, terpinaline is in a lot of
[47:04.600 --> 47:13.880]  them. There's, you know, a lot. It's a very, very common terpene. It's just the amount and the other
[47:13.880 --> 47:22.520]  terpenes that are there with it. And, you know, it's like when you are painting, for example,
[47:22.520 --> 47:29.080]  and you're mixing colors. If you mix too much of certain colors, you'll get it with brown,
[47:29.080 --> 47:34.120]  you'll get black, you'll get these things that aren't the bright, nice colors that you're looking
[47:34.120 --> 47:39.480]  for. So like mixing things is an art in itself, which is what breeding is, right? I mean, you're
[47:39.480 --> 47:47.160]  just mixing different things together. Agsy dude said that Jack Herrera that we have access now
[47:47.160 --> 47:54.440]  is Jack Flash. Interesting. So yeah, I mean, I will tell you, I don't like black Jack. And that's
[47:54.440 --> 47:59.960]  super common in the Bay Area. I know like Harbor, Dark Heart has been putting out, it's like a Jack
[47:59.960 --> 48:06.360]  Herrera or something. It's called Black Jack. I did not like Black Jack. I've smoked a fair amount
[48:06.360 --> 48:12.520]  of Black Jack from people that grew up very well. Did not like it. I just did not think it was good.
[48:13.800 --> 48:23.560]  So, you know, there is new Jack Herrera stuff that isn't good. Yeah. Pioneers, you're over.
[48:23.560 --> 48:28.840]  Yes. I mean, Pioneers is pretty much my favorite now. AK from Serious Things,
[48:28.920 --> 48:35.560]  from Serious was overrated, could be a batch of seeds, but King Tut is best. I mean, I will say
[48:36.360 --> 48:42.200]  if anybody can get some hybrids of the Cherry AK that's been going around, it's killer. I did
[48:42.760 --> 48:53.960]  Cherry AK by Blue Bonnet. That was great. I know there's a few top breeders around that are
[48:53.960 --> 49:01.400]  circulating hybrids with Cherry AK. It was really nice one. This person, William is saying,
[49:02.680 --> 49:09.800]  you grew the Black Jack last year. Didn't love it either. Yeah. I mean, it's a great plant. Like,
[49:09.800 --> 49:16.280]  I think it grows really nice, but there's just something about the terpeneline in there. That's
[49:16.280 --> 49:24.360]  just same thing with the Time Wreck. You know, plant was beautiful, potent, great returns with
[49:24.360 --> 49:33.560]  rosin. I probably threw away like a half pound of it. You know, it just did not get smoked. Nobody.
[49:33.560 --> 49:38.600]  I agree with genetic Hermes. If you would be interested in sharing your knowledge in this
[49:38.600 --> 49:47.160]  area, I'd love to pick your bane. My results have been amazing. I mean, personally, I don't breed
[49:47.160 --> 49:59.560]  with Hermes. A lot of the best genetics have, were bred with Herm genetics, but you also have the
[49:59.560 --> 50:10.440]  possibility of continuing to breed Hermes. And for me, breeding Hermes is a very disappointing
[50:11.480 --> 50:16.680]  thing to have happen, especially because I grow a lot of outdoor. And so to have really big plants
[50:17.480 --> 50:23.720]  that, you know, three, four or five weeks in the flower, you have to cut down is just not something
[50:23.720 --> 50:30.440]  that I'm really willing to take the chance on. So in general, I just don't really pop bag seeds.
[50:30.440 --> 50:35.720]  I don't know what they are. Also where I live, I live in California. There's so many, there's so
[50:35.720 --> 50:43.400]  much genetics. I have more seeds now than I could probably ever pop in my life. So for me, I just
[50:43.400 --> 50:50.280]  don't do that. But like I said before, there are people who look through Herm genetics and find
[50:50.280 --> 50:57.320]  amazing things. Chemdog was found in Herm genetics. OG Kush was found in Herm genetics.
[50:57.880 --> 51:05.080]  Sour Diesel was found with multiple Hermes. So I'm not going to say that it's bad. It's just not
[51:05.080 --> 51:11.800]  what I do because I don't, I am afraid. I want to steer clear of Hermes. That's just something that
[51:11.800 --> 51:16.600]  I really want to steer clear of. The seeds that I make are, you know, predominantly for people
[51:16.600 --> 51:21.720]  growing outdoors. So that's just something that I stay away from. If you pop something that
[51:22.920 --> 51:29.720]  isn't a Herm and you test it and you offered it to me, I would definitely run it. So, you know,
[51:29.720 --> 51:34.040]  there's like, you know, once it's tested, it's fine. Then it's just some genetics.
[51:36.600 --> 51:43.320]  Big Bud by Sensi, Mamataya by someone else. I'm curious how the Big Bud is. I mean,
[51:43.320 --> 51:51.320]  Big Bud is definitely old school now. Like that's old genetics. I'm really curious about that one.
[51:54.120 --> 52:03.080]  Yeah. So I'm just going to start talking about Landry Spiro. And maybe as I'm talking about him,
[52:03.800 --> 52:13.080]  he will, you know, he'll show up. So the reason why, you know, so I asked Landry Spiro to come
[52:13.080 --> 52:19.240]  on and talk about genetics today. If you don't follow him, I would recommend you follow him.
[52:19.240 --> 52:25.560]  His name is Landry Spiro on Instagram. What I think makes him really unique and interesting
[52:25.560 --> 52:32.680]  is that he has a lot of Landry's genetics that are also auto flowers. That's really cool. You
[52:32.680 --> 52:40.920]  know, like auto flowers have a mixed reputation. But, you know, I think they're all different tools
[52:40.920 --> 52:45.640]  for, you know, different tools for different situations. And for me, next spring, I want to
[52:45.640 --> 52:50.920]  run auto flowers because by the springtime, my outdoor starts to get old. I want something fresh.
[52:51.640 --> 52:56.360]  So I'm going to start running auto flowers in the spring. So I have something to smoke in the summer.
[52:57.080 --> 53:06.200]  He has autos that are, I think, from like, he has Siberian autos, he has Crimean autos,
[53:06.200 --> 53:13.480]  he has Ukrainian autos. You know, a lot of stuff from like the Russian continent.
[53:16.280 --> 53:24.040]  Russia continent. Kind of embarrassing. I figured it out here, but from Russia. And,
[53:24.040 --> 53:30.040]  you know, I think that's really cool. You know, we need to jump into as much of this
[53:30.040 --> 53:38.040]  cannabis gene pool as we can to look for things that we can use. So yeah, I think that's really
[53:38.040 --> 53:45.000]  interesting that he has things from those various areas and that he's working them into modern stuff,
[53:45.000 --> 53:54.440]  working those into other landrace varieties. Also, you know, that also lends itself to them
[53:54.440 --> 54:00.600]  having some sort of vigor and some sort of durability if they're being grown in Russia.
[54:01.880 --> 54:09.720]  You know, that's a very harsh climate that's, you know, very seasonal. So I, you know, I've seen
[54:09.960 --> 54:15.640]  I've seen pictures of, you know, of landrace stuff and auto flowers or just, you know, hemp varieties
[54:15.640 --> 54:19.480]  from those areas. And I mean, they can definitely get tall enough, you know, they're not
[54:20.040 --> 54:23.640]  little tiny plants, like, you know, a couple feet tall, like they get pretty big.
[54:25.240 --> 54:30.040]  And so I think that's really cool. And that's definitely a great tool that can be used
[54:31.160 --> 54:35.400]  for us to, you know, continue to reinvigorate the gene pool.
[54:35.800 --> 54:38.280]  So yeah, you know, I'm really excited about that.
[54:42.010 --> 54:48.410]  I'm also, you know, like looking into making some autos, not particularly for first sale,
[54:48.410 --> 54:54.330]  but just to, you know, to have something to have something to consume, have something that you can,
[54:55.130 --> 54:58.250]  you know, have some some herb for in the summertime. Because I mean,
[54:58.650 --> 55:05.130]  when you get into the summer, you know, other people who are also, you know,
[55:05.130 --> 55:10.890]  predominantly outdoor people know that your stuff starts to get old. And, you know, that is probably
[55:10.890 --> 55:16.810]  one of the biggest downfalls of the outdoor growing is that, you know, you have to grow for
[55:16.810 --> 55:24.730]  the whole year and that for let's say, four or five, say, four to five years, you know,
[55:25.130 --> 55:32.170]  four or five, say, four, three to four months of the year, what you're smoking, in my opinion,
[55:33.050 --> 55:37.930]  starts to suck. It starts to get old. If you don't store it really properly,
[55:39.050 --> 55:45.050]  you're smoking old weed. And, you know, that's when the people who have indoor really start
[55:45.050 --> 55:48.410]  to kind of laugh at you for, you know, smoking on that brown outdoor.
[55:49.370 --> 55:59.050]  Come on, Landrace, come in. We're welcoming you into the scene. We're ready for you to come on.
[56:02.680 --> 56:19.280]  Yeah, we're ready for you to come on. Yeah, those go for storage conditions. I love the
[56:19.280 --> 56:26.240]  white widow. It's amazing. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, that's kind of where I'm at. Like, you know,
[56:26.800 --> 56:34.400]  in the past, autos have had a really bad reputation. Oh, here we go. Oh, is that Peter
[56:34.400 --> 56:45.520]  coming on? That's not. That's. Yeah. Yeah, Peter, I'm not sure where our guest is. He says he's I
[56:45.520 --> 56:54.000]  don't know if he's having some technical difficulties. But I was gonna say, maybe we
[56:54.000 --> 57:06.400]  can do a quick seed giveaway while we're waiting. Sure. So basically, for anybody who's on discord.
[57:08.320 --> 57:15.440]  And we will rant. Let me cue this up. Yeah, I've actually been playing with
[57:16.400 --> 57:23.890]  just growing auto flowers outside. And what do you think?
[57:27.890 --> 57:35.170]  Yeah, I mean, like, I, you know, I think everything has its place. And, you know, for
[57:35.170 --> 57:42.530]  people who are like, screw auto flowers, it's kind of like, well, maybe you're not the like,
[57:42.610 --> 57:50.210]  if someone lives in an apartment in New York, and or like somewhere, you know, or even like a winter
[57:50.210 --> 57:57.090]  run, right? Like, you don't, you know, and like, does the Bay Area really ever get below zero?
[57:58.690 --> 58:02.930]  No, I mean, maybe there might be like, two or three days of the year.
[58:02.930 --> 58:08.050]  So point being, you can kind of grow stuff year round, which, you know, coming from New England.
[58:08.530 --> 58:15.010]  And now being in LA, it was kind of mind blowing. Like, you know, I'm, I just popped all my barley
[58:15.010 --> 58:23.570]  and buckwheat and kind of grasses that I'm going to grow for the next couple months. And,
[58:24.290 --> 58:29.330]  you know, that wouldn't even be something you'd think about if you lived in the Northeast.
[58:29.330 --> 58:36.050]  The Northeast. I mean, I would almost argue like some of the stuff like your
[58:36.050 --> 58:40.850]  poppies and wildflowers, you have to make sure you don't sprout them too early.
[58:41.730 --> 58:46.370]  Because, you know, it just keeps getting warmer and cold and warmer and cold. And they kind of
[58:46.370 --> 58:52.530]  sprout because they think that it's springtime. Like right now I have wildflowers that are
[58:52.530 --> 59:02.530]  sprouting. So. Okay. So we can pick a winner at the end of this. So the FCP Discord for those who
[59:02.530 --> 59:09.890]  have Discord or who are on Discord, just click that link. And in the Discord, there's a show your
[59:09.890 --> 59:29.550]  grow. Let me share the screen. Got it. There is a show your grow section, which is right here.
[59:35.190 --> 59:45.270]  So anyway, if people post in here. And then. So once you join the Discord.
[59:47.430 --> 59:52.550]  Actually, what you would do, this is and I don't know how to change this, but you go into welcome
[59:53.590 --> 01:00:03.720]  and access all the channels, you just type in exclamation agree. And that basically.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:11.960]  Oops. Yeah. So see, Green Ghost just my gosh, it's almost like Green Ghost is watching the show
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.880]  and following instructions. But yeah, so you go there, you hit the agree, and then that unlocks
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.160]  all the channels and just post a picture of something you're growing, something you grew.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.480]  There's no points for I mean, we want it's a participation thing. So it doesn't matter if you
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:40.120]  grew something that looks awful or that wasn't Instagram. You know, perfect. That's not the point
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:55.160]  here. And then. Yeah. So once you agree, go into show your grow. And I think so when you're wrapping
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:03.000]  up the show, we'll pick a winner. And and I can send something in the land in the spirit of the
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:15.480]  land race genre out to someone. There's Connor. Very pretty. Looks like it's through a microscope,
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:27.460]  right? Yeah, definitely. Like a like a lens on an iPhone or something. But so the way we'll pick
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:37.780]  the winner is if you've posted in the discord, we will then not in the discord, but in the YouTube
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:44.580]  chat, I'll give you guys a hashtag like hashtag. I don't want to say it yet because I haven't
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:54.180]  queued it up, but like hashtag some word. And then we'll auto randomly pick a winner.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:05.450]  And look at that people. That's cool. Yeah, that's I'm actually giving I'm
[01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:14.090]  doing some preservation projects where I'm sending seeds to people and they're doing runs and
[01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:25.450]  Afghanis are a. You know, ties are a little harder in the winter. It's in like my two by four tent.
[01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:29.130]  Two by four tent. It's up, Dave.
[01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:38.730]  Post your amazing looking grow in the discord and a little tip like I've noticed that
[01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:45.210]  that when I would do try to do a seed expansion, I would always try to put my males and really tiny
[01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:53.210]  pots and. That would often cause problems where the males would end up flowering
[01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:57.610]  much, much, much sooner than the females, and especially with
[01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:03.770]  longer varieties, you really got to make sure that you put your males in a nice pot
[01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:11.520]  or at least save the pollen properly. Oh, you're muted.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:23.120]  I was gonna say I assume this came from this. Let's see who posted that.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:31.120]  Indiva, is that correct? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's my boy. Yeah. And Indiva. Indiva.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.640]  That looks delicious. And I think he did that without a freeze dryer, too, just with like his
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:55.460]  fridge. Look at that. Oh, my gosh. I love this interaction. Yeah. So Land Raise Bureau, he a
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:05.460]  long time and you know, we ran out of it, but he had sent me a Siberian auto flower and bush
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:13.620]  court to Stan or let me let me get the pronunciation. Hold on one second. I like this one.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:25.370]  That's a happy man. All right, hold on. Let me go look at the correct pronunciation.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.640]  Bush court.
[01:04:56.470 --> 01:05:00.470]  Actually, we do have more of the bush court of Stan. So that that's one of the auto
[01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:09.270]  the root or Alice that he had. So I'll post more of that up on the website.
[01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:18.310]  Bush court to Stan. Bush court to Stan. It's a village in Russia.
[01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:25.350]  Interesting. And was that like a hemp variety? Or is that a smoking variety?
[01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:33.750]  It's a you mean like, is it like high CBD, very low THC?
[01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:37.430]  Like it's for it's smoke. It's for smoking, right? It's not like a
[01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:42.790]  correct. It's an auto. It's a route or Alice.
[01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:52.710]  And this is where it's from. So right. You see that little red.
[01:05:56.330 --> 01:06:02.490]  Interesting. Between the Volga and the Ural Mountains in Europe.
[01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:12.470]  Interesting. Yeah, I'm curious if anybody in here has smoked any of that kind of stuff.
[01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:18.390]  Or smoked any autos that they like. I mean, you do some autos. What did you think? Did you like
[01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:31.900]  them, Peter? How was the smoke? The one way hold on. The ones I'm growing now I'm growing for seed.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:38.700]  I'm just kind of like playing and cross pollinating things. And but I think, you know,
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:46.860]  what I've seen a lot of is people using the autos to shorten the flowering time on other stuff.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.420]  So like they're trying to capture that fast flowering characteristic,
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:07:00.780]  but then get whatever the, you know, what they're looking for. And the other plant, which is
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:06.380]  typically obviously the taste and the high.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:16.620]  You know, James is telling me about semi autos that they were working where it's like.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.500]  Well, that's kind of I think that's the gist of it is.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:37.380]  I think the best auto I grew was a couple of years ago at this guy Tom's house.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.860]  But it was more just for shits and giggles. And I wasn't like
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:48.100]  I wasn't really thinking about it, but they grew to, you know, four feet tall and.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:55.300]  You know, smell. I think it was like a sour diesel auto and I lost the genetics of that,
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:01.120]  which was kind of a bummer. Yeah, one of the things I've been
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:07.920]  thinking was would be really interesting is to hit like auto to like a super long sativa.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.680]  So you could theoretically get something that would flower for a really long time,
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.960]  you know, and finish in the middle of the summertime. Right. I mean, I assume that it
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.920]  hasn't been done for a reason that maybe it doesn't work. But to me, that seems pretty,
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:30.180]  pretty interesting. OK, so let me queue up.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:46.400]  OK, so. So if you've posted in discord.
[01:08:54.830 --> 01:09:06.850]  In the YouTube chat, type in hashtag land race and then that's what we'll pick a winner from. So.
[01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.810]  Oh, I wanted to touch on something somebody was asking about.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:23.420]  What is it, 2020? What is it, 2020? Humboldt 2020 Mendocino 2020 autos.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.500]  And I've listened to podcasts on them and it's their pod, their
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:36.220]  their autos seem very legit. Their
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:42.620]  explanation on how they bred their autos seemed extremely interesting.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:49.020]  It was a great podcast and I would definitely purchase autos from them. It seems like they
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:54.620]  really do know what they're doing. They were talking a lot about which plants you would
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:10:01.980]  you would choose to reverse to get the right the right flowering timing because you don't
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:08.620]  want a plant that's going to auto that's going to flip too quickly.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.580]  And, you know, if you have, for example, a bud that was like a couple inches tall,
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:19.500]  you also don't want a bud that's going to flip too late. And you have a plant that
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:23.580]  is like a hundred and twenty day auto flower, which is a little bit long.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:29.100]  So, yeah, Mendocino 2020, they were talking about how they have varieties that,
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:34.780]  you know, some that finish in like the 80 day range and some that finish in around the hundred
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:41.020]  day range as well. And I think even some maybe in like around 110 days or so, which seemed
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:45.180]  pretty cool because, I mean, if you can get an auto that's around five, six feet tall,
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:51.340]  still yielding pretty well. That seemed pretty interesting to me.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:58.140]  So just quickly, this stuff just came in from Gnome Automatic.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:58.620]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:08.060]  So that is a full duplex. So this is auto. So this is Bobby's widow. So CMD is, I think,
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:14.620]  kind of something he's been working. So I got to look up what the CMD stands for, but
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:22.620]  that's an auto. That's a photo. That's coal miners daughter is an auto.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:28.860]  This stuff I still need to do data entry with. Interestingly, there's the auto flower cup that's
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:33.180]  going to happen down here in L.A., I think sometime in the new year.
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.500]  Oh, yeah, coal miners daughter. There you go. Thank you.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.840]  Is that GMO?
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.400]  GMO.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:46.880]  GMO.

[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.000]  GMO.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:50.080]  GMO.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.320]  I'm sorry, gnome.
[01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:02.410]  Does he pronounce it genome or gnome?
[01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:07.530]  I mean, it's probably gnome. I don't know. But is that the guy that used to be
[01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:09.210]  Mandalorian genetics or is that something else?
[01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:11.290]  Yeah, full duplex. Yeah.
[01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:18.570]  Actually, this is cool. This is a pinkleberry. Is this auto? What's this?
[01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:20.570]  Auto.
[01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:25.290]  That's a pinkleberry, which what's that? Greensource Gardens?
[01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:31.290]  Anvil. I think there's something that has an anvil cross in it.
[01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:41.170]  This is auto. Hold on. Durban auto.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.800]  Black label cookie. There's an anvil cross.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:13:01.280]  And then this is a coffee cross. Is this auto or regular? That's regular.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.240]  There's Kaya's coffee cross with coal miner's daughter.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.160]  You know what? This is a fast flower. So actually, that's interesting.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.240]  This is an example of a fast flowering.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.440]  So he took the Kaya's coffee and I think the coal miner's daughter is
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.480]  what's giving it the fast flowering.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.880]  So you'd consider that like a semi-auto?
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:42.760]  Yeah, I think fast flowering. Well, I guess it wouldn't be a semi-auto if you took something
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:49.080]  that was like a 16 week flowering and it brought it down to like 12. But that would be
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.520]  faster than the
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.400]  the Thai or whatever it is that it was crossed into. But it's something I've been seeing more
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:11.240]  of people taking something that's long flowering and trying to mix in some auto to speed it up,
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:16.360]  but not losing the essence of what the long flowering one is.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.440]  And they've been working pretty well?
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:27.880]  I well, people and trying to think of what's well, so this is
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.280]  like he sent in two photo periods that are fast flowering. So it'll be interesting to get
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:43.560]  feedback from people. Like I want to bring him on at some point also to talk about his projects, but
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.920]  because he could talk about it. And then if someone was growing it out, I'm trying to think
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.920]  of some other stuff that auto has been. My mind's just blanking right now. I think
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.120]  like Pride of the Lion Seeds probably has some stuff that's fast flowering.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.930]  Yeah, I'd have to kind of look through everyone's stuff.
[01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:17.300]  And like for me, I can put stuff out in let's say like late February, March, it will flower.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:23.060]  But right at the end, right when we're going into May, they start wanting to go back in a
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:29.300]  veg. And so like for me, that's kind of like the biggest issue with running spring things. I would
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:35.140]  want something that has something in its genetics that it still pushes to the end and doesn't want
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:40.500]  to start re-vegging and going back into veg.
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:58.600]  Yeah. Okay, so let me. Okay, so this is we have 16 entries so far.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:11.800]  Yeah, fast flowering. Critical fast. Big in Spain.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:30.950]  I think to me, the big thing with auto is to start it in a larger pot, because if you started
[01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:40.870]  in something small, as soon as that taproot hits the bottom of the pot, it starts to flower. And
[01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.110]  so it could be like this tall when it starts to flower.
[01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:47.510]  When do you?
[01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.550]  When do you?
[01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:53.430]  What's that?
[01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:58.230]  When do you transplant your autos like into like whatever their final size pot or whatever?
[01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:03.350]  Well, so this is good advice that even though normally you'd want to start it in something
[01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:08.550]  small and keep transplanting or transplant one time, it's almost like just put it in your final
[01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:20.620]  pot kind of from the beginning. As soon as it feels, or I'm guessing,
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:27.180]  as soon as it feels constricted in the roots, like it's hitting stuff.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:36.220]  So if you're in a bigger pot, that'll take longer. So it'll get bigger. Yeah, here's the
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.300]  no bueno.
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:44.940]  No transplant for auto. Okay, so here's a question. If I'm going to plant some autos outside,
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:51.500]  and I probably would want to start them inside just because it's going to be like off season
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:59.100]  autoing or off season growing. So let's say I'll put them out like March 1st. Would you guys
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:04.140]  recommend sprouting them outdoors? Because I would still think I would want to sprout them
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:08.140]  indoors and then maybe transplanted even when the pot is like,
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.660]  you know, when there's no roots even really hitting the edges of the pots.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:16.620]  I mean, if you feel like you can time it,
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:28.860]  I think that's more the issue. Like if you get it before it hits the edges of the pot,
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:36.220]  you're probably okay. You know, again, you're playing with the cards you're dealt with,
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:45.340]  which is the situation that's your personal setup. So like if that works for you, yeah. So here's...
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:57.380]  Yeah, the Japanese. Right, right, right, right. So you use the pots that basically
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:03.140]  decompose and it just kind of breaks away. Or maybe even if you like cut a hole in the
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:08.100]  bottom of the pot. So once the roots can also start a five gallon bucket.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:17.220]  Interesting. Yeah. Yeah, I've always wanted to do this is put a clear solo cup or a clear cup
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:22.740]  inside a like a red one so that you can pull it out. Like not I'm not just talking autos,
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:33.860]  but just any plants. But then I always forget to do that. Yeah, the bottomless pot.
[01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:44.510]  I mean, that would be like I have these grass root. Hold on, let me see if I can grab one.
[01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:53.010]  Yeah, I don't know, Bill, if you're talking about my posture, if you're talking about the plants,
[01:19:53.090 --> 01:20:01.410]  as soon as you said bad posture, I like roll my shoulders back. Also, I'm curious,
[01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:07.330]  what time of the year? I mean, common sense would say you would want to sprout your autos the same
[01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:17.330]  time, you know, when things are as warm as possible. But I'm thinking, you know, when are
[01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:24.450]  like the sweet spots that you guys would recommend planting your autos? So this has my
[01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:31.410]  daughter's drawings on it. But this conceptually would work too, right? Like you're going to put
[01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:40.530]  this on a tray and just let it hang out. And then you could theoretically just take the whole plant.
[01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:48.610]  Right. And and put it in even in like a raised bed or something like that's what Steve Cantwell
[01:20:48.610 --> 01:21:01.490]  does in Nevada. Like he'll take a bunch of these and just put them, you know, as the next run in
[01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:12.610]  his raised beds. And then. Yeah, then then once he finishes, he'll cut right and then he'll pull
[01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:18.930]  this like he leaves all his root balls in the raised beds just to break back down. And then
[01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:25.250]  his next run, he'll plant, you know, eight inches or six inches to the right or left of
[01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:29.810]  whatever is still like was just cut down and is still breaking down.
[01:21:33.710 --> 01:21:37.550]  Awesome. Yeah, we got so people growing in loft spaces.
[01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:45.870]  And I mean, even like if you're a beginner outdoor grower, beginner grower in general,
[01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:49.550]  autos are really nice thing because you don't have to worry about your plants getting too big.
[01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:56.110]  It's a really nice beginner plant for people, you know, and it's OK to it's OK to be a beginner,
[01:21:56.110 --> 01:22:00.110]  you know, and just say that you don't want to grow a plant for five or six months. It's
[01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:04.670]  completely normal. And autos are a great way to get involved and get experience as well.
[01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:07.630]  Tomato planters.
[01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:19.470]  Yeah, I'm trying to find a picture of these things and Steve's set up.
[01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:36.500]  So there are autos on the Daga.
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.460]  Yeah, and that's going to keep on growing.
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:58.140]  Also, when your days are starting, they can flower. OK, here.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:07.100]  So you want your flowers, your autos to flower when your days are still fairly long since the
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:19.190]  flowers constantly. OK, so late May is we aim for for sprouting.
[01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:24.550]  Well, I think it also again, I think it depends on where you live. If you live in Maine
[01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:28.630]  in the winter, you're not really getting much, you know,
[01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:34.550]  photosynthesis going on like here in SoCal. It's a nice sunny day out.
[01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:45.080]  Yeah, it all makes sense.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:54.660]  Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of intrigued with like 100 like the 100 day autos.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:04.380]  Yeah, so Pride of the Lion Seeds has a bunch of 100 day autos.
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:05.660]  Oh, cool. OK.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:07.820]  Thank you, Lori.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.140]  Pride of Lion.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:20.340]  Yeah, that's Daniel Morford from Heart Rock Mountain Farms.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:24.780]  Up in Mendocino.
[01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:36.210]  I was in my balcony in Germany.
[01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:38.930]  Yeah, very legal.
[01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:43.730]  Yeah. So again, there's a purpose for everything. I think, you know, out of season,
[01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:52.290]  you know, if you're trying to I mean, I just love that you don't have to do anything and it's just
[01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:57.490]  going to do. It's going to grow a little bit and then flower, right?
[01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:03.970]  Yeah, and I was just thinking, I mean, if you also add in a greenhouse.
[01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:09.410]  That will then, you know, make extend your auto flowering season and make everything
[01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:12.850]  even a little bit nicer for the non ideal conditions.
[01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:16.530]  Yeah. So like here in L.A.
[01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:23.010]  I mean, I was reminded yesterday that I want to pop more auto seeds.
[01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:27.250]  Right. That was my deep thought yesterday.
[01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:33.490]  So you guys pretty much three year round, then you can just grow autos.
[01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:35.810]  I mean, yeah.
[01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:43.490]  Now, do you find that the autos finish nicer off season than the photos do?
[01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:51.320]  Do you do you mean like right now, like in the winter, if I have photos going?
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:51.820]  Yeah.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.440]  I mean, the photos are certainly going to get there going to be much like I have some that
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:06.920]  in the next week or so I'm going to switch to I'm just so I've been bringing them inside every night
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.600]  to go under.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.440]  Oh, for vegging. Yeah, I had.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:18.200]  That light for the photos and but now that they're like
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.840]  they're basically growing into the lights down here.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.400]  So I'm like, all right, I can't keep doing that.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.400]  And I'll probably bring them to their final home now.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.080]  But I'm trying to think of autos.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.460]  Not really.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.940]  I mean, for me.
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:49.940]  Because like what I've noticed is like with my I mean, I only grow photos, but like when I get
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:53.140]  more to the wintertime, the buds get looser and looser and looser.
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:27:00.820]  They get more colorful, but they definitely have less trichomes and the bud becomes less
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:06.980]  for me worth smoking and more just as like ornamental plant and something that's like
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:12.580]  ornamental plant and something that I can observe and like look at the different expressions of it.
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:15.620]  Just because the days are so short and it's so cold.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.900]  I'm curious if it's the same thing with autos.
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:24.260]  You know, when you go into the deep winter, I guess deep winter where I live, you know,
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:25.540]  the deep LA.
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:32.020]  You know, I mean, it's like, I'll give you feedback in about two or three months.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:32.520]  Yeah.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.700]  Because I'm going to pop some seeds now.
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:40.980]  So let's do our.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:42.500]  All right.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.020]  So type in hash.
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:45.220]  Well, here's the hashtag.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:52.020]  So if you posted on the discord.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:02.460]  Sorry, what did he say about the auto flower flower?
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:04.460]  Dow Binks.
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:14.440]  Geno.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.180]  I love the very Italian name.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:27.940]  I have my three daughters, Gemma, Valentina and Carolina.
[01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:36.350]  Jack Herrera.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.680]  Like that's where the skunk turps came from.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.240]  I don't know.
[01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:53.390]  Um, yeah.
[01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:58.030]  How about it being loose from the root of Alice?
[01:28:58.030 --> 01:29:03.950]  OK, so, yeah, he so he said, I agree with what you just said about the auto flowers flower,
[01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:07.470]  about it being loose from the root of Alice cross.
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:30.260]  Yeah, I've wanted to have someone come on just to explain the process of creating autos.
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:31.780]  Like if you want to create like a.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:37.460]  You know, like sour diesel auto, how you go about.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:46.740]  Taking the photo period attributes that you want and the auto and then creating an end product that
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:52.980]  has the taste and smell of this, but the flowering time of that.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.540]  I mean, I listen to a podcast from Mando 2020.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:01.380]  It looked quite difficult.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:06.260]  It looked more difficult than like it sounds.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:10.980]  Like it seems like the next generation, you just have to keep selecting the ones that are.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:12.420]  Yeah.
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:14.980]  Carry on that trait and kill everything else.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:20.180]  Until you finally lock it in that you now have stability in terms of they're all.
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:26.100]  Auto flowering, but I would assume that takes generations.
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:31.220]  I mean, I guess it takes generations, but you also you can't clone.
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:34.900]  So you have to seed up everything partially.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:40.580]  I'm guessing because you need to smoke it, but not have enough seeds to move forward.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:46.180]  And then it's like if you pick a winner, like how do you I mean,
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:48.340]  you just move on from the seeds from the winner.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:49.780]  You can't keep that one.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.380]  Yeah, it is trippy that you can't clone them.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.500]  Once they start, there's no stopping them.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.380]  Yeah, I mean, it was an interesting model and also like.
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:05.300]  So people grow the seeds once and they have to buy another pack.
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.500]  Like to me, that's interesting thing as a breeder, like to,
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.580]  you know, never be able to hold the genetics.
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.620]  It's just one and done.
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:13.700]  So it's kind of cool, but.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.660]  It's like a whole other beast.
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.500]  Really tinkering with regulars and autos.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.000]  Yeah.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.040]  Yeah.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:25.220]  OK, so we're ready to do our drawing.
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:26.740]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:31.150]  All right.
[01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:37.230]  How about we'll wait for one more entry to round it up to 25.
[01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:38.910]  So did he respond to you?
[01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:40.350]  Maybe he's sleeping or something.
[01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:47.790]  So I got a he responded to me at nine with his email and I've never heard back from him since.
[01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:50.610]  So.
[01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:52.910]  I don't know.
[01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:54.030]  I'm sure that I mean.
[01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:57.950]  Life's a crazy thing.
[01:31:58.030 --> 01:32:05.310]  Well, they're probably expensive because, A, they you know, you're not getting as many seeds.
[01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:07.630]  Right, like.
[01:32:09.230 --> 01:32:10.270]  It's a lot of work.
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:21.150]  Yeah, to make a good auto is a lot more work than to make a good photo period seed.
[01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:28.110]  You can't really just take one auto times another auto and just keep make it's it's still a lot of
[01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:30.990]  work to make a good photo period seed.
[01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:33.150]  There's a bit more to it than that.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.940]  Yeah, that's why it costs more money.
[01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.890]  And you can.
[01:32:44.190 --> 01:32:44.690]  I like.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:55.880]  Yeah, I've been giving out when people order seeds, I've been giving out some auto flower
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.280]  in addition to other stuff.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.400]  I don't know who just throws them away or who's like, oh, cool.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:04.620]  But.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.740]  All right, we have an auto enthusiast.
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:17.380]  Yeah, I mean, I think the more the more the enthusiasts, you know, the more that people
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.980]  grow autos, the better they'll be.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.660]  I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:20.900]  Right.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:26.340]  It's like kind of like like what they call hybrid cars.
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:30.500]  You know, you got to make them and go through it and learn and, you know, figure out what
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.780]  works and what doesn't work.
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.300]  And then we'll find stuff that works.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:38.100]  And I mean, my what I'm guessing is that certain terpene profiles, certain effects
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:40.420]  are going to come out a lot nicer and others and others.
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:45.540]  And, you know, that'll just be a thing, you know, like that's what I've listened to in
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:46.020]  podcasts.
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:48.340]  You know, certain things are easy to get in auto form.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:49.140]  Other things aren't.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:53.620]  That's it.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:58.660]  So you can post photos and other channels, but not in the.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.220]  Fungi channel.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.420]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:09.700]  Maybe like I know on an iPhone, it's like a dot H.E.I.C.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.140]  File, but those can post on.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.100]  Discord.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:16.580]  Hmm.
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:18.020]  I don't know.
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.020]  We will troubleshoot offline.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:22.900]  But I'm excited to see your.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:25.620]  Fungi.
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:29.860]  OK, ready?
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:33.780]  All right, here we go.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:36.020]  We got 33 entries and.
[01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:47.830]  Oh, my God, it's Gilbert.
[01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:53.430]  All right, Gilbert, shoot, you got my email address.
[01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:56.390]  Shoot me an email as a reminder and I will.
[01:34:57.670 --> 01:35:01.110]  Get something in the land race genre out to.
[01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:06.630]  Across the entire continental United States, across the pond.
[01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:10.070]  Over Ireland.
[01:35:11.190 --> 01:35:12.630]  Touching down in the UK.
[01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.670]  Way.
[01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:20.950]  As I don't know who says way, Wayne or Garth, but.
[01:35:22.710 --> 01:35:26.180]  Congrats.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:31.220]  Those are gone for it.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:38.020]  We may have another pack or two at some point, but yeah, those are generally gone.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.300]  I still got to come up with.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:47.860]  Probably another six thousand dollars for the wheelchair, but.
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.740]  So we may add some more stuff.
[01:35:59.130 --> 01:36:02.490]  Somewhat some autos or somewhat.
[01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:06.570]  And you'll probably have to remind me on like Tuesday.
[01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:13.200]  Yes, so.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.320]  The UK.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.320]  Trying to think of what to.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:28.800]  Gilbert, you want to do a little seed run project.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:37.290]  Some land racy stuff.
[01:36:37.290 --> 01:36:41.930]  Well, do you want to hold on?
[01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:53.190]  So White Point is growing out.
[01:36:53.190 --> 01:36:53.910]  What did I.
[01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:57.270]  What did I give you?
[01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.990]  Yeah, I'll bring.
[01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:00.070]  Yeah, you got to remind me on Tuesday, but.
[01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:04.070]  You're growing out something Afghani, right?
[01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:12.630]  And how is you should post a picture of those in the in the show your grow.
[01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:15.750]  So he's someone who's in L.A. who.
[01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:22.230]  Is one of the regulars at the Tuesday night smoke seshes and.
[01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:27.590]  He's doing a preservation run.
[01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:32.070]  That's awesome.
[01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:34.710]  Oh, yeah, there we go.
[01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:38.390]  All right, well, I'm going to jump off.
[01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:50.880]  I got to get back to the kids for sure.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.560]  Yeah, I was going to do a little bit of a show and tell for the next, you know, a little while.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:59.280]  I like that.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.920]  Yeah, I mean, here I'll start with this is some sour diesel.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:08.560]  Some nice sour diesel that I grew this year.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.360]  So we're so I'm always interested where people are.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:19.040]  So we're so I'm always interested where people are sourcing their stuff from.
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.120]  So where'd you get that sour diesel from?
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.480]  A black market cloner.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.040]  So it was a cut.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:27.680]  Yeah.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.480]  OK, got it.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:28.720]  Yeah.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:29.600]  Yeah.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.880]  A black market cloner.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.320]  I mean, honestly, I don't know if it's just I've had good luck.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.240]  I'm not that picky about sour diesel.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:40.640]  Every time I get a kind of sour diesel, it's always fine for me.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.200]  I mean, this one is killer.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.680]  It didn't get full sun.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.000]  It was planted a little bit late.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.160]  It still yielded a lot.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.480]  Probably have it was like a pound per plant.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.600]  It's really nice.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.520]  It's actually a little too stony for me.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.800]  Yeah, I really like it.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.200]  Actually, I used a lot of nettle this year.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.720]  That was the thing I did differently.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:09.120]  I poured bought a bunch of nettle on Amazon, like nettle tea.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.680]  It was like maybe a five pound bag and just poured a bunch of it on the soil.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.680]  And I feel like they really just got the turps going.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.720]  It really like it almost gave it too much nitrogen.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.680]  I mean, it really pushed a lot of nitrogen into it.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.720]  And, you know, nettle is like I think it's like this first or second most nutritious plant.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.560]  So like it's nutritious for plants as well.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:38.960]  So, you know, nettle and the plus all the dry silica in the nettle.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:39.780]  Right.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.520]  I think so.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.480]  I think there's like a lot of, you know, vitamins, a lot of different vitamins and minerals
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.760]  and a lot of nitrogen.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:53.040]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not like full K and F or anything.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.120]  I'm kind of like an all the above kind of person.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.840]  But I use that.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:58.640]  I think it worked.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.880]  I mean, it definitely adds nitrogen for sure.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:08.400]  But I think it also added, you know, like turps and it really like it's very loud, delicious
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.880]  blood came out really chunky.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.800]  And like I said before, like it wasn't even full sun, which was just really nice for me
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.520]  and stuff like that.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.880]  Like it's pretty dense.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.000]  And then here, here is the New York City diesel.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:25.620]  Yeah.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.640]  So is that also a cut?
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.560]  Yes, this is a cut also.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.720]  So this cut was gift.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.720]  This cut is actually a non-keeper of New York City by root beer.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.880]  But there's no, but there's no root beer in this.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:52.800]  This was like one of the not keeper cuts from like skunk, skunk tech, mean gene collab or
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.300]  whatever.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.400]  So, yeah, this one is just all diesel.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.360]  Um, so I don't really say it has its reverse root beer.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:06.320]  Um, just, you know, but yeah, it's all diesel.
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.080]  It's really delicious.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:16.000]  I mean, it's a pretty neat cutting like, and if I can pull off some of this, like it almost
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  it's like more noduled out than the sour diesel.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.520]  So you can kind of like see how they're related, which is which is pretty cool.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.940]  Yeah, so it's like, it's like really foxtail-y.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.940]  Yeah, it's like super foxtail-y.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:45.420]  See, it's like, like little pieces like, like that just all compressed, but it smells almost
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:52.780]  louder than the sour diesel, almost like more rudimentary than the sour diesel, but that
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:56.860]  same type of like gassy thing and the plant gets big.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:59.580]  I mean, you know, it's like sour, it gets big, it gets chunky.
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:03.580]  Also, this plant wasn't grown in full sun either.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:09.340]  It's kind of like in a gorilla patch and I mean, it's still is like chunky, you know,
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:13.020]  like those are, those are totally reasonable for like not full sun.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:17.100]  Um, I mean, yeah, like the canopy wasn't super deep.
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:18.220]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:22.540]  Like it didn't go like really down deep in the canopy with fat buds, but that's just
[01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:24.620]  because it didn't get a lot of sunlight.
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:29.900]  But yeah, I mean, it's super, you know, gassy, great smell, great flavor.
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:35.420]  Also really something cool about the diesel is it takes seeds really, really well.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:39.660]  So you can make a lot of seeds and that's something cool as a breeder when, you know,
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:43.340]  like certain plants you can make two or three times as many seeds, you know, it just.
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:44.060]  There's Alex.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.940]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:50.860]  Maybe Alex can jump on with a unique question.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:57.740]  Maybe Alex can jump on with a unique and both show and tell since everyone's harvesting.
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:58.860]  Yeah, man, come on.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:59.500]  Do I need to?
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:06.700]  Yeah, let me if no worries if you can't, but if you can, I'm gonna email you the.
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.300]  So I just need to send it to his email, right?
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:11.980]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:15.500]  And then I gotta go.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:21.580]  Yeah, I mean, those are the two ones that I was like, oh, super interesting.
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:27.580]  So here's the Malawi gold I may be working in the future.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.140]  Really interested about this one.
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:36.300]  So the deal with this Malawi is it almost looks too commercial.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.300]  Like it's so frosty.
[01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:41.020]  It's super frosty.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.740]  I mean, these it's totally seeded up, but it's super frosty.
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.540]  It flowered very reasonably.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:50.140]  This is the Malawi gold from Hayes Man.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:57.180]  I'm very, very, very pleased with this.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.580]  I'm probably going to be working this in the future.
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:01.420]  I made some hybrids with it.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:05.900]  Like hit the hit this Malawi to the sour, hit it to the diesel.
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.500]  A couple other things I've been working with.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:12.860]  But yeah, I mean, this this Malawi has very interesting flavor,
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:17.580]  but it's frost out like, yeah, I think what wasn't Trevor growing out
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:19.580]  sun grown mids growing out the Malawi.
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:28.300]  So I actually look who I actually hit up Trevor about his Malawi.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:29.100]  It's a different one.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.620]  And I got to shut off.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:34.620]  There we go.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:36.540]  Here is a reverb.
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:39.580]  I'm looking for my plug in somewhere.
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.660]  How y'all doing?
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.220]  Look, guys.
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:43.680]  What's up?
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:45.820]  Do you think?
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:48.380]  Thanks for coming on my show before I didn't get a chance to tell you.
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:50.380]  But I really appreciate it.
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:54.220]  I got a lot of excellent feedback and I had a blast.
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:54.720]  Cool.
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:58.220]  I'm glad that we had I had a great time.
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.660]  Yeah, but glad the audience did, too.
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:02.160]  Yeah.
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:03.420]  All right.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.180]  So I'm going to let you guys get to it.
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.500]  Alex, thanks for jumping on.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:07.820]  Sure.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:13.580]  When I used to oil paint models three times a week,
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:16.780]  if the model didn't show up, they'd have me set in.
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:17.500]  I can do this.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:18.800]  Awesome.
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:26.300]  I've got a low charge, so I'm spinning around in circles looking for where I pull up my charger.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:29.420]  The last time I just had my phone connected.
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:29.980]  No, no.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:30.940]  I have a question for you.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:35.100]  I noticed that you had plants that were in your greenhouse that were finishing.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:36.480]  Yeah.
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:40.380]  Yeah, I got stuff that's like only halfway through.
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.580]  I might we're past 10 hours of light or right at 10 hours of light.
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:47.660]  I'm debating buying a lamp.
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:51.180]  I haven't done an indoor production in a while, but finishing some stuff indoor.
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:54.460]  But what was your question, though?
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.260]  I'm sorry.
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:58.940]  No, I was going to say like, it seems like the day, like the hours are starting to get
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:01.020]  to cut off pretty quickly.
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:01.520]  Yeah.
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:02.560]  Yeah.
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:07.580]  When things get down below 10 hours of light, it doesn't do a whole lot.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:11.180]  Especially depending on where you are in the cycle.
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:16.220]  If you try to flip something right now, it ain't going nowhere.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:16.720]  Right?
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:29.100]  And then so I try and have a progressive end of season and then I'll run tests and stuff
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:38.060]  on different varietals at the end, in stressful situations.
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:38.560]  Okay.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:50.380]  And so cold, high humidity, low light, those things all are stress factors that I get to
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:59.820]  test this time of year and can figure out like, right now I got a bunch of really killer
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:03.340]  plants, really small in their molding.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:08.700]  So that tells me and knowing the genetic backup of it, it's like, yeah, I would expect that
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:09.900]  to not do well.
[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:14.620]  And I can tell people before I send those out, hey, this is probably not the best thing
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:16.460]  for a cold, wet environment, et cetera.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:25.260]  But it also gives me, like I got the space, I got the sunshine, utilize it, right?
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.260]  To the best of your ability.
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:31.820]  It's like, I might not need the flower, but I need the information on how those plants
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:33.980]  finish and testing and all that.
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.480]  So.
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:36.060]  No, I completely agree.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:40.380]  I mean, for me, I kind of like doing my males a lot during the off season, because then
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:46.060]  I can kind of dive into a line and see, you know, kind of what they bring to the table,
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.300]  even if it's not the full picture of it.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:52.620]  You know, it's like I get a good portion of what it is.
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:58.540]  And like, for me, the idea of like, I've been trying to grow an equal amount of males and
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:01.500]  females of specific varieties.
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:05.820]  And when I'm able to do that, I feel like I can understand what's in there a little
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:06.320]  bit more.
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:07.980]  You know what I mean?
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:10.060]  Instead of just growing the females.
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:10.560]  Right.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:17.100]  So, yeah, but I mean, I agree with you like this, the flower is not ever of a quality
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.780]  during the off season.
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:23.580]  Like there's really, you know, it's never there's never really enough light from the
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.420]  sun for it to be super dense.
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:28.780]  And then again, with those less than 10 hours, the plant doesn't metabolize very well.
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:36.700]  But sometimes you can get those open flower structure that has trichome all over it.
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:44.460]  It makes for an amazing high content or return per weight on THC.
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:46.700]  I don't know how else to put that, but like.
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:52.060]  Yeah, it gets we can go out and look here.
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:56.220]  The whole turn on the camera and also I realized I'm on vertical and not sideways.
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:58.460]  That's a problem.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:00.940]  I don't know how things are coming across.
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:02.620]  No, I'm looking for.
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:06.540]  OK, so I was looking for my I don't know if I'm upside down.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.780]  Did it did it did it right itself, though?
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:10.940]  Yeah, I'm square.
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:14.940]  OK, I'm going to go on my little holder here so I can I got a little.
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:18.780]  Funny thing, I'd spent.
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:27.100]  However, much money for this gizmo and see where and it's got like lights on it and stuff
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.580]  that's like my ugly mug.
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:34.460]  And it doesn't hold my phone up.
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:38.940]  It's I spent I spent a whole bunch of money for the new tech and it doesn't work with
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:39.580]  my new tech.
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:44.220]  And then I the next day at the thrift shop, I found this old one for a dollar.
[01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:46.380]  It works just fine.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:49.900]  So it's like a selfie wand, right?
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:50.540]  Yeah, kind of.
[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:51.820]  It's a tripod as well.
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:56.220]  And it's not a gamble, but it's, you know, it's a stick.
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:00.860]  I need to get a gamble for some of the filming stuff I like to do.
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:06.060]  Skiing and walking around in the desert, the mountainsides.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:09.820]  But that's a, you know, going through the greenhouse and stuff, too, or just look at
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:15.900]  the plants with a nice smooth glide sometimes makes for a much prettier presentation of
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:16.460]  the plant.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:20.380]  Yeah, I mean, I'll walk around with my like laptop in my hand.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:23.980]  So right now I and you know, I had
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:28.540]  Peter urged me on to getting some better technology and figuring out how to get I get presentation
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:33.260]  better because I was having I didn't realize my I bought these new computers and got the
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:35.260]  shittiest cameras on them.
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:40.300]  I tried to figure out how to get my GoPro to connect up to the camera and to the computer
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:43.340]  and it don't I never really figured that out.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:46.860]  So I just go with this the phone as a really good.
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:50.240]  Yeah.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.280]  Would you factor some of that already up?
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.560]  What are you gonna smoke on there?
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:55.280]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:58.000]  I'm doing this is the New York City right here.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:50:59.200]  New York City.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:50:59.700]  Right.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.280]  It's really nice.
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:06.720]  I mean, I really like it.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:09.920]  Like, yeah, I mean, I really like it.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:11.840]  It's it's it's yields a lot.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:17.920]  I mean, so yeah, I mean, I'll definitely be be making some more of that.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.400]  So yeah, I mean, I'll definitely be be making some some hybrids with that diesel in the
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:22.900]  future.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.180]  I think.
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:34.320]  So yes, I grew some from seed one time I just sour diesel and it was it was quite sour and
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:41.200]  easily and I had a little gram of it in my pocket and went to a wedding up in Idaho and
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:45.680]  down in the basement where all the kids were playing pool and stuff.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.160]  And a little four year old runs up to me like, you smell like my dad's truck after it rains.
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:57.280]  Like, I think I got the right genetic.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.160]  That's funny, right?
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:03.600]  That's that is super funny.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.040]  Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't know.
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:09.200]  There's these really killer like stash bags.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:14.560]  I would I like using those, especially when I travel around.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:24.320]  And they have the ones that have like the the like, words, it has a filter in it has
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:27.360]  a carbon filter in the cloth material.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.720]  You like you can't smell through the bag.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:39.760]  There was I remember they were selling something like like Slim Jim bag or potato chip bags
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.120]  or something like that for a while they were stashed bags like that they were totally just
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:47.280]  like you had some fast food garbage sitting in your car or whatever if you just had it
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:47.840]  sitting there.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:51.280]  They were totally stealth for for yeah.
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:56.640]  Yeah, they had like the it was like whipped cream or like shaving cream containers you
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.840]  like well yeah right right no I got I got the beer and soda cans like that from back
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.640]  in the day to little stash cans right nice.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:16.160]  I'm working on right now is I'm cleaning seed projects and I tell people that I'm I
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:26.960]  don't I'm I took a hate this from breeding I'm trying to count there's 123456789101112
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:31.360]  78910111213 about 15.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:36.320]  And I just cleaned out like five other seed projects.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.480]  You know so that's me not working.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:43.600]  What do you use for separating your seeds from the chaff?
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:50.640]  Well right now the very first thing I'll let me I'm just gonna go ahead and I've been
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:54.720]  wearing gloves lately but I'm not gonna I'm just gonna go real quick and I'll grab right
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:08.300]  there to start with is this is a silk screen right and so my process is I'm coming in and
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:14.460]  and I'm breaking it up over the silk screen right okay and let's see so I'm still not
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:22.620]  even aimed on there we go right and so that's I found I can wash stuff afterwards and still
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:26.620]  get a good return but if I get a good and now I'm doing the static with the nylon glove
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:36.220]  I can get a good wash off right but so after that though so after pushing the the key through I will
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:43.100]  put it back into for instance a small paper bag make sure I have it labeled and
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:51.500]  so for the longest time I mean I did quite a bit of seed preservation for my organic farm I had
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:56.620]  the five acres I was growing 300 different ancient grains uh arc of taste and heirloom
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:55:06.700]  variety vegetables and stuff and um I did screens I did gravity did winnowing did all sorts of you
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:11.900]  know just simple winnowing but I gotta tell you this isn't the prettiest rendition of it but I have
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:20.380]  set up one of these seed sifters right and it's so so simple I got the bucket I got the funnel
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:27.900]  and I just took primarily junk I had sitting around and plexiglass was impossible was during
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:35.660]  um it was during COVID when I built this one beginning of COVID finding plexiglass was
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:42.540]  impossible but I have a variable um switch on the wall and I've got it connected to that right now
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:47.980]  instead of having a plate that you can slide to the variable but on the vacuum I'll go ahead and
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:54.460]  turn it on and see if I can't um set up I got a chair here I can set this thing on we can watch
[01:55:54.460 --> 01:56:01.900]  me work I'll just do one uh quick run of it just so everyone can see how so it used to take hours
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:08.620]  and just like using gravity on like a piece of plywood or masonite or something and make a huge
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:17.900]  mess trying to clean that off right so these plans are available on the internet and um
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:23.340]  it's so simple let's see yeah so I basically got the whole thing
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:29.980]  and screen there and until you get loud for a second
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:33.420]  let me turn on the light you can see it better here
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:50.830]  yeah all right so it doesn't need a lot of power
[01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:13.890]  yeah so I got a clog in there but basically it's so simple this is zigzag here this is called the
[01:57:13.890 --> 01:57:19.970]  zigzag seed cleaner and then there's this chamber here vacuum pulls up there's a big hole at the
[01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:29.250]  bottom and you get a nice clean seed out of the it's impossible to see the angle sorry um but
[01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:36.130]  that's the only way I do it pretty much anymore because everything else is super super super slow
[01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:38.690]  and that thing's the ticket I wish I had it when I had the farm
[01:57:40.770 --> 01:57:48.850]  yeah again Justin I can't really do like onion seeds in there but you can do a lot of um I think
[01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:53.410]  if I had one of those little back adjusters where you you just have a little hole and a plate that
[01:57:53.410 --> 01:58:04.930]  you slide and it um it allows you to adjust the suction a little more um so you can use that
[01:58:04.930 --> 01:58:10.370]  for not just cannabis seeds for all different types of seeds yeah I have used it for other
[01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:16.690]  stuff and again there's that particular one for for a lot of the smaller or super light
[01:58:16.690 --> 01:58:26.290]  seed I think I would really prefer to have um um and the original designs there's like a you put a
[01:58:26.290 --> 01:58:30.930]  hole in the back and you screw a little plate over it you kind of you can let's see there you go you
[01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:37.650]  can um slide that plate in front of the hole and that's how you adjust your suction and how much
[01:58:37.650 --> 01:58:41.650]  tension is getting pulled up to your main tube and the seed falling out right and so there's like
[01:58:41.650 --> 01:58:46.530]  onion seed the shape of an onion seed for instance is so so close in the weight it's like
[01:58:47.090 --> 01:58:50.930]  it's like trying to pan gold and tungsten at the same time right you're always going to have
[01:58:50.930 --> 01:59:02.450]  tungsten in with your black sand and your gold dust so interesting who pans tungsten yeah um
[01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:09.250]  so kind of a separate but connected question do you ever clean your Keith
[01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:16.210]  okay excellent question and yes that's something that like man do I want to teach it so um I have
[01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:21.970]  like I have this amazing hash journey I've gone through it ain't nothing like like um
[01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:29.970]  like what um Frenchy you know can have the story to tell but I make better hash because of of
[01:59:29.970 --> 01:59:36.610]  Frenchy and some other cats that that I've met through internet etc there's one cat named tan
[01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:43.170]  hat who I watched this for a year before it sunk in and I understood it I've been making hash for
[01:59:43.170 --> 01:59:52.690]  20 years before this and I've tried every static tech trying to get it to where so like I got the
[01:59:52.850 --> 02:00:00.130]  first drop method down to where I had never seen any other hash to come close where I'd make these
[02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:05.650]  temple balls it would melt in room temperature right and they go flat just then recrystallize
[02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:11.570]  in room temperature and everything and super pure but but if you want to get that that's like two
[02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:16.130]  percent of what's there they'd be able to do that if you do any manipulation of the flower beyond
[02:00:16.130 --> 02:00:22.370]  the trim process you crush it at all you end up getting all this corruption into it various types
[02:00:22.370 --> 02:00:34.350]  right and the um the static tech or whatever you can I see these guys processing larger quantities
[02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:41.550]  and cleaning it up nicely and it never I tried metal bowls I tried the the paint roller I tried
[02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:50.350]  the um cd cassette right I tried all these different texts I tried the black latex glove
[02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:56.510]  right and none of it freaking worked for me for any sort of efficiency to make it worth my freaking
[02:00:56.510 --> 02:01:03.390]  while to clean it up and I would end up like just dumping my dry sift that was all corrupted
[02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:09.630]  into a ice bath for a quick rinse in an ice bath and and let that stuff float off right but then
[02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:14.910]  you have the different water-based strippings are washed away and it's not dry sift anymore it's a
[02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:24.030]  different product um and so eventually just recently I finally I'm like you know I really
[02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:29.310]  want to see if I can't perfect it because I finally got like water hash live fresh frozen
[02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:33.630]  and live right and you cut the live plant right directly into the ice water it's kind of
[02:01:35.150 --> 02:01:40.270]  it's it's a live hash I don't know how else to put it but it's I've not found anything better
[02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:44.270]  you put that into a jar and the terpenes will recrystallize on the side of the jar and you've got
[02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:51.390]  it'll recrystallize in there as a dry sift um or I'm sorry as a wash um you can't do that as a dry
[02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:55.950]  sift the closest thing is a dry sip is if you wet trim in a very right plant and the tricomes
[02:01:55.950 --> 02:02:03.310]  then you're doing that over trim then wet um okay so here's what I did and I just ran a I just ran a
[02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:10.430]  one little run of it but so I've always worked over a 110 screen and the 110 screen that's
[02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:16.110]  threads per inch my very first one around here somewhere I bought this
[02:02:18.110 --> 02:02:23.310]  1989 or 90 right and this is what I've done and I've got a bigger one since but I saw that one
[02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:31.550]  so that's like your ball 220 and I'm breaking up my seed and I'm using actually
[02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:39.630]  vinyl not latex at this process and pushing it through that first screen right so the next step
[02:02:39.630 --> 02:02:49.390]  here is taking the black latex and this here is 160 threads per inch and that's equivalent to um
[02:02:51.150 --> 02:02:56.510]  um a 90 I think more or less and
[02:02:59.550 --> 02:03:06.830]  so you use the latex covered glove and a couple things happen you create static
[02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:11.870]  and particles get pushed through the next screen size and then try come stick to the sides of the
[02:03:11.870 --> 02:03:17.230]  glove I'm sorry on these portions here and I think I go ahead and put one on so like you guys can see
[02:03:17.230 --> 02:03:23.070]  this and I'm not just telling you because this took me forever to really watching people do this
[02:03:23.070 --> 02:03:26.990]  people teaching it and trying all these things and just being frustrated like why isn't this freaking
[02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:34.430]  working and it has to do with having the smaller size mesh that they'll push through okay and so
[02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:40.830]  I'm going to do a quick and you're pushing through the impurities or the good stuff you're both at
[02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:48.110]  this point okay so I'm on the 160 threads per inch okay these are 40 for the 24 by 30 whatever
[02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:54.510]  this is 18 by 24 from the art supply store prefabricated all right so now I've got this
[02:03:54.510 --> 02:04:01.150]  glove on and I'm just basically doing spreading my hand out and I've also right here have steel
[02:04:01.150 --> 02:04:05.870]  and brass plates that I can freeze my hand on it's about it's about 40 degrees in the garage
[02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:11.870]  here right now it got down to 20 last night outside so I chill my hand keep things cold
[02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:16.750]  you definitely want this below 50 degrees when you do this and start spreading in circles
[02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:22.350]  and we can see so now I've been looking at this under with my
[02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:29.230]  right my microscope so I know what's going on and seeing where what's happening and
[02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:35.150]  we can look at some I think I can plug it in I'm dead but anyhow so then I've got a piece
[02:04:35.150 --> 02:04:45.150]  of parchment or wax not wax special slick paper and I'm brushing this stuff off into a pile
[02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:49.230]  all right so I'm not gonna I'm just gonna do it off to the side right here so y'all can then
[02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:52.510]  that's how you see it like in the bubble man teaching or whatever but one of the things they
[02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:57.070]  don't really I've never really clicked is that you need these screens for stuff to push through
[02:04:57.070 --> 02:05:02.270]  okay so then go through this one here you work it all through it takes a while
[02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:06.670]  and you're getting some very clean stuff off the glove at this point
[02:05:08.590 --> 02:05:13.070]  so now we've got this next layer here that's just what just just push through from that small amount
[02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:17.550]  of work I just did I didn't bang it and that's how I used to all just do tapping and vibration
[02:05:17.550 --> 02:05:23.870]  but this is a whole new thing now and so what we're doing here now and I'm at 230 threads per
[02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:32.240]  inch at this point and at this point here we're pushing through all the crappy contaminants and
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:37.120]  the bulk of the good stuff is sticking to the glove okay so you're using a really nice brush
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:41.040]  I'm using what I call is my hand of Buddha which is the dollar store
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:46.160]  baser brush that I cut at a double compound angle with a razor so it has
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:54.240]  a compound angle to it anyhow so there's 45 this way there's 45 that way or 30 whatever it is
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:06:00.160]  and I'm brushing that off into a pile on a piece of wax parchment let's see there we go sorry
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:12.160]  dyslexia and reverse camera film so this year is producing now six star out of what was zero star
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:20.960]  on that top screen right this is just bulk nasty covered with and then again
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:24.880]  this is this is the biggest bulk screen coming through so this is about a 200
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:32.960]  it's about a 90 and about a 45 I think would be the comparisons and then
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:40.000]  I'm gonna clean this off and and I'll go right through the screen again it just didn't
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:43.120]  again I'll I'll accumulate that and I
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:51.280]  so then down the bottom you see there's a bunch of stuff pushing through the bottom right
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:52.720]  and some of it looks really white
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:07:03.040]  this is it accumulated in a jar looks really white so when I used to just do the the 110
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:10.560]  looks really white so when I used to just do the the 110 and then that's it I had all half
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:16.640]  is what I determined half of or more of the bulk is coming out as contaminant not the bottom side
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:25.280]  okay and what that is vegetation and the sessile stock of the trichome right it's the globular
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:31.280]  heads the part that we really really want and then the vegetation either gets broken down into
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:37.600]  really small particles or what I've been having happening is it's accumulating into these little
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.360]  balls you might have seen as my hand was spinning around I'm getting little balls and I need to see
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:48.160]  there's a way to avoid that with more chill or what have you but those tend to be a nucleus of
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:52.560]  vegetation and then some heads will accumulate on there and so I'm separating that out in the
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:08:00.080]  final product I believe my my laptop just died but I have photographs I've been taking and we
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:07.280]  can take a look at those real quick if I can figure out plugging that in let's see I got
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:15.840]  let me plug this one in real quick again so question do you find the hash from from seeded bud
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:21.360]  is of a different I mean I assume it's of a different quality of non-seeded bud but like
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:25.840]  do you like what are the what are the different qualities that you observe I would love to I would
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:34.400]  love to do a comparison lavatories you don't see the coas on that there is the main thing that we
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:40.160]  can know from visual inspection and angelistic just understanding the plant growth is that
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:48.080]  seeded flower the the seed coat matures faster than the flower that's not seated or any portion
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:57.040]  of the flower that's not seated right and so that's getting matured faster it's getting I
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:02.480]  think you're going to end up we discussed this years ago in different like when I was in the
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:09.120]  probiotic farmers alliance I was chatted about with Alan Adkinson in depth he was all about having
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:14.640]  lightly seeded flower and said that was the strongest and best and we got into these deep
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:22.560]  discussions about how that little bit of slight different terpene development and and how you
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:27.120]  might be having a little bit of cbn in there when the rest of it's not quite as mature and so it's
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:33.680]  a slight amount of cbn and different different aspects like that that are playing in to what
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:40.160]  exactly is in that final product right I don't know how else to describe it besides that
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:49.440]  yeah I mean to me it seemed like it had a like the flavor was definitely quite different
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:59.120]  I felt like it wasn't like as loud you know like the the terpenes were definitely like not as loud
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:05.600]  just because you know the plants were spending more time on reproduction reproduction instead
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:12.880]  instead of trying to scare away bugs or other things that those terpenes do right
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:18.880]  or the smell yeah one thing that it can do is it's trying to reproduce the smell of rotten
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:24.320]  flesh so animals will come in and eat it and haul it away right um
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.200]  and that that makes perfect sense I was just growing something that smelled like blood and
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:36.880]  meat right I would I would smell it I'm like damn I'm hungry every time I'd smell it I'd start
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:42.160]  thinking about food would that would that be something lean towards an afghanica yeah
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:51.120]  definitely genetic yeah as opposed to sweet florals that well I get a lot of mangoes and
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:58.000]  tropical fruits and some of the afghanica stuff but um definitely different regions of the of
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:08.400]  the country have different cultivars and um so I've got I got my plug in on my laptop that doesn't
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:19.040]  seem to be firing off here let's see you notice that the um seeded material hashes are darker
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:22.480]  or not necessarily I you know
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:28.880]  I have a really really really really really hard time getting anything that comes out blonde
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:37.040]  um I I do get blonde hash but as soon as I if I press it at all the oil comes out and it goes dark
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:45.600]  right so for me to keep blonde hash I have to do it where there's I've I've put no um pressure heat
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:52.000]  pressure heat on the press and it's just kind of like this extremely lightly pressed um
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:56.080]  all right so let me clock in here and see it's
[02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:06.410]  and you know it's interesting you're saying like when I would press
[02:12:07.610 --> 02:12:13.130]  certain types of keith and a lot of times the dryer stuff I also had the experience that it came out
[02:12:13.690 --> 02:12:22.650]  fairly dark um yeah it did come out really dark um and almost a lot of it came out kind of like
[02:12:22.650 --> 02:12:28.730]  shattery which was like a really interesting consistency right you know especially how clean
[02:12:28.730 --> 02:12:38.250]  you can get that stuff and um this I can't wait till I have money or energy to spend on on
[02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:42.650]  investigating these things through laboratory because like somebody has asked me it's like
[02:12:42.650 --> 02:12:49.450]  what determines why some temple balls get stiff as a rock and others stay goopy right and then
[02:12:49.450 --> 02:12:53.450]  I've had ones that were stiff as a rock when I made them but three years later they are supple
[02:12:53.450 --> 02:13:00.490]  and soft as the ones that are you know are softer than stuff that's what I call full cold melt when
[02:13:00.490 --> 02:13:06.650]  it's like that to start with um and and sometimes this can be really dark sometimes they can be
[02:13:06.650 --> 02:13:12.490]  chocolatey sometimes they can be kind of a lighter color or have have green plant matter in them and
[02:13:12.490 --> 02:13:20.890]  I've never had a rhyme or reason to figure out exactly what's going on there and let's see so
[02:13:20.890 --> 02:13:34.390]  I gotta close that down here we go so let's see I'm gonna let's see here all right um
[02:13:34.710 --> 02:13:38.870]  can we see what's on my screen there very good let's see let me do oh wait you just
[02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:48.440]  this is I'm totally jimmy reagan here I'm gonna try yeah you can make him full screen again
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:57.480]  I'm on my phone just mouse over him down below and and uh do click on solo
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:58.760]  do click on solo
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:06.600]  yep all right here we have how's that look to y'all can you see that
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:11.640]  this is mites this is mites and predatory mites and eggs
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:23.800]  all right so let's see here let's see um all right trichoma looking up close
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:28.440]  let's go this way though because I wanted to show there we go so what we're looking at here
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:35.640]  is that bottom that last pile at the very bottom that I showed you guys
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:43.000]  and that's um the residues that I'm pushing out that very bottom the the 230 thread per inch
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.640]  or people use a 40 um
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:56.760]  um all right so this is the cleaned up this one time through that static process those heads there
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.560]  and so we're looking like you know we're looking at 10 000 x whatever
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:14.760]  and so this is maybe one of the lesser cleaned version but um if we look at it here we start
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:24.280]  seeing this is you see the stalks you see the vegetation right and so it cleans up to that
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:32.360]  and that's the leftover on the bottom so it's pretty simple but I never got every time before
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:37.240]  I got those bottom screens the only it would look the same every freaking time it'd be like that
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:44.520]  like it's like oh there's no change right so there's some beautiful pictures
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:47.320]  there
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:52.120]  anyhow I hope if I can't see the questions or whatever but if if anyone's got questions about
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.200]  that I'd love to share whatever I've learned about that says it makes a huge difference
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:03.080]  in so many levels to understand that and again watching people having a mind you know understanding
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:06.920]  things the way I understand them it took me a full year watching people do that process
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:12.040]  almost every day on Facebook and just going okay I see him doing it it's not working until I got
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:19.320]  the bottom screens and really getting that um so can you go can you go over um you can purchase
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:28.840]  these these screens just that like you said online blick art supplies any art supply store
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:37.080]  should have pre-made um silk screens and then there's tons of of you know industry specific
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:43.720]  um as well they'd be way cheaper I'm sure at blick yes I think so and then but you just got
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:48.840]  to look up online there's plenty of digital um thread per inch to micron converters so you
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:55.160]  understand what you're looking at there and see how close we got so here's here's pretty cool
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:59.320]  where the abs the obsessions closing down right this is what I'm looking for anymore when I'm
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:06.760]  looking for ripeness is the shape that thing getting longer all right getting that thing to
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:16.520]  get elongated but if you see how here it's it's like doesn't pinch down at all right and this
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:21.160]  one here totally pinches down and it starts to build in and go into that and that's where that
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.960]  one's ripe and that one's just starting this one's totally ripe you see that down here it's ready to
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:33.240]  pinch right off all right and so even with doing this when they're milking there's only a few of
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:43.880]  these ambers in there it's still I still get tan when I'm finished with my product right and so
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:49.480]  I think the freeze dryer recrystallizes things and you don't get oxidation that makes a huge
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:54.920]  difference on how they keep that shit blonde I really can't fathom otherwise I'm doing you know
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:18:02.120]  right behind I have a wine chiller and a you know cooling a dryer the the dryer only gets um
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:10.280]  used when it's below 50 degrees it can get it comes out totally blonde when it's dry and then
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:17.960]  I go to roll it no ball and it turns brown so I mean I'm not familiar with many people making like
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:25.000]  blonde temple balls usually I would just assume they would just like squish it into like a blonde
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:31.720]  rosin I yeah yeah no I do see I do see like the duchess she presents stuff that still looks blonde
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:37.640]  when she's rolled into a ball um I've seen some of Frenchy he almost gets into a chocolate color
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:43.320]  but I've seen his with some lighter color to it as well and I think these are the
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:48.760]  Beldea right you can see the difference in the modern hybrids versus the the Landrace
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.960]  but again I was checking them for when they were ripe using this thing and then
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:58.280]  then we get back into a hybrid here and then Beldea again
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:09.880]  you worked any like a straw nana or like banana og I've not had any banana anything
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:18.440]  honestly or gmo like those ones I've got a gmo someone gave me a cut of the gmo and it's um
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:27.720]  it's quite phenomenal um it doesn't produce very much as far as um everything I've tried
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:36.600]  I've not gotten a large production off of the any given plant um but I definitely the amount
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:43.320]  that comes off of it when just trimming is is phenomenal um and if you crush it up and
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:49.480]  sift it or wash it it's it's a dumper they say right yeah it's got a very distinctive flavor
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:52.840]  I can't take more than two hits of that stuff in the bong I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:01.240]  yeah uh but when and this is one of the ones where I really realized that how different um
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:09.160]  hashes from the flower when I take a hit of the hash on the on the nail um it usually
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:14.840]  washes it's got nice big heads and they they clean up nicely however you sift it um
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:23.640]  it never it never him gave me that that heart rush uh when I smoke it as hash and that I started
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:31.160]  checking that on some other strains and it's like hey this is a very real difference and people say
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:36.840]  it's not the same when you smoke ash but that's it on the high end or the couch end it cuts those
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:42.200]  those ends off and you've got that middle you got that flavor you know it's not the same flavor
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:49.160]  either because it changes as it mellows and stuff um your water if you're water washing you're losing
[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:57.320]  water soluble terpenes and dry sifting you're losing volatile uh organic compounds the ones
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:05.720]  that just leave when it's cooler so it's a it's a toss-up as to which exactly I'm I'm really digging
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:19.960]  this um the fresh frozen was it the one that uh 180 to 90 that seems to be for most of what I'm
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:26.360]  producing the sweet spot for I'm gonna press it it just melts into itself and leaves extremely
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:33.400]  small residue on the nail um yeah it crystallizes I mean if you don't even need to to squish it into
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:38.680]  rosin that's yeah yeah except for like how do I convince the kids that only smoke rosin I don't
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:47.560]  touch hash right it's like you should touch this um yeah I mean if it's clean enough to to burn on
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:54.680]  a nail because I mean rosin in general is way you know is notoriously dirty you know what I mean
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:00.520]  gets like a lot of chas on there whatever yeah yeah no I've got I definitely have tried various
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:09.400]  different grades and sometimes some of the um some of the stuff leaves gunk other times there's this
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:17.000]  like like even with dho it'll be still stuff there that's just not vaporizing right and I don't know
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:27.320]  what I just clean it out and put some more in but I'm not the I'm not the authority on stuff um
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:35.640]  I have another hash question for you um because I'm also re I'm I'm getting into I'm
[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:45.080]  recently getting into sift a bit um have you ever tried using a vacuum with a screen over it to suck
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:56.540]  out impurities no no I'm not I'm trying to think about like I was thinking of taking like a bubble
[02:22:56.540 --> 02:23:05.020]  bag screen like let's say like the what is it the 25 35 like the tiny one putting that yeah yeah
[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:09.900]  and then I'm thinking to like clean it out right because like I have like a
[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:15.660]  Paul and tumblr right so like you can get okay then that's what I was gonna say combined if you
[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:21.100]  can figure out some way to combine that with with like a hashulator the the the pollen
[02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:28.860]  tumbling dremel right because that's a static clean system isn't it it produces static it's
[02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:34.140]  just like it's a tunnel right it's just the tube with a screw with a key screen yes I understand
[02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:38.860]  that has a static system something's going on with static with that that gets that key to come out
[02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:45.260]  really clean I'm not 100 sure on this but that's something I got I was trying to figure out how I've
[02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:52.220]  seen first seen him I know Milo created that right and then but there's guys in Morocco I've seen
[02:23:52.220 --> 02:23:58.140]  cleaning their Beldia with it and just like coming out pure beautiful white I'm like how the
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:02.700]  fuck do they that was one of my first like you know I need to learn more and probably 10 years
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:09.740]  ago when I seen that so like for me my stuff it's like at first it comes out nice and then of course
[02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:16.060]  the longer and longer that you run it the greener it gets yes so it's like you know I'm trying to
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:21.900]  figure out how do you clean the green stuff because yes this point it's not squishable like
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:28.220]  you can't squish it into rosin it's it's too there's too much right so material if you've got
[02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:33.740]  more contaminant than a four star and it just comes out tasting like that burnt popcorn flavor
[02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:39.660]  that just tastes like ass you don't want to hit them that just like what and so yeah getting that
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:45.740]  first drop that's what like the whole progression of my hash magan was like I used to wet trim and
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:52.540]  it would be my hash was literally came from the wet trim process and whatever fell through that
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:58.300]  little teeny silk screen I'm showing you here right whatever I whatever fell through that
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:03.980]  little fella as I wet trimmed that was what I made my hash out of it was a small
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:11.980]  like a half a percent of available trichoma but the shit was just like straight full melt tasty
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:20.300]  ass good stuff and then I wanted to make more and after my mentor around 2000 taught me what he
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:26.940]  learned in Morocco I started crushing it up and that again that first first drop would be great
[02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:30.460]  but you start crushing up the material and you start pushing through I'm like oh more and more
[02:25:30.460 --> 02:25:34.780]  and more and more is coming through and vibrating and talking I had a friend who was growing in
[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:40.860]  Cali a big time and he'd tell me what they were doing with setting up a rotary vibrator on a silk
[02:25:40.860 --> 02:25:46.060]  screen right and so I'm like okay what's this process and and you start working through and
[02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:50.220]  it's like yeah there's lots of contaminant and that's why over the years I've tried all these
[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:55.260]  static techs all these different static techs and they all failed to me until I finally dropped the
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:26:00.780]  coin and bought those screens that I pushed the shit through and you're getting the good stuff on
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:07.820]  the side of your hand and and so one thing I left out is you'll end up having like a medium the best
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:14.860]  stuff comes at off that glove and then you end up at each screen level you have a um accumulation of
[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:20.060]  contaminant and an accumulation of medium grade right but the best stuff's getting brushed off my
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:26.860]  glove and to me it's like okay that is worth the energy and the effort dry sifting's hard it's slow
[02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:32.380]  unless you you know if you can figure out some way to make that vacuum work with your tumbler
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:40.380]  itself um or the after I I the tough thing is securing the screen in the vacuum with the flow
[02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:47.900]  right this is what I'm trying to is how I'm thinking how you would um you know if you had a large
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:55.340]  like a small shop vac with a large carpet head and you had that under a screen just sucking it as you
[02:26:55.340 --> 02:27:01.180]  but the thing is when you're doing the static tech you're pushing that glove around it's literally
[02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:06.700]  creating a static charge and I like on that top screen the credit card creates enough static
[02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:12.300]  charge it just drives you you see everything real line just like it's um iron filings and a magnet
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:18.620]  filings and a magnet right so on my 110 top screen that much static gets charged just just
[02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:25.180]  from that credit card and the material and I'm finding like way faster than tapping the screen
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:30.460]  and bouncing it using that glove and that static it's pushing stuff through and it's it's like
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:36.140]  panning for gold you go through that process and the gold sits at the bottom if it's there right
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:45.020]  um yeah I without experimenting I couldn't answer fully right but I've just found tech that works
[02:27:45.660 --> 02:27:49.020]  and I wouldn't I have got no reason to try anything else at this point
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:57.500]  you're saying so like as your hand touches the material the trichrome stick to your gloves and the
[02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:03.660]  the the leaf material keeps going through the different screens it gets it either goes through
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:08.780]  or pushes away all right and there's literally there's literally this the static charge occurs
[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:13.100]  and I'm going to see if I can't get it to create right here with just the small amount I broke up
[02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:21.180]  here and the credit card um so we can see it and um it's pretty amazing I might I might put on one
[02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:26.140]  of these vinyl gloves and get it how I was making it do that same process because that's exactly
[02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:33.420]  what was making it work there so we've we've got some material here and here comes a vinyl glove
[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:40.380]  into my hand I hate gloves but working at the restaurant I started to actually use them and um
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:47.260]  the other is just like cleaning your hands 10 times a day gets old and end up wasting hash so
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:56.140]  I'm literally just crushing it up right and so before I started using this bottom push I would
[02:28:56.140 --> 02:29:00.140]  never do this because you just get contaminated in there and it's horrible but I'm literally just
[02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:07.340]  doing that okay so whatever trichoma is there has gone through already there's stuff stuck to
[02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:13.580]  my hand but this is vinyl and not the latex and so it has a different charge going on here's my card
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:20.700]  okay you can see it right here see I was talking about it lines up like static
[02:29:20.700 --> 02:29:26.460]  like like filings of iron see that so that's fully static charged you can see all this
[02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:31.180]  this right here that's the that static charge makes that lineup happen
[02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:38.780]  so anyhow that it's dissipated at that point so if I go like this again let's see if it
[02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:43.020]  comes back and we're doing just some mad science right here right now so you can all see
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:49.020]  and there it is again that realignment of those static charge
[02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:54.380]  particles you see shit jumping around all right there's the vibration that occurs the
[02:29:54.380 --> 02:30:00.620]  micro vibration but there's also um and I'm bummed I thought I got a picture of
[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:09.730]  well we can go ahead and look at it let's see I'm gonna go ahead and put that thing on there
[02:30:13.810 --> 02:30:19.170]  and so that's the microscope on the I'm gonna go I'm gonna close this one down
[02:30:19.970 --> 02:30:21.010]  where's my camera
[02:30:22.930 --> 02:30:25.920]  oh shit where's my camera
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:40.660]  sorry folks I am not the best with this uh computer but somewhere on here I can open this
[02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:51.220]  oh come on there it is all right um I love DIY I mean I'm a little this person is saying Pam is
[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:59.220]  saying using a pantyhose for like a DIY and like a strainer yeah well if you look at if you look at
[02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:08.660]  the um if you if you look at how the guys in Afghanistan do it they push it through a bunch
[02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:12.820]  of different screens and the last thing they'll have is this really fine cloth and they just shake
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:22.500]  out I'm having a hard time finding my camera here on there it is okay um they're shaking out
[02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:30.820]  the dust out the bottom and it's the same same kind of thing all right this is what I wanted to show
[02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:36.020]  let's see here
[02:31:36.580 --> 02:31:44.320]  there we go that's that's the screen there's those little bits of there's this little bits
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:55.010]  of plant matter and see how it's driven through but that's the little bits of whatever there right
[02:31:56.930 --> 02:32:05.470]  I had some earlier so I trichoma attached but that might have been a different level of screen
[02:32:05.470 --> 02:32:12.110]  let's see here that's super cool right no it's uh so this is the stuff that's
[02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:19.950]  the first layer as it goes through let's see it's literally right on here that I'm working right now
[02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:28.270]  and then um just a second again that's the wood table so you see all sorts of
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:39.400]  bits and pieces of the trichoma just around the workspace here right and that's the bottom one
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:45.660]  interesting so I already showed you what it looks like going through so yeah that's the
[02:32:45.660 --> 02:32:49.500]  that's like in real time as opposed to those pictures I had before a whole another run
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:53.100]  but same kind of stuff and um
[02:32:56.540 --> 02:32:59.740]  and then I showed you what I showed you was what it looks like after it gets worked on the bottom
[02:33:00.220 --> 02:33:04.860]  and then I showed you what I showed you was what it looks like after it gets worked on the bottom
[02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:13.900]  end there um well man I appreciate that that was uh that was yeah informative that's it's like
[02:33:13.900 --> 02:33:20.300]  uh people taught me and did a lot of work figuring it out and again like I'm not dim-witted it took
[02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:25.420]  me a while to really understand that so like I know it's not the simplest thing to just grasp
[02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:31.740]  right that's um but it works and so it's like if you think about it like driving an automatic car
[02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:38.140]  you don't got to know how it does it put it just do the process and go um temperature is huge you
[02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:49.900]  definitely want it below 50 if not down like 30 right um yeah hell yeah dude that's that uh yeah
[02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:55.580]  that's that was super informative I mean we could yeah yeah that was super informative perhaps
[02:33:55.580 --> 02:34:01.100]  we'll have my friend Nick come on with you and can talk some more hash he's a he's a big hash
[02:34:01.100 --> 02:34:05.820]  guy and something I really like about him is that he doesn't have a freeze dryer he just uses like
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:13.420]  his fridge and right um his stuff comes out very very light in color and you know he's very
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:21.180]  versatile with his hash too so like you know it's a it's all good right right no I occasionally get
[02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:28.220]  some light color stuff it it's it's it's a rare it ain't quite hen's teeth rare for me but it's um
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:38.620]  it's definitely out of pounds it's in it's in the couple of ounces realm it's light when I do it um
[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:44.220]  and it's very strain specific too like there are certain strains that really lend itself a lot more
[02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:56.900]  to to that kind of thing I think uh yeah I I'd like to ask someone like Bird what he thinks about
[02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:04.580]  it or or uh Jindo right and why if they with their experiences on it I know sometimes like purple
[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:11.540]  it definitely adds any any amount of purple in the trichoma definitely even if it's even if it's in
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:25.540]  the not in the trichoma it can um definitely add to the darkness um I don't know how much this the
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:35.700]  the letting stuff get to finish you know two percent or ten percent amber trichome right how
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:42.260]  much that affects it oh it affects it hugely for sure I've I've definitely made some stuff that was
[02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:49.700]  on the earlier side and it came out nice and light right right yeah so I definitely noticed
[02:35:49.700 --> 02:36:00.100]  that for certain when I blasted or like if I did um fresh frozen into the cylinder before hitting it
[02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:07.380]  with the BHO um that definitely made a huge difference with it being like a straw colored
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:15.940]  versus an orange or or light amber right um yeah Hawaii sustainable is saying genetics and I I would
[02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:22.020]  agree I mean I've grown stuff side by side and you know some of the stuff squishes light and just
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:28.980]  comes out you know bright in color and other stuff comes out dark and they you know the dark stuff
[02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:34.180]  often is better you know what I mean is a better product but like you know people have got this
[02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:40.180]  mental thing about light colors yeah it's um yeah I think I think the amount of terpene in there has
[02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:46.180]  got something to do with it right um I guess had good had really good terpenes had very like
[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:52.740]  bright you know what I mean like effervescent bright terpenes like when you open it it's you
[02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:56.580]  know it smells nice as opposed to some of the dankier ones where you kind of have to like
[02:36:56.580 --> 02:37:03.860]  you know I mean like stir it up a little bit so like I've never I I've only someone's gifted me
[02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:09.940]  like a quarter gram of broth in once right and then besides that most of what I've pressed
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:15.140]  just tastes like that burnt popcorn shit because I don't have a proper tool to do it with
[02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:22.260]  so um hair straightener I looked at one today I thought about actually this morning like I should
[02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:29.060]  make myself a little dab around like now I got stuff to do but um I haven't shown people in a
[02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:35.060]  while but I'm about to show you all right now it was a gift I was given by one of the guys that
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:42.660]  started the first medical electives in the bay area and this is what they used to use to press
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:51.380]  all of their hash with and so it's a rubber vulcanizer and so it's got it's got plates
[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:56.900]  and you can put some serious pressure on it right and it's great for pressing slabs
[02:37:57.860 --> 02:37:59.300]  of unrefined
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:03.140]  and um
[02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:10.100]  you know before I understood this process and going through those whole cycles of getting
[02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:14.660]  more plant material that we were discussing there like you're talking about the longer you let your
[02:38:14.660 --> 02:38:19.540]  cylinder run the more corruption gets into it and stuff and it's really learning how that whole
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:24.100]  process works and and then like learning one of the things I learned through this whole thing was
[02:38:24.180 --> 02:38:28.180]  that's the best stuff we got coming out of Afghanistan was like their third or fourth
[02:38:28.180 --> 02:38:34.820]  cycle uh on the screen it wasn't their best stuff that I was getting as a kid that we thought was
[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:41.940]  like so phenomenal right and uh yeah yeah I know as you learn all this stuff it it makes a huge
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:50.420]  difference in the like and if we can see the color differences right there that's all the same plant
[02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:58.500]  oh with different different screen sizes right so that's some of the um happy day chocolate tie
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:08.740]  uh acapulco gold hybrid all right delicious oh yeah right so that's that's age in a year maybe
[02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:18.820]  they're like here's a great example of like uh I see in Afghanistan backstand you see quite often
[02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:31.690]  that the their their half bazaars they'll have um either cellophane wrapped chunks and or buckets
[02:39:31.690 --> 02:39:37.770]  where it's just they'll have buckets that are just literally a bucket full a five gallon bucket
[02:39:37.770 --> 02:39:43.770]  and it's like chunks they've never pressed it right it's just pure clean keef and I don't know
[02:39:43.770 --> 02:39:49.370]  if we can see this here but you can see where the rubber band's pressed in it goes from light
[02:39:49.930 --> 02:39:57.210]  to dark in those lines because that's where the trichome heads were burst and the oil comes out
[02:39:57.210 --> 02:40:04.490]  right and so this is that totally shows that whole process of darkening going on right this has been
[02:40:04.490 --> 02:40:11.450]  for like a year and a half or where they have says uh this is 63 grams the breath of red dragon 2020
[02:40:11.450 --> 02:40:19.210]  greenhouse sifted in March 21 90 to 20 size on the sift or on the wash
[02:40:22.170 --> 02:40:28.810]  all right so that's just just age in a way like fine wine in the cellar but again you can see how
[02:40:28.810 --> 02:40:41.990]  just rubber bands pressure I either besides that just kind of use my hands but using um
[02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:52.760]  um those ones there have all just gone dark with age they were super blonde a couple years ago
[02:40:56.870 --> 02:41:04.630]  I just like to store it like it's um like it's wine and go back after it at some point um
[02:41:05.270 --> 02:41:09.910]  I had some huge slabs here we go that I've used that press for that I want to show you
[02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:17.830]  and so sometimes some of that lesser quality when you heat it up and press it and now it used to be
[02:41:17.830 --> 02:41:22.470]  hard as a rock but now it's like it's got flexibility to it after a couple years of
[02:41:22.470 --> 02:41:29.510]  aging so same thing uh grown 2020 washed out this is Jaeger from 21.
[02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:39.710]  That looks nice I just brought out some of my aged hash here's some
[02:41:41.310 --> 02:41:45.790]  what is this dry sift from last summer's outdoor mix
[02:41:48.910 --> 02:41:58.430]  here's oh yeah nice it's been kind of like pushing it against this container right right
[02:41:58.990 --> 02:42:04.510]  yeah you know I mean it's not my it's not my super strong point but you know the
[02:42:05.230 --> 02:42:12.430]  most important part in making good hash is to grow good weed right a lot of a lot of this though
[02:42:12.430 --> 02:42:18.510]  you do these bulks and it's like okay so I'm running 300 seeds yeah and uh 30 to 300 seeds
[02:42:18.510 --> 02:42:26.670]  usually uh sets a 72 anymore especially if I get past the f1 and f2s um and so they're basically a
[02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:31.950]  and so they're basically a tray but I've ended up having you know 30 females and I only need
[02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:38.910]  one to five and um again it's it gives the cancer medicine I don't really have a bunch of people
[02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:43.870]  buying flour for me and for whatever I do have a few medical clients for different things and so
[02:42:43.870 --> 02:42:49.550]  I have to have diversity for them and this is just I take all that breeding stuff and do this with it
[02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:56.030]  for myself and then make a cancer medicine to give away with the residuals so it's um
[02:42:57.870 --> 02:43:01.870]  and again and at some point in time I'm going to get to share all this with folks
[02:43:03.550 --> 02:43:10.590]  whether it's one of the Tuesday sessions or um working on getting this place this home set up my
[02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:18.590]  remodeled and rented out so I can go traveling again in national parks and stuff but yeah man
[02:43:18.590 --> 02:43:23.870]  let me know if you're ever in SoCal or in Northern California we'll we'll sesh up for sure
[02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:28.750]  right right no I uh I don't get out there too often anymore I used to get out to Cali
[02:43:30.430 --> 02:43:36.110]  two to five times a year especially when my daughter was was younger but it's been like
[02:43:36.110 --> 02:43:43.790]  once in the last two years twice in the last two three years um she's 19 uh 18 now and uh
[02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:52.400]  yeah and I got fam they're all down SoCal now again I don't think anyone's in NorCal
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:59.680]  too well my my brother is fire engine captain at Willits um and then he also but he lives in
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:05.840]  Morro Bay he's the furthest north that's cool though I mean I know where Willits is that's
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:13.120]  that's deep right he's a fire captain I mean there's tons of crazy fires out there
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:23.360]  oh yeah yeah no he's he's um he's been fighting wildfire since 1987 so he he does like he splits
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:28.800]  his time between captain I think he's the relief captain there and then his main assignment anymore
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:40.320]  is he runs the slurry the slurry uh um station at um passive robles airfield for loading the uh
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:50.560]  the the the helicopters and and um sorry the air tankers and but he also does like helicopter
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:55.760]  manager so like like if you see a black hawk dropping buckets he's he's flying around in
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:00.560]  there with the pilot counting the hours and and keeping things safe etc um
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:07.360]  yeah the stuff that needs to get done in the world right he he actually so
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:15.600]  that brother was Snoop Dogg's first um contract grower in the early 90s and uh
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:20.720]  you ever hear Snoop talking about smoking the kush it was my brother's uh Henry Kissinger
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:29.040]  which is basically I believe is master kush hindu kush and um but it stank like a freaking skunk and
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:36.000]  that was the basis of my breeding was getting that when we started in the early 80s we were
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:42.160]  just looking to reproduce killer skunk and some guy's uncle who grew in the triangle sent my
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.360]  brother like 30 seeds and he selected that one and so that's that's the base of all which is
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:58.320]  still one of my best hatch plants is is my dr dream all cure and um yeah once upon a time ago shit um
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:00.640]  he took all the money though there's people like um
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:08.000]  oh brain farting on names and companies right off the bat but they're like one of the microbes
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.520]  companies in the organic world one day and in the project farmers alliance he was he was yapping off
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:19.280]  about the best weed he'd ever smoked and he basically described exactly what my brother
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:24.480]  was growing and where it came from right so he had a bunch of houses he couldn't you couldn't
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:28.800]  have 2 000 watts growing back then because camp would kick your door in and they would have a
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:33.280]  thousand watt with two 400s and they would cycle that through like it was daylight and get the
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:39.520]  maximum yield and he had one house that was clones and like between 12 and 20 houses running these
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:46.560]  1800 watts in the grow room um but yeah they're talking about this is the best weed i ever smoked
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:50.960]  i remember this so well i came out of this location blah blah blah blah and these organic folks and
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:56.160]  it's like man that shit was straight two-part freaking salt general hydroponic solution
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:06.960]  here's the thing though like it has to do with the way that light we interacted with that plant
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:10.480]  and the way those nutrients were interacting with that plant and the stresses that occurred
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:16.640]  like i think that has a lot to do with how there's multiple factors why we don't have skunk
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:22.000]  the way we had skunk right and i know people have skunk genetics still right and i have skunky
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:27.440]  genetics and i have i smell it i catch a waft of it every once in a while but then i drive by a
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:33.040]  dead skunk and it's like man we just don't have i don't have it i haven't seen it in a while
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:39.360]  there's someone's only recently tried the trinity og because it's got that piney skunk flavor to it
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:48.560]  um i will i i won't say that i've i've i know about the skunk but i do know about gh
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:54.240]  two-part from back in the day and i mean yeah everything was grown with that we grew
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:48:01.360]  we grew six star weed with gh hydro it would produce the trichomes pretty solid
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:05.200]  on there right i'm not advocating my brother so brother has
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:16.160]  bad i'm sorry um masters a dual masters from davis biochem enzymology which is the
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:23.680]  chemistry of wine and beer making right and we would get into these insane in-depth conversations
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:29.920]  because i mean he had the formula down and his his words are literally and i still say this
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:36.560]  is it's true the plant doesn't care where it gets its mpk right it just it's hungry and it wants to
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:42.560]  eat you know we all know that there's a whole nother thing going on now and we i try to explain
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:48.160]  it and we discuss this and we get into the depths of it but um i rarely see him anymore but when i
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:54.960]  do and i hand him some flour he smokes it he's like wow you grew this like it's organic right as
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:00.560]  uh but yeah he he's got a way better understanding of what's going on
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:09.200]  and i'm on some molecular level than i do right and uh i mean i would argue like certain terpenes
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:19.120]  do not transfer over as well or get like synthetically some things do just fine and you
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:25.040]  okay that's that's that's my so i have i've never grown under an led right
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:33.040]  neither like for the longest time i was doing everything indoors under a sodium and and uh
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:39.520]  high pressure sodium transition bulb even that's for the longest time and uh so it was a metal
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:48.080]  halide ballast with a specialty bulb so it was only like 970 right and um it's like genetics
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:53.680]  there's information there's there's the epigenetic response to those environments
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:50:01.120]  right and so stresses sometimes add into these different terpene responses and productions and
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:07.280]  so one of my theories about a lot of that skunk smell this there's a couple things cheese for
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:11.200]  instance it's very prevalent still and cheese is essentially skunk without the sulfur molecule
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:20.000]  and um so so i talk about how over the past 30 years we've had less and less sulfur in our diesel
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:25.840]  fuel and so we have less atmospheric available sulfur and it may be different from what as i'm
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:33.600]  feeding sulfur with with um soluble uh gypsum right i feed all sorts of sulfur to the plant
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:39.040]  but it's still i still get some skunky stuff and you know work work people in the next door man it
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:44.960]  smells like a skunk around here but i haven't had that skunk smell like i used to have since
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:52.560]  i did production indoor using um what was it that i used it wasn't it wasn't general it
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:59.360]  i think general hydroponics bought the company so people but it was
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:07.440]  it was the organic style of that well i haven't bought it 15 years i can't remember what the
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:15.120]  fuck it's called i'm an earth juice no it's not the earth juice um like i don't even have any empty
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:24.320]  cut out bottles for water um not the flora that's the two part it's the
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:31.520]  liquid karma was like the little specialty additive for a botanic
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:37.680]  that's the one that's the one so i would use botanic hair with a six inch pot with a top
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:44.160]  noodle drip and a recyclatory system with hid lights and i was getting up to three pound
[02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:51.520]  two and a half a light um seven pounds uh three thousand
[02:51:53.760 --> 02:51:59.680]  watts and just intensive back in the day um and
[02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:06.800]  animal control would drive around looking for the and i had massive carbon filters going they'd be
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:11.040]  driving around the neighborhood looking for the mystery skunk family right now i'm growing those
[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:17.840]  exact same genetics today and i cannot bring that smell out the same way right um i don't believe
[02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:24.400]  i've got the latent hop thyroid here because there's no i've only ever brought in one set of
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:30.000]  clones somebody handed me that came from the medical facility locally um so there's no i don't
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:35.840]  know how i get it here otherwise to have it change that genetic and so what are the what are the
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:42.960]  factors in the last 15 years since i was doing that production mode to today we have biodiesel
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:49.760]  in our in our diesel instead of the sulfur for the lubricant right i'm not using botanic air
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:54.160]  anymore and i'm also not using hid for my production system so you know there's there's a
[02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:59.760]  couple of different factors that go into those things but i got no idea how my stuff would grow
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:07.680]  under an led for instance right it can be completely different responses um could have
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:12.080]  been how i was using right up to the end the same thing my brother figured out back of the day it
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:20.080]  was mixing the blue and the red to get more of a sunlight or mimic daylight through the day with
[02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:25.360]  kicking on the 400 bringing on the thousand kick it on the second 400 for the intense light
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:31.200]  midday direct blue sun and then kicking off one kicking off the other and having your even
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:40.400]  you know less light yellow um yeah i mean i can say like i definitely have i've been using a
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:45.920]  ceramic metal halide lights i love them yeah i'm gonna say i love them they have a much wider
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:55.040]  spectrum i find that yeah it makes really nice bud that's very flavorful and the thing that i
[02:53:55.040 --> 02:54:02.480]  noticed the most is that the plants under a cmh light hardened off to the sun a lot easier
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:08.560]  um you know because that light was something i guess that they were used to it was closer to the
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:15.920]  sun like from veg to putting it outside or you finishing them off after like doing three five
[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:21.120]  weeks indoors and putting them out to finish in the sun um like vegging and then basically like
[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:27.120]  you would need to harden them off as as much gotcha gotcha yeah yeah and then even like here's
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:34.000]  um like i could have a denser leaf yeah and part of that has to do with that green spectrum that
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:38.560]  penetrates right through the cells and right on through the next leaf right and what's really
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:45.360]  interesting is um my homie huey jack who used to be on used to be on the show um i offered to
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:50.880]  revenge some plants for him outdoors and he grows under leds and so he had these plants that were
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:56.160]  fully flowered and i was like i'll revenge them you know put them outside they'll be fine
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:03.760]  no just roasted i'm so solar cooked and fried them huh and i put them in the shade at first
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:10.880]  it did not yeah yeah man you gotta you gotta like have two or three days of cloudy skies and
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:15.280]  put them in like a greenhouse even well maybe we know you're closer to the coast more humidity
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:21.200]  but yeah it's uh where i am here i have to look for those cloudy days to bring in from
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:27.520]  a fluorescent or a led to put them into the even the shade of the bottom of the greenhouse
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:33.760]  like it's intense but again yeah i agree coming out of a cmh when i use that for veg it transitions
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:39.600]  over much better to much more uh hardy plant you know his were like fully flowered like i was
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:44.160]  totally like gonna flip you know reverse them all the way back so i'd assume that they would have
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:50.800]  some something in them and it they turned i mean it looked like a vampire basically like it just
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:56:00.240]  turned them like pale and just it was yeah there's not enough there's not enough material to deal
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:05.920]  with the energy that's coming in and all of a sudden right yeah it just it's it's a whole different
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:18.400]  um what's a great analogy hey i don't know like gosh what is it i mean it's like sitting on the
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:22.720]  couch watching tv of people mountaineering and then you're actually going up on a mountain and
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:28.400]  trying to do it yourself yeah right i don't know the best analogy i can come up with
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:29.220]  yeah
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:35.760]  because i love watching those mountaineering shows too especially when i'm eating some food
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:43.440]  like with my like there's some uh a blanket over me so i'm warm right right right well well but i'm
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:53.840]  i'm i'm i'm for real uh that's that's november 1st uh 18 years ago that's my i made i made the
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:58.880]  photograph and the painting and that's my best friend hardcore that i talked about the hardcore
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:04.960]  genetic um and we went we went skiing but that's i've read that strain and honor him
[02:57:04.960 --> 02:57:12.560]  he died up on the side of the mountain and still up there but uh i've been we got 100 inches in the
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:17.440]  past freaking three weeks up at the mountain right and they're gonna open the ski resort two weeks
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:25.040]  early and uh i usually like go up and i'm up there hiking every freaking day and skiing and i've i
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:32.960]  haven't been for trying to get my fucking car fixed before i gotta go back to work in the snow right
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:39.440]  five days at the shop and they didn't even look at it i did i tried to get my trying to get wheels
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:43.440]  for my snow tires just so i can swap them out myself and not just have to get them transitioned
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:49.920]  to the same wheels all the time can't get anyone in it's like there's a line out the door at the
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:57.600]  tire shop nowhere to park yeah you do they call that iron man skiing where you hike up the hill
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:04.320]  and then ski down i've never heard it called that but like i did my 21st birthday i spent
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:10.560]  uh 10 days solo backcountry still solo mountaineering ski mountaineering and so i went
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:19.760]  from like lee vining california and up to twally meadows and yosemite and 120 pound pack on and um
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:26.320]  pair of skis that look like this these aren't the ones i used that day but um
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:32.480]  so they've just got that cross-country three pin binder on there but then back when i was doing
[02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:38.640]  that kind of stuff i would have a cable as well that would um attach to the back of the boot
[02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:45.600]  and then the bottom of the ski has got texture on i don't know if we can see the texture there we go
[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:50.320]  and so you can put skins it's like a shark skin that grabs the snow when you're going uphill
[02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:58.320]  or for less angle you can use that you can use different grip waxes too and um yeah i've done
[02:58:58.320 --> 02:59:04.720]  some other crazy stuff i was was a pro skier so there's a pro photographer taking pictures of me
[02:59:04.720 --> 02:59:12.960]  ski jumping and then i make oil painting of it and uh all sorts of but i love it on all sorts of
[02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:19.200]  levels like i'll go and watch the like the olympic jumpers and do the same thing right see if i can
[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:26.160]  get a decent so that's called evening trials up in park city and then there's part of the process
[02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:36.400]  right so photograph and i draw it out and then paint it um that's beautiful thanks thanks yeah
[02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:43.520]  well hey man i think i'm gonna i think it's time to wrap this up yeah yeah yeah we've we've
[02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:51.840]  diverged divulged away whatever there's a anyone before we go i'm gonna be getting back and
[02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:56.560]  hopefully getting more of these stone chillums made this winter and which are great tools for
[03:00:00.080 --> 03:00:06.560]  smoking that hash in so that heck yeah man let's have another one we could talk about chillums i
[03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:13.680]  got blessed two chillums from india nice they're super they're super awesome and i mean if anybody
[03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:18.640]  doesn't know like when you smoke out of a chillum it gets you really high you take a big deep hit
[03:00:19.360 --> 03:00:26.160]  you take a piece it's so high and like what it's crazy one quick chillum story before we go close
[03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:31.680]  it up i i was uh so my first wife from australia lived in greece and europe before she moved over
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:37.440]  to after she left australia came here and uh she brought me a chillum from from europe and so i was
[03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:42.720]  like one of the only people in 1990 to have a chillum in central california and nobody knew
[03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:49.200]  what they were um after i moved here and i went back to visit i was in in san luis obispo at a
[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:54.320]  house party in the country and met a couple of europeans and and they had a big old chillum
[03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:59.760]  they had some killer indica from norcal they showed me i'm like oh sweet real fun i've been
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:05.280]  living here and couldn't find nothing and um so they're like you gotta use a chill i'm like oh
[03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:10.160]  yeah i know how to chill i'm sure i'm gonna impress these guys and they pack it up and they
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:15.760]  wrap it with the cloth and hand it to me and i you know get the the position double-handed
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:22.160]  up to my mouth and they light it for me and i just when i was younger i used to smoke and i
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:28.160]  was able to smoke an entire cigarette and a single bong hit so i unbeknownst to me though and having
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:33.680]  had quit tobacco a couple years earlier they put a teeny bit of that bud in there and a whole punch
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:43.680]  of tobacco so yeah i turned green in the gills after taking the big monster hit
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:49.680]  man yeah that's kind of funny
