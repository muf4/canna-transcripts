[00:15.720 --> 00:18.160]  I could oh damn it. I hit the button again
[00:20.760 --> 00:22.760]  Over here
[00:22.800 --> 00:26.040]  How you doing tonight, mr. Toad I can hear you. Can you hear us good?
[00:26.840 --> 00:31.620]  Yeah, I can hear you I'm doing all right man I had some personal stuff had to deal with so I'm late
[00:35.640 --> 00:42.400]  Yeah, we're just getting the show rolling chilling with eclectic elegance in the background just BS and probably talking about all the things
[00:42.400 --> 00:44.400]  We should be talking about while we're on the air
[00:50.120 --> 00:53.320]  We'll see what happens maybe maybe a couple people will show up
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.800]  Holy crap, look everybody is in chat. They are here. They said it's time
[01:01.840 --> 01:03.840]  Fashionably
[01:03.960 --> 01:05.960]  Fashionably late, right?
[01:05.960 --> 01:07.960]  Usually blend on my hair, but
[01:10.080 --> 01:17.640]  So, yeah another another episode of volume 16 of the seed collectors Dave might be dropping in
[01:17.640 --> 01:22.320]  So we're gonna keep our fingers crossed for that one. He's got the link. He may be dropping in
[01:22.320 --> 01:29.800]  That is my fearless co-host the man who is like singed his fingertips more times than anybody. I know
[01:33.440 --> 01:38.760]  Stoked to have you guys on tonight because again the the seed collector show is where we kind of take out
[01:38.840 --> 01:43.360]  You know some of the new packs that we've gotten recently some of the things that we're really stoked about
[01:43.720 --> 01:48.760]  Maybe some of the things that we're growing next and it's been a while since the show
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.920]  So I do have a few things to go through with people but as you can see quickly from the outside
[01:54.920 --> 01:56.920]  we've got eclectic elegance and
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.760]  We've got
[01:59.760 --> 02:01.760]  DDA
[02:03.800 --> 02:05.800]  So
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.200]  Way to like go through and describe some of these strains and the lineage and where they come from then to talk with the actual
[02:13.680 --> 02:15.680]  so
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.480]  Yeah, big ups guys and thank you for joining us tonight
[02:20.880 --> 02:22.880]  Absolutely
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.320]  You know, mr. Toad, you're definitely a regular on the channel
[02:28.000 --> 02:28.920]  appear
[02:28.920 --> 02:32.080]  Do actually a lot of different places and do multiple different things
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.360]  But on the rare instance somebody is just tuning in for the first time
[02:36.360 --> 02:40.360]  Do you want to let everybody know kind of who you are and what you doing?
[02:41.200 --> 02:46.680]  Yes, sir, my name is mr. Toad, I'm brother bone filial feel I own
[02:48.200 --> 02:55.640]  Bone yards, he's North Cal. I've been doing this for man a long time. It's almost been 30 years that I've been breeding
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.400]  I've been messing with cannabis since I was 8 years old in 1981. I started growing cannabis learning how to clone
[03:03.360 --> 03:07.240]  it's the passion from with inside me that found through a
[03:08.240 --> 03:16.240]  Basically sick and dying loved ones man, and that's brought me to people like Lucas with the same kind of passion that are trying to
[03:16.240 --> 03:18.160]  Use this plant to help others
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.680]  He's the person I call it brother. I love that deed like like a brother man
[03:22.680 --> 03:30.080]  100% man ever since me and him met up in the PFA just jibber-jabber and shit and then turn that into a lifetime
[03:31.160 --> 03:35.040]  Friendship man, that's what this plants been all about man. So that's basically
[03:35.040 --> 03:37.040]  Absolutely
[03:37.080 --> 03:38.240]  Absolutely
[03:38.240 --> 03:45.960]  Really freaking cool because I didn't know that story at all and my brother bone your word is means a lot
[03:45.960 --> 03:47.000]  so
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  You have been a warrior for this plant and you you continue to be and you've helped more people than I know
[03:53.040 --> 03:55.680]  which is another reason why I love what you do, but
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.280]  To have such kind of strong words about Lucas down here as well
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.280]  That means a lot so Lucas dude, I knew you were a cool guy and I
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.880]  Conversations before but this goes another level. So please fill the world in man
[04:10.880 --> 04:17.040]  um, I mean like he said, you know, we kind of met on PFA on Facebook and then
[04:17.840 --> 04:19.840]  you know just
[04:19.960 --> 04:22.520]  babbled back and forth about cannabis and he
[04:23.240 --> 04:28.320]  Taught me so much and shortened my learning curve so much to
[04:28.720 --> 04:36.640]  The cannabis world, you know and I've been incredibly thankful in knowledge that he's been able to share with me and
[04:37.320 --> 04:42.120]  Genetics and just the awesome kind dude that he is like, you know
[04:42.120 --> 04:46.120]  it was awesome to go to the MLO Cup with him in 2014 and
[04:46.400 --> 04:53.160]  2015 with some of our other buddies and be able to have a killer weekend and get to meet a bunch of people from
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.520]  Facebook on
[04:54.520 --> 04:59.700]  At the event as well and then just hang out as homies and just become brothers, you know
[04:59.700 --> 05:03.080]  so we've always been very close friends since
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.380]  Man a long time ago. I feel like 20
[05:08.360 --> 05:10.160]  12 maybe
[05:10.160 --> 05:16.500]  2011 like it's been a long time like Tony and I have known each other for yeah at least a decade or more and
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.640]  Yeah, he's just been a big a big inspiration and a big
[05:22.640 --> 05:29.240]  Awesome friend to have for the last, you know decade and yeah, it's it's been awesome
[05:30.240 --> 05:31.400]  and
[05:31.400 --> 05:39.080]  Thankfully, you know, he he's been able to share knowledge and seemed with me like nobody else man. It's been amazing
[05:40.360 --> 05:43.440]  So yeah much love brother much much love
[05:44.200 --> 05:50.560]  That's really cool to me to hearing that, you know people on opposite coasts have been brought together by this plant
[05:50.920 --> 05:52.400]  No
[05:52.400 --> 05:56.160]  We're the same coasts. I'm from Cali. He's from NorCal. So
[05:57.400 --> 05:59.200]  Yeah, yeah
[05:59.200 --> 06:04.440]  Well, I feel less bad about starting at 7 o'clock or normal time for some reason
[06:04.440 --> 06:10.320]  I had you on the East Coast and I'm like, no, I'm I'm in Colorado. So I'm like General Mountain
[06:16.600 --> 06:18.600]  Yeah
[06:18.800 --> 06:20.400]  Well, yeah
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.480]  you know again talking about the just the the giving away gear and
[06:26.320 --> 06:28.320]  Helping people out
[06:28.880 --> 06:30.360]  You know, mr
[06:30.360 --> 06:38.000]  Toad has helped me tremendously help other people by stocking me up with with beans that I give out to people
[06:38.800 --> 06:42.440]  You know one of one of the important things and this is for everybody out there, too
[06:42.720 --> 06:46.800]  Because I get approached by a lot of people who are making seeds and that's good
[06:46.800 --> 06:53.120]  We want to get seeds into the hands of people because we want more people to grow we want people to get their medicine
[06:53.640 --> 06:55.640]  exactly that said
[06:57.160 --> 07:00.220]  You know when you're giving seeds to somebody who you know
[07:00.220 --> 07:05.800]  Maybe sick and they can only plant four we want four of them to be good
[07:05.800 --> 07:09.640]  We don't want what ifs we don't kind of want some of these oddities
[07:09.640 --> 07:14.160]  So that's why you know people will approach me and I'll be like cool. Do you have any grows?
[07:14.160 --> 07:18.640]  You know, can you show where this has been grown out? Do you have like a history of it?
[07:19.680 --> 07:25.440]  and so that's something that I encourage for people because there's a lot of awesome people that want to help other people and that right
[07:25.440 --> 07:28.680]  There is the way document the grows give people
[07:30.480 --> 07:35.240]  Something that they can look in on to just gain confidence. That's something that I have to do
[07:35.240 --> 07:40.780]  That's something that I'm currently doing. That's something that other growers are doing and that's something that you know, mr
[07:40.780 --> 07:42.780]  Bone has been doing for a long ass time
[07:43.500 --> 07:47.540]  Not hard to find one of his grows and that's why I always feel confident
[07:48.460 --> 07:50.460]  Giving one of his packs to somebody
[07:51.380 --> 07:54.100]  Because I'm like it's going to be good
[07:54.100 --> 07:59.780]  There's no what if and or butts so I guess I could kind of just skip, you know, sorry Tony
[07:59.780 --> 08:01.780]  I'll pull out here for a second, but
[08:03.700 --> 08:04.820]  It's just truth
[08:04.820 --> 08:08.580]  But I guess I want to I want to start with this pack because this is something new
[08:09.140 --> 08:13.860]  That you had sent me that you may have worked on now it's got one of the stations. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[08:14.620 --> 08:18.620]  That's a collab between me and Dutch blooms Dutch had sent me some plants last year
[08:18.740 --> 08:25.580]  He sent me the shesh money cuddler the Catholic school girl the black walk gold black walk fruit and pie
[08:25.580 --> 08:28.820]  Ho, I did everything but pie. Oh I did
[08:30.660 --> 08:33.300]  It crossed with my space cheese mail and
[08:34.060 --> 08:41.740]  So far everyone that's ran those things love a man there a lot of color coming out of there lots of terpenes coming out and
[08:42.980 --> 08:50.260]  Real loud flavors people been loving them. They've been mostly between nine and ten weeks on most of the selections coming out of there. I
[08:52.180 --> 08:56.900]  Like that one myself to she's a good producer a lot of color will come out of her she's a beautiful plan
[08:57.540 --> 09:04.020]  Because I've run I've run one of your space cheese crosses before it was the the RKS time space cheese was a
[09:04.420 --> 09:06.660]  Awesome plant looked pretty smelled good
[09:07.580 --> 09:13.260]  Unfortunately, that was one of the plants that got lost to the 30 days in Amsterdam
[09:14.220 --> 09:16.060]  the plant sitter let the
[09:16.060 --> 09:21.820]  Okay, so I thought I would be smart and just take a whole bunch of clones in case something happened to the plants
[09:22.820 --> 09:24.820]  they forgot to put water in my
[09:25.380 --> 09:27.380]  Clone machine so it ran dry
[09:28.580 --> 09:31.620]  The pump was dead by the time I got home and that
[09:32.060 --> 09:38.980]  Fortunately was one that I lost but I have seen some space cheese crosses and I was happy one thing I've noticed
[09:39.340 --> 09:42.260]  And I saw some other people get is I saw some pink
[09:43.020 --> 09:50.020]  Stigmas. Yeah, is that something where it comes from my space coach line. So my space coach is a
[09:50.820 --> 09:52.820]  Famous for here. I'll bring up a picture
[09:53.300 --> 09:59.580]  It it's known for throwing pink between week three and five all the time and I when I say pink
[09:59.580 --> 10:01.780]  I mean like as pink as you can get pink and
[10:02.420 --> 10:04.760]  That a space coach line the angel male
[10:05.180 --> 10:10.980]  From that line is the father to space cheese. And so the pink that you see popping out of that is coming from
[10:11.780 --> 10:15.500]  The space coach line. So let me see here. I got a couple pictures
[10:16.140 --> 10:23.700]  Yeah, got Tim out here he's I put space utopia my outdoor pot three days three days ago super excited nice
[10:25.060 --> 10:30.240]  Big ups for that. So here's a here's a space cheese female if I can get it to load
[10:31.780 --> 10:38.740]  My phone's slow here. Yeah, no worries technology. It's gonna keep sucking until AI takes us over. Oh
[10:40.060 --> 10:42.060]  Nice. Yeah
[10:43.060 --> 10:50.180]  Pretty man, that's pretty that's not so that's like that's like pinkleberry kush status like
[10:53.620 --> 10:58.460]  And I've been like that's from like I made space cushion 2005
[10:59.460 --> 11:03.540]  I've been throwing pink for a long time. It was something that I was always like, why are you breeding?
[11:03.540 --> 11:07.980]  Like who would want to breed for pink? I know it's pretty and all but like unless the weeds good
[11:07.980 --> 11:10.260]  I don't care what it looks like visually
[11:11.060 --> 11:13.740]  Gotta be effective on a medicinal side
[11:13.740 --> 11:19.740]  Not just mine altering highs because I can find that a lot of shit, but I breed for medicine to medicine
[11:19.740 --> 11:24.020]  I mean before I got sick and became one of the people that needed that true medicine
[11:24.020 --> 11:30.340]  I was using a large base of sick folks to really dig through my lines. Not just saying it
[11:30.340 --> 11:34.260]  That's what I was doing and I found out that there are certain lines
[11:35.020 --> 11:38.660]  And my space cushion one of them that was a plant that when smoked
[11:39.500 --> 11:43.780]  Felt like medicine like with my mom used to smoke that shit with the skaters that she'd known
[11:43.780 --> 11:47.460]  She's my mom had been taking my nephew to skate park since he was fucking four years old
[11:47.620 --> 11:51.460]  and by the time he's 23 like she knew kids like
[11:51.780 --> 11:56.960]  They were her grandkids or I can bed started smoking and eventually when they're in their 20s
[11:56.960 --> 12:03.260]  They'd come smoke with her when they're around her and they you know skaters fucking legs are killing them. The knees fucking hurt
[12:03.260 --> 12:06.540]  they don't notice it when they're young until they slow down for a second and
[12:07.180 --> 12:09.180]  They'd come over and take
[12:10.220 --> 12:14.260]  They'd skate away and then come back and be like what the fuck was that like that shit made me feel good
[12:14.660 --> 12:18.060]  like on every level anyone that smoked that knew that plant had a
[12:18.580 --> 12:21.340]  medical power and that's why I used it for breathing because of
[12:22.020 --> 12:27.060]  What it did for my mom like she made me make some lines for her that combined
[12:27.500 --> 12:32.060]  Different cultivars that she was smoking separately and there's something that we could grow from seed all the time
[12:32.060 --> 12:35.380]  And that's what I was doing. That's what I made that line for
[12:35.540 --> 12:39.320]  So then I use that like I made over 200 crosses with that male
[12:39.580 --> 12:43.660]  Yeah, I use that thing to find out what he could do what he possessed
[12:44.300 --> 12:48.060]  What he would offer and breeding and that's why when I came back and got sick
[12:48.060 --> 12:54.320]  I went back into my space cheese line, which was related to the angel mail something that Lucas himself has tried up at the
[12:54.840 --> 12:59.500]  At the Emerald Cove so I could tell you about what it tasted like and what it smelled like
[12:59.700 --> 13:04.460]  It's better for someone else that had no passion into that plan to tell you whether or not it was
[13:07.860 --> 13:15.740]  I'll tell you what that cheese that he used in there like you want to talk about the most like
[13:17.020 --> 13:18.660]  exotic
[13:18.660 --> 13:24.420]  Funky expensive cheese you could think of and it has that nasty from under cheese
[13:24.820 --> 13:30.780]  Fun like yeah, I was like dude like I've smelled a bunch of cheeses like
[13:31.220 --> 13:33.500]  Going around LA like when I live in Cali
[13:33.500 --> 13:39.020]  It's a thing to do on the weekends when I would get my weekend was like to go down to you know
[13:39.020 --> 13:42.300]  Usually San Diego or anywhere anywhere along the coast
[13:42.940 --> 13:48.020]  Go enjoy the beach and hit a bunch of hot shops and find you know
[13:48.380 --> 13:50.380]  Good
[13:57.700 --> 13:59.700]  I
[14:12.500 --> 14:16.020]  Could just blindfold people and just have them smelling
[14:16.740 --> 14:21.940]  Expensive cheese and then you throw that bag of weed in there and they would not be able to tell the difference and be like
[14:21.940 --> 14:24.580]  Yeah, that's so-and-so cheese. It was
[14:25.100 --> 14:31.900]  The only cheese I've actually smelled that was like wow, this is weed, but it smells you know
[14:33.100 --> 14:35.860]  Incredibly nasty cheesy. Yes, it was
[14:36.580 --> 14:38.860]  Incredible definitely incredible
[14:39.420 --> 14:41.740]  It's a memorable smell when you get it
[14:41.740 --> 14:47.220]  And yeah, like the sign to me of something being rank and this one definitely would fit in there
[14:47.540 --> 14:50.300]  Yeah, cuz when you go to take it here when you go to
[14:50.980 --> 14:57.100]  You know inhale through your nose and you like throttle your rate of inhalation like halfway through your whoa
[15:04.820 --> 15:06.820]  Yeah, yeah
[15:07.100 --> 15:09.100]  Yeah
[15:09.140 --> 15:12.820]  You know kind of kind of speaking of funky before I turn it over to you guys
[15:12.820 --> 15:15.980]  I would you know, I just wanted to hit at least one strain from each of you guys. So
[15:16.500 --> 15:19.900]  Eclectic elegance here. I've got this one growing right now
[15:19.900 --> 15:26.900]  I actually just popped these the other day and garlic meat saute does not sound like roses
[15:28.460 --> 15:34.180]  Actually, you know one thing I do like about the pack and this is honestly why I picked this one first to grow
[15:34.340 --> 15:40.860]  Your description, you know short dense nodes expect the plants to respond find the topping of the filming
[15:41.660 --> 15:44.420]  flowering time 55 to 65 days that
[15:45.060 --> 15:50.020]  Fits my profile right now short compact 55 65 days
[15:50.340 --> 15:55.180]  So plus plus the flavor profile on there. Yeah, dude
[15:55.500 --> 15:59.280]  But but what can you tell me about the the garlic meat saute?
[15:59.880 --> 16:05.800]  So I can tell you that the a the parents to them are just nasty
[16:06.920 --> 16:13.840]  The garlic the garlic sherbert. So here's the story behind garlic sherbet. It's obviously comes from
[16:15.080 --> 16:23.200]  How I can I think that in-house genetics? So a local dispensary here in Steamboat Springs grew a pack of
[16:24.080 --> 16:29.480]  In-house genetics garlic sherbet and they found a specific female that came out incredible and
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.640]  the head grower actually had the cut back to
[16:36.120 --> 16:43.020]  Have breeder of in-house and that's what he used for his new garlic sherbet line was the billow cup
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.320]  Okay, I had a buddy that worked at billow that was getting me
[16:48.040 --> 16:51.560]  Ounces of the garlic sugar for his employee price
[16:51.560 --> 16:56.840]  so out of like six ounces of garlic sugar I had found three seeds and
[16:57.640 --> 17:03.880]  out of the three seeds one of them talks and that turned out to be the garlic sherbet that I and
[17:04.360 --> 17:06.280]  That one. Oh my lord
[17:06.280 --> 17:08.280]  Like I'm not trying to toot my own horn
[17:08.400 --> 17:15.640]  But the terpenes like the garlic sherbet doesn't look as good as the phenol that billow has
[17:15.640 --> 17:17.840]  But the terpenes on it are
[17:18.760 --> 17:20.760]  far more superior
[17:21.480 --> 17:25.000]  and I mean the the high from it is
[17:25.920 --> 17:27.320]  incredible like
[17:27.320 --> 17:29.320]  this last hunting season
[17:29.960 --> 17:36.820]  My dad and I actually met up with a hunter from Pennsylvania and I had smoked him out with some
[17:37.520 --> 17:42.440]  And he went back to apparently we met up with him next time. He went drove back to his
[17:43.040 --> 17:49.040]  Camp, you know just like a couple campsites down. He's like, dude. I had a straight
[17:49.920 --> 17:57.080]  psychedelic like almost mushroom experience like what the fuck was that and I was like
[18:01.560 --> 18:05.280]  And it's always just been incredibly strong
[18:06.280 --> 18:08.200]  and so
[18:08.200 --> 18:10.120]  yeah, like I
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.320]  Have I still have that cut around? I love it's a personal favorite
[18:17.320 --> 18:20.560]  Favorites I have my personal favorites to of the stable so
[18:22.640 --> 18:25.320]  I'll tell you what, dude. I'll go through
[18:27.200 --> 18:32.720]  95% of the seeds and only keep those one or two or three plants that are the absolute top of the top
[18:32.800 --> 18:37.160]  Everything else goes in the trash like if it's not the best of the best that's going in the trash
[18:37.160 --> 18:44.240]  So if I keep it and I've been running it it's because it's best of the best like I have an OG
[18:44.920 --> 18:49.060]  See that's been throwing clone only zone to the bus. So
[18:51.880 --> 18:54.160]  So anyways as I digress the
[18:55.200 --> 19:02.360]  The mail that I used from that I had grown blue power from since city genetics. They actually don't see from
[19:03.200 --> 19:04.800]  Yeah, bro
[19:04.800 --> 19:08.840]  So I had grown the F cheese's I bought four packs and
[19:09.800 --> 19:14.080]  Ran through those and I found a really heavy
[19:14.960 --> 19:22.320]  Master Kush mail and then a very heavy sour diesel like power number one mix
[19:22.600 --> 19:24.280]  female it was
[19:24.280 --> 19:27.440]  Divine absolutely divine super gassy
[19:28.600 --> 19:30.600]  blueberry muffin profiler
[19:31.240 --> 19:37.240]  Incredible absolutely in the heart like oh you want to talk about TKO just knock you out. No
[19:38.320 --> 19:45.560]  Dude that blue power and then it's an incredible extractor the bag the bag appeal on it is
[19:46.440 --> 19:48.440]  Phenomenal just straight sugar-coated
[19:49.560 --> 19:57.680]  So anyways, I had done my f3 with that specific master Kush mail and that keeper female
[19:58.640 --> 20:04.440]  It wasn't you know a huge open selection and it you know, yeah, it's only two male and female
[20:05.080 --> 20:08.680]  But that's those are the two plants I use for the f3 blue powers
[20:08.720 --> 20:15.840]  so then I popped some f3s of the blue powers and I have found a male that had
[20:16.360 --> 20:21.320]  Looked and smelled exactly like that female that blueberry gaspino
[20:21.320 --> 20:26.960]  And so I had yeah, cuz I popped through like 25 of them. I want to say
[20:28.560 --> 20:32.160]  The females I found female similar, but she wasn't quite
[20:32.680 --> 20:36.800]  the mom but the milk like the leaf pattern and
[20:37.200 --> 20:43.000]  Structure of that specific female that I had those like I have pictures of it and you could be like, yep
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.680]  That's her, you know
[20:44.680 --> 20:51.360]  And so I have found a male that I was like, whoa, that's that's that's her but it's him, you know
[20:51.720 --> 20:55.520]  so I kept mail the pollen from him and
[20:56.040 --> 20:58.040]  I had done
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.160]  Actually, no, I just collected pollen from him. I didn't pollinate anything else at the time
[21:04.040 --> 21:10.880]  But I had saved pollen in the freezer, obviously and garlic sherbet was one of the ones that I was like, yeah
[21:10.880 --> 21:13.840]  I think these two together would be just
[21:15.040 --> 21:18.840]  Something special, you know, and so I did it and
[21:20.160 --> 21:22.480]  I've gotten I have one
[21:23.360 --> 21:28.240]  Tester that has one that's about three weeks in man, and they're just
[21:28.840 --> 21:31.200]  That they're they're just gonna be like these
[21:32.040 --> 21:39.640]  Amazing little cola bushes. It's like if you top them really young at that five node point when they're you know seedlings
[21:39.640 --> 21:44.240]  And then let them do another three or four and do it again and do it again and do it again
[21:44.240 --> 21:46.240]  And I like femming
[21:46.360 --> 21:53.680]  Personally over topping because I feel like a lot of times I can get four nodes at about that same spot
[21:53.880 --> 21:58.240]  instead of like two and two and two, um, and so I
[21:59.080 --> 22:01.080]  Same with the Swahili sweets
[22:01.640 --> 22:05.920]  That things like an og KB seed form, you know
[22:05.920 --> 22:09.540]  And that's just from everyone that I've gotten reports back
[22:09.540 --> 22:14.640]  It's just straight stacking cola bushes and however why you can get that bush
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.760]  You just focus on that top 10 inches of growth and it's a straight call off so
[22:21.960 --> 22:29.400]  Yeah, I the garlic sherbet should be I don't know if it'll be quite as thick as the Swahili
[22:29.600 --> 22:33.140]  But you're definitely gonna get extremely dense
[22:35.160 --> 22:37.480]  Nugs and I mean they're gonna stack hard
[22:39.040 --> 22:40.640]  And they're gonna be
[22:40.640 --> 22:44.200]  Incredible washers. I haven't pressed any of that one
[22:44.200 --> 22:49.320]  So when I when I grow some I'm very excited to press some of that into Ross and
[22:50.160 --> 22:54.080]  personally and the terpene profiles on that one
[22:55.320 --> 22:56.440]  my
[22:56.440 --> 23:03.080]  Couple of my testers, you know hit me with some veg smells but between the garlic sherbet
[23:03.320 --> 23:10.520]  Which is an incredible mix. It's not overdone by the GMO. It's a nice mix of the blue sherbet
[23:10.640 --> 23:12.840]  I believe it is it is a
[23:14.680 --> 23:21.320]  Phenomenal profile. I kind of I can go grab a jar and smell it but I
[23:22.760 --> 23:29.240]  One of those ones that's like complex and it's like as much as I'm like, it's a little this little bit
[23:29.240 --> 23:32.400]  It's like a little gassy a little asphalt
[23:32.400 --> 23:38.040]  He a little sweet and a little G and just it's hard to be like, yeah, this is what it is
[23:38.560 --> 23:40.560]  But but that
[23:41.680 --> 23:45.440]  Combined with the blueberry muffin gas of the blue
[23:46.080 --> 23:48.080]  power f3
[23:48.240 --> 23:51.960]  Shit should be out of this world. Um, yeah
[23:51.960 --> 23:58.440]  it's a line that I'm extremely excited about and I unfortunately think a lot of people have been sleeping on it because
[23:58.960 --> 24:01.520]  Not a whole lot of seeds have been sold of it
[24:02.040 --> 24:06.320]  I had a few testers that were interested in it and I'm just you know
[24:06.880 --> 24:11.320]  Kind of waiting for them to like cut some down and smoke it and be like
[24:12.520 --> 24:18.520]  That's the thing, you know again like the the garlic meat saute. I've got them growing right now
[24:18.520 --> 24:23.720]  They're about this high. They were the first to crack. They were the first to break the soil
[24:24.040 --> 24:29.800]  So I'm excited but it is it's kind of funny how that works out. Sometimes it's like you put something out
[24:29.800 --> 24:32.840]  That's like you've grown it, you know, it's fire your friends like it
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.920]  But it takes about four or five months and then people you're like
[24:36.920 --> 24:38.520]  Why does people care all this up?
[24:38.520 --> 24:44.960]  Well, the grow reports are coming out people have seen it grown and they're like, holy shit. I need some of that. So
[24:46.400 --> 24:51.600]  You can still find it and well you can and it's one of my cheaper ones
[24:51.600 --> 24:56.040]  I'm like, you know, I know the genetics on it are absolutely fire
[24:56.040 --> 25:00.000]  But because it's not related to black lime reserve or this that and the other
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.360]  You know people are probably gonna sleep on it so I made it a little bit more affordable
[25:05.360 --> 25:08.720]  So hopefully people like, you know, let me try that one, you know
[25:08.720 --> 25:16.840]  So I I try to keep all my genetics affordable, but I also try to not devalue genetics like black limes are you know?
[25:16.840 --> 25:17.840]  so
[25:17.840 --> 25:19.840]  Yeah, so I definitely
[25:20.240 --> 25:22.240]  Yeah, I try to have a good
[25:22.960 --> 25:25.400]  Good diversity is what I is my goal
[25:25.560 --> 25:32.200]  That's an awesome point he brought up right where he says Kevin black lime reserve and his a breeding, right?
[25:32.200 --> 25:36.040]  I was with Lucas when he picked up the seeds of that. I also got some I
[25:36.600 --> 25:38.600]  Picked up both our pets. Yes
[25:39.640 --> 25:44.320]  And um, yeah, you know gene gene is
[25:45.080 --> 25:47.640]  He's a great breeder man. That dudes a wealth of knowledge
[25:48.680 --> 25:54.040]  the amount of information and the amount of breeding he's done to put into that line and then when he offers
[25:54.040 --> 25:58.680]  The community for what they did for someone to come in and get that from
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.040]  Gene and then either make an f2 or an f3 or wherever it is
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.720]  And then decide to like a charge one-third the price that gene was it's just the way to like totally be
[26:09.960 --> 26:13.880]  Disrespectful to someone who put so much time into it and when Lucas brings that up
[26:13.880 --> 26:19.320]  It's a great point to let people know that sometimes you got to practice either because it may be more than the others
[26:19.320 --> 26:21.560]  and it's not just because it's
[26:21.560 --> 26:24.520]  But it has to go back to the amount of time and respect
[26:25.080 --> 26:28.120]  that you can put on to one of your mentors and shit because
[26:28.680 --> 26:30.760]  Like I don't know how this feels about gene
[26:30.760 --> 26:34.620]  But like i've known gene through facebook also since like 2011
[26:35.160 --> 26:37.160]  And me and him used to talk and shit
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.920]  In groups and he was a cat that I took as like a mentor
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.400]  With knowledge of the plan if someone doesn't have to be older than you to be your mentor
[26:45.960 --> 26:53.320]  If someone doesn't have to be older than you to be your mentor if they know something more about a subject that you're into and
[26:54.120 --> 26:56.360]  You give them the amount of time and perspective
[26:56.440 --> 26:58.040]  You'll be able to find out that
[26:58.040 --> 27:02.760]  You can learn from anybody in this gene was one of the cats that I learned a lot from in the early days when it
[27:02.760 --> 27:05.320]  came to genetics breeding and stuff and
[27:06.520 --> 27:11.400]  I did the same thing with work like I got gear from gene and I didn't go and put it into my line
[27:11.400 --> 27:14.360]  So I could get paid like I made some seeds for my own self
[27:14.760 --> 27:17.480]  And that's as far as I went for me because I didn't want to try
[27:18.040 --> 27:19.720]  to use uh
[27:19.720 --> 27:22.440]  The cups that gene was putting in and winning
[27:23.160 --> 27:28.440]  As a way for me to jumpstart my own shit. I've been doing this for like like lucas says for years
[27:28.520 --> 27:31.960]  I've been i'd rather fall back on what i've already done myself
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.040]  And the information I have and use my own failures and successes to judge whether or not I can make it
[27:38.360 --> 27:42.120]  Try to just jack someone else and that's something that I find very respectful
[27:42.840 --> 27:44.840]  Is the way he read?
[27:44.920 --> 27:50.360]  He he didn't just take everybody's shit that he knew because he knew a lot of us have been doing this before
[27:50.680 --> 27:55.080]  Me and him had a talk in 2014 when we all rented a house and i'm like man
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.960]  You're in the same spot. I was at one time and I always dreamed of doing stuff and i'm like you just got to do
[27:59.960 --> 28:01.640]  It brother you've got it in you
[28:01.640 --> 28:03.640]  Do it and do it your own way
[28:03.640 --> 28:08.520]  Don't go doing it everyone else's way like i'm doing the way I do it gene does it the way he does it like
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  Use the guys that you believe in
[28:11.480 --> 28:14.280]  And their friendships to select through their seeds and stuff
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.680]  But like if you do it the right way, you're gonna succeed and that's why he's still here today
[28:18.840 --> 28:24.520]  Right and that's just because he took everybody's gear and made copies which there's gangs of dudes doing that already
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.280]  He went and went his own way and showed people what he was doing and he's proud of his own
[28:30.920 --> 28:36.040]  Collection and what he offers man, and he's got some fire in there i've grown it i've got a ton of his packs
[28:36.600 --> 28:37.800]  I mean
[28:37.800 --> 28:45.320]  He's someone that for real even though he's my friend. I've supported his breeding because he knows what he's doing. There's a passion in it
[28:46.520 --> 28:53.720]  And and all that you mentioned there too is you know people with what I like to say is the long game perspective. It's like
[28:54.440 --> 29:00.920]  Working on something takes time finding things that you want to continue to work with takes time
[29:01.480 --> 29:07.560]  Um not ripping off somebody else's work and turning it using it to create something new takes time
[29:07.960 --> 29:09.800]  So those people
[29:09.800 --> 29:14.120]  Have like the long game in mind and those are the people that I tend to gravitate to as well
[29:14.200 --> 29:17.160]  Because I I said this a million times. It's like these are things I would do
[29:17.560 --> 29:22.840]  Even if nobody was looking like this is just passion. This is this is what we want to do. Yeah
[29:23.720 --> 29:26.920]  For you guys to embody that as well is pretty powerful
[29:28.040 --> 29:30.040]  Yeah, I mean on and I
[29:30.840 --> 29:34.440]  Here's my little two cents about blr is like yes, I
[29:35.480 --> 29:39.800]  The line I stood in to get that pack for me and tony was
[29:40.500 --> 29:42.920]  Incredibly long and took a while to get through
[29:43.480 --> 29:45.480]  and it was
[29:46.120 --> 29:52.600]  It was a honor to be able to even you know receive one of the 250 packs released publicly
[29:53.080 --> 29:56.360]  And then on top of that it won second place
[29:57.080 --> 30:03.480]  I mean there was 1200 entries like 400 of them got just uh disqualified because of
[30:03.960 --> 30:08.760]  Uh testing and then out of what was left it had won second place
[30:09.240 --> 30:14.840]  And so I was like wow the entries and then I got to you know, smell some of it
[30:14.920 --> 30:17.640]  I got to smoke some of the black line got to you know
[30:18.600 --> 30:23.880]  Get a little bit of everything but then when I grew the seeds and I was like, whoa, dude
[30:23.960 --> 30:29.080]  This has been like one of my all-time favorite cultivars to like smoke
[30:29.560 --> 30:34.520]  I love how it grows like I just fell in love with it. And so that's when I asked
[30:34.920 --> 30:37.000]  Um mean gene. I was like, yo, dude, like
[30:38.040 --> 30:40.040]  Would you mind if I made up tunes?
[30:40.600 --> 30:41.800]  and
[30:41.800 --> 30:47.800]  He's like absolutely no like dude you you bought them like they're totally yours and so I did
[30:48.440 --> 30:53.720]  And then I posted pictures and stuff on facebook and then I got a bunch of interest on them
[30:53.720 --> 31:00.680]  And then I was like, hey, dude, like i've been getting a lot of interest like i'm not trying to like knock off to seeds or anything
[31:00.760 --> 31:05.480]  But would you be okay if I sold some and he's like absolutely once again, dude, like they're yours
[31:05.640 --> 31:09.800]  You bought them you made them you put in the work like you do you with them, you know
[31:10.040 --> 31:14.680]  And i've been very appreciative of that and i've always you know
[31:15.800 --> 31:23.640]  Done try to done do the ethical thing of making sure that I it's okay to do something with someone else's genetics
[31:23.720 --> 31:25.720]  Before I just go and do it, you know
[31:26.040 --> 31:27.480]  and so
[31:27.480 --> 31:29.240]  Yeah, thankfully
[31:29.240 --> 31:30.440]  you know
[31:30.440 --> 31:35.320]  because of black lime reserve being one of my all-time favorite cultivars I was like this is
[31:36.200 --> 31:38.680]  This is what I would love to like make
[31:39.160 --> 31:46.680]  Stuff that I would like to share, you know with the world and so that was when I kind of chose the two males
[31:47.320 --> 31:51.320]  Uh out of three so my pack ended up only having nine seats
[31:51.960 --> 31:52.920]  um
[31:52.920 --> 31:57.320]  And then out of the nine, uh, I got rid of one male
[31:58.360 --> 32:03.820]  Uh kept two of the keeper males. I got rid of one female because she herned
[32:04.540 --> 32:10.160]  And then I kept the rest to kind of keep you know an open line and do an open pollination
[32:10.540 --> 32:15.660]  But kind of get rid of any unwanted genetics or you know traits out of there
[32:16.220 --> 32:18.880]  And so that's what I ended up with the f2s
[32:19.900 --> 32:25.500]  uh, I made probably about 10 000 f2s i've you know sold through those and
[32:26.940 --> 32:28.940]  Grown out some and whatnot, but
[32:29.420 --> 32:31.100]  I recently
[32:31.100 --> 32:35.120]  Went and did 100 being phenol of the f2s
[32:36.060 --> 32:40.860]  And even with them being on a little bit older side, they're about
[32:41.820 --> 32:43.900]  six years old I got
[32:45.160 --> 32:47.580]  98 germination rate out of 100
[32:48.220 --> 32:53.660]  All right. Let me let me stop you there then because this is always the immediate question is
[32:55.020 --> 32:57.020]  Um, how were they stored?
[32:57.820 --> 33:05.980]  You know, I like to keep them stored in a ziploc bag with a bag of desiccant in a mason jar with another bag of
[33:06.200 --> 33:12.940]  Desiccant in a suitcase under the house that never gets above 50 degrees and it stays below
[33:13.960 --> 33:15.080]  probably
[33:15.080 --> 33:16.460]  30
[33:16.460 --> 33:17.820]  in the winter
[33:17.820 --> 33:18.780]  so
[33:18.780 --> 33:20.380]  It does have
[33:20.380 --> 33:24.140]  A little temp fluctuation. I don't have it in a fridge
[33:24.380 --> 33:28.460]  I have them in jars in a cool dark place under the house
[33:28.940 --> 33:32.940]  Anytime I go through seeds i'm under the house selecting through seeds like
[33:33.740 --> 33:35.740]  you know, I like I
[33:35.980 --> 33:39.180]  I saw mean gene post at one time like, you know in the
[33:39.660 --> 33:45.260]  I think in the early spring when it still like gets relatively freezing in the morning
[33:45.260 --> 33:48.620]  That's when he likes to bring out his seeds and select through them
[33:49.020 --> 33:55.260]  So there's not much temperature change like the the biggest thing about like and especially pollen
[33:55.420 --> 34:03.580]  I've had pollen store up to five years old and still get over 50 percent viability rates off of it. Yeah, I suck at pollen
[34:06.780 --> 34:09.820]  I've fucked I dude i've made so much pollen mold. I've
[34:10.620 --> 34:11.500]  The
[34:11.500 --> 34:14.940]  One way i've come to where I am is by fucking up
[34:15.340 --> 34:22.380]  Learning and talking to people like tony and mean gene and being like yo, dude. This is what happened. Where'd I go wrong?
[34:22.620 --> 34:24.620]  What do I need to do to improve?
[34:24.700 --> 34:26.060]  and so
[34:26.060 --> 34:28.060]  with with that's been
[34:28.680 --> 34:30.440]  absolutely like
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.860]  Priceless for me and my learning curve and growing and doing and breathing
[34:35.660 --> 34:37.340]  um, so
[34:37.340 --> 34:44.220]  Yeah, uh it I had incredible germination rates with seed stock that was six years old, you know
[34:44.940 --> 34:47.660]  So but that's that's me
[34:48.280 --> 34:50.460]  Storing it the way I store, you know
[34:51.180 --> 34:57.820]  Um all these people i've seen that have these, you know, elaborate little seed banks and like a seed card
[34:58.380 --> 35:00.380]  or like a a
[35:00.380 --> 35:05.900]  Baseball card collection and they just got it in their closet and it's 60 80 degree
[35:05.900 --> 35:09.820]  I'm like dude, those seeds are good for three four years and you're done like
[35:10.540 --> 35:12.540]  you know, so, uh
[35:12.860 --> 35:16.300]  yeah due to the fact how I store my seed stock is
[35:16.680 --> 35:22.380]  Definitely how I can get longevity out of it on top of the fact of just certain little
[35:23.500 --> 35:24.860]  um
[35:24.860 --> 35:30.540]  Tips I kind of do or things I do for germinating seed if it is older, you know
[35:31.340 --> 35:34.220]  Throw in some micro eyes a little bit of like
[35:34.700 --> 35:37.020]  Uh some gypsum or some kelp, you know
[35:37.020 --> 35:43.260]  Just tiny micro nutrients in there that the seed loses over time that helps it come back again
[35:43.660 --> 35:49.100]  um, and i'm talking about you wet your fingertip you barely dip it and you barely dip it some like
[35:49.660 --> 35:52.380]  So minute, but it helps. Um
[35:53.180 --> 35:59.980]  But anyways, I just did my blacklining reserve f3 open pollination with that seed stock
[36:00.460 --> 36:07.740]  And I selected from the 98 plants down to 17 females and six males
[36:08.620 --> 36:10.380]  and
[36:10.380 --> 36:15.740]  What I came to dub that line was the sour lime pine line
[36:16.700 --> 36:21.340]  Um due to the simple fact that like dude when I was collecting pollen from these males
[36:22.060 --> 36:25.100]  Like it smelled like straight lime zest
[36:25.820 --> 36:32.380]  In like a fresh cut lumber yard on a cool moist day you're just like
[36:33.340 --> 36:34.220]  Wow
[36:34.220 --> 36:42.540]  What is going on here? And then you know, you'd smell the females and my wife, uh is super super
[36:43.180 --> 36:48.140]  Sensitive to smells because she has an autoimmune condition. And so a lot of times i'll be like
[36:48.700 --> 36:51.100]  I can't I don't know exactly like what is this?
[36:51.500 --> 36:56.620]  She'll be like, oh that's you know a little this and a little that and so she helps me a lot
[36:57.420 --> 37:00.780]  Hey, ma'am, can you calm down? Sorry my dog's
[37:03.100 --> 37:04.140]  Um
[37:04.140 --> 37:11.580]  and so, uh, yeah, she helps me a lot with kind of describing my uh lines on some of my
[37:12.200 --> 37:13.260]  profiles
[37:13.260 --> 37:18.940]  Which is good. It's it's nice to have that and you know, I kind of have like i'm a little bit
[37:19.420 --> 37:26.380]  Nosedepth so I don't smell the best but when I get something that I smell or like I open a jar and I smell it
[37:27.100 --> 37:30.860]  That's the winner and my wife too. She's like, oh my god. What did you just open?
[37:31.580 --> 37:34.060]  My lime breath reserve is exactly dude. She
[37:35.480 --> 37:39.900]  Absolutely hates my keeper phenol of lime breath reserve. She's like that
[37:39.980 --> 37:44.220]  Oh, like anytime I can't smoke it in the house. I can't like and
[37:44.620 --> 37:48.620]  That's phenol like I went to an event like five months ago
[37:49.180 --> 37:52.140]  and I had dispensary owners of denver being like
[37:52.860 --> 37:54.860]  What the fuck is this?
[37:55.500 --> 37:58.700]  And i'm like, yeah, you know, it's just something I kind of made
[37:59.340 --> 38:05.500]  And then even on top of that like one of my good friends that just came out for our annual fishing trip
[38:05.900 --> 38:10.620]  He had bought a pack of lime breath reserve from me. He popped one seed
[38:10.780 --> 38:12.220]  One seed
[38:12.220 --> 38:20.300]  And he found my the keeper breeder phenol of lime breath reserve the lime skunk phenol out of one seed
[38:21.020 --> 38:22.620]  from one pack
[38:22.620 --> 38:27.820]  Takes so it takes one to be a winner. You can plant a thousand but you only need one
[38:29.260 --> 38:33.180]  Dude, yeah, and it was just like, you know him and I loved it
[38:33.500 --> 38:37.580]  And then we went to this event and everyone that smelled it was like
[38:38.220 --> 38:43.340]  Dude, this is the turk profile. You don't even know you need in your life, but you do
[38:44.140 --> 38:46.140]  you know
[38:46.220 --> 38:48.940]  Um, so that was just like wow
[38:49.500 --> 38:53.980]  That's that's incredible kind of like reassurance. You made a keeper, you know
[38:54.860 --> 38:55.980]  so
[38:55.980 --> 39:02.940]  And and when I started up my new room like three years ago, I ran through like 75 lbrs and I was like, yeah
[39:03.500 --> 39:07.420]  They're great, you know, but I did not find one that was like
[39:07.980 --> 39:11.020]  My buddy's cut that is now the breeder cut
[39:11.900 --> 39:13.900]  um, so yeah
[39:14.300 --> 39:19.020]  We're running running numbers of you know the same plant and that's something that I imagine that you've done
[39:19.500 --> 39:21.980]  Mr. Toad with a lot of the lines that you have
[39:22.540 --> 39:29.900]  Is you're able to see a lot of the differences and so you're able to see when that passes on and that always helps working
[39:29.980 --> 39:33.180]  With stable lines to start with and something that you've you know
[39:33.180 --> 39:39.340]  You've taught us all about too is just working with you know, like the polyhybrids versus like regular hybrids
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.660]  and how that takes
[39:41.660 --> 39:44.700]  you know effect in in the in the offspring, so
[39:45.500 --> 39:51.820]  Maybe I can show a picture that shows that from uh, riley's work here that goes through mean gene. Um, right
[39:52.780 --> 39:55.420]  The like mean gene's the monk. It's a deep chunk
[39:56.300 --> 40:02.700]  Plant right and that plant when you breed with it shows up in multiple this is grandchildren of it
[40:02.700 --> 40:05.100]  This is bones. Oh my bones og
[40:05.640 --> 40:06.940]  across to
[40:06.940 --> 40:12.940]  The monk, but this was created by riley, right? This is something he sent to me that I tested out for him
[40:12.940 --> 40:14.940]  This is a plant that's very bullet-esque
[40:15.260 --> 40:18.460]  Deep chunk it has many of the properties that that plant has
[40:19.260 --> 40:21.260]  Okay, it's got different leaves
[40:22.060 --> 40:24.060]  Oh, yeah
[40:25.900 --> 40:26.700]  On it
[40:26.700 --> 40:30.940]  It's a jurassic weed. Um, that's a 15 gallon pot
[40:31.020 --> 40:34.780]  So the the family are almost the size of a 15 gallon pot
[40:35.100 --> 40:38.380]  It basically grows a family the size of a pot you put it in
[40:42.620 --> 40:47.040]  But it grows a very nice crowned out flower like deep chunk or like bubba or nl2
[40:47.580 --> 40:53.120]  Everything it's related to which goes back to breeding with true lines like nl1 and nl2
[40:53.920 --> 40:55.920]  Show up down the line
[40:55.920 --> 41:01.700]  Because they're true breeding lines, right and in today's polyhybrid world when you've crossed all these polyhybrids
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.320]  And tell everyone your plants
[41:04.400 --> 41:09.600]  Mold resistant and pest resistant it has this many traits and shit. They don't understand the words there either
[41:09.920 --> 41:14.560]  They made some cool seeds, but it can't do all that shit when you use true parents that do all that
[41:14.960 --> 41:18.480]  Right, you can offer some killer stuff, but don't claim that your plants are actually
[41:19.200 --> 41:21.200]  Doing any of that stuff when they can't
[41:21.520 --> 41:25.920]  But it just can't do it with what's in a lot of today's poly stuff doesn't make them worse
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.660]  It just makes them not as great for breeding potential
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.440]  When you want specific things out of them like with I just showed with what riley did
[41:33.760 --> 41:38.640]  If you're looking for something that's good for hunger, right? It's good for nerve pain helps with sleeping
[41:39.280 --> 41:45.280]  You want to dive into that afghani side of the line and many cultivars that possess it continue to breed with it like dubba
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.180]  The deep chillin master kush the indies all those things have that potential
[41:51.040 --> 41:57.380]  Understanding the gene pool is where you go through selecting for better breeding instead of just breeding by me
[41:58.020 --> 42:02.580]  When you say, you know dive into that afghani side a lot of people may hear that
[42:02.980 --> 42:06.980]  Um and just be like, oh so he's saying stay on the indica side now
[42:07.540 --> 42:13.300]  Is that a different delineation you're saying specifically afghani lines? Not not
[42:14.340 --> 42:18.740]  Afghani lines are very specific afghani lines that are related through that hindu push
[42:19.700 --> 42:22.500]  Hey and um that um
[42:23.220 --> 42:25.140]  that that line
[42:25.140 --> 42:26.820]  has a very
[42:26.820 --> 42:33.160]  Great breeding potential. There's thousands of afghanis that you could mess with and you could get any kind of flavor through afghanistan
[42:33.780 --> 42:39.860]  But to look through the gene pool that curated like I say baba or that's in the deep chunks and stuff
[42:39.940 --> 42:41.940]  Those things have a very specific
[42:42.340 --> 42:43.220]  um
[42:43.220 --> 42:47.000]  Set of traits that are very easy to pass through into the progeny
[42:47.480 --> 42:51.000]  You don't have to do a lot of work and a lot of selection to find what you're after
[42:51.640 --> 42:55.080]  Because of how those plants have been bred for so long
[42:55.960 --> 42:58.360]  in that area in the region without being
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.840]  Tainted from outside gene, right that outside gene pool can taint
[43:05.480 --> 43:09.720]  Things to where you're not going to be able to get what you want in breeding. Now those things
[43:10.440 --> 43:12.440]  Are what's wrong with today's?
[43:12.840 --> 43:17.640]  Cannabis selections like there's just so much of everything out there, but they're all so
[43:18.420 --> 43:24.840]  Connected that we're not seeing anything novel without doing a lot of massive gene. Um,
[43:25.320 --> 43:31.000]  So like so like like what humble tea company did with the blueberry muffling unless we want to pop 10 000 seeds
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.680]  We're not going to find special shit what we're all growing right now because it's all the same stuff
[43:35.320 --> 43:38.440]  right if we want something special we got to dive into the things that
[43:39.240 --> 43:41.240]  We haven't been fucking with
[43:41.240 --> 43:44.780]  For like 50 years, so we got to try to get before the 60s
[43:45.560 --> 43:49.400]  And to get to the gene pools of the stuff where we've basically caused. Uh
[43:50.680 --> 43:51.720]  um
[43:51.720 --> 43:56.360]  We've killed off so many different lines from breeding for only one type of cannabis
[43:56.840 --> 44:01.080]  That it's kind of narrowed what we can find and what's out there. Yeah. All right
[44:01.160 --> 44:05.800]  Well that that makes me i'm gonna pull out a special one here. This is actually something. Uh
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.040]  from
[44:08.040 --> 44:09.240]  some
[44:09.240 --> 44:11.240]  Some a bitch some people
[44:12.520 --> 44:17.480]  Some people might not know him. I don't i've heard of him. I love that name, though
[44:18.600 --> 44:19.640]  he's a
[44:19.640 --> 44:25.160]  He's he's kind of a private guy. Uh, there's a older gentleman like myself, but
[44:25.800 --> 44:27.400]  he uh
[44:27.400 --> 44:32.680]  Has a lot of his father's work a lot of his father's lines and talking about some of the older stuff
[44:33.320 --> 44:34.600]  and uh
[44:34.600 --> 44:40.360]  This is uh, I love I love this one, uh, the the description on here was the just the
[44:40.920 --> 44:43.560]  the straight crystal covered funk
[44:44.360 --> 44:49.320]  Must be x1 that he was able able to to get out of some of that work
[44:49.960 --> 44:51.320]  um
[44:51.320 --> 44:58.540]  This one, uh, the real this one this one i'm excited for the real kim times in afghani. We were just talking about afghani
[44:59.240 --> 45:01.880]  uh, so these these are uh
[45:01.960 --> 45:03.160]  Uh
[45:03.160 --> 45:08.200]  Yeah, the afghani number one those things also possess a lot of killer
[45:08.840 --> 45:09.960]  um
[45:09.960 --> 45:16.520]  Traits that you would want if you're breeding for what a lot of people call indica these days, which truly aren't
[45:17.480 --> 45:19.480]  especially when you're working with hybrids that
[45:19.880 --> 45:21.880]  We we made here, you know
[45:22.760 --> 45:24.760]  and and and just because
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.360]  I don't know i'm pretty public about my opinion of cookies just because I love making it and I don't know if
[45:30.680 --> 45:34.680]  He did this as like a joke on me just to see if I grow it but uh,
[45:35.320 --> 45:41.660]  So this is his dad's og kush, which has got to be old bread on to girl scout cookies
[45:44.440 --> 45:46.840]  He's he knows i'm gonna pop him too
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.760]  He's like I found a way to convert black stripe. What else does it say on there?
[45:53.480 --> 45:56.040]  Right. Yeah. Well my I was just talking
[45:56.920 --> 46:01.400]  I was just talking to my dad that he used I was like dude if you had those og cushions
[46:01.400 --> 46:04.200]  He used to get this one og kush from this dude
[46:04.760 --> 46:06.760]  back in like 2004
[46:07.320 --> 46:08.840]  the grower like
[46:08.840 --> 46:12.920]  He had this setup to where he had this like townhome or apartment
[46:13.000 --> 46:19.160]  He would go there every night work on his plants and leave in the morning and then act like he's doing his nine-to-five job
[46:19.880 --> 46:24.840]  And my dad would always you know, he would get top dollar for this shit like not
[46:25.700 --> 46:32.040]  450 an ounce like top top dollar and there was one time that he got one
[46:32.760 --> 46:35.640]  that he broke open and found like
[46:36.340 --> 46:41.800]  35 seeds or something and he popped them all and fucking got busted
[46:42.280 --> 46:45.160]  and then actually he had a few left and
[46:46.120 --> 46:48.360]  Now we can't find them, but it's like
[46:49.720 --> 46:53.320]  If we could find those freaking seeds, man
[46:54.360 --> 46:56.360]  Yeah
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.880]  And the same same person sent me a few things, let's see what we got here mr
[47:10.360 --> 47:14.760]  Open pollination, this is ghost ozoo back cross number one. I've also got back cross og
[47:15.240 --> 47:19.400]  Uh ghost og number two if you like that, I know you like og goofers
[47:19.480 --> 47:21.480]  I should send you some of these brother you'll like them
[47:21.720 --> 47:26.040]  These come through the uh ghost of poor royal that kevin gave me which is ghost od
[47:26.680 --> 47:28.680]  Kim dog special reserve that he made
[47:29.160 --> 47:31.560]  I still have some of those that you sent me. I need
[47:32.440 --> 47:37.480]  You know, it's those things are fire dude. That's what i've been doing since since I came back from fucking dying
[47:37.880 --> 47:43.080]  I've been working on this line and didn't make everything public till i'm just about to drop some of them man
[47:43.080 --> 47:46.380]  And these things are fucking stupid those those cdsr
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.400]  F5 or f4s. I sent you dude that whole
[47:52.120 --> 47:58.280]  Those were all just straight fuel and the freaking they were giant big old yielders
[47:58.760 --> 48:04.440]  I sent some I sent some to kevin and I put a big note. I was like bro make more
[48:08.360 --> 48:11.640]  There's some crazy stuff in those man, yeah. Oh, yeah
[48:13.560 --> 48:14.600]  badass
[48:14.600 --> 48:20.840]  Um, the the guy's own machines. He also uh has sent me a few things. I I do a little home grow show
[48:21.480 --> 48:23.800]  on uh the chad westport youtube channel
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.680]  Everybody here pretty much already has the knowledge, but it's still fun to hang out
[48:28.680 --> 48:32.280]  But anyways, he gave me some beans to give away there, which I will give away
[48:32.760 --> 48:37.880]  Uh there as well, but the and I will give away, uh a pack tonight here
[48:37.960 --> 48:42.200]  I'll tell everybody about the giveaway we're doing tonight real quick. Um, but this is
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.580]  An ak-47 times his afghani
[48:48.360 --> 48:49.320]  so
[48:49.320 --> 48:53.400]  This this this might be fun to look through there's three I believe
[48:54.120 --> 48:55.720]  seeds in here
[48:55.720 --> 48:57.720]  Uh, but this will be fun
[48:58.040 --> 49:01.560]  And and I wanted to uh, whoops. I don't know why
[49:02.280 --> 49:04.120]  Oh, did you put that up?
[49:04.120 --> 49:06.120]  Did I put yeah, I did
[49:06.120 --> 49:10.520]  Oh, okay. You did. Okay good. I was just giving them a thumbs up. So I didn't interrupt you. I'm, sorry for talking
[49:10.680 --> 49:15.480]  No, no worries i'll put it back up. I have a happy mouse sometimes like my mouse will randomly click
[49:16.120 --> 49:17.880]  Without me wanting to it
[49:17.880 --> 49:24.120]  So I was like, oh shit random mouse click and see i'm not even i'm there i'm on the big picture right now. Okay, cool
[49:24.760 --> 49:29.240]  Good deal. He's talking about one of my lines. I just wanted to tell him more while you were still talking
[49:30.840 --> 49:32.840]  Nice, um
[49:32.920 --> 49:35.960]  Yeah, I wanted to do a uh giveaway tonight
[49:36.360 --> 49:41.640]  Um, I will give away some of these seeds, but I also I I brought bob into model for me
[49:42.760 --> 49:48.360]  And that's why a few people have noticed bob. Uh, but bob is my model. I have an xl here
[49:48.680 --> 49:55.480]  Uh a c collector shirt right now. There's only three out there. There's myself. There's dave and there's heater. So
[49:56.360 --> 49:58.840]  The fourth one is gonna go out tonight
[49:59.560 --> 50:00.920]  uh
[50:00.920 --> 50:04.280]  and I want to bring in kind of a uh,
[50:04.440 --> 50:11.240]  A celebrity guest here real quick to let you guys know how we're going to do the giveaway. So
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.220]  Let me turn it over to our celebrity guest here
[50:27.940 --> 50:39.220]  Good morning, it's just an expression. How's it going? That means uh, how's it going? It's going fine
[50:40.660 --> 50:42.500]  Glad to hear it
[50:42.500 --> 50:44.500]  So what's today's secret word?
[50:48.180 --> 50:55.060]  Today's secret word is three star now you all remember what to do whenever anyone says a secret word, right?
[50:57.700 --> 51:04.100]  Right for the rest of the day whenever anyone says a secret word scream real loud
[51:04.740 --> 51:05.860]  Ready?
[51:05.860 --> 51:07.860]  Let's try her out
[51:08.020 --> 51:09.380]  Oh jerry
[51:09.380 --> 51:11.140]  Yes, pewie
[51:11.220 --> 51:13.720]  How do you like today's secret word? Oh
[51:19.860 --> 51:21.860]  Good screaming everybody
[51:22.100 --> 51:24.100]  You're all really good at that
[51:24.260 --> 51:25.940]  All right, so
[51:25.940 --> 51:28.500]  In a little bit at some point in the show
[51:29.060 --> 51:35.220]  We are going to say the magic word and then I will have the magic computer collected but not yet
[51:35.300 --> 51:39.780]  You gotta wait for the word and you have to scream at home when you hear it
[51:39.940 --> 51:42.260]  That's that's just one of the damn rules. So
[51:43.380 --> 51:45.540]  That's for the xlc collector shirt
[51:46.020 --> 51:49.320]  And they I believe it's a three pack here of those ak-47
[51:50.580 --> 51:52.580]  times afghanis
[51:52.660 --> 51:56.740]  Courtesy of a sumo bitch and you know what i'll i'll throw in
[51:57.220 --> 52:03.620]  A black lime reserve that cross number one, which is black time reserve that cross to my lamb breath reserve
[52:03.940 --> 52:05.300]  lime scum phenol
[52:05.300 --> 52:07.300]  burrito cut so
[52:07.300 --> 52:10.820]  Yeah out of here i'm gonna shut the show down and join
[52:13.780 --> 52:15.060]  So
[52:15.060 --> 52:20.580]  All right guys, that'll be coming up here soon before the end of the show. I just wanted to tease that one but
[52:21.220 --> 52:23.860]  Kind of get back to what we're talking about here, too
[52:24.260 --> 52:28.260]  I have a dying question because we're talking black lime reserve and I didn't grab my
[52:28.900 --> 52:30.900]  big box of seeds because i've got
[52:31.460 --> 52:33.460]  Enough to go through tonight with everybody
[52:33.700 --> 52:40.340]  Um, but I have black lime in there now black lime is pre black lime reserve. Yes, sir
[52:40.900 --> 52:43.220]  So it also comes from mean gene
[52:44.340 --> 52:45.780]  One morning
[52:45.780 --> 52:47.140]  lime one
[52:47.140 --> 52:53.300]  Lime one. Okay. See I don't know much about that. Maybe you guys can help fill me in because it's one of this
[52:53.380 --> 52:53.620]  uh
[52:53.620 --> 52:58.820]  Four selections that he used to enter in the cupboard would be the lime one and that lime one girl is where
[52:59.060 --> 53:04.500]  All like the lime riley was talking about and his stuff it goes back to that plant that plant
[53:04.820 --> 53:08.900]  It's like a breath of fresh air and shit. Um, she's fucking nice and
[53:09.700 --> 53:12.900]  Gene's like I didn't even do that much selection. She just builds fire and shit
[53:12.900 --> 53:16.260]  And that's the one that fucking did everything for him and like sometimes
[53:16.980 --> 53:21.060]  You don't have to go through 10 000 seeds when you have a good line. That's where good shit is
[53:21.300 --> 53:23.940]  But that yeah lime one is a fucking mama
[53:24.340 --> 53:25.300]  Okay
[53:25.300 --> 53:28.900]  And I believe he called it black line because of its color
[53:29.300 --> 53:36.040]  But it was it's the lime one and that's also he had the lime one bx1 line that he released
[53:36.660 --> 53:39.800]  But it was that line one cross to the cdsr
[53:40.800 --> 53:44.580]  Chemdoc special reserve that made the black line reserve. Okay
[53:45.380 --> 53:49.460]  Yeah, which is in the line we were just talking about which is also on the line
[53:49.620 --> 53:54.980]  That's in this one here that uh chemdocs the the special reserve side that stuff comes out
[53:55.620 --> 53:59.940]  Fire and a lot of it comes through jj star dog the star dog
[54:00.020 --> 54:05.300]  Which has the kim d in it and the kim four and the afghani one. I guess it just spits fire
[54:05.940 --> 54:08.580]  And it's yields you want to talk about a yielder?
[54:09.860 --> 54:11.780]  She puts out
[54:11.780 --> 54:18.340]  No that you know, that is a lot of what I look for. Um these days again, obviously effects. Um are
[54:18.740 --> 54:20.900]  important terpene profiles, but I also
[54:21.620 --> 54:28.020]  Just like good yielders. I again I can only grow a certain amount of plants in a certain amount of space
[54:28.500 --> 54:31.300]  so when I have plants that are just like
[54:32.080 --> 54:38.740]  Exquisite but not the best yielders it all almost, you know leaves me looking for like a filler plant or something
[54:38.820 --> 54:41.620]  you know, i'm like, let me throw a power plant in the corner and just
[54:42.420 --> 54:44.420]  knock it out, but
[54:44.660 --> 54:46.660]  It's good. It's good. It's good to see
[54:47.300 --> 54:52.980]  That people are also working with larger yielding strains because for a while it seemed to be uh,
[54:53.700 --> 54:55.780]  more flavor but smaller
[54:56.420 --> 55:04.100]  Yields. Well, here's here's kind of something a crazy observation i've observed with multiple people growing my land
[55:04.100 --> 55:08.820]  Breaths reserve lime scum phenol is that when you hit her with too much?
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.580]  Phosphorus she grows super fat galaxy like a cookies
[55:15.300 --> 55:19.540]  You know, but if you throw if you do a nice even balanced diet
[55:20.260 --> 55:23.940]  She'll yield very well and she'll put on a lot better
[55:24.480 --> 55:25.620]  stacking
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.540]  uh, and not just
[55:27.540 --> 55:33.140]  Giant brats and look like a cookies plant. Um, because i've definitely like
[55:33.860 --> 55:35.540]  Gone here and there like all right
[55:35.540 --> 55:37.620]  Let's see what you can do and it was like, okay
[55:37.860 --> 55:41.860]  Like you didn't yield that well and you look like cookies and then it was like, all right
[55:41.860 --> 55:44.980]  let's just give you a more even balanced diet and not
[55:46.100 --> 55:52.100]  Even hit you with a pk boost and just kind of hit you with compost extracts and it was like wow
[55:52.660 --> 55:54.660]  Yielded way better
[55:54.740 --> 56:00.420]  And the profile is still there. Um, so it's very interesting to see
[56:01.460 --> 56:03.480]  uh, like different feed schedules
[56:04.420 --> 56:10.340]  Um have their influence on different plants because i've seen I feel like i've seen a lot of cookies
[56:11.220 --> 56:13.720]  Uh that had heavy phosphorus
[56:14.580 --> 56:21.540]  And they just they're like, oh, this is platinum cookies and it's like no that's form cookies just fed heavy phosphorus like
[56:22.180 --> 56:26.340]  I I it's it's interesting to see because you know
[56:27.120 --> 56:33.160]  Genotype plus environment equals your phenotype. So if you change an aspect of your environment
[56:33.780 --> 56:35.780]  aka your feed schedule aka
[56:36.400 --> 56:37.700]  Phosphorus
[56:37.700 --> 56:42.580]  And see what kind of different plant you get versus a more like even balanced diet
[56:43.620 --> 56:51.140]  And that's interesting because we're you know commonly told that you know up your p and k your potassium your phosphorus and flour
[56:51.300 --> 56:53.300]  that's what the plant wants, so
[56:53.540 --> 56:59.380]  A lot of people will and and some plants, you know, it's great like chem plants
[56:59.460 --> 57:04.580]  It's like yeah, that's how you you gmo. That's how you pack on these huge nuns
[57:05.060 --> 57:07.220]  But you do it with cookies plants
[57:08.100 --> 57:15.300]  And not the best idea you do it my blind my lime breath reserve not the best idea. So you gotta
[57:15.940 --> 57:20.580]  Find out like what that cultivar likes to produce the best
[57:22.100 --> 57:24.580]  Out, you know best medicine or but you know
[57:24.820 --> 57:30.340]  It's funny how you could really manipulate a plant based on your environment or feeding schedule
[57:31.220 --> 57:36.500]  And and you tend to or how do you feed what what is your typical plant growing in
[57:37.060 --> 57:38.020]  uh
[57:38.020 --> 57:39.120]  just
[57:39.120 --> 57:43.060]  biodynamic probiotic living organics, so a lot of times
[57:43.940 --> 57:46.100]  i'm, just you know, chop and drop I
[57:47.220 --> 57:50.100]  Grow all my plants and like one gallon pots
[57:50.580 --> 57:56.260]  Cut out like the bottom two inches and then plant those into a raised bed
[57:57.060 --> 57:59.220]  And so it's kind of like a steve can't well
[57:59.780 --> 58:04.420]  Style flat, you know, so it kind of mimics like ivan
[58:05.300 --> 58:06.180]  from
[58:06.180 --> 58:11.700]  Jungle boys, you know, he does the rockwell cubes into the slabs and then you know
[58:12.260 --> 58:15.700]  Does the very minute feeding schedule all the time?
[58:16.180 --> 58:19.640]  Uh, so basically trying to mimic that but in organics
[58:20.340 --> 58:21.220]  um
[58:21.220 --> 58:22.340]  and so
[58:22.340 --> 58:27.460]  With an irrigation system doing the chop and drop doing a cover crop
[58:28.100 --> 58:33.620]  um and then just top dressing with my flower mix I
[58:34.340 --> 58:38.600]  Have a veg and flower mix of just you know, organic soil amendments
[58:39.220 --> 58:41.220]  that i've tried to
[58:41.460 --> 58:44.760]  Get mostly away from any sort of animal byproducts
[58:45.380 --> 58:50.420]  Uh, the only thing I still like to use is some very nice and fluffy bat guano
[58:51.060 --> 58:56.420]  Uh, because even as kevin jodre says as it adds a nice kind of sweetness to the bud
[58:57.060 --> 58:58.660]  um
[58:58.660 --> 59:00.660]  so I will
[59:00.660 --> 59:02.660]  basically mix like a
[59:03.120 --> 59:05.120]  50 50 compost
[59:05.220 --> 59:10.500]  Soil and then either do my veg mix or flower mix and i'll top dress with that
[59:11.140 --> 59:16.180]  Um, but on top of that I will do a compost extract
[59:16.260 --> 59:22.180]  So i'll just get compost put it in a paint strainer makes it up in water. I don't bubble it
[59:22.260 --> 59:24.420]  I don't none none of that's needed
[59:25.140 --> 59:26.340]  um
[59:26.500 --> 59:29.640]  Why would you call why would you culture more soil-borne?
[59:31.840 --> 59:33.780]  Microorganisms in water
[59:33.780 --> 59:39.380]  Never made any sense to me, especially after listening to some scientists on future cannabis projects
[59:39.380 --> 59:42.660]  So now I just put in the paint strainer
[59:43.200 --> 59:44.500]  extract
[59:44.500 --> 59:46.500]  As much as the good juiciness
[59:47.060 --> 59:51.540]  Out of the compost and straight water with that and i'll do that once a week
[59:51.940 --> 59:56.100]  And add some mycos a little bit to it and that's that's all I do
[59:57.300 --> 01:00:03.940]  Okay, tony you've got familiarity with growing your genetics in different environments because you do a little bit indoor
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.020]  You do a little bit outdoor as well
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.540]  um
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.540]  Have you seen that?
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:14.020]  Change a few strains or do you have any strains that you offer that prefer one over the other?
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.900]  uh, well, yeah, there are plants some I breed indoor and outdoor and I
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.260]  I usually do every line that I do that way
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.520]  So I start off by making them inside
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.380]  And sending out those to some testers that i've had for a long time like rain man and such
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.100]  um, and he'll hit me up and be like that shit was whack or that shit wasn't whack and then i'm like
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.100]  All right time to make some
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:42.660]  Outside and i'll make another batch outside and send those out to testers and then once the testers also like what i've sent out
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.960]  I'd make a large batch outside with big plants and it's good that way I have a large population
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.880]  Now from there because I send them out to multiple testers
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.440]  It gives me an idea of what's going to happen with some of these plants that do they like indoor?
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:02.280]  Do they like uh, it's the heat and they like cold. Um, it gives me a great idea like rain man's in
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.880]  Michigan, right and then I've sent some of the lines that he tested all the way up to canada because
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.520]  He gave me good reports on the cold
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.960]  um
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.600]  How well a lot of my new space push lines were doing in the cold
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.720]  So I figured i'm going to send them to even a colder place, right?
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.440]  And that's where I send stuff up to um, don jay farm
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.880]  And to mr
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.480]  Magpie and to jim's garden up there for them to run some stuff out if it could handle cold up in canada
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.400]  That's giving me a great idea that they handle those temperatures
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.920]  Well produce good and they're giving great flavors up there, right?
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.480]  I might end up with stuff that just can't handle that
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.040]  And just don't produce and I could have found that out
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.760]  That's the only way for me to figure that kind of stuff out. I also know that they handle heat because like
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:51.800]  My area i'm in one of the hottest places in the united states and I can't change that there's nothing I can do
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.560]  That's gonna fix it. I can run air conditioners 24 hours a day
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.480]  I can run as many humidity, uh units as I want and i'm still going to be fighting mother nature
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.640]  So instead of doing all that
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:10.280]  I try to breed for what can handle my area and then send it out and find out what will or won't handle other areas
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.200]  And that I don't want to breed for something that's specific to just
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.640]  one
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.320]  Area i'd rather have a medicinal profile from my plants as a trait
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.920]  And let the growers know that they're going to work in your area because I send them to multiple areas, right?
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.920]  I don't want them to have to set up a garden
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.640]  That's very specific so they can only get this one type of fucking reaction from it
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:37.640]  That way it will only work if you grow it this way. It makes sick folk have to go through way too much shit
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.140]  with
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.140]  medicine, so
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.620]  Too and like variety so they can't you know
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:49.140]  It's almost you kind of have to like please the crowd not the individual in this situation. That's why I do a lot of
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.020]  I make a lot of crosses. So
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.900]  Even if they don't make it to market I can offer stuff to people that I know work for stuff
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.500]  Right and i've got a plethora of seeds to give out
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.700]  So that's where I talk about if you're a breeder and not just a seed maker
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:09.220]  You should have seeds that you can give to anybody that is in a position that can't afford them like i've done
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:15.380]  With like you got everyone's seen here with dog a garden what peter set up where we can give away stuff to people who are sick
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.660]  Uh senior citizens veterans disabled
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.460]  Like I got more than enough seed and I can either
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:25.620]  Find a place to bury them and hope that I can come back and get them or I can put them in the hands
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.540]  Of people that need them when they need them
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:32.980]  Like someone just hit me up yesterday about how a line that I produced and gave to them
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:38.660]  Early because I knew it was going to do what I said it could do because of what my mud bone does
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.380]  I sent it out to him. I didn't want to charge them because they hadn't went through testing or nothing yet
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.620]  Right, so I gave it to him
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:50.820]  And today or yesterday they hit me up to tell me that it did exactly what they had hoped for
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:55.700]  Right and his wife was able to get up and go take a walk and they went and she didn't have to come home
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.700]  In pain, right? She was able to get
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:04.260]  And they've been looking for that in some cannabis and haven't found it and i'm like I know I have stuff that can do that
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.940]  If you just let me give it to you
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.720]  And so you don't get charged for something that may not work because there's a possibility
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.700]  I'm, not like fucking a snobby do that. So my shit will do it. No one else's
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:19.380]  I just know through my breeding and how many people i've given that line through and the mother that I use
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:23.140]  What was going to happen? So I sent him the stuff that I thought would work the best
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:28.900]  And it actually helped him out and that's for me easy grow with the medicinal effect is better than
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.460]  Trying to shoot for a purple plant that has to be grown indoors under 86 degrees
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.180]  Right. It's just too much work for sick folks
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.380]  And and i've had to you know, and I do that as well. I have things that
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:45.860]  I haven't released will never release because i'm a little
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.040]  uncertain on
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.800]  Everything but I have sent them to certain people who i've said dude. I have this I have this
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.920]  Can you try something to help and i'll send them with you know, the caveat i'm like, okay watch them
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.440]  but it is nice when you get that email back being like
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.160]  my wife's ptsd is like
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.480]  manageable like
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.320]  That is the one I have this one called wounded warrior. Um good for ptsd good for night times
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160]  One out of probably
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.080]  I don't know. I want to say less than 10 one out of less than 10 will throw herms so
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.920]  It just sits
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.760]  But it's not those people, you know
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.880]  yeah, and I feel like as long as you're like, hey, like I think this will work for you, but
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.560]  you know just watch out like as long as you kind of get that pre-warning like we all know like
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.400]  That cannabis is kind of prone to that but you gotta under you gotta kind of realize like
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.340]  It's like plants it's like tomatoes rely on that like tomatoes are all hermaphroditic
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.400]  so it's just like
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.400]  if you know, so it's just like
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.160]  You know could be beneficial it could be
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.760]  Detrimental but it's like as I feel like as long as you kind of warn people it's like yo, you know
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:10.320]  I think this will be great. You just gotta watch out to the trait that it's helping also like the fact that it's good for
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.920]  PTSD like
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.600]  It the one that shows that might be the one that's the best for that
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.640]  Right, and if we don't look into that one and just realize we're gonna find a few seeds at the end
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.200]  But that shit's gonna help you with what the fuck your your ailment is right like fuck it
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.360]  You see that nine extra seeds
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.520]  At the end of that grow it just in case you lose that plant now you got nine more seeds
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.400]  So next time that's probably gonna carry on that trait, right?
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.080]  Just pop them all and throw the ones away that repeat it but or pick them out, you know and deal with it
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:45.120]  And and like you're like you're saying with lines like that that you're unsure of you're like, yeah
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.880]  I'll i'll give this away to somebody that needs it, but i'm not gonna release this publicly to try to
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.680]  Turn it into anything, you know
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.120]  Yeah, yeah
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:01.520]  And and you know too it is nice because you go through them and you find the ones that won't or won't as easily
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:07.440]  You know, yeah, so you are able to pull something out of it and I have kept it because of the medicinal value
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:14.560]  And dude I I can tell you the countless lines I haven't released because i'm like yeah kind of herms here and there
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.880]  I don't feel comfortable with like dealing with people be like, hey, man, that's looking hermit on me. Even if I tell you
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.600]  Yes
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.600]  Like public worry that gets me
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:32.320]  Even if I tell you hey watch out for herms, I can guarantee you there's gonna be seven out of ten people
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.240]  Hey, man, this fucking hermed on me. Well, I kind of told you that
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:44.640]  You know like so it's just like yeah, there's a bunch there's a lot of stuff that's come back from testing and i'm like
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:49.440]  Yeah, i'm not gonna release that so whatever. Yeah, but that's the point of testing
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.880]  So i'm glad that you know, everybody gets it the valiant effort and you know again like with mr
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.200]  toad, you know you give away so many seeds like
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.600]  You're gonna find out because you get them grown in different conditions. It's funny. You thought michigan wasn't cold enough
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:09.940]  I all these michigan outdoor growers i'm like no way i'm in washington and i'm like I can't grow outdoors
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.600]  If you're in michigan and you're pulling it off man, holy cow
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.600]  Rain man ran my norcal space go outside in michigan and he hit me up
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.440]  He's like that's the most weed i've ever grown off of a plant. That shit is awesome
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.280]  Like he got and i'm like fucking right on dude that most definitely i'm dropping that shit on people when he hit me up and told
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.280]  Me that i might get to plan
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.400]  When did it uh
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.880]  When was he able to harvest it? Like what what mom man? I'd have to go back and check on the dates
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:42.320]  I don't remember the date off hand. I just remember how excited he was that he got this purple plant with pink hairs
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.000]  I finished outside michigan for him and he didn't get moldy
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.160]  It didn't fucking have to get thrown away and he had basically free weed because he didn't have to pay for the electricity to run
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.800]  It that's what I keep telling folks if you can find that stuff
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.040]  You have the ability you can grow a lot of herb outside
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.600]  and compared to trying to grow inside
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.680]  It's just it's not efficient and it's so hard
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.380]  My biggest issue is every time i try to grow outside I get snowed on in september
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  Yeah
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.760]  Yeah
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.920]  I need a greenhouse. I need a greenhouse
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.360]  You start to run some autos out there man. That way you get done in the middle of summer. I did
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.680]  I I did but the autos didn't the medicinal factor just
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.240]  Yeah
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.320]  There's also there is some good companies out there you said you just gotta dig
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.680]  You guys said autos. I got I don't know. I got some autos since the last time
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.320]  I did I actually did because I did I want to run a new water-only
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:51.520]  Uh soil test with some autos, so i'm going to try a few different companies, but this uh chef's cut
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.180]  This was uh iced gushers, uh purple rockberry versus the rolex
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.860]  Hybridized femme seeds if you want to send some to me i'll try them this year
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.840]  I'll i'll let you know my honest opinion
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.460]  Because i'll tell you what i'll let you know my honest opinion on the autos
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:13.460]  I ran and they were they yielded and smelled but didn't get you high
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.060]  Okay, see I have not run autos for years and i've only run a couple
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.500]  But a lot of the people you know newer growers
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:28.980]  This uh skywalker auto times that same purple rockberry times rolex, uh chef's cut again, uh, this is
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:34.100]  But I love skywalker, I love skywalker just
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:40.580]  If if you want to send some to me i'll pop them right when they get here
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.140]  Skywalker. All right. Okay. I have more autos than I could pop
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.340]  So well, which which ones which one skywalker?
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.900]  Skywalker one. Okay, this one this one will have your name on it. I'm
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.660]  Putting it to you. I appreciate that brother. Yeah, no worries. I want to know a chef wants to know too
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:04.740]  Well, i'll i'll tell you what the ones I ran were from ethos is all I gotta say from ethos
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:08.180]  I've i've run two things from ethos before
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:13.140]  And I haven't gone back to those packs, but i've seen a lot of fire coming
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:20.740]  It it's a hit and miss i've ran multiple packs there was one pack I did find two fire females, but
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.420]  Generally overall how much i've ran
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.500]  It's not worth my time effort money to run them
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:38.420]  So into some indusino 2020 for some really good autos that are bred for some very specific reasons instead of just being autos
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:41.860]  Those guys do go through a lot of work to fucking put
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.140]  uh
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:48.340]  Lines together that are fucking real nice dude that some of them are testing fucking real damn high
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.060]  All right. All right
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:56.980]  I had I had to reach back for this and I know you have told me and told us all how to make this before
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:03.780]  Mr. Terran, oh, yeah, I went i'm like, you know what i'm gonna try something that I can't really fuck up too much
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.460]  This stuff works. There's a lot of people out there making one
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:14.580]  Like swerve's got his swerve juice that mendocino stuff riot has one. Um
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:20.820]  Hyde tech makes one that's also a single spray. Um, like i've shown people how to make it
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.860]  It's not hard once you realize how to alter hormones and plants, right?
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:29.380]  once you learn that and becomes almost second nature on how to make a
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:34.340]  A feminine spray there's some things you can do to make them a little more efficient
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:40.900]  That are some secret things if you don't dive into the research far enough, you know, you'll just think silver's all I need
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.340]  but you there's other hormones that you can use and chemicals that can help you
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.380]  get your
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.060]  Well
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.820]  all I gotta say is like
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:57.060]  Between i'm i'm not gonna lie. I'm an absolute newbie to making feminized seeds
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:02.500]  And that's my first time and brother bon is told me his recipe what I love is
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:09.220]  A I have an a and b solution I can store separately for a lot longer than it mixed together
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.820]  So then I can just take a little bit from a and b and make a new solution whenever I need
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:20.200]  On top of that i've found that different cultivars need different ratios
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:26.580]  There's there's some cultivars. They need a little bit heavier. There's other ones. I use the same ratio
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.140]  It burns them and makes them whack out and so
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.940]  I need to dilute it. So it just
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.740]  It's nice because I can a
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:40.500]  Make my own fresh because I can store a and b and then you know
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.380]  Take what I need and then on top of that
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:49.620]  I can test that solution. Sometimes it's a one and done other cultivars
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.700]  It's a one and then two, you know, 10 days down the line, whatever
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:59.620]  It's learning your cultivars that you're working with honestly because i'll tell you what
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.840]  There was one plant I was spraying directly
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:11.380]  And just the mist from that plant to the other plant made it reverse. No problem. No questions asked
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.100]  So yeah
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:21.460]  Super sensitive so it was like wow, it really opened my eyes. Hold on. Let me let me comment on that
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.540]  Yeah, no worries
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:28.660]  I mean and then also like what he's talking about learning different cultivars if you do enough research back in the day
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.500]  There's a cat named countryman
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.460]  and
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.460]  he posted a lot of
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.680]  information on different
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:42.020]  Amounts of sts to use on different cultivars so people don't have to go through doing what he's already done
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:48.740]  Like this information is out there and if you're really into it, you can find it. That's where research comes into it
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.380]  I don't like to give everybody all the shortcuts. So kind of throwing that shit like that countryman
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.180]  hybrid tech
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.540]  bud the deer
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.980]  um and
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:00.740]  and and chimera
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.260]  These are uh some guys in our community that people can look to
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:11.540]  In their old posts on some of the old forums to learn about reversing plants and a lot of their shit goes back to either
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.780]  um mohan ram
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.540]  on reversals
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.500]  or
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.580]  Stoners like us talking about this shit, right and another dude that's listening
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:24.740]  Who's not part of the actual conversation, but it's in the chat or something
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.980]  Going oh fuck. You know what i've been thinking about this. I'm gonna try some shit which comes down to a cat like, um,
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.220]  uh
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:37.460]  Come on his name come out of my mouth. Um, uh, holy crap, dude
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:43.300]  Vic hi, right? So vic. I heard them guys talking about that or a reddit in the forum
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.020]  and he started diving into
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.580]  What's happening? What's the role right and he stumbles upon?
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:55.140]  What he thinks is happening before he even read the papers to tell him
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:00.740]  What was actually happening because some of us out there have been so interested in this shit
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.740]  We're just missing that small little bit of info
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.980]  That helps us unlock shit
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:10.180]  And that where these things are so great things that peter does with this channel and what some of us used
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:15.300]  Use it for like what chad's doing right? Chad's not just sitting here doing videos with stoners like me
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:21.780]  He's writing for for some great shit man, like he's doing a lot of shit with his uh exposure. That's awesome
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.340]  Thank you, man. Thank you
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.860]  And and you're absolutely right
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:30.740]  There's a lot of that farmer's intuition a lot of the things that we know and then you hear it explained
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:34.980]  Just in a different way and you're like I absolutely know what you're talking about
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.420]  so
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.580]  it is that is one of the things with you know, the sprays and the sts too like
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:46.500]  I definitely know the knowledge is there and I will take it upon myself to learn it and to do it
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:51.000]  I wanted to try for the first one just to uh limit my variables
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.940]  But you're right though, you know different different
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.660]  Cultivars want different amounts of sprays and one of the things they say is, you know go light
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.140]  And you're not going to think it's working
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:08.040]  Until it does and I was like I had I was about I had been spraying up before I went to amsterdam
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.840]  Because that I had kind of timed things out and I wanted it things to be pollinated before I went to
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.220]  Amsterdam and then they just do their thing while i'm gone
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.600]  um
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.400]  And it was you know
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:22.840]  It was getting to a couple weeks before that and I was I had almost like given up i'm like, okay
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:29.560]  I'm gonna learn from this one. Maybe you know, I had my environment wrong or maybe the you know, that the health wasn't optimal
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.240]  Something I can learn from the next one and then all of a sudden one day I was like
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.800]  There's balls in there
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.000]  And then it just went and I let it actually
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:44.680]  Continue to uh ball up while I was in amsterdam and then I just came home and gave it the big old
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.440]  And it pollinated everything
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.200]  so
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.400]  Patience and breeding for sure making finchies and reversing a female
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.120]  And if you want to learn even more patience reverse a male have fun with that one. Yeah
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.800]  Yeah
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:07.720]  Why would you reverse a male like what it was a good reason for somebody male so the male genotype has both
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:14.360]  Chromosomes got x and y right so it has ability to give you males and females and with a female
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.880]  You can only get females. So when you reverse a male
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:22.440]  You have the ability to get both sides of that. Uh,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.360]  That that chromosome and the gene pool male and female so say you have 10 seeds, right?
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:35.960]  Some old seeds and you pop them one pops it's a boy and it's your favorite weed from forever you can take that male now
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:41.960]  And cross it on itself and make a seed pool that will give you the ability to find a real female
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.520]  That contains only that gene pool
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.880]  And you can line through that one plant
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.640]  It's a way to save shit like instead of having to go to fems
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:57.000]  And fems are great too for the same thing to saving a gene pool and blocking in a trait
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.880]  But they only give you one side of
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.400]  The possible chromosome matcher, right? You can't get males from a female. All you can get is a female
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.760]  That looks like a male, right? It still only has
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.800]  Two x's there's no y there's no guy in there. I always say that to folks doesn't matter
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.080]  Colin comes out of there
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:22.520]  It contains two x's. It's not a boy. You're never going to be able to take that and get true
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.480]  Regular seeds from a plant that's diocese that makes male and female seeds
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.600]  But you're only going to always be able to make a female side, which is okay, but isn't
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:37.960]  Ideal in my mind as a breeder i'd rather have the ability to have a male and a female
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.720]  So that now I can line breed in a different direction much easier
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.120]  Um, I could find traits that are locked to only the male or female side
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:51.880]  Right there. We know that that's very possible finding stuff that can only show up on the male side
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:58.040]  Now being able to find that in the female gene pool that's in there is possible by reversing a mare
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.880]  and and one thing I will add to that is like
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.240]  what i've kind of found with breeding with femstock as well as like
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.800]  it when you
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:15.240]  When you have a fem line, and then you introduce it to a diocese line
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.000]  like
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.040]  you can find that female a lot easier in that
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:30.200]  Offspring and then on top of what i've found is that you have a lot higher ratio of female to male
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.680]  plants and
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.280]  a lot of times
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:40.920]  At small male population I can really find like oh, this is the female version
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.320]  Or this is a male version of the female
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.560]  and so
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:52.120]  Um, i've actually kind of come to like to you know, certain lines like say the garlic sherbet, you know
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.960]  It's a fem line. It's blue sherbet to gmo
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.640]  um
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:04.760]  but when i've bred with it and i've done this with uh, quite a few others cultivars like grape skunk and
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.080]  uh, some other ones that I just can't think of the top of my head, but
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.640]  You get a higher female population
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.120]  and then yeah you get
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.320]  um
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.640]  Some males, but usually you can find a male that looks like the female you're looking for a lot easier
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.720]  um that and that's just been with the probably
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.960]  Seven or eight lines that i've done. That was a male to a fem line
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.600]  I sorry, I just read a comment from elka
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.500]  So anyways, I guess with that, um tree star
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.640]  Tree star
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.160]  All right, everybody in chat
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:03.080]  Start entering to start and magpie roll. Mr. Magpie roll. This is usa only I apologize
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.800]  But this is usa only because it involves seeds
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:12.520]  So where did my gifts go here my gifts go? So one more time. This is for the fourth
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.600]  in existence seed collectors t-shirt. It's got the
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:23.640]  It's got dane's little logo over here dave's not here. It's got the twig peaks. It's got the future cannabis
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.040]  It's right behind me on bob actually, so
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:33.020]  That's what that is. So you'll get this you get the selma bitch grade a seed. This is an ak-47
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.720]  times afghani
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:36.680]  and
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.680]  We had the bonus. What was the bonus?
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:46.280]  It is the black lamb reserve bat cross number one bat cross to my lamb breath reserve
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.520]  Lime skunk breeder feno get the heck out of here
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:58.280]  Oh everybody if you are, uh in the us and you are in chat, let me
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:05.000]  Remember guys, you got to spell it exactly as it's there. It won't work. Don't capitalize it just tree star small
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:10.040]  Little hint there. There we go. Tree star. Yep. Tree star will work. It looks like we've got
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.240]  52 entries already
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.880]  That's awesome, we'll make sure to
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.400]  Rule
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.400]  Magpie my guy
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.000]  It's all right, he's got enough of my seeds man. I sent that dude about 7 000 packs of different
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:36.040]  So the canadian new year, yeah, I love him and you know what he will pop every single thing that he gets
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:42.760]  He does not know how to hold beans i'm like so magpie, how do you save seeds he's like
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:49.960]  Asking about the cheese star and uh, he won't stop he loves that stuff
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.520]  I love it. I love it
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.480]  Speaking of things I love though while votes coming in is people kind of know that I love
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.200]  dad jokes, so
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.080]  Let me share a couple with you
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.400]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right, so let's get to this one here
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.640]  I'm gonna i'm gonna highlight myself. I'll make myself big because I love my dad jokes. So
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.320]  What do you call a magician who's lost his magic
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.400]  Ian
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:29.080]  What do you call two nuns on the run virgin mobile
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.560]  Okay, this is one of my favorite I tried this the other day with you though tony
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.120]  What do you call a chicken staring at lettuce?
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.720]  Chicken sees a salad
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:50.120]  And one more what do you call two octopus that look the same
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.960]  I tentacle
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.400]  YouTube youtube, what what are you doing youtube?
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.040]  I walked into the kitchen yesterday and I said to my dad. Hey, i'm hungry
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.200]  And my dad said

[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:26.940]  on top
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:34.860]  On top of the fact that I found it an absolutely incredible mail from archive. He made face on fire
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.940]  Which is y543 to the face off
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.460]  uh bx number one and I found
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:45.020]  um a really

[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.040]  wi-fi I
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:15.280]  Wi-fi, dude, I something so special about what og rascal did with wi-fi
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.680]  And I I plan to get the actual cut, you know here in a few weeks
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:28.640]  Um, but I must say the wi-fi face off from archive that I found
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.420]  Is almost like an upgraded version. It's not nearly as stretchy
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.300]  it
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:42.800]  Stacks, I mean dude, I get wet nugs that are the size of my hand like they're giant
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:49.520]  And they just they're just like straight wi-fi. It's like an upgraded version of wi-fi
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.920]  so
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.920]  super girlfriend well
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:35:00.400]  She can be a little tricky, you know dialing in her veg aspects, but once you do
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:05.040]  yeah, she'll produce for you and I mean the the
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.080]  Plant I just did in my recent, you know doing one gallon into
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.720]  the raised beds
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.600]  like
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:21.120]  It easily pulled four to five ounces out of one gallon pot. That was just transparent into raised bed
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.800]  So I was like
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.800]  That I can I can do
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.680]  um
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.040]  On top of it just being surreal dank og so
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:40.000]  um, the wi-fi 43 is one of my top strains definitely in my top 10 probably top five
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:47.520]  And and I mean anytime I smoke friends out with it. It's just like gk. Oh like they're like dude. What the fuck?
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.240]  You know, um
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:51.920]  And then
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:59.120]  On top of that I have so when I went down to this recent seed event a few months ago. I met a few
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.060]  phenomenal slept on breeders
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.920]  uh, and
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.840]  one of them is
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:12.480]  Salt city genetics. He's based out of denver. He just did a shark tart cross. That sounds phenomenal with
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.640]  summer rides gear
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:17.040]  Um, and then I got my brother
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.860]  uh
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.920]  Generation new beard new breed genetics
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:25.020]  Awesome brother brandon over there
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.780]  he
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:30.700]  Set me up with some slimer og back cross number ones
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.840]  so this is
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.620]  wi-fi 43
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.620]  fem to ghost og
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:41.580]  so ultra excited about that and then
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.360]  the
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.360]  fan boy
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:51.180]  Or fb to slimer og fan boy is tahoe
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.000]  og
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.360]  Cross to jedi kush or jedi kush jedi og. I believe it was from swerve
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:36:59.960]  um
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:08.040]  That hit to the slimer which is the wi-fi 43 to go. So it's just like og og og og og so
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:09.960]  that's
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:16.920]  That's just what i've been looking through is a lot of og at the moment and kind of working with some of the
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.800]  Grape limeade urkel stuff I got from mean gene. So
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.600]  Kind of contrast to to the og too
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:33.800]  I I ended up just not having patience. I was gonna have patience to do a whole grape line
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.960]  and I
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.960]  Made the grape limeade
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:41.960]  Grape fly minute f2s can't even talk right now
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:47.960]  um, and I had selected through those and found some killer plants because that was
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:50.580]  honestly one of my
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:52.360]  favorite cultivars
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.280]  That he had made but was never like publicly released
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:02.600]  And so I was like dude, like I miss smoking this stuff. I need to grow some and so
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.280]  um
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.280]  Yeah, I ended up finding
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.960]  It didn't have
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.480]  I don't know why
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.440]  Um from the seed stock I had made from the f1s, but I didn't have the best of luck
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.760]  of germination rates, but out of what I did get I was
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:25.400]  Able to collect some good pollen from three males out of like eight males that I found
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.280]  and then
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.500]  I've kept one really really nice female. She's my number 23
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.460]  She's really urkel dominant
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:37.820]  um
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:41.900]  But I made a nice population of f3s to go through
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:48.060]  But yeah, that's one line that it it's one that jackson was thankfully
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.780]  shared with me
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:52.380]  uh, but he never
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.660]  released and I never released it publicly and
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:59.820]  I hit it with black lime reserve and that's one of my

[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:22.000]  We may have heard of them. We may not have but that's here's one
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.120]  My buddy bird
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.040]  Bird, uh bird genetics. He goes by brent key usually on youtube
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:36.480]  He's doing some work with an afghani that he's got an afghani. Um, heirloom line. He's crossed that to some of my um
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.640]  Bubble crosses and to some other stuff from uh, aka bean brains
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.080]  um
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:47.360]  He's doing some killer stuff. He's also got abc continuations. He sent me some of those
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.960]  He's got some auto flower work that he's done
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.520]  Um that i'm working with like
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:57.040]  He's got a passion for the plant and it's coming through on the crosses that he's doing
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:03.920]  He's not just doing shit willy-nilly like that afghani stuff. He's growing looks like the picture I showed you earlier
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.320]  of the um
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.400]  Stuff from riley right the wide leaf short plant crowned flowers
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.540]  but they bring those
[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:14.800]  specific medicinal qualities in plants or
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.180]  Whatever you want to call them. They help people with fucking nerve pain and sleep aid and ptsd
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:24.480]  They're great for that, right? You don't have to look for one cultivar
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:28.560]  You look for a gene pool and that's one that comes from that brent's been doing killer stuff
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.320]  uh my buddy
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.340]  Cam, he has uh, the elephant seed company, right? He does small batch breeding with some killer selections
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.100]  It's called the elephant seed supplier. He's on instagram
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.320]  and on facebook
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.880]  uh, these are a lot of stuff that he did with the um,
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320]  What is it the super skunk f5?
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:56.240]  Uh across the some elite mothers like the star dog and um, man, I can't remember
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:00.160]  I can't read these damn things. They're so small. I usually have to take a picture of them
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.120]  But it's packaging small become a little glass stars. They're killer stuff
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.200]  Right, uh riley talked about nick earlier
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.720]  Um nick's a homie him and his wife have been doing some killer stuff with plants and on their farm
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:21.040]  Like he's the heart of the breeding and him and her together have got a fucking farm that anyone could be proud of like real
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:25.440]  Absolutely his hugel culture beds. Oh, man. Yeah
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.960]  I I just tried to mimic that on my own in a three by three. So I tried to do a uh,
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:34.960]  Raised bed hugel culture out here that i'm going to put up against just a normal
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:38.640]  soil bed or soil pot in a living soil system to see
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.240]  how they uh react next to each other right and
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.720]  In my wheelchair it was hard to put it together
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.400]  But if that works it's gonna help with year-to-year growing instead of having to fucking re-imagine shit every
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:56.880]  Fucking few weeks in there that hugel culture will feed itself after it starts breaking down for sure. Yeah
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:04.320]  Right. Uh, I got some stuff that like my buddy nick. Um, he's a breeder. He's not in cannabis anymore
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:07.040]  But uh, he used to be the breeder for the god
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.120]  Nick bolton the homie
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.800]  This stuff gave me back in a day that he was from his collection
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.760]  It's the 79 christmas beans the christmas bud. I've
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:23.920]  Chris has been trying to get me to pop about this year, but these are my collection from him
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.520]  Um, yeah, those are fucking nice. I got stuff from art from round table collection
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.000]  Um, this is something me and nick used to give art a lot of bullshit, right?
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.280]  So he said he was gonna send nick some seeds and nick kept telling
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.840]  on the moon
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.760]  Fucker so he named this little asshole. Oh gee because it was being an asshole. This is a special pack here
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.840]  This is a fucking uh, pakistani
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:52.160]  Called the hells. All I gotta say brother
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.000]  All I gotta say is me and art swap beans
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:04.880]  And the beans he had sent me in the swap I they they would pop but they would never come above soil
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.720]  Oh i've had those man i've had those
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:18.720]  We got stuff from uh soul rebel in the collection here, um, I got a whole box of stuff from uh,
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.680]  Straight a genetics over here, but yeah
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.560]  So many boxes to get to it that I can't pull it out
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:28.960]  I mean it's pissing me off that I can't grab those right now, but i've got those stashed over here
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.560]  Um, I just I got so much stuff here. You guys it's crazy
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.520]  Crazy
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:53.120]  I got like five packs from homeboy. Here's one of the straight apex right here. There's a driving miss cherry
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.880]  um
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.640]  What else do I got in here? I got stuff from um, let's see
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  I know I got some stuff
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:08.480]  Old stuff a lot of stuff's not in the packaging. Here's a pack the captain for 20 sent me from the
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.440]  Old school breeding league. This is the uh, kim
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.320]  91 to uh, og push
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.360]  That's going to be fire. Um, i'm trying to find some of the original packs from riley
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.120]  One of the first packs I got from riley was a cross called dad's plant
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.760]  right
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  It was
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:37.680]  Like when he knew I wasn't full of shit right riley hit me up he had levi up he hit scott from rare dankness up
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.580]  Right. He's asking all of us about this plant that he's describing
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.920]  And shit, and we're all like it's green crack like all of us, right?
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:51.440]  It comes down to even even scott from there scott from rare dankness. He was like, yeah, that was green crack
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.560]  What else doing that?
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.560]  Because I was actually I had this one pulled out so I was going to ask you about this one because this one will get popped
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.200]  Sooner than later. I mean damn I can't see but it is it's your green crack. Yeah
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:11.840]  Dude last time I grew those outside and southern so when I grow them outside like are these big for the girls?
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:15.220]  Oh my lord. Did you want to talk about giant?
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:17.980]  colas, holy shit
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:25.200]  Dude, I grew those outdoors in the mojave desert. I had to fucking I had to put up a shed
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:30.160]  Or a shade system because it was just so hot like we got
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:33.280]  122 degrees or some shit
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:41.140]  Yeah, I did i'm in colorado now, um, so anyways dude, I grew those outside
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:49.360]  And those threw huge bats and they were just dank green crack like smelling but they like
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.980]  between both crosses
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:56.240]  It was just giant yielders, it was incredible
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:00.160]  Um, so I would highly recommend those outdoors
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:04.380]  I know I breed mostly indoors now
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:10.380]  But like a lot of the genetics I work with came from outdoors
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:15.920]  So it's like they came from outdoors. I breed them indoors. They still work really good outdoors
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:17.900]  um
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:24.620]  So yeah, if you do those and I remember I was harvesting those I want to say the end of september around
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:28.140]  beginning of october and dude, they were just
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.820]  Yeah
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:39.340]  Yeah, and you can you can feed them like, you know, don't be scared like you want to give them a compost extract every week
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.500]  and top dress them
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:45.420]  The third weekend ish on flowering like don't be afraid
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:50.380]  Now is that is that just green crack or durban poison in general or this?
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:57.820]  Oh, I feel like I mean i've grown them separately and I feel like they were both
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:02.560]  Pretty good feeders because especially green crack would just throw these big old avocado
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:08.300]  mangoey body odory kind of just turfy nug like
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:14.780]  I need to grow I cross that green crack to scotts og and that's I really want to throw those
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:17.500]  um, I need to um
[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:23.180]  I just uh, oh we lost toad. Hopefully he knows the number i'll reset
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:28.860]  It's probably his internet. But um, yeah, I need to grow some of those for sure
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.860]  uh
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:36.540]  Yeah, green crack. I mean dude, I feel like that's one that nobody's really working with lately
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:40.780]  I have one buddy that i'm like getting a cut of it back from
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:47.980]  But that was one cultivar I was like I personally I mean maybe other people don't like it but
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.500]  I really was fond of that one
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:58.860]  And I mean, dude, she just big old avocados and fall over and she she was something special
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:01.340]  and what's funny is I originally
[01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:08.060]  Got her as a herb. My dad had originally got her as a first-time patient gift at
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:10.540]  a dispo in like burbank
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:16.380]  California and he got alaskan thunderfuck and we grew it out
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:22.140]  And we're like, okay, whatever and then the more I gave it to people like tony
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:27.580]  Levi and scott and they're like nah, dude. This is green crack and I was like
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:32.540]  All righty then like sweet. So it just goes to show
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:39.500]  It's crazy how the weed industry was especially back in like prop 215. It was like
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:44.060]  Oh your first person patient and here's a free clone gift
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:48.620]  and it was like they had a bunch of different labeled clones and
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:54.480]  You know, he chose atf and it was definitely not alaskan thunderfuck
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:57.420]  He was like they did have green grass
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:53:02.620]  He was like obviously and I just mixed up a bunch of plants and they were like we're just giving out plants
[01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:05.980]  The drop tray
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:09.840]  Is yeah, but I mean that's kind of funny too because when I worked commercially
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:14.160]  What we were selling as green crack was actually uh, cherry's jubilee
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:20.780]  And for like the longest time I thought I didn't know the difference until I was corrected
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:25.580]  But I was like, oh that green crack because it had just this amazing smell. It was like a wine smell. I loved it
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:28.620]  I'm, like i've got to hunt down this green crack. I've got to try this green crack
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:35.660]  Yeah, and then and then I was you know informed otherwise, but then I was exposed to green crack and
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:40.540]  Yeah, I miss it because that's not something that I see a lot around here
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:44.540]  I can't remember the last time i've seen it actually
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:49.980]  When was the last time you saw golden goat how popular it was versus how often you see it now?
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:55.020]  Yeah, actually kind of the same time frame and that's kind of funny enough is when the winded warrior that I was
[01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:58.380]  Talking about and working on was this the same same time frame?
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.620]  Same same company had had the two. Wow. Yeah, no
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:08.700]  There's there's a lot of things we lose to time unfortunately with our well, you know with our scene collector habits
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:14.620]  I just got golden goat back. So and I just flowered her out and it is gold goat
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:18.460]  1000 she oh i'm so excited
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:24.780]  That's badass now what what what makes you uh, I think tony's frozen here
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:29.420]  Um, yes, and then that might be having a rough time. Okay
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:35.340]  Keep giving it a shot. Uh, yeah, please because we we want you we need you here brother. We need you
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:40.300]  I know I still want to talk because you know, we were talking about earlier, you know, the the wi-fi 43
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:46.380]  uh, but one of uh his crosses here too is the the space fondue is uh,
[01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:49.100]  Let's see here. Let me blow myself up. Oops
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.660]  uh fire og
[01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:53.660]  Yeah
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:55.980]  Fire og
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:55:04.540]  Geez and this one he sent me, you know again, he's a very generous person and he knows that I helped get them out
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:05.900]  uh
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:09.900]  But this space fondue I was like, I need to hold one of these back for myself
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:17.900]  Yeah, absolutely fire. Good luck finding fire. Oh gee like she's a rough one to find just by herself
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:23.580]  And so another good thing that I I do enjoy about uh,
[01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:28.560]  You know tony is that I am confident in like the provenance
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.980]  Of the cuts that he gets or the seeds that he gets so
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:38.380]  That that helps me feel confident because a lot of these things, you know, like I always say to you like acapulco gold
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.980]  I've smoked it
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:43.820]  But have I really actually smoked acapulco gold? I don't know
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:51.580]  And I probably never will i've been told to have but and that's and that's where like when I get a cut
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:56.700]  I want to verify it when I flowered out and smoke it and I
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:04.380]  Talk to all these people and they're like, yeah, that's it. Whereas people's are like, yeah. No, I don't you didn't get the right thing
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.480]  verifying cuts is
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:14.620]  Like not everyone does it ever there's I know so many I shouldn't say I know so many people but I see so many people
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:21.500]  That'll get something cross it to everything. But yeah, it's whatever and i'm like really did you spend time growing?
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:23.020]  It out
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:28.460]  Smoking it talking to other people that have actually had it and being like, yeah, this is the right thing
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:30.940]  like verifying cuts is
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:34.780]  Not always like not everyone's down to do it. So
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:43.420]  You know, I feel once again, I feel like tony, you know when when it comes to certain cold cultivars that he makes crosses with like you can
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:47.100]  Reassure yourself. That's the cut, you know. Yeah
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:50.460]  Yeah that again too makes me feel good because
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:56.940]  Like I said, I and I just actually gave an example of how commercially sometimes things just get renamed
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:00.540]  Yeah, you know
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:05.100]  Having having that provenance is important and it's I don't know if it's funny or not funny
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.400]  But we were talking tony about the the wi-fi 43
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.140]  uh, and you were having wi-fi issues, but I
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.540]  I
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:19.020]  Had brought up that I wanted to you know ask you about this man. I was a space fondue
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:25.420]  Times that space cheese and I I know them both separately but together
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:32.700]  Boy, i'm curious. Oh man. That's the fire. I thought if ganja and uh, jen's gardener in here. Um,
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:38.300]  They ran that shit up in canada and man the pictures they sent me were so fucking nice
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:44.060]  There was one of the plants that jen selected that looked so much like fire og in the plant structure
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:48.460]  And the shape of the plant and the bud shape. It was nice man
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:53.260]  And that fire is a cut that I had my possession for 17 years
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:59.980]  I love that plant. I I need a pop of those raindrops. You sent me
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:06.140]  Raindrops my guy the the raindrops what he's talking about is named after our birdie rain man
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:10.960]  He's been my longest tester running. Um, I got this selection
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:18.220]  Of six seeds out of an ounce of bud that my buddy grew from I gave him fucking 12 clones, right?
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:20.780]  I gave him six fire og and six kosher kush
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:24.700]  He put him in the room grew the plan out and when it was done
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:30.380]  He gave me fucking the ounce of fucking fire og for fucking saying thank you for giving him the clones
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:34.620]  And in that one ounce I found confound six seeds those six seeds
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:38.860]  I got one plant to germinate and it was a plant that I called playing with fire
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:42.400]  I smoked that shit and three hits. I lost my joint in the refrigerator
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:50.080]  I found it hours later in the refrigerator going back to go get something to eat because I was hungry as a motherfucker
[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:55.500]  And the joints in there staring at me and i'm like, oh shit that's playing with fire right there. Yeah shit
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:59:03.020]  It's dangerous I took that and crossed it to angel and made raindrops and that that's one of my favorite plants and shit the raindrops
[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:08.380]  So I wish I wouldn't have lost that uh playing with fire when I got sick. It's one of the plants I lost
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:16.060]  I got in the last 15 years from seed. That's probably the best weed i've ever smoked. It's a random bag seed
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:22.860]  That I didn't make that some dude that could give a fuck about making seeds ended up making because he grew his plants
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:25.260]  into the fucking hoods
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:28.620]  And they fucking got heat stress and ended up showing
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:32.220]  male sex in that room and pollinating the plant
[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:37.820]  And that's the only thing that happened because he'd never grown real ogs before and they stretched on him
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:43.980]  He grew him fucking five feet in a room that had six feet of clearance and he fucked the whole plants up and shit
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.620]  That's how we end up with just the bottoms of this room
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:51.900]  That produced because the whole top turned white and the plants were heat stressed out looked like shit
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:58.380]  But from that womb that you had weed that was the most mids bammer you could get because someone fucked it up
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:02.140]  Produced six seeds that gave me some of the best weed i've ever fucked with
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:08.460]  It was awesome I fuck with bag seed, especially if it's like
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:13.100]  You know
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.100]  Dude, that's when I found
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:21.260]  Three garlic sherbet seeds out of six ounces of weed. I was like, all right, this gotta be something good like
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:28.300]  And then one of them popped I was like and then it was like incredible. I was like, all right. Well
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:35.420]  It had that jurassic park feature man. It found a way it wanted to survive that much that it planted like
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:37.900]  one seed per ounce
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:38.780]  Yeah
[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:40.780]  But it found a way
[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:44.940]  Yeah, I like that not sure
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:47.980]  Fuck with the bag seed
[02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:53.660]  Like today's market I could lie and say I made it and there's a special limited run and shit and I was like man
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:57.660]  I found this weed and some shit some homeboy gave me. It's the best shit. I fuck with him
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:02.860]  And yeah, that's how we should just be as true as possible with what we have. It don't matter who made it
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:07.980]  It don't matter what the gene pool if it really is that great like let's fucking pass around and find out
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:12.780]  I gotta go get a phone charger. So i'll be right back. Yeah, go get a phone charger
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:15.980]  Uh, because I don't want to lose you what we can keep going
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:20.300]  I definitely have got some more seeds to show off, but you just mentioned. Um
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:26.560]  you know genetics and uh going back to what we were talking about earlier, we're talking about s1
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:28.220]  and
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:31.580]  when you self a plant a lot of the like
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:34.940]  Thought is it's going to be identical to
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:40.940]  What was actually self but the genetics of it is it's more likely to be
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:44.540]  Like the grandparents or how how does that work?
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:51.500]  So an f1 of a true f1 is an s it's just an f2. It doesn't matter if you're making a family line
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:54.060]  now it could be that um
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:55.660]  you're uh
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:57.740]  you're feminizing a very
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:04.540]  Worked line, right? So you will get the same thing repeatable, but it's still not the same plant through meiosis
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:10.460]  You automatically lose half of that plant's gene pool when it came in contact with the other side of itself
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:12.840]  And now you have a new
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:15.980]  Combination of what's available in that gene pool
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:21.340]  So and you could be locking it in more by using something like say deep chunk and feminizing it
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:25.660]  You're going to lock in whatever that one cultivar has a lot because of the alleles will line up
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:27.880]  but if you try to
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:29.880]  Feminize something that's a polyhybrid
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:33.420]  You could start seeing grandparents and even farther back, right?
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:37.260]  You're going to find traits in there that weren't available in the f1
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:43.260]  Or even in the two parents at all because of how those plants will realign if you go through enough of those you will find
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:44.700]  very special
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:49.820]  Stuff that just wasn't available in either parent or the f1 and that's where I find magic
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:54.860]  For my own breeding that's different than say like all three of us could take the same seed
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:03:00.540]  And if we do enough selection can breed in complete different directions with the same gene pool
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:06.220]  As long as that gene pool was open enough like a true wild eco type of cannabis that breeds
[02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:12.220]  Uh heterozygous instead of homozygous that bug that bug just like straight beeline for your head there
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:14.620]  Yeah, that thing's trying to get me dude that thing
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:18.700]  Dropping knowledge dropping knowledge
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:20.780]  so
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:21.740]  Okay
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:26.940]  Because I was curious about that, you know a lot because you do see a lot of that with um, like cumbolt, uh, csi
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:29.740]  there's other breeders out there who
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:35.580]  S1 a lot of stuff and then people will get that be like, oh i've got og kush
[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:38.620]  so no, it's really
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:44.540]  Again, you have the gene pool, but you don't have that one particular plant right? So that one plant
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:47.820]  Starts giving up what's inside of itself
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:51.980]  That's how you can find out like if you take 10 different og cuts
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:56.780]  And feminize them you can find out if one of them offers those other ones inside of itself
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:02.060]  or if it does not like does tahoe g give you triangle and ghost and uh,
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:07.680]  And all the other ogs or vice versa, right and when you see that through doing an s1
[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:12.380]  it lets you understand the gene pool better, right you can find out if
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:18.300]  Your hunch is correct. Is the purple coming from one side of this plant or another you can find that through
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:22.780]  Doing an s1 right you'll be able to dive through enough of that seed to go
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:27.580]  This trait's hidden in there, but I know that this is in another plant
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:33.100]  100 right to see a leaf structure that pops out of something all the time
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:35.580]  but
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:38.220]  You someone told you it was a whole different thing, right?
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:42.300]  And you know for a fact by growing enough of this gene pool and enough of this one
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:47.980]  That for a fact it's coming from this other one. I don't care what they told me they either were making it up
[02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:53.260]  Didn't know themselves or were just trying to be shady because they don't want me remaking it, right?
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:55.900]  And all those things are viable options in our community
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:05:01.500]  Right and business strategies telling someone different gene pool to what you have
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:07.020]  Is a way to ensure that everyone's not making the same shit you got, right? That's business
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:11.580]  and I must say like with like banking off of that like
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:13.260]  just
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:20.380]  Showing the plants that I was selecting through for this black lime reserve open pollination f3
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:22.060]  like
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:26.300]  Mean gene was saying like yeah, like most of those look like lime one
[02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:32.460]  You know the lime special plants that I play with and I feel like a lot of the black lime reserve
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:36.220]  filial generations, I see other people produce
[02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:42.220]  Are csr or cdsr dominant because they yield better
[02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:44.300]  um
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:51.020]  To where I feel like i've selected my line more towards the lime side of things
[02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:55.500]  And they haven't got to taste the the lime one or talk to gene about that stuff
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:06:01.420]  So it's harder for them to make the selection that you have because they haven't had the experience to be able to do so
[02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:09.100]  And the access that's that's kind of a fun thing about you guys too for everybody who picks your step off off of like vegas
[02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:11.260]  uh or directly
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:13.260]  Um, you guys are both pretty accessible
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:16.140]  Yeah, I try to be trust me
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:19.980]  But even then I always that was the only way I got here was being
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:24.220]  Accessible like in the early days if you didn't show this stuff, you look like you were lying
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:27.420]  And if you were lying once you were lying all the time
[02:06:27.820 --> 02:06:35.420]  So like you can go back on my facebook and find breeding rooms of me breeding these with the parent stock for fucking
[02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:41.900]  Like 14 years now or even longer. I showed every one of my breeding rooms in the early days publicly
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:48.220]  So that people would know I wasn't full of shit and then I did testing publicly so everyone could see
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:52.140]  You know for real that I didn't just grow a special plant in my garden
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:56.060]  Like rain man did it in the cold and i'm over here where it's 100 and fucking fuck you degrees
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:00.380]  Strength is a real thing
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:03.740]  So i'm showing what no one else was doing at that time
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:09.740]  Not a lot of people publicly were showing all their lines being tested by other people who could say fuck you
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:15.420]  Like your weed sucks right at any moment rain man could have said that shit. I didn't know him for a long time
[02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:19.500]  I didn't know the dude and then we met and we become lifelong friends, right?
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:22.140]  He could have just been some random dude
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:27.180]  That was crazy as hell or I could have been that crazy motherfucker and we could have screwed each other over in the early days
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:33.500]  With your planter intersex, right? That was something that went around everywhere. They were trying to break each other down
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:37.660]  For him so hard over that it was crazy because no one knew why
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:44.780]  Intersex happened right? We're just saying that he did it on purpose this motherfucker sucks. It's like whoa, dude, your garden might be back
[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:47.500]  Yeah
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:51.260]  No one wanted to admit that shit and now today we will admit that our garden sucked
[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.900]  That's how we got past it. Like we're all shit
[02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:59.020]  I fucking like my air conditioner went out and it hit fucking 90 degrees for three days
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:02.780]  And now I have an intersex issue 14 days later. It's not the breeder
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:07.180]  That's my environment. All right, we understand that because of hormones today
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:13.440]  Right and selection like if i'd make a 10 000 seeds and out of those 10 000 100 show intersex
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.700]  It's not the whole line man. It's just a selection of seeds
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:22.620]  They got to be thrown out and that's part of the game, right finding the best weed out there came from those kind of accidents
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:25.260]  so
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:29.660]  And I must say like even when I did my selections with this black lumbers or
[02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:35.260]  F2 line into the f3 is like I definitely saw good
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  Probably
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:42.460]  13 plants out of the whole population that were throwing
[02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:45.420]  the variegated, you know
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:53.500]  mutation from the chem dog line that was throwing mutants so I chucked all of those to get you know,
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:59.740]  try to help clean that out of the line to keep anyone from having mutant looking plants and
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:01.180]  It's
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:03.660]  I'm, sorry. Sorry to interrupt there, but I know you're good
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:08.220]  I've heard that before as they say, you know the variegation on the chem lines now with the variegation
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:13.100]  Are we talking about like a splotchy colorness on the leaves or is there like well or a miss?
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:15.340]  Well, I mean
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:17.340]  Mo if you run
[02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:21.200]  Chem like it's mostly the splotchy
[02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:26.220]  You know discoloration, but if you if you breed with it
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:33.340]  It starts to become more mutant like and yeah, you can grow that line out but a it's
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:36.300]  a little bit slower and b
[02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:39.660]  I don't know. It's never
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.660]  been something
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:45.500]  They've never produced plants that I was like, oh, I want to continue breeding with this
[02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:50.780]  so, you know the easy visual indicator of like yeah, that's not going to be the winner because you
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:55.180]  Enough people have grown out that that variegation and they're like
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:58.380]  And you can find
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:02.000]  Good chem line that doesn't produce the variegation
[02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:05.660]  Okay, so it's just like you don't listen
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:08.940]  Necessarily have to be like yeah, that's chem
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:14.460]  It's just like you can kind of select towards that and be like, all right, we got some you know
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:16.220]  from
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:21.260]  The terpene profile from how it kind of grows from the structure of the buds
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:29.920]  Um, there's definitely a lot of different distinctions you can be like, all right, that's more camel leaning than limelight
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:36.860]  And not necessarily have to be like, all right, that's very that's camp, you know, right
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:40.140]  so I like
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:47.200]  I feel like because I did get some complaints not gonna lie from a few people from getting mutations from the variegated
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:54.320]  And I you know threw my new pack on me because i'm like yeah, okay like I totally understand like here you go, you know
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.520]  But
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:02.320]  I'm not i'm i'm kind of selecting that out of what I was
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:09.360]  Right, and that's your that's your intention and I think people also need to realize too
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.120]  um
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:13.120]  You know at least me I don't have a you know
[02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:18.320]  100 000 square foot facility where I can run the numbers to really do a lot of these things. So
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:19.920]  they're
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:21.500]  breeding is
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.120]  mathematics and
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.600]  Oh, yeah, there's certain things that are really out of your control and you know, I I go back to
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.360]  You know, sometimes i'll find a herb in a you know
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:35.680]  Trust your breeders pack that i've grown a million times never had a problem
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:41.200]  But there will always be that one in ten thousand who knows if this was just that one in ten thousand. So
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:42.160]  Exactly
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.960]  It's it's hard to put that on the breeder fully
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:53.280]  No, and I mean there's a huge difference between like running a pack and like every plant's a hermey piece of shit
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:12:00.080]  And like all right, this one kind of harmed all these were great, you know, it's like okay, you know, let's just
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:03.760]  kind of what happens with breeding, you know, you gotta
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.360]  You you gotta at least kind of know how genetics work to at least
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.440]  Be like, okay
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:18.000]  Otherwise, yeah, some people like yeah, not every exact plant's the same i'm like, well, did you buy an inbred line?
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:20.240]  No, you didn't so don't know what to do
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:27.120]  Don't know what to do you're like education goes a long way. Yeah
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:36.880]  So, I don't you know, it's like you just try to be as open and honest as you can and you know, yeah sometimes people
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:40.880]  Screw up germinating seeds. Like I had one person
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.840]  They germinated seeds and on ph rockwell and I was like, well, like
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:49.600]  Did you read the directions on the rock?
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:55.760]  Uh, you know, so I saw him another pack on me, but I was just like
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:04.480]  You know, you never know what you're messing with. So a lot of people mess up or yeah, maybe the seed stock you made
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:11.920]  You know, it's been around for a hot minute and it wasn't stored necessarily how I store my seed stock
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:14.240]  and so it didn't germinate as good as
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:21.520]  If I were to germinate myself, so i'm just you know, let me know and i'll send you a new pack on me, you know
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:26.640]  Yeah, and then that's you know, very good on you and you know a lot of people
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:28.160]  um
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:31.440]  I don't think people intentionally make these mistakes, you know
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:38.640]  A lot of them are just from lack of doing it lack of knowledge lack of experience and that's absolutely fine
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:46.640]  If you are honest with you know, the breeder or whoever you stand a much better chance of getting a result that you're after
[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:49.280]  Versus just kind of like well
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:53.280]  I think your genetics are fucked up. So can I get more of them, please?
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:55.980]  for free
[02:13:56.060 --> 02:13:57.580]  Yeah
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:04.160]  If you're like, you know what I fucked up and I didn't ph my water and I just phed and it's like 8.5
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:12.300]  I totally thought would you mind? Absolutely send me your address. I'll get you a new pack. Yeah, we all do stuff
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:15.580]  I mean, I still do stuff like this sometimes so yeah
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:18.780]  It happens. They're the best
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:25.740]  I'll try to put myself in that category, but the honesty goes a lot longer way than being like your shit sucks
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:30.140]  and it hurt me and I want another pack and they're like well
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.740]  What
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:39.180]  If they didn't germinate and they were intersex, why do you want more of them?
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:43.340]  Like why didn't you just hit me? I'm saying can I get a free one instead? You're like I want a piggy bank
[02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:46.220]  All right, what's really going on here, dude?
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:53.020]  Yeah, that's where the logic escapes. I call it the clause. It just everything goes out the window. Yeah
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:57.420]  I'm poking. I'm poking. Okay, he's poking me on that. I don't know why
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:12.220]  It's okay i'll come i'll come and harass you another time
[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:18.620]  So yeah, he's been all about my mannequin tonight and I don't know why but
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:20.700]  I don't know. Let me let me give this
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:27.260]  Oh, what's Tony got? Oh, I forgot. This is another uh small time breeder olfactory genetics
[02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:32.860]  This is a homeboy a friend of mine. He's actually a guy that gave me the kim-91 that I used in breeding. Um,
[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:38.540]  Yeah, this is a blue ridge eclipse. This is my truth tree that I named after rostruth
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:41.580]  um across to tibet nog, which is a
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:43.500]  a tibetan
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:45.900]  Landrace line and this this stuff's fireman
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:51.100]  Landrace line and this this stuff's fireman. He's another good breeder. That's a small time back
[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:59.180]  I sent I sent him a lot of black conserve f1s and he him and I collabed and it was hilarious because
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:03.100]  We were in hawaii at the same time. We got to meet up. So that was cool
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:07.980]  That's related to a vashon island in washington by chance
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:14.060]  Uh for shawn island exactly but uh, I believe uh closer to the british columbia side maybe now
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:15.100]  um
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.500]  i'm counting exactly but yeah, um,
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:22.460]  Sean he's also got a band called the seed. Um, he sent me uh, quite a bit of stuff
[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:27.580]  He's got some killer afghani work. If you guys are looking for afghani, that's not the same as everybody else's
[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:30.940]  Like it's using the same repeated stuff over and over
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:33.180]  um
[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:36.700]  There's stuff from bud and lather in here that is in here from the homie manny
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:41.180]  Nice now, didn't you uh do a collab with uh, bud and lather as well?
[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:46.300]  Yeah, we did. Um, and we're about to do another one with pakalolo feeds on there
[02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:51.020]  Um, but I did one with manny through the um duck foot. Um, I named after my cousin
[02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:53.660]  apathy, uh to
[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:55.020]  It's called um
[02:16:55.020 --> 02:16:57.020]  feed of the space duck, uh
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:00.380]  Papi his special. Um
[02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:04.460]  Yeah
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:08.860]  100 packs of those to manny and he gave him out with his stuff when he was raising money for his uh,
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:14.720]  Wheelchair he also um sent packs out when the island of tonga had a tsunami
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:18.000]  People that donated there he sent out free packs to them
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:22.000]  For that if they just sent screenshots of their donation, it didn't matter what it was
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:24.720]  It could you could have said 50 cents and then he sent you seeds
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:32.400]  Oh dude, they're a good dude there. I like you know, I do like his uh soaps. He makes a lot of different products soaps chapstick
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:39.060]  Um bud and lather is the name of the company manny is the man, uh, he's been a guest on the show
[02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:44.260]  But yeah, everybody check him out. Uh if you're into, you know, some of the medicated type soaps
[02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:48.100]  And actually I want to try this chapstick I heard about he just had uh,
[02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:53.700]  Dude, that'd be crazy. That's something that would go through tsa. I think very well. Oh, yeah

[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:03.640]  Because I just gave me a fucking more than I could carry man much appreciated man and it's soap that soaps awesome
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:07.640]  It works great for ipm also for cannabis growers
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:15.080]  Source and your own stuff and if you get the ones that come with the right, uh oils added to it
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.880]  They work great for uh, twofold not just as a saponin source, but as a fucking blue
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:23.280]  Interesting
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:28.820]  Let's see here I wanna i'm gonna pop out want to pop up a couple more seeds here before
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:34.180]  We do our thing. Uh, these ones come from hillbilly herb. He actually see
[02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:36.580]  uh when I when I do the uh
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:40.740]  The home grow show on my channel. I do giveaways on on each of the shows
[02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:43.540]  And we used to like I said here we had the mr
[02:18:43.540 --> 02:18:50.900]  Magpie rule because I can't get stuff into canada, but hillbilly herb actually is my canadian guy who helps
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:54.040]  Get things out to canadians every time they win
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:56.200]  on the show
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:02.120]  They get hooked up through him. So he sent me actually a bunch of things right now and I wish I could get him to focus
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:04.280]  There we go. So
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:05.960]  freaky dreams
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:13.000]  Freak show dream lotus. We uh dream lotus i'm believing is from bode some pineapple gas times his freaky dreams
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:15.720]  uh this one
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:21.740]  I can't read it add grapefruit in it double grapefruit dream. Hayes grapefruit. Hayes, uh
[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:25.420]  Times the grapefruit. Hayes dream lotus. That sounds awesome
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:30.460]  And let's see here the which gosh, where was it?
[02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:37.660]  There we go. Is a gorilla poison. So a gg4 with a durban poison. I thought that would be interesting
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:44.220]  That that might might need to run alongside with the green crack in the durban
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:50.320]  And actually running these two side by side if I start to see some similarities I could be like well
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:54.640]  Maybe is that the durban showing up can maybe help me steer things?
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:20:03.680]  Pineapple gas who doesn't love a little bit of gas grapefruit. Hayes dream lotus and uh, zam's poison
[02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:07.760]  Zam smile, which i'm not familiar with
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:12.880]  uh, sam smile and then times his durban poison as well, but
[02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:19.060]  I'll be excited to get into these first thing i'm cracking though from hillbilly herb. I moved a sticker damn it. Um,
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:23.460]  He sent me cherry wine. It was uh, so it's hemp essentially
[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:28.420]  But I want to start playing with some of those cannabinoids and he has a very very tasty
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:33.300]  Cut so so I must say I found a very
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:36.240]  Cherry whiny
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:40.260]  and it was like it was odd when it was growing but then when I like
[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:45.240]  Put it in the jars and as it cured out over a month month and a half
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:50.040]  Like it developed a heavy wine cherry wine flavor
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:53.400]  was the mother to my um
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:58.600]  It's called louise limes. It's a king louis. Um
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:04.440]  It's a king louis bx2 from pink house genetics based in denver
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:06.920]  He sent we did a trade
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:14.940]  And I found a male in that that was super heavy cherry flavor and I hit that back to king louis
[02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:17.260]  clone only
[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:18.060]  um
[02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:20.060]  And so that's the louise limes
[02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:27.340]  Uh that line I I can send you a pack of that to hunt through that and try to find something in that kind of pedigree
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:29.420]  um
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:30.780]  but uh
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:38.320]  But uh, I will say I will ship all over the world I ship to the uk I ship to guam i've shipped to
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:41.520]  Australia, I got an order to australia actually
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:44.120]  scotland
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:46.120]  Canada all the time
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:48.400]  all the way down to chile
[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:50.120]  um

[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:10.340]  Right and again remember look for if the link is the proper link is down in the show notes everybody
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:17.620]  But the spelling a little bit different main accounts, you know, sometimes they get taken down. So i've had three accounts
[02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:19.380]  Yeah
[02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:20.340]  Yeah
[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:21.380]  Yeah
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:26.840]  Do you want to actually you you recently had an auction now our auctions tell maybe tell people
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:32.040]  About like what what is an auction? How does it work? And maybe you know
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:35.240]  What what are some of the things that they can score and how often do you do those?
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:38.840]  So I tend to do auctions pretty
[02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:41.960]  Often at least once a month or so
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:43.780]  um
[02:22:43.780 --> 02:22:48.520]  Sometimes life just likes to take me through a cornfield backwards
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:51.320]  um
[02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:54.300]  Oh lord, man
[02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:56.460]  I did not see that coming
[02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:58.780]  Oh
[02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:02.700]  I'll tell you what. I mean last year I had to get it
[02:23:03.740 --> 02:23:07.980]  I had to get a new engine for my truck. I tried selling my truck
[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:12.140]  I we had to get a new transmission for my wife's car
[02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:19.740]  Uh recently I had to get a hematoma blood in my dog's ear. It was swelling up extremely bad
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:22.240]  I almost thought we were gonna have to get her ear amputated
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:30.560]  Um, I had to go to water pump dom on the new engine because it's actually like a used engine from pennsylvania
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:35.840]  the salt from pennsylvania like rest like ate out the seal and
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.680]  Thank yeah, so thankfully I have a mechanic
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:46.480]  That like he put in the engine for a good amount and he was able to like work with me on paying him
[02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:49.380]  And on a good deal and whatnot, so
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:56.100]  Anyways, I do auctions for me. I do auctions for like my grandparents. We're having a rough time
[02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:58.660]  I'll do it for friends. Like I just
[02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:01.300]  I have so many seeds
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:06.180]  I can get seeds to people for a very good price
[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:12.580]  like so I try to you know, i'll go through my seed bank and pull out some stuff and
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:20.440]  List it for relatively cheap and just kind of let people decide from there, you know, um
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:28.600]  You know, i'm open to international shipping. So everybody's welcome to bid. You just gotta pay the shipping costs
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:31.000]  um
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.600]  Yeah, uh
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:40.200]  Generally, you can get stuff that's as rare as you know extras that I have from stuff. I was gifted to be tested
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.780]  Whether it's from like mean gene or other breeders
[02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:50.700]  um, or you might get a pack of my black line reserve f3s for like
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:57.020]  $60.80 to where they go for a lot more on seed site. So it just
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:00.540]  it depends on like what it's for and
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:05.340]  what i've kind of selected through my seed bank at the time, but
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.280]  You can definitely pick up some killer gear for a killer price
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:14.720]  uh, and I ship everywhere so
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:18.720]  I like your you know, you're kind of what we're saying. Um
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:24.240]  Earlier before we went live as you're just like, you know, it's like I want them to be popped. Hey
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:27.840]  Hey
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  Good to see you
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:32.560]  um, it's uh
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:37.920]  It's good to uh, you get those get those seeds pops, you know, it's it's a
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:43.780]  Problem to have you yeah more than you can handle and you're you know, you obviously store them
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:47.060]  well six years later had good germination rate, but
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:53.780]  It's still exciting to get them into people's hands. Like you said, you know, you're like I really like that one
[02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:58.500]  You know what? I want you to get these I want you to pop them because you're gonna pop them sooner than me
[02:25:58.580 --> 02:26:01.300]  So it's it's it's a good feeling too
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.520]  To see these things get popped. Yeah, that's cool. Exactly
[02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:08.040]  Exactly, and it's like dude. I you know
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:15.320]  the amount the amount of seats I have versus the amount of space I have versus the amount of lifetime I have just as
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:19.720]  Exactly that equation man. Yeah
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:23.560]  Yeah
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:29.080]  Mr. Toad's getting getting back with us here. But uh, I I kind of uh,
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:32.860]  Fumbled the clip a little bit earlier. We're talking about, you know plants
[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:40.060]  You know see plants and see the things that are similar and make sure they look alike and
[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:42.940]  Sometimes that happens with human and I had something
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:45.560]  Interesting like that happened to me lately
[02:26:51.970 --> 02:26:55.170]  Like hey, man, I should get a heads up before y'all read. Yeah
[02:26:55.730 --> 02:27:01.170]  Uh, i'm brad. That's a the name dusty stole his look from chad westport. All right
[02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:03.190]  What
[02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:05.670]  Well, do you know him dusty I don't know him
[02:27:06.470 --> 02:27:09.270]  You got a pretty similar vibe. Yeah, we got a similar vibe
[02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:14.070]  I did I have a video on youtube that I did of all the people that people say I look like I don't know
[02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:18.150]  If I included chad westport, is there is there one? That's the most common
[02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:23.990]  Uh, yeah, well hardy not not so much people say david cross all the time
[02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:27.830]  They say david cross with forrest gump with laura stump. I get that one
[02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:29.510]  uh
[02:27:29.530 --> 02:27:35.050]  Yeah, I don't see david cross but they always say that david's got that they say david cross in disguise
[02:27:35.210 --> 02:27:40.330]  It's like your face. I actually get jimmy fallon in disguise a lot. Yeah get um
[02:27:41.050 --> 02:27:43.050]  So you gave yourself that one? Yeah
[02:27:43.770 --> 02:27:45.770]  Uh, brad
[02:27:47.930 --> 02:27:49.930]  So
[02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:56.250]  Now we both got shout outs on real fucking podcast besides cannabis ones awesome
[02:27:56.890 --> 02:27:58.890]  Yeah
[02:27:58.990 --> 02:28:03.870]  Yeah, they are they are some pretty uh popular comedians i've taken it
[02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:06.910]  And uh, I guess I guess
[02:28:07.310 --> 02:28:12.830]  I guess I see it too. I like the way he said he looked uh, he gets confused for forrest gump with long hair
[02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:21.710]  But yeah, you mr toad you actually were on uh, was it brennan's job show
[02:28:22.510 --> 02:28:25.710]  It was the king of the sting and shit. Uh episode 10
[02:28:26.290 --> 02:28:31.570]  Uh, like minute 45 or something there they do a segment called, uh, joke my smoke
[02:28:32.210 --> 02:28:35.170]  And it didn't go off on me. I'm the weed leprechaun
[02:28:35.970 --> 02:28:40.530]  It was hilarious. I still remember the picture just the big like smoke coming out the nose
[02:28:42.130 --> 02:28:44.690]  Dabbing it was awesome, bro
[02:28:46.290 --> 02:28:50.450]  You gotta post that back up on your instagram again soon, you know, I could put it back up there
[02:28:51.430 --> 02:28:53.430]  Yeah
[02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:59.910]  Most people brandon shop. I know him as the usc fighter, but he's freaking like super popular podcast. Yeah
[02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:01.910]  Yeah
[02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:03.910]  Him and theo roast my ass on that show
[02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:10.150]  That was awesome, I definitely saw the shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:13.110]  Yeah, he's funny. Yeah, he is
[02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:18.150]  So are you gonna appear on rogan's show next uh
[02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:23.190]  No, hell no
[02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:29.750]  That would be funny as shit though, yeah get elon musk to take a dab he already did right man
[02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:32.310]  gang
[02:29:32.310 --> 02:29:38.710]  so so I guess what maybe I guess one question is within your own lines or
[02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:41.830]  Other breeders you can go either way with it
[02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:47.750]  For people who do like concentrates for people who are like, I don't even smoke the flower man
[02:29:48.570 --> 02:29:53.690]  What what would be maybe a good one that you recommend or is there a a breeder?
[02:29:54.170 --> 02:29:59.770]  Uh that you've had some success with i'm a flower power guy. So I do not yeah, i'm a flower
[02:30:01.050 --> 02:30:06.490]  I'm like, I don't care. Yeah, i've never got into that. It wasn't for me. It's more about selection
[02:30:06.570 --> 02:30:09.450]  I have never found one line that did just one thing
[02:30:10.010 --> 02:30:13.610]  If you run enough of those seeds, you're gonna find both sides of everything in there
[02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:17.790]  You're gonna find a dumper you're gonna find a washer you're gonna find something behind turf beans
[02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:23.390]  You're gonna be something that's great for growing and smoking. There's gonna be some bandwagon speed in that shit, too
[02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:30.750]  so like uh, I would I wouldn't drop almost any of my lines and tell you that that one specifically is for this or
[02:30:30.990 --> 02:30:35.150]  For that washing wise, right? I used to wash bubble hash all the time
[02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:40.110]  so for me the numbers I know are completely different than today's numbers because they're
[02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:44.610]  They're turning that bubble hash into a pressed concentrate
[02:30:45.250 --> 02:30:49.570]  And it has a whole different number set that they use to even get to that form
[02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:52.770]  So for me, it just comes to get enough of those seeds
[02:30:53.410 --> 02:30:58.690]  150 or 100 of them you'll find that plan in there if you know what you're looking for. Um for real
[02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:02.290]  Um
[02:31:02.290 --> 02:31:04.290]  personally, I have to say
[02:31:04.310 --> 02:31:12.230]  My line breath reserve lime sculpina has proven to be a great washer and presser as far as rosin goes
[02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.910]  uh
[02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:20.950]  one thing jackson and I have like discussed is like the terpene durability as far as
[02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:24.550]  like the when you cure out
[02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:31.190]  a cultivar and how long it can preserve its turps versus like
[02:31:31.690 --> 02:31:36.730]  other cultivars that it kind of sputters out after six months or this that the other or
[02:31:37.450 --> 02:31:40.170]  ones that press really great and you know
[02:31:41.210 --> 02:31:44.730]  They smell exactly like they did as a rosin
[02:31:45.370 --> 02:31:47.370]  As when they were a flower
[02:31:48.010 --> 02:31:52.810]  um, so I feel like lime breath reserve my lamb skunk cut is pros has
[02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:58.970]  Definitely been one that like you can press it out and it dabs out like it smokes and flour
[02:31:59.630 --> 02:32:02.030]  Um, I do want to get the terpene
[02:32:03.070 --> 02:32:04.250]  uh
[02:32:04.250 --> 02:32:06.250]  content on it, uh
[02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:07.690]  like
[02:32:07.690 --> 02:32:10.510]  tested, uh, my buddy in missouri took
[02:32:11.230 --> 02:32:13.470]  some of uh his flower and
[02:32:14.110 --> 02:32:16.190]  And had it tested and it was
[02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:18.910]  I think in like the 24
[02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:21.150]  uh range
[02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:23.950]  And it was high like linalool
[02:32:24.690 --> 02:32:26.690]  Or not linalool but carolothelene
[02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:29.730]  And a few other ones
[02:32:30.770 --> 02:32:36.930]  That I can't necessarily think of off the top of my head, but it was definitely one that I wasn't like expecting
[02:32:37.730 --> 02:32:39.410]  and so
[02:32:39.410 --> 02:32:45.090]  I would definitely be interested in like have it tested from like me growing it as well
[02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:47.170]  um
[02:32:47.170 --> 02:32:50.450]  So that's one thing I do plan to do here soon
[02:32:51.170 --> 02:32:52.530]  um
[02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:59.270]  But so far the mix between the meat breath number five and the black lime reserve
[02:33:00.310 --> 02:33:02.310]  five and six males
[02:33:02.310 --> 02:33:04.310]  have proven to be
[02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:06.390]  very
[02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:07.830]  good at
[02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:09.830]  like creating that
[02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:14.390]  Like sandy resin head texture that washes very well
[02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:21.510]  And it creates a nice cuticle to preserve the terpenes inside of that head so it doesn't necessarily break
[02:33:22.010 --> 02:33:24.010]  Yes, yeah
[02:33:25.050 --> 02:33:28.330]  Meat breath five. There we go. Yes, sir. That's it
[02:33:29.130 --> 02:33:30.330]  so
[02:33:30.330 --> 02:33:32.970]  Ka boom, so I got f1s f2
[02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:35.530]  back cross number ones
[02:33:35.930 --> 02:33:40.490]  um, like that's like my main line like what i've known for so
[02:33:41.050 --> 02:33:44.090]  I will constantly be working that line pretty heavy
[02:33:44.970 --> 02:33:46.570]  um
[02:33:46.570 --> 02:33:48.570]  excuse me, uh, so
[02:33:49.470 --> 02:33:53.870]  So that's yeah, you can definitely expect a lot of really
[02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:58.590]  Funk from that line and I gotta say like
[02:33:59.390 --> 02:34:00.190]  the
[02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:04.510]  There there's been when I ran that last whole room of them
[02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:06.430]  um
[02:34:06.430 --> 02:34:11.950]  You know, I was carrying out that like crop and then I ran a whole nother crop and I like
[02:34:12.750 --> 02:34:13.870]  gave
[02:34:13.890 --> 02:34:15.650]  You know a quarter
[02:34:15.650 --> 02:34:19.490]  Of each to a friend and had him. He was like super stoked
[02:34:19.570 --> 02:34:22.210]  He's like, oh dude, i'm gonna have like a little cannabis cup
[02:34:22.610 --> 02:34:28.290]  And he came he came back and he was like dude that lime breath reserve was like the shit
[02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:32.690]  So I was like wow, you know, and that wasn't even the main keeper fee
[02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:38.370]  He would that was just like a room full of like, I don't know. I think I kept like
[02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:40.990]  23 females out of that room
[02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:44.450]  Um out of like 75 plants or so
[02:34:45.170 --> 02:34:50.770]  So when I when I try to do bigger runs, you know, I try to shoot for 100-ish plants
[02:34:50.850 --> 02:34:54.930]  Like I don't have a huge facility, but I have a little bit of room, you know
[02:34:55.890 --> 02:34:57.890]  so I I try to
[02:34:58.450 --> 02:35:04.610]  Only keep the best of the absolute best and everything else like it may be good
[02:35:04.850 --> 02:35:09.650]  But if it's not the top of the top, it's not sticking around
[02:35:10.470 --> 02:35:17.110]  So that's where I try to try to create genetics that you don't need to pop very many of them to find
[02:35:17.650 --> 02:35:19.250]  absolute fire
[02:35:19.250 --> 02:35:26.610]  That's uh, that's a heaven sent for the consumer man. I mean that is amazing and I have had experiences where i've popped
[02:35:27.250 --> 02:35:31.410]  Half of a 10 pack and I had a couple three just like
[02:35:32.050 --> 02:35:36.290]  Wow, this is blowing me away. You're making you definitely make it to the next round
[02:35:36.930 --> 02:35:40.850]  And that's you know, that's kind of like my thing this year is i'm excited to
[02:35:41.650 --> 02:35:46.690]  Start working through more stuff. Like I got rid of everything except two two of my keepers
[02:35:47.010 --> 02:35:49.010]  And actually now i've got an akatomi plaza
[02:35:49.010 --> 02:35:52.370]  But i'll probably get rid of that because I have a lot more to go through. I just popped one
[02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:54.370]  That was a little bit unique. I'm like
[02:35:55.010 --> 02:35:58.930]  Okay, i'll play with it. But again now so this year is like I really am
[02:35:58.930 --> 02:36:04.370]  I'm trying to go through things and and be that selective because there is there's there's a lot of fire out there
[02:36:05.010 --> 02:36:06.930]  But you want that like
[02:36:06.930 --> 02:36:12.870]  Fire that's ice too, you know, it's like the best man. Yeah, it's like you would be devastated
[02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:17.190]  If you've lost this it couldn't smoke this tomorrow. Yeah, like exactly
[02:36:17.970 --> 02:36:22.770]  You like dude when I when I talk about like I selected through
[02:36:23.730 --> 02:36:26.390]  It was a star killer to dog walker ogf2
[02:36:27.490 --> 02:36:29.490]  And it was a number 23
[02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:31.570]  And dude this thing
[02:36:31.570 --> 02:36:38.130]  I call it the dome crusher phenom because how many people I let smoke it. They're just like dude, I like
[02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:40.850]  Yeah, I just passed out on the couch
[02:36:41.330 --> 02:36:45.590]  Couldn't make it to my room. Like dude, it just wrecked me like tkl
[02:36:46.290 --> 02:36:50.690]  And it's one of my absolute favorites and it's just like that
[02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:53.150]  fuely
[02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:54.450]  metallic
[02:36:54.450 --> 02:36:55.570]  like
[02:36:55.570 --> 02:36:56.850]  dank
[02:36:56.850 --> 02:37:02.150]  Oh, I don't know dude it knocked out like san fernando. I got san fernando
[02:37:03.090 --> 02:37:05.650]  Uh dog walker the original clone
[02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:08.770]  Uh, I went through a bunch of just pure
[02:37:09.490 --> 02:37:15.010]  Like a clone only ogs and i'm like dude. No this one out beats them all
[02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:21.730]  So it it just goes to show that you can play. Yeah, everyone
[02:37:22.210 --> 02:37:25.570]  Can hold old genetics, but I guarantee what man
[02:37:26.210 --> 02:37:32.050]  If you mix some of the right ones together, you can find stuff even better
[02:37:32.770 --> 02:37:34.130]  Not gonna lie
[02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:38.690]  So as much as as much as you want to brag to me you got this cut that cut
[02:37:39.170 --> 02:37:46.690]  I can tell you you take this cut that cut mix them together. You're probably gonna find something way better
[02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:50.130]  So don't be afraid to pop beans. Don't
[02:37:50.370 --> 02:37:55.490]  Like there's so many people i've argued with oh my god, this cuts the best and i'm like
[02:37:56.130 --> 02:38:00.050]  I can send you something that'll probably put that one to shame. So
[02:38:01.090 --> 02:38:03.090]  And the only way to really find these is
[02:38:03.730 --> 02:38:06.770]  Popping beans. That's the only way you're gonna find something new
[02:38:07.330 --> 02:38:10.690]  And I was like I would like to give a shout out to one of my homies
[02:38:11.010 --> 02:38:14.610]  His name on the ig is only popping beans
[02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:21.110]  Beans and he go he's a very big banana terpene selector
[02:38:21.810 --> 02:38:25.750]  uh, he created a cultivar called banana chiquita
[02:38:26.610 --> 02:38:27.650]  and
[02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:29.570]  so far that's just
[02:38:29.570 --> 02:38:37.250]  Everyone that's ran that has just been dumbfounded by the banana terpenes that have come off his lines
[02:38:37.810 --> 02:38:44.610]  So if if there's anyone i'd like to shout out tonight that's not meant necessarily known about it would be
[02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:47.170]  only popping beans
[02:38:47.170 --> 02:38:49.730]  Aka look for his banana lines
[02:38:50.370 --> 02:38:54.870]  Now are we talking are we talking banana fruit? Are we talking banana? Laffy taffy?
[02:38:55.470 --> 02:38:57.970]  banana like laffy taffy banana
[02:38:58.450 --> 02:39:00.290]  That's the banana
[02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:05.810]  Yeah, mostly good. But yeah, he's working heavy like banana like bubble gum
[02:39:05.970 --> 02:39:12.530]  Like that's why I named it banana chiquita. Like yeah banana laffy tap. Like yeah, like yeah
[02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:19.570]  Like he he's sent it off and had people and facilities grow it and the tremors be like dude the banana like
[02:39:20.370 --> 02:39:22.370]  That cut is insane
[02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:27.970]  So if it's like I want to shout out a slept on person. It'll be that homie right now
[02:39:28.690 --> 02:39:33.970]  Well, that's a good good time to do that. We should probably wrap it up here. It's going on
[02:39:34.690 --> 02:39:35.490]  Yeah
[02:39:35.490 --> 02:39:40.690]  Two hours 45 minutes dude, thank you so much for giving the time when I said it would be like an hour or two
[02:39:40.930 --> 02:39:42.930]  So absolutely brother
[02:39:43.330 --> 02:39:45.490]  The extra credit the extra effort man

[02:40:05.170 --> 02:40:07.810]  That you're like man I wanted to break this one out tonight
[02:40:08.530 --> 02:40:14.290]  You know, I mean i'm just really excited about this black line reserve f3 and backcross number one
[02:40:15.010 --> 02:40:17.010]  um that I just recently kind of
[02:40:17.650 --> 02:40:19.570]  done, um, there's a
[02:40:19.570 --> 02:40:21.650]  Lot of dank freebies that I sent

[02:40:52.370 --> 02:40:58.130]  Testers for some gmo og cross to the black line reserve f3 sour lime pine wine
[02:40:58.690 --> 02:41:00.690]  Um, so if you guys listen up
[02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:03.510]  Yeah, so if you got some free space immediately

[02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:32.370]  Toad, I appreciate that we were kind of just uh wrapping things up though, but I definitely don't want to sell you short here
[02:41:32.690 --> 02:41:33.890]  so
[02:41:33.890 --> 02:41:38.210]  Is there was there any packs that you wanted to uh, you know show off tonight that we didn't mention
[02:41:38.530 --> 02:41:40.930]  Or anybody that you wanted to shout out to?
[02:41:41.650 --> 02:41:45.250]  Um, well, um, man, if I move to show you some packs, it's just gonna go out
[02:41:45.330 --> 02:41:47.330]  I'm sitting in a hot spot right here. I think
[02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:49.250]  I'll let you again
[02:41:49.250 --> 02:41:51.250]  Shouts out uh breeder wise man. Uh
[02:41:52.050 --> 02:41:58.130]  Man, there's some killer guys out there. Like I said nick of uh, uh limerising farm. He's got some killer stuff. That's out
[02:41:58.210 --> 02:42:04.770]  Uh again, my buddy from uh elephant and seed supply. He has some killer stuff. That's a small batch
[02:42:04.850 --> 02:42:09.190]  It's not going to be anything that everybody has but it's killer selection
[02:42:09.810 --> 02:42:10.850]  um
[02:42:10.850 --> 02:42:14.530]  My buddy pistol positive same thing. He puts passion him and um,
[02:42:15.010 --> 02:42:20.450]  And uh, jason together the pistol brothers those guys are putting together some killer stuff I feel
[02:42:20.930 --> 02:42:24.770]  Um, that isn't the same as everybody else's that's what makes them different
[02:42:25.330 --> 02:42:26.290]  um
[02:42:26.290 --> 02:42:28.290]  Other than that on my own stuff. Uh
[02:42:28.930 --> 02:42:32.450]  This weekend. I just like to say we got the test show coming up on saturday
[02:42:33.090 --> 02:42:39.890]  Uh, it's the boneyard seed test groups for the number one one one two two twos and three three three groups
[02:42:40.370 --> 02:42:47.090]  So no no names people are no there are there's kim 91 crossed the mud bone the uh, kim four crossed the mud bone
[02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:49.010]  and the uh
[02:42:49.010 --> 02:42:52.690]  What's the man? I can't remember the third one cherry pie crossed the mud bone
[02:42:53.170 --> 02:42:58.290]  Plus there's a bunch of other stuff out there that I sent out. I sent some stuff with the gmo crossed the mud bone
[02:42:58.930 --> 02:42:59.810]  um
[02:42:59.810 --> 02:43:04.530]  I sent a whole bunch of mud bone crosses out really so there's a lot of people that might show up in there anyone that
[02:43:04.610 --> 02:43:06.610]  is growing any of the test stuff or
[02:43:07.010 --> 02:43:11.410]  Is growing any of the new recent mud bone crosses feel free to jump in on that night
[02:43:11.570 --> 02:43:14.690]  Uh, there'll be a spot for anyone that wants to show up for a minute or two at all
[02:43:15.090 --> 02:43:19.330]  That is badass man. And that mud bone is kind of one of your more
[02:43:19.810 --> 02:43:20.830]  uh
[02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:26.450]  Medicinal strains that you've worked with. Yeah, that's a plant I ran with for a long time. It's a cross of the uh,
[02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:31.490]  bubble cush and my angel male, um, I made that plant in
[02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:36.530]  2008 it's a one that I hold near and dear. Like I said, the bubble cush is something
[02:43:37.010 --> 02:43:40.450]  I I still have in my garden. I'm pushing 18 years now with bubble cush
[02:43:41.010 --> 02:43:44.850]  Um, I love that plant. It has great qualities for uh eating
[02:43:45.550 --> 02:43:46.450]  sleeping
[02:43:46.450 --> 02:43:50.210]  Uh a lot of ptsd issues. Um, I love that plant
[02:43:50.290 --> 02:43:53.250]  She's something that i've had for a long time and I hope to hold for a while
[02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:58.290]  I've done above a back cross the mud bone itself, which is above a cross. Um
[02:43:58.930 --> 02:44:04.530]  I just did the ghost of bubba which is the ghost og back cross one across the bubba. Um,
[02:44:05.250 --> 02:44:11.330]  uh, I want to do a reverse cross the bubba but just for some personal stuff nothing that I would release because like
[02:44:11.650 --> 02:44:14.210]  two dogs just dropped a whole bunch of bubble crosses and
[02:44:14.610 --> 02:44:19.330]  I feel like making some of the same stuff and trying to battle someone for fucking
[02:44:19.890 --> 02:44:23.170]  Uh recognition or for seed sales. It's just not my kind of thing
[02:44:23.250 --> 02:44:26.210]  So i'd rather just say hit homeboy up because he's got him
[02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:30.290]  And then try to hit me up or something that I might be doing in the future
[02:44:30.690 --> 02:44:34.450]  Yeah, and who knows you might you know, you might find something for yourself in there that you're like
[02:44:34.530 --> 02:44:36.930]  Well, I want to work with this. I want to take another direction
[02:44:36.930 --> 02:44:42.050]  I want to cross it with that or even back cross it and solidify what you like most about it. So
[02:44:43.810 --> 02:44:50.210]  Yeah, I respect to that though I get that and because that is kind of one of the interesting things too that people don't
[02:44:50.690 --> 02:44:51.570]  um
[02:44:51.570 --> 02:44:55.170]  well, I don't think people necessarily appreciate it sometimes it's like
[02:44:55.810 --> 02:44:57.010]  you know
[02:44:57.010 --> 02:45:04.290]  We all could have the same pack of seeds and we can all cross it with another same pack of seeds
[02:45:04.530 --> 02:45:06.690]  But we don't all get the same
[02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:10.110]  progeny from it, so
[02:45:10.930 --> 02:45:15.730]  You know, even though even though you do have some of the same things sometimes it's like the special cut or the direction
[02:45:15.810 --> 02:45:17.810]  Just the genetics that got passed
[02:45:17.970 --> 02:45:18.770]  so
[02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:24.850]  Well, and that the one thing i've seen really quickly is the people everyone's different
[02:45:25.490 --> 02:45:26.750]  like
[02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:31.090]  preferences and how everyone perceives terpenes differently
[02:45:31.570 --> 02:45:37.010]  Like when that one night at the seed event that I had a bunch of people smell land breath reserve
[02:45:37.650 --> 02:45:39.090]  to see
[02:45:39.090 --> 02:45:41.410]  how many different perceive
[02:45:42.370 --> 02:45:44.370]  many people
[02:45:44.610 --> 02:45:51.250]  Perceive the same strain differently. They're like, oh, this is fruitier. Oh, this is skunkier all this you're just like
[02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:53.650]  What?
[02:45:53.650 --> 02:45:59.970]  Wow, so it's incredible just to see how cannabis reacts on everyone's palette and
[02:46:00.610 --> 02:46:07.490]  How it affects everyone differently just how it gets everyone high differently in a sense. So true. So true
[02:46:07.810 --> 02:46:09.810]  Yeah, well said
[02:46:10.770 --> 02:46:14.210]  That's how I've been above I want yeah that was and you know
[02:46:15.570 --> 02:46:19.650]  As far as my body goes and stuff tony, you know, you're on to it too. It's like bubba
[02:46:20.370 --> 02:46:23.970]  Kush, the katsu kush the burmese kush those all three of those
[02:46:24.690 --> 02:46:30.770]  My body my stomach medicinally react to them like those help calm things down and yeah
[02:46:31.170 --> 02:46:33.170]  Yeah, so good strains
[02:46:33.170 --> 02:46:36.610]  Yep, for real they they work and it's not just because
[02:46:37.170 --> 02:46:39.890]  But I didn't make them so I can't say it's any of that shit
[02:46:39.890 --> 02:46:42.850]  It's just that without a name it would still work like that
[02:46:43.730 --> 02:46:49.010]  It does work and that's you only learn that through either having an issue knowing something that has the issue
[02:46:49.410 --> 02:46:51.490]  Or experience with enough people that did
[02:46:52.130 --> 02:46:56.610]  That's how I learned about it. And like you saying you found them through your own pain relief
[02:46:57.410 --> 02:47:02.850]  I found it through a lot of veterans and people with cancer myself. Um, but for me it was uh,
[02:47:03.810 --> 02:47:04.850]  I like
[02:47:04.850 --> 02:47:12.290]  Plants that they call og like sfv pyro g tau o g my mom in the early days. She loved romulan and blue dream
[02:47:12.930 --> 02:47:15.890]  Like plants that I wouldn't have selected myself for smoking
[02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:21.410]  But my mom like that's all she went to and that's why she says I want you to make a cross of these so
[02:47:21.810 --> 02:47:23.810]  I ended up finding
[02:47:24.130 --> 02:47:29.410]  the cataract kush from dna cross that into both of those lines to end up making stuff that for
[02:47:29.970 --> 02:47:37.250]  Myself ended up working on my own selection and through the uh, like blood sweat and tears and that I made with the blue dream
[02:47:37.810 --> 02:47:43.890]  Worked for my mom. So like you can find stuff from everybody in the same seed lines if you just do enough selection
[02:47:45.810 --> 02:47:46.850]  Well
[02:47:46.850 --> 02:47:50.530]  Keep buying seeds and keep popping them out there everybody
[02:47:51.970 --> 02:47:58.850]  Keep popping. I like wheezing in the juice here. She's happy fun thing, which hopefully isn't like young people slaying
[02:47:58.850 --> 02:48:03.570]  I don't understand but i'm gonna interpret it to mean happy pheno hunting. So
[02:48:04.290 --> 02:48:09.330]  Happy fun thing everybody. I think we'll go with that unless you guys got any last words
[02:48:10.130 --> 02:48:11.490]  That'll be good
[02:48:11.490 --> 02:48:13.490]  And let's let you lucas good
[02:48:13.650 --> 02:48:20.130]  Good to see you brother and uh, thanks chad for fucking putting me and him back together again. I always love talking to my brother
[02:48:21.390 --> 02:48:27.090]  Absolutely same brother. You guys have a wonderful night. It was great spending time with you guys
