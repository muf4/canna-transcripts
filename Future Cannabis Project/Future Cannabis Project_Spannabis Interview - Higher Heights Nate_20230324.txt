[00:00.000 --> 00:04.920]  I've been slowly trying to get there and my hair was at the bottom of my back
[00:04.920 --> 00:12.920]  when I locked it up. Really? Yes. That takes a long time. Well this is awesome. I love
[00:12.920 --> 00:16.320]  running into people that are part of our community in California all the way out
[00:16.320 --> 00:19.600]  in fucking Spain. Had to make it happen. And you said and you speak to me like a
[00:19.600 --> 00:25.800]  veteran. I'm like no this guy is a window seat. So I mean you know Peter if you're into the cannabis project.
[00:25.800 --> 00:29.480]  Tell us a little bit about you, your farm, where you're located. Absolutely yeah for
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.800]  sure. You know we're in Mendocino. We're the western part of the county so it's
[00:33.800 --> 00:38.360]  a really beautiful climate there. I call it the Terp Belt. We get some fog from
[00:38.360 --> 00:42.280]  the ocean but we have the hot inland weather as well. So we kind of ride that
[00:42.280 --> 00:46.960]  line between the two climates that exist in Mando. The more harsh dry inland with
[00:46.960 --> 00:51.560]  tons of Sun and the wetter more gentle coastal conditions. So we kind of hit
[00:51.560 --> 00:55.440]  that little sweet spot like I say the Terp Belt. So this is an image of my
[00:55.440 --> 00:59.480]  outdoor garden that we run in Conchie. I run two different gardens. One is the
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.080]  outdoor farm and the other one is a light depth cultivation and I have a
[01:03.080 --> 01:07.080]  nursery as well. So I kind of I hold all three of the main permits in
[01:07.080 --> 01:10.440]  California right now. Yeah so we're doing a bunch of breeding work and I'm always
[01:10.440 --> 01:13.600]  trying to move that forward and you know being here at Spanibus has been a real
[01:13.600 --> 01:17.560]  blessing. Like it's amazing seeing the rest of the world open up. You know I
[01:17.560 --> 01:22.880]  talked to people from I think probably over 30 countries at this point. Big up
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.040]  Cape Verde Islands. Yo I probably have met 25 people from Cape Verde. Really?
[01:27.040 --> 01:31.120]  Yeah and they're all buying my seeds. It's great. That's got to be the next
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.640]  spot is to go visit Cape Verde. But you know just really seeing people get the
[01:35.640 --> 01:39.760]  freedom to work with the plant and change the culture in their countries
[01:39.760 --> 01:45.280]  from prohibition to understanding how valuable cannabis is to human beings in
[01:45.280 --> 01:49.200]  general. It's really a joy to watch that go down and just to be a part of that.
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.160]  I've met so many people this weekend that are like well we can grow but we
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.760]  have garbage genetics and so we're just trying to get somewhere where we can get
[01:56.760 --> 02:00.920]  like improve our quality and improve what we're putting out. And it's really
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.760]  you know a great thing just to see that progression of cannabis you know
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.840]  worldwide because it's been so limited for so long. It's been so underground for
[02:09.840 --> 02:14.120]  so long. Now we're at a place where really it's clearly opening up so much.
[02:14.120 --> 02:17.960]  So I'm thankful to be a part of that. I've been doing this for 25 years and
[02:17.960 --> 02:21.280]  you know to watch the progression that's happened throughout that time is
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.280]  really exciting. And to be here in Spain and sharing with the international
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.560]  cannabis community. Pretty special. It's awesome man. It looks like I'm like
[02:30.560 --> 02:33.520]  looking at your farm. It doesn't look like you're throwing a bunch of salt in your
[02:33.520 --> 02:36.800]  soil. No sir. What are you growing? How are you growing? Strictly organic is how we
[02:36.800 --> 02:41.720]  approach everything that we do. So this this farm is all in the ground. It's been
[02:41.720 --> 02:47.920]  a Prop 215 garden before it was a Prop 64 garden. So the soils been building for
[02:47.920 --> 02:51.880]  like almost 20 years at this farm. So you know the results we get over there. I
[02:51.880 --> 02:56.960]  don't use barely any food. We might feed fish a little bit of liquid nutrients
[02:56.960 --> 03:02.000]  maybe twice at the beginning of flower and then nothing else. And I get you know
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  my recent crop was that's being sold at Soulful in San Francisco hit 4.5
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.400]  curves. So we get an extra level of turps from growing that way. And I've been
[03:12.400 --> 03:15.920]  trying to explain to people all weekend. Too much food you're not gonna get the
[03:15.920 --> 03:20.320]  flavor. You get lazy fucking plants. And people are too focused on yield. It's not
[03:20.320 --> 03:23.520]  about quality for a lot of people. Their whole focus is oh I need to pull
[03:23.520 --> 03:28.960]  weight. That's also true. So cultivation for me has always been
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.760]  organic. I started growing because I wanted high grade in my jar. It wasn't
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.720]  about making money. It was about I need I need some good reason. We're doing it for you and
[03:36.720 --> 03:40.640]  you do it anyways. I try to maintain that as it goes because it's
[03:40.640 --> 03:44.280]  challenging. You know I mean the industry is very difficult these days. California
[03:44.360 --> 03:47.640]  pretty much just want to strangle us all. Yeah. And see if they can get a little
[03:47.640 --> 03:52.520]  more money off of me before I die. So yeah we need to figure out how to overcome that.
[03:52.520 --> 03:57.000]  And quality is kind of the only way. So I always like to round these out with
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.520]  it with the big well two big points. First question is you're successful. You
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.160]  have LightDep. You're doing outdoor. You have farms. You're out here in Spain. You have your
[04:05.160 --> 04:09.160]  breeding projects going. This is amazing stuff. There's a lot of people that are
[04:09.160 --> 04:12.440]  in it right now and they're trying to get to where you
[04:12.440 --> 04:15.440]  are. They might be on the first couple steps and they're having challenges. What
[04:15.440 --> 04:19.720]  would you say to those farmers if it was you at that point in time to get through
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.480]  that moment. What do you think? What would you say to them? I mean I might look good
[04:23.480 --> 04:26.960]  right now. I'm trying to tell you I'm barely surviving financially in
[04:26.960 --> 04:32.480]  California these days. And so the reality is this is the advice I give myself that
[04:32.480 --> 04:37.960]  I would give anybody is focus on quality. Everything that you do has to be about
[04:37.960 --> 04:43.560]  quality. Figure out how to not cut corners where it comes to quality. That's
[04:43.560 --> 04:49.840]  the end product that you are producing. It has to be a good product. So to me it
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.960]  sounds cliche but straight up focus on your craft. Get back to the roots of what
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.000]  brought you into it. Remember what brought you into it and get back
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.520]  straight to that point. Be like nah I don't like all this hype shit. I'm gonna
[05:04.520 --> 05:08.920]  grow something brand new. I'm gonna make my own seeds. I'm gonna focus on pulling
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.320]  high-grade. I'm gonna figure out how to make a hash product that other people
[05:12.320 --> 05:15.800]  don't have. I'm gonna figure out how to start breeding and make something really
[05:15.800 --> 05:20.600]  cool and new. So you know you have to be creative in this time. You have to really
[05:20.600 --> 05:26.360]  be focused on quality and differentiating yourself from the sort
[05:26.360 --> 05:32.800]  of big mass of the myths that exist. Yeah the mess of the myths. Rise above the myths is the
[05:33.280 --> 05:38.280]  focus as far as advice for anybody at this point in time. But you know I
[05:38.280 --> 05:43.360]  think the cream will rise at the top in this time. We really have to figure out
[05:43.360 --> 05:47.720]  how to stay in the game long enough to still be there when things kind of
[05:47.720 --> 05:50.760]  stabilize. Yeah you gotta stay up. You gotta stay alive for a little bit longer.
[05:50.760 --> 05:54.600]  You're almost through it. You talk about it all the time. You're almost through it.
[05:54.600 --> 06:00.520]  And guys like yourself that would be doing it regardless are the people
[06:00.520 --> 06:04.440]  that I are gonna come out the other way. That's what I believe. It's a hundred percent true and we
[06:04.440 --> 06:08.840]  as a community will support you as much as we can. So tell me exactly
[06:08.840 --> 06:14.440]  how we can support you. Oh right on. Where do we find you? Where do we buy your
[06:14.440 --> 06:19.080]  product? I think I'll hook you up with Peter. We start a conversation there.
[06:19.080 --> 06:22.000]  If we're not already caring. That would be great. That would be great. I would love
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.080]  to do that. Right now I got a big up Soulful. I ripped part of the label off
[06:27.240 --> 06:32.880]  but Soulful is in San Francisco, Sebastopol and Santa Rosa. They've been really
[06:32.880 --> 06:36.840]  supporting me and getting flour from me putting it on the shelf and
[06:36.840 --> 06:40.080]  foregrounding what I'm doing. Putting me out in the front. So I'm really
[06:40.080 --> 06:44.200]  thankful for that opportunity. Likewise I'm gonna say Mercy Wellness also Santa
[06:44.200 --> 06:49.120]  Rosa also Cotati, Sonoma County in general. Mercy Wellness has been a big
[06:49.120 --> 06:52.520]  supporter of mine the last couple years. I'm really thankful for the flour they've
[06:52.520 --> 06:56.680]  been taking off my hands putting out. It's just about those those smaller
[06:56.760 --> 07:01.080]  connections. It's not really the bulk market has treated me well up to this
[07:01.080 --> 07:06.320]  point but now it's getting kind of just overdone and people are low-balling and
[07:06.320 --> 07:09.600]  the whole thing is just kind of stupid. Yeah you ain't growing mids in that field.
[07:09.600 --> 07:15.480]  I'll tell you what. Support your local distributors. Support your local
[07:15.480 --> 07:18.960]  dispensaries. Tell them you want sun-grown weed. Tell them you want
[07:18.960 --> 07:22.440]  something higher grade than what they're putting on the shelf right now and figure
[07:22.520 --> 07:28.080]  out how to promote the small farmer because it's sad because agriculture in
[07:28.080 --> 07:32.800]  America farmers don't get any respect. Food farmers get zero respect. Food is
[07:32.800 --> 07:37.080]  worth very little to the farmer and it makes it very difficult to survive as a
[07:37.080 --> 07:42.280]  farmer. The only way we're gonna continue to have good quality products is to
[07:42.280 --> 07:47.600]  actually follow through not just lip service to local small farms but
[07:47.600 --> 07:51.320]  actually spending money at local small farms and spending money at the
[07:51.320 --> 07:55.200]  venues that support local small farms. That's the only thing that's gonna save
[07:55.200 --> 07:59.400]  us at this point. So I'm thankful for the educated you know clientele in
[07:59.400 --> 08:04.120]  California but we really need to continue that process and trying to
[08:04.120 --> 08:08.200]  represent for sun-grown is something that's always really important. So ask
[08:08.200 --> 08:12.560]  for the good flower. Ask for the outdoor flower. Ask for the light depth. Ask for
[08:12.560 --> 08:18.160]  the organic. That's really what's going to fuel the family farms because it's
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.160]  not the big guys that are growing that way. That's not what they produce. They
[08:21.160 --> 08:28.160]  produce a more chemical, more commercial, not as well carefully processed product.
[08:28.160 --> 08:31.920]  They create the boring stuff. That's the thing in five years no one's gonna give
[08:31.920 --> 08:35.280]  a shit about. Well there will be but people will evolve like we're all
[08:35.280 --> 08:39.520]  chasing THC and this THC is bullshit because once you go over 20% you get
[08:39.520 --> 08:43.200]  two flavor profiles. It gets very monotonous and very boring and people are
[08:43.200 --> 08:47.560]  gonna get tired of it after a couple years. It'll happen. So I mean thank you
[08:47.560 --> 08:52.960]  again so much for your time. How do we where are we seeing higher heights?
[08:52.960 --> 08:58.400]  Higher Heights Mando. And then what if somebody was to look at your fire here what mean
[08:58.400 --> 09:01.920]  would you set what would you say suggest them to go? Well you know I these are
[09:01.920 --> 09:04.520]  some different crosses that I've been building up over the last few years. I've
[09:04.520 --> 09:08.560]  been breeding for 20 years and I just started releasing seeds publicly so it's
[09:08.560 --> 09:13.680]  kind of a new thing for me. This guayaba is something that I really love. I made
[09:13.680 --> 09:17.920]  the carambola and I made the rockers so that's two different varieties that are
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.440]  coming out of my stable and this is just incredibly tasty weed pretty high
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.560]  terpene result and you know one thing about this is that it represents more of
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.600]  a high that is not as common in the market. I like that elevated high. I like
[09:32.600 --> 09:36.640]  that gonna go for a hike on this weed high. I don't want to be on the couch
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.720]  all passed out that's not my vibe. So oh no you got a lot of work to do in that
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.560]  farm. Trust me. So that type of flower is really what I respond to the most. Also
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.520]  this Mando biscuits Mando crumble is a really special strain. Highest terpene
[09:52.520 --> 09:57.640]  testing in the California State Fair last year. Highest terpenes in the Emerald
[09:57.640 --> 10:03.320]  Cup last year. My crop of it at Soulful right now is at 4.5. And the whole state of
[10:03.320 --> 10:11.880]  California in the State Fair. So yeah. Dude! This guy is shaking the board. I didn't make the crumble.
[10:11.880 --> 10:18.280]  CSI Humboldt made the crumble. Mendo Mikey Lyons selected the crumble. I am lucky
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.760]  enough to get to work with it as a clone plant and then I put my male called the
[10:22.760 --> 10:27.640]  rockers on it. Okay. And so we're just trying to move that genetic forward. That's fun to play with.
[10:27.640 --> 10:32.440]  Those award-winning elite things can add these unique flavor profiles and
[10:32.440 --> 10:39.440]  fun to it. So I'm really excited to see what comes out of those guys. I'm excited to see what comes up with you and hopefully we can visit you in California.
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.440]  I look forward to it. Definitely. This is cannabis project. What's your name again? Nate. Nate from Higher Heights.
