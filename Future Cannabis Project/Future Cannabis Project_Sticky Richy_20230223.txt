[00:00.120 --> 00:06.480]  That was the fun, frantic, trying to get all this stuff
[00:06.480 --> 00:09.040]  prepared as we spontaneously go live
[00:09.040 --> 00:12.200]  with Sticky Ricky from Western Massachusetts.
[00:12.200 --> 00:13.880]  Welcome.
[00:13.880 --> 00:16.520]  Did you grow up in Massachusetts?
[00:16.520 --> 00:19.040]  Born and raised here in Western Mass, yes, sir.
[00:19.040 --> 00:20.000]  Nice.
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.360]  I am born and raised in almost Eastern,
[00:24.360 --> 00:27.400]  yeah, I guess, Eastern Mass.
[00:27.400 --> 00:29.600]  Yeah.
[00:29.680 --> 00:33.280]  And we had some hailstorms here in LA this morning,
[00:33.280 --> 00:35.560]  and you guys had ice today?
[00:35.560 --> 00:36.840]  Had some snow and ice.
[00:36.840 --> 00:40.040]  Depending on the elevation, you can go down the hill
[00:40.040 --> 00:43.880]  about 10 miles, 15 miles from my homestead,
[00:43.880 --> 00:45.480]  and it's just rain.
[00:45.480 --> 00:50.520]  So it's a matter of elevation this time around.
[00:50.520 --> 00:51.360]  Got it.
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.640]  So this is a very impromptu conversation.
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.040]  And let me give people some context and background.
[01:00.040 --> 01:08.120]  So I just pinged a fellow community member
[01:08.120 --> 01:13.200]  who should be receiving a kick-ass wheelchair
[01:13.200 --> 01:16.760]  very shortly to see if he wants to jump on with us.
[01:16.760 --> 01:21.000]  And so we're doing a little fundraise.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.080]  We'll do a bunch of little fundraisers,
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.360]  but you sent me a whole bunch of stuff
[01:27.360 --> 01:30.560]  that I have just put up on the website.
[01:30.560 --> 01:34.920]  So if people know what the fundraiser is about
[01:34.920 --> 01:42.240]  and want to support, yeah, we'll go through all this stuff.
[01:42.240 --> 01:44.960]  But my point is that you sent in all that,
[01:44.960 --> 01:47.920]  which I greatly appreciate.
[01:47.960 --> 01:53.600]  And so I thought it'd be cool to have you come on and kind
[01:53.600 --> 01:55.960]  of tell your story and walk through your breeding
[01:55.960 --> 01:56.520]  and all that.
[01:56.520 --> 02:01.480]  So growing up in WVM, and you went to UVM?
[02:01.480 --> 02:02.400]  No, no.
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.200]  That was just a story about how Sticky Richie, the name,
[02:07.200 --> 02:07.920]  came about.
[02:07.920 --> 02:10.480]  I was visiting some friends there.
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.760]  And I brought my homegrown way back in the day,
[02:15.760 --> 02:17.000]  many, many years ago.
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.280]  And when I-
[02:18.280 --> 02:23.280]  And this was kind of ballpark, like, early 90s or late 80s?
[02:23.280 --> 02:25.680]  Yeah, mid-90s, I'd say, at that point.
[02:25.680 --> 02:28.720]  I'd say I grew my first plant and popped my first seeds
[02:28.720 --> 02:30.640]  in the early 90s.
[02:30.640 --> 02:35.960]  And then in the mid-90s, I went to a trip
[02:35.960 --> 02:41.360]  to visit some friends in Vermont and shared some homegrown
[02:41.360 --> 02:43.600]  with them and then went home.
[02:43.600 --> 02:45.960]  The next time I said I was coming back up to visit,
[02:45.960 --> 02:49.480]  they said, hey, make sure you bring some Sticky Richies.
[02:49.480 --> 02:52.120]  And that's where the Sticky Richie thing came in.
[02:52.120 --> 02:55.960]  And I've just kind of held on to it ever since.
[02:55.960 --> 02:57.120]  That's awesome.
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.880]  And so in terms of, like, I remember when I-
[03:02.880 --> 03:08.720]  I'm the youngest of four, so I remember, like, planting stuff
[03:08.720 --> 03:13.640]  and, like, my brother planting stuff in Solo cups at home.
[03:13.640 --> 03:15.040]  And then, like, they sprout.
[03:15.080 --> 03:16.800]  And my parents have no idea what it is.
[03:16.800 --> 03:18.600]  And then we actually- we had a three-wheeler,
[03:18.600 --> 03:20.520]  and we had bridle pads behind our house.
[03:20.520 --> 03:23.960]  So- and there he is.
[03:23.960 --> 03:24.920]  There's the man.
[03:24.920 --> 03:25.560]  What's up?
[03:25.560 --> 03:26.320]  How you doing?
[03:26.320 --> 03:28.000]  How you doing?
[03:28.000 --> 03:28.520]  Good.
[03:28.520 --> 03:29.680]  So this is very-
[03:29.680 --> 03:31.400]  I don't know if you caught any of that,
[03:31.400 --> 03:35.160]  but this is impromptu.
[03:35.160 --> 03:37.440]  Rich sent a bunch of packs in, and I
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.200]  thought we could put them towards a good cause.
[03:40.200 --> 03:48.360]  And we got a wheelchair that hopefully shipped today
[03:48.360 --> 03:50.040]  that looks badass.
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.120]  Let me cue it up.
[03:51.120 --> 03:54.640]  Yeah, that chair is fucking awesome.
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.520]  I got it in a text message here.
[03:58.520 --> 04:00.800]  Yeah, I have- here, let me- hold on.
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.280]  I have it supersized.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.040]  Yeah, there we go.
[04:03.040 --> 04:05.400]  Ooh.
[04:05.400 --> 04:07.200]  So the thing is badass.
[04:07.200 --> 04:10.200]  It's all titanium.
[04:10.200 --> 04:13.600]  The thing weighs about half of what mine weighs.
[04:13.600 --> 04:15.240]  It's got a second set of wheels for me
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.440]  to be able to go off into the wild blue yonder out here.
[04:19.440 --> 04:21.040]  I live out in the woods, and I really
[04:21.040 --> 04:23.280]  can't get my chair out where I need to get it.
[04:23.280 --> 04:25.760]  And this one's going to give me that ability to be able to- I
[04:25.760 --> 04:27.200]  can weed-eat my backyard.
[04:27.200 --> 04:30.040]  I can go off of the pavement in the chair
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.200]  that this one's coming.
[04:31.200 --> 04:32.400]  And when I got-
[04:32.400 --> 04:36.000]  Most importantly, do you see that comment?
[04:38.760 --> 04:39.320]  Oh, I know.
[04:39.320 --> 04:40.960]  And that's what I've been practicing.
[04:40.960 --> 04:42.480]  Suddenly, I was saying, I fucking-
[04:42.480 --> 04:44.040]  I fiend to go golfing, man.
[04:44.040 --> 04:45.880]  I've been out here practicing golfing.
[04:45.880 --> 04:47.920]  And I'm getting better at standing up and hitting
[04:47.920 --> 04:48.600]  that ball.
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.720]  I used to golf every day almost.
[04:51.720 --> 04:53.200]  I golfed so damn much.
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.000]  It's something I miss so bad to just be able to get out
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.280]  in a- on some grass, man.
[04:59.280 --> 05:01.200]  I hate being stuck on pavement.
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.360]  That thing's going to help me out.
[05:02.360 --> 05:04.680]  It's going to let me be able to do so much stuff around
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.200]  my house.
[05:05.200 --> 05:07.480]  I can't thank you enough, Peter, and this community
[05:07.480 --> 05:09.640]  for helping out with getting me something
[05:09.640 --> 05:11.720]  that I wasn't going to be able to do myself.
[05:11.720 --> 05:13.560]  I tried to do that two years ago,
[05:13.560 --> 05:16.360]  and I just couldn't- I couldn't pull the funds together
[05:16.360 --> 05:16.840]  to do it.
[05:19.520 --> 05:20.120]  Yeah, no.
[05:20.120 --> 05:28.880]  I love- I was talking to someone down here in LA who
[05:28.920 --> 05:33.080]  was talking about how- I'm trying
[05:33.080 --> 05:34.400]  to think of how to phrase this.
[05:34.400 --> 05:36.040]  But there's a community of people
[05:36.040 --> 05:41.000]  who care about each other, even though we've maybe all only met
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.360]  more recently.
[05:42.360 --> 05:46.240]  This guy was talking about how people from high school,
[05:46.240 --> 05:48.720]  he doesn't feel as connected.
[05:48.720 --> 05:51.640]  We were talking about the events we're doing in LA
[05:51.640 --> 05:57.320]  and just how it's bringing together-
[05:57.320 --> 06:02.160]  everyone leaves their baggage or bad attitude or everything
[06:02.160 --> 06:05.040]  at the door and just comes together and has a good time
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.840]  together and makes friendships with people.
[06:08.840 --> 06:16.400]  And also, this- whether we're together physically
[06:16.400 --> 06:19.960]  or digitally, it's pretty cool to see.
[06:19.960 --> 06:21.640]  And people helping each other out.
[06:21.640 --> 06:25.480]  I mean, we've- Tony and I have seen all sorts of people
[06:25.480 --> 06:29.160]  helping each other out who don't need to help each other out.
[06:29.160 --> 06:33.600]  And just see someone who could use a minute of help
[06:33.600 --> 06:35.080]  and just go do it.
[06:35.080 --> 06:38.560]  And it's cool.
[06:38.560 --> 06:41.840]  And don't forget, Tony's reputation
[06:41.840 --> 06:45.320]  is to help the community, and he's been there helping people
[06:45.320 --> 06:46.360]  for a long time.
[06:46.360 --> 06:49.840]  So it feels good for other of us out there
[06:49.840 --> 06:52.000]  to be able to give back for sure.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.960]  And Alex, check your IG DM.
[06:55.960 --> 06:57.520]  I appreciate you saying that, man.
[07:02.750 --> 07:06.270]  What we got to do, just do it instead of talking about it.
[07:06.270 --> 07:07.830]  We always talk about community, right?
[07:07.830 --> 07:10.230]  And I use the examples with myself.
[07:10.230 --> 07:15.070]  Gummy Girl, Chris, Peter, Hall, what you got?
[07:15.070 --> 07:18.110]  My friends that are not just on these shows talking to me,
[07:18.110 --> 07:21.030]  but they're stepping up and help other people do stuff.
[07:21.070 --> 07:24.510]  It's not just because we're going to profit off of anything.
[07:24.510 --> 07:28.230]  It's because in general, people need help.
[07:28.230 --> 07:30.870]  The more we act on that, the better life becomes.
[07:30.870 --> 07:33.150]  You feel better fucking helping someone out.
[07:33.150 --> 07:35.750]  Even if it was like someone shared my post yesterday
[07:35.750 --> 07:37.390]  because of my roof being fucked up.
[07:37.390 --> 07:40.230]  And it helped me raise some funds that's
[07:40.230 --> 07:42.790]  going to get that fixed, all because someone on Facebook
[07:42.790 --> 07:46.070]  that I haven't talked to in quite a while shared my post.
[07:46.070 --> 07:48.390]  One of his friends hit me up that used to support me back
[07:48.390 --> 07:50.190]  when I used to be in the PFA.
[07:50.190 --> 07:52.630]  And that cat's going to, he's helped me out
[07:52.630 --> 07:54.070]  more than I can say.
[07:54.070 --> 07:55.350]  That's important.
[07:55.350 --> 07:57.270]  That's important stuff.
[07:57.270 --> 08:01.150]  It's like, it's hard to, for some of us
[08:01.150 --> 08:07.470]  who have been in the cannabis, with the cannabis plant
[08:07.470 --> 08:12.470]  for so long, it was a long time of by yourself quietness
[08:12.470 --> 08:15.950]  about it and not risking for help for me personally.
[08:15.990 --> 08:20.710]  So coming out of my shell and talking to the community
[08:20.710 --> 08:24.950]  and opening up has only created some really great relationships.
[08:24.950 --> 08:28.350]  So I understand what you're saying.
[08:28.350 --> 08:34.150]  And it feels like we need to open up more to that idea.
[08:34.150 --> 08:37.110]  And the more we reach out and help each other,
[08:37.110 --> 08:40.230]  the stronger we feel together.
[08:40.230 --> 08:41.590]  100%.
[08:41.590 --> 08:46.870]  So with that, to contextualize this conversation,
[08:46.870 --> 08:51.150]  I thought it'd be cool to have Rich kind of tell his story
[08:51.150 --> 08:53.510]  and get into his breeding.
[08:53.510 --> 08:56.550]  And kind of, we got to start somewhere.
[08:56.550 --> 09:00.510]  So we're back in the early 90s.
[09:00.510 --> 09:05.990]  You're a pint-sized rich in Western Massachusetts.
[09:05.990 --> 09:07.390]  What was the weed scene like?
[09:07.390 --> 09:10.430]  Was it like you and your high school friends?
[09:10.470 --> 09:15.030]  I was a not popular.
[09:15.030 --> 09:17.390]  We moved out into the middle of the country
[09:17.390 --> 09:20.270]  at a really kind of weird time of my life.
[09:20.270 --> 09:24.350]  So there was only like eight kids in each class.
[09:24.350 --> 09:28.150]  And they were best friends since birth up in the country.
[09:28.150 --> 09:30.830]  So moving in at that time period,
[09:30.830 --> 09:32.590]  they just kind of pecked you where you were.
[09:32.590 --> 09:34.790]  And you were that for the rest of your time
[09:34.790 --> 09:36.270]  through high school basically.
[09:36.270 --> 09:39.630]  And I just kind of stuck with a very small circle
[09:39.630 --> 09:41.550]  by myself really throughout high school.
[09:41.550 --> 09:45.150]  And it wasn't towards the very end of high school
[09:45.150 --> 09:50.830]  that I got into it at all.
[09:50.830 --> 09:55.350]  And I think at that point, right towards the end of high school,
[09:55.350 --> 09:57.710]  late on compared to some folks.
[09:57.710 --> 10:06.350]  But as I graduated, then I was introduced to some folks who,
[10:06.350 --> 10:08.350]  I was on a different path at that point.
[10:08.350 --> 10:13.470]  I was going to be a para-rescue or something to that effect.
[10:13.470 --> 10:15.350]  I was going to sign up for the military.
[10:15.350 --> 10:17.750]  I had this whole plan going where
[10:17.750 --> 10:20.030]  I was on a different path.
[10:20.030 --> 10:24.710]  And I got a job at a local restaurant nearby.
[10:24.710 --> 10:30.110]  And some folks there, right about the same time,
[10:30.110 --> 10:37.670]  I started my smoking for the first time.
[10:37.710 --> 10:41.110]  And it kind of, you know how it opens your eyes
[10:41.110 --> 10:42.190]  to a lot of things.
[10:42.190 --> 10:45.430]  And I kind of changed immediately.
[10:45.430 --> 10:48.710]  And with some advice from some folks who were there,
[10:48.710 --> 10:52.550]  they said, maybe the military is not your choice right then.
[10:52.550 --> 10:59.430]  And that kind of shifted me into a much different trajectory,
[10:59.430 --> 11:03.230]  which put me towards my first Grateful Dead show.
[11:03.230 --> 11:08.310]  I know it's very cliche at this point,
[11:08.310 --> 11:11.430]  but that's where I found the scene.
[11:11.430 --> 11:16.150]  That's where I found my first quality cannabis flower.
[11:16.150 --> 11:20.430]  That's where I found my first seed in that extremely
[11:20.430 --> 11:25.030]  overpriced eighth and planted that.
[11:25.030 --> 11:26.990]  And that brought me towards something
[11:26.990 --> 11:32.270]  that was maybe better than what we had, which was, for me,
[11:32.270 --> 11:39.750]  it was just homegrown from folks that were nearby to me
[11:39.750 --> 11:41.310]  at the time.
[11:41.310 --> 11:48.430]  And I wasn't really ever in the scene as far as out there
[11:48.430 --> 11:50.870]  buying the commercial and knowing
[11:50.870 --> 11:53.910]  all the different kinds of compressed Mexicans
[11:53.910 --> 11:54.510]  and all that.
[11:54.510 --> 11:56.190]  That wasn't really the scene.
[11:56.190 --> 12:01.110]  It was more of a self-sufficient attitude or lifestyle
[12:01.110 --> 12:03.390]  from up in the small town hill towns.
[12:03.390 --> 12:07.910]  And so my first encounters with it
[12:07.910 --> 12:13.270]  were with that kind of leafy, shitty homegrown.
[12:13.270 --> 12:15.270]  And then the seeds were from there.
[12:15.270 --> 12:20.030]  And then the first identifiable seeds that I remember getting
[12:20.030 --> 12:25.830]  and planting were Big Bud and Northern Lights.
[12:25.830 --> 12:28.150]  So I dabbled with that for a little while,
[12:28.190 --> 12:31.430]  not knowing anything about what I was doing at the time.
[12:31.430 --> 12:33.950]  It was just planting stuff out there
[12:33.950 --> 12:36.430]  and watching them mostly wither away.
[12:36.430 --> 12:40.870]  And it was a tough, tough time having
[12:40.870 --> 12:44.710]  to be so stealth about it mainly and then not
[12:44.710 --> 12:46.430]  knowing much about it.
[12:46.430 --> 12:48.230]  The internet wasn't what it was.
[12:48.230 --> 12:52.070]  So we just made our way through it like everybody else.
[12:52.070 --> 12:53.590]  Super small, tight circles.
[12:53.590 --> 12:56.910]  It wasn't until the early 90s that we really
[12:57.630 --> 13:02.110]  kind of the stride of finding correct genetics
[13:02.110 --> 13:07.270]  and starting to really sprout them and select for things.
[13:07.270 --> 13:10.990]  We made our first tight circle, made the first trip
[13:10.990 --> 13:15.550]  to Amsterdam in 98.
[13:15.550 --> 13:19.150]  And in that trip brought home some seeds
[13:19.150 --> 13:22.830]  that really changed a lot of the game for us
[13:22.830 --> 13:28.430]  as far as the quality of what we had around.
[13:28.430 --> 13:32.350]  Some of those were that night, Super Silver Haze.
[13:32.350 --> 13:36.030]  We had some amazing plants from that first release of that.
[13:36.030 --> 13:37.150]  It was just insane.
[13:37.150 --> 13:39.350]  Some of the best flavors and scents.
[13:39.350 --> 13:43.230]  And it was like nothing we had seen.
[13:43.230 --> 13:46.430]  There was some other ones in there.
[13:46.430 --> 13:48.950]  One of them, believe it or not, was a Mexican sativa
[13:48.950 --> 13:52.590]  that has been worked here locally for a long time.
[13:53.350 --> 13:54.830]  There's some pictures on my feed.
[13:54.830 --> 13:59.710]  And it turned out now it finishes in October.
[13:59.710 --> 14:01.430]  It's really, really interesting stuff.
[14:01.430 --> 14:04.910]  We crossed it, or part of our tight circle there.
[14:04.910 --> 14:08.630]  One of my good buddies crossed it with the sour diesel.
[14:08.630 --> 14:10.870]  And it's an amazing plant.
[14:10.870 --> 14:15.710]  But anyways, so at that point, we, yeah, just in the 90s,
[14:15.710 --> 14:19.310]  started to, late 90s, after that trip,
[14:19.310 --> 14:22.230]  started to tap into some great genetics.
[14:22.990 --> 14:30.990]  Persons in my tight circle also was big into the forums.
[14:30.990 --> 14:32.550]  I wasn't really per se,
[14:32.550 --> 14:35.510]  but he was kind of our representation at the time.
[14:35.510 --> 14:38.750]  And he was able to start trading and collecting cuts.
[14:38.750 --> 14:42.310]  And he had quite an amazing seed bank of all the classics.
[14:42.310 --> 14:45.910]  So I was really lucky to able to tap into a lot of those,
[14:45.910 --> 14:51.150]  even though my skills at the time were not up to par
[14:51.150 --> 14:56.150]  as far as preserving and keeping them around,
[14:56.190 --> 14:59.790]  making seeds, opening up some seed stock to preserve those.
[14:59.790 --> 15:03.790]  In that forum, collecting the cuts and stuff.
[15:03.790 --> 15:05.270]  I had a lot to learn at that point.
[15:05.270 --> 15:06.790]  So we lost a ton of stuff.
[15:08.790 --> 15:11.630]  But, so between those two things,
[15:11.630 --> 15:16.270]  I was really able to see a lot of the things
[15:16.270 --> 15:18.710]  that people are talking about and have been able to,
[15:18.710 --> 15:22.870]  I've been able to personally work with a lot of these,
[15:24.230 --> 15:26.790]  be more classic genetics from out time.
[15:27.990 --> 15:32.990]  Or more recently in the last 10 years or so,
[15:33.830 --> 15:37.990]  it's been shifting more towards preservation projects
[15:37.990 --> 15:42.990]  and personal breeding projects and just stuff like that.
[15:43.590 --> 15:48.190]  And primarily only for outdoor growing,
[15:48.550 --> 15:52.230]  well, not only for, but it's been all done outdoors
[15:52.230 --> 15:55.670]  with the intent of performing outdoors in the Northeast.
[15:57.230 --> 15:59.310]  So that's kind of been my focus
[16:00.550 --> 16:03.750]  as far as that goes in a short nutshell.
[16:03.750 --> 16:07.030]  There's currently I'm living on a homestead here
[16:07.030 --> 16:10.550]  in Western Mass where we do sustainable agriculture.
[16:10.550 --> 16:12.510]  And I have all the animals
[16:12.510 --> 16:14.470]  that I try to run through our pastures
[16:15.470 --> 16:19.550]  and try to grow as many things as we can.
[16:19.550 --> 16:23.230]  Currently Massachusetts is a real tough place
[16:23.230 --> 16:24.750]  to get licensed for cannabis.
[16:24.750 --> 16:29.310]  I've been trying for years to get licensed here on my farm
[16:30.830 --> 16:35.830]  with Farm Bug Co-op, a cooperative of crafts growers
[16:36.830 --> 16:38.550]  that I am a founding member of.
[16:38.550 --> 16:41.310]  We've been trying to work with a bunch
[16:41.310 --> 16:43.310]  of local towns in Massachusetts.
[16:44.710 --> 16:48.830]  But Massachusetts is stacked for the big businesses
[16:48.830 --> 16:52.110]  and testing alone and microbial thresholds
[16:52.110 --> 16:55.030]  make it extremely difficult to produce anything
[16:55.830 --> 16:58.510]  other than in a super sterile environment in Massachusetts.
[16:58.510 --> 17:01.390]  So it's been nothing but a long uphill battle
[17:01.390 --> 17:02.310]  on that department.
[17:02.310 --> 17:05.070]  But currently I'm on the homestead.
[17:05.070 --> 17:07.790]  We've been practicing all kinds of stuff here,
[17:07.790 --> 17:11.030]  raising broiler chickens.
[17:11.030 --> 17:13.790]  We do that organic pasture raised broiler chickens.
[17:13.830 --> 17:15.950]  We raise those through our pasture.
[17:15.950 --> 17:20.950]  Once a year we've raised goats and sheep and pigs
[17:22.550 --> 17:25.070]  where we use the pigs to renovate
[17:25.070 --> 17:28.670]  and clear back the wood lines.
[17:28.670 --> 17:32.270]  And then we use that manure and all the manure
[17:32.270 --> 17:34.790]  from the chickens to feed the pastures.
[17:34.790 --> 17:37.990]  And in turn, all of that pastures here
[17:37.990 --> 17:42.230]  they're eating some organic grain that we spread up
[17:42.270 --> 17:45.430]  and throw onto their, to some stumps.
[17:45.430 --> 17:48.310]  Did you see my joke on your IG feed?
[17:48.310 --> 17:50.310]  Yeah, I thought that was hilarious.
[17:50.310 --> 17:53.230]  They are running around pretty quickly, huh?
[17:53.230 --> 17:57.550]  This is cocaine bear, the sequel, cocaine pigs.
[17:59.070 --> 18:01.550]  Yeah, this is an example of them
[18:01.550 --> 18:06.550]  after they kind of tore apart beach sapling thickets
[18:06.670 --> 18:09.550]  that were in an area on the edge of the pasture
[18:09.550 --> 18:11.910]  where they had forested long ago.
[18:12.590 --> 18:13.830]  When we bought this homestead,
[18:13.830 --> 18:18.150]  it was kind of not being used for anything at all.
[18:18.150 --> 18:20.070]  The person who owned it would mow it,
[18:20.070 --> 18:22.590]  just mow it, mow it, mow it three times a week.
[18:22.590 --> 18:25.470]  And nothing grew here for a long time.
[18:25.470 --> 18:29.710]  So we're just kind of revitalizing everything that's here.
[18:29.710 --> 18:34.230]  And it's been a really amazing, cool journey
[18:35.750 --> 18:37.310]  and a learning experience.
[18:37.310 --> 18:39.750]  Learning how to preserve seeds,
[18:39.750 --> 18:43.790]  vegetable seeds and cannabis seeds and maple syrup boiling
[18:43.790 --> 18:48.590]  and just try to do as much as we can from our land here
[18:48.590 --> 18:51.310]  without bringing in outside sources.
[18:51.310 --> 18:53.390]  You know the story.
[18:53.390 --> 18:57.830]  We've just, it was a few years ago now
[18:57.830 --> 19:02.510]  that I went to the Regen Conference that Dutch threw
[19:03.870 --> 19:07.630]  and it was very super, super inspiring for me
[19:07.630 --> 19:09.630]  that it brought me out of my shell.
[19:10.510 --> 19:13.110]  It made me want to talk about the things that we're up to.
[19:13.110 --> 19:16.230]  It made me want to speak out for cannabis
[19:16.230 --> 19:19.670]  against the people who are really trying to shut it down
[19:19.670 --> 19:21.230]  in our community.
[19:21.230 --> 19:26.230]  Our community has been really kind of bullied here.
[19:26.230 --> 19:27.390]  It's a beautiful place.
[19:27.390 --> 19:28.750]  Bullied here locally.
[19:28.750 --> 19:33.270]  And so I'm just finally made a choice to make a stand
[19:33.270 --> 19:37.910]  and to speak out for what we all as a community believe in
[19:37.910 --> 19:39.830]  here locally in Massachusetts
[19:39.830 --> 19:41.990]  where it's just especially hard.
[19:43.070 --> 19:44.070]  So yeah, I don't know.
[19:44.070 --> 19:45.230]  I won't ramble on forever,
[19:45.230 --> 19:48.670]  but that's kind of the gist of what I'm trying to do.
[19:48.670 --> 19:52.870]  I've been mainly, to be honest, a selector, hunter
[19:52.870 --> 19:56.470]  and a connoisseur my whole life of finding
[19:56.470 --> 19:59.150]  and growing out and selecting them.
[19:59.150 --> 20:02.070]  And then the breeding thing has come on in my older age
[20:02.070 --> 20:05.950]  as I've just wanted to dive deeper in and create
[20:06.430 --> 20:08.830]  and to use things as a palette.
[20:08.830 --> 20:11.590]  After listening to people like Kevin Jodri
[20:11.590 --> 20:16.590]  and yourself, Tony, talk about how you can,
[20:16.790 --> 20:19.030]  how you can tap into these things and open them up
[20:19.030 --> 20:22.550]  and have more seeds to hold onto for the future.
[20:22.550 --> 20:25.550]  So all of those practices are things that I adopted
[20:25.550 --> 20:26.510]  and started to do.
[20:26.510 --> 20:31.510]  And for instance, the Gosney seeds that Kevin Jodri
[20:32.830 --> 20:34.630]  passed out at that conference,
[20:34.630 --> 20:37.350]  I got like 10 of them, but I opened them up
[20:37.350 --> 20:39.750]  and I tried to open pollinate them as big as I could.
[20:39.750 --> 20:41.270]  So I have more to dive into.
[20:41.270 --> 20:43.390]  Unfortunately, they got moldy
[20:43.390 --> 20:45.550]  because I was trying to juggle too many things.
[20:45.550 --> 20:47.350]  So it didn't work out.
[20:47.350 --> 20:51.950]  But anyways, that's the idea of kind of like tapping in
[20:51.950 --> 20:54.910]  and opening up and just, I've been doing a lot of that.
[20:54.910 --> 20:57.830]  And legalization here has really helped me
[20:57.830 --> 21:02.830]  come out of my shell and really embrace it all.
[21:03.310 --> 21:05.750]  And as far as the community goes, I also,
[21:05.750 --> 21:08.310]  the neighbors have been very cool about that.
[21:08.310 --> 21:09.790]  Some neighbors in the community,
[21:09.790 --> 21:12.110]  legalization in Massachusetts allows
[21:12.110 --> 21:13.870]  a certain personal limit.
[21:13.870 --> 21:16.070]  And when your friends don't care as much,
[21:16.070 --> 21:17.710]  they let you, you know, pheno hunt,
[21:17.710 --> 21:21.470]  there's your six plants on their property for their numbers.
[21:21.470 --> 21:25.230]  You're able to kind of chip away at your numbers, you know?
[21:25.230 --> 21:27.630]  And as I get more recognition,
[21:28.510 --> 21:31.830]  I've been doing some consultation work
[21:32.390 --> 21:33.790]  on the genetic side of things.
[21:33.790 --> 21:36.550]  And that's getting some of my work
[21:36.550 --> 21:40.190]  into bigger pheno hunts in bigger areas.
[21:40.190 --> 21:42.510]  And it's been quite exciting to take part
[21:42.510 --> 21:43.830]  in all of this, to be honest.
[21:43.830 --> 21:46.510]  So that's the gist of where I'm at.
[21:46.510 --> 21:48.990]  And it's really an honor to be here.
[21:48.990 --> 21:52.670]  And I'm super stoked to support what you all do.
[21:52.670 --> 21:54.190]  That's for sure.
[21:54.190 --> 21:55.030]  That's awesome.
[21:55.030 --> 21:58.070]  So I have two, I'm gonna forget one question.
[21:58.070 --> 22:00.670]  So I'm gonna, don't answer this one first,
[22:00.670 --> 22:05.190]  but you deal with moisture, right?
[22:05.190 --> 22:06.830]  Like in the fall and stuff.
[22:07.830 --> 22:08.670]  Yeah, the fall is brewing.
[22:08.670 --> 22:12.950]  So is a lot of your breeding focused on kind of like
[22:12.950 --> 22:17.270]  getting through harvest without those issues?
[22:17.270 --> 22:19.670]  Yeah, we're trying to battle.
[22:19.670 --> 22:21.230]  And so we'll talk about that
[22:21.230 --> 22:22.230]  when we talk about your breeding.
[22:22.230 --> 22:26.190]  But the first question is cannabis, it's a plant,
[22:26.190 --> 22:28.190]  you're homesteading,
[22:28.190 --> 22:31.070]  they're kind of parallel and complimentary.
[22:31.070 --> 22:33.830]  Were you like raised on a farm or like,
[22:33.830 --> 22:34.910]  were you a city boy?
[22:34.910 --> 22:38.950]  And then like, how did that kind of all come together
[22:38.950 --> 22:41.030]  that you're now, like, are you living on a farm
[22:41.030 --> 22:43.190]  with friends, with family, with?
[22:44.990 --> 22:48.510]  I personally always dreamed of,
[22:49.790 --> 22:54.030]  shortly after that time in the very early nineties,
[22:54.030 --> 22:59.030]  I was at a restaurant working as a prep cook,
[22:59.310 --> 23:02.390]  I believe, or a dishwasher even at the time.
[23:02.390 --> 23:05.470]  And I was trying to figure out my path.
[23:05.470 --> 23:08.910]  And the person that I said was giving me tips
[23:08.910 --> 23:10.870]  on maybe that's not the path for you.
[23:10.870 --> 23:14.150]  They were homesteaders in this really small town
[23:14.150 --> 23:17.670]  and they had built their home with their own hands.
[23:17.670 --> 23:19.030]  It was really amazing.
[23:19.870 --> 23:22.270]  Post and beam, it was just, you know,
[23:22.310 --> 23:25.670]  just really amazing architecture.
[23:25.670 --> 23:27.150]  And I thought it was incredible.
[23:27.150 --> 23:29.190]  They had their friends.
[23:29.190 --> 23:32.910]  He bought a barn from like four towns down
[23:32.910 --> 23:35.710]  and disassembled it and everybody hauled it
[23:35.710 --> 23:37.990]  across those towns and raised it all up together
[23:37.990 --> 23:39.710]  as a thing, you know, a community.
[23:39.710 --> 23:41.910]  All of these things resounded to me
[23:41.910 --> 23:43.590]  and they were raising animals
[23:43.590 --> 23:44.990]  and they had beautiful gardens
[23:44.990 --> 23:48.510]  and they were always, had the most delicious food available
[23:48.510 --> 23:49.430]  when you visited.
[23:49.430 --> 23:51.750]  And it was just a welcoming place.
[23:52.430 --> 23:55.470]  And that really resounded with me.
[23:55.470 --> 23:58.830]  And as I, although I couldn't achieve it then,
[23:58.830 --> 24:01.550]  I dreamed of it for a long time.
[24:01.550 --> 24:06.550]  And I followed other paths and I was in property management
[24:08.070 --> 24:12.030]  and doing things that I, you know, that pulled me away
[24:12.030 --> 24:14.510]  from what I really, really loved to do,
[24:14.510 --> 24:17.390]  which I didn't, you know, I tried landscaping
[24:17.390 --> 24:19.510]  and I tried things that were closer to that,
[24:19.510 --> 24:21.950]  that got me closer to farming.
[24:22.630 --> 24:24.190]  But in Massachusetts, it was just,
[24:24.190 --> 24:27.470]  it's such a weird thing that I almost believed
[24:27.470 --> 24:30.510]  that it wasn't possible to be a successful farm
[24:30.510 --> 24:34.230]  because it's so hard to do here in Massachusetts.
[24:34.230 --> 24:35.070]  So I don't know.
[24:35.070 --> 24:35.950]  I just had it in my mind,
[24:35.950 --> 24:37.390]  like it was a block that I couldn't do.
[24:37.390 --> 24:42.390]  So I tried a bunch of other, in the end,
[24:42.470 --> 24:47.470]  I sold the business and we just moved on from a,
[24:52.870 --> 24:57.310]  I ended up a separation from my wife
[24:57.310 --> 25:00.150]  over that whole kind of stressful,
[25:00.150 --> 25:03.070]  life-changing stress bomb of trying to run
[25:03.070 --> 25:05.990]  a property management company and raise kids
[25:05.990 --> 25:07.830]  and all of that and something I didn't wanna do.
[25:07.830 --> 25:11.150]  So it inspired me,
[25:15.230 --> 25:17.390]  it inspired me to do something that I really,
[25:17.390 --> 25:19.190]  really, really did want to do.
[25:19.190 --> 25:24.190]  So I sacrificed a lot to get to where I'm at, basically.
[25:26.430 --> 25:31.430]  I don't have that career or that high paying job,
[25:31.790 --> 25:36.790]  but what I do have is this land that we were able to get.
[25:38.150 --> 25:40.990]  And it's a small chunk of the world.
[25:40.990 --> 25:44.390]  It's some swamp land and a big hill and a pasture
[25:44.390 --> 25:47.870]  and a 40 acre spot here with a meager household on it.
[25:47.870 --> 25:51.910]  But we are making what we are out of it.
[25:51.910 --> 25:56.910]  And it's just becoming a much more amazing spot every day
[25:58.590 --> 25:59.790]  that we've been here.
[26:01.110 --> 26:03.110]  I know I skipped so many details.
[26:03.110 --> 26:05.950]  It's hard to really get into the whole gist of it, but.
[26:07.110 --> 26:10.510]  No, that's, I mean, I love, I mean, it's like,
[26:10.510 --> 26:13.550]  I fantasize all the time about just getting
[26:13.550 --> 26:16.430]  a couple acres somewhere to start being able
[26:16.470 --> 26:18.030]  to do what I want to do.
[26:18.030 --> 26:20.550]  It's basically what happened.
[26:20.550 --> 26:24.510]  I dreamed about it until the last seven years I've been,
[26:24.510 --> 26:29.270]  no, seven years I came here, but I was renting it at first.
[26:29.270 --> 26:33.190]  And I wasn't, we weren't able to, my partner, Maya and I,
[26:34.510 --> 26:39.150]  who live here, we weren't able to secure it
[26:39.150 --> 26:41.390]  until about like four years ago.
[26:41.390 --> 26:44.710]  So that's when I really was able to start 100%
[26:44.710 --> 26:47.390]  changing everything because we knew it was ours.
[26:49.350 --> 26:54.030]  So at that point I had been dreaming and watching things
[26:55.350 --> 26:58.710]  and reading Mother Earth news and just doing
[26:58.710 --> 27:00.190]  all those things my whole life,
[27:00.190 --> 27:04.310]  practicing for this moment to launch into
[27:04.310 --> 27:07.110]  having the blank palette to try all these things.
[27:07.110 --> 27:10.270]  So it's been, and then COVID hit, so I couldn't even leave.
[27:10.270 --> 27:13.790]  And I was forced to stay here
[27:13.790 --> 27:16.910]  and kind of work the land and create
[27:16.910 --> 27:20.430]  the best garden years we've had
[27:20.430 --> 27:24.550]  just because we were so focused on such a micro space
[27:24.550 --> 27:26.910]  and everything that we had was right here
[27:26.910 --> 27:29.630]  and really healthy and lush.
[27:29.630 --> 27:33.030]  So I don't know, I've been learning so much
[27:33.030 --> 27:38.030]  since I've dove into this lifestyle.
[27:40.030 --> 27:42.590]  The more, put it this way, the more and more I dive in,
[27:42.630 --> 27:47.070]  the more I'm rewarded and feel like it is an answer
[27:47.070 --> 27:52.070]  to a lot of bigger problems that we face.
[27:54.310 --> 27:55.150]  That's awesome.
[27:55.150 --> 27:59.950]  And here's a gratuitous weed shot.
[27:59.950 --> 28:04.270]  So in terms of your growing and breeding,
[28:06.510 --> 28:11.230]  obviously one kind of factor is stuff
[28:11.230 --> 28:13.230]  that works in your environment.
[28:13.230 --> 28:15.150]  So that's kind of part of your breeding,
[28:15.150 --> 28:19.990]  but then are you breeding for like your own palette?
[28:19.990 --> 28:22.350]  Like what do you enjoy personally?
[28:22.350 --> 28:26.390]  And kind of, does that coincide with what you're exploring
[28:26.390 --> 28:27.830]  from a breeding standpoint?
[28:29.630 --> 28:30.870]  Kind of.
[28:30.870 --> 28:35.870]  For a long time, because of my quiet stealthness and phobia
[28:36.870 --> 28:40.870]  of the public thinking that I'm doing something wrong
[28:40.870 --> 28:43.750]  and less than, I didn't really speak out.
[28:43.750 --> 28:45.950]  So I only had a couple of flavors
[28:45.950 --> 28:48.190]  and being here in Western Mass,
[28:48.190 --> 28:51.350]  one of them was the chem dog
[28:51.350 --> 28:55.470]  and the other I had a really amazing Jack Herrera
[28:55.470 --> 28:56.550]  that I kept on to.
[28:56.550 --> 28:59.990]  And I was riding those out for quite a while,
[28:59.990 --> 29:00.830]  believe it or not.
[29:00.830 --> 29:04.070]  Just those two were my, just that's all I needed.
[29:04.310 --> 29:07.430]  And I just kind of dove into those for a long time.
[29:07.430 --> 29:11.750]  But the chem is my favorite turf profile.
[29:11.750 --> 29:13.190]  It's my favorite aroma.
[29:13.190 --> 29:15.230]  It's my favorite punch to the head.
[29:15.230 --> 29:18.110]  I've just, I love it.
[29:18.110 --> 29:19.270]  I just love it, love it, love it.
[29:19.270 --> 29:23.270]  I know it's from Western Mass, so that's probably expected.
[29:23.270 --> 29:27.270]  But I've not had the greatest success
[29:27.270 --> 29:28.790]  when I've crossed it to everything
[29:28.790 --> 29:30.950]  as far as outdoor performances out here.
[29:30.950 --> 29:33.350]  So I drifted away from that years ago.
[29:33.670 --> 29:37.230]  These years, I've, you know, I popped a bunch of,
[29:37.230 --> 29:38.990]  since legalization happened,
[29:38.990 --> 29:42.030]  I was able to just source a bunch of really cool seeds.
[29:42.030 --> 29:45.230]  So I started a bunch of different company seeds
[29:45.230 --> 29:47.590]  and I was, I started at that point
[29:47.590 --> 29:52.110]  from what was performing well here, what performed well.
[29:52.110 --> 29:55.110]  And that was kind of my launching point.
[29:55.110 --> 29:58.430]  Like for instance, that plant that you showed recently
[29:58.430 --> 30:01.110]  that I was next to was the forbidden jelly plant.
[30:01.390 --> 30:04.990]  It's a plant that was actually by in-house genetics
[30:04.990 --> 30:09.990]  for forbidden fruit times jelly breath, I believe.
[30:10.710 --> 30:15.710]  And all the other plants kind of had a really normal
[30:17.150 --> 30:22.150]  straightforward orangey sort of citrus profile to it,
[30:24.190 --> 30:29.190]  forbidden fruit style turf profile.
[30:30.030 --> 30:31.950]  The one that was in that picture,
[30:31.950 --> 30:36.950]  I selected the season before because of its extreme vigor.
[30:36.990 --> 30:41.990]  And also it had a much more unique aroma profile to it.
[30:42.750 --> 30:45.830]  It was like this really spicy incensey thing
[30:45.830 --> 30:48.790]  that was really complex and really unique.
[30:48.790 --> 30:50.710]  It's really, really special.
[30:50.710 --> 30:52.630]  You could smell it in the air and the smoke
[30:52.630 --> 30:57.630]  and it finished beautifully.
[30:58.150 --> 30:59.430]  It was very resistant.
[30:59.430 --> 31:00.510]  Some of the other ones weren't.
[31:00.510 --> 31:02.190]  So I used that and I crossed that
[31:02.190 --> 31:04.310]  to a bunch of things along the line.
[31:04.310 --> 31:06.790]  One of the star standouts was the cross
[31:06.790 --> 31:10.630]  to the purple unicorn by Bodhi.
[31:10.630 --> 31:14.390]  I've been working, one of the things I've been working with
[31:14.390 --> 31:17.230]  is his purple unicorn line.
[31:17.230 --> 31:21.190]  I've hunted some males throughout the years.
[31:21.190 --> 31:24.150]  He's released them in a few different filial generations
[31:24.150 --> 31:25.250]  throughout the years.
[31:26.250 --> 31:31.050]  And I found one male that I used a bunch
[31:31.050 --> 31:32.970]  and I liked it a lot.
[31:32.970 --> 31:37.970]  It adds some really, it allowed me to keep some characteristics
[31:39.010 --> 31:42.290]  I found instead of just a watered down version
[31:42.290 --> 31:44.930]  of the things I was trying to create,
[31:44.930 --> 31:48.010]  this purple unicorn seemed to accentuate
[31:48.010 --> 31:49.490]  some of the good characteristics
[31:49.490 --> 31:52.350]  of the female plants that were pollinated.
[31:53.350 --> 31:55.190]  So...
[31:56.390 --> 31:58.270]  Just quickly, do you see this?
[31:58.270 --> 31:59.270]  Yeah.
[31:59.270 --> 32:01.630]  So this is the forbidden jelly cross
[32:01.630 --> 32:03.270]  with the purple unicorn, right?
[32:05.350 --> 32:07.670]  No, I'm sorry, that's not.
[32:07.670 --> 32:12.670]  That is a, I did my first feminized cross a while ago
[32:13.710 --> 32:16.230]  and that is a tester of those seeds.
[32:16.230 --> 32:19.430]  That is a chopped cherry times white truffle.
[32:20.270 --> 32:21.390]  Ah, I get it.
[32:21.390 --> 32:26.390]  I did an indoor test run of one of those crosses.
[32:31.430 --> 32:32.790]  And then I grew it outside.
[32:33.630 --> 32:35.110]  I don't know, I don't necessarily,
[32:35.110 --> 32:40.110]  I didn't have the greatest success with feminized.
[32:41.150 --> 32:44.270]  That was kind of a hobby thing that I was trying
[32:44.270 --> 32:48.070]  to learn more about the process and do it all.
[32:48.990 --> 32:51.110]  Just like the homesteading situation,
[32:51.110 --> 32:54.030]  you dive in and you try to learn what you can
[32:54.030 --> 32:56.070]  about each task.
[32:56.070 --> 32:58.310]  And that was one thing that seemed really interesting.
[32:58.310 --> 33:00.290]  So I dove in and tried it.
[33:01.230 --> 33:06.230]  But the purple unicorn is, yeah, I just used that one
[33:06.670 --> 33:09.030]  because it seems to accentuate the mother plants
[33:09.030 --> 33:12.990]  that I hid him to, but it adds this really nice
[33:12.990 --> 33:15.190]  purple-esque color sometimes.
[33:15.190 --> 33:18.350]  Although one time I crossed it to the hippie slayer,
[33:18.350 --> 33:23.350]  another abode, clone only cut, really weird rank,
[33:25.110 --> 33:28.770]  onion armpit kind of weird orders to it.
[33:30.910 --> 33:33.990]  I hit that to the purple unicorn and a friend of mine
[33:33.990 --> 33:37.430]  out in New Mexico ran a whole bunch of them
[33:37.430 --> 33:40.110]  and none of them turned purple.
[33:40.110 --> 33:43.030]  They had some purple leaves right at the very end of fall,
[33:43.030 --> 33:44.870]  but not what I was expecting at all.
[33:46.590 --> 33:50.190]  But anyways, that was an outlying circumstance.
[33:50.190 --> 33:53.070]  Normally it's been adding some purple.
[33:53.070 --> 33:55.590]  So the forbidden jelly that you saw there
[33:55.590 --> 34:00.190]  across to the purple unicorn is what you call the foreplay,
[34:00.190 --> 34:05.190]  which is chose, no, forbidden jelly times purple unicorn
[34:07.510 --> 34:08.830]  is called forbidden unicorn.
[34:08.830 --> 34:10.510]  And that's the cross that I created
[34:10.510 --> 34:12.510]  from forbidden jelly times purple unicorn.
[34:13.030 --> 34:14.510]  I've run that for a couple of seasons.
[34:14.510 --> 34:17.830]  I think that was at, I have it at an F3 currently,
[34:18.750 --> 34:23.750]  but I hit the F2 of that to the pinkleberry that I've run,
[34:23.870 --> 34:27.410]  which is from green sorts gardens.
[34:30.070 --> 34:31.550]  They've also released that
[34:31.550 --> 34:35.390]  and a couple of different generations that I have.
[34:35.390 --> 34:40.390]  This was the F7 that I hit the forbidden unicorn to.
[34:41.390 --> 34:45.150]  I hit it with that because all of the pinkleberries
[34:45.150 --> 34:47.350]  that I ran here this season,
[34:48.190 --> 34:51.690]  I had them finishing in by the second week of September.
[34:52.710 --> 34:57.030]  They seem to have not the most incredible potency,
[34:57.030 --> 34:59.270]  but they were very fast.
[34:59.270 --> 35:04.110]  So this forbidden jelly cut was one of the fastest ones
[35:04.110 --> 35:04.950]  that I have.
[35:04.950 --> 35:07.630]  So I crossed my fastest forbidden jelly cut
[35:07.630 --> 35:10.230]  to this pinkleberry and it's producing
[35:11.070 --> 35:14.070]  some of the fastest outdoor that I've created,
[35:14.070 --> 35:17.150]  finishing outdoor that I've created yet.
[35:17.150 --> 35:20.810]  I would say that it's not 1000% work through
[35:20.810 --> 35:23.750]  where it's gonna be 100% resistant to everything.
[35:23.750 --> 35:24.590]  That's for sure.
[35:24.590 --> 35:28.090]  But it performs pretty cool here.
[35:31.600 --> 35:33.920]  Is that the pinkleberry cush?
[35:33.920 --> 35:35.240]  This is crossed with Oreos.
[35:35.240 --> 35:38.680]  Yeah, another really fast flower I found,
[35:38.680 --> 35:41.320]  which was crazy because the pinkleberries,
[35:41.320 --> 35:44.960]  the males and the females kicked in so early
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.440]  that it was so far ahead of a lot of my
[35:48.440 --> 35:51.400]  traditional flowering stuff that I have here.
[35:51.400 --> 35:54.040]  So there weren't many flowers to even pollinate
[35:54.040 --> 35:58.700]  the pinkleberry with unless I saved it and such.
[35:58.700 --> 36:03.400]  But one of the really fast kicking in plants
[36:03.400 --> 36:04.880]  was the Oreos I found.
[36:04.880 --> 36:09.880]  I planted that from clone and the Oreos was incredible.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.040]  It got rained on, I just let it go.
[36:13.040 --> 36:15.400]  It was very resistant to everything.
[36:15.400 --> 36:18.360]  So structurally and resin quality wise,
[36:18.360 --> 36:22.680]  that plant was amazing outdoors here on the East Coast.
[36:22.680 --> 36:26.280]  It falls a little flat on the nose and on the palate,
[36:26.280 --> 36:29.280]  flavor wise, personally, I believe,
[36:29.280 --> 36:32.320]  but it really checked a lot of boxes.
[36:32.320 --> 36:35.000]  So I was excited to hit it with the pinkleberry
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.360]  to see if I could bring out a nose to all of that
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.720]  structure yet still have that really fast
[36:41.720 --> 36:43.500]  flowering stuff happen.
[36:50.200 --> 36:54.160]  And that little shed was the Soto breeder.
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.960]  That's where I did the breeding of that little greenhouse.
[36:58.820 --> 37:02.400]  The Soto project was started by Dutch Blooms
[37:02.400 --> 37:04.700]  at the Regen Conference.
[37:04.700 --> 37:09.700]  It was a gesture of kind of like starting this project
[37:10.900 --> 37:12.600]  as a community project.
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.440]  And that's me learning how not to grow in a greenhouse
[37:18.760 --> 37:19.700]  back in the day.
[37:19.700 --> 37:24.080]  That's how you learn.
[37:24.080 --> 37:27.240]  But anyways, the Soto project was spawned by Dutch
[37:28.560 --> 37:30.200]  on the Regen Conference.
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.440]  And he set it out as a way where the community
[37:34.440 --> 37:38.200]  could work on things together and breed things together
[37:38.200 --> 37:40.680]  and create things as a group.
[37:40.680 --> 37:44.840]  And kind of loved that idea.
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.440]  So I took the Soto, which he handed out as an F2
[37:49.440 --> 37:50.540]  to everyone.
[37:51.720 --> 37:56.300]  And it was originally started as a project by,
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.480]  it's a cross of root beer by Mean Gene
[38:01.480 --> 38:06.480]  and a project of Chemdoc Special Reserve,
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.840]  which was a project, I guess, of Kyle Cushman and Leo Stone.
[38:11.840 --> 38:14.160]  Yeah, Leo started it and then it's passed to Kevin
[38:14.160 --> 38:15.640]  and Kevin made F2s.
[38:15.640 --> 38:17.080]  Kevin made F2s.
[38:17.080 --> 38:19.520]  That's what's part of my new breeding stuff too.
[38:19.520 --> 38:22.040]  Kevin gave a lot of that seed stock from his,
[38:22.040 --> 38:24.680]  he did a large sift through the Chemdoc Special Reserve
[38:24.680 --> 38:28.160]  to find different outliers for people to line breed with.
[38:28.160 --> 38:30.680]  So you got a gene pool that could carry
[38:30.680 --> 38:32.840]  different terpene profiles and structures and stuff.
[38:32.840 --> 38:35.280]  Kevin went through and did kind of what you were talking
[38:35.280 --> 38:38.040]  about earlier by putting plants in different areas
[38:38.040 --> 38:41.040]  and seeing which ones are doing what you're looking for
[38:41.040 --> 38:43.060]  in those areas, lets you pool those to use
[38:43.060 --> 38:46.040]  for your breeding projects so that you can basically
[38:46.040 --> 38:47.980]  do old school gene typing on these plants
[38:47.980 --> 38:50.440]  to find out which ones are dominant for the trait you want.
[38:50.440 --> 38:54.580]  And he found a mango version in a female
[38:54.580 --> 38:57.760]  and a few version in a female and he's hit those
[38:57.760 --> 38:59.640]  with a male number four.
[38:59.640 --> 39:00.760]  That's the one I use here.
[39:00.760 --> 39:02.260]  And he's passed seeds to a lot of people.
[39:02.260 --> 39:03.640]  They breed awesome.
[39:03.640 --> 39:05.720]  They handle moisture great through,
[39:05.720 --> 39:09.320]  it's crazy how well with as much chem that is in that
[39:09.320 --> 39:11.080]  because that has chem D in it.
[39:11.080 --> 39:14.640]  It's got chem four in it and it's got chem A in it.
[39:14.640 --> 39:17.520]  And it's weird because the chems don't handle moisture
[39:17.520 --> 39:19.180]  as well as that plant does.
[39:19.180 --> 39:21.440]  And that plant breeds dominant when you find them
[39:21.440 --> 39:23.460]  for those terpenes, it's killer.
[39:24.600 --> 39:26.640]  You can find fast finishers.
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.400]  You can find mango, you can find fuel in there.
[39:30.400 --> 39:32.560]  You can take those and line breed.
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.640]  Yeah, they're killer.
[39:33.640 --> 39:35.360]  And they're so resistant, like you said,
[39:35.360 --> 39:37.760]  and they perform great outside.
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.320]  I took the F3 and I weighed that way myself
[39:42.320 --> 39:43.720]  and then I crossed it.
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.400]  Gushman's cut, I hit it to the Moroccan Kush.
[39:57.400 --> 40:01.460]  It's a Pakistani F2 times a Moroccan F2.
[40:01.460 --> 40:04.940]  And it is a stacker and it gives,
[40:05.900 --> 40:07.980]  I swear it's like one of those weeds that gives you
[40:07.980 --> 40:10.660]  like the squinty eye giggly fits.
[40:10.660 --> 40:15.660]  So when you cross it with that chem and that root beer,
[40:16.340 --> 40:19.120]  man, I was able to get some,
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.940]  it's not just chem dominated turps on those sodas either.
[40:22.940 --> 40:25.060]  There's root beer that comes out.
[40:26.380 --> 40:27.220]  For sure.
[40:27.220 --> 40:29.300]  But there's all kinds of other stuff here.
[40:29.340 --> 40:30.180]  Yep.
[40:31.260 --> 40:33.140]  That's this one, right?
[40:33.140 --> 40:35.180]  And then let me see if I can find the-
[40:35.180 --> 40:37.100]  Mosodo, yep.
[40:37.100 --> 40:37.940]  That's the one.
[40:40.620 --> 40:44.020]  Yeah, those things, that chem line that they've worked with,
[40:44.020 --> 40:45.340]  it breeds fucking killer.
[40:45.340 --> 40:47.180]  It's nice.
[40:47.180 --> 40:50.260]  I've used the Ghost OG Chem Dog Special Reserve
[40:50.260 --> 40:51.940]  and I've been continuing through there.
[40:51.940 --> 40:54.900]  So I've got the Ghost and a Bat Cross 2
[40:54.900 --> 40:58.460]  through the fuelious side of that to try to retain all that.
[40:58.980 --> 41:02.900]  I did a Bat Cross to the Chem D and the Chem 4
[41:02.900 --> 41:05.820]  and the Chem 91 because all that's
[41:05.820 --> 41:07.300]  from the Chem Dog Special Reserve,
[41:07.300 --> 41:10.820]  having all that from the Trest Dog in there and Double Dog,
[41:10.820 --> 41:13.160]  you end up being able to do Bat Crosses to those
[41:13.160 --> 41:15.700]  by going back to the original parent used in those.
[41:15.700 --> 41:18.940]  So those terpene profiles will come out
[41:18.940 --> 41:22.220]  and make more lines to handle your guys' kind of weather.
[41:22.220 --> 41:24.460]  Like my buddy Cooney's doing exactly what you're doing.
[41:24.460 --> 41:26.100]  He's over in your same area.
[41:26.100 --> 41:28.580]  I sent him some of my Redwood Cush Crosses,
[41:28.580 --> 41:31.140]  which are the fastest plants that I have.
[41:31.140 --> 41:34.100]  And he's hit those to some of his favorite stuff
[41:34.100 --> 41:35.500]  that contain Durban in it.
[41:35.500 --> 41:38.820]  And it's knocked their timeframe down extremely far.
[41:38.820 --> 41:40.940]  He's found a couple of the outliers that work
[41:40.940 --> 41:44.180]  in your guys' area with the moisture way better.
[41:44.180 --> 41:46.300]  And he's starting to use those to select through
[41:46.300 --> 41:47.140]  to do some breeding.
[41:47.140 --> 41:49.900]  So he's got seed stocks that will grow better
[41:49.900 --> 41:51.860]  in your guys' area.
[41:51.860 --> 41:53.140]  And it goes to breeding.
[41:53.140 --> 41:54.340]  You have to do the work.
[41:54.340 --> 41:56.380]  When you start becoming a farmer and a steward,
[41:56.380 --> 41:58.060]  like we're all doing,
[41:58.060 --> 42:01.820]  saving seeds becomes like second nature.
[42:01.820 --> 42:04.660]  At first it feels like it's something I can't do.
[42:04.660 --> 42:07.080]  And then it feels like it's something that I have to do.
[42:07.080 --> 42:09.500]  Then it feels like something I should be doing.
[42:09.500 --> 42:10.980]  And then it just becomes second nature.
[42:10.980 --> 42:13.220]  And every year you're making the continuation
[42:13.220 --> 42:15.340]  of something special in your garden.
[42:15.340 --> 42:17.780]  We should all be doing that regionally.
[42:17.780 --> 42:20.420]  If you have the ability to put pollen on some plants
[42:20.420 --> 42:22.760]  and save even a handful of seeds,
[42:22.760 --> 42:25.080]  you should be doing that if you're growing plants.
[42:25.080 --> 42:27.520]  There could be a time when those could be
[42:27.520 --> 42:28.900]  what saves our asses.
[42:30.480 --> 42:31.320]  For real.
[42:31.320 --> 42:33.560]  Yeah, and there's nothing more sad than when you tap
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.800]  into those special ones that are just too old
[42:35.800 --> 42:37.520]  and they're not quite popping anymore.
[42:37.520 --> 42:39.440]  And you didn't quite get to opening them up
[42:39.440 --> 42:42.240]  or re-preserving them and refreshing them.
[42:42.240 --> 42:45.040]  So it's a never ending battle,
[42:45.040 --> 42:46.240]  especially when you're dealing
[42:46.240 --> 42:48.880]  with such extreme number restrictions.
[42:50.300 --> 42:52.180]  So it takes all of us, man.
[42:53.440 --> 42:54.320]  Yep.
[42:54.320 --> 42:55.560]  Now, if you're gonna do extension,
[42:55.560 --> 42:57.760]  like some of the old stuff in the forums back in the day,
[42:57.760 --> 42:59.840]  I remember reading from Tom Hill.
[42:59.840 --> 43:01.320]  He would take four by four tents
[43:01.320 --> 43:03.320]  and fill it with as many five by five pots
[43:03.320 --> 43:05.520]  and flower plants, five inches tall,
[43:05.520 --> 43:07.800]  but all the males and females pollinate
[43:07.800 --> 43:09.280]  and just collect that seed stock.
[43:09.280 --> 43:11.480]  You're not looking for selection at that point.
[43:11.480 --> 43:13.960]  You're just looking to make a continuation of that line
[43:13.960 --> 43:16.800]  with as much of the gene pool possible.
[43:16.800 --> 43:18.560]  Without narrowing it down.
[43:18.560 --> 43:19.920]  There is the restrictions,
[43:19.920 --> 43:23.720]  but you can always have a two by four somewhere.
[43:23.720 --> 43:25.480]  Nobody's looking at to do that.
[43:25.480 --> 43:27.240]  It only takes a small amount of time
[43:27.240 --> 43:29.360]  with like 10 days of veg,
[43:29.360 --> 43:31.160]  six weeks of flower,
[43:31.160 --> 43:33.400]  harvest those seeds and you've got a continuation.
[43:33.400 --> 43:35.000]  Outside it's even easier.
[43:35.000 --> 43:36.240]  You can take plants and put them out
[43:36.240 --> 43:37.880]  at the end of the season,
[43:37.880 --> 43:40.400]  like very small plants and just let them finish out there.
[43:40.400 --> 43:41.240]  Yeah.
[43:41.240 --> 43:42.200]  And hand pollinate.
[43:42.200 --> 43:44.240]  And make your larger stock.
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.840]  Yeah, just get that larger amount of that gene pool
[43:47.840 --> 43:50.280]  and quit trying to narrow it down
[43:50.280 --> 43:54.640]  to the smallest selection of two plants.
[43:54.640 --> 43:56.880]  Trevor made a killer post that shows it visually
[43:56.880 --> 43:59.960]  with a jar that has colored BBs in it.
[43:59.960 --> 44:02.720]  And you go through and select just two of those BBs
[44:02.720 --> 44:03.960]  and end up with a gene pool
[44:03.960 --> 44:06.520]  that can only produce those two colors.
[44:06.520 --> 44:08.840]  When you want to find some of the others later,
[44:08.840 --> 44:10.440]  you eventually won't be able to do it
[44:10.440 --> 44:12.120]  because they were removed
[44:12.120 --> 44:15.160]  from narrowing down the selection every time.
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.120]  If you want to preserve a line,
[44:18.120 --> 44:19.840]  open it up as much as possible.
[44:21.080 --> 44:21.920]  First thing.
[44:22.840 --> 44:23.680]  Agreed.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.120]  And here, can you see this?
[44:29.120 --> 44:29.960]  Yeah.
[44:29.960 --> 44:33.600]  That's the soto fountain.
[44:33.600 --> 44:34.880]  The soto fountain, yeah.
[44:34.880 --> 44:36.560]  So that's the F2.
[44:38.200 --> 44:40.940]  I hunted out a few of the,
[44:43.080 --> 44:46.280]  well, a few that I ended up keeping of the soto males.
[44:46.600 --> 44:51.600]  And I used those on the Gushmint's cut that I have
[44:53.680 --> 44:57.920]  that is a really incredible looker,
[44:57.920 --> 45:00.080]  incredible quality resin,
[45:00.080 --> 45:02.780]  just a real nice plant all the way around.
[45:04.520 --> 45:05.360]  That one,
[45:08.120 --> 45:13.000]  that one is, it probably goes a little bit long
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.440]  for outdoor in some areas.
[45:16.280 --> 45:17.880]  It's pushing the boundaries for sure
[45:17.880 --> 45:20.720]  as far as weeks of flowering go,
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.200]  but the quality is outrageous, so it can be worth it.
[45:24.200 --> 45:27.920]  And if you have the right situation set up, I would say.
[45:32.550 --> 45:37.010]  And then this was the soto, right?
[45:38.270 --> 45:39.550]  The Mo Soto, yep.
[45:39.550 --> 45:42.270]  That was the Moroccan Kush,
[45:42.270 --> 45:45.350]  Moroccan F2 times Pakistani F2.
[45:45.350 --> 45:49.190]  That one is, the Moroccan Kush itself
[45:50.030 --> 45:55.030]  is a serious performer here, pretty resistant.
[45:55.230 --> 45:56.630]  It stacks like crazy.
[45:56.630 --> 46:00.110]  There's a photo I think you might have of that one.
[46:00.110 --> 46:01.910]  It stacks like crazy
[46:01.910 --> 46:06.510]  and it produces squinty-eyed giggle fits like no other.
[46:06.510 --> 46:09.510]  I just love the effects off of that stuff.
[46:09.510 --> 46:12.150]  So being a proven winner,
[46:12.150 --> 46:16.590]  I hit it to the soto males as well.
[46:19.630 --> 46:21.710]  So that one is,
[46:23.870 --> 46:26.350]  I have, yeah, that one's awesome.
[46:26.350 --> 46:27.590]  Both of those are,
[46:27.590 --> 46:30.710]  any of those sotos have been producing really cool,
[46:30.710 --> 46:35.630]  unique, good outdoor, solid outdoor plants.
[46:37.590 --> 46:41.070]  The other one you had there was the East Coast Snow Blower,
[46:41.070 --> 46:44.010]  which is the Lemon Snow Cone times Lemon Lollipops.
[46:44.010 --> 46:46.190]  The Lemon Snow Cone is a,
[46:47.190 --> 46:51.590]  one we've been running here for some time now
[46:51.590 --> 46:54.790]  and continuing the line.
[46:54.790 --> 46:59.270]  It's not your typical Lemon Turps.
[46:59.270 --> 47:01.350]  It's a Lemon Tree times,
[47:01.350 --> 47:04.510]  Lemon Snow Cone is Lemon Tree times Super Lemon Haze,
[47:05.670 --> 47:07.830]  but it generally brings this
[47:07.830 --> 47:11.150]  not one note Lemon Tree, Lemon thing.
[47:11.150 --> 47:14.590]  It's got a really smooth, creamy,
[47:15.150 --> 47:17.470]  creamy lemon type of thing,
[47:17.470 --> 47:21.070]  like a sugar pastry kind of lemon.
[47:21.070 --> 47:23.590]  It has incredible resin.
[47:23.590 --> 47:27.830]  It really dumps resin, especially for outdoor plants.
[47:29.070 --> 47:32.390]  And so we've been using that one for a while.
[47:32.390 --> 47:36.070]  And Lemon Lollipops is,
[47:36.070 --> 47:38.750]  I was lucky enough to test out a bunch of stuff
[47:38.750 --> 47:41.750]  for Professor P, Dynasty Genetics.
[47:41.750 --> 47:43.630]  It's one of his crosses.
[47:43.630 --> 47:48.390]  Lemon Lollipops is Oregon Lemons
[47:48.390 --> 47:51.510]  times Blue Magoo Bat Cross too.
[47:52.710 --> 47:56.230]  And I found some really awesome stuff out of there
[47:56.230 --> 47:58.630]  and some really cool males.
[47:58.630 --> 48:02.830]  So I crossed, those seem to have finished up
[48:02.830 --> 48:06.110]  really nicely at the end, bulked up, colored up,
[48:06.110 --> 48:09.250]  nice solid, solid flowers.
[48:09.410 --> 48:14.410]  There are not a incredible bold in your face lemon
[48:14.730 --> 48:15.570]  by any means.
[48:15.570 --> 48:20.570]  It's kind of like a really light, airy blueberry lemon,
[48:23.290 --> 48:27.050]  hint of lavender kind of thing going on in those.
[48:27.050 --> 48:30.690]  Real nice in the Lemon Lollipops,
[48:30.690 --> 48:32.330]  not too heavy by any means,
[48:32.330 --> 48:35.010]  kind of like just a really comfortable effects
[48:35.010 --> 48:37.970]  and smooth flavors.
[48:38.010 --> 48:43.010]  So I'm hoping to just bring in some of that Blue Magoo
[48:44.970 --> 48:48.690]  into that Lemon Snow Cone line with this cross
[48:48.690 --> 48:52.050]  and just accentuate that resin quality
[48:52.050 --> 48:53.610]  as an outdoor plant here.
[48:53.610 --> 48:57.610]  And I think that this one's been cruising
[48:59.570 --> 49:01.170]  towards that direction faster.
[49:01.170 --> 49:06.170]  So Chad, I take your point.
[49:09.250 --> 49:11.850]  So why don't we go one by one?
[49:11.850 --> 49:13.650]  I know you've kind of touched on some of them,
[49:13.650 --> 49:16.090]  but right down the line.
[49:16.090 --> 49:19.570]  So this was the East Coast Snow Blower.
[49:19.570 --> 49:21.570]  You're just kind of talking about that, right?
[49:21.570 --> 49:26.570]  Yep, so that was the Lemon Snow Cone times Lemon Lollipops.
[49:27.570 --> 49:32.570]  Lemon Snow Cone is the Lemon Tree times Super Lemon Haze.
[49:33.770 --> 49:38.770]  And it's been a producer here in Western Mass for us
[49:38.770 --> 49:40.930]  for a few years now.
[49:40.930 --> 49:44.770]  We've continued it a few generations forward
[49:44.770 --> 49:46.170]  in different directions.
[49:48.730 --> 49:50.890]  And we love it.
[49:50.890 --> 49:51.730]  It's a performer.
[49:51.730 --> 49:53.890]  It's really good for the resin quality
[49:53.890 --> 49:58.890]  and loud, creamy lemon terpenes or aromas.
[50:00.610 --> 50:05.210]  The Lemon Lollipop that is crossed, the male we chose is,
[50:07.090 --> 50:09.690]  the Lemon Lollipops was bred
[50:09.690 --> 50:12.170]  by Professor P. of Dynasty Genetics.
[50:12.170 --> 50:17.170]  It's Oregon Lemons times Blue Magoo BX2.
[50:18.170 --> 50:23.170]  And by using that one, like I said,
[50:23.530 --> 50:25.610]  trying to get some of that Blue Magoo,
[50:25.610 --> 50:28.890]  which we all, well, some of us all know and love
[50:29.770 --> 50:34.010]  into that Lemon Snow Cone, which we love here
[50:34.010 --> 50:39.010]  and just really create some really incredible resin quality.
[50:39.450 --> 50:42.090]  So that's kind of the goal with that one.
[50:42.090 --> 50:44.090]  It's a real yielder, super prolific.
[50:44.090 --> 50:47.330]  It's been not much, I mean, this past year
[50:47.330 --> 50:49.810]  in Western Mass and the Northeast,
[50:49.810 --> 50:53.010]  I want to warn everybody that if it was their first time
[50:54.010 --> 50:55.410]  this past year, it was a dream.
[50:55.410 --> 50:57.890]  It was like the nicest finish to a season
[50:57.890 --> 50:59.050]  we could have ever had.
[50:59.050 --> 51:04.050]  So be prepared for much worse as a usual.
[51:05.410 --> 51:08.690]  So yeah, this is genetics that have performed here
[51:08.690 --> 51:11.730]  and I'm just trying to continue that along
[51:11.730 --> 51:12.770]  in different directions.
[51:12.770 --> 51:15.090]  So that was the idea with that one.
[51:15.090 --> 51:19.610]  And for those just tuning in, here is in New England.
[51:19.610 --> 51:20.450]  Correct.
[51:21.450 --> 51:25.250]  Okay, so this one going down the line.
[51:25.250 --> 51:29.490]  Yep, Mosodo Moroccan Kush is a Moroccan F2
[51:29.490 --> 51:33.130]  times Pakistani F2, which we've also hunted out
[51:33.130 --> 51:38.130]  and tested here for it's, all of it's,
[51:39.570 --> 51:40.810]  it's just been awesome.
[51:40.810 --> 51:44.370]  I really, really, really love the way it produces.
[51:44.370 --> 51:48.370]  It stacks up really fast and quickly.
[51:48.850 --> 51:50.930]  A lot of times here in the Northeast,
[51:50.930 --> 51:52.530]  what I'm looking for when I'm selecting
[51:52.530 --> 51:55.170]  are the ones that are going to put on that weight
[51:55.170 --> 51:57.530]  a lot on that beginning half too,
[51:57.530 --> 51:59.050]  instead of just at the end,
[51:59.050 --> 52:01.650]  because that's where a lot of selections
[52:01.650 --> 52:03.770]  are going to fall flat here in the Northeast
[52:03.770 --> 52:06.450]  is if it's all in the last two weeks,
[52:06.450 --> 52:08.770]  that's a lot of times where you're going to lose
[52:08.770 --> 52:10.450]  the most of your chances.
[52:10.450 --> 52:15.450]  So choosing plants for their stacking up earlier on
[52:15.730 --> 52:18.530]  in the season is a benefit to all for the,
[52:18.530 --> 52:23.490]  just the amount of flower that you can create outdoor.
[52:24.530 --> 52:28.370]  It also has been incredibly potent in a way that I love.
[52:28.370 --> 52:29.370]  I can't explain it.
[52:29.370 --> 52:34.010]  It literally has been doing like the squinky eyed
[52:34.010 --> 52:35.450]  giggle fits is what I call it.
[52:35.450 --> 52:38.770]  I literally just sit there and giggle and laugh.
[52:38.770 --> 52:41.170]  I just love the effects off of that plant.
[52:41.170 --> 52:43.450]  So it's been performing here forever.
[52:43.450 --> 52:48.090]  So it was a no brainer to hit that to the Soto
[52:48.090 --> 52:51.330]  because the Soto's have been just so awesome here,
[52:51.330 --> 52:53.330]  right from the jump, they created something,
[52:53.330 --> 52:55.530]  like Tony said, that you can breed with.
[52:55.530 --> 52:56.930]  It's just awesome.
[52:56.930 --> 53:00.090]  They perform outdoors like it's nobody's business.
[53:00.090 --> 53:03.210]  I did what he said, which was with the Soto's,
[53:03.210 --> 53:06.050]  I planted a bunch of them in tubs
[53:06.050 --> 53:11.050]  where I could get a bigger view of what I was looking at
[53:11.450 --> 53:13.250]  because they were small.
[53:14.010 --> 53:15.690]  But I could still really see all their characteristics
[53:15.690 --> 53:17.290]  and what they were bringing to the table.
[53:17.290 --> 53:20.090]  So that really helped me find the Soto's
[53:20.090 --> 53:21.450]  that I wanted to work with.
[53:23.410 --> 53:27.290]  So this is that one of my all-star plants
[53:27.290 --> 53:29.010]  crossed to the Soto.
[53:31.570 --> 53:32.610]  Got it.
[53:32.610 --> 53:34.930]  And then next up.
[53:34.930 --> 53:35.770]  The foreplay.
[53:35.770 --> 53:36.930]  Foreplay.
[53:36.930 --> 53:39.530]  Yeah, I went into detail about earlier.
[53:39.530 --> 53:42.210]  That one was for its speed.
[53:42.210 --> 53:44.890]  The forbidden unicorn is a cross of forbidden jelly
[53:44.890 --> 53:46.090]  times purple unicorn.
[53:46.090 --> 53:48.770]  The forbidden jelly is a selection
[53:48.770 --> 53:52.410]  that I made some years ago now out of a hunt
[53:52.410 --> 53:55.250]  that was just very unique from the pack.
[53:56.490 --> 54:01.490]  Spicy, incensy, just really cool outlier.
[54:02.050 --> 54:04.250]  So I've ran with that.
[54:07.010 --> 54:10.490]  I crossed it to the purple unicorn
[54:10.490 --> 54:13.210]  and it created a really awesome,
[54:13.210 --> 54:16.130]  super fast flowering dark purple plant.
[54:16.130 --> 54:19.170]  It's literally just dark, dark purple from the beginning.
[54:24.090 --> 54:27.890]  Because it was so fast, I hit it to the pinkleberry.
[54:34.310 --> 54:35.150]  What?
[54:38.870 --> 54:40.950]  Go back to I hit it with the pinkleberry.
[54:42.350 --> 54:45.390]  So then I hit it with the pinkleberry.
[54:46.350 --> 54:49.790]  F7 male that I chose.
[54:52.750 --> 54:57.750]  The result is a super fast finishing flower.
[55:00.270 --> 55:02.150]  So I hit it with the pinkleberry.
[55:02.150 --> 55:02.990]  Take three.
[55:05.860 --> 55:07.940]  I hit it with the pinkleberry.
[55:07.940 --> 55:11.620]  It was an F7 male that I chose for its structure
[55:11.620 --> 55:13.700]  and its speed.
[55:15.620 --> 55:20.620]  The result is a very fast flowering plant
[55:20.860 --> 55:25.140]  that's pretty resilient and dark purple.
[55:25.140 --> 55:28.660]  And it brings along a lot of the pinkleberry terpenes
[55:29.540 --> 55:32.460]  and some more complicated citrus, I would say.
[55:32.460 --> 55:34.900]  So it's kind of like a citrus floral
[55:35.100 --> 55:40.100]  and yeah, citrus floral range,
[55:41.340 --> 55:45.020]  I would say is where you're gonna find the aromas.
[55:45.020 --> 55:47.260]  But that one is designed for fast.
[55:50.380 --> 55:55.300]  The platinum swabby punch times Hindu kush.
[55:55.300 --> 55:57.020]  The platinum swabby punch was,
[55:57.020 --> 56:00.420]  I was part of the One World, One Plant thing
[56:00.420 --> 56:02.580]  that in-house genetics did,
[56:02.580 --> 56:05.020]  which was a big hunt of some genetics.
[56:06.020 --> 56:08.300]  I guess there's some drama behind all of that.
[56:08.300 --> 56:09.860]  I won't get into it too deep,
[56:09.860 --> 56:13.260]  but the platinum swabby times platinum punch
[56:13.260 --> 56:16.860]  was the plant that I was given to hunt out.
[56:16.860 --> 56:21.860]  And not the plant, the seeds that were given to hunt out.
[56:22.060 --> 56:25.900]  I already had the platinum punch cut
[56:25.900 --> 56:27.940]  that we had hunted out already.
[56:27.940 --> 56:31.860]  And I didn't really want anything that was in that realm.
[56:32.180 --> 56:35.660]  So I was interested in the swabby side of things.
[56:35.660 --> 56:38.380]  So I just picked the furthest leaning plant
[56:38.380 --> 56:41.620]  I could find in that direction,
[56:41.620 --> 56:45.140]  which turned out to be this like straight cheese smell.
[56:45.140 --> 56:48.060]  It's just the cheesiest, cheesy smell.
[56:48.060 --> 56:50.460]  It turns dark maroon.
[56:50.460 --> 56:51.740]  It's a beautiful plant.
[56:52.780 --> 56:56.180]  It finished really well outside after testing it.
[56:56.180 --> 57:01.180]  After growing it, hunting it out, I grew it outside here.
[57:01.260 --> 57:02.380]  It performed awesome.
[57:02.380 --> 57:06.100]  It creates some really, just really cheese.
[57:06.100 --> 57:08.300]  I've never smelled anything so cheesy.
[57:10.380 --> 57:13.580]  So what I did was I crossed it to the Hindu Kush.
[57:13.580 --> 57:16.060]  The Hindu Kush I got, believe it or not,
[57:16.060 --> 57:20.780]  on another fundraising FCP thing, I believe,
[57:20.780 --> 57:23.180]  for Duke Diamond back in the day.
[57:23.180 --> 57:25.900]  Dutch was putting up some Hindu that he
[57:25.900 --> 57:30.900]  had in his, given to him by Kevin, I believe, Kevin Jodry.
[57:32.260 --> 57:35.380]  So I hunted those out at the same time
[57:35.380 --> 57:36.900]  as I was doing that project.
[57:36.900 --> 57:40.540]  And it made sense to cross the two of those to get maybe,
[57:40.540 --> 57:42.300]  because I already picked the real,
[57:43.540 --> 57:46.820]  kind of the swabby leaning side of that original cross
[57:46.820 --> 57:47.980]  to hit it with the Hindu
[57:47.980 --> 57:52.220]  and just to create some more unique type profiles.
[57:52.220 --> 57:53.660]  The Hindus all had bright,
[57:53.900 --> 57:54.940]  type profiles.
[57:54.940 --> 57:58.620]  The Hindus all had bright pink and hairs on the flowers.
[57:58.620 --> 58:03.620]  Really cool, visual appealing plants
[58:03.660 --> 58:06.420]  similar to the pinkleberry in that effect a little bit.
[58:08.020 --> 58:12.660]  And the cross, yeah,
[58:12.660 --> 58:14.900]  it's gonna perform pretty awesome out here.
[58:14.900 --> 58:19.060]  I'm super pumped about that one in particular.
[58:19.060 --> 58:21.700]  That one hasn't been hunted out that much yet,
[58:21.700 --> 58:24.820]  but I know that there's some super gems in it.
[58:28.180 --> 58:30.500]  So I, there's some questions in the chat,
[58:30.500 --> 58:32.540]  but let me just quickly get through.
[58:33.980 --> 58:35.580]  We got two more.
[58:35.580 --> 58:37.020]  Okay.
[58:37.020 --> 58:38.860]  Pocket mulch.
[58:38.860 --> 58:41.060]  Hippie Slayer times lemon lollipops.
[58:41.060 --> 58:44.700]  Hippie Slayer I've had in the arsenal for a few years now.
[58:44.700 --> 58:48.980]  I believe it was gifted to me by a dog at Elite Finos,
[58:48.980 --> 58:51.580]  a company out of Massachusetts here.
[58:52.580 --> 58:54.220]  They do tissue culture and such.
[58:56.140 --> 59:00.020]  He gave me that cut a while ago and yeah,
[59:00.020 --> 59:03.060]  it kind of something about it stood out as an old school.
[59:03.060 --> 59:05.460]  It really reminded me of some old school stuff.
[59:05.460 --> 59:10.460]  It had that like weird skunk oniony kind of vibes
[59:11.220 --> 59:14.140]  that we used to get tapping into some super skunks
[59:14.140 --> 59:15.300]  or whatever.
[59:15.300 --> 59:19.540]  It had a lot of that weird skunky onion armpit stuff.
[59:19.540 --> 59:20.380]  I loved.
[59:21.300 --> 59:22.220]  I've kept it around.
[59:22.220 --> 59:24.540]  It performs pretty well outside.
[59:27.340 --> 59:31.020]  And I thought that it would be a really cool idea
[59:31.020 --> 59:35.580]  to hit it with that lemon lollipops mail that I was using.
[59:35.580 --> 59:37.540]  And it seems to have,
[59:41.260 --> 59:45.700]  surprisingly it's created a lot of terpene profiles
[59:45.700 --> 59:47.420]  that I wasn't expecting.
[59:47.420 --> 59:49.900]  So it could be all kinds of things, believe it or not.
[59:50.420 --> 59:53.300]  I thought that the Hippie Slayer was going to bring
[59:53.300 --> 59:56.700]  a certain onion funk type of thing all the time
[59:56.700 --> 59:58.020]  like I was just talking about,
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.260]  but in the crosses that I've used to it,
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.660]  it seems to open up it a little bit.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.980]  And I've had all kinds of things like for instance,
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.220]  the Hippie Slayer types purple unicorn
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.980]  had pineapple aromas coming out of it.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.500]  So, I mean, with the Hippie Slayer,
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:22.020]  I found that it kind of opens up the Pandora's box
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:26.180]  a little bit of aromas and different kinds of flavors.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:29.540]  They all seem to be structurally solid
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.980]  and beefy and producers,
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:35.860]  but the terpenes are where the differences have been.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.780]  Okay, let me go.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.060]  We got one.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:45.900]  Oh, here we go.
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.460]  You see that one?
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.140]  Soto Fountain, yeah.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.580]  Okay, so the Soto Fountain is a real performer.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.340]  The Gushments is a performer here.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.260]  I just liked it.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:10.260]  It's got a high test in all of them.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.140]  All of the tests test high.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.620]  It's potent, it's flavorful.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.460]  It's got the eye candy.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.140]  It performed outside.
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.340]  It was pretty all around great plant.
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:29.860]  So again, it was just another part of my Soto project.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:37.700]  I had one space and I wanted to start that Soto project.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.020]  My idea was to get them out to as many folks as possible
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.020]  so that we can continue what Dutch
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:49.180]  was kind of saying with it.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.820]  And when you reached out about this,
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.860]  it seemed like the perfect kind of genetics
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.460]  to get out to the folks
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.220]  with that community vibe behind it from the beginning.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:07.500]  So the Gushments is just another one of the Soto project,
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.980]  which is the root beer times Chemdog Special Reserve.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.180]  The Chemdog Special Reserve is Chem4 times Stardog.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.180]  Got it.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.180]  So the question which we kind of covered earlier,
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.020]  do you test your gear outside as well?
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.220]  And then someone from Maine,
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.820]  what we Mainers strive for.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.020]  That's kind of what you're all,
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.380]  I mean, you're in Massachusetts.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.940]  You're a stone's throw from Maine, you're Western Mass.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.780]  I'm a seasonal.
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.300]  You got hair on your chest.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.180]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.100]  I'm no Flatlander, that's for sure.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.220]  It's, yeah, I would say that I only,
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.740]  all my projects are outdoors
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.740]  and testing happens for indoors for viability there.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.180]  And just for continuing things in the winter,
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:08.900]  just to kind of explore and follow things
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.020]  on an indoor basis.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.300]  But my passion is always like outdoors.
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:17.180]  So all of these projects have been performed outdoors
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.140]  with the exception of some of the hunts,
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.180]  but all of the hunts happen outdoors as well.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:26.260]  But it's a slow process as everyone knows.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.740]  And then, okay.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.620]  So this is a garden question.
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:39.700]  Let me make it so you can see it.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:43.620]  You're doing so much for the plant.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.900]  Can you ask Richie about why eating his food
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.300]  from his garden is so important for his gut biome
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.260]  and then the follow-up,
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.820]  or I should say how he healed his gut biome
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.740]  and became healthy because of this lifestyle
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:57.060]  and change of life he decided to take on?
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.620]  Sure.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:05.260]  It's a similar story to others in the community.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.260]  I, late in life, it started later on in life,
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.100]  I was diagnosed with celiac disease.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.900]  So I didn't realize I was kind of poisoning myself
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.540]  with everything I was eating.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:24.540]  And then after I got a grasp on that
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.260]  and started to try to heal my body,
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.100]  which was a very slow process,
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.740]  not understanding everything
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.540]  and not having the doctors really on the same page
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.660]  in the beginning when everyone was learning about celiac.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.980]  So I had gone a long time in life,
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.820]  eating a lot of things that weren't working for my body.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:50.820]  The deal with celiac is if you're eating,
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.780]  my body feels like if I eat anything
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:56.540]  that has gluten in it is allergic to it.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.860]  My body feels like it's going to fight it off,
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.940]  like it's toxic.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:04.940]  And it has all these villi in your intestines that go down
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.540]  that kind of take the nutrients out of your food
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.940]  as it goes down through your system.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.100]  And if you have celiac
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:16.300]  and you've been eating gluten for so long or too long,
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:21.300]  those villi burn out and there's like little corroded nubs
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.300]  instead of the healthy things,
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.900]  getting all the nutrients from your food.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.020]  So even if you're eating food,
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.940]  you're not soaking the nutrients out of that food
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:31.660]  that your body intends.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.580]  So that was the first part of the health thing,
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.460]  but I didn't quite understand that.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:43.460]  It wasn't until I got Lyme disease on top of it
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.500]  and I got it really bad.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.660]  I had to go to the hospital.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.660]  I was in IV antibiotics for over a month.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.340]  I was in the hospital for a while.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.780]  I had Bell's palsy.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.100]  It paralyzed my face.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.820]  It was just really scary, really messed me up.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:05.380]  But the worst part was the antibiotics
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:09.540]  and how it totally destroyed my gut biome.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:13.220]  I all of a sudden started to be like allergic to dairy
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.140]  and all of these other things.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.620]  I couldn't quite figure it out.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.420]  I had to eliminate just about everything from my diet.
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:25.500]  And I started to focus on this place
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.900]  and all natural food only, which was not me.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:33.340]  I was raised like a lot of other people with sugar
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.820]  and just unhealthy, working as a landscaper,
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.380]  gas station food as my lunch,
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.340]  just like bag of chips in a Slim Jim type of thing
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.180]  back in the day.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:51.180]  But I evolved and now I got so sick
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.940]  and I couldn't eat anything.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:55.700]  And I literally had to eliminate everything out of my diet.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.980]  And slowly I started realizing that the things I could eat
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.020]  were all the things that nature provided for us right there.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.460]  Messed with, unbothered, everything I could eat
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.980]  was right in front of me.
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.820]  So we started focusing on growing everything here,
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.300]  making everything we could ourselves,
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.180]  not going out to restaurants
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:20.180]  where people didn't understand how insanely small pieces
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.900]  I can get poisoned by.
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.060]  It's like, no offense,
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.300]  but I just can't really go out to restaurants
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.580]  because it makes me sick,
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.140]  even when people are really trying.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.140]  So it was just this whole major kick in my gut really
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.820]  that life gave me that made me slow down,
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.500]  realize what I was eating.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.780]  And when I replaced all of that stuff
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.780]  with this natural food and micro,
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.860]  just all of it, it's changed.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.540]  All park, what year were you diagnosed with celiacs?
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.580]  Celiac was around, geez,
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:09.060]  I would say 2010 or eight,
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.540]  somewhere around 2008 or 10.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:17.060]  So about 15, 13 to 15 years ago.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.900]  Yeah.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.100]  Yeah.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.060]  And at the time my doctors weren't really giving me
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.220]  clear answers about it.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.620]  It seemed kind of new to everybody at the time.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.260]  It's a more known thing now,
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.980]  but anyways, yeah.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.580]  So the Lyme disease, the eating healthy,
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.580]  and now I feel stronger than I've been in a long time.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.260]  I feel focused.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.940]  I feel happy.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.140]  We're, you know, we're not,
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:50.500]  just it opened my eyes to what success really is
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.980]  and what health really is
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.900]  and what means the most in life
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:58.060]  and it's health and time.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.620]  Those are like the two commodities that I found to be like,
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.540]  you know, of prime importance in my life these days.
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:10.620]  So spending quality time
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:15.380]  and living the healthiest life I can
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.860]  has really inspired me to do a lot of things.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.820]  It's changed my mental attitude dramatically as well.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.980]  It's changed my circle that I'm with is more focused.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:27.100]  It's great meeting more,
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.260]  just
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.220]  and very grateful.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.580]  We'll wait for you to come back.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.740]  For the opportunity to be able to start.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.300]  All right, you're back.
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.940]  Sorry, you glitched out for a second there.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:49.820]  Did you go to the event this past weekend?
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.660]  Was that in Sturbridge or something?
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.060]  You're very frozen again.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:56.900]  What's up?
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.700]  Did you go to the event?
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.100]  I lost that last question.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.460]  Did you go to the event this past weekend?
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.620]  That was in, that Wendy did
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.380]  and what was it, Sturbridge or something?
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.740]  Yeah, the Super Soil Conference.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.940]  I really wanted to.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.780]  I was on my list, but I'm juggling so many things right now.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.540]  I had an important meeting that I really had to attend.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:24.580]  I was able to cruise out there
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.300]  to say hi to a couple of folks real quick.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.820]  I said hi to Chef Alex
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.780]  and John Gross Space Killa,
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.700]  two really amazing dudes out doing the real good work here.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.020]  I was able to hook up with them
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.700]  and they gave me some incredible flour
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.020]  and we just hung out for a little while,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.620]  talked genetics and plans.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:48.340]  But no, I was not able to go up too much to my chagrin.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:53.940]  But it's on my list for next year for sure.
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:55.660]  Got it.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.660]  And Alex said, I guess the next time he sees you,
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.940]  he's gonna share some of Tony's gear with you.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.020]  Yeah, I just sent some stuff over there to him.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.340]  I can send you guys some more
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.260]  if you guys wanna play with some stuff, man.
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.380]  He showed up there wearing my shirt at the event over here
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.220]  and I was so stoked.
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.740]  I was like, right on, man.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.940]  Give me, just hit me up.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.300]  I'm gonna send you some more stuff to play with.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.140]  Right on.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:19.180]  That's cool.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.100]  Much respect.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.820]  So just quickly, I got a boogie
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:27.180]  to deal with some family stuff.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:32.180]  But again, I love, and hopefully next time you come on,
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.940]  Alex can jump on with you so you guys can riff
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.380]  like a jazz duo.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.540]  You guys can riff off each other,
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.380]  which I thought would be cool
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.820]  because you guys know each other more than I know you.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.620]  Believe me, anytime I can be of help
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.740]  to what you guys have going on, I'd be more than happy.
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:56.340]  So yeah, thanks for the opportunity.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.660]  I appreciate it.
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.620]  And yeah, we'll be doing some more of these,
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:05.620]  but I just wanted to kind of just get something started.
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:12.340]  But we got a wheelchair heading to a new home,
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.180]  which should be there in the next week.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.420]  Send me the gear chair, I'll let you know.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.860]  And I'll probably jump on here and show everyone.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.460]  I'll do a real quick fucking reveal.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.300]  I might show the unboxing.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.140]  Pops and Willys.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.220]  I wanted to do the unboxing of it here.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.140]  So if it's clear enough outside,
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.780]  I'm gonna go outside and set up my camera
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.780]  and let you guys watch me unbox it
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.180]  and switch from the chair I'm in right now
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.700]  over to the one that literally
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.700]  is gonna make my life way easier.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.580]  And that's because of all of you people.
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.900]  Even if you didn't help in anything
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.860]  other than just being here and pushing the like button,
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.420]  you helped, so thank you.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.780]  Thank you all.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.780]  And Rich, thank you.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.260]  And yeah, why don't we wrap it there?
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:00.060]  I'm gonna be jumping on tonight at about nine
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.420]  with a woman grower, which we don't feature enough of.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.860]  And I fully admit and acknowledge that.
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.900]  So I'm excited for that.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:09.740]  And-
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.900]  I've tried to get Jen to come on now,
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.740]  but she doesn't wanna do it.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.300]  The 707 seed bank we got tomorrow.
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.900]  Go ahead, what'd you say?
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.700]  Oh, I said I tried to get Jen to come on here.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.020]  She grows killer weed,
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.380]  but she doesn't wanna come on and do it.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.340]  I wish she would.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.580]  Yeah, we need to have more female content on here
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.380]  because there are some killer growers out here
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.020]  that the plant calls to all of us.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.700]  It ain't just the dudes.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.180]  And it's calling to everyone.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.460]  Yes, so with that,
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.460]  and I'm sure we have a whole bunch of other stuff going on
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.460]  that's just off the top of my head, what I can remember.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:51.500]  But anyway, everyone have a good Friday
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.180]  and I'll be back in a couple hours.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.020]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:55.860]  Thank you.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.700]  See you, everybody.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.620]  See you, everyone.
