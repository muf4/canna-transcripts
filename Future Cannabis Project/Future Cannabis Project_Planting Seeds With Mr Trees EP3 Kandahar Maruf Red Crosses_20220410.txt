[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  and
[00:02.040 --> 00:04.040]  We get we get good feedback
[00:04.320 --> 00:06.320]  and I also trade a
[00:06.840 --> 00:09.020]  bunch of green tomatoes for some
[00:09.760 --> 00:11.760]  some tomatillo sauce
[00:12.840 --> 00:19.480]  Nice and some some tamales from some ladies that my dad works with so
[00:20.520 --> 00:22.520]  It's a good trade fair trade
[00:25.300 --> 00:31.220]  Nice I pushed us live because I just I love I kind of really enjoy the back conversation that we have
[00:32.260 --> 00:34.700]  like secretly push the live
[00:40.060 --> 00:41.820]  But it was um
[00:41.820 --> 00:48.740]  Tomatillos are interesting. I actually have a purple variety that I'm really excited to explore and grow this year and see how it does
[00:48.740 --> 00:54.260]  It's it'll be fun tomatillos are kind of interesting
[00:54.260 --> 01:01.060]  They're like the ground cherries to like if you've had a ground cherry before which is kind of the similar plant, but not really
[01:02.700 --> 01:04.540]  They're interesting
[01:04.540 --> 01:09.500]  But I've never been a very they take up way too much room and on a field but tomatillos
[01:09.500 --> 01:14.380]  I fucking loved myself could sell severity and if I can make it like purple, that would be epic
[01:15.140 --> 01:16.420]  Dude
[01:16.420 --> 01:22.740]  if the ladies would go wild if you brought them some purple tomatillos like the Mexican ladies do they would
[01:23.300 --> 01:25.300]  They would eat it up. I
[01:26.060 --> 01:32.180]  Mean I would too if I saw some purple sauce in front of me. I'm good. Oh, yeah. Give me that. What's that? You know?
[01:34.700 --> 01:37.940]  Purple is my favorite color too. So it's just kind of anything purple
[01:38.780 --> 01:39.820]  So
[01:39.820 --> 01:46.900]  We should do the whole startup. Hi everybody as people roll in this is another week of planting seeds
[01:47.260 --> 01:49.180]  with mr. Trees
[01:49.180 --> 01:54.780]  We are excitedly along. I think everybody's what six weeks from seed plant
[01:55.700 --> 01:57.700]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, Ron. I'm
[01:59.700 --> 02:01.700]  Probably more like four and a half
[02:01.940 --> 02:05.220]  Yeah, I'm probably closer to you. I would I started a little bit later
[02:05.940 --> 02:08.460]  So I actually I did bring up
[02:09.980 --> 02:12.860]  This and I was gonna pull down a couple my five
[02:14.420 --> 02:18.340]  As you got some beautiful plants here, mr. Trees
[02:19.140 --> 02:21.140]  That you have sent along these little
[02:21.820 --> 02:27.100]  Little seeds man. They're they're quite gorgeous and very nice on the structure and thick
[02:28.500 --> 02:30.500]  Leaf profiles
[02:31.460 --> 02:33.460]  It's really really really really nice
[02:37.140 --> 02:39.580]  Yeah, I just put some of the ice cream cake
[02:40.220 --> 02:41.820]  Can the hearse in the flower?
[02:41.820 --> 02:48.140]  So I just said the hell with it and I threw through some into flower just kind of hurry them along
[02:48.740 --> 02:52.300]  So I'm excited. Those are the ones you're going right? Is that what you got?
[02:52.820 --> 02:56.220]  Yeah, these are the ice cream cakes and I was gonna talk them now
[02:56.780 --> 02:59.780]  Yeah, which it looks like that. It looks like them
[03:00.500 --> 03:02.900]  With that shorter rounder fatter leaf like that
[03:03.740 --> 03:10.120]  Like that heavy overlap on some of these where's this there's one that's like almost round on the leaf
[03:10.120 --> 03:12.340]  It's like this one. Yeah, here it is
[03:13.260 --> 03:19.900]  I'll show you this one. This is beautiful. This is something like I you don't see that like oh short those are
[03:21.060 --> 03:23.060]  Love that. Yeah, those are killer
[03:24.500 --> 03:30.660]  Those always come with those delicate like in that beautiful hours to you know, and I mean those really kind of
[03:31.460 --> 03:34.380]  That's a that's an interesting I like that I like that overlay
[03:37.100 --> 03:41.540]  They're starting to have a nice aroma to them as well, which is pretty good I've been running like
[03:42.340 --> 03:48.580]  What's everybody running for their day and night temps you guys like if we could go around the room and kind of talk about what?
[03:48.580 --> 03:50.660]  Our climate is for this period of time
[03:50.660 --> 03:57.380]  Maybe that'd be a good point of conversation and I'll start it is I'm indoor outdoor greenhouse type of fucking deal
[03:57.380 --> 04:00.300]  So it's it's a little bit of a of a swing
[04:00.300 --> 04:05.940]  I probably I've been touching as low as 10 degrees Celsius over the last couple nights here in there
[04:06.700 --> 04:11.740]  and usually hit like around 27 on a on a
[04:12.460 --> 04:18.180]  Medium cloudy day and on a sunny day. I get up to 30. So there's some pretty heavy swings that are in there
[04:18.180 --> 04:20.180]  so that's what I'm thinking a lot of the
[04:20.340 --> 04:25.940]  You can't you can see some of the internode spacing especially like this guy right here is a little bit longer a little bit more
[04:26.060 --> 04:30.940]  Extended I'm pretty sure that's kind of why I'm seeing that that happens with a lot of my plants
[04:30.940 --> 04:34.100]  So this time here they all kind of they get this little leap in them
[04:34.540 --> 04:38.180]  But what's everybody else running? Do you want to maybe start their coastal grown? I?
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.880]  Usually try to keep everything at a constant 75
[04:45.720 --> 04:49.680]  during veg and and propagation stages
[04:50.200 --> 04:52.080]  it's just
[04:52.080 --> 04:57.200]  Really easy to just keep it right there and not let the fluctuations go especially because it's indoors
[04:58.160 --> 04:59.840]  but then in
[04:59.840 --> 05:04.160]  flowering especially during the winter time I take advantage of the cold and
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.160]  I'll let it fluctuate down into the high 30s low 40s
[05:10.240 --> 05:12.560]  And I'm talking Fahrenheit about this
[05:13.040 --> 05:13.760]  but yeah
[05:13.760 --> 05:21.040]  just to just to hit those like real real shock values on the plant and to try to drive the plant and distress to where
[05:21.040 --> 05:22.840]  it really really
[05:22.840 --> 05:26.160]  puts out those real nice anthocyanins and
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.720]  And
[05:27.720 --> 05:34.240]  And starts to try to put out more res especially with that dry cold air just like just really pulling at it
[05:34.240 --> 05:38.900]  So that's what I try to do is try to keep it consistent except in flowering
[05:48.440 --> 05:50.440]  What about you Cory?
[05:51.960 --> 05:53.360]  So
[05:53.360 --> 05:55.360]  I've got my veg in the basement
[05:56.080 --> 06:01.320]  I don't really have a lot of control over it. It's typically somewhere between
[06:02.320 --> 06:08.720]  75 and 78 during the day my boilers in the next room over so I you know
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.880]  I get a little little extra heat from there
[06:11.640 --> 06:13.640]  and then
[06:14.360 --> 06:17.600]  Typically, unfortunately my my my humidity is low
[06:19.640 --> 06:21.640]  Because the boil is in the next room but
[06:22.280 --> 06:27.360]  You know as far as as far as the veg is concerned, that's how I you know, that's how I'm at right now
[06:27.360 --> 06:30.720]  I'd like to get another tent to try to you know, keep it more dialed in but
[06:31.640 --> 06:36.480]  Yeah, that's that's kind of out of control riding down the hill with a bicycle and no brakes
[06:40.080 --> 06:45.560]  So you kind of use the advantage of the really dry furnace room and just pull that dry air in
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.000]  It kind of just does its own thing, you know, it's it's this time of year
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.640]  It's really really dry just simply for the fact that the heat's running constantly
[06:58.240 --> 07:02.080]  But you know, I'd like to get a little bit more control here
[07:02.760 --> 07:07.480]  Before next winter skins, you know comes around try to get a little more control of the humidity. I
[07:15.500 --> 07:18.100]  Think Nick's wouldn't Nick would be next
[07:20.320 --> 07:22.160]  Well, man
[07:22.160 --> 07:24.160]  to be honest, I would love to
[07:25.320 --> 07:31.320]  Keep it where I want it, you know 75 and veg high humidity. I can keep
[07:31.960 --> 07:33.600]  the humidity
[07:33.600 --> 07:35.600]  Yeah
[07:38.680 --> 07:42.360]  I'm gonna a little bit what I got going on
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.480]  So
[07:46.480 --> 07:53.720]  This is some stuff. I'm running through right now. I got some Casey Jones and some black dog by Humboldt Cico
[07:56.320 --> 08:02.720]  Did your phone go landscape, all right, can you turn it landscape for me it just opens up the screen a bit more
[08:03.960 --> 08:05.600]  Yeah
[08:05.600 --> 08:09.400]  Yeah, that's beautiful. Thank you. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I got
[08:11.320 --> 08:18.280]  Stickered the door out cuz I got bored and I'm dude. I just really love stickers. I got my sticker right there and
[08:18.880 --> 08:21.080]  We're straight out of composting man
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.960]  Anyway some stuff I'm messing with dude, I've been neglecting everything so don't judge guys
[08:30.200 --> 08:34.480]  I've been so busy with the commercial stuff and this is just some side
[08:36.360 --> 08:39.440]  That I got and I got some stuff with my dad
[08:40.160 --> 08:46.720]  man, it just gets crazy, but so anyway what I was getting at is I can shut this door and
[08:47.280 --> 08:52.460]  With the AC on in here and this door shut and both of these lights running
[08:52.460 --> 08:59.320]  I can keep the humidity up, but I'm probably spiking about like 85 man with probably like 70 70 percent humidity
[08:59.960 --> 09:02.920]  And then in here I can keep it about 75
[09:03.880 --> 09:06.840]  70% humidity if it gets too high and flower
[09:06.840 --> 09:12.000]  I just throw a D D home right over there over here and and rock it out, man
[09:15.750 --> 09:22.810]  They said they're pretty happy looking plants man. I mean like I'm notorious for keeping plants in small pots for two
[09:22.810 --> 09:24.810]  And
[09:31.290 --> 09:33.290]  I have to find the right ones, too
[09:40.580 --> 09:44.580]  Nice that was awesome. So what do you what do you ideally run? Mr.
[09:48.820 --> 09:52.300]  Appreciate y'all sharing do what I'm lucky
[09:53.300 --> 09:57.660]  You know I got Southern California weather so I can run open room
[09:57.660 --> 10:01.580]  You know concepts where I use just the ambient temperature from outside
[10:02.220 --> 10:07.540]  You know with some fans and some different things I can kind of I can kind of jump around pretty good
[10:07.540 --> 10:13.140]  I've run so yeah, I was actually going to do a little transplanting while I was
[10:14.420 --> 10:21.780]  With you guys today and kind of just show you which one like I told you I had some some blacks and some greens
[10:21.780 --> 10:24.820]  I really don't think I have the Reds and I was gonna
[10:25.500 --> 10:29.100]  You know just show you like why I think I have the black and green
[10:29.540 --> 10:33.620]  Variations and then show you which ones the where the Pam is actually
[10:37.670 --> 10:45.110]  Well, yeah, oh no you went and mute there Nick you gotta unmute yourself, I think it's um you're some dead. Oh, sorry sorry
[10:46.190 --> 10:51.310]  So yeah, I'm gonna just show you guys which ones the Pam's have kind of like you know been
[10:54.670 --> 10:56.750]  Her dominant with
[10:57.190 --> 11:00.830]  this or black leaning and then
[11:01.350 --> 11:06.830]  Cuz I don't I think I may have one variation of the red in there, but you know you never know till you flower
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.040]  Exactly so mr.. Trees. Did you want to go go back on it?
[11:18.160 --> 11:20.160]  Yeah, no so
[11:20.320 --> 11:26.720]  I'm lucky with temperatures and stuff so I run LEDs so I have to run things a little hotter in general
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.120]  So I'm on my temperatures are usually in the 80s. I'm like 82
[11:30.600 --> 11:36.440]  You know eight somewhere between 79 and 85 during the day somewhere in that realm
[11:38.080 --> 11:43.960]  It night temperatures can drop down to 60 65 70 degrees something like that
[11:45.560 --> 11:48.160]  You know with the with the drop of climate and stuff like that
[11:48.160 --> 11:51.880]  It's the the humidity stays good the way I design my rooms and stuff like that
[11:51.880 --> 11:53.600]  I can kind of take advantage of
[11:53.600 --> 11:59.400]  You know the outside air and push things through nice and clean, and I don't usually have too much of an issue
[11:59.400 --> 12:05.400]  I always had more issues with heat and running running different types of electronics and things to cool the room and
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.660]  You know humidify the room and all that stuff before I switch to my LED setup and after I got LEDs my biggest problem
[12:11.660 --> 12:14.960]  Is in the winter time is trying to get more heat inside the room
[12:14.960 --> 12:19.120]  You know because they don't put out as much heat as the the old-fashioned stuff, so
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.000]  I'm usually somewhere between 80 80 and 85 and
[12:26.200 --> 12:27.680]  60
[12:27.680 --> 12:30.920]  65 and 72 somewhere in there at night, so
[12:31.800 --> 12:38.360]  Pretty cool humidity is usually pretty you know it's always above always above 60% so that's always good
[12:38.360 --> 12:40.440]  You know I can be somewhere, but I can be as low as as
[12:41.080 --> 12:45.360]  55 you know you know in some of the some of the summer days
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.280]  I could be as high as 90% in some some capacity
[12:50.280 --> 12:55.620]  You know some foggy foggy weeks and stuff like that, but just depends kind of how much
[12:55.620 --> 12:57.760]  I'm pushing how many plants are in there how big they are
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.300]  How much they're breathing you know stuff like that, but I got I got temperature control
[13:03.300 --> 13:07.800]  You know exhaust fans and things like that all over the place as soon as certain certain things hit
[13:08.080 --> 13:11.440]  Certain temperatures and parameters fans kick on things move off
[13:12.280 --> 13:14.680]  Moves the air evacuate stuff out so
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.860]  But I run a little hotter. You know in the 80s most of the time which is pretty cool
[13:20.920 --> 13:23.340]  So like that would be like late 20s
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.960]  So and so you're probably pushing in like 75 humidity
[13:33.320 --> 13:38.340]  You know but like I said as soon as soon as it hits certain temperatures depending on the time of year
[13:38.860 --> 13:44.660]  The air pretty pretty frequently you know what I mean with outside air so everything comes in and I get clean fresh air
[13:44.940 --> 13:46.220]  You know
[13:46.220 --> 13:48.220]  multiple times a day
[13:48.780 --> 13:53.120]  Which is pretty nice, so I don't have to like control the actual room
[13:53.120 --> 13:55.420]  I just got to keep the room from getting too fucked up
[13:55.420 --> 13:58.860]  You know what I mean, and I can I can refresh you with outside. You know what I mean
[13:58.860 --> 14:05.860]  It's it's pretty it's it's awesome because I go home back home to Arizona or we go to New York back to New York
[14:06.140 --> 14:09.300]  It's like man, there's a whole nother ballgame we got to turn on different things
[14:09.300 --> 14:12.900]  We got a you know we really got to take take a little extra. You know
[14:14.100 --> 14:19.660]  Extra precautions, and you know spend a little extra money, but here I can get away with it. Which is really nice
[14:19.660 --> 14:21.300]  It's one of the
[14:21.300 --> 14:26.140]  One of the godsands for having a good climate to live in you know never too hot never too cold
[14:26.780 --> 14:33.260]  Yeah, I mean, I'm jealous of you Americans being able to move to move to anywhere on that sunshine belt, man
[14:33.260 --> 14:36.540]  It's like it's cold here up in Canada
[14:43.940 --> 14:45.140]  Good
[14:45.140 --> 14:51.260]  But yeah, that's that and like I said, I just pushed some some of those ice cream cake Canada hearts into flour
[14:52.020 --> 14:55.100]  So you know maybe next week or so we'll pull one out
[14:55.100 --> 14:58.940]  Well, we'll take a look at a couple of those and see see how they're developing
[14:58.940 --> 15:05.340]  They had a nice little cakey smell those rounder leaves kind of like you have going on there a little bit tighter tighter
[15:05.340 --> 15:11.060]  No, it's really tight. You know really stout for most for the most part the males were all already
[15:11.060 --> 15:14.260]  You know those were the ones that jumped up. You know I mean like as per usual
[15:15.460 --> 15:21.820]  But yeah, that's that's kind of where I'm at with those and getting prepped and ready for the outdoor year
[15:22.700 --> 15:27.420]  Here and getting all the vegetable beds ready. I got all these which reminds me
[15:28.940 --> 15:30.940]  cheap little thing
[15:30.940 --> 15:32.940]  How many of you guys do this?
[15:34.820 --> 15:36.820]  But
[15:37.020 --> 15:39.620]  Old milk jugs old water bottles
[15:40.140 --> 15:44.660]  Old shit like this. I'm constantly you know over over the month period
[15:44.660 --> 15:49.460]  I have like little benches, and they're all full of these little jugs stacked stack butt to butt
[15:49.460 --> 15:50.220]  You know what I mean?
[15:50.220 --> 15:54.980]  They'll just be stacked up butt to butt all the way over they got a little label with their duct tape on there
[15:55.060 --> 16:00.180]  And it's like bell peppers the sweet pointy bell peppers you know the popping corn
[16:00.780 --> 16:03.300]  the you know here's here's some of the
[16:04.060 --> 16:08.660]  Here's some of the mulberry cuttings that are in the mulberry one here on this table here
[16:08.660 --> 16:10.860]  But I got hundreds of these little things
[16:10.860 --> 16:14.180]  And I don't know if anybody else can't sprout seed like this
[16:14.180 --> 16:19.500]  But some my outdoor stuff especially like when it's cold out, and I'm just coming out of winter
[16:19.500 --> 16:22.380]  We still got frosty days. You know ahead of us and stuff like that
[16:22.380 --> 16:25.500]  I'll crack open some milk jugs or some water bottles
[16:25.500 --> 16:30.020]  And I'll cut their heads almost off so I can fold them open fill them with a little bit of moist soil
[16:31.020 --> 16:34.060]  Plant my seeds right now. I'm gonna plant these little
[16:36.980 --> 16:41.460]  Sweet pointy bells you know there's some label inside the cup there sweet pointy bell
[16:42.300 --> 16:44.300]  These are orange and yellow
[16:44.540 --> 16:48.780]  Peppers they're they're like bell peppers except. They're pointy and long and they're delicious
[16:49.780 --> 16:55.220]  But yeah, I always do this and as soon as you get this get them planted you pull the top back on throw a piece
[16:55.220 --> 17:00.820]  Of duct tape around it or whatever tape around it throw this outside, and then as soon as there's no droplets
[17:01.380 --> 17:04.340]  On here after the first day or so there'll be a bunch of droplets
[17:04.340 --> 17:09.980]  It'll be like that you know a dome a friggin clone dome bunch of droplets will collect on the on the outside right there
[17:09.980 --> 17:11.140]  And when there's no more droplets
[17:11.140 --> 17:16.100]  That's when you know you need to water right and then as soon as they're you know soon as they're starting to poke out of
[17:16.100 --> 17:20.260]  The top or you got some good plant growth in there, and there's no more frosty nights
[17:20.700 --> 17:24.020]  Ahead of you you just crack this puppy back open peel open the tape
[17:24.140 --> 17:28.500]  And you can break off the little plants that are in here and just plant those or
[17:28.660 --> 17:32.060]  Plant this or whatever you want to do, but you can start all kinds of stuff
[17:32.060 --> 17:35.920]  Just using the old milk jugs or the old water bottles and the old duct tape method
[17:35.920 --> 17:40.480]  But I've got tons of old tables because they're perfect squares with those water bottles
[17:40.700 --> 17:44.400]  And I just got tons of tables. It's just like watermelons cucumbers
[17:44.760 --> 17:51.320]  You know cantaloupes, you know whatever so I've been I've been making a bunch of those lately and making sure I had a new breed your
[17:51.320 --> 17:52.640]  own peppers
[17:52.640 --> 17:56.240]  Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do corn corn is what I've been working on last couple years
[17:57.280 --> 17:59.080]  There was a period in time
[17:59.080 --> 18:03.040]  Several years back where I did a lot of different pepper projects and pepper breedings
[18:03.040 --> 18:04.720]  You know I used to work at a nursery
[18:04.720 --> 18:11.280]  And I got a question I ever people always keep for me is like how do you because peppers are all all?
[18:12.080 --> 18:14.080]  Self-propagating
[18:16.200 --> 18:18.200]  How the fuck do you cross
[18:19.600 --> 18:25.640]  Like it sounds like so one likely to happen how do you cross it if it's already right like right next to itself
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.560]  It's just like there's some sort of science involved like what do you do?
[18:30.880 --> 18:34.580]  Well like peppers and other things it's about I mean
[18:35.480 --> 18:37.160]  planting multiple
[18:37.160 --> 18:43.320]  Different types of peppers close together and letting them kind of co-mingle in that in that environment something
[18:43.320 --> 18:49.240]  That's like the easy way. You don't really you don't really know like like your exact success rates
[18:49.400 --> 18:51.400]  but in planning the offspring of
[18:51.800 --> 18:52.780]  situations like that
[18:52.780 --> 18:58.040]  You know where you plant two different kinds like a few of each kind plant really close together like in the same pot
[18:58.040 --> 19:00.040]  Other things like that there
[19:00.480 --> 19:02.480]  You're getting breeding
[19:03.240 --> 19:05.240]  So if you just want to do it like on a fun
[19:05.240 --> 19:12.760]  Like you know scale like mixing things that way and not really worrying about it is an easy way to do it
[19:13.080 --> 19:17.760]  Just plant the seeds of everything that you like the ones that you that you really enjoy eating
[19:18.280 --> 19:23.360]  planting those those ones and making sure that you're kind of doing that that type of selection, but like
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  corn and you know or
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.720]  Citrus or any of those other things you got to do a little bit. You know more
[19:32.680 --> 19:38.320]  Collected and tossing pollen on things and isolating stuff and being a little bit more
[19:38.560 --> 19:43.080]  you know hands-on breeding breeding wise you know what I mean, but usually with the peppers and
[19:44.560 --> 19:45.920]  Like the
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.240]  Zucchinis and all those other things you know you plant things close together
[19:49.240 --> 19:52.840]  And you're planting the offspring of those and you do that for a couple generations
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.760]  You know what I mean of getting those offspring out, and you've you've come out with something
[19:58.280 --> 20:03.080]  That you can kind of take the seeds from and that you've kind of mutated in some some form or fashion
[20:03.080 --> 20:06.160]  You know what I mean, which is kind of cool, but I just keep a lot of the seeds around
[20:06.920 --> 20:08.600]  Just so that I can grow food
[20:08.600 --> 20:12.520]  You know what I mean and all the all the best food that I eat you know throughout the year
[20:12.520 --> 20:18.120]  I save the seeds from that and I continue on and then like the popping corn is something that I was like a
[20:18.680 --> 20:22.200]  That's a project that I've been making you know the last several years
[20:22.760 --> 20:24.760]  Just making a multicolored
[20:25.040 --> 20:30.000]  Popping corn you know there's reds and purples and there's white and
[20:30.480 --> 20:37.040]  There's the gold and then there's like these kind of mixed colors of all those you know you can almost get some pinks in there
[20:37.040 --> 20:40.740]  And some other kind of like you know mcgreen you can get green to come out in there
[20:40.740 --> 20:44.440]  Which is kind of cool so over the last few years. I've been working on a mixed kernel
[20:44.960 --> 20:49.280]  Popping corn so you pull out that you got you got a colorful bag of popping corn
[20:49.280 --> 20:53.600]  You know and you have some that you isolate down to single colors red
[20:54.160 --> 21:00.080]  You know purple and white and whatever so that you can kind of you know have the individuality
[21:00.600 --> 21:05.880]  But I'd love to have you know just a cool cob of multicolored popping corn that just went in the bag
[21:05.880 --> 21:10.040]  I think that's cool. You know some rainbow corn my kids like it everybody you
[21:10.040 --> 21:12.640]  I don't know if anybody's ever grown their own popping corn and like
[21:13.040 --> 21:18.600]  it's like it's the same thing as regular corn a little smaller smaller kernels, or I mean smaller cobs and
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  You know you just you let them dry on the vine instead of harvest them early
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.500]  And then you shuck them when they're really dry and you put them in a pot with some friggin
[21:28.720 --> 21:34.000]  Oil and cover it up and pop that pop that shit and then put some fucking butter on it, man
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  It's the best shit in the world you know I mean so
[21:36.560 --> 21:41.720]  Once you pop your own corn you never go back, so I've been I've been doing that with some Maryland popping corn
[21:42.520 --> 21:43.880]  directionally, but
[21:43.880 --> 21:48.360]  Yeah, man every year. We do something. You know guys got to get planted. You know
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.600]  I'm
[21:53.680 --> 21:55.680]  Had this obsession
[22:00.960 --> 22:02.480]  Popcorn
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.800]  Popping corn like what you get on the shelf like your regular everyday
[22:07.320 --> 22:10.520]  Popping corn the only reason why that specific
[22:11.200 --> 22:15.520]  Variety is on the shelf is because of the yield the amount of
[22:15.920 --> 22:22.600]  Pop per piece and the quality that they get per square foot it has nothing to do with the actual quality
[22:23.240 --> 22:24.640]  taste
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.920]  Like it's only to do with the yield. That's it. It's got nothing to do with it being enjoyable at all
[22:29.920 --> 22:35.160]  Which is just mind-bendingly up in my mind to think about because it's a food
[22:35.160 --> 22:38.800]  Yeah, you consume right so I thought it'd be so like ten years ago
[22:38.800 --> 22:41.960]  I was like it'd be so cool to do like a multi color popping because they all
[22:42.400 --> 22:47.560]  The different colors can actually influence different shape of the pop to you get longer yes
[22:48.640 --> 22:50.640]  It's
[22:53.120 --> 22:55.120]  There's a specific type of like
[22:55.600 --> 23:02.040]  Like caramel corn the the stuff you make caramel corn out of that you would eat would put caramel on it is a denser
[23:02.040 --> 23:06.680]  Current popped once it's popped out. It's a denser kernel that comes out of there
[23:06.680 --> 23:10.360]  That's just harder rounder and then just more of a meaty
[23:10.960 --> 23:16.840]  Beautiful you know type kernel, and then there's things like the baby white kernels where they just barely a pop
[23:16.840 --> 23:19.740]  And it's just like this busted open little white thing
[23:19.740 --> 23:21.200]  You know I mean it doesn't have any shape
[23:21.200 --> 23:27.040]  And it's very light and airy and has its other type of you know flavors and complexities that it that it acts
[23:27.040 --> 23:29.840]  It just like cannabis. You know what I mean you're gonna have some dense buds
[23:29.840 --> 23:33.280]  You're gonna have some open bud structure. You're gonna have some smaller buds
[23:33.280 --> 23:38.040]  You're gonna have some giant buds cool cool thing and the variability in those different types of kernels
[23:38.040 --> 23:44.440]  Especially when they're popped out there. They're they're used for different purposes. You know just like that caramel corn is the good example
[23:44.440 --> 23:47.040]  It's a specific one that pops this way
[23:47.400 --> 23:52.280]  That is great for caramel corn and holds the holds the processing and all that stuff
[23:52.280 --> 23:55.340]  It doesn't break down and all that other stuff. You know which is kind of neat so
[23:55.880 --> 23:57.880]  Yeah, that plants plants rule. I
[23:58.800 --> 24:00.960]  Got a question for you, mr.. Trees
[24:01.960 --> 24:03.960]  so
[24:04.480 --> 24:07.760]  So you know I like to switch between
[24:08.520 --> 24:10.520]  you know like me I use a
[24:11.200 --> 24:14.640]  Neem and Karanja you know for my outdoor
[24:16.200 --> 24:19.560]  IPM and do you use like em5 or
[24:20.760 --> 24:23.400]  Just sulfur anything like that like
[24:24.160 --> 24:26.400]  Just wondering what kind of regimens you use
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.160]  Yeah, I don't I stop I don't use any any neem oils or anything outside
[24:32.160 --> 24:37.000]  I don't usually use anything like that. I use less oils outside because
[24:37.920 --> 24:42.320]  Once I'm above 85 degrees or 80 degrees. It's just it's just more dangerous
[24:43.960 --> 24:49.480]  You know it's just it's just something that I don't like to like to do as much so while they're young
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.080]  You know I'll use things like sulfur like I like sulfur. I like soap
[24:54.280 --> 24:59.800]  There's like you know potassium salt fatty acids, you know like you know for products that have it in it
[24:59.800 --> 25:02.200]  There's various other things you can make it
[25:02.960 --> 25:07.200]  Just it's like a soap. You know it did hydrates things, but I like the sulfur
[25:07.840 --> 25:11.040]  Like a liquid sulfur or something while they're all young growing them up
[25:11.840 --> 25:13.920]  Because it does everything you know what I mean
[25:15.800 --> 25:18.080]  It takes care of it takes care of business
[25:18.840 --> 25:24.960]  Sulfurs a safe element it's used by it can be used by the plant a lot of different ways. It's like I use
[25:26.120 --> 25:28.120]  for the most part and then
[25:28.600 --> 25:34.280]  Every once and again if I don't have any sulfur or I'm out of something I use the I'll use this
[25:34.880 --> 25:40.720]  It's like an organist. It's called organoside or something like that, and it's just it's like a sesame oil
[25:41.360 --> 25:43.360]  fish oil mixture
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.680]  And it's yeah, the oil or you know mineral oil
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.440]  You know any type of oil? Yeah, that's just used as a suffocant, and you know
[25:53.480 --> 25:57.920]  So sometimes I'll use that but if you're using sulfur you don't want to use oils together
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.520]  So usually right right usually I'm using sulfur you know
[26:02.800 --> 26:07.360]  Spraying all the time. I'm pretty I'm pretty proactive like while they're young and
[26:07.800 --> 26:13.000]  While they're getting going and as soon as I get close to entering flower. I mean before I enter flowers
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.400]  You know they get they get one last spray
[26:16.400 --> 26:19.200]  You know a week or two before they're gonna go go into flower
[26:19.200 --> 26:24.440]  And then I take my cuttings to go inside for the winter and then they flatten and they go into flower
[26:24.440 --> 26:27.120]  And then I don't never spray them again
[26:27.120 --> 26:31.880]  Then the mosquito nets go up in on the on the person if you don't if you don't have a hoop
[26:32.080 --> 26:34.080]  Or they're not in the greenhouse
[26:34.200 --> 26:36.440]  And you got them out in the open open air
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.000]  Then bud worms are gonna be your problem. That's my biggest best my biggest nemesis to hell
[26:43.160 --> 26:48.880]  Yeah, I hate spraying stuff on the flowers like I just I don't like using me too even though that's I won't do it
[26:48.880 --> 26:50.880]  You can use is BT
[26:51.160 --> 26:55.440]  Spin a sad yeah, I rather just pick them out nothing else you can do it you pick them out
[26:55.440 --> 26:58.960]  You're still gonna get friggin bud rot. You're still gonna be throwing buds away at the end
[26:58.960 --> 27:00.960]  I mean if you're picking out worms you've already lost
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.920]  Yeah, I lost that battle for the most part so
[27:05.440 --> 27:12.060]  There's these things called dyna dyna tap or dyna lights, and I got one yeah electric bug lights you hang them out all year
[27:13.060 --> 27:14.540]  Down and
[27:14.540 --> 27:17.540]  Then and then as soon as they go into flower I put up hoops
[27:17.540 --> 27:19.020]  I get PVC hoops
[27:19.020 --> 27:25.700]  And I put hoops yo and then I and I cover the most important ones with the mosquito netting and the mosquito netting lets everything
[27:25.700 --> 27:27.700]  Breathe keeps light through
[27:27.740 --> 27:32.480]  Protects them gives them a little and gives them everything that they need as long as I keeping them up high on hoops
[27:32.480 --> 27:36.540]  It's like the best thing in the world and I can keep those up all the way through flower till they finish
[27:36.540 --> 27:41.700]  And I never have to spray a goddamn thing on the flowers, and I get the fire to come out which is killer
[27:42.380 --> 27:44.380]  It's kind of a pain
[27:46.380 --> 27:48.380]  Make sure you go do you get it from
[27:50.500 --> 27:56.260]  Fabric stores like there's different fabric stores like Joanne fabrics and like Walmart order it for you
[27:58.340 --> 28:03.620]  Amazon's probably the best way you know unless you're you know against the you know the Amazon
[28:09.460 --> 28:11.460]  Yeah
[28:12.060 --> 28:14.060]  I
[28:15.140 --> 28:21.660]  Gold man, so how and you only need to you only need to net them for a for the period when they're getting in there
[28:27.620 --> 28:30.500]  It's crucial dude like I'm telling you right now like
[28:33.140 --> 28:35.420]  If you grow a real plant it's
[28:36.020 --> 28:40.340]  3-8 10 foot tall like a fucking tree you growing real fucking plants
[28:40.340 --> 28:42.780]  You know what I mean out there even little plants is it's pretty cool
[28:42.780 --> 28:45.220]  You can run a little mini hoop with the little I mean I do that
[28:45.580 --> 28:49.540]  But if you're going a big-ass plant that big-ass plant is gonna attract those
[28:49.540 --> 28:51.820]  I mean you're you're gonna be you're gonna throw away half of it
[28:51.820 --> 28:56.820]  You know what I mean out and just out in the open doing nothing unless you're spraying it and like really
[28:56.980 --> 28:58.860]  You know you're gonna throw away half of it
[28:58.860 --> 29:02.820]  You're gonna get blood rots and attacked by the worms, and you're gonna have all those issues
[29:02.820 --> 29:04.820]  So if you just grow it up
[29:05.620 --> 29:08.540]  You know how big it's gonna be when it goes into flower for the most part
[29:08.540 --> 29:14.580]  You just throw that hoop up right over the top man leave enough room for the stretch and and then a little bit
[29:14.660 --> 29:17.540]  It's like you you you're unbeatable
[29:17.540 --> 29:20.660]  I mean you really are in my climate if you're here in a rainy climate
[29:20.660 --> 29:25.300]  Then you're you're sucking because that that netting will get all clogged up with water
[29:25.780 --> 29:29.220]  Get all friggin ratty and shit like that, and that's just that sucks ass
[29:29.220 --> 29:31.700]  You know what I mean, but if you're in a drier climate
[29:31.980 --> 29:35.660]  It's not gonna get any rain until the end you only have to worry about that at the end
[29:35.660 --> 29:38.460]  You know I mean you can pull them down on those rainy nights
[29:38.460 --> 29:40.820]  You can you can adjust which is pretty cool
[29:43.180 --> 29:47.060]  Keep them covered and then you're you're solid but ever since I started covering
[29:47.860 --> 29:48.980]  like
[29:48.980 --> 29:54.260]  It's just the bins are full of fire. You know what I mean instead of like worrying about
[29:54.260 --> 29:56.420]  Oh is this one rotten and you have to like
[29:56.420 --> 29:58.420]  I
[30:03.060 --> 30:09.900]  Mean I never have a problem with mites or anything because you know I I spray the name, but yeah once it flowers man
[30:09.900 --> 30:10.580]  I don't do anything
[30:10.580 --> 30:15.580]  And I just end up picking them out like you said you end up losing a couple ounces out of every plant
[30:15.580 --> 30:21.980]  And it's just you know it's frustrating. You know especially on the commercial side of it, and and you know I
[30:22.260 --> 30:27.380]  Honestly don't smoke indoor weed guys like I I grow it I grow it all the same
[30:27.500 --> 30:35.380]  I just I don't feel healthy when I smoke it if that makes sense like I feel like nothing can raise the metal
[30:35.820 --> 30:43.340]  That outside like I can grow the inside stuff, but it just man. It doesn't they're not resinous buds
[30:43.700 --> 30:49.980]  It's like soft weed when you put it in a joint it like you can it feels like and get like two or three grams
[30:49.980 --> 30:55.580]  In there you know you can't it. Just don't even smoke the same. They don't roll the same
[30:55.900 --> 31:01.580]  It's not the same, and I don't feel healthy when I smoke it, so I just smoke outdoor weed, but I
[31:02.220 --> 31:04.620]  do love to grow the indoor weed because
[31:04.980 --> 31:11.740]  You know things that aren't working outside in your environment you can take indoors and grow them and and that's how some of the phenomenal
[31:12.300 --> 31:15.760]  Terpenes that we have today have come about so I mean
[31:16.120 --> 31:20.040]  I'm really stoked about this Pam one cross guys like
[31:21.080 --> 31:26.240]  Dude, I wish you could smell this mail that I have it's but it's just it's
[31:28.080 --> 31:30.080]  It's like man
[31:30.200 --> 31:33.360]  It reminds me some old-school some old-school weed
[31:33.360 --> 31:39.900]  I I don't know just like I had some lambs bread back in the day, and that's really close smelling to that
[31:40.720 --> 31:43.040]  Like it's it smells good, man
[31:45.760 --> 31:50.280]  In bed, there's no I like I like picking this the veg thinkers
[31:50.960 --> 31:53.660]  They really it's nice. It's nice to have them a little bit
[31:54.480 --> 31:57.700]  You know gives you something to look forward to you know to you smell one
[31:57.700 --> 32:02.060]  You're like you smell a couple you're like. I there's nothing really here. It smells like a plant smells like oh
[32:02.160 --> 32:07.960]  That smells pretty fucking good. It's got something it gives you a little little pep in your step. I love I love that
[32:07.960 --> 32:09.960]  I love a little tickle
[32:11.400 --> 32:13.400]  So that's cool
[32:14.400 --> 32:16.400]  Go over it coastal
[32:16.640 --> 32:20.560]  Yes, I want to do a little one man. You just rub that one I
[32:22.240 --> 32:24.720]  Wanted to agree with Nick on the
[32:25.520 --> 32:32.280]  Difference with the organics versus the salt and I use the man-made salts along with organics
[32:32.280 --> 32:35.360]  I try to just drive the system using both
[32:36.200 --> 32:40.000]  To take advantage and double dip, but I completely agree
[32:40.760 --> 32:46.200]  Especially with like food you can like it tastes metallic you get this like salt buildup taste and
[32:46.880 --> 32:50.080]  especially with like commercial agriculture you get this like
[32:50.520 --> 32:52.520]  It just builds up into the food
[32:52.520 --> 32:59.580]  and if they don't flush it which they typically don't you you can definitely tell the difference between organic versus non-organic and then
[32:59.640 --> 33:01.640]  With the way it burns absolutely
[33:02.720 --> 33:04.720]  100% it's it's
[33:04.920 --> 33:09.560]  It's just night and day I don't even like the way it makes me feel
[33:22.630 --> 33:27.710]  Like I'm so West Coast and like every time you pop in I'm like, oh there's Cory again
[33:27.710 --> 33:29.710]  I just appreciate that
[33:31.590 --> 33:34.270]  No, but I don't I don't like the way it makes me feel I I
[33:34.270 --> 33:37.950]  Think it makes me feel like edgy ringy. I don't know
[33:37.950 --> 33:44.430]  it's almost like the feeling that I used to get that made me not smoke weed for a long time and
[33:45.230 --> 33:48.390]  I'm almost wondering if it's because of you know
[33:49.270 --> 33:50.950]  pesticides or
[33:50.950 --> 33:57.150]  Just the synthetic growing or God only knows but you know had gotten into it back then that put me off for so long
[33:57.150 --> 33:59.150]  you know
[34:00.270 --> 34:06.610]  So I gotta ask you
[34:07.450 --> 34:09.450]  So I gotta ask
[34:09.610 --> 34:11.610]  Mr. Trees I
[34:11.610 --> 34:17.810]  Got some plants here. I'm gonna taught them what node should I taught them that I think?
[34:17.810 --> 34:21.650]  We're gonna leave it up to the breeder or or to the group to decide
[34:23.210 --> 34:27.850]  Is as I said, I always just take this the very very
[34:28.250 --> 34:35.390]  Not even even though I keep those and I'll go even just this just to come out just a little the brand new tip
[34:35.630 --> 34:41.710]  I'll reach into the brand new tip and I'll just I'll layer just literally just pull it up and it pops right off just like
[34:41.710 --> 34:45.150]  a little little pop that's it. That's all I ever do and
[34:45.790 --> 34:50.550]  Then and then and then they'll grow out and I'll either take if I unless I'm taking a clone
[34:50.550 --> 34:51.070]  You know what?
[34:51.070 --> 34:51.310]  I mean
[34:51.310 --> 34:56.870]  so either you're taking the top clone or you're or you're or you're topping them that way and I like to kind of grow them up
[34:56.870 --> 34:59.670]  a little bit and then just take that first that
[35:00.470 --> 35:05.690]  That brand new set of leaves just just those little tiny ones right out and then that's it man
[35:08.030 --> 35:14.550]  Fucking clone them in there when they branch out and then throw that bottom half into flour, you know
[35:16.550 --> 35:17.950]  I
[35:17.950 --> 35:21.030]  Love munching my little tip tops when I get to do it
[35:22.830 --> 35:28.270]  You know, you can actually root you can actually root that little teeny tip top that little fuck off
[35:28.990 --> 35:31.310]  Little fucking thing you can root that dude
[35:32.190 --> 35:37.710]  You can put that right into a little into a little block or a little piece of soil and you know
[35:37.710 --> 35:42.450]  Dome it, you know and I've I've seen I've seen them
[35:42.470 --> 35:44.670]  You know what? I mean be rooted which is like
[35:47.670 --> 35:51.110]  I mean, it's not it's not it's not as easy as other stuff
[35:51.110 --> 35:56.790]  But it actually is blew me away when when I was told that and and then saw it I was like, yeah
[35:57.590 --> 35:59.590]  I gotta try it now
[36:02.670 --> 36:06.830]  So you find there's anything to like for these for these
[36:08.070 --> 36:13.270]  Crosses you find there's anything that we should be cautious of or be weary powdery mildew
[36:16.670 --> 36:22.710]  So only only just like the cake is is the only thing that I would worry about like inner
[36:23.030 --> 36:27.790]  Intersex traits like popping out, you know, I mean more frequently, you know, cuz the ice cream cake
[36:27.790 --> 36:33.030]  I mean I keep this that thing off or run it in a weird room and it it herms out like nobody's business
[36:33.030 --> 36:40.310]  You know it is what it is, but it's a sparkly beauty with some killer earth and some stuff in there. It's it's undeniable. So
[36:41.510 --> 36:43.670]  That's the only one that I would say, you know
[36:44.390 --> 36:48.990]  I'd strip off the bottoms, you know what I mean? And and not worry, you know, not worry too much
[36:48.990 --> 36:52.190]  But I wouldn't just let it run raw without looking at it, you know
[36:52.710 --> 36:55.710]  the Pam ones and you know the
[36:56.630 --> 37:01.550]  You know, the OG's are less likely to I mean the OG but less likely to
[37:02.310 --> 37:04.310]  than that than that cake so
[37:04.590 --> 37:08.030]  But the Pam's bulletproof, but other than that no, I think that
[37:09.030 --> 37:14.750]  So far, they've all been really stout. I don't know if you guys are got more stoutness and yours or not
[37:14.750 --> 37:16.750]  but most of them even
[37:17.670 --> 37:18.630]  Um
[37:18.630 --> 37:21.190]  DOGs and stuff had a little bit more stoutness to them
[37:21.510 --> 37:25.710]  Especially the Royals had a lot of stoutness to them. The ice cream cakes had a lot of stoutness to them
[37:26.270 --> 37:29.830]  The Pam's had you know, I mean they battle it out a little bit
[37:29.830 --> 37:34.510]  They're still more stout closer noting, you know, but I haven't had any real rock star
[37:35.030 --> 37:38.230]  Tall lanky ones come through so that's not that's interesting
[37:39.910 --> 37:46.550]  On the on the Herm thing man, so, you know, I've been diving deep into research
[37:47.230 --> 37:49.230]  some people I mean
[37:49.390 --> 37:50.470]  You know
[37:50.470 --> 37:58.390]  Rotalization was a thing back in the day and that's how people collectively kept seed and ran feminized see through in fields
[37:59.910 --> 38:01.910]  Generations and
[38:02.590 --> 38:04.910]  They taught I mean dude and I've had it myself
[38:06.470 --> 38:12.030]  You know, they've had plants that have that have those intersex traits that throw
[38:13.030 --> 38:14.190]  Phenomenal
[38:14.190 --> 38:21.870]  Terpenes or numerics and a lot higher than any of the ones without sex traits and it's like some of those you wonder
[38:22.270 --> 38:29.390]  Do you keep them around? Do you breed back with those? Do you outcross after you stabilize?
[38:29.750 --> 38:36.990]  What you have, you know because you will potentially still see that in that but those are the outliers
[38:37.310 --> 38:39.310]  sometimes and it do
[38:42.030 --> 38:47.870]  All the chems the chem 91 the the OG's
[38:48.750 --> 38:50.350]  Yeah
[38:50.350 --> 38:53.350]  You know what? I mean? All those are gorilla glue
[38:56.710 --> 39:00.950]  Our chance friggin, you know something went off that shouldn't have the sour diesel
[39:01.670 --> 39:06.590]  You know what? I mean? Like yeah, they're all they're all that way, you know
[39:06.590 --> 39:10.790]  And it's funny though because I have seen some of those that are just like wow
[39:11.110 --> 39:16.030]  This is the most stellar fucking herb, but the plant fucking Herm's like, you know
[39:20.070 --> 39:26.030]  You know, they're not the ones that show up at the end and the nanners that are like, yeah sneaky sneaky ones
[39:26.030 --> 39:32.910]  You know, those are like the ones that just like day 17 day 22 somewhere in there. You're seeing that you're like, you know
[39:32.910 --> 39:34.910]  Yeah
[39:36.470 --> 39:39.630]  But that stuff I had I had a gorilla butter one time
[39:39.950 --> 39:45.590]  Then I was running through a bunch of seeds and man, dude, this gorilla butter was fucking fire, dude
[39:45.590 --> 39:50.350]  But I had to pull off all the lower branches on the thing. So it was just like the top Cola
[39:51.350 --> 39:53.350]  Without
[39:59.150 --> 40:03.510]  And I kept it around for like three runs just just for the smoke just to smoke it
[40:03.510 --> 40:04.110]  You know what? I mean?
[40:04.110 --> 40:08.950]  And I'd run a little bit and I'd strip it down to that that little thing and it's like man, it's not worth it
[40:08.950 --> 40:14.710]  It's like eventually I threw it in the trash. I couldn't breathe with it and it was it was a waste of time
[40:14.710 --> 40:17.150]  But the herb was fucking fire, dude
[40:17.630 --> 40:24.470]  Damn you felt get you feel guilty. You're like man smoking this herring thing right now. I feel really guilty because I
[40:26.110 --> 40:29.530]  Have a plan like what you're talking about right now
[40:30.230 --> 40:36.330]  Like dude, I even tried to reverse it. No pollen, but I got something to breed to it
[40:36.330 --> 40:39.230]  But I mean that's just feminized and I'm like, okay
[40:39.230 --> 40:45.350]  Well, maybe that I could get something out of but who knows it was just like a one-time deal
[40:45.670 --> 40:49.150]  Actually honestly guys a freebie seed, you know
[40:49.150 --> 40:53.990]  And that's what really got me into wanting to be a testing because you never know
[40:54.230 --> 41:01.270]  Like, you know that ice cream cake that you got could be just like phenomenal this Pam that I got
[41:01.270 --> 41:04.350]  It's just you never know and someone could just have this
[41:04.990 --> 41:12.190]  you know you get into those positions when you come up with some really good things and some really sticky things and
[41:12.750 --> 41:20.950]  Sometimes mistakes happen from the best things. It's just crazy, you know, like what kind of situations we put ourselves in and
[41:21.470 --> 41:24.790]  The outcome of it. Sometimes it's great. You know, I'm like
[41:25.390 --> 41:26.790]  Mr. Trees
[41:26.790 --> 41:30.350]  Got like a beef jerky aroma to it. I don't know why
[41:32.750 --> 41:34.350]  It smells like
[41:34.350 --> 41:36.350]  like no like
[41:36.350 --> 41:42.630]  A thing in the in the Kandahar is meat turps like like rotting meat
[41:43.710 --> 41:45.710]  Stuff like that. So like
[41:52.350 --> 41:54.830]  Coastal you look like you wanted to say something there, but
[41:56.030 --> 41:59.710]  oh, yeah on the intersect tendencies, I
[42:00.350 --> 42:04.270]  remember growing up when like in the 90s growing and
[42:04.430 --> 42:08.390]  Like people always talked about don't don't allow or a mafra did it
[42:08.390 --> 42:15.150]  I have a blah blah blah blah blah blah and it's so much bullshit because all the best stuff was the chem 91
[42:15.710 --> 42:21.910]  And chem 91 was self in a bag seed to create OG good and then everyone else that has their ghost
[42:21.910 --> 42:26.870]  Oh gee, everything else is self. Oh gee push from the chem 91 or it and
[42:27.510 --> 42:32.270]  And then you know the chem D all that has huge intersect tendencies
[42:32.510 --> 42:35.030]  But there's I think a lot of the best plans are
[42:35.550 --> 42:41.070]  Usually her math or did it and I don't think it's an on-off great. I think it's a metabolic function
[42:41.790 --> 42:48.430]  Along with all the other metabolic functions that leaves the plant driving itself to try to recreate itself
[42:49.430 --> 42:51.430]  uh, and and I think there's just
[42:51.950 --> 42:59.070]  The genetics are the tendency the tendency the ability how much is willing to try to save its life
[42:59.070 --> 43:03.470]  When it doesn't get pollinated by an outside source or it thinks it's going to die
[43:04.230 --> 43:07.670]  And with males particularly when you're selecting males
[43:08.030 --> 43:11.990]  The best males are always the ones that have intersect tendencies
[43:12.550 --> 43:16.790]  And have tons of resin the ones that show the female flowers. I've found
[43:17.750 --> 43:22.910]  That you can basically be guaranteed. They're going to bang out the best seed stock
[43:22.910 --> 43:26.510]  You can get out of all your other meals out of all the other pollens
[43:26.510 --> 43:29.350]  And I even found that in sense II stuff and
[43:30.310 --> 43:35.470]  They really try to vet all their stuff. But I mean you'll find it everywhere. It's just part of the plant
[43:35.470 --> 43:40.030]  It's not an on-off thing. It's just a tendency to do that. And so I
[43:40.910 --> 43:46.030]  Just I just wanted to bring that up because I've been doing this forever and and I've noticed it
[43:46.630 --> 43:51.790]  In every single type of cannabis and you can force anything to go her math or did it through stress?
[43:51.790 --> 43:57.710]  It's it's something that triggers it and it doesn't matter what the trigger is if it's got that potential it's gonna happen
[43:58.790 --> 44:05.950]  It's it's basically the plants level like it's basically it's every plan is different
[44:08.190 --> 44:14.390]  Yeah, yeah, they get to a certain point and how stressed they get and so some more more stress tolerant than others
[44:14.390 --> 44:17.790]  So that's where people say they're breeding non hermaphroditic
[44:17.790 --> 44:21.230]  Yeah, yeah funny thing I did a funny thing back in the day where I
[44:22.350 --> 44:27.870]  I was trying to breed the hermaphroditic trait out of out of this out of this plant this
[44:28.550 --> 44:32.390]  Bag seed plant that you know, I always found a few seeds in there
[44:32.390 --> 44:36.070]  It always do through flowers at some point and it was just like paying the button
[44:36.070 --> 44:40.150]  I wanted to kind of plant it and I was like, okay, I'm gonna plant it and I'm gonna plant it
[44:40.150 --> 44:44.430]  I'm gonna plant it and I'm gonna plant it and I'm gonna plant it and I'm gonna plant it and I'm gonna plant it
[44:44.430 --> 44:47.270]  Through flowers at some point it was just like paying the button
[44:47.270 --> 44:50.390]  I wanted to kind of breed that out of there, but as soon as I like
[44:51.190 --> 44:54.030]  Got plants that didn't do that
[44:54.430 --> 45:00.270]  The herb wasn't as good like it that traveled with it like that trait traveled with
[45:00.630 --> 45:04.690]  Like this went with the fire earth, you know what I mean?
[45:04.690 --> 45:09.030]  Like there was as soon as I broke you break them apart and you go a different way like you lose the fire
[45:09.030 --> 45:10.110]  Herb, you know what I mean?
[45:10.550 --> 45:14.510]  It was a weird thing and like I always used to put them in one gallon pots and
[45:14.950 --> 45:20.670]  Flower them in one gallon pots to to stress them out, you know because they would have too big of a root ball
[45:20.670 --> 45:24.790]  They get hot they dry out quick, you know, I mean you have to be on top of it
[45:24.790 --> 45:27.670]  You know other stuff and it just I always found that the smaller
[45:27.990 --> 45:31.550]  Smaller the pot that I tried to force them to flower and I always would get more
[45:31.670 --> 45:34.670]  Plants would want to throw the throw the throw the herm. So
[45:35.670 --> 45:38.110]  Yeah, as soon as I stopped seeing
[45:38.910 --> 45:45.110]  That pop up all those plants never had never had that it factor, you know what I mean?
[45:45.110 --> 45:46.470]  And it was like man, it was crazy
[45:46.470 --> 45:52.550]  It was like I figured out like, you know, I figured that maybe it just it traveled with that and maybe it's just that particular
[45:52.750 --> 45:56.750]  you know variety or whatever and different ones can be unlocked and
[45:57.310 --> 45:58.950]  Chased out of there through numbers
[45:58.950 --> 46:02.390]  But it was one of those things that every time you saw it like without it
[46:02.510 --> 46:06.510]  The herb was like this and every time you saw it when I was like this and said fuck
[46:06.510 --> 46:09.070]  Can't you can't work with that? You know what I mean?
[46:09.070 --> 46:11.470]  She can't give those to people and can ruin lives
[46:11.470 --> 46:13.470]  So it's just that the project died
[46:13.710 --> 46:20.390]  But you know something that I really wanted to kind of do that. I kind of figured they traveled together in some weird way
[46:20.390 --> 46:24.550]  You know and then looking at all the other weird varieties that have the characteristic
[46:24.550 --> 46:26.950]  They're all you know, they're all fire fire, you know what I mean?
[46:26.950 --> 46:29.990]  You try to break them apart and everybody's been trying to break them apart to make you know
[46:29.990 --> 46:35.150]  It's like as soon you break them apart. It's you know, you don't you know have that same herb anymore, you know
[46:35.150 --> 46:37.150]  so it's hard that I
[46:37.910 --> 46:41.550]  Wish we could you know, I wish I could run through all the numbers and have the
[46:42.230 --> 46:43.470]  infinity
[46:43.470 --> 46:45.150]  space and
[46:45.150 --> 46:47.950]  Budget to figure it all out, you know, it would be cool
[46:48.990 --> 46:56.870]  Yeah, as soon as you pull that one metabolic process you pull away from another you're always just playing playing this game
[46:56.870 --> 47:03.390]  Of pull push, you know one way or another with with everything and it's always just chasing your tail a whole damn time
[47:03.990 --> 47:10.750]  With breeding, um, we'll never play God I think I think it's just you know, just do what you can with what you got
[47:14.780 --> 47:16.780]  Calculated betting
[47:17.620 --> 47:23.440]  Calculated betting, you know, it's like I know what's in the deck and I know it's good what could happen
[47:23.440 --> 47:25.440]  Let's just try and find what I want
[47:25.860 --> 47:29.680]  Hopefully I can lay a landing at the hand of cards that result in what I'm looking for
[47:30.360 --> 47:35.520]  But you just got to keep playing that game and play it play in another round playing another hand playing another
[47:37.680 --> 47:40.880]  Yeah, right like you got to see what comes out of it
[47:40.880 --> 47:45.040]  and I think that's half the fun of the collectors and why people love it love it is because it's like
[47:45.480 --> 47:48.760]  Now I got a 10 pack and I get to find my gold card, you know
[47:48.760 --> 47:54.940]  I get to buy my rookie card or you know, what have you and I think it's just it's it's a lot of fun
[47:54.940 --> 47:59.240]  And I'm like, there's there's a couple in here. I'm looking at I'm like you're gonna be fucking epic
[47:59.680 --> 48:01.880]  I can just see the shape in you
[48:01.880 --> 48:06.520]  I see how you're developing or a lot of the signs that I look for you got a good sturdy frame
[48:06.520 --> 48:09.900]  You know, you're not like super hollow on the on the stem
[48:09.900 --> 48:13.060]  But there's a little bit of all enough so the close look at the middle middle section of the plant
[48:13.060 --> 48:17.520]  It's okay at this period of time. They're growing and developing really well, which is nice
[48:17.520 --> 48:21.140]  So I'm hoping to have my first plants into flower
[48:22.240 --> 48:24.240]  Like in a month
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.240]  To to two months
[48:27.280 --> 48:29.280]  my goal
[48:30.200 --> 48:31.720]  Hell yeah
[48:31.720 --> 48:38.100]  I'm excited for those cakes man, because you know that that can the heart is gonna be you know
[48:38.100 --> 48:41.400]  It's it's it's got nasty in it in its blood. You know what I mean?
[48:41.400 --> 48:44.880]  It's got that rotten meat and that those earthy type tones in there
[48:45.680 --> 48:46.880]  and
[48:46.880 --> 48:48.880]  if it can kind of
[48:49.080 --> 48:53.960]  Keep some of that that modern-day sparkle, you know that cake sparkle that it's got
[48:53.960 --> 48:56.720]  You know what? I mean and like that that that
[48:57.440 --> 49:03.540]  Just just that bag of peel and and then keep some of that cakeyness with its you know
[49:03.600 --> 49:09.760]  Flavors that it has in there. I mean man, those are gonna be some some funky plants and they're definitely gonna have dense
[49:10.280 --> 49:15.600]  Dense type flowers that are gonna travel well because of the you know, the types of plants that we're working with
[49:15.600 --> 49:18.680]  You know what? I mean in general so it's gonna be it's gonna be a denser
[49:19.920 --> 49:25.820]  Nastier frosty, you know, so I'm excited. I'm excited for those those cakes to see how much
[49:26.720 --> 49:29.080]  How much sparkle we can get to hang in there? I
[49:33.720 --> 49:38.800]  Think I should bring up some of the photos and stuff from the Dagger Academy
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.160]  There to show everybody what we got in the in the whole thing in the jigger I
[50:00.080 --> 50:15.960]  Like those
[50:16.400 --> 50:20.920]  Hey, I noticed that there was some cool ranch on there for a half a minute and
[50:21.520 --> 50:24.200]  Then they disappeared somebody bought them up quick
[50:27.150 --> 50:29.150]  Yeah, I don't know
[50:29.950 --> 50:34.950]  Sometimes Peter pulls aside things when he gets them he pulls side one or two or something, you know
[50:35.470 --> 50:38.210]  Yeah, there's a problem or anything or whatever, you know
[50:38.990 --> 50:44.910]  Somebody's going after after enough people ask for it or you know, it goes it goes up there. I'm sure
[50:45.590 --> 50:49.910]  So I I wish that's one of those ones that I wish I would have made more of you know
[50:49.910 --> 50:56.350]  Cuz I had this I was doing this whole pine tar thing for like two seasons. I was looking at the pine tar
[50:57.110 --> 51:01.590]  in and out and backwards and I made a bunch of stuff and and
[51:02.150 --> 51:04.150]  went at it with it, so
[51:05.070 --> 51:07.590]  That cool ranch was the one that was the winner though
[51:07.590 --> 51:09.130]  Everybody always asked for that cool ranch
[51:09.130 --> 51:13.390]  So I wish I could go back and make a little bit more of those but anybody you got them make some
[51:14.710 --> 51:16.710]  make some more because
[51:17.670 --> 51:19.670]  People like those
[51:19.910 --> 51:21.710]  No, no, I
[51:21.710 --> 51:27.950]  Feel like you have to say it with an ace like who ranch like like, you know, like Brian from Family Guy says
[51:36.140 --> 51:38.140]  That's cool
[51:38.580 --> 51:40.840]  Yeah, I'm smoking this dog Walker
[51:41.660 --> 51:43.660]  cherry gasm fam
[51:43.700 --> 51:46.780]  That I did another thing. I probably should have
[51:47.900 --> 51:50.900]  Made more of because I just planted two seeds
[51:51.700 --> 51:53.980]  Just to kind of look at I didn't make very many of them
[51:53.980 --> 51:58.020]  I just planted two seeds just to look at them through them in the corner didn't take care of it and it turned out to
[51:58.020 --> 52:02.620]  Be just supreme friggin fire. I was like, oh my god, of course, of course it did
[52:03.540 --> 52:08.020]  So I think it's it is it time for a tour of coastal groans?
[52:08.580 --> 52:13.220]  Flower plants you want to give it you want to tell us what you got going on there, brother?
[52:14.620 --> 52:16.700]  Yeah, if I can't make the camera work
[52:17.460 --> 52:21.460]  Let me see here tell me when it comes into focus
[52:30.020 --> 52:32.020]  They got a little bit of stretch
[52:32.500 --> 52:36.100]  Because I switched them to an LED instead of a fluorescent
[52:36.820 --> 52:39.300]  Are you able to put white lights on them?
[52:40.180 --> 52:44.500]  Just so I see like the plant color is or is it like is it not possible?
[52:45.460 --> 52:47.460]  Can you get a light
[52:47.980 --> 52:53.100]  I don't think so. Okay, cool. Oh good. I just thought I'd ask I just yeah, they're gonna
[52:53.780 --> 52:57.540]  They're gonna be going under HPS and probably a week
[52:58.580 --> 53:00.580]  thousand watt and
[53:00.820 --> 53:04.420]  So they're not gonna be living in this tent probably very much longer
[53:04.820 --> 53:06.820]  But this was a temporary solution
[53:06.820 --> 53:11.300]  I might keep them in here a little bit longer if I have a mite problem because I just
[53:11.460 --> 53:13.460]  Issues with some other stuff
[53:14.100 --> 53:19.220]  But which ones you which ones are those right now you got which ones are you running again?
[53:19.780 --> 53:21.300]  XFB
[53:21.300 --> 53:22.900]  Oh, gee
[53:22.900 --> 53:24.900]  Yeah, yeah
[53:24.980 --> 53:32.100]  Yeah, I really love these things and they are they look very OG like there's they look either very OG or very much
[53:32.100 --> 53:35.620]  just some sort of more sativa like kind of thing, but the
[53:35.620 --> 53:41.060]  OG ones are so pretty because they got these really really thick thick leaves and I really love that and
[53:42.020 --> 53:46.020]  It's just it's a joy to grow and just to be able to do this
[53:47.620 --> 53:50.340]  Coastal what what point how old are they here?
[53:50.340 --> 54:02.240]  I brought a picture from the daggers at that Academy that by the way
[54:02.240 --> 54:06.880]  Everybody can get on if it's in the it's in the set is in the description down below
[54:06.880 --> 54:11.600]  So I'll put that link in the description down below and I'll put that link in the description down below
[54:11.760 --> 54:13.760]  So is in the description down below
[54:14.600 --> 54:17.880]  to check out dagger dot Academy and be able to check this out, but
[54:18.840 --> 54:22.600]  this this is your post that you've shown here coastal right and
[54:23.480 --> 54:29.240]  So what do we have? These are the set what at what age are they looking? They're looking really sharp, too
[54:29.240 --> 54:31.660]  They look quite nice. Tell me a little bit about what's going on here
[54:33.000 --> 54:40.060]  Honestly, I I can't even remember how long I just started them as soon as Peter sent the sent them
[54:41.060 --> 54:43.940]  Other day he sent him I got him going and
[54:44.620 --> 54:45.780]  and
[54:45.780 --> 54:51.320]  That that's what two three weeks ago. I think so. They're a little further than that now
[54:52.380 --> 54:54.380]  but uh
[54:54.980 --> 55:01.260]  Four weeks my wife says at least four does I'm gonna say four to six weeks in probably
[55:04.180 --> 55:08.460]  But uh, yeah, I don't even keep track of any of this stuff anymore I've had
[55:09.420 --> 55:12.180]  More than ten strokes and my memory is totally gone
[55:12.180 --> 55:18.100]  So I just I just go with it as I can because it's just a fun like hobby to do right now. So I
[55:20.660 --> 55:23.700]  Just go with it and I don't even measure the weeks anymore
[55:24.660 --> 55:31.060]  You can feel the plant but it makes exact those have like way you can see like a major
[55:31.420 --> 55:35.900]  Difference in structure of the leaf in the shape of the plant in comparison
[55:36.220 --> 55:40.260]  To those San Fernando valleys in the ice cream cake like they're clearly
[55:41.740 --> 55:46.940]  Completely different beasts like and they have been affected completely differently, which is very cool. Totally
[55:47.500 --> 55:49.500]  Got a longer pointy or leaf a
[55:50.420 --> 55:52.980]  Lot of differences I see there too. That's cool
[55:55.100 --> 55:57.100]  That's cool
[55:57.100 --> 55:59.100]  The weeks anyway
[56:00.540 --> 56:02.540]  They're ready when they're ready
[56:03.380 --> 56:08.580]  Everything it takes it takes how long it takes, you know, I'm like they're hanging around for a while
[56:08.580 --> 56:14.420]  You're like you're taking too long and I take notice to that. You know, I mean, they don't know like he's taking too long
[56:14.420 --> 56:17.740]  Maybe I'll pay attention a little bit a little closer, but really
[56:18.420 --> 56:24.660]  Yeah, I don't count anything. It just is what it is. All that matters is with what it's like in the jar and
[56:25.420 --> 56:27.420]  It was like a
[56:27.500 --> 56:29.020]  pleasure to grow
[56:29.020 --> 56:32.660]  You know, so it was easy to grow you'll do it again
[56:32.660 --> 56:38.380]  And if it was great in the jar, you'll do it again, you know, so that's two for two, you know, so
[56:41.380 --> 56:46.340]  Can it can I ask a little bit about your opinions on curing when it comes to your
[56:46.860 --> 56:48.540]  what you're running and
[56:49.540 --> 56:57.000]  Because like I find some plants like I I've got like I just recently did a run of a few things if you know to
[56:57.340 --> 57:02.660]  Of my run is like fucking berries like like like blue razz
[57:02.860 --> 57:07.340]  Like like really what I look for when it comes to flavor profile
[57:07.340 --> 57:11.740]  But it didn't hit like a month and a half two months after the dry
[57:11.740 --> 57:16.820]  I get really needed that time to settle out and set into itself
[57:17.020 --> 57:19.620]  So, what do you are you like a fresh weed guy?
[57:20.300 --> 57:22.220]  Do you like the nice long cure stuff?
[57:22.220 --> 57:30.380]  I find some like my lemon cush needs fucking like three months before it like and then it blows up and it's like
[57:30.380 --> 57:33.860]  It's just make your mouth water. It's like really smooth
[57:34.620 --> 57:40.740]  Gives you a really nice before high but like up into that three months point. It's kind of a little bit tough
[57:40.780 --> 57:45.180]  You know, it's like not the easiest. It's a little bit rougher on the on the throat
[57:45.180 --> 57:49.220]  It's not as easy to get into so I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about that
[57:49.860 --> 57:51.860]  Yeah, man. I
[57:52.140 --> 57:56.260]  Mean number one, it depends on how empty my jars are, you know when I'm smoking it
[57:56.260 --> 58:03.080]  So if I if I'm if I'm hurting and the jars are low, you know, really your time doesn't really matter much to me at all
[58:03.080 --> 58:06.140]  You know, I mean it's it is what it is. You know what I mean?
[58:06.460 --> 58:11.020]  But you know if we got if I got full jars and you know
[58:11.020 --> 58:17.740]  Life's good and things are rolling and things that are happening. That's the whole I don't save roaches until my last eight
[58:17.740 --> 58:18.900]  You know what? I mean?
[58:18.900 --> 58:23.260]  Like I get a fucking pound to eat and I won't save any roaches until my last fucking eight
[58:24.980 --> 58:29.860]  You know, I mean I'm never you're never really out but there's like you're like man
[58:29.860 --> 58:34.460]  I just don't have that stuff that I want or I need, you know right now, you know what I mean?
[58:34.460 --> 58:35.900]  so it's like
[58:35.900 --> 58:40.900]  Sometimes so that that's number one, right so but really for me the the
[58:42.180 --> 58:44.180]  the drying process is
[58:45.300 --> 58:50.320]  The curing process in a lot of cases like I dry it for longer than a lot of people
[58:50.320 --> 58:53.740]  I'll let it hang for a little bit longer an extra day or so
[58:53.740 --> 58:57.920]  Like when people are breaking it down and starting to pull it down and measuring it with the stick
[58:57.920 --> 59:03.420]  I usually will take it until it's it's dry on the stick, you know, really dry like you try it
[59:03.580 --> 59:08.660]  But it's on that that that cusp of like man, you don't want to fuck it up too much
[59:08.660 --> 59:11.500]  You know and I never let it get too hot. I always keep it in the cool
[59:12.060 --> 59:15.060]  Cool realm somewhere, you know 50 60s
[59:15.820 --> 59:19.940]  Low as I can get it, you know what I mean? The lowest point I have a little area. That's
[59:20.780 --> 59:25.480]  You know, it doesn't matter. I have a little I have a place that I can kind of keep 50 or 60
[59:26.500 --> 59:30.060]  Pretty pretty, you know pretty easily 66 66
[59:30.980 --> 59:33.180]  67 it'll get up to sometimes, you know what I mean?
[59:33.180 --> 59:37.740]  And that's the most important thing is kind of keeping it cool for a longer period of time and a hanging on the stick
[59:37.740 --> 59:39.820]  I'll break it down hanging on you know, good
[59:40.740 --> 59:45.300]  Good foot foot and a half pieces so they all kind of fit together and I can kind of you know
[59:45.300 --> 59:51.680]  Utilize the space a little bit. I'm not hanging hopeful plants anymore with the full stock and all that jazz on there
[59:51.680 --> 59:56.460]  I break those plants down and hang them on, you know branches that are a foot foot and a half
[59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.180]  Kind of neatly organized and then keeping it cool
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.540]  You know can be
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.960]  12 days can be two weeks. You're gonna be 10 days
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.700]  It just kind of depends on the herb. You know what I mean? It's
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.260]  and then once once it's dry enough in my opinion I
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.580]  Break it down
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:26.340]  You know, I rough I rough trim it, you know, if I have enough time, I usually don't trim it very much at all
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:32.540]  a lot of those little leaves kind of cradle the bud and I just throw it in the jar, but if I really want a
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.260]  Nice jar. I want to take care of what I have. It's not special. I'll spend the time and
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.420]  Fill up some jars and trim it up properly
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:46.420]  And then like things like the Pam one and the Pam 15 Pam 15
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:52.620]  I like smoking earlier fresher when it's more on the fresh side of things. I don't know why I just
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:57.100]  It's just a little more electric, you know what I mean when it's
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.780]  Feel like you can conquer the world
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:09.780]  But the Pam one if you let it sit or so when you when you're when it's fresh you've got this great
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.900]  Skunky
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.620]  musty wine
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:20.220]  Type cheese in that kind of the background, but it's more grapey and fruity on the front end
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:27.500]  You know and then you put it in the jar and two three months goes by and you open up that jar and you crack
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.220]  The jar it's cheese. It's like really
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:37.860]  It's cheese. It's gone really cheese. It's really and it's like it can be it can be Parmesan. It can be like
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:47.020]  Cheddar, it can be like a sharp. It's it's a sharper, you know, Chris like it hits you in those cheekbones like right
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.700]  You know like wow, that's you know, that's that's some funk, you know and then
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:02:01.540]  the Pam 15 when it's fresh you get a lot of this great cough syrup and chocolate and
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.460]  like
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.780]  Incense II type notes and things like that off of it and you let that sit around and it goes to like
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:14.060]  Dark like dark chocolate and
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:23.780]  Musty funk and like dirty diapers, you know, I mean it really goes to this dark side of things where it really gets dark
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:30.780]  You know and it's good. It's really powerful and it's delicious, but it just goes from such this electric
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.740]  like
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:40.260]  Great thing to this really dark chocolatey, you know heavy-duty thing
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.220]  You know and I much prefer that when it's deal on the lighter side. So I smoke that as soon as it's dry
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.980]  the like the
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:53.460]  the more mainstream strains like the cookies the ice cream cakes the
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:59.020]  Crosses that are more mainstream, you know that I that I have that I pull I usually smoke those fresh
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:04.540]  I find I don't know if they're if they've been bred that way to where they're they're consumed that way or I like them that
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.580]  Way, I feel like they're read to get to market quick
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:13.420]  You know, I kind of feel like some of them like they're really pretty good friend
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.380]  Yeah, you could you could put on a tin hat or something and really go down that rabbit hole
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.840]  You know what? I mean? It's like how we kind of but I don't know. I have no idea
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.300]  I just usually tend to like enjoy those a little bit as soon as they're ready to go
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:31.940]  The SFV I like smoking that fresh even though if you let it sit you really get you know
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:36.980]  You really get a you know a deep a deeper a deepness to it. It's less sharp
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:41.340]  But I like that sharpness. I like that kick you in the face stuff
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.420]  I like smoking the dog walker fresh as soon as that's ready
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:49.460]  You know, I'm diving into that but I find a lot, you know, it's got to get rid of the chlorophyll
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.660]  You know, you got to dry it and we think about wet trimming
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:58.000]  Yeah, yeah, no way. Yeah, you can't do you know, you know what trim no, no
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.980]  Like a couple days before I harvest I'll go out and I'll pull off all the families
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.980]  Yeah
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.140]  You know, I mean I won't trim I'll just pull off all the big leaves
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:15.020]  For the most part and it's really crazy
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:20.140]  Because if you put it away to dry with a bunch of fucking leaves on there, it doesn't work, right?
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:25.100]  You mess things up and needs to have leaves but not have as many leaves, you know what I'm saying?
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.460]  So I strip it down a little bit like a day or two before I'm gonna harvest it and then I'll harvest it
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:34.260]  And I'll make it easier for me to get in there and hang it and throw it on the racks
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.180]  And do it that way
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.180]  But no wet trimming
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.540]  Don't want to do that
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:45.980]  You could freeze it you can do all kinds of stuff, but if you're gonna trim it to smoke it, you know, just just wait
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.940]  Coastal groans like I fucking wet trim. Fuck you guys
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.540]  Jars are full
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:09.700]  I hate you. I owe you. Oh my gosh
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.820]  I don't think there's a bigger
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.780]  When I wet trim then you could ever get oh
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:25.260]  I don't even trim. I don't trim it at all. I love the leaves
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:31.460]  I love this leaving the damn leaves on it because it protects the trichomes and we're only growing it
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:35.860]  Try to come not because we want to look at some dense bud that looks pretty
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:40.660]  So I'll leave the brown leaves and everything over it because they protect it you hang it
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:44.900]  It covers the buds and now it's the same as when you buy an onion
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:49.900]  You do you go to the like the store and go buy the onion that's got like the rotting, you know
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:54.740]  Carcass on the outside. No you get the one that's got the protective little like, you know layer of
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:00.860]  Cellulose and all that on there and that looks more fresh and it's not molding and I feel like
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:07.940]  looking at cannabis in the same manner as like fresh produce and just saying look before I go and
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:14.220]  Smoke this I'll just take one second to pull the leaves off and I'll just throw them into a pile and eventually make some keef
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.100]  Out of it or whatever, you know
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.740]  Or you could even use it as like like a I like to use it in the bottom of a bowl
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:24.660]  So then when you put the key for hash or whatever, so it doesn't pull through
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:29.340]  I mean, it's always a there's always a rate of recycle it or whatever
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:30.700]  But uh, yeah
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:37.260]  I don't I don't believe in in in trying to like pre cut it because it really does hurt it and when people put it on
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:44.120]  Racks to oh my gosh, you just you kill all those try cameras the stock kept capitate try can't really can't
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:49.940]  Put stand their own the weight of their own buds when they're sitting on those racks
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:54.080]  I've done it a thousand ways. The only way to really do it is is in
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:58.000]  Hanging it or if if you're in a desperate situation
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.880]  get a paper grocery store bags or
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.080]  Boxes like cardboard boxes and it and they'll dry out within like five days
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.160]  You'll have a usable product that stems will still be kind of wet
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.000]  So then you'd have to trim that off really fast
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.320]  Otherwise you can let it sit for another two weeks and it'll be perfectly like
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.320]  It the moisture will perfectly cure out
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.120]  But uh, that's the only way I've ever seen be successful
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:29.640]  But like trimming ahead of time is always taking a lot more time and it's always killed me
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.280]  And in the end I found I just I'd rather just be lazy and keep it simple. I
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.520]  Fucking love the onion analogy
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.600]  Like that that comparison was like I've never heard anybody say that before. I think it's fantastic
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.200]  It's the problem is it's the problem is it's the problem is it's the problem is it's the problem
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.720]  Is try to explain that to customers they go out of their mind
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.040]  Could you well, I mean people buy fucking
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.480]  Now I was just getting like man you get a lot closer trim
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:16.080]  You know wet trim and then you could ever get dry trimming and that and sometimes, you know when we were talking about space
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.520]  That's you got to
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.240]  You know when you only have one building to dry in
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.880]  And you set up of D homes in there
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.840]  and I mean you got to have all the
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:38.040]  Space you can't have all that on there, you know, and you have to kind of break it up and hang it
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.640]  You know, like I mean you can't have these full plants just sitting there hanging. They'll never dry
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:48.040]  You'll end up with a bra. You got to break it down. You got to get it stem by stem way
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.560]  it looks like
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.160]  You know and and you know, everybody has their own way, but you know
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.040]  Sometimes you just got to do what you got to do and I've noticed a little bit of difference
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:06.360]  Especially indoors like dude, you definitely the indoor stuff do not wet trim that and the oily stuff
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.440]  same way don't want trim that but like the like some of the cushy stuff like
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.720]  It's it's I haven't noticed a big more difference, you know, just the real turf stuff
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.200]  But you know, I like blue dream and shit that grows outdoor in full Sun
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.600]  That's just got a fucking lot of leaves like they're fucking. Yeah. Yeah
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.400]  I mean like the real real leafy stuff, you know
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.960]  like that stuff's got to get trimmed real close to have that bag appeal and
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:41.160]  sometimes you the only way to get it that close and to look that good is you you got a wet trim it and
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.400]  It sucks because you know what it's doing to it, you know, like everybody's gonna
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:54.380]  No one likes that, you know, and it's and there's a reason behind that because it's not the best way to go about it
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.360]  but sometimes
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.680]  Strain dependent. You got to do what you got to do, you know
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.320]  like the Brack to leaf ratio is a
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:08.200]  It's a big counter play and and how and when you need to trim that I believe
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500]  But it's just an opinion I
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:19.300]  Think you're very I don't think there's ever one wrong or completely right answer every situation
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.900]  Make it work for them
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.300]  Best tool in the toolbox is the one that you know how to use, you know
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.580]  So the one that works for you one that were right tool for the job, you know
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:38.660]  This is the way that it works, you know, so there's no bad answer. That's why it's so cool about farming
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:45.820]  Growing stuff and doing things because there's there's a million different ways to do it all kinds of ways to think about it
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:53.260]  You know, there's it's you can go deep you can be shallow. It's really neat, you know, it's a neat it's a neat thing
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.260]  You know
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.260]  So that's cool
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:04.100]  Yeah, I like how everybody can have a different way but we all end up with the same result
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.100]  You know, it's a little bit
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.660]  I
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.060]  Heard Cory's got some of the dankest weed on the fucking
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.420]  in North America from from the region conference fucking
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:28.020]  Jason Gideon was popping up in chat like that stuffs the best around I
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.780]  Had some very nice
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.780]  Nice
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.300]  Nice
[01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:49.410]  Nice man, it's awesome. Yeah, it feels good. Definitely. You know what I'm saying?
[01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:52.530]  Back bro, yeah
[01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:58.370]  I mean, that's you guys didn't think as we man people talking
[01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:06.210]  Yeah, no, it's it's what I love to do so it's nice to you know, share it with people and you know
[01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:11.490]  Get some validation for it. Really? Yes. Cool. You know that doesn't happen overnight
[01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:17.810]  We're all we're all there, you know, it's it's constantly happening
[01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:23.450]  There you go, Jason Gideon Cory grow some fire and that guy
[01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:30.370]  That guy is really cool and he definitely knows good stuff
[01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:39.930]  I'm super excited to get some of this stuff in the flower. I got some of my own stuff going in the tent next week
[01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.210]  Four weeks
[01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:49.290]  No in two weeks no week and a half I'm excited some of my first my first
[01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:54.490]  Exploration into actually breeding which has been which has been kind of fun. It's been exciting
[01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:56.890]  So we'll see how that goes. They're probably gonna get a fucking ton of herms
[01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.210]  But
[01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:06.730]  Gotta do it. This is like I've got your five here and then most of these other ones that are around here
[01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.490]  I can like open that up a little bit is the Sarawak
[01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:17.610]  Cross that I did which is Chernobyl sub cools the dank crossed with a strawberry banana from DNA genetics
[01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:22.090]  That I I did a STS femme cross like the strawberry banana
[01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:24.610]  reversed it to the to the
[01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:29.370]  Chernobyl and it's I'm pretty excited for that for that one that took the box with the flavor turns out
[01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:32.410]  But I'm gonna have so many more plants than I'm supposed to have
[01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:34.410]  I
[01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:56.850]  Got a tomato addiction going on right now
[01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:03.770]  I keep pulling nodes off and like rooting them and like someday somebody's gonna come to me to buy tomato planets
[01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:08.450]  I'm going to be ready and now I've got like 50 fucking tomato plants
[01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:14.530]  No one's come for a tomato plant off marketplace yet. So I'm hoping that the stores will run out soon
[01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.890]  So
[01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:32.090]  Yeah, did we have anything else we wanted to cover tonight or should we wait for a little bit and and I think in
[01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:36.010]  It's I think two weeks from now. I might be able to take some cuts
[01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:39.170]  Maybe we'll do that live
[01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:41.450]  Get a little bit further into it
[01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:47.690]  One that you know, we'll have some flower action on it, you know by that point too
[01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:49.690]  So that people will show something
[01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:56.890]  You know what was nuts mr. Tree so I we were talking about this before a little bit earlier
[01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:00.890]  But I was chatting I got the Italian turn on but I was chatting with this guy
[01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:07.130]  I did the show on Tuesday cannabis for breakfast with sativa creations in Italy and you know
[01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:13.330]  Like they're it's it's low THC. So it's got to be like certified under three point three percent or whatever aspect
[01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:19.770]  But it's completely over the market if you're a farmer you can grow as many plants as you want without any additional
[01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:27.050]  Licensing and sell it like at the farmers market with like your vegetables like nothing else
[01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:33.330]  Like just like next year fucking tomatoes you can that's the rain man. Yeah, you know, it's like
[01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:36.050]  $80,000 for acres over there
[01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:41.050]  Wow, it's cheap like it's the land and property like super super cheap, too
[01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:46.330]  I
[01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.250]  Yeah, that's
[01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:51.210]  That's it man. That's the dream like just to be able to like
[01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:57.210]  Have a small little farm, you know where you could grow some food fruits and some vegetables, you know
[01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:00.570]  Some peaches and the nectarine some oranges whatever, you know
[01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:06.930]  And then have some cannabis and go to a farmers markets, you know around your area and be able to sell that stuff
[01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:12.570]  You know, like there's no reason why it shouldn't be that way. That is like the ultimate dream, you know
[01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:15.530]  Like I don't need much. We don't need to like blow up the fucking world
[01:16:15.690 --> 01:16:20.970]  you don't need to like get crazy and like bill it's like like they would just allow like
[01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:26.010]  simple farmers to like have have you know the ability to like
[01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:27.250]  grow your
[01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:32.810]  vegetables for a little bit of cannabis and then take that to the farmers market and just sell it the same way as you
[01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:35.850]  Could for fruits or vegetables because it doesn't take it costs like
[01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:42.450]  Costs like a hundred bucks or something to have like an inspector come out to your property here or whatever and like inspect it for
[01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:44.650]  you know
[01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:49.250]  Like your processes of growing your you're not growing like a toxic field or something
[01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.850]  You know what? I mean?
[01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:54.530]  But other than that like you can get a license and you pay for a little license just a couple hundred dollars
[01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:58.530]  It's like not even a big deal and then you can take your fruits and vegetables and go sell them down
[01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:00.690]  at all the farmers markets and
[01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:05.810]  Go anywhere and kind of just make deals with with different little small markets and shit
[01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:09.730]  and it's like I can't you know, why can't you just like kick over to like
[01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:15.690]  Just just that you know, that's the dream but it will be one day, you know, if we don't kill each other
[01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:17.530]  Well, you know we'll get there, you know
[01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:24.770]  So I don't know who that they are, but it seems like they don't want farmers to do a lot of stuff
[01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:27.570]  from what I
[01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.970]  Yeah, we need to make they we you know, cuz that's all it is
[01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:38.010]  So they show up to meetings and like there's nobody else there to make the rules. So they make them for us
[01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.010]  But they make some dumb ones
[01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:41.570]  It's like it's like, you know
[01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:43.250]  like really like
[01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:47.730]  If you got time and you don't got a bunch of shit and you can do something you want to make a difference show up
[01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:50.250]  to some meetings and like vote for us a
[01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:53.450]  Fucking little farmers, you know what I mean? It'd be cool, you know
[01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:55.450]  so
[01:17:55.450 --> 01:18:02.130]  No, I I just thought it was genius and and the way it should develop in the necessary market
[01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:05.010]  Like it just it makes so much fucking sense to me
[01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:10.570]  And it's just like especially in a time when we're all like trying to make it out of this shithole of the last couple years
[01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:14.450]  You know what? I mean? Like we're all just trying to make keep our heads above water
[01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:17.810]  It's like that's got to be the way to do it
[01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:22.210]  You got to create it as much of an open market as possible for people will be able to get it
[01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:29.570]  I mean you got a bureaucracies bureaucracy wherever you go, but like it shouldn't cost you ten million dollars
[01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:31.570]  People are in the chat like 80 K's
[01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:36.650]  So expensive for an acre is like I'm in Vancouver BC right now
[01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:43.370]  farmland undeveloped with zero water advantages electrical like anything is
[01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:52.370]  $250,000 an acre that it like it's like you're nothing you're cut off from the world in rural fucking Canada
[01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:54.730]  But
[01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:59.730]  It's like that's so 80 K is like ridiculously cheap in a fully urban
[01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:06.930]  I like you know, you're next to a city and in a developed place with like high-speed internet and utility water and everything like that
[01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:10.450]  Set up, you know, like I can't even hope to afford a house here
[01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:18.930]  It's there's no way it goes up faster than I can save money. It's fucked. It's like it's gone up two million dollars in last year's
[01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.010]  Insane
[01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:27.610]  Absolutely absolutely killer, but it's it's like neat to see opportunities like like in the EU they they have
[01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:33.490]  They put in like 360 billion dollars into small farm applications
[01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:36.890]  so if you like if you want to develop like, you know and
[01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:38.970]  regenerative style farm
[01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:45.250]  You can get like a hundred thousand dollar grant from the government and develop your farm and actually put your put your stuff into it
[01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:47.250]  It's like what the fuck are we doing?
[01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:50.250]  In Canada
[01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:53.570]  You know in the world where it's just like in the world
[01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:59.050]  Yeah, the dumbest shit fucking ever, you know, it doesn't make a lot of sense
[01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:04.170]  Introspective later, I've had a long exhausting week
[01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:07.090]  And I'm tired
[01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:09.090]  But I loved it
[01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:18.050]  Yeah, good well you got a fucking crazy one how many plant how many plants do you put out in the in the spring there
[01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:20.050]  mr. Trees
[01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:24.170]  Well, there's there's no like there's never an exact number of plants. It's
[01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:27.130]  Yeah, I get it, you know
[01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:31.850]  I get what I'm allowed to have here and then I get to see all all the plants at
[01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:38.450]  Like my clients places so like people are growing fruit trees and other stuff like we're always we we max them on out what they're
[01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:42.410]  Allowed to have at their place and then and so on so there's several
[01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:46.730]  I mean several places where I get to go see some of the genetics that are growing
[01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:49.330]  So I get a look at
[01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:57.770]  You know hundreds of plants of whatever varieties that I choose for that year for for certain places, which is kind of cool. So
[01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:00.530]  This year we're gonna put out some
[01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:07.290]  Of the Kandahar stuff we're gonna do more royal cushions because of the outdoor stuff we're gonna do more royal cush Kandahar
[01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:14.290]  And there might be a couple random things that I'll that I'll give out some fems and some stuff to my close buddies
[01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:15.810]  but for all like the
[01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:21.090]  You know the people that get just free seeds and we just plant a little garden next to their other gardens for their you know
[01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:23.090]  for their family and stuff, but
[01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:29.810]  Yeah, they'll be mostly royal cush Kandahar just for I know that they'll be bulletproof type stuff for outside
[01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:32.850]  And we'll get a see a lot of those flowers. So big, you know
[01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:37.290]  At least at least a couple hundred of those which will be nice
[01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:45.850]  So that's it sounds like it until I run out of energy or people to put plants in places
[01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:54.290]  It's you know, I'm you know, I've it's it's kind of a weird world where I
[01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:57.850]  Get it I get to help people
[01:21:57.970 --> 01:21:59.930]  Give them advice
[01:21:59.930 --> 01:22:02.570]  You know help with their fruit trees and other things like that
[01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:09.370]  And then there there's just a subgroup of people that are just normal cool people that do do canvas, too
[01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:12.090]  You know what? I mean? So it's like hey, you're my buddy
[01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:17.290]  You're my you're my friends and I just I'll give them seeds and then in that relationship
[01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:21.530]  I get to see those seeds because I take care of the trees anyway, you know what I mean?
[01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.530]  And it's just like it's like the win-win of
[01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.090]  Everything you know what I mean? So
[01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:27.970]  It's just a weird
[01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:35.050]  Yeah, so as long as I'm doing my thing I can see some stuff and it's kind of neat and everybody else has their own
[01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:38.370]  Way of doing things which is kind of cool and they all are you know?
[01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:44.330]  Cool type people that that like taking care of their their plants and their trees and other stuff. So they're always
[01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:51.130]  Interested in telling me what's going on in the garden? What's what what they're doing what they're not doing
[01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:54.410]  This one's getting sick. This one's not you know things like that
[01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:59.850]  So I get it really kind of see it from from a couple a couple different sets of eyes, which is kind of nice
[01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:03.490]  and then some of those I get you know, like
[01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:07.630]  You know some of those places that there's one makes wines with all
[01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:12.590]  He gives next wine and apricot wine a few years before that
[01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:16.370]  He makes every year out of all the trees that we take care of right, you know
[01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:21.610]  He's been given some cannabis and stuff. So you get some stuff back which is kind of neat and it's just a cool little
[01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:29.370]  Just a cool little world, you know, you get more people growing food and trees you you know, yeah, you know, that's good and
[01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:34.050]  Everything it's all good. You know, no negativity there, you know, so
[01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:40.770]  It's yeah, I'll get a see quite a few, you know, but what for my personal smoke, it'll be all
[01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:43.290]  clones
[01:23:43.290 --> 01:23:46.050]  so last year I did I did seed and
[01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:53.290]  It hurt my hurt my jars for the for the gear, you know, so I did all seed, you know, I didn't do enough
[01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:55.610]  I thought I did enough and I could you know, so
[01:23:56.450 --> 01:24:02.730]  This year I'm gonna do just fire just just a small fire patch. It'll be nice. That'll be nice
[01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:09.930]  I'll fill up the jars and then we'll I'll look at everybody else's stuff out. I'll let them do the seat which will be nice
[01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:12.770]  so
[01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:15.330]  Go for it coastal
[01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:23.450]  So, um, I am kind of hating myself because I'm going to basically have a giant haze orgy
[01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:26.610]  And basically knock up
[01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:30.210]  Tony's days
[01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:32.490]  from bone yard
[01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:37.490]  with Todd McCormick purple haze, you know males
[01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:38.770]  Oh
[01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:40.770]  pollen as well as
[01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:47.250]  The can doors and a whole bunch of other shit because I'm just gonna just have stuff at my neighbor's house, too
[01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:50.810]  so I'll be able to make a few little fucking crosses and
[01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:55.010]  Unfortunately, I'm like, oh shit. I'm not gonna be able to get any bud
[01:24:55.010 --> 01:25:00.130]  It's just gonna be all seed but whatever I do get I'm gonna try to selectively pollinate
[01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:05.130]  But whatever I do that I'm gonna try to see if I can share with you know, whoever I can
[01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:08.450]  And see what comes out of it
[01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:14.730]  because I think it'll be really interesting to see like a purple like energy crossed with a
[01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:19.050]  Purple haze and just just whatever that crazy
[01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:23.410]  Cross comes up with you know, just just let it go, you know
[01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:26.450]  But yeah, I'd really like to share that with everybody
[01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:31.130]  It's always cool looking at any seeds, you know for the first time
[01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:38.450]  It's kind of looked at it, you know, so it's kind of neat it's here you pop them and you grow them
[01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:40.450]  so they're kind of like you're
[01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:42.690]  you're you're you're
[01:25:43.050 --> 01:25:46.810]  Responsibility, you know what? I mean in a weird way. So it's it's cool. It's
[01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:51.690]  Doesn't matter what they are man, you know, you make them it's something special about it
[01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:55.730]  They're always there's always gonna be something good with it. You know, it's cool. I encourage that
[01:25:57.450 --> 01:25:59.450]  Everything
[01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:03.410]  There's a mischievous person that just slid into the into the
[01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:09.850]  Did you see that? Yeah, that is is he good? Do you think he's gonna speak up or he's just here to snoop?
[01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:14.730]  Yeah, I he doesn't know that I turned on the ding so that you can't
[01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:22.450]  But I've been getting good using these things, you know, I've been getting good I've been doing lots of stuff here
[01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:26.930]  I'm getting getting better at this, you know, so I saw that sliding
[01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:31.770]  Is he gonna speak up no, he's not
[01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:34.290]  so next week
[01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:36.490]  We'll try next while we're two weeks out
[01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:41.330]  but I think we need to switch which day of the week that we're doing it on because
[01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:43.010]  last
[01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:49.570]  Because each time we try and do it on a Friday. I've realized that we're perfectly aligned with Chad Westport's
[01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:57.330]  Bi-weekly Friday like we've accidentally fallen on the same Friday there and I and you know, I don't want to get in Chad
[01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:03.770]  Gorgeous I don't want to get strangled by that gorgeous hair, you know, he's pretty close to me over the border
[01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:05.770]  I'd like to I'd like to break bread with them
[01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:15.010]  Yeah, so I mean I kind of like Saturdays or Sundays are pretty good
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:20.690]  They're pretty quiet nice and we get a lot of awesome people into this space that seem to enjoy the conversation as well
[01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:24.130]  So I think like which which day works best for y'all
[01:27:24.130 --> 01:27:26.130]  I
[01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:29.490]  Had to say y'all cuz you wearing a cowboy hat
[01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:34.290]  So set like
[01:27:34.570 --> 01:27:40.350]  Saturdays are probably the best day for me for kids and other stuff. They got to go to school on Monday
[01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:47.090]  But I can do yeah, I can do either one that can make it make it work. You know, that's not the end of the world
[01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:48.050]  but
[01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:53.650]  If we're if we're picking from Saturday and Sunday, then you know, I'll throw I'll throw Saturday and in there
[01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:59.010]  I'm in for Saturday as well, but I could do both same thing. Yeah
[01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:02.890]  I'm good with Saturday
[01:28:04.690 --> 01:28:10.690]  All right, that's three for making it that we're good for good to go for Saturday and Nick Nick's like fuck you
[01:28:10.690 --> 01:28:12.690]  I don't want Saturday and
[01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:16.290]  Don't go
[01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:18.890]  Did you disagree with
[01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:22.490]  I'll see if he if he if he just
[01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:28.850]  And that's that's the thing, you know most that's like the best night of the week, you know, you're like
[01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.730]  You're out of the town causing a ruckus
[01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:38.970]  Ready to burn the place down that's that's a tough night for some people, you know, that's a good night for me
[01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:42.750]  I'm good with Saturday, too
[01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:48.290]  I think it's it's an excellent day and a lot of it's a lot of people like to there's not nothing going on
[01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:53.830]  You know what I mean and it's it's it's it's a good time to come together and chat and have
[01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:56.890]  Conversations say I can't wait to see these things get fucking huge
[01:28:56.890 --> 01:29:02.290]  I I think I'm probably gonna take the original mothers and plug them all outside
[01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:08.330]  And just see what the fuck happens and see how they survive in the Canadian harshness
[01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:12.330]  Which will be good like just as a point of perspective
[01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:18.050]  I have mums out and out and like they're with a light in this space so that they're not flipping
[01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:24.770]  But I have mums fully outdoor right now. That'll just sit and they'll be able to survive it gets down to six
[01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:26.970]  but like so
[01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:32.370]  Grosses stopped like it's it's done, but like it doesn't it doesn't move very much
[01:29:32.410 --> 01:29:37.010]  But they do survive at this temperature. So they'll probably hit the same
[01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:39.690]  by late September
[01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:45.410]  Probably in there yeah, no I love that too that any type of those jerk
[01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:52.050]  It's like that's killer like when when Josh ran ran a bunch of stuff up north and up in Bellingham
[01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:56.450]  You know it's like wow that's that's killer. I got a lot of good feedback from from that you know
[01:29:57.010 --> 01:30:00.370]  You know down in the south they get a lot of stuff from like you know
[01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:05.330]  Georgia and Tennessee and Carolinas and places like it's kind of interesting you know
[01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:11.930]  Cool stuff so I like I like that so you're up there in the north that would be cool to have something out there
[01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:15.970]  That you know a man or rotted right away or whatever
[01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.130]  I
[01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:20.930]  Want to try doing light depth in my back
[01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:25.370]  I have a big 10 by 8 green like box, and I've been wanting to do light depth
[01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:32.970]  So I might try and play with that at some point as well. See how that goes just I'm nervous
[01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:38.330]  Just because it's already that we already already have so much moisture like our temperature fluctuates so much
[01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:42.810]  And I'm surrounded by very tar very large
[01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:48.110]  Deciduous trees that like to cover themselves in powdery mildew because I'm right on the ocean
[01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:51.050]  So it's like it just it scares the crap out of me
[01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:55.210]  So I don't know if there's better shade cloth or things to use to like make that work better
[01:30:55.210 --> 01:30:57.650]  But I'm gonna have to do some research on that yeah
[01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:02.330]  You can't you're not gonna be able to pull pull off light depth all the way if you're using shade cloths
[01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:07.050]  You need to black it out all the way. You know yeah, you're screwed either way best thing
[01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:11.370]  I can say is get some fans that move out move move that fucking air
[01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:15.930]  You know what I mean out of there. You know conceal it in some way to make it to where you can
[01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:19.490]  You can get get that air evacuated pretty quickly
[01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:25.090]  You know cuz they out here you do light depth which we do some stuff here and there it gets so hot
[01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:28.650]  It's like by you're trying to cover them up. You know in
[01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:34.610]  Anything in an evening here, it's still 90 degrees. You know so underneath that that tarp
[01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:37.490]  It gets really hot like it's really hot really quick
[01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:44.090]  and that pisses them off a lot of the time so a bigger more air and
[01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:53.490]  Movement of that air in some capacity is like the only way that I've ever found that I can grow them without them being too
[01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:56.010]  Pissed off and actually doing something you know what I mean
[01:31:56.610 --> 01:31:58.610]  So it's that's good
[01:31:59.730 --> 01:32:04.530]  It's good battle. No way I got time you got it right on time, dude
[01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:08.090]  Don't be fucking late. Oh my god
[01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:14.330]  I'm sitting here at Red Lobster, and I was supposed to cover him ten minutes ago. I'll be they'll be fine
[01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:17.930]  I'll be a half an hour. It's like you do that a couple times a week, dude
[01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:23.490]  It's like yeah, you're you're screwing stuff up, dude, so yeah, you got me on time. Yeah for sure
[01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:30.570]  Yeah, you got a lit you can't leave the garden like even going for three fucking days for like a vacation
[01:32:30.570 --> 01:32:32.690]  You can't you can't fucking step away
[01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:39.850]  But you know you know what I do have is I actually have a spare duct like a duct fan like a power high power
[01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:45.370]  One yeah, I was like I could just I could just plug that in there and get it on 15 minute time
[01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:47.050]  Yeah, once an hour and flush it
[01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:52.290]  I got these solar fans man that they're like these solar panels that are connected to these little fans
[01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:57.570]  And you plug these little fans and like the greenhouse or build your own little thing and like stick in places
[01:32:57.570 --> 01:33:00.010]  You know what I mean those are so killer dude like
[01:33:00.650 --> 01:33:02.570]  You know I mean you can't do a ton with them
[01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:05.690]  But I mean if you're just doing little light depth things and other stuff like that
[01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:08.210]  And it's like just the last couple hours, and you got Sun
[01:33:08.370 --> 01:33:12.130]  It's like that's nice where you are at you might not have the Sun as easy as me
[01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:16.570]  You know so I could run things on the Sun still but so that Sun goes away unless you get a charge
[01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:18.570]  You're no good anymore. You know so
[01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:23.890]  Yeah as long as I can get as long as I really just need to get him started a little bit
[01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:27.330]  I just need them like by August 1st them to start
[01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:34.490]  Leaning in and then by you know I can just I only really need to tie it to black him out for like two three
[01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:36.490]  Weeks just to get a headway of
[01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:40.690]  The season so they don't so you're not like struggling to get deep in the flower
[01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:47.530]  And they're like just hitting by September. I can't tell you like I I grew I put a GG number four down
[01:33:47.690 --> 01:33:53.530]  That was like itself, and I put it in that four by eight bed. Just one plant. I started in in
[01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:56.490]  December the year prior to
[01:33:56.610 --> 01:34:03.450]  And like got it huge got like the eight by eight filled it right up got it about six and a half feet tall like
[01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:05.530]  massive plant and I
[01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:08.130]  Thrown out so much weed
[01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:11.650]  It's like every day rot rot
[01:34:12.650 --> 01:34:14.650]  Yeah
[01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:17.530]  It was sucky in a
[01:34:18.650 --> 01:34:21.850]  Living by the water hell it is hell I
[01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:26.130]  Never never saw rot until I live by the water
[01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:29.450]  And it was like I was growing woody from nerd genetics
[01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:36.610]  And it it was just this very very dense chunky like chonker chonk fucking no GK fucking cross
[01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:44.010]  And it was so nice, and then I started seeing this white just rot and I was like oh my gosh
[01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.810]  How the hell is this happening?
[01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:50.050]  And it's only because that humidity especially near the coast you
[01:34:50.370 --> 01:34:55.930]  It really is preferable to just grow hazes by the coast and then inland you can do the like
[01:34:56.850 --> 01:35:04.810]  The harder buds that the denser buds, but I feel like if you're by the coast just do like what like people did in Santa Cruz
[01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:06.730]  You know all that
[01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:13.890]  Do they do haze I feel like that's the best way to keep from the rot, and I mean it's a better product anyway
[01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:16.810]  You might only get one yield a year
[01:35:17.490 --> 01:35:19.170]  but I
[01:35:19.170 --> 01:35:21.170]  think that's probably
[01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:22.850]  the smarter
[01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:29.370]  Or just at least the hybrids and Neville's or like even I guess if you want to go with the super silver even though
[01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:33.730]  And that is a good one, but that leans more towards that that that denser
[01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:39.730]  Kind of bud and and you know the denser it gets the more you risk that that that bud rot
[01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:44.710]  Especially if you're doing it outdoors near the water. I mean, I'm literally on the water so
[01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:47.130]  It is help
[01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:54.730]  Sometimes me too brother. I'm like right off right on like a half a block away from from from the from the water
[01:35:55.370 --> 01:36:02.730]  Pretty close to I always um I actually did you speak to that and I like I did a cross and a copoco gold
[01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:04.530]  landrace
[01:36:04.530 --> 01:36:11.930]  From he was actually in a chat earlier from Delman, and I'm gonna be harvesting the plants in a week and a half
[01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:17.850]  Because I've cried took took one of the boys out of that and crossed it into my lemon cush headband
[01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:21.650]  And kind of sprayed the tent down a little bit with some of their pollen
[01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:28.690]  So I'll get a lot of fun stuff to play out of that. I'm really excited that lemon cush is one of my favorite plants
[01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:37.410]  It's got a great lemony flavor it's like sweet toned as well. It's not just like like lemon. It's like sweet lemon
[01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:42.290]  So I'm really excited to see kind of how that'll turn out
[01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:46.590]  But I'll probably need to bring it in down or down one or two lines
[01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:50.290]  But I'm not too sure how many seeds I'm gonna get if you mentioned mr.
[01:36:50.290 --> 01:36:55.730]  Trees it's like it's always about you put a bunch out and then you you you test a bunch of then you don't quite have enough
[01:36:55.730 --> 01:36:57.490]  jars to make it through
[01:36:57.490 --> 01:36:59.290]  And I'm like at that point right now
[01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:05.850]  I'm like I'm gonna have to do a big batch of dry sift if I'm gonna make it through to my next harvest right now
[01:37:05.850 --> 01:37:09.130]  Cuz I've been fucking around too much gotta put my aid in
[01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:14.950]  Take my aid out and get my fucking eight jars every three fucking weeks. Otherwise, I'm gonna run out and then I go
[01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:18.610]  Oh my god, I'm smoking eight jars every three weeks great. That's
[01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:27.330]  Goes yeah, I've been you know, I used to be just like all out do just you know
[01:37:27.490 --> 01:37:32.570]  And I would never I would never be be mapped out the way you you know what I mean?
[01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:35.890]  so I finally figured out that yeah, I got a
[01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.450]  got a focus in and you got to do things but
[01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:45.610]  You know, you definitely got to cover your ass, you know, I mean because when you look at too much
[01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:51.650]  In the end, you don't see as much as you'd like, you know what I mean? It's just the way it goes, you know, so
[01:37:53.130 --> 01:37:54.650]  Gotta
[01:37:54.650 --> 01:38:00.170]  Get up to the head it's easier to plant them than it is to cut them dry them and hang them
[01:38:02.530 --> 01:38:08.010]  I could put I could plants three million plants in spring, but I definitely can't harvest that man
[01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:12.930]  That's one thing and then most of those aren't gonna be the one that you want, you know what I mean?
[01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:16.970]  It's like one whole bunch of those dip, you know a whole bunch of something, you know, it's like oh
[01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:21.130]  Well, it's just this one and it's always the smallest plant to like yield the least amount
[01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:28.870]  You know, whatever and it's like oh well now I have all this other stuff that you know, I don't like you know
[01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:33.850]  I hate that, you know, it's nothing worse than like having weed but not having weed, you know, I mean
[01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:40.890]  Smoke this again don't like this fire that is better than most
[01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:45.970]  But you know, it's the jar I don't want today
[01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:47.970]  Exactly
[01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:52.010]  You could be smoking dispensary weed, you know
[01:38:53.210 --> 01:38:59.410]  Buddy of mine calls that the the our jar. He has the my jar in the our jar
[01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:01.730]  He puts that on the our jar
[01:39:02.530 --> 01:39:04.530]  Yeah
[01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:10.890]  People love me though, cuz you know my dad and stuff they don't have to worry about it
[01:39:10.890 --> 01:39:14.730]  You know, my mom's like, okay guys can have that. It's all good. So
[01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:18.770]  It goes it gets used, you know
[01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:28.010]  All right, well I think we will call it an evening postal grown OG did you want to say anything before we go?
[01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:31.250]  No, just happy to be here as always
[01:39:32.290 --> 01:39:34.290]  That's about it
[01:39:34.330 --> 01:39:40.690]  I'll be posting some pictures. This is still like kind of the boring part of the grow cuz it's just dead. So
[01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:45.450]  It'll just be more pictures that look kind of the same. But yeah
[01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:47.970]  Oh my god, how did it are?
[01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:51.050]  We all doing it. Are we all available to have an outdoor?
[01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:59.050]  Like our Corey, can you do outdoor? Oh, yeah. Yep. I'm gonna probably do one of each
[01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:07.050]  I get the SFB and the Royal I I'm gonna run both. I'm hoping hoping to get both of them to go all the way
[01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:10.330]  Oh
[01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:15.250]  Yeah, I'm doing that I'm doing who gets the tallest plant out of the batch
[01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:20.930]  Like see if we can try and like go now I now I fucking talk to them all
[01:40:35.690 --> 01:40:41.290]  I'm gonna definitely right. I am for sure doing the pure stock this year. So
[01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:44.250]  The pure Canada hard reds
[01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:47.250]  I'm I'm gonna look through there for females
[01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:51.570]  Female only I'm not looking at any males in this in this group
[01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:57.610]  So I'm gonna do that and then I'm gonna pull those and then I'll do you know a couple of those outside
[01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:00.630]  So you have any experience with that smoke?
[01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:08.530]  Yeah, actually I have a little bit of experience in in the seeded bud because right when I got the stuff
[01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:13.890]  I didn't open pollination and in that pollination. I made all this stuff. I
[01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:16.770]  preserved it, you know in seed form and
[01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:23.850]  Then all that the flower that I shucked out of those females that are in there were in dry sift and stuff and all the stuff
[01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:26.570]  That fell through in the trim bin and whatnot, you know what I mean?
[01:41:26.730 --> 01:41:29.190]  So I got a I got a smoke some of the you know
[01:41:29.190 --> 01:41:34.330]  Some teeth cleaned it up a little bit and smoked some of the Keith and it was it was heavy-duty
[01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:36.850]  It was nasty
[01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:39.370]  It
[01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:42.450]  It was it was somebody nasty on it on the cheesy
[01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:47.250]  Nasty was so it was like it was like it was like rotten type cheesy
[01:41:49.530 --> 01:41:54.530]  Musty type type chirps that were coming off of it, but it was dry sip. So I mean it's it's hashy
[01:41:54.610 --> 01:41:58.170]  It's already it's already kicked out a little bit and I wasn't dabbing it
[01:41:58.170 --> 01:41:58.570]  You know what?
[01:41:58.570 --> 01:42:04.410]  I mean or pressing it or anything like that was going on top of on top of bowls or just in the in the little hash
[01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:06.210]  pipe, you know
[01:42:06.210 --> 01:42:09.410]  but it wasn't it there was not a fruity note to be seen and
[01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:12.810]  It was definitely like it was powerful and long
[01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:17.930]  Expanding and it was you knew that you were fucking smoking something that had some strips some strong power
[01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:20.890]  Which is why I'm doing this
[01:42:21.170 --> 01:42:26.770]  Pure female run this time around. So I want to see the females and they're real kind of in the Sun
[01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:31.410]  And they're real way that the things are gonna go. We're gonna grow a couple of the girls and
[01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:35.970]  Really see how nasty we can get them. You know, I mean, yep
[01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:40.530]  So and in the meantime, we've been growing these the critters and all that other stuff
[01:42:40.530 --> 01:42:46.850]  And but I finally started a bunch of the pure stuff not too long ago. So those ones will be going outside the females
[01:42:48.690 --> 01:42:53.750]  I'm excited to see what type of variants and variety of variability. Yeah, you know
[01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:58.290]  It'd be nice to look at those and be able to show them see some of the stuff that's going
[01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:02.080]  Cool
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:09.680]  Alrighty well, we will end this show everybody to the wave and have a wonderful night. Don't forget to check out dagger Academy
