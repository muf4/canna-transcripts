[00:00.760 --> 00:12.400]  So the good news is that we can cut out in post-production the first like 10
[00:12.400 --> 00:18.160]  minutes of this conversation. So let's pretend like we're starting right now.
[00:18.160 --> 00:29.720]  So let me... I don't know if Layton's... no that's his home.
[00:29.720 --> 00:38.120]  Alright let me... Layton's off. Oh man, are you kidding me? Layton went out to Best Buy.
[00:38.120 --> 00:46.440]  Terry can you hear us? Did we just lose Terry? No I'm here, can you hear me?
[00:46.440 --> 00:57.620]  Yeah but we can't see you anymore. Did you just do something? We need the camera
[00:57.620 --> 01:08.420]  back. Now we see you, now we see you. Yep yep Terry's back. This shit is unreal
[01:08.420 --> 01:18.380]  today brother. Alright. You're back, you're back. We see you. We're good, we're good.
[01:18.380 --> 01:25.060]  Alright, take it away Brian. Yeah alright so train on the tracks kind of Thursday
[01:25.060 --> 01:29.820]  putting this together. Danny I'm excited for us to be able to interview you today
[01:29.820 --> 01:34.020]  because you know you were a part, a major part of the hustle and educate
[01:34.180 --> 01:38.780]  little thing we had there in Oklahoma and I felt like you were you know the
[01:38.780 --> 01:41.780]  one that really resonated with the crowd but because you were kind of like
[01:41.780 --> 01:45.540]  walking around doing Q&A as you were doing more of kind of what I've always
[01:45.540 --> 01:48.420]  known as like the dog and pony show where you're kind of just showing off
[01:48.420 --> 01:52.580]  your cannabis, showing off other people's cannabis and your style of squishing
[01:52.580 --> 01:56.420]  that kind of stuff. So you know our viewers especially a lot of them
[01:56.420 --> 02:00.700]  they're moving down that process of that A to Z process which is something that I
[02:00.780 --> 02:04.100]  admire about you that you've you know openly shared that you're self-taught. I
[02:04.100 --> 02:07.780]  think the majority of people in the industry that's the kind of stuff that
[02:07.780 --> 02:12.460]  we love to actually see where you know just someone that's taking the time to
[02:12.460 --> 02:18.380]  educate themselves on another level and continue to push themselves. I know you
[02:18.380 --> 02:22.620]  have the the white blueberries was something that was really popping off
[02:22.620 --> 02:27.660]  for you in Oklahoma out there. I'd love to talk about that as well but you know
[02:27.660 --> 02:32.900]  for those that haven't seen the Hustle and Educate I wanted to
[02:32.900 --> 02:39.180]  kind of give you a quick shout out on that. At one hour and 18 minutes you
[02:39.180 --> 02:42.380]  can kind of see more of what he's talking about and it's off the cuff so
[02:42.380 --> 02:46.540]  it's definitely going to be beneficial to obviously watch you today sir as well
[02:46.540 --> 02:50.540]  as watch from that Hustle and Educate event because I felt like you gave a
[02:50.540 --> 02:54.940]  lot of off-the-cuff answers, a lot of detailed answers to a lot of the
[02:54.940 --> 02:59.620]  questions in the room and just showing off other people's flower with your
[02:59.620 --> 03:02.980]  technique especially what we're going to do today. I feel like a lot of viewers
[03:02.980 --> 03:06.940]  might not have personally seen that process so it's something that I'm
[03:06.940 --> 03:16.120]  excited to show off. All right Danny so like I had mentioned you're self-taught
[03:16.120 --> 03:19.260]  so you kind of want to talk about some of your OGs, some of your mentors
[03:19.260 --> 03:23.260]  besides yourself. I know that even when you're self-taught a lot of people are
[03:23.260 --> 03:27.660]  still you know teaching you and guiding you in certain ways or influencing you
[03:27.660 --> 03:31.580]  definitely because I feel like there's a lot of mistakes to be made in this and
[03:31.580 --> 03:35.980]  so you can minimize that just from learning and being on certain social
[03:35.980 --> 03:39.740]  media platforms and that kind of stuff. I feel like minimizing mistakes is huge
[03:39.740 --> 03:43.620]  and a lot of people don't think about that but it seems like from everything
[03:43.620 --> 03:47.020]  that I've seen from you sir you're trying to get down to that A to Z so you
[03:47.020 --> 03:51.540]  want to you know grow the best cannabis that you can in an organic fashion and a
[03:51.540 --> 03:55.980]  living soil fashion and then get down to that more what we're talking about
[03:55.980 --> 04:02.340]  today that solventless process. So let's kind of again talk about your background
[04:02.340 --> 04:05.860]  and then hopefully Layton will be here and we can really dive into the
[04:05.860 --> 04:12.060]  nitty-gritty and I appreciate everybody bearing with us working and getting this
[04:12.060 --> 04:14.780]  show on the road.
[04:14.780 --> 04:41.560]  What's going on guys? Like you said I'm Mahashley. I am self-taught. I tell people all the time I don't take anything that I say as the gold standard. I am in the learning process. I will always and the day that I tell you that I know everything is probably the day I lost my mind.
[04:41.560 --> 04:52.200]  Because this is a growing industry especially in the solventless. I mean solventless hasn't been around all that long.
[04:52.200 --> 05:06.400]  So I'm gonna say I taught myself how to grow reading a lot of books trying things
[05:06.400 --> 05:14.120]  messing up a lot of stuff. I have taken a lot of my time and my money and things
[05:14.120 --> 05:17.640]  that I've done to try to figure this out. So I haven't had many of the
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.640]  opportunities some people may have with a lot of product to be able to work with.
[05:21.640 --> 05:28.200]  So trust and believe the first time that I had got me a whole ounce of marijuana
[05:28.200 --> 05:32.600]  and tried to press it and got back maybe three grams. Yeah that was a hard day.
[05:32.600 --> 05:38.440]  I learned a lot that day. I learned that the product fire in fire out is
[05:38.440 --> 05:43.640]  definitely a real a real thing. Right now you probably hear me I'm holding up
[05:43.640 --> 05:49.000]  paper to get ready for a press. I've got some bubble hash that I did the other day.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.800]  It's been sitting in the freezer carrying. I'm gonna take some of that and press it.
[05:55.800 --> 06:01.960]  You hear me? Oh there we go. Yeah we're hitting touchdowns now. Right on.
[06:01.960 --> 06:07.480]  Yeah man we're excited to put this together now. Let's do this.
[06:07.480 --> 06:12.600]  You guys hear me? Yeah. Yep. Have you heard anything that I've said?
[06:12.600 --> 06:17.320]  We've heard every word. We've been hanging on every word.
[06:17.320 --> 06:21.800]  Yeah so like you said hustling educate. I did the hustling educate.
[06:21.800 --> 06:25.720]  It was I guess probably the second time that I've done a like a speaking
[06:25.720 --> 06:30.600]  engagement you know with this business here. I really appreciate that opportunity
[06:30.600 --> 06:35.800]  man. It worked out a whole lot. Helped me out a whole lot. Got a lot more followers and stuff like that.
[06:35.800 --> 06:39.640]  You guys got Instagram. Go check it out at
[06:43.080 --> 06:49.640]  Medicine Grower with Blueys. That is the grow page. You guys go and check that out on there.
[06:49.640 --> 06:53.960]  Everything that I do is organic. So I started out with bottled nutrients.
[06:53.960 --> 06:59.400]  Probably like most everybody did. Fox Farm was the thing that I used.
[06:59.400 --> 07:02.840]  Just trying to get into growing. Trying to figure out what the plants needed.
[07:02.840 --> 07:08.520]  Bottled nutrients made it a lot easier for me to be able to give the plant the nutrients that it needed
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.720]  without me necessarily knowing everything that was in there. So I did that for a little bit.
[07:15.320 --> 07:20.440]  It worked out okay. I got some pretty good yields. You can see at the beginning of the grow page on
[07:20.440 --> 07:25.800]  Instagram. I mean some of the stuff I'm almost embarrassed that I put online for people to see.
[07:25.800 --> 07:31.720]  But you can see my growing process. I mean from the very beginning some of the things I did to
[07:31.720 --> 07:36.280]  what my products look like now. It's a big, big difference. And all of that was trial and error.
[07:36.280 --> 07:40.280]  I mean it was stuff that I tried that worked and I was like hey we're going to keep doing it this
[07:40.280 --> 07:45.240]  way. And then there was stuff that I was like I don't ever do this again. This was a big mistake.
[07:45.240 --> 07:52.200]  So being able to take your time and be able to learn from your mistakes is great in any aspect
[07:52.200 --> 08:00.120]  of your life. I mean whether you're trying to grow or make hash or working at a restaurant.
[08:00.200 --> 08:03.000]  Whatever it may be. Whatever you do. If you can learn from your mistakes then hey
[08:03.880 --> 08:08.040]  you will always continue to get better. Which means you gotta keep trying. You gotta keep
[08:08.040 --> 08:12.360]  trying. You can't give up. Trust and believe. There's been many a times I've been thankful hard.
[08:13.080 --> 08:17.720]  I've shared some real tears but I've never got to the point to where I want to give up.
[08:17.720 --> 08:22.200]  So long as I can keep that fire and keep that going I will continue to stay in this industry
[08:22.200 --> 08:32.120]  and try to be relevant with it. That was the day it snowed like two feet outside in the night. So
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.640]  we got out there and made some snowmen. The reason we have Medicine Grower with Bullies is because
[08:37.640 --> 08:44.120]  I started out breeding American Bullies. I've got XL dogs. Pride and Joy. They're like my kids. I've
[08:44.200 --> 08:56.280]  got nine dogs. They are excellent in this. Being out here with me. They're good dogs to have.
[09:02.040 --> 09:08.280]  Sorry. Being great dogs. Sorry. So I've been breeding dogs for a while and I decided to
[09:08.280 --> 09:13.320]  incorporate that into my business. So I had a car detail business which was Terry's Car Detail. I've
[09:13.320 --> 09:19.240]  got Terry's Bullies. I've got Terry's Processing or Terry Hayes Collective. I'm trying to brand
[09:19.240 --> 09:24.200]  and put their name out there everywhere. That way people see that name. They may have an idea who I
[09:24.200 --> 09:33.080]  am or what it is that I do. I try to pride myself on keeping everything organic. All the way I feel
[09:33.080 --> 09:37.720]  like that is just the way to go. I mean if you can see in that picture right there those are raised
[09:37.720 --> 09:41.720]  beds. That was the first time we built that greenhouse. We tried to run it that way. Everything
[09:41.720 --> 09:48.600]  came out good. That soil right there is soil that I made. I just took a bunch of old school ways and
[09:48.600 --> 09:55.400]  did almost what would be like K&F farming except I did it with my soil. So I'll take a lot of
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.200]  cuttings of like old vegetables and stuff like that. Eating organic helps everything roll through
[10:02.200 --> 10:07.160]  the grow and the process of the well. So I take my organic food like the apples and oranges and
[10:07.160 --> 10:12.680]  tomato, lettuce, stuff like that. I'll take that and I'll compost all of it along with the roots,
[10:12.680 --> 10:19.800]  the stems, root balls and stuff like that. Unless I'm making a root ball tea with the K&F farming.
[10:19.800 --> 10:27.480]  So I'm just now new into the K&F farming with Van. You guys gotta check him out K&F Garden
[10:27.480 --> 10:33.880]  on Instagram. It's some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. I mean
[10:33.880 --> 10:41.000]  shout out to Van. He really really got me excited about growing again. For a while there I got kind
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.600]  of burned out and seeing his products just lit a fire under me to where I got heavy into the K&F
[10:48.600 --> 10:55.400]  farming realizing that it was basically what I do with my soil. And so incorporating that into my
[10:55.400 --> 11:02.760]  grow I'm starting to see amazing amazing products, amazing flower. Being able to
[11:04.040 --> 11:11.400]  work with this plant naturally and see how it does on its own without too much of man putting
[11:11.400 --> 11:16.600]  their hands into trying to make it grow. Man you can get beautiful plants, I mean beautiful medicine.
[11:16.600 --> 11:25.560]  I have a soil that I honestly do not give it anything other than humic acid and some aminos
[11:26.120 --> 11:30.360]  from the time they go into the raised beds up until about the second week of flower.
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.360]  Everything that my soil needs and everything that the plant needs is in that soil. I don't pH anything.
[11:37.720 --> 11:44.360]  I've got it now to where and I mean some strains may be different, some strains you may have to do
[11:44.360 --> 11:49.000]  a little extra work for, but for the most part the soil that I have is pretty general for just
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.800]  about everything. It's one of the deals like with K&F farming, I mean that stuff works with
[11:53.800 --> 11:58.280]  anything. I mean it's plants feeding plants. So it's the same thing that works in the soil. I've got
[11:59.080 --> 12:04.280]  it to where everything that plant needs is in that soil. So as long as I can water it and make
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.760]  it to where it's able to uptake all those nutrients that plant does what it does on its own. And it is
[12:08.760 --> 12:16.280]  made growing almost to the point to where it's like automatic. Especially I mean I'm literally
[12:16.280 --> 12:21.240]  out in the middle of the country guys. I'm watering with well water. I mean this water hasn't seen the sun
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.800]  and who knows when you know. So it's coming out of a hose and I'm watering my plants with it and you can
[12:25.800 --> 12:30.200]  see with the products. I mean a lot of people will probably disagree with it. A lot of people will say
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.760]  you know you may have this in your water, you may have that in your water, yada yada yada. I haven't
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.800]  had any problems with that. All of my stuff comes back and tests just fine. We test all the products.
[12:39.800 --> 12:47.240]  I wash all of my buds. I know people may think that's crazy but I actually do the process
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.920]  with the peroxide and baking soda and lignin and I do a three-stage process and I wash every bud that
[12:52.920 --> 12:59.480]  I grow. Outside, indoor, greenhouse, doesn't matter. I wash everything and it makes a huge huge difference.
[12:59.480 --> 13:04.600]  I mean a lot of times you can cut down a plant you know let it dry. You can try to smoke it you
[13:04.600 --> 13:09.000]  know to get a little taste of it and see what it's like and it's super harsh and you don't really have
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  the terpene profile and it's just not ready yet. You wash your buds I swear you can let them dry
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.080]  where it ain't good enough for you to smoke man and it's some of the smoothest tasting that you
[13:19.080 --> 13:25.080]  will be able to have that quick after a harvest. So any of you guys out there are thinking about
[13:25.080 --> 13:31.000]  doing a bug wash and try it. I guarantee you probably won't go back. You don't have to worry about
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.600]  losing too many trichomes and things like that. You don't have to worry about losing any potency
[13:36.600 --> 13:41.000]  or stuff like that. If you've got good dense buds a lot of your trichomes are already in the bug
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.200]  anyway so a little dip you know is not going to take away all your trichomes and it sure isn't
[13:46.200 --> 13:51.240]  going to lose any of your potency. So definitely guys if you are especially if you're growing
[13:51.240 --> 13:56.840]  outdoors I mean you got to think there's animals, there's birds, there's dust just dust in the air. I mean you
[13:56.840 --> 14:01.000]  walking by you know you maybe you know bring something on it that you probably just don't
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  want to smoke. You know skin cells hell just wash the bud you know it's totally worth it.
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.680]  It's a little bit of extra work but I guarantee it goes a long way and even before I wash you know
[14:10.680 --> 14:15.880]  for a hash I still wash my buds. So I think it's a good idea that if you're growing in
[14:16.680 --> 14:22.760]  really any type of conditions indoor or outdoor greenhouse whatever even in the tent just wash
[14:22.760 --> 14:29.320]  your buds. I mean we've got a lot of research out there that talks about bud washing so I just kind
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.680]  of wanted to hit on that because I've had a few people ask me about that process in the growing.
[14:35.560 --> 14:42.440]  So yeah wash the buds guys just worth it. I will say another thing too that people probably
[14:42.440 --> 14:47.960]  don't agree with. Like I say hey guys this is just this is me my opinion what I think you know
[14:47.960 --> 14:52.520]  don't take anything that I say as facts that that's what you should do and have to do it
[14:52.520 --> 14:58.520]  but just the way that I do things. So with that being said fresh frozen. I am not a fan of fresh
[14:58.520 --> 15:07.160]  frozen at all. I noticed a big new fad right now that everybody like oh it's fresh frozen it's live
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.720]  and blah blah blah blah blah. Well if you're doing any research you know with the growing and stuff
[15:11.720 --> 15:16.520]  like that I mean the whole reason that we cure our buds is for the more than anything is for the
[15:16.520 --> 15:22.600]  actual trichomes to cure. So whenever you cut the plant down and you go immediately to the freezer
[15:22.600 --> 15:29.000]  one your yield is incredibly incredibly lower than what it would be if you was allowed to dry
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.880]  for a little bit as well as you still get that green taste that you get from the chlorophyll and
[15:35.880 --> 15:40.360]  stuff like that being in that fresh frozen and I think a lot of that has to do with the trichome
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.600]  heads are not mature. You got to think your plant is producing these trichomes from the time that
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.640]  it starts growing. So during the day like when it's out in the sun those trichomes the oils and
[15:49.640 --> 15:53.880]  stuff like that they can start to evaporate. Every day it's going to produce new trichomes. So if you
[15:53.880 --> 15:58.360]  take that plant you cut it down and you freeze it you're going to have some immature trichomes
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.600]  regardless if you've got you know most of them are cloudy and stuff like that there's still a
[16:02.600 --> 16:09.800]  whole process into that that I don't I'm not 100% sure that we even quite understand what happens
[16:09.880 --> 16:16.440]  inside of that trichome head whenever that plant is no longer in the ground growing. There's a lot
[16:16.440 --> 16:22.920]  of different chemical processes I think that is going on during that cure and so I don't understand
[16:22.920 --> 16:29.880]  the point in stopping that to get this fresh frozen. I'm more looking for the medicinal effects.
[16:29.880 --> 16:36.760]  I don't care about the color. I don't a thousand percent care too much about the taste. I'm more
[16:36.760 --> 16:43.880]  worried about the effects. So I really really focus on the terpenes. So growing organically I've
[16:43.880 --> 16:49.720]  learned that I've been able to pull incredible amounts of terpenes out of my flower especially
[16:49.720 --> 16:56.120]  with bubble hash and ashtrawth and I want to believe that it is from the organic growing techniques.
[16:57.880 --> 17:05.400]  I've tried to do a couple of things to experiment. I at this point I think organic is still just the
[17:05.400 --> 17:13.640]  way to go. Fresh frozen is a thing that's each its own but me personally the trick to my trade is
[17:13.640 --> 17:18.520]  when I cut down my plants especially on my greenhouses that are you know 30-40 yards that way
[17:19.080 --> 17:23.880]  I'll let them dry and I'll let them dry for three four days something like that to where I can get
[17:23.880 --> 17:31.720]  me a jubilus loop or a microscope and look at the trichome heads and see the process of them
[17:32.440 --> 17:37.800]  maturing, curing. It's almost like wine. The longer you leave wine you know the better it is. Well if you're
[17:37.800 --> 17:41.800]  able to do that with the marijuana keeping it in the right condition you can get the same thing.
[17:41.800 --> 17:49.080]  And so allowing it to dry for you know three to four days and then immediately freezing it
[17:49.080 --> 17:52.440]  to me makes a big difference especially on a commercial level with the yield. I mean
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.640]  the yield can be three or four times as much with that with that little bit of dry time in there. So
[17:57.640 --> 18:01.400]  like I say each is all you want to do. Fresh frozen is how you do fresh frozen. That's your thing but I
[18:01.400 --> 18:07.000]  will say that I've been right now the way that I'm doing things with the six rosins that I did
[18:07.000 --> 18:14.760]  here just recently the lowest terpenes was 6.7 and then I get up to 14.78 terpenes and this again
[18:14.760 --> 18:19.080]  it's all organic this is solventless this is nothing but ice and water so therefore those
[18:19.080 --> 18:23.320]  terpenes were in that plant from the time that I cut it down all the way until I washed it. I didn't
[18:23.320 --> 18:29.320]  have to add anything to it so to be able to hit terpene levels like that I would have to say would
[18:29.320 --> 18:38.760]  be my process. I mean I took a grower out of still water and I did this on purpose. I didn't
[18:38.760 --> 18:42.680]  ask him his growing techniques. I didn't ask him if he was organic. I didn't ask him anything. I just
[18:42.680 --> 18:49.000]  really wanted a strain that he had a nerd strain to wash it and turn it into a rosin bait just to
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.040]  see if I could still get those same terpenes and so I did that and I actually hit 14.87 terpene.
[18:56.040 --> 19:01.320]  That's almost 15% terpenes in a rosin bait. I don't know about you guys I know I don't know a
[19:01.320 --> 19:06.600]  whole lot about the industry in that part but those are some pretty high numbers and I'll get to see
[19:06.600 --> 19:12.040]  that at least here in Oklahoma hitting 14% terpenes not once but twice that shows me there's consistency
[19:12.040 --> 19:17.960]  there so I've got a range of terpenes like I say the lowest was about six to eight percent terpenes
[19:17.960 --> 19:23.160]  and then I hit a 10.86 with the platinum vapor
[19:25.800 --> 19:31.640]  this was a strain that came from in-house genetics it was a grateful breath cross with a platinum man
[19:31.640 --> 19:35.320]  basically I did a phenol hunt got a really good strain out of it that came out
[19:36.840 --> 19:40.600]  oh I wish you guys could smell that I mean it hits you right in the face
[19:40.680 --> 19:48.120]  this one came out at 10.86 percent terpenes I've got a black cherry punch
[19:48.680 --> 19:55.880]  that came from in-house genetics as well 11.11 percent terpenes and like I say I'll focus on
[19:55.880 --> 20:04.760]  the terpene content all your strains unless it's a true CBD strain has THC and THC THCA
[20:04.760 --> 20:09.960]  they have those cannabinoids in it the difference is it becomes into terpenes and so when you're
[20:09.960 --> 20:14.920]  talking about terpenes and things like that that gets you to where you're getting the medicinal
[20:14.920 --> 20:21.000]  effects of the marijuana so I explained and I heard it from a guy shout out to Squeezer Palace
[20:21.000 --> 20:27.080]  if you guys have Instagram he explained it to me extremely well when you look at THC look thinking
[20:27.080 --> 20:32.920]  of it as a car THC THCA those cannabinoids that's your car your terpenes are your steering wheel
[20:32.920 --> 20:37.240]  and those will give you the direction of the high that you're going to get you know you're going to
[20:37.320 --> 20:41.800]  get up down the sativa or the indica whatever it may be those are all in your terpene so I focus
[20:41.800 --> 20:46.200]  mainly on the terpenes and the different type of terpenes and the amount of terpenes that's in there
[20:46.200 --> 20:53.080]  I mean you're talking about a gram of rosin but like with this one here the Platinum Vapor that
[20:53.080 --> 20:59.160]  we just did 79.62 percent total cannabinoids 10.9 percent terpene that terpene is where it's at
[21:00.120 --> 21:05.720]  so we've got those two then we did the uh the white blueberries white blueberries was a strain
[21:05.720 --> 21:12.600]  that I made it was a white widow male crossed with the huckleberry female both of those pictures
[21:12.600 --> 21:19.480]  are on my growth page you can check them out and see why I did that I ended up getting a hash rosin
[21:19.480 --> 21:29.000]  that looks like this so you can tell it's a little bit darker in color but the color to me
[21:29.960 --> 21:35.080]  doesn't matter in the sense of I mean yeah if you come out dark black yeah it may not be the best
[21:35.080 --> 21:40.520]  stuff but the flowers on this was dark dark purple I mean they were almost black I mean you
[21:40.520 --> 21:44.520]  showed a picture a little bit ago of the dark purple flowers on there the chalcones are darker so
[21:44.520 --> 21:49.960]  therefore the rosin is going to come out a little bit darker and so when people automatically look
[21:49.960 --> 21:56.280]  at it and judge it on color they miss the fact that this right here come out at 13.6 percent
[21:56.280 --> 22:04.920]  terpenes 13.6 with a TH the total cannabinoids 83.3 so if you are judging something
[22:05.240 --> 22:11.400]  on color man you're gonna miss out quite a bit on this I mean there's you can see that
[22:12.920 --> 22:19.720]  but the top four terpenes in there is the be careful in 5.25 percent and just that so out of
[22:19.720 --> 22:25.720]  the 13 terpenes in there five percent of that to be carefully we got pharmacy, limonene, mercine,
[22:26.520 --> 22:32.200]  humuline in there I put all of that on my products in my packaging that way I can have people to
[22:32.200 --> 22:36.360]  where they can actually study the terpenes and so if they smoke this rosin or smoke this flower
[22:36.360 --> 22:40.520]  they can look at those terpenes and be like okay I like this one I like the way that it made me feel
[22:40.520 --> 22:44.680]  or I didn't too much care for this it kind of made me jittery or whatever and then you can
[22:44.680 --> 22:53.000]  actually start to be able to dose yourself hey that's loud then you can be able to you know dose
[22:53.000 --> 23:00.440]  yourself on the terpenes I just graduated from Regina Nelson's class to be a certified clinician
[23:00.840 --> 23:05.880]  basically what that does is makes it to where I'm actually certified through the ECS
[23:05.880 --> 23:13.400]  program to be able to dose patients and to be able to teach classes and sell the books and
[23:13.400 --> 23:18.280]  stuff like that to be able to teach people more about these products because being on a commercial
[23:18.280 --> 23:25.320]  level I have the biggest problem that I'm going against million-dollar companies who are taking
[23:25.320 --> 23:29.080]  product and making things like you know like distillating waxes and you know using routine
[23:29.400 --> 23:33.880]  retaining co2 extractions and when you're doing things like that man your yield is going to be
[23:33.880 --> 23:39.560]  two three four times as much as it is with mine but mine is organic and to me personally I feel
[23:39.560 --> 23:46.280]  like you have a 100 organic body if you want to take care of it and give it what it needs then
[23:46.280 --> 23:52.360]  you should go organic I mean our bodies have an entire endocannabinoid system made specifically
[23:52.360 --> 23:58.200]  for these cannabinoids so it's one of those deals to where as long as you keep that system
[23:58.200 --> 24:03.080]  fed and what it is that it needs it can help heal your body can help you heal you with the anxiety
[24:03.080 --> 24:07.400]  stomach issues you know it's good for cancer patients I mean everybody knows there's a
[24:07.400 --> 24:13.480]  whole lot of medicinal product properties in the marijuana so I feel like if we can keep it to where
[24:13.480 --> 24:20.120]  we are going organic and keeping things true to itself I feel like it's going to work out better
[24:20.120 --> 24:25.640]  like again now I'm not knocking what anybody does you just let co2 people do your thing I ain't mad
[24:25.640 --> 24:31.000]  at you hey everybody started somewhere and that's where I started at I did my thing with that but
[24:31.960 --> 24:36.520]  I just feel like now you know I'd rather do solventless the taste is there the effects is
[24:36.520 --> 24:42.440]  there I don't have to smoke a whole lot of it to get the the medicinal effects it is that I need
[24:42.440 --> 24:48.200]  and I ain't gonna lie to you it's fun it's a lot of fun to sit back and make bubble hash to take a product
[24:48.920 --> 24:55.320]  and give people the essence of it like I said before the future cannabis project earlier
[24:55.320 --> 25:02.360]  it's um I explain people taking the bubble hashes you think about an apple tree and with this apple
[25:02.360 --> 25:08.520]  tree I get rid of the roots the bark the stems the leaves get rid of the the apple the seeds
[25:08.520 --> 25:13.000]  everything in and I give you the juice so I take the entire apple tree and I give you the juice
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  essentially the same thing with the hash rosin I take that entire plant get rid of the stems and
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.200]  the fan leaves and all of that stuff and I'm taking the chalcon heads and squeezing them out
[25:24.200 --> 25:28.440]  and I'm giving you the juice out of that plant that's the essence of the plant terpenes are there
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.320]  cannabinoids are there everything is there and I don't have to use a single chemical to get that
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.840]  so I can take that and put that into my organic natural body that turns into dust whenever I
[25:38.840 --> 25:45.240]  stop breathing and be able to heal myself I practice that in the foods that I eat things
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.600]  like that so that's just my personal opinion on being organic staying organic staying true to
[25:50.600 --> 25:55.880]  that plant I don't have to worry about any extra problems that I may run into by trying to
[25:55.880 --> 26:03.320]  manipulate the plant a little bit too much so doing it that way I um I like it I've been pretty
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.960]  successful with I'm getting great numbers I'm getting great effects I'm getting a lot of people
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.440]  who are really really starting to like my products like the way that I'm doing things like the whole
[26:12.440 --> 26:16.840]  idea of keeping it organic so I don't plan on stopping I'm gonna keep doing it that way you
[26:16.840 --> 26:22.280]  know so to each his own but that's pretty much the way it is that I do with uh with the girl
[26:22.280 --> 26:28.920]  all organic no pesticides chemical free um good organic medicine
[26:30.920 --> 26:36.040]  um so you know there was some there was a girl that came from out of town and she actually asked
[26:36.040 --> 26:39.880]  you a question when you were on stage and she was talking about how light your product was and she
[26:39.880 --> 26:46.120]  was asking you like some of those reasons why um because of your view on not going fresh frozen so
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.600]  I actually had that in my notes to talk with you on that and hopefully even go deeper now that I
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.960]  see Layton just popped up but I do say that like you know you were gracious when I was out there
[26:55.960 --> 27:01.720]  and let me smoke I was able to hit that pin like literally on the other side and just you know
[27:02.280 --> 27:07.720]  listening to you uh kind of break it down for people that's what that's what I really like
[27:07.720 --> 27:11.640]  about people that are self-educated that's another thing that I love about having Layton on the show
[27:12.040 --> 27:18.040]  uh is just being able to break stuff down for the layman I feel like it's just an art form because
[27:18.040 --> 27:24.440]  a lot of us um have to re-rethink sometimes a couple times or uh just a you know this day and
[27:24.440 --> 27:30.040]  age it's more like YouTube videos so uh Layton if you're ready to go buddy uh appreciate you
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.360]  going out there and being a real trooper man throwing court uh throwing touchdowns in the
[27:34.360 --> 27:41.160]  in the fourth quarter. Well it's good to be back I missed you all last week uh that was
[27:41.160 --> 27:46.840]  really weird not being here on Thursdays and uh nice to meet you brother um you know I have I have
[27:46.840 --> 27:52.360]  a question for you um I've got this guy that's been hitting me up about trying to uh convert his
[27:52.360 --> 28:00.520]  flower into um a pen and so maybe you could uh you know explain the process a little bit for us
[28:00.520 --> 28:06.200]  uh for this listener um he's in a you know he's in lockdown he's in a in a state where um it's
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.960]  illegal and so he can't get a lot of information out and so maybe you could uh do a quick uh session
[28:11.960 --> 28:19.160]  on that. Yeah so the vapes right now are starting to become a big thing especially since we've had
[28:19.160 --> 28:23.160]  so many problems with the other dissolute vapes and adenoturphine and stuff like that
[28:23.160 --> 28:30.280]  so people don't know what that means basically you do a extraction use of CO2 and butane
[28:30.280 --> 28:37.240]  and whenever you do something like that you are basically ripping the plant of all this terpenes
[28:37.240 --> 28:41.320]  which like I say that's the medicinal product in it so then what happens is these companies have to
[28:41.320 --> 28:46.840]  go and they have to get terpenes from outside places that may or may not be natural or may or
[28:46.840 --> 28:50.840]  may not be derived from cannabis and they put that in the dissolute to give you a taste to give you
[28:50.840 --> 28:57.240]  the idea that you are getting those terpenes well you may be but the way that I explain that to
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.520]  people to get them to understand is okay if you think of a water molecule you're talking H2O
[29:02.520 --> 29:07.720]  well if I take H2O and I split it then I have oxygen that can be a poisonous gas and that can
[29:07.720 --> 29:12.280]  kill you same thing with with hydrogen if you separate you got hydrogen you got a hydrogen bomb
[29:12.280 --> 29:15.560]  that can kill a lot of people but if you put it together you've got water and that's the elixir
[29:15.560 --> 29:21.240]  of life everybody needs water everything needs water so I like to keep everything together so
[29:21.240 --> 29:27.080]  when you're talking about taking that plant and condensing it down and concentrating it into a pen
[29:27.160 --> 29:33.560]  I take the bubble hash after I take them freeze and everything turn it and get my bubble hash dry
[29:33.560 --> 29:39.160]  it after I dry the bubble hash I'll take it and I'll press it on my rosin press and then I'll allow
[29:39.160 --> 29:45.080]  that to cure and once it cures and it butters up and it gets to the consistency that's normal for
[29:45.080 --> 29:50.840]  like hash rosin which would be you know something like this here then you can take and do what's
[29:50.840 --> 29:58.280]  like a basically a jar tech with really low temperatures and you aren't necessarily
[29:58.280 --> 30:06.200]  decarbonating you are changing a few cannabinoids that will actually transition into another
[30:06.200 --> 30:12.920]  cannabinoid I've been able to see that with my test results about how my hash rosin converts into
[30:12.920 --> 30:21.880]  my rosin vapes you will lose about 0.1 0.2 percent terpenes on there you know not a lot
[30:21.880 --> 30:26.680]  not a lot that you would you know see a big difference on but essentially it's second
[30:26.680 --> 30:33.000]  product actually looks like this this is a platinum vapor that I pressed a few days ago
[30:33.640 --> 30:36.440]  check out to the harvest fest it buttered up
[30:39.800 --> 30:48.280]  so we've got something that has this consistency here and we take and we do a jar tech process
[30:48.280 --> 30:55.960]  keeping it sealed and we're able to get something that essentially you hear that jar crack looks
[30:55.960 --> 31:01.400]  like this and you can tell I mean there's quite a bit of product off in there but you can tell
[31:01.400 --> 31:05.880]  see you see through you can still see through that so this right here is a vape juice that I
[31:05.880 --> 31:14.840]  would take and put into vapes and there you go no chemicals no extra steps anything like that I'm
[31:14.840 --> 31:18.920]  pretty much taking the rosin and then melting it down and putting it in the pan for you still
[31:18.920 --> 31:24.360]  getting a rosin vape every time a rosin hit every time you hit one of the vapes so it's honestly
[31:24.360 --> 31:29.400]  not a crazy huge process my biggest thing is I'm able to capture the terpenes and that's the
[31:29.960 --> 31:33.880]  to me one of the most important parts of the entire plant is those terpenes that we get no
[31:33.880 --> 31:39.400]  other plant has that many terpenes at that those kind of levels I mean there's terpenes in all
[31:39.400 --> 31:47.080]  kinds of other plants obviously but not like that in marijuana so I hate that he's in lockdown like
[31:47.080 --> 31:54.680]  that but if he can get into making the bubble highs making the rosin getting to cure up at that
[31:54.680 --> 32:01.320]  point you pretty much got it made so this uh the the bottle tech is your what temperature are you
[32:01.320 --> 32:05.800]  warming um the rosin up to after you um it really depends on the strain I mean you're somewhere
[32:05.800 --> 32:13.240]  between 150 180 um some people do it at a higher temperature you just kind of got to play around
[32:13.240 --> 32:18.520]  with it and just wait for it to get to the consistency that you want I mean there's a lot
[32:18.520 --> 32:23.480]  of different deals that can affect it I mean a lot of people use jar tip to try to make solventless
[32:23.480 --> 32:30.440]  diamonds in there and you can do it that way um it's just kind of dependent on the time that you
[32:30.440 --> 32:34.520]  have off in there depending on the temperature that you would have to play around with with
[32:34.520 --> 32:39.320]  every strain I mean I've had some strains to where the temperature may be a little bit too warm and
[32:39.320 --> 32:43.400]  it quickly did it was supposed to but it didn't taste the same way so you really got to kind of
[32:43.400 --> 32:47.800]  play around with a little bit of time um pay attention to your press the temperature that
[32:47.800 --> 32:52.280]  you press it up will help you be able to determine what temperature that you should put it in your
[32:52.280 --> 32:56.520]  oven as well as paying attention to you know not to get it too hot to actually decarve it all
[32:59.080 --> 33:05.240]  so once you're done that process you really you didn't add anything but it stayed in suspension
[33:05.240 --> 33:10.920]  because you know sometimes pens plug up because it just it reeks I don't know gets hard again
[33:10.920 --> 33:18.440]  in the in the fake car yeah I've noticed that I tell people um it's good to make sure you keep
[33:18.440 --> 33:23.400]  a rosin pen straight up and down don't leave it in your car I mean it's hot outside you leave it
[33:23.400 --> 33:29.160]  in the car you're probably going to destroy a lot of stuff in it as well as destroy it um doing that
[33:29.160 --> 33:35.640]  preheat setting on your pens uh helps out a lot and then the type of vapes that you're using that's
[33:35.640 --> 33:39.720]  one thing I've noticed with commercially I mean when I'm buying vape carts hell I'm buying 5,000
[33:39.720 --> 33:46.280]  vape carts you know I can't guarantee you that one of them may not work you know one may plug up
[33:46.280 --> 33:50.600]  you know sometimes it just happens it's not necessarily anything wrong with the product it's
[33:50.600 --> 33:56.760]  just I had to buy you know something from overseas that may not have been the best but
[33:57.800 --> 34:04.440]  if you can get that consistency down to where it's almost a water liquid type um that will
[34:04.440 --> 34:10.280]  help you out a whole lot for any type of plugging up stuff like that high terpenes in it actually
[34:10.280 --> 34:17.080]  help out as well because terpenes almost they basically almost act like a solvent to the TACA
[34:17.080 --> 34:22.440]  so whenever I'm making something like solventless diamonds using the press which is like repressing
[34:22.440 --> 34:29.560]  the the rosin I have noticed that the terpene levels that are extremely hot makes it really
[34:29.560 --> 34:35.160]  hard to be able to separate those terpenes from the TACA so that led me to believe that when you
[34:35.160 --> 34:40.760]  have high terpenes in like one of your rosin carts the fact that there are a lot of terpenes
[34:40.760 --> 34:47.320]  in there helps keep it at that state that you want to keep it in. I noticed too even with some of your
[34:47.320 --> 34:53.880]  stuff while I was out there the the strength of the battery seems to to really matter when you're
[34:53.880 --> 34:58.040]  you know mobile and that kind of stuff because if you do buy one of those cheaper ones it seems like
[34:58.680 --> 35:03.720]  maybe 10, 15 you know pulls is really what's hitting and then it doesn't really work out
[35:03.720 --> 35:08.440]  where you invest in I think they're like 30 bucks or something they're a little bit more but
[35:09.320 --> 35:13.720]  you know those those seem to really just power through that rosin which I feel like a lot of
[35:13.720 --> 35:18.760]  people that's the biggest gripe with that kind of stuff is that the soccer mom weed if you will
[35:18.760 --> 35:24.440]  clogs up and people you know feel like it's kind of wasted on the pen I feel like that's what
[35:24.440 --> 35:29.800]  Layton was kind of getting to as well and one of the main reasons I feel like that is it's usually
[35:30.200 --> 35:37.880]  a really weak battery. Yeah I think so the battery definitely has a lot to do with it I mean if you
[35:37.880 --> 35:42.840]  got a stronger battery it helps out I mean you gotta think you're like basically in a sense
[35:42.840 --> 35:47.240]  you're taking a dab of rosin so you mean you know how hot you have to get your temperatures up to
[35:47.240 --> 35:51.640]  hit a good I mean even a cold start dab so you're talking about using a battery to heat it up that
[35:51.640 --> 35:57.480]  much so I've got on my cars we have a ceramic coil it's been a really hard time especially here in
[35:57.480 --> 36:03.080]  Oklahoma because we don't have places like out in California and Oregon to be able to go pick up
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.880]  products like this everything we get we have to order it and with our different laws and stuff
[36:07.880 --> 36:15.000]  here it has become extremely hard to get some of the actual packaging and stuff like that that we
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.680]  need there's been several times I've called packaging companies and tell them I'm from
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.480]  Oklahoma you can hear them going oh you're from Oklahoma like you know what I mean so we're still
[36:23.480 --> 36:28.280]  working on stuff like that but I've been doing research and hey if anybody out there got a good
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.000]  idea on you know a good vape cart that will work for the rosin hey let me know and I'm always looking
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.560]  for something better you know but right now we're not having too many problems I think like you say
[36:37.560 --> 36:44.440]  the battery and then the actual type of vape cart you use I believe ceramic is the way to go you get
[36:44.440 --> 36:50.840]  a totally different taste when you're when you're smoking rosin off of any type of metal ceramic I
[36:50.840 --> 36:58.600]  think ceramic or glass is the way to go so we can can we get into that recipe a little bit more like
[36:59.240 --> 37:06.040]  can you just go slow from start to end so you first you wash it then you're pressing it at what temps
[37:07.320 --> 37:12.280]  that again is all depends on the strength whenever I'm whenever I've got a big batch of bubble hash
[37:12.280 --> 37:16.040]  I'll take a few grams and do a couple of test presses and figure out what temperature you want
[37:16.040 --> 37:22.520]  to be some people like to press hot and fast and so they'll get temperature you know 180 you know
[37:22.520 --> 37:27.160]  200 210 and they're throwing the bubble hash on they're pressing and getting it off the press as
[37:27.160 --> 37:31.880]  quick as they can and running with running with it that way you've got people who will go at about
[37:31.880 --> 37:38.360]  the middle route um with their temperatures to try to get more of a yield and a prettier color
[37:38.360 --> 37:43.240]  and then you've got some people that go super super low temperatures they're barely melting
[37:43.480 --> 37:49.080]  squeezing it out the bag it kind of decreases your yield a little bit but those temperatures
[37:49.080 --> 37:52.760]  and things like that like people ask a lot of time you know what temperature you're at
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.560]  all of that depends on the humidity that day it depends on the temperature that your room is in
[37:57.560 --> 38:02.920]  like right now I've got a mini split going right now and I can get it uh cold as I've got it's 48
[38:02.920 --> 38:06.680]  degrees in this building it's not a huge building but I can get it pretty cold in there but all of
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.160]  those things all depend on the temperatures and stuff like that that you're going to
[38:11.960 --> 38:16.920]  be able to press that um the quality of the bubble hash I mean if I can take bubble hash
[38:16.920 --> 38:20.760]  and I can just squeeze it in between my fingers and I can get it to melt and get it to
[38:21.400 --> 38:25.080]  stick together then I know that's good high quality bubble hash there if I've got some
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.760]  stuff that's like I sifted and it's like dust and it goes up in there with it yeah you don't have
[38:30.760 --> 38:35.720]  that's not your product all your all your good essential oils are gone so those temperatures
[38:35.720 --> 38:41.400]  already kind of depend on like I say relative humidity uh the type of product how cold your
[38:41.400 --> 38:46.840]  room is what type of batch you're pressing in what type of press you're using but on average
[38:46.840 --> 38:50.520]  I mean you can go anywhere from 160 to 200 just depending on how you're pressing
[38:53.800 --> 39:00.360]  so really is strain or cultivar specific it's uh it's not an easy one so I guess to the audience
[39:00.760 --> 39:06.280]  is you really should be playing small scale with after you've sifted it to find out what it's how
[39:06.280 --> 39:15.720]  it's going to react yes um I will look at my product under a microscope the entire process
[39:15.720 --> 39:21.000]  like while I am right before I harvest it I'm looking at the trichomes under a microscope
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.640]  I keep mine I keep mine cold all the way up to the point to where it's like
[39:28.440 --> 39:33.560]  buttered up ready to go depending on the type of cure that I do so keeping those temperatures cold
[39:33.560 --> 39:38.360]  is I think it's helping preserve a lot of the terpenes and the cannabinoids that's in there
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.160]  that's why I'm able to get those higher numbers I think this with my process I keep everything
[39:43.160 --> 39:50.440]  quick I keep everything super super cold um my water whenever I'm washing a machine I have a good
[39:50.440 --> 39:57.640]  equal or not equal but I have a good setup on the ratio between water and ash rosin and that's
[39:57.640 --> 40:03.720]  one thing I really did learn from Fritzi Canoli was the temperature of your water is extremely
[40:03.720 --> 40:08.200]  important and the temperature of your water is not dependent on how much ice you have in there
[40:08.200 --> 40:13.640]  it's actually dependent on the rate of the ice melting that is what gets you that actual cold
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.480]  temperature so if you've got a washer or you're doing it by hand and you're full of a whole bunch
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.120]  of ice a little bit of water you don't have enough room for it to move around and you don't have it
[40:22.120 --> 40:27.160]  to where the ice is melting at a constant rate to be able to keep that temperature cold I'm able to
[40:27.160 --> 40:32.040]  get my temperatures in my water down to 27 degrees and it's still a liquid so if you are able to
[40:33.400 --> 40:37.400]  get your ratio down for your machine or what it is that you're doing to be able to get temperatures
[40:37.400 --> 40:43.000]  down like that it will make a huge difference so you're right I mean you can read all the books
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.400]  that you want to you can watch all the videos that you want but until you actually get out there and
[40:47.880 --> 40:52.600]  get your hands on it and watch it and see it and see it coming off the press and go through the
[40:52.600 --> 40:57.480]  whole step you're just kind of window shopping just kind of looking you got to get out there
[40:57.480 --> 41:02.200]  and try it you got to take those risks of taking that two or three pounds and washing it and hoping
[41:02.200 --> 41:07.000]  that you get something that's just what you got to do and that's the biggest thing I think that
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.080]  holds people back and I hope that that's the reason why you know they're turning in to listen
[41:11.080 --> 41:16.440]  to you today is because a lot of the mistakes especially just even a few years ago were
[41:16.440 --> 41:23.000]  causing you know issues between long-time friends because there would be a lot of stuff that was
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.480]  being grown and then blow out or something where you're trying to figure stuff out or
[41:27.480 --> 41:32.360]  like you had mentioned color you know I feel like especially at the beginning of this I feel like
[41:32.360 --> 41:35.880]  more and more people are starting to understand what you had mentioned but especially at the
[41:35.880 --> 41:41.240]  beginning color was everything and I feel like a lot of people were deceived especially in the kind
[41:41.240 --> 41:48.360]  of gray world of things I don't think anybody really knew what CRC was until later on when you
[41:48.360 --> 41:54.040]  would get kind of had you know those were the we thought like the beasters of the of the dab world
[41:54.040 --> 42:00.520]  so as it's progressed I feel like you know terpenes is really where that that is where the
[42:00.520 --> 42:06.280]  market is going I the the real I feel like connoisseur customer they just want to be able to
[42:06.280 --> 42:11.880]  taste the medicine enjoy the flavors like you had mentioned and I know that you're probably going to
[42:11.880 --> 42:17.880]  get a lot of opposition with the fresh frozen thing so that's what I like about you man is you
[42:17.880 --> 42:24.360]  just hey you're in this corner someone's in the other corner I know Layton has definitely stances
[42:24.360 --> 42:27.880]  on that I know I have my own personal stances on a lot of things where it's just like hey this is
[42:27.880 --> 42:33.000]  how I truly feel about something here I know a lot of people don't agree with that but what I like
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.240]  is that you're the fact that you're self-taught man is I feel like you can kind of be in whatever
[42:37.240 --> 42:41.320]  lane you feel like is working out through your experience and I don't think a lot of people really
[42:42.040 --> 42:47.400]  take the time to you know like you mentioned Frenchie Cannoli like at first you know some
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.520]  of these like I feel like younger gentlemen were all of a sudden really good at certain things and
[42:52.520 --> 42:58.600]  thought like you know his process and that kind of stuff was dated and kind of just very disrespectful
[42:58.680 --> 43:04.040]  I honestly felt like that's the best word to use for it when they don't really understand everything
[43:04.040 --> 43:10.200]  and taking the time to to see what what he's really saying and in a way like he's kind of
[43:10.200 --> 43:16.920]  like a philosopher of look there's there's a lot of different ways to take this to the next level
[43:16.920 --> 43:22.360]  I felt like instead of just there's a lot of cookie cutter everybody's using the same genetics
[43:23.160 --> 43:27.080]  so that's something that I you know you're focused on in-house genetics I've heard you
[43:27.080 --> 43:32.600]  mentioned several times I think you you've even done some work with the on the on your own with
[43:32.600 --> 43:39.320]  that white blueberries if I'm correct yeah I actually the white blueberries was from the bank
[43:39.320 --> 43:45.160]  genetics is where the huckleberry came from and actually the white widow came from canuck seeds
[43:45.160 --> 43:48.840]  this is when I first started out and actually it must have been a feminine seed and it came out it
[43:48.840 --> 43:53.480]  was a male so I had a room full of white widow and I had one plant in the corner that was just
[43:53.640 --> 43:57.640]  foot tall than all the rest of the plants and I'm looking like okay that was really doing this thing
[43:58.200 --> 44:02.120]  come in one day and this balls all over I'm like all right that's the metal what can we do with
[44:02.120 --> 44:08.200]  that you know so I um I've used uh in-house genetics one thing that I've learned though
[44:08.200 --> 44:13.240]  about this and this is kind of again one of those deals to where it's like nobody's really going to
[44:13.240 --> 44:17.400]  tell you this you kind of got to figure out on your own you're buying seeds from these seed banks
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.480]  I'm gonna tell you right now you're doing a pheno hunt that's what you're doing you may get it out
[44:21.480 --> 44:25.480]  what it looks like that you bought the picture or whatever you're still essentially doing the
[44:25.480 --> 44:32.840]  pheno hunt so that's why I personally have for the most part stopped buying seeds um I have a
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.400]  whole catalog of a lot of seeds that I've gotten from over the years and stuff and right now I'm
[44:37.400 --> 44:42.760]  just focused on breeding my own because then I can get that pheno that I want and like the
[44:42.760 --> 44:49.640]  white blueberries and be able to grow that plant I'm growing indoors outdoors growing it in tent
[44:49.640 --> 44:53.880]  I've grown in the greenhouse to be able to work on you know different conditions and different
[44:53.880 --> 44:59.640]  nutrients that it may need in those different conditions you know so the whole seed game is
[44:59.640 --> 45:04.920]  awesome and I think it's amazing that we're able to get these seeds out for people to be able to
[45:04.920 --> 45:11.640]  grow and experiment but I think as a grower me personally your goal ought to be yeah to grow
[45:11.640 --> 45:17.640]  good stuff but really grow your own like grow your own strains find your find the new strain that's
[45:17.640 --> 45:23.560]  got a new terpene that we hardly ever see or a higher cannabinoid that we hardly ever see you
[45:23.560 --> 45:27.800]  know something like that let's like like you're showing the whole cookie quarter I don't want to
[45:27.800 --> 45:33.240]  do the same thing that everybody else is doing so I've got a lot of black because people look at me
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.920]  like I have a huge ego and I tell people all the time it's not an ego to just I would rather teach
[45:38.920 --> 45:46.440]  myself the way that I do it so I haven't taken a lot of time to watch every single French cannoli
[45:46.440 --> 45:52.040]  and watch every single you know hash maker out here and how they're doing it and stuff like that
[45:52.040 --> 45:58.040]  I actually didn't listen so I could figure some of it out on my own and then go back and watch
[45:58.040 --> 46:02.200]  French cannoli and be like yep that's the same choice that I made and I understand why you made
[46:02.200 --> 46:07.400]  that choice or yes I understand why you did this because that same thing happened to me one time
[46:07.400 --> 46:12.360]  so I made his videos and stuff like that a hell of a lot more educational because I had a background
[46:12.440 --> 46:16.360]  you get a lot of people that's trying to start school in the fifth grade and they missed the
[46:16.360 --> 46:21.000]  first second and third and so therefore they jump in and they're like well I want to do it this way
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  and blah blah blah so and so did it this way and they have no idea why they're just following along
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.880]  with somebody told them to do so again you got to get out there and start doing it on your own I
[46:29.880 --> 46:35.320]  mean do all the research that you can do but definitely like put your hands on it to figure
[46:35.320 --> 46:40.280]  out why people may do it that way even with the fresh frozen I don't like fresh frozen because
[46:40.280 --> 46:43.960]  I don't necessarily care for the taste and I don't care for the yield and you don't ain't that
[46:43.960 --> 46:49.400]  for me so I don't want to do it it's fun I mean you can say oh yeah I cut it down I mean I've done
[46:49.400 --> 46:55.480]  it before I've cut down the plant washed it got it out the dry pressed it all within probably 36
[46:55.480 --> 47:00.680]  hours I've got it done ain't that big of a difference from a plant that I'll let cure for
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.880]  three or four days other than it got a better taste it's got a better high than the terpene
[47:06.760 --> 47:13.320]  better so I mean to each his own and that's that sweet spot for you in Oklahoma is is three to four
[47:13.320 --> 47:21.480]  days yep and that's a good point you said in Oklahoma too right that's what I wanted to kind
[47:21.480 --> 47:27.960]  of get into so yes yeah these are like uh you know you come in you're a pilot you got to dial in
[47:27.960 --> 47:33.880]  everything every time you're kind of setting up in a new uh new spot or new state kind of thing
[47:33.880 --> 47:39.400]  and I think that's um a lot of people didn't realize that at the beginning or or maybe just
[47:39.400 --> 47:44.280]  didn't really realize the importance of it at the beginning yeah yeah there's still a lot of stuff
[47:44.280 --> 47:50.200]  that we don't know I mean like just general relatively temperatures here I like to say I'm
[47:50.200 --> 47:55.080]  out in the middle of the country I probably got I don't know 25 people in a square five square like
[47:55.080 --> 48:00.680]  five square mile radius so I'm out here you know and I can tell you one thing like during the
[48:00.680 --> 48:06.440]  winter time if it's cold outside so much colder in the country so much colder in the country than
[48:06.440 --> 48:11.560]  it is in the city same thing with summertime summertime when it's hot in the city yes it's
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.160]  a little warm you know you may be getting temperatures 80 90 100 degrees in the city
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.600]  and you come out in the country bro you talking about 100 110 you talking about greenhouses that
[48:20.600 --> 48:27.240]  approaching you know crazy crazy numbers in heat you know so all of that depends I mean from state
[48:27.240 --> 48:31.960]  to state you know from different parts of the state I'm from the east side of Oklahoma the
[48:31.960 --> 48:36.200]  weather over there is completely different than it is over here the rain is different hell all the
[48:36.200 --> 48:42.760]  people are different you know so all of those factors come in in the play whenever you're
[48:43.480 --> 48:47.080]  growing making hash whatever it is that you're doing with this like all of that stuff comes
[48:47.080 --> 48:54.120]  into play and if you are able to take time and to be able to pinpoint each one of those variations
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.840]  you can come up with a good process but you're just gonna have to do the work
[48:58.440 --> 49:02.120]  every season is going to be different it's basically what you're saying every girl is
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.920]  different um so let me ask you this let's dial in on the microscope when you when you're
[49:06.920 --> 49:13.720]  microscoping what are you looking for you looking for color clarity cloudiness yeah all of those
[49:13.720 --> 49:17.400]  things so when I'm looking like especially when I'm getting ready to harvest so like say I'm going
[49:17.400 --> 49:21.800]  out and I've got my laptop microscope and I'm looking out at uh the harvest and getting ready
[49:21.800 --> 49:28.840]  to harvest something I'm looking at the trichomes in the sense of yes what color they are um cloudy
[49:28.840 --> 49:34.040]  clear amber how much of it is amber I'm paying attention to all of that I like to get
[49:36.120 --> 49:40.680]  50 percent amber and that's one thing that's different about mine so I'm able to cure for
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.920]  those three days because I'm not cutting it down when 70 80 percent of it is all amber
[49:44.920 --> 49:49.320]  I'm cutting it down maybe about 50 percent and then I'm giving it a chance to be able to
[49:49.320 --> 49:55.480]  cure on his own without the different effects of the water and light and sun and all that stuff
[49:55.480 --> 49:58.760]  you know why the plant is still growing it's actually curing on his own like I say like kind
[49:58.760 --> 50:05.640]  of like why so I'm looking at a lot of different things the colors I'm looking at the size of the
[50:05.640 --> 50:11.240]  trichome head I'm looking at the length of the stem how long it is how short it is I'm going all
[50:11.240 --> 50:16.760]  the way down and I'm looking at the point to where you have the trichome head and the stem I'm looking
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.400]  at that point right there where they meet to be able to tell you know would this be a trichome
[50:21.400 --> 50:26.600]  head that will fall off very easily or is it so connected that I'm probably going to put a lot of
[50:26.600 --> 50:31.480]  stems with it as well and so whenever you're trying to make bubble house you want just the
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.800]  head you don't really want the stems in there that changes colors and things like that it does have
[50:35.800 --> 50:41.480]  some um medicinal properties in the stem but your goal is to get the heads so whenever I'm out there
[50:41.480 --> 50:46.600]  with a microscope I'm paying attention to all of that more importantly it's the the size and the
[50:46.680 --> 50:55.800]  shape and the actual structure of the trichome that will give me a good idea of what is going
[50:55.800 --> 51:00.520]  to come out like in the wash as long as things like you know a jar test you know with ice with
[51:00.520 --> 51:06.040]  a mason jar doing stuff like that but like you said before I mean there's some strains out there
[51:06.040 --> 51:13.000]  that I've looked at that I've grown covered with trichome I mean look like somebody sprinkled some
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.600]  fairy dust on it you know throw it in the washer you can get shit you can get shit it's very
[51:18.600 --> 51:24.760]  disappointing you know so all of that all of that stuff factors in and that's one of those deals to
[51:24.760 --> 51:29.720]  where you know as a grower as a processor like you're going to have to look at your methods on
[51:29.720 --> 51:36.040]  how you do things and then how that coincides with the products that you were able to get your hands
[51:36.600 --> 51:44.600]  so if you got products that got real long legs on the stem and real small heads on it you know
[51:44.600 --> 51:51.720]  you got to be able to work out in your own thing I will tell people that one you'll never beat the
[51:51.720 --> 51:56.200]  sun I don't care what kind of growing light that you have I don't care what million dollar company
[51:56.200 --> 52:03.160]  made your life you'll never beat the sun so the size of the trichome the heads and stuff like that
[52:03.160 --> 52:09.160]  you'll never be sunburned I've noticed that a lot of leds will give you a lot of trichome
[52:09.160 --> 52:13.960]  but they're extremely small heads the the size of the head and the stem is almost the same size
[52:13.960 --> 52:20.280]  therefore that's not good for washing so growing techniques like looking lights and stuff like that
[52:20.280 --> 52:31.000]  all of that matters you know Frenchy once told me that he he sees there's only a window about three
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.600]  days for him to harvest he said sometimes five depending on the cultivar do you feel the same
[52:36.600 --> 52:42.040]  is true in in your techniques and methods that you have a very small window whenever you're getting
[52:42.040 --> 52:49.400]  ready to harvest I mean it's two days before I'm thinking that I may be three days away from a
[52:49.400 --> 52:53.400]  harvest I'm starting to get prepared and I'm coming out there and I'm looking at the plants
[52:53.400 --> 52:58.360]  and I'm not looking at just one plant I'm going through looking at each base seeing an average of
[52:58.360 --> 53:06.920]  where the plants are the amount of trichomes the the size of the trichome the color the size of the
[53:06.920 --> 53:11.880]  actual heads on there all of that changes they can change quite a bit within days which is the
[53:11.880 --> 53:15.960]  whole deal with like drying it for a day or two that first day of drying compared to the third
[53:15.960 --> 53:21.160]  fourth or seven days of drying yeah man there's a whole lot of things that go on so yeah I agree
[53:21.160 --> 53:27.400]  with them I mean I think it is you know a real fine line to where if you're a day late you may
[53:27.400 --> 53:31.720]  be a day late and a dollar short if you wait too long so same thing with you going too early you
[53:31.720 --> 53:36.120]  go too early you may not get those terpene content you may not get that medicinal stuff you may not
[53:36.120 --> 53:41.960]  get that yield you may not you know all of that goes into there you know another thing that hasn't
[53:41.960 --> 53:45.960]  been mentioned is that there are really good plants for washing and then there are horrible
[53:45.960 --> 53:52.440]  ones for washing and you know I think that that also is a real big factor is that if you might
[53:52.440 --> 53:57.800]  have a beautiful plant and wash and get nothing you know nothing yeah ganja gill talks about that
[53:57.800 --> 54:03.720]  he's like he's totally into his cultivars so if your if your goal is to make pens or to wash you
[54:03.720 --> 54:08.680]  better you better know your genetics really freaking well yes yes which is why I think that
[54:08.680 --> 54:13.560]  for me doing what it is that I'm doing breeding my own is the way for me to go I mean obviously
[54:13.560 --> 54:18.200]  I'll take strains you know that I know will dump very well you know the platinum or gorilla glue
[54:18.200 --> 54:23.080]  or something like that you know but if I can take that and mix that together then I get a
[54:23.080 --> 54:28.520]  plant that I after doing a phenol hunt you know should produce me some really really good hash
[54:28.520 --> 54:33.080]  and then you know give me a great yield but it does it depends on your grower depends on the
[54:33.080 --> 54:38.520]  techniques it depends on the lighting depends on the nutrients it depends on how you wash it
[54:38.520 --> 54:43.800]  your conditions outside your relative humidity all of that and don't let that scare you guys I mean
[54:44.280 --> 54:51.240]  it does it scares it scares so many people and that's why also they you know kind of do fall
[54:51.240 --> 54:55.400]  in line and do the same stuff because there's so much rotting on that especially for the small
[54:55.400 --> 54:59.640]  time farmer I mean a lot of that stuff you're just trying to flip and make money for your family
[54:59.640 --> 55:04.920]  you're not a lot of those guys aren't really just trying to be the phenol hunter you know they're
[55:04.920 --> 55:11.240]  dialed in with clones from a homie from a homie probably that that's trodden true so it's you're
[55:11.240 --> 55:16.840]  in a unique position I feel like to again be self-taught but then have that scope of the a to
[55:16.840 --> 55:23.240]  z where you know where that that basic canvas is coming from because you grew that and then you
[55:23.240 --> 55:28.120]  continue to educate yourself with knowledge as well as what I again I hope that we hone in today
[55:28.120 --> 55:34.040]  on the show is that experience really matters so I know a lot of people are super hesitant because
[55:34.040 --> 55:38.040]  of what you were just saying like I mean there's just so many variables that you can fuck up and
[55:38.840 --> 55:44.200]  especially if you know you're purchasing that or you know getting material that just is subpar and
[55:44.200 --> 55:49.560]  maybe you don't know that yet you know there's just so many again variables I feel like that
[55:49.560 --> 55:54.600]  to really dial it in I feel like you have to understand things maybe a few months to maybe
[55:54.600 --> 56:02.840]  six months to a year before you really are going to you know I guess jump full full speed into
[56:02.840 --> 56:08.360]  creating this kind of stuff because again I'm not I don't do this at all but I see a lot of
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.920]  guys making mistakes and I feel like it's it's from being rushed and that's not what I'm hearing
[56:12.920 --> 56:17.560]  from you today is that you're taking the time to figure stuff out grow out your own genetics which
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.280]  I again kudos to you on that man because there's not a lot of people that are doing that as well
[56:22.280 --> 56:26.760]  as growing as well as washing so again that's why we wanted to have you on the show is because
[56:27.560 --> 56:32.280]  it's another way for us to show that you know you take the time you educate yourself nobody can take
[56:32.280 --> 56:38.040]  that from you and then you can make a nice little business for yourself yeah definitely I mean I um
[56:39.560 --> 56:45.080]  I've always been the one to where if I'm going to do something I'm going boss to the wall I'm gonna
[56:45.080 --> 56:52.760]  do oh lord I'm gonna do I'm gonna do everything man like with this with this right now I mean
[56:53.560 --> 56:59.800]  I can't do every single thing but yeah man I can make my own seeds I can grow my own product I know
[56:59.880 --> 57:04.920]  how to harvest it I know how to you know grow some really good product I can take that and I can
[57:04.920 --> 57:09.800]  give you bubble hash I can get you temple ball or rosin a vape pen you want some chowder I can give
[57:09.800 --> 57:14.040]  you that you need a topical you want sugar you want salt whatever it is that you need I can give
[57:14.040 --> 57:20.360]  you all of that I'm not using chemicals to get that so that's one thing that I like to be able
[57:20.360 --> 57:25.480]  to tell people is that yeah I can go from seed all the way up to that vape cart all the way up to your
[57:25.560 --> 57:29.160]  tincture all the way up to that cookie that you may eat there ain't a single chemical that I've
[57:29.160 --> 57:35.480]  used in it so being able to have the ability to be able to do those things make it so where I can
[57:35.480 --> 57:39.960]  play around with whatever it is that I want to I mean you're talking about edibles hell I've literally
[57:39.960 --> 57:45.880]  had green eggs and ham I can make ice cream I can make beef jerky I can make you know coffee cream
[57:45.880 --> 57:49.000]  or coffee cream here's the shit though if you can do that I'm telling you that's nice bro
[57:49.480 --> 57:49.980]  good
[57:55.320 --> 57:58.600]  all right so here's the million dollar question for the audience
[57:59.480 --> 58:08.360]  how long did it actually take you to get to the level you are at this is what people either don't
[58:08.360 --> 58:16.040]  believe or they you know think I'm lying or they may actually hate on but I shit you not man I
[58:16.040 --> 58:27.520]  started growing three four months before they actually made it 100% legal here I didn't say
[58:27.520 --> 58:36.720]  that Mr. Officer but I did I started out 2018 we legalized it here in Oklahoma in August 2018
[58:38.000 --> 58:44.080]  October or the end of September is whenever I apply for my license I got approved in October
[58:44.080 --> 58:49.520]  and I hit the ground running then before that the way I justified it was hey I had some back
[58:49.520 --> 58:53.920]  seats you know they may turn out to be a male so you know this ain't necessarily me growing
[58:53.920 --> 58:57.920]  marijuana you know so I did I took a little bit and called it try some shit it worked I
[58:57.920 --> 59:02.480]  smoked shit it worked tried to clone all of a sudden I got 50 fucking plants and I was like oh
[59:02.480 --> 59:11.520]  shit like I can do calling it very well but 2018 is when I started growing and I haven't stopped
[59:11.600 --> 59:17.680]  since every day all day I'm working I mean I live out at my farm and my processor so I live and
[59:17.680 --> 59:27.520]  sleep and work at work you know so I have taken the time to dive in to almost every aspect that
[59:27.520 --> 59:34.720]  I can get into I pretty much got obsessed I wanted to learn everything I wanted to be able to say
[59:34.720 --> 59:40.800]  that I can do every part of that industry the best that I know how and I didn't have
[59:41.360 --> 59:47.680]  a whole lot of people teaching me I mean to this day I've only been into
[59:50.160 --> 59:56.960]  maybe three commercial grows so I've never even actually been to many grows to be like oh this is
[59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.120]  how you set this up you know there ain't no books out there that say hey this is how you want a
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:07.680]  commercial grow you know what I mean so I took that time to just try to teach myself read as much
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.640]  as I could and so about three years now I'll tell it would be three years that I really started this
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:24.880]  I didn't start doing bubble hash and things like that until 2019 I played around with it about
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.920]  2018 but 2019 is when I actually had enough product to be able to do anything with so
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:37.120]  about three years man so I think the key is that you got after it like you immersed yourself and
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.160]  that's where a lot of people fail is because they haven't put the energy and effort into it
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:49.760]  and again there's no such thing as failure it's a lesson you learned a lot of lessons really quick
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:57.040]  and really hard let me let me ask you this you talked about doing you know small test batches
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:03.200]  in a jar I think that's a that's a really key gold nugget for the audience it's like don't go
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:09.600]  after it all in practice it try a couple different things on a smaller scale so you don't fucking
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.720]  lose your two pounds or three pounds can you talk about that a little bit on how to do this on a
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.080]  really small scale no jar test is extremely important when I learned about a jar test I was
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.760]  like well why are you no work I didn't know I didn't know anything about this I didn't know
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:33.760]  this was possible so what a jar test is I don't have a jar out here but you just take a regular
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:40.800]  mason jar you know so size about a liter size or whatever you take seven to ten grams throw it in
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.680]  the freezer pretty much what you're doing is mimicking your wash just on a super super small
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.640]  scale but you take eight to ten grams seven to ten grams throw it in the freezer you get you a
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.600]  mason jar with a good lid on it put you some ice water or put some water in there with you
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.680]  with some ice throw it in the fridge or the freezer you know for a little bit to get as
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.720]  cold as possible without actually freezing it and then take your product throw it in the jar
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.400]  shake it up for I don't know five minutes you know and then put it back in the refrigerator
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.520]  and all the dry cones will sink down to the bottom and if you've got a good yield off of
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:19.120]  that jar test it'll give you an idea what's going to come out on the wash
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:26.000]  and so if you guys on instagram check out Terry Hayes Collective
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.280]  right there on instagram there is a few pictures of the jar test that I did and you can compare
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:42.000]  you know certain strains that did really well in the jar test and some that you know didn't do
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.240]  hardly anything jar test is extremely important especially on a small level like that and even
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:54.480]  a commercial level I mean I don't want to go buy 10 pounds of flour or 10 pounds of trim or whatever
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:59.920]  to wash it and I have no idea what it's going to give me I mean you're talking as a as a small
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.840]  brewer you know you got a pound or two and that pound or two is extremely you know that's your
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.320]  shit like you will fight your life for this little pound of weed that you have that's yours you know
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.880]  same thing with the commercial level I mean I don't want to go spend five ten grand trying
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.560]  to buy something I don't know if it's going to wash and get my money back so a jar test is
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.720]  extremely important to be able to not fuck yourself all right now here's another one
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:31.840]  how the fuck you get into 27 degrees that's not hard man it really ain't like I say um
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.240]  it was whenever friends you can know because I mean I did I majored in chemistry when I went
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:43.200]  to college so I do have some of a background on the basically molecules and stuff like that
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:51.120]  chemistry and how things work and you have a point to where in water so you got water right here and
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:58.400]  you got ice right here well in between that water and that ice that water is actually colder than
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.080]  the ice and so at that point right there is where you can get and there's a name for and I can't
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.200]  think of what it's called right now but um at that point you can get water to get at a lower
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:15.280]  temperature than it would to make it not freeze and keeping that water moving keeping the ice
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.560]  moving keeping it melting adding ice into it adding the water into it you can get that temperature down
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.760]  so it's all about movement again that's why you know the waterfalls don't freeze but the edges do
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.560]  so it's about keeping it in mobile and I think I think it's actually called easy water the zone
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:42.640]  between the ice and the true liquid water where it does get below freezing without without
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:50.800]  exactly exactly and so whenever I do my um whenever I put my product in the freezer
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:59.200]  I cut it and I put it in the freezer my product does not get above pretty much a freezing
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:07.360]  temperature until it goes to the press so I'll freeze it and out the freezer it will go
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:16.320]  into the washer which is already set up with ice and water I take um I use I use a big deal
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.160]  I put my ice and water in there and it's wrapped up so it'll stay cold I've got the deal that I
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:30.400]  use my water and ice in I've got ice to stay in that for three days straight without doing anything
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:36.720]  with it it stays that cold so keeping it that cold um using that water in that machine um
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.720]  soon as I collect I put it on my tray it goes right in the refrigerator and then as soon as
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:47.040]  that tray is filled up boom it goes right into the freezer after that freezer it goes into the
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.360]  freeze dryer where it dries and then after that I'll sit and it goes right back into the freezer
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.840]  then when I get ready to press it I'll take it out throw it in my bags throw it on the press
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:00.400]  once it comes off in the collective boom right back into the freezer it will never get above
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:06.400]  freezing temperature until it is on the press and then when I get ready to cure and I think
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:13.280]  that is what is helping me get those hot serving numbers well there's a fucking gold nugget
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:23.280]  never let it warm up right when it gets cut down into the time it's like I say on that press
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.520]  it's below freezing how long are you keeping it at that temperature as long as you can through
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:34.160]  the processor it's one thing I've learned if you keep it cold you can keep it as long as you want to
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:40.320]  right so like once you get to that the temperature that you're after you're not
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.400]  adding ice anymore as long as you keep it moving it's not going to need anything else or you know
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:51.200]  I will keep I'll keep checking it but I know within like two washes to like 15 minute washes
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:57.360]  it's still going to be good after doing it for so long I mean literally I can hear the ice in
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.360]  the machine and I'll know if I need to put more ice off in there it ain't making enough noise you
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:07.680]  know what I mean it's uh even that you know becomes important by just doing it over and over
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.840]  you know so yeah I will add ice and stuff back into it I will add more water into it.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:20.800]  There's definitely an art form to this you know then that art form is all those different variables
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:26.880]  dialing all that stuff in for your environment and then getting back to those those genetics
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.520]  are there certain genetics that you feel like more from like a breeder standpoint so that the
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:37.040]  viewers maybe could go out there and you know a lot of guys nowadays are kind of spending or
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:42.320]  charging I feel like a lot of money for some of their genetics they knew you know if the customer
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.480]  knew how many seeds you actually get with that kind of stuff so sometimes they're warranted the
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.440]  price point and sometimes it's not so for the newer viewers are there are there certain breeders
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.920]  out there that just seem to dump for you you know maybe three out of four that you've run through
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:01.120]  or something like that where you could just give another little gold nugget of a tried and true
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.880]  genetic profile that's going to going to work because I mean that is you're probably talking
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.640]  realistically about almost close to a year getting all that shit set up you know make the wrong
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.600]  I'm uh I'm gonna answer this question real quick and then I gotta run and grab my charger because
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:24.240]  my phone's about to die all right all right fair enough one of my one of the guys who's breeding
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:32.000]  that I like right now is Rocky Mountain High um yeah he's on Instagram he um has bred one called
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.320]  Hitman OG and that one is supposed to be like a nine percent dumper in there so I've got one of
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.640]  those and the thing is though I really hope not but I think I got a male and so I'm gonna probably
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:48.960]  end up breeding it and using it into my program but um cultivars I mean like I know in house
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.280]  genetics is pretty good ethos genetics are good some of the big labor companies like that are
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.520]  good you know some cap cuts some bloom seed company they've got strains that they actually
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:03.840]  you know make for you know making hash and solvent products with I've learned that a lot of the actual
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:10.480]  strains is what depends as well like if you've got some platinum cuts in there if you've got some uh
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:16.320]  like I said Gorilla Glue number four washes really well some GMO washes really well um some MAC I mean
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.120]  MAC MAC will kick your ass I mean you'll be watching MAC 14 15 times and you're just like
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.440]  all right fuck you on like I can't wash you anymore you know because it'll keep dumping like
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:32.560]  that so certain strains I think is what people should more look for in that and what that breeder
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.040]  is doing um obviously you want to deal with a reputable breeder or somebody that's actually
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.480]  you know been doing it for a while that's got some type of products that they can show you that
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.440]  they've done you know I'm not out here selling genetics because I don't have that much of it and
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.280]  I can't tell you you know hey I got 15 different strains that I've made you know I'm working on
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:57.120]  that but if you're out and you're trying to you know find you a good hash strain look at bloom
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:04.720]  seed company check out uh Holly Rocky um check out some in-house genetics check out some uh ethos and
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:13.440]  trying to think right now I'm drawing a blank um but that and then looking at certain strains
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.320]  um certain strains that was done anything with a GMO anything with a mat you know something like
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.520]  that yeah it's probably gonna give you a pretty good yield off of it and that's what I hope the
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.240]  viewers are starting to see that like just squishing washing whatever you plan to really
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.680]  do with it you really have to think this through way before these are chess moves um if this is
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.960]  where you want to especially if you're learning about all of this today you know uh you went from
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.680]  really not even understanding what this was to hopefully understanding at least why the importance
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.280]  of you know our opinion of getting the best quality medicine as the canvas and then taking
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.000]  it like you had mentioned you can make a variety of different products with that medicine uh but
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.040]  it's again that canvas that we're after not many people are willing to create a canvas that's
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:05.360]  tried and true uh of a quality medicinal aspect uh at the commercial level that's why so many people
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:12.480]  rely on the gray market yes oh for sure okay guys let me run in here grab this charger right quick
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.440]  and i'll be right there actually um like you was mentioning there may be some people out here who
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.520]  are really new and don't know a whole lot so i do have like a little small quick presentation i can
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:26.800]  show on the laptop to get people just like the beginning overgrew uh what the hell bubble hash
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:33.440]  even is you know yeah that'd be great man big time cool all right so go get go get it real quick
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.280]  i'm gonna grab that and again i think youtube oh yeah yeah get the charger brother
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.920]  don't lose you man
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.880]  he had mentioned almost like apologetic that he was able to learn so quick but i feel like that's a
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.560]  excuse me that's uh exactly what you're after especially people that are continuing to put out
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.000]  education is that you know with youtube and the fact that you can kind of even for the most part
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.560]  people will genuinely answer your questions and dms and that kind of stuff you really have no
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:11.520]  excuse to stay in age late and to not uh take your uh you know your expertise quicker than i feel like
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.400]  kind of the old guard if you will uh because that information was never there and then it was given
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.120]  to us by the the chemical companies which then you know we relied on and i feel like a lot of people
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.800]  still to this day um just rely on that because that's what they know they would love to grow
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.960]  you know in a certain certain manner but they just can't do that because that's the way their
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.160]  style they've been doing it for so long so that's why i you know a lot of these newer viewers i feel
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.320]  like or at least i hope that they gravitate to the fact of at least taking their time
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:46.640]  and planning this out like real chess moves getting the genetics that um because i feel like
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.400]  that's almost like a sticker shot i don't know how you feel layton but when you're filling up a
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.840]  commercial grow with quality genetics i mean those hundred hundred even hundred and fifty dollar packs
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.240]  those add up ridiculously quick and then if you want to really run the the deeper uh you know f3
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.720]  f4s and stuff those are usually like three five hundred dollars a pack so and then if you're
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.680]  gonna spend that kind of money get the the gorgeous flower everything's working out and
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.840]  then you have a blowout or you have uh just issues with a learning curve that's honestly why i feel
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:24.640]  like so many people are afraid to take it seems like danny just kind of took the leap you know
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.880]  well and just ran with it because his product is and people especially in a town where people are
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.960]  still kind of learning that and there is a learning curve in oklahoma he's a ahead of the the game
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:41.360]  with the quality of of the product itself yeah and again i think that the key was immersion like he
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.960]  he didn't he didn't back off he got after it man and i think that's you know the big difference
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.400]  between people that are successful um teaching themselves is because they just they wanted to
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.840]  know and even if someone said don't do it they tried it anyway because they wanted to prove it
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.920]  to themselves and i don't know how many people have told me oh you can't do that and i've done
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.360]  it and been very successful at it so it's having the balls to really go after it and try it and
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.800]  and understand why it didn't work not that it didn't work but understand why that it didn't
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.240]  work and i think you know that's where he separated himself from from a lot of people who you know
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:24.560]  tried it once and failed or or didn't didn't take into consideration all these variables um you know
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:30.240]  this this plant is is is a beast i mean in many ways yeah you can throw it outside and neglect it
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.840]  and you'll still get something but if you're pushing it and trying to get the the yields and
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.600]  and the maximum potential plant potential out of it the chances are you're going to fuck something
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:48.640]  and that's okay because again you learned okay i can't do that and this is the reason why but i
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:54.640]  think that the biggest gold nugget that he's dropped today is is really about taking everything
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.560]  into consideration i mean science the key to science is observation that's the foundation of
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.800]  it there's nothing more important than than observing and learning to listen to the clank
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.720]  of the machine oh it's not clanking as much i need more ice or or it's not sloshing as much
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.800]  that's observation and and i think that you know that's that's where the key to being successful
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:25.200]  really quickly comes into play is that you're you're being very absurd uh how do i say it being
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.000]  aware being present during the process you know like we talk about going out and spending time
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.880]  with your plant looking at it uh you know listening to the noises around whether it's you
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.480]  know in your greenhouse or whether it's out in the field um you know all those things are important
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.760]  to to understanding you know the potential of where it's going to go or whether you're going
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:55.600]  to crash and burn i mean farmer shadow is critical um you can you can catch the pest invasion before
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:01.280]  it gets too crazy or or you find a plant that has you know issues and you get rid of it now
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.800]  it's not issues aren't going to spread to the rest of the plants in the area so i feel like you and
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.520]  you know your plants like yeah you know you're kind of getting at is that you're really especially if
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.600]  you are going taking the time to do a pheno hunt you're really watching those plants those girls
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:24.480]  grow out hear me yeah you're back brother and we got just quickly terry did you want to is that the
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.920]  laptop you're on are you on something different do you need to switch devices
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:37.120]  shit can you hear me can you guys hear me at all yeah i can yeah we can hear you
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:48.800]  you can't yeah i can't hear anybody uh he's got to change his either log out and come back or then
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:52.880]  you got to change your cam mic now well he he was hearing you guys before right
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:01.200]  that was happened to me at the beginning of the show nothing uh jingle your because i feel like
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:07.600]  he has a yeah well yeah well i feel like he has a loose uh the only thing that works on stream yard
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:18.560]  leave come back set up the settings no his camera like uh um seems very like loosely connected
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.040]  oh like it's not all the way in was he using a camera like me now
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.720]  i mean latin you are by the way yeah
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.720]  well maybe let's just leave it on this shot for a while
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:44.160]  okay so i was asking are you are is the presentation on the device you're on right
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.080]  now or is it on a different device it's on my laptop it's on a different device
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.960]  okay so do you wanna do you wanna click the same link but on your laptop and i can bring that into
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:04.000]  the room oh um let me see if i can figure that out that would be awesome uh i do can you access
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:13.280]  instagram direct messages on your laptop i don't know if i have it on here um i'm opening the chrome
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:20.240]  browser on my laptop and see if i can click on it that way well yeah but you so do you have
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.400]  i'll tell you without telling uh 200 of the 300 other people your email address
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.960]  if you can text brian or actually brian you should be able to text well now he still needs
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.520]  to get it to his laptop so your laptop is where you can access your emails right
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  i can yeah i can access it from there
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.800]  or if you can just copy the link from the device that's on to your laptop browser window
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:04.160]  that's a emmy award winning uh peter over here fixing things he is the tech master
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:11.040]  hey peter did you ever get a hold of phil i did phil is correct
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.520]  wait you had to download what
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:26.080]  um i've got a mac so i had to download the google chrome onto this mac okay yeah yeah yeah yeah phil
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:32.160]  yeah phil uh texted me saying he was on a train to in montana
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:42.240]  and he's still super enthusiastic about closing the deal on the greenhouse i'm on a train to
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:50.880]  glacier park montana for all those people who know where that is um but anyway he'll be back in
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:58.080]  in a week and a half as i said my i was like so what do we need to do to have a september
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:04.320]  first move-in date i'm on a train catch you when i get back call me call me call me call me in
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:12.400]  october wait but that's that's after september i'm not talking 2022 oh man i figured we were
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:18.240]  getting that wrapped up with here wait every listen to here's a uh ready i'm gonna mute you
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:26.960]  guys you guys can listen to a a seed crack let's see oh did you hear that
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:45.400]  hey peter yeah i'm gonna send you a link to a recording of a canvas plant actually growing
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:52.600]  this is the coolest fucking thing ever um and this guy is going to be on the show at some point
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:21:06.480]  in the future okay so let me remove that okay you gotta unmute yourself though on the laptop
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.960]  then be unmuted on the laptop yeah yeah yeah so i yeah and then and then just click
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.240]  get out i'll actually uh you can just close out of the other device
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:26.040]  cool better work don't see okay so can you all good
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:35.480]  okay so you see me on here and then um yeah and you sound much better too this is okay good
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:47.000]  that's better now how do we bring up my presentation oh so you go to share do you
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.480]  see share on the bottom and then is your presentation open
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:05.480]  yeah it's open um okay so share share screen and then entire screen and then just make the
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:22.040]  presentation full screen and then i'll bring it into the very patient uh now did you share it
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:32.600]  uh i thought it did let me try back go back uh share share screen and then entire screen click
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:42.830]  on your screen and then click on the share once it turns blue did that do it no
[01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:44.290]  no
[01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:56.830]  you gotta share yeah share share screen entire screen and then you see your screen you gotta
[01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:03.070]  click on it and then it'll be highlighted and then at the bottom cancel and share the
[01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:10.750]  share should now be blue and you click on share okay yeah that's what i did um entire screen
[01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:19.330]  share today's technical fucking disaster
[01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:26.130]  crazy up wait no i didn't see anything uh
[01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.890]  yeah it's blue
[01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:39.250]  sunscreen blue that's weird all right try looking up in your tools in the toolbar
[01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:45.170]  up top okay is there anything up there is layton giving tech support this is i'm actually getting
[01:23:45.170 --> 01:23:55.090]  it from someone else if you if you want to email me the presentation i can uh queue it up on this
[01:23:55.650 --> 01:24:03.570]  oh i might be able to do that uh export to
[01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:17.870]  it's so weird it shows the screen
[01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:24.510]  and then but you got to click on the screen with your mouse so that it's it's highlighted there's
[01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:30.670]  a blue box all around it it goes around it yep yep do you see and then do you see cancel share
[01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:35.710]  below that you got to click on the share yep when i click share and then it just goes out every time
[01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:42.670]  i click share i brought my submission before okay hold on wait a minute let's see it says they lost
[01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:50.510]  permission to share the screen okay let's see and your mac i'll send the press you may need to go
[01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:59.870]  into chrome or chrome preferences i did this with layton earlier today okay and we crashed and burned
[01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:00.990]  and i had to go get a camera
[01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:08.670]  the third channel is going to be the tech support channel
[01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:12.190]  watch me do tech support for 24 hours a day
[01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:19.950]  i can bring my parents on as the uh most frequent recurring guests
[01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:29.070]  hey brian you haven't hit your pipe today what's going on man i'm focused on uh health a lot more
[01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:35.230]  i hit it uh hit it before the show but yeah gotcha yeah how is that how is that going yeah
[01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:43.230]  how long did you go without food uh just like four and a half days nothing yeah and again it took me
[01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:49.070]  maybe six months to build up for those four and a half days so well but yeah there's uh something to
[01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:54.430]  it man and i've immersed myself in again the word autophagy i cannot stress that enough
[01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:58.190]  well why don't you tell the audience about it while we're waiting for him to come back
[01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:05.710]  yeah so okay autophagy is kind of the new thing that i've immersed myself in um you know i i love
[01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:10.590]  to have a diverse group of like hobbies or interests and one of the things that i feel
[01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:18.910]  like i've kind of dove in full head or full steam is just learning um what autophagy is and it's
[01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:25.550]  basically the body is breaking down old like folded proteins um cysts and that kind of stuff
[01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:32.830]  um back but look that up real quick on youtube after after the show and i i promise you if you
[01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:38.590]  take the time and again this is these are chest moves um yeah the body takes forever to respond
[01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:46.910]  so now open your presentation yep yeah boom he's unstoppable all right i'm gonna mute everybody
[01:26:46.910 --> 01:27:02.890]  else and all right cool can you guys hear me we were muted but yet we can hear you
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.720]  but forget your phone for now look just do it from your computer
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.720]  okay cool all right so you guys can see the screen it says what is hash rosin and why should i care
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.600]  yes so looking to the medicinal prop can you guys even see me at all you just see my screen
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.960]  we can see both you and your screen okay i just wondered i want to be like picking my nose or some
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:35.920]  shit you know i can't you can pick your nose all right so yeah i made this presentation actually
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.480]  for the 710 event we had a couple of technical difficulties so i just ended up you know
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:47.680]  freestyling that but um this is the project that i had stayed up until like two o'clock in the
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:55.040]  morning trying to do for 17 didn't even show it so here we are so what is hash so hash or hash
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.720]  cheese is a medicine made by compressing the trichome heads um the most common forms of
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.800]  extraction or separation as i prefer to call it is um dry sift or bubble hash and so one thing
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:13.760]  frenchie canoli always said you know we're not extracting i'm not extracting um anything off
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.320]  anything off of this plant i'm just actually separating the trichome heads
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:23.520]  in order to be able to collect those to make the hash or to make hash sheets you know by pressing
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.200]  them together and making temple balls so this is not i don't consider myself an extractor i'm just
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:38.800]  i just separate it and so i focus mainly on keeping that idea in my head so i won't get confused on
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.640]  what the actual process is that we're doing we're not extracting we're not putting it in
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:50.720]  a chemical to separate parts of it we are just starting to take a part away from where we're
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:55.280]  just separating the trichome heads off of it so when you see after it comes out of the freeze
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.160]  dryer it's almost like sand that is a bowl full of straight trichome heads right there
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.200]  and if you wash it and dry it right it should come out to that consistency there
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.440]  so trichomes people want to know what trichomes are so trichomes are the most most of the
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:16.080]  cannabinoids are found in the in cannabis in the trichome head so the shape of the trichome
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:22.320]  extremely important in making the boba hash and separating the head from the stem involves
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.160]  careful attention to important factors so like when you're looking at these trichome heads you
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:31.200]  can see the different colors like in the stem there's a different color uh these obviously
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:36.960]  aren't quite mature heads here though that way they're still clear but like you were asking me
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:43.520]  earlier about what i look for in trichome heads i'm looking at that size of that head i'm looking
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:49.920]  at how long those stems are i'm looking at the colors um you see the purple stem i mean purple
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:57.040]  heads on the picture down here in the bottom i do have purple heads like that that color is
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:02.160]  most of the time going to come out in your hash not always and sometimes people cheat and they
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:08.000]  throw a little bit of their dark colored hash water into their tray and then all of a sudden
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.560]  they got purple trichome that's that's one of those little tricks that people use i don't mean
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:18.080]  that you have actual trichome heads so i'm paying attention to all of those things like that so we
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.640]  got different consistencies with the hash i mean you can have just straight boba hash like in the
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:28.960]  top picture there which it looks like sand um you can take it and gently press it and call it
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:35.280]  uh hashish which is your temple your temple balls um which is in the next picture up there you can
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:41.200]  actually take it and obviously turn into a rosin to where you get the picture down at the bottom
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:47.120]  that looks uh almost chunky chalky color you know and then you can actually make it and get it into
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:55.120]  a almost a shot consistency as well as a vape you can take the hash rosin and actually incorporate
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:31:00.720]  that into things like mct oil or coconut oils something like that and actually make you a
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:07.440]  really good tincture out of using just the hash rosin that um that process there makes it to
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.600]  where you eliminate a lot of the chlorophyll and stuff like that when you if you were making
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:15.360]  butters because you've already refined it and you have it concentrated so you can take
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:22.480]  the hash rosin like that and make really good tinctures and butters and stuff like that topicals
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:29.680]  things like that um so terry just quickly see at the bottom of the screen it says stream yard is
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:36.480]  sharing your screen and then you see the hide so keep going yeah that's it
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:44.000]  wait no sorry all right don't do that all right share it again i thought that would hide the
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.840]  the alert oh at the bottom i see what you're saying uh all right so so so start over again
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:59.520]  share that again are we here yeah yeah just make it big yep okay okay oh yeah now it's gone
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:06.480]  and i'm getting a bubble hash so a bubble has to be made from whole plant fresh frozen or some
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:13.520]  slightly cured flower trim um gentle agitation of the fresh frozen and ice bath allow the
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:19.840]  trichomes to be separated and collected and then after drawing the next steps can be taken to keep
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:25.440]  the integrity of the ice bath and then the next step is to make the bubble and then the next step
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:31.280]  after drawing the next steps can be taken to keep the integrity of the actual trichomes and
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:36.560]  the oils that's inside so basically what we're doing is we're taking the marijuana and we are
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.360]  throwing it in the ice bath i mean you've got a machine or trash can or whatever you're washing
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:47.520]  in a five gallon bucket filled with ice and water and we are washing and this right here is when i
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:55.520]  wash it by hand but the way that you wash is extremely important if you are moving the water
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.040]  too much you're melting the ice too fast and you're breaking down the plant material you'll
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.880]  get a lot of green stuff into your product a lot of green chlorophyll in there so you got to be
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:11.040]  careful about the actual technique on how it is that you're watching it um we take it and then
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:17.360]  after that we will sift it through our bags i use rosin evolution bags shout out to them
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:24.560]  eventually i think i may break the uh bank and go ahead and get those bugatti bags from ice extracts
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.440]  uh you guys are watching y'all want me to you know try to mouth holly at me i got you you know
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:34.800]  i'll let you know how good they are um but yeah so i have to be washing it or whatever when you
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.040]  sift it through the bags this uh the bottom picture here is showing you like the water coming out of
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:45.440]  the bag and being able to collect it um so after we collect it in this jar and it gets to that
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:52.080]  consistency the way it looks like um sand we'll take it and we will put that into another micron
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:34:00.400]  bag which are different sizes um i use rosin evolution bags as well that's a 37 bag we've got
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:07.920]  27 bags um i will double bag it a lot of times to prevent blowouts prevent it from moving so
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.120]  a lot of times when i'm pressing i'm using a 25 micron bag and it's usually double bagging another
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:18.000]  25 micron or maybe even a 37 just kind of depending on the product that i'm using
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.680]  but always double bag if you guys are pressing double bag and double bag means when you have your
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:35.200]  bag like this you will take it you will put your sand like bubble hash into that bag after you fill
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:41.360]  it up you take it and you put it into another bag and that helps it from blowing out and it also
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.800]  helps it from once the oils and stuff start to come out of that bag we won't slide off the plate
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:52.240]  so it's extremely important to double bag um so when we're pressing bubble hash like the art of
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:58.000]  the squish so we actually put in the micron bags and then we utilize heat and presser and we press
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.760]  those chalk cones heads together to squeeze out the oils and then after that we immediately collect
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.360]  and we like i said we put it in the freezer to keep it back cold so that's great terry before
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:17.280]  you go on so did you dry the stuff out of the bubble bag first to make it uh sandy or did you
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:26.320]  did you press it wet no we dry it so after it comes back out of we go back here so there it
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.280]  is washing there and after we wash it the tricone heads are suspended in the water so we'll drain
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:37.040]  the water out of the machine which is the next picture there draining the water out and all of
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.720]  those chalk home heads are being sifted through the the bags there this is a different setup that
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:48.160]  i had before but all of those are being sifted and caught into the bags there and so we're taking
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.000]  them we'll clean that up and we'll get to where we just have to hash and this is just water coming
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.720]  out the bag and we'll take a spoon and we'll collect that hash onto a tray and that's when
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:05.120]  i use a freeze dryer to actually dry it oh there's the trick so you freeze dry now that'll
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:09.360]  get it dry real quick yeah you're a freeze dryer now to get it dry and then you have that
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.280]  at the beginning that sand like consistency right there and that's how you know that it's good and
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.280]  dry so the freeze dryer is a way to do it you obviously you don't have to have a freeze dryer
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.920]  to dry it just on a commercial level and worrying about things like that contaminants and stuff like
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:33.520]  that and to make sure that it's dry i would have to use a freeze dryer thank you
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:41.680]  so then yeah um after it's dry then you take it and you put it into the micron bags like that
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:50.080]  and this is a press here that i did um i want to say that was white blueberry string i believe
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:54.640]  or it might have been the bonberries what it was but that was one coming off the press there um
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:01.360]  my setup i don't have a huge press i have a smaller press um there's been several people
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:05.760]  that's like oh you know i love your little press it's so cute and i'm like you this is what i got
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.240]  this is what i could afford so hey it may not be a big press but you know i've got some good product
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:17.920]  coming out of there bigger always it isn't always better not always better i can guarantee you that
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.360]  yeah i don't know a lot of different things especially when you're watching you have to have
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:33.040]  have to have the right consistency of water ice and your actual product in the washer so
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:39.920]  just because you got a 20 gallon you know machine doesn't mean that you need to put 10 pounds of
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.520]  product in there it's not going to come out right you got to be able to play around with it and get
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:50.000]  that right ratio product that's able to move and be suspended in the water while you're washing it
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:38:00.680]  in order to be able to get those tricones to fall off sorry somebody was asking me about a good trim
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:06.040]  run that they wanted to have so i've been working on that today as well um so depressing you know
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:12.520]  temperature is very important the amount of time that the product is actually on the press and the
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:17.640]  pressure is all strain dependent it all depends on the strain how you grew it the tricone heads
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:24.040]  all of that stuff you know so uh the consistencies are so as well can be very dependent on that you
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:30.120]  know the pressure time the culture bar all of that stuff comes in to play whenever you are trying to
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:39.480]  make hash especially when you're doing them to the press the step from the bubble hash up to the press
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.080]  is extremely important i mean there's a lot that goes into that i said the humidity the pressure
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.120]  the time the temperature all of that the product starting material all that goes into whenever
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:58.120]  you're making um making rosin so like i said the yields directly depend on all of that stuff um too
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:03.480]  much heat can cause it to be darkening too much time on the plate can cause it to darken up and
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:08.440]  start to lose terpenes and if you're pressing too fast at high temperature you can cause yourself a
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.880]  blowout and then you can screw up a whole press right there once you get a blowout i've had plenty
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:20.440]  of blowouts and so those can be detrimental to making hashrods fresh on a commercial level you're
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:27.960]  talking i'm pressing 14 to 20 some odd grams at once and so if you get a blowout you're talking
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.600]  about oh my god i just screwed up a lot of money and i gotta try to fix it so being careful hey
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:37.000]  danny real quick can you can you break that down for the newer viewers on what a blowout is because
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.920]  that is the one that is like the the dagger in the heart for uh someone growing it as well as
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.960]  you know trying to do this all on their own so just real quick can we talk about what a blowout
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.360]  is and then and then kind of get back to that because i don't want people to uh ever experience
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.880]  that hopefully you'll uh teach them not to experience that today yes um a blowout yeah
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:05.560]  blowout is definitely a dagger to the heart that can hurt your soul on that day uh what that is is
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:11.640]  basically when you have the bubble hash like i said consistency into the bag and you have it on
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:17.880]  your plate and you're pressing if you press too hard if you press too fast if you don't have the
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:26.600]  right temperature you can basically squish the actual hash the bubble hash out of the bag your
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:35.560]  bag will actually bust and so when you're trying to separate oil from the bag with you know with
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.840]  that bubble hash and then you're pressing these chalk homes and you're trying to get the oil to
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:43.960]  sift through the bag again well when the bag blows you pretty much have everything run out and
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:50.280]  you can't separate it the way that you need to and once you have a blowout i mean you can collect it
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:56.120]  and try to press it again and stuff like that but it does degrade your product because then you're
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:02.600]  doing a second press on it so blowouts are never a good thing i've got a video of a blowout somewhere
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:07.320]  i have to find it to where you can see it's coming out nice and good and everything's coming out
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:13.560]  great and then all of a sudden you can feel the press just kind of pop a little bit and give and
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.280]  once it does that and then you can start seeing the actual bubble hash start coming out on your
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:23.720]  press and yeah that's not something that you want ever so one other quick question is how are you
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:31.560]  cleaning the bag or the paper that the that the materials coming out on so if you guys have if
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:36.600]  you guys are following on instagram on some of my reels i put what i use a uh i call it a roll
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.480]  technique i don't know if i made it up or what but basically when i'm connecting i'll get a
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.640]  collecting i'll get enough rosin so i can roll it up into a ball i mean i'm to evolve to almost
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:52.920]  like the shape of this and then i can take it and roll it across the parchment paper to be able to
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.720]  collect all of it without using tools to scrape it up and stuff like that i can just make it roll
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:08.040]  and collect upon itself so guys check out some of the reels that i have on instagram i do
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:13.240]  show some of those techniques on collection because that does become really important you
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.520]  know you did all that work trying to press it now you got to try to figure out how to get out the
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:22.760]  parchment paper there's a really easy way to do it if you allow it to cool just a bit and roll it
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:31.780]  off of that plate roll it off of that parchment paper cool thank you for those brian do you have
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:37.060]  something you wanted to say before you get to back on no i just wanted and i appreciate that dan i
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:40.820]  know like when you're in your flow of doing presentation but i wanted people not to sit there
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:45.220]  and question what that is because there's a main point um you know you're going to minimize people's
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:50.420]  potential six months nine months 12 months whatever you know cultivars they're running
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:55.780]  um you know you could have saved them a year of their time so i felt like we should break that
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:00.260]  down and then i appreciate that buddy and let's continue yeah definitely blowouts are not okay
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:04.980]  blowouts is when you're back you know bust so definitely pay attention to how fast you are
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:10.740]  pressing pay attention to your temperature you want to be able to have a good consistency of
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:16.740]  the trichomes melting and being pushed out the bag and quickly off the plate as quick as you can
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:23.060]  so you'll have some people who have a press that will actually turn sideways that way whenever
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:28.580]  you're pressing this immediately dropping down off of the plates because once you press it and
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:33.540]  it's just sitting on that plate when that plate is hot and that plate is degrading your terpenes
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:38.500]  and that's causing it to lose a lot of its potency when they're just sitting on that plate
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:43.220]  so you want to have a setup to where as you can see like in mine whenever it starts to press
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:50.900]  it's immediately boom is being pushed off uh off the plates and that goes into how you actually
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:56.980]  fold your paper that can be important um to be able to get that rosin to either push off the
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:02.420]  back side of that plate or be able to form that paper so that rosin can come out the front of that
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:07.300]  paper there and get off that plate as quick as you can so playing around with things like that
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:14.900]  are extremely important i actually will put a post up about how i fold my papers that way people can
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:21.860]  see i've got a way to where when my rosin is being pressed out of the bag obviously it's going every
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:27.860]  direction so i have a directional flow to where it actually presses out the back of the bag and it
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:34.580]  goes around and flows out the front as you can see in that video there you have rosin that's coming
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:38.740]  out the back and then you'll start seeing on the edge see how it starts coming out because i've got
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:43.300]  it to where that directional flow makes it to where when it hits the back of that paper it
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:50.670]  forces it to come all the way out the front and get off of that paper for me that's gorgeous by the way
[01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:57.310]  i appreciate it thank you very much uh so that's what i'm saying right there um the rosin can be
[01:44:57.310 --> 01:45:03.870]  collected off the parchment paper you know um that you use during the press um then i take it
[01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:11.630]  and i immediately put it into a jar so i can get it quickly back into the freezer to save my terpenes
[01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:17.950]  um i used to take it like you see in that second picture there and whip it up really really good
[01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:24.670]  i will take some time to whip it up like that but the whole process of doing that once it comes off
[01:45:24.670 --> 01:45:32.110]  the plate is to harmonize the terpenes and the THC and get everything together however me
[01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:38.750]  personally i don't necessarily like doing that i will maybe for a little a few times but i like to
[01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:44.030]  collect it and throw it immediately into the jar and as it's curing at different levels you can
[01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:50.590]  actually see that terpene layer rise up to the top and so i personally not like everybody else
[01:45:50.590 --> 01:45:54.590]  some people taking their whipping and whipping and whipping and whipping that's just that's just
[01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:58.990]  not what i do i want to have everything to where i can immediately get it into that jar and immediately
[01:45:58.990 --> 01:46:04.510]  get it back into the freezer so i can preserve all those terpenes and if any of y'all start using my
[01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:08.750]  tips and my steps and stuff like that y'all just give me a shout out man that's all i really ask
[01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:18.790]  for this is free information man write this shit down this video here is me uh me whipping it a
[01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:24.070]  little bit that's pretty much taking it and like i say getting it everything in the same consistency
[01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:32.710]  there so after the press i say i have uh you know color doesn't matter the one on the left is uh
[01:46:32.710 --> 01:46:39.350]  white blueberry straight that i did and then the one on the right is the black cherry punch and
[01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:44.390]  the darker colored one is actually has higher terpenes than the lighter colored one um and
[01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:49.750]  actually has more cannabinoids in there so i'll tell everybody being a black man i'm gonna tell
[01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:56.390]  you color doesn't matter okay so color doesn't matter and since like i say if you've got darker
[01:46:56.390 --> 01:47:01.030]  you know trichomes and stuff like that you're gonna have more of cbn to come out just like
[01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:07.670]  you would on you know your flower and stuff like that so uh those ethins are the pigments that are
[01:47:07.670 --> 01:47:13.510]  in the trichomes that will give us purple purplish color and stuff um and obviously purple cannabis
[01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:18.470]  purple trichome heads it's going to give you a darker hash i mean it's the color that is actually
[01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:22.310]  the color of the trichome so if you see in those pictures i mean some of those leaves some of the
[01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:28.790]  trichomes on there i mean they almost they're so purple that they look black um and so that picture
[01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:33.990]  there below the white blueberries a darker one that's what that flower looked like before i
[01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:39.510]  washed it and then the white blueberries you can see the difference in those flowers uh the color
[01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:49.120]  and that obviously gave me a different color hash um again of the terpene are extremely important
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:54.640]  with me um i think that's where your medicinal properties are and a lot of terpenes are
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:48:00.080]  extremely volatile so they can actually evaporate um at room temperature and a little bit of small
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:06.480]  heat um you can start to lose you know your terpene content in that um so having a cold room
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.480]  a cold cure you know keeping it in the jar keeping it out of the air um are good ways to cure your
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.840]  rosin to be able to preserve all of those terpenes and those medicinal products there
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.520]  this here was some pictures of some hash that i did a while ago i um posted some of this on
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:30.320]  the frenchie cannoli's uh contest that he had and he actually wrote me back one day and told me that
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:41.920]  i made good ooh la la and so regardless so um he helped out more people than i think we even
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.640]  realized and will continue to for years to come especially with the platforms that his information
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.920]  are on so you guys want to you know check out somebody definitely go check out frenchie cannoli
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.920]  there's a lot of information out there for you i mean there's a lot of other hash people out there
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.160]  but that's one you know me personally he's been doing it for a while it didn't belong to see like
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.800]  and i personally i like those cool ways too if it ain't broke don't fix it so i like to keep it that
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:14.480]  way um do you cure for in the freezer it depends um every strain is different so i've got some
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:22.240]  strains to where i've got a strain in there now it was a strawberry lemon haze that i washed and i
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:30.000]  pressed and i did a real low temperature whenever i um pressed it off the i'm using my low temp plates
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:37.440]  and it never did butter up it still has that shatter like consistency to it so some strains
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:43.440]  just won't um then i've got some strains hell man in like two days they will butter up and get that
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:49.440]  good consistency that i want kind of liking that picture so it really depends um i like to leave
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:54.800]  it in the freezer as long as i can until i get where you need it um doing a cold care i think
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:00.720]  is a way to preserve that and so like i was saying earlier you can see that top layer of
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:05.600]  that terpene sauce there that's for me not whipping it or anything throwing it immediately
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:11.520]  into the jar it formed the shape of the jar and after it cured up all those terpene
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:17.360]  rose up to the top like that and that's a good sign of the color and that terpene separation
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:22.960]  to know that it's cured but uh answer to your question it is still all strain dependent man
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:29.600]  it really is so will you would you mix those terpenes back in as you package the product for
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:36.720]  sale yes so um again on my instagram there's a reel of me cracking a jar you can hear the jar pop
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:40.320]  and then i'll take my tool and i'll sit there and i'll mix all those terpenes back off in there and
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:46.560]  you'll get that that juicy good you know like juicy look for your your truck i mean your
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:52.320]  hash rather so yeah i will mix all that back up in there nice nice well thank you for sharing all
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:57.840]  this this is uh this is very cool oh sure yeah thank you god i appreciate the opportunity guys
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.800]  for real um and then this here just saying you know after you get done with the rosin you can
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:09.840]  do things like uh that top picture that white stuff up there is straight taca so that was
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:17.680]  rosin that was cured up that i put back into a micron bag and repressed those terpenes out and
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:24.320]  collected the cannabinoids that was left you can um and the same thing even with the vape like
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:30.000]  you can take that rosin and obviously turn it into vapes as well but my favorite product though
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:37.280]  is obviously the taca that is a that's a smack to the face i mean that's like being high for the
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.400]  first time smoking that is when you laugh and giggle and sit down and watch like broth burgers
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:47.040]  for three hours you know that stuff is amazing it doesn't have any terpenes in it so it's more of a
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:54.800]  medicinal way in for like pain right you smoke some of that yeah you're probably not going to
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:52:01.920]  be hurting anymore so uh i mean it's straight taca yeah it doesn't have a funny flavor to it
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:06.480]  because it doesn't have terpenes it actually has no flavor to it because it doesn't have terpenes
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.800]  gotcha there's really no flavor into it doesn't really have a smell you can crack open the jar
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:17.600]  doesn't smell like anything really um i would love to be able to turn that into a vape but like
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:23.200]  i say i believe the terpenes are what help keep it at that consistency that you need in the vape so
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:33.040]  we'll keep it that way um terpenes here um we've been to terpene we know what terpenes are um
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:37.440]  like i said terpenes are found in many plants you know pine tree blueberries apple trees
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.600]  you know those are that smell is what the terpenes are and um in the marijuana the terpenes are
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:49.440]  mainly located in that trichome there are terpenes found in other places but mainly in the trichome
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:54.240]  head like i said that's responsible for your smell and taste as well as those trichomes are
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:59.200]  made for that those trichomes aren't made for us to be smoking all the time like that's not why
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:03.200]  they plant decide to make trichomes they're actually made to ward off pests and protect
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:11.120]  itself so what as a grower doing things like having a fan on it and shaking the stem and
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:18.560]  even poking a hole through the stem is basically causing that plant to produce a response um for it
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:25.920]  to protect itself which in turn it produces more terpenes and so terpenes are definitely made for
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:32.400]  our endocannabinoid system but that plant actually makes them to help protect itself so certain
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:38.160]  right type of stresses on that plant can make it to where it will give you more trichomes and
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:42.560]  i mean give you more trichome give you more terpenes out of there danny are you pinching
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:47.120]  stalks for terpene production because i heard sometimes that was like an old wives tale
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:54.400]  but pinching letting it bubble up pinching it again yeah yeah that's the way of uh basically
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:59.120]  super cropping so i definitely believe it works i've been able to see been able to tell you know
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:05.920]  the plants that i have to uh and even on the same plant so like you say whenever that plant is young
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:10.320]  you can go in and you can kind of break that cell wall by running it in between your fingers
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:15.280]  and then what'll happen is it will heal itself and we know these plants have amazing ability
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:22.640]  to be resistant to almost everything i mean i've had plants that my god i didn't i didn't even know
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:26.080]  they were growing until they were down there in flower and i went out and i looked out in the
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.000]  field and i was like holy shit there's a volunteer that i didn't even know was growing this fucker's
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.280]  10 feet tall and doing just fine never watered it never sprayed it with anything so the plants
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:42.720]  are extremely um resilient to a lot of things so that manipulation uh basically breaking that stem
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:49.120]  will cause it to heal itself and when it does that it forms almost like a ball like a nub on there
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:56.640]  and that nub becomes like a a hub for nutrients to go go through and so once you do that you can
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:01.440]  definitely tell a difference on the size of the bud and stuff like that because you're stressing
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:09.360]  that plant out um i had a question you mentioned earlier um when you're doing your extractions
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:15.760]  are you in a air conditioned room yes okay so that's key so you're really keeping everything
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:22.160]  as cold as possible during the entire process yes before i get ready to do any type of work in my
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.720]  processing building i will go out there and i'll turn the air conditioner on as low as i can get it
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:31.760]  and allow it to cool it completely off now the processing room that i have is one that i built
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:36.080]  i mean i can show you guys in a little bit but it's not that big i mean i'm under 400 square feet
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:41.360]  and you don't really have to have a whole lot of room to be able to make um the bubble hatch and
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:46.320]  be able to press it i've got a room separated just for the press um it's got its own air
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.960]  conditioner in it and then i've got a mini split air conditioner that cools off the whole building
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.600]  so like when i'm telling people you know i'll keep the temperatures as cold as i can the only time
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:00.000]  it gets warm is when actually on the press so when it's just sitting out in the bag the room
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:11.410]  is still about 50 degrees in here well there's a good gold nugget yeah you still annoying your
[01:56:11.410 --> 01:56:15.810]  presentation yeah you want to pop a little bit more i'm gonna run through it real quick it ain't
[01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:19.330]  much so this is going on about terpene more than anything it's just kind of the cool pictures i got
[01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:25.410]  on there um the first one you can see i did a jar tech to get a diamond sauce so you can see the
[01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:30.370]  that top level and then if you look at the bottom of that jar that white looking stuff is thc that
[01:56:30.370 --> 01:56:39.050]  has uh crashed out and crystallized in there um and again this is all about the terpenes um
[01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:43.050]  different terpenes we know give different effects medicinal properties but i have this
[01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:48.330]  picture on it this was a flower press that we did one day at an event and it was really crazy how it
[01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:51.690]  came out because it all looked like we call it like the tree of life you can see the stem and
[01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:55.770]  you see this whole tree and this was just a bud that we had so it actually you can see on the
[01:56:55.770 --> 01:57:00.810]  side where the flower press came out with some gray gray flower rosin i mean you can see how
[01:57:00.810 --> 01:57:07.610]  good and clear it is right there um even with that bud being a darker color since it's not cured we
[01:57:07.610 --> 01:57:12.170]  still got some water off in there that wouldn't cure you to 100% drop so still a little bit of
[01:57:12.170 --> 01:57:17.050]  water off in there we weren't able to get that color out in that press but i'm sure if we had
[01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:24.090]  more in there the concentration of that you'd be able to see that color um again i make topicals
[01:57:24.090 --> 01:57:30.010]  and stuff like that using my bubble hash and my hash draws and stuff like that there's my buddy
[01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:42.900]  he is the spokesman of the logo for the company there thank you that was a great presentation
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:48.980]  dude clearly spent some time on that well done yeah i appreciate it buddy thank you i mean i
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:53.700]  spent some time with it but i ain't gonna lie i was really stoned and it was late in the day
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:59.620]  whenever i did that but it came out okay it did dude it came out forget great man i think pictures
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:04.980]  are you know especially when they're your pictures that just speaks volumes man yeah yeah
[01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:09.140]  definitely i mean those are all pictures that i took except for the tricone heads on there i know
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:12.420]  it's something i downloaded but other than that all those pictures on there was stuff come out
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:18.100]  my garden come on my girl off my breast now what magnification are you using to look at your
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:25.300]  tricones before harvest oh man i have to look in my microscope i want to say it goes all the way up
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:31.140]  to 20 times magnification on it i'm not exactly sure so just enough to be able to see like i can
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:38.260]  get all the way down i can see the tricones gotcha i know they're very microscopic yes also heads up
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:44.260]  to to the listeners i've seen so many people fuck their microscopes up trying to do this because
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:49.620]  they get too close and they touch the head and it fucking ruins the lens and i don't care how
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:53.380]  much alcohol you throw on it you'll never get that fucking lens straight
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:05.940]  go ahead yeah because on my um oh my microscope is i think in the other building but mine actually
[01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:12.900]  has like almost a glass uh cap on it so you can get so close to it so you don't you won't like
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:17.700]  poke it all the way in there i know what you're saying though yeah so there's another gold nugget
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:22.420]  if anyone wants to use a microscope make sure you do get that cap to put over the bud so you
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:27.140]  don't fuck it up yes yes it's extremely important to have that because you will mess up an expensive
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:35.380]  ass microscope just trying to look at a bullet really easy where'd peter go peter do we have
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:48.570]  any questions you want to pop up up hold on layton i'm multitasking i'm uh facetiming with my brother
[01:59:48.570 --> 01:59:55.210]  who's uh at their yogurt making factory in brooklyn right now troubleshooting exciting
[01:59:55.210 --> 02:00:04.410]  payment gateway issues um but can can you guys look in can you guys see the chat brian you want to
[02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:10.970]  look into that chat right anybody with a question out there go ahead and hit us up while peter's
[02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:12.570]  more tech support
[02:00:15.930 --> 02:00:20.570]  well how about this real quick i know something that is popping off we kind of
[02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:26.490]  spoke on it briefly danny was static tech i know a lot of new viewers have no idea what that is
[02:00:26.490 --> 02:00:32.010]  because it's still new here relatively new here in colorado i would say pretty new in oklahoma as
[02:00:32.010 --> 02:00:37.530]  well so uh let's kind of start there on on some brand new tech uh the pros and cons of it would
[02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:46.490]  be great as well i personally so static tech is usually used for dry sift um that is where you're
[02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:53.930]  taking sifting trays almost like uh almost essentially like the bags that i use to make
[02:00:53.930 --> 02:01:00.890]  the boba hat except they're expressed out over screens and so you will take your um your dry
[02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:06.330]  sift like a lot of it's coming out of your trim bins and stuff like that and sifting it through
[02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:11.130]  these different size uh screens same thing i can say essentially what's used in the bag
[02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:18.250]  but the static tech park is where you can take parchment paper and you can rub this parchment
[02:01:18.250 --> 02:01:23.770]  paper over the screen and be able to separate the trichomes and the stems and the way that this works
[02:01:23.770 --> 02:01:30.410]  is there is a charge on these trichome heads and it's usually a positive charge so if you're able
[02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:35.770]  to create a negative charge you'll be able to get them to separate and so this is one of the deals
[02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:40.650]  now i don't know if anybody thought about it before but hey you heard it first here on future
[02:01:40.650 --> 02:01:47.450]  cannabis project with with terry hayes collective so what i have theory i have a theory about was
[02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:54.250]  since we know that these trichome heads does have a different charge on it if making our water
[02:01:54.970 --> 02:02:01.290]  have a charge if we will be able to separate the trichome heads a little bit easier so it's the
[02:02:01.290 --> 02:02:05.370]  same thing with the static tech except we want to be able to try to apply that with with the water
[02:02:05.530 --> 02:02:09.690]  i've got a couple of things that i've been working on trying to be able to get that to work but
[02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:14.570]  yeah the static tech is just using um parchment paper you can use like a
[02:02:16.170 --> 02:02:23.770]  a paint roller or maybe even a cdk something like that to be able to actually separate those
[02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:32.650]  trichome hands with the um with the charge that they have i personally know you're creating a
[02:02:32.650 --> 02:02:39.130]  static charge yes exactly so basically rub your feet along the carpet and then touch the screen
[02:02:39.130 --> 02:02:44.410]  and there you go charged it pretty much the only problem with charging the water is you would
[02:02:44.410 --> 02:02:50.730]  actually be it would be it's called electrolysis so you put in an anode to cathode now you create
[02:02:50.730 --> 02:03:00.010]  hydrogen and blow your ass up exactly so there's gotta be a way that i can figure this out to be
[02:03:00.090 --> 02:03:10.360]  able to throw some type of charge or some type of static you know oh shit oh man he was just
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:16.600]  gearing up yeah i got some questions geared up for him i do too i got green's goddess teed up but
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:25.480]  hopefully he'll pop back in and peter you i i tried to kick his uh his shared screen out of
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:34.120]  the studio but it uh oh you booted him why his screen up here he comes all right that was my
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:38.120]  oh that was my fault all right go for start start from the top
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:46.360]  let me i think you guys were talking static tech yeah
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:52.520]  my bad um
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:04.680]  the laptop is about to die i need to go grab that charge i'm at 80 i thought that was maybe
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:08.360]  the reason why but no with the static hey can you grab me a charger to the top top
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.760]  it's that cord that looks the same on both ends
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:18.920]  she probably want me to figure that out but no static tech i've never actually personally
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:24.840]  done static tech i have um looked into it i don't have the screens to be able to do my draw
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:30.680]  so i don't have a whole lot of information on static tech i understand the general idea of what
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.320]  it is but i wouldn't be the person that would be able to give you a whole lot of details on
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:41.000]  on the static tech at all well i think it's again just playing around with it you know just create
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:48.440]  static electricity right pretty much pretty easy to do you know rub a balloon freaking walk across
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:54.440]  the carpet with your socks and you know try to get charged up um so here's you see that question
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:01.640]  jar tech for the sauce how's that process work that one okay so yeah what you're doing with
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:05.960]  jar tech and there's a few videos that they have a lot i've got a couple of videos but essentially
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:12.840]  you are taking it like this in the jar and you are putting it into an oven with a little bit of heat
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:21.800]  the actual fact that is in this sealed jar will create pressure and so that makes it to where
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:27.640]  instead of using heat and pressure on a press you can get heat and pressure inside of this jar alone
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:33.800]  by itself and that process will that heating it up will make it to where you can get those
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:41.480]  uh tricones i mean the uh terpenes to be able to separate and then you can have all your THC
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:47.960]  crashed out to the bottom all right here's one from greens goddess shout out greens
[02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:53.960]  how long have you been growing with knf gardens recipes i don't know i actually just started with
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:06:00.200]  knf uh garden with van oh a few months ago about the time i did the first future cannabis project
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:04.040]  so that was june may uh
[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:24.260]  all right there we go um i've been doing the can of farming for the last i don't know maybe
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:31.140]  six months or so um doing the fermentation stuff like that but like i said before my soil is
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:36.500]  basically a can of farming technique that i didn't even know that i was actually doing until i really
[02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:44.020]  um like i say composting fruits and vegetables and things like that into my soil is essentially
[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:50.580]  what can that farming is except you're using plant fermentation and separating that and feeding into
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:58.180]  your plants you guys definitely got to check out um van at knf garden i'll see if i can find his
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:06.260]  instagram to give you guys uh you know a chance to go look at that because his i mean his
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:11.780]  product i mean i ain't got to do it gardens can of garden yeah if you can look at his page look at
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:16.260]  his pictures i mean if that dude told you to go stand on your head for five minutes every day you
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:21.140]  should be out there doing it it's gonna give you a product like that man seriously it's that good
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:28.100]  and his like uh against the grain i guess if you will is that um he doesn't foiler spray anything
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:34.180]  i wish i thought it's uh pretty unique so again you know these are all just tips and tricks you
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:39.860]  find your own lane and find your own way of doing things but we encourage you to learn from a variety
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:45.540]  of different people so that you can continue to kind of pick and choose i mean that's the real
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:49.940]  i feel like highlight of what peter's put together with the future cannabis project is you can kind
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:55.140]  of pick and choose who you want to sit there and listen to but there's so many videos uh that it
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:08:00.500]  just allows you to kind of go down those certain rabbit holes oh yes yes and there's you know
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:04.740]  the another thing too is there's gold nuggets in all of these different techniques and methods
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:09.780]  and it's just a matter of you know harvesting those and playing with them because you know
[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:15.780]  there is no right or wrong way we've talked about that in the past and just like you cherry you said
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:20.340]  i i found this volunteer out back i didn't want to do shit and look at it right sometimes
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:28.660]  better than than trying to freaking help it oh yeah i got a um a string that i call uh front porch
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:35.140]  i literally had a plant grow on it was right next to my front porch i don't know how the
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:40.020]  plant even made it i mean hell i didn't know that it was even there for a while and then
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:45.460]  after the dogs and pissed on it and ate half of it they still made it they still did good so i got
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:52.020]  a front porch is what i'll call it that's where you come out with um carlos has a question for
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:57.540]  you danny um it basically kind of like your outlier moment so how many presses did did you
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:02.900]  have to do before you started to get that uh kind of quality and i would imagine that consistent
[02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:09.140]  quality oh i mean it took a while i mean i can't say exactly how many presses it took but it did
[02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:16.020]  take quite a bit um i didn't even have a press at first like i literally i had i was the one who
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:23.300]  bought the um the the press from harbor freight and it comes with little plates that you're using
[02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:27.140]  for like metal pressing and stuff like that man i was taking those plates and i was throwing them
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:31.460]  in the convection oven letting them get hot and running outside putting them on the on the press
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:36.180]  and trying to press at that point temperature is all out of air i'm trying to you know get it to
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:40.420]  falling off all of that kind of shit you know but that's honestly how i started i mean doing
[02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:46.580]  something stupid like that to try to make it work so it took we all started with the hair straightener
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:52.260]  as far as i under when that the first yeah yeah but the hair straightener trying to get
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:56.340]  stepping on it and shit trying to get that pressure and shit your girl coming downstairs
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:10:00.420]  like what the hell are y'all doing you fucked up my hair press my hair straightener
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:08.260]  i see loyalty cannabis on there shout out to loyalty that dude is always helping out the show
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:16.020]  uh spot check news how much is oklahoma licensing and do they have a minority equity program
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:19.700]  i wish we had a minority equity program
[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:25.380]  no this is oklahoma man if you're gonna do something you better do it that's all it is
[02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:34.180]  to it we in in oklahoma man we don't really deal with excuses i mean it ain't nothing different for
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:39.220]  me than anybody else anybody out here has the opportunity to be able to get into this industry
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:45.220]  and go as far as they want to it's all depending on if you got the worth ethic in the drive i mean
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:51.140]  if this is your passion nothing should be able to stop you from getting into this i mean it was one
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:55.860]  of those deals to where man i had a car detail business and i bred dogs and that's what i did
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:11:00.420]  for a living so whenever they said hey you can grow weed and you can make some money sign me up
[02:11:00.420 --> 02:11:06.580]  as a matter of fact i will become obsessed with it and and immerse myself into everything so i can
[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:12.740]  be the best at least that i can be i may not be the best for everybody else you know but my goal
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:20.020]  is not to be your your favorite grower i want to be your favorite grower processor all of that you
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:24.580]  know what i mean i want to be your favorite growers grower you know so and that's just for
[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:30.180]  me personally i'm not my i don't compare myself to what other people is doing i really really don't
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:35.780]  care because with this opportunity that we have here in oklahoma i'm able to do things the way
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:41.220]  that i want to do things and it may not be the way that you know other people do it but i can take
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:46.420]  those little gold nuggets that i learned on my own and put them together you know so being able to
[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:51.220]  have that trial and error and learn from those mistakes you're gonna be able to put you together
[02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:57.780]  you know a perfect you know setup for whatever it is that you want to do but um the prices are
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:04.580]  2,500 you got to pay for the oklahoma the obn license so you're roughly three thirty five
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:13.380]  hundred dollars um to actually get your licenses and once you go to that easy part then the good
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:22.260]  hard work starts but 3,500 you win the game hey uh lewis salazar wants to know um can you
[02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:30.500]  can y'all ask where his product is available here in oklahoma um we've got a few stores out here in
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:36.820]  oklahoma city we've got a few stores in tulsa here in oklahoma city um it's med shop 405
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:44.820]  um the herb apothecary grateful med um as well as if you guys got a dispensary you know that
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:49.460]  you'd like to talk to and see the products in there hey give them a call um one of the best
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:57.780]  dispensaries that i really like being in is higher health up and growth but opco and tulsa opco med
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:04.260]  they actually pride themselves on teaching the patients they're not a dispensary to where you
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:09.140]  just walk in they you ask for the highest tac content they give it to you and let you walk out
[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:13.860]  the door they actually will take time with each patient to tell them about the products tell them
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:18.740]  about the terpenes tell them about the benefits and how to be able to pay attention to what it
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:23.940]  is that they're smoking and stuff like that so dispensaries like that opco med check them out
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:29.620]  like not only do they have the products they were they are able to tell you just about everything
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:34.980]  that you need to know about the products because there are people actually take that um the class
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:42.740]  with dr regina nelson as well to be able to educate people so check out the dj galvez is the one uh
[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:48.820]  the brains behind doing all that kind of stuff at opco med so shout out to her yes definitely she
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:54.980]  works her ass off so you guys you guys in tulsa definitely go check out that place for sure all
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:59.380]  the dispensaries shouldn't have to go through that training of some kind because the ones i've
[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:05.780]  been in they don't know anything it's just it's it's ridiculous but anyway here nor there did you
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:14.740]  have any attorney's fees i saw that pop up in the um i did over it um i mean at the end of the day
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:20.820]  here in oklahoma the way that they got it set up i mean it's kind of it's straight to the point but
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:25.060]  it's not straight to the point we do got a lot of gray areas and the way that our laws and stuff
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:31.300]  is set up but me being by myself doing the business by myself i don't have to worry about a lot of
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:34.660]  other people or what it is that they want to say about what i'm doing and how i'm doing it and
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:40.100]  stuff like that i'm not i'm my boss you know what i mean so i don't necessarily need a lawyer to come
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:45.620]  up with me a contract for myself you know what i mean so i got lawyer fees you know with things
[02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:54.490]  like my land and stuff like that for my actual business no and how are you banking because i
[02:14:54.490 --> 02:15:01.610]  know banking has always been an issue or at least has been in the past i got nine big-ass dogs
[02:15:04.490 --> 02:15:09.210]  so your cash business is that what you're saying it is i mean oklahoma you gotta do cash we got a
[02:15:09.210 --> 02:15:14.490]  couple banks now right now that say um you can do banking but the deal about this is and i mean this
[02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:21.290]  is funny but it's true so i don't know exactly how it is um with the i'm sorry somebody said they
[02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:26.250]  spent five thousand dollars in the turnip feeds setting up the loc i mean it's oklahoma you can go
[02:15:26.250 --> 02:15:33.930]  online and you can do the loc online um the um filling out the application is pretty straightforward
[02:15:33.930 --> 02:15:37.610]  i mean they give you all the help and information that you need if anybody needs help with you know
[02:15:37.610 --> 02:15:41.770]  if you really are trying to get into the industry and trying to do the license and stuff give me a
[02:15:41.770 --> 02:15:46.890]  shout out man i mean the the licensing is really not that hard i mean it tells you what to do so
[02:15:47.530 --> 02:15:51.770]  as long as you pay attention and don't you know mess it up it's really not that hard
[02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:54.970]  check all the boxes make sure you got everything you know the right way and you're good
[02:15:56.650 --> 02:16:05.050]  but uh the banking here a lot of them is um not fbic um secure so basically what that means is
[02:16:05.050 --> 02:16:09.690]  if the bank got robbed there is no government agency that's going to make sure that you have
[02:16:09.690 --> 02:16:14.170]  your money so my thought process was i might as well start a bank and all the marijuana grows in
[02:16:14.170 --> 02:16:22.650]  there and didn't rob himself if only you could start your own bank don't laugh i know a guy that
[02:16:22.650 --> 02:16:27.370]  did start his own bank he and three of his partners and that's how you do it dude it was
[02:16:27.370 --> 02:16:34.010]  fucking scary i mean i'm like what the fuck are you guys doing and playing these games and you
[02:16:34.010 --> 02:16:42.810]  know taking money in the back and laundering it and crazy shit it's crazy shit but um
[02:16:46.850 --> 02:16:52.850]  see that from our shout out you can uh you can go in there you can change it um i think my
[02:16:52.850 --> 02:17:03.410]  temperature settings i keep it 35 40 degrees and then my cycle times are 11 and 9 so it depends
[02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:08.130]  on your freezer and what setup that you have if you have the um pharmaceutical size or the home
[02:17:08.130 --> 02:17:12.850]  size or whatever there's different settings that you can go on there and um you can go and change
[02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:17.490]  those on there so that's one of the things you got to kind of play around with um there are videos
[02:17:17.490 --> 02:17:22.770]  on low 10 planks shout out low tip planks those people were really great to work with um they are
[02:17:22.770 --> 02:17:28.850]  the ones who got me my press they made me actual custom press for what it is that i have um you can
[02:17:28.850 --> 02:17:34.770]  check out their instagram and they do have some informational videos on how to use your harvest
[02:17:34.770 --> 02:17:43.390]  press or your freeze dryer a couple people wanted to know your instagram again buddy
[02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:50.510]  instagram medicine grower with bullies you can see there and then terry hayes collective is where a
[02:17:50.510 --> 02:18:00.800]  lot of the processing is uh bradley was saying damn that's cheap and i agree i feel like that's
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:06.960]  why you saw a ton of people move to oklahoma or try to make it in oklahoma um and a lot of people
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:12.880]  failed so you know congrats to you for not only learning this but learning business and the legal
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:19.760]  aspect of things is the nightmare yeah for sure i mean it's it's definitely one of those things to
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:26.080]  where like i say i ran a couple businesses before so i at least had a business background to at least
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:33.920]  be able to start this you know um it's one of those deals to where like i say me doing it by
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:38.640]  myself made it to where i didn't have to have a whole lot of liability dealing with other people
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:45.840]  i did start um with one company and that company went for what me and one other person and then
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:49.760]  they wanted to add three other people into the group so all of a sudden there's five people
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:55.120]  and then one falls off and the other one falls off and eventually i was like nope i can go do
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:59.920]  this by myself i think that's the smart way to go when i got into this industry man i'm not gonna
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:07.120]  lie to you my i didn't have the longevity i didn't think that i would be able to compete with these
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:11.600]  million dollar companies and stuff so i ain't gonna lie to you my goal was to get in like a
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:17.600]  lot of people did make me a little bit of money and didn't get out but i was decent at it i did
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:23.040]  good with it so therefore i'm my goal now to stay in the industry and stay relevant as long as i can
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:31.360]  i think you're doing it by making craft and again i think that that is in the end going to be similar
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:37.120]  to the craft beer market which just exploded if you look back at it and so you know yeah these
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:42.560]  guys can produce these mids but as the clients or customers get more educated they're not going to
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:50.480]  want that stuff you know so growing organically and making really clean products is the future for
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:55.680]  providing the onslaught of you know big business coming in and trying to take the f**k over
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:03.600]  yeah definitely i mean i think the quality of product that you have definitely is going to
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:07.360]  matter and stand out i mean a lot of these big companies they're running for the money they don't
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:11.280]  care about the people i mean that's what they're supposed to be they're a big company like that
[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:15.760]  they they are in it for the money i can't knock them for that that's the reason why they got in
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:21.040]  there but me personally i believe that money will come let me tell you right now i'm broke
[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:24.960]  so you're talking about banks and stuff hell i don't need no bank right now
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:33.600]  no i think that's i think those are wise words if you are really passionate you put your love and
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:39.520]  your energy and i mean all in the money will f**king come you just have to be patient and not
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:45.120]  be demanding and expect it to come tomorrow so kudos to you for understanding that principle
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:51.040]  and then bringing it up i think it's important yeah terry's collective and terry's farms owe
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:53.920]  me a fat-ass check that i have yet to get so
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:06.960]  cool are there any other collection uh questions what is what is a hayes collective carlos escobar
[02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:13.520]  asked oh hey so i started out like i said with terry's bullies and then i got terry's farm and so
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.480]  terry hayes collective was just the collective of terry's farms and the processing but
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:21.840]  the acronym is thc terry hayes collective so that was one reason
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:30.080]  have you uh done any rudimentary uh washes or something like that i saw a question like that
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:38.480]  up there yeah kind of in a sense you know involved got a bucket and smaller wash bags and stuff like
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:44.240]  that um doing things like that's what you i mean pretty much what you have to have in doing bubble
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:50.240]  hash you can do the old school hashish and if you look up some of theirs uh land races and stuff
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:54.400]  like that they take like basically a bed sheet and they will take the whole plant once it's dry
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:59.760]  and bang it on the bed sheet and collect the trichomes out that way roll it into a temple
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:05.600]  ball and that's me that's your afghani hash right there is how they make that so i've done things
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:10.000]  like that but if you're you know trying to make bubble hash and stuff like that there's a certain
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.160]  way that you have to do it using the bags and the ice and water and stuff like that
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:25.360]  right on i think those are if you got any other questions well do you want to do you want to end
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:28.960]  on uh doe hold on a second
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:31.040]  i'm gonna go ahead and do it again
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:36.240]  let me all right tell me if no we lost our leader

[02:28:51.930 --> 02:28:58.890]  got lit up like a christmas tree and you wouldn't expect that from cbd but i believe there's some cbg

[02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:16.070]  um chad sunday james will uh i believe most likely do something uh we we did an impromptu
[02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:22.710]  one last week or last sunday he was down in la but uh i like the backyard
[02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:29.770]  i like the backyard can you give us a quick little tour of the backyard
[02:34:30.890 --> 02:34:38.010]  can you hear us oh hell it looks terrible right now but you can see processing building
[02:34:38.890 --> 02:34:43.610]  there's greenhouses there's apple trees
[02:34:44.570 --> 02:34:49.770]  greenhouses all of that stuff where's your compost pile
[02:34:53.290 --> 02:35:01.050]  over here there's a compost pile over there man uh it's got right now we're still cooking so it's
[02:35:01.050 --> 02:35:08.330]  uh under the tarp and stuff okay got it all cooking and everything you're using your uh
[02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:15.690]  leftover cannabis plants yes actually i'm see if i can show you over here um yeah i'll take my
[02:35:15.690 --> 02:35:21.450]  plants um some that i decided not to grow anymore or plants that i cut down and yeah i'll take and
[02:35:21.450 --> 02:35:27.450]  i'll compost all of those again so this was a little indoor run that i did but you can see like
[02:35:28.410 --> 02:35:33.930]  there there was the plants there's the stems and you can see there's literally eggshells there's
[02:35:33.930 --> 02:35:42.310]  oranges there's stuff like that um now what do you do with your wash water do you use that to
[02:35:42.310 --> 02:35:48.550]  water your plants you got stuff over here you know yes um you can you can use that water to
[02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:54.710]  actually water your plants there's no point in wasting it the setup that i have is i have a drain
[02:35:55.270 --> 02:36:02.230]  that actually goes outside and i'm able to collect it um the next step is actually to
[02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:10.710]  have a reservoir so when i can actually pump it into my greenhouses nice nice i don't have
[02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:17.830]  much service inside of this building so i gotta kind of stand out a little bit but
[02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:26.550]  you can kind of see my setup the sink i've got the drain the washer freeze dryer the
[02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:30.950]  refrigerator is right next to it that way i can go straight from the wash straight to the
[02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:39.430]  freeze dryer i mean straight to the refrigerator so my setup is where it is small quarters for a
[02:36:39.430 --> 02:36:44.950]  purpose to be able to quickly move from the freezer to the washer to the refrigerator back
[02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:51.750]  to the freezer uh straight over to the freeze dryer so i don't have a lot of room to make
[02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:57.590]  human mistakes i mean i've and i've seen somebody washing man and they fucking tripped and
[02:36:57.590 --> 02:37:03.190]  dropped the whole fucking tray on the ground you know you talking about man that hurt you know so
[02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:10.550]  my setup is that way to avoid stupid stuff like that right keep it small keep it tight and plus
[02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:17.270]  it's easier to keep the whole room cool yep keep it cool and keep it clean yep whenever i um so
[02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:21.350]  this building here was like a shell of a building like that's one thing about being in this industry
[02:37:21.350 --> 02:37:26.070]  man not only do i grow in process man i have become a construction worker and an electrician
[02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:33.270]  an air conditioner h back person man i can i can do all of it now you know so this building was a
[02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:38.870]  shell of a building it was just a metal frame and i actually went in and turned power off at the pole
[02:37:39.430 --> 02:37:44.470]  ran power over to the building wired everything up i did the installation i did the sheet rock i did
[02:37:44.470 --> 02:37:51.270]  the mud and taping um painted it i did the floor i literally did everything in that building good

[02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:06.550]  the the chance to be able to do this to be able to educate people um especially with my products
[02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:11.910]  and stuff like that um it is hard in this market because people really don't even know what the
[02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:19.830]  product is so educating them helps the patients out as well as it helps me out and getting that
[02:39:20.470 --> 02:39:25.350]  education is one of the goals that i'm trying to do i want everybody to know what hash rosen is
[02:39:25.350 --> 02:39:29.990]  that way they will have the choices and the options on how they want to medicate

[02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:43.510]  this product you know well that's something too i feel like uh some of those companies think that
[02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:48.230]  they're going to do an event or two and really get it out there i see you hustling at a bunch
[02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:53.910]  of events um that's really what it takes to build your brand uh is being out there and being in the
[02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:58.310]  you know that you're kind of in the trenches i see you going from you know it seems like major
[02:39:58.310 --> 02:40:03.750]  events to even like maybe just really small rural oklahoma events uh but that's what it really takes
