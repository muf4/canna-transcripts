[00:00.000 --> 00:10.700]  Hello everybody! We are live at Cannabis for Breakfast as usual. It is London here in the garden with very special guests visiting today.
[00:10.700 --> 00:18.400]  We have Dave Rowe of Clonetics visiting us and Stew Farms, Natasha. I'm excited. We're going to get into the conversation shortly.
[00:18.400 --> 00:24.700]  I'm looking forward to getting into it, but before we get started, a special shout out to our sponsor Green Amber.ca.
[00:25.700 --> 00:35.900]  They have amazing LED lighting that is built for high efficiency and great quality flowers. So make sure to check them out. We appreciate their support.
[00:35.900 --> 00:43.900]  I'd like to introduce everybody to our amazing group of conversations today, Natasha and David.
[00:43.900 --> 00:47.400]  David, do you want to introduce yourself and get it started and say hello?
[00:48.100 --> 00:55.600]  Absolutely. Thanks for having us, London. It's David Brough here from Clonetics, CEO and co-founder of the company.
[00:55.600 --> 01:06.100]  Clonetics has been around now for just over about three and a half years. We are one of the largest industrial scale providers of clones in Canada.
[01:06.100 --> 01:13.600]  We just recently expanded into the EU and are working on some international plans as well for further expansion.
[01:13.800 --> 01:19.800]  We're blessed to be able to work with people like Stew Farms to take our stuff and turn it into real flower.
[01:19.800 --> 01:22.800]  Super excited to be here. Thanks very much for having us.
[01:26.970 --> 01:34.970]  Awesome. I'm just resharing this into our group on Facebook. We have an artisanal cannabis cultivators group.
[01:34.970 --> 01:38.970]  It's something we're affiliated with and we have about 15K members in there.
[01:38.970 --> 01:41.470]  I wanted to make sure that they were getting it live and coming in.
[01:41.670 --> 01:46.670]  Natasha, do you want to say hello? We'll get into some of the questions about you and your businesses.
[01:46.670 --> 01:54.670]  We're going to have a tour of Natasha's facility. She is running Blimburn's Grim Blue sourced by Clonetics.
[01:54.670 --> 01:58.670]  We're excited to see the plant at all stages. We're going to get a lot of awesome stuff going in.
[01:58.670 --> 02:02.670]  After that, we're going to check out Clonetics' facility. I think it's going to be very interesting,
[02:02.670 --> 02:08.670]  especially because we have a mixed ratio of audience. A lot of Americans, some international guests, but a lot of Canadians as well.
[02:08.870 --> 02:14.870]  I'm really excited to show what's coming out of the nurseries and what's happening in this legal environment
[02:14.870 --> 02:19.870]  and how you guys are really highlighting the OGs, the cooler breeders in the market.
[02:19.870 --> 02:25.870]  There's some exciting stuff coming up. Natasha, do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself?
[02:25.870 --> 02:32.870]  Hey, I'm from Stew Farms. My husband and I own Stew Farms. We have a micro cultivation license.
[02:33.070 --> 02:40.070]  We get to grow craft cannabis and we're excited with Clonetics' Grim Blue.
[02:40.070 --> 02:45.070]  Our first round and second round looked phenomenal. I'm excited to tour you guys.
[02:45.070 --> 02:52.070]  We have the plant in every stage right now, from baby, toddler, teen and adult, as I call it.
[02:52.070 --> 03:01.070]  It's exciting. I'm really excited to show you all the plants. They look really happy. You'll be impressed.
[03:03.070 --> 03:10.070]  I'm super excited. Now, David, Clonetics is a bit different. You guys are a large facility,
[03:10.070 --> 03:15.070]  but I think you guys are doing something completely different than anybody else when it comes to the space.
[03:15.070 --> 03:23.070]  We're all, as a community of craft growers and passionate advocates, we've got a lot of activism and a lot of activists
[03:23.070 --> 03:28.070]  and a lot of people anti big corporate business and pro small business.
[03:28.070 --> 03:32.070]  But you guys are doing something different in respecting those smaller businesses and helping them grow and develop.
[03:32.270 --> 03:34.270]  Can you talk a little bit about that? I'd love to hear about it.
[03:35.270 --> 03:43.270]  I really appreciate you pointing that out. One of the biggest things about Clonetics is we hear about the legacy market.
[03:43.270 --> 03:51.270]  None of us are on this link without the legacy market. The guys who came before us, the guys and women who came before us,
[03:51.270 --> 03:54.270]  the hard work they did and frankly, the risk that they took.
[03:54.470 --> 04:02.470]  One of the things that's really unique about Clonetics is the fact that we are so deeply rooted from the legacy market,
[04:02.470 --> 04:08.470]  but so entrenched in science here. When I first decided to build this company,
[04:08.470 --> 04:13.470]  we started looking at the different genetics that were available out there in the marketplace
[04:13.470 --> 04:17.470]  and realized that there was a lot of different players with genetics.
[04:17.670 --> 04:21.670]  We actually started off looking at the ACMPR market and growing from there.
[04:21.670 --> 04:24.670]  We had a couple of those locations when we first started as well.
[04:25.670 --> 04:30.670]  What we really decided to do was to make sure that the actual breeders got protected.
[04:31.670 --> 04:37.670]  Over a two and a half year period, we went around the world and cut exclusive deals with the physical breeders themselves.
[04:37.670 --> 04:43.670]  The original guys behind the actual cuts that you see in our catalog now.
[04:43.870 --> 04:49.870]  We have 12 of the biggest breeders names in the world that actually are part of the company.
[04:49.870 --> 04:55.870]  These guys are shareholders. They are actually part of our breeding programs, our science programs.
[04:55.870 --> 05:00.870]  What you're looking at right now, where the cash is growing is from Brothers Grimm.
[05:00.870 --> 05:02.870]  A lot of people have heard of Brothers Grimm.
[05:02.870 --> 05:09.870]  A lot of people will see different things going on in the industry where people talk about that they have cuts from Brothers Grimm
[05:09.870 --> 05:10.870]  or they have cuts from different people.
[05:11.070 --> 05:16.070]  By working with clone addicts, you're actually working with Rick from Brothers Grimm.
[05:16.070 --> 05:18.070]  That's a big difference.
[05:18.070 --> 05:23.070]  You have the ability to actually reach out and have a conversation with him and to learn some more.
[05:24.070 --> 05:30.070]  The other thing that really happens on behalf of the breeders is we actually protect the breeders.
[05:30.070 --> 05:39.070]  We protect their licenses. We protect their actual cultivars, the cultivar names, the actual brands, the logos, all that kind of stuff.
[05:39.270 --> 05:47.270]  That really gives you, the consumer or the grower, the absolute confidence that if I say you're getting Grimm Blue from Rick,
[05:47.270 --> 05:50.270]  you're getting Grimm Blue from Rick.
[05:50.270 --> 05:53.270]  It's not a cut that we got out in the market someplace.
[05:53.270 --> 05:57.270]  It's not something that we sourced through a seed show or that we got through the mail.
[05:57.270 --> 06:01.270]  This is the physical cut that we personally were handed by Rick.
[06:01.270 --> 06:02.270]  This is a huge thing.
[06:02.270 --> 06:05.270]  You're looking at icons in the industry like Karma Genetics.
[06:05.470 --> 06:13.470]  Karma Genetics is an absolute icon out of the Netherlands and was one of the first people to actually get on board with clone addicts and sign up with us.
[06:14.470 --> 06:19.470]  We're working with these guys in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and into the European Union.
[06:19.470 --> 06:27.470]  Just recently, Spanibus, huge winner in Spanibus, 33% THC cultivar through Requiem.
[06:27.470 --> 06:30.470]  Again, Requiem is one of our actual partners.
[06:30.670 --> 06:33.670]  That cut's about to come out.
[06:33.670 --> 06:36.670]  Natasha will be one of the first ones to get her hands on it.
[06:36.670 --> 06:39.670]  It's going to be very cool and it's going to take this market by storm.
[06:39.670 --> 06:44.670]  You can see the actual, I guess it's this way, you can see that poster behind me.
[06:44.670 --> 06:46.670]  That's THC.
[06:46.670 --> 06:50.670]  THC has some of the coolest stuff in the marketplace right now throughout the world.
[06:50.670 --> 06:52.670]  We just did a cultivar of THC.
[06:52.670 --> 06:58.670]  It's 28.1% THC, 5% CBD, and 3.7% terps.
[06:58.870 --> 07:05.870]  This is going to be a rocket ship for our growers and something that's actually going to help them take market share.
[07:05.870 --> 07:10.870]  Again, all the brands, logos, cultivars, cultivar names, and all that are protected here in Canada.
[07:10.870 --> 07:15.870]  The stuff that you see come out of us is actually exclusive to us.
[07:15.870 --> 07:20.870]  That's another big thing when growers and craft companies want to get out there and take market share.
[07:21.070 --> 07:29.070]  One of the issues is if somebody down the street can grow the same cut as you, it's really hard to take that market share.
[07:29.070 --> 07:35.070]  With Clonetics, because of the way we're structured with our breeders, we can actually give somebody the exclusive rights to grow something.
[07:35.070 --> 07:43.070]  Which is probably a great time to just announce right now that the team at Stew Farms and their partner facility, Wayne Patrick,
[07:43.070 --> 07:48.070]  will be exclusively carrying on the store shelves the Brothers Grimm brand.
[07:48.270 --> 07:56.270]  This is going to be one of the first and only actual breeders' brands sitting on the store shelf here in Canada.
[07:56.270 --> 07:59.270]  This is a huge thing for all of us.
[07:59.270 --> 08:08.270]  It's actually going to start to allow the actual breeders to have their stuff on retail store shelves and get that market share themselves.
[08:08.270 --> 08:10.270]  You just got me excited.
[08:10.270 --> 08:13.270]  Now I have tons of energy.
[08:13.270 --> 08:16.270]  This is one of the things that's driven me freaking nuts.
[08:16.470 --> 08:19.470]  There's two rules that I make for everybody.
[08:19.470 --> 08:24.470]  If anybody ever asks, I'm going to go buy product in the industry or in the Canadian recreational market.
[08:24.470 --> 08:26.470]  If it's not going to be legacy, it's not going to be any of that.
[08:26.470 --> 08:32.470]  If you're going to go to the store and buy one, buy something from a farm and try a few different farms.
[08:32.470 --> 08:35.470]  When you find a farm that you really enjoy, keep purchasing from them.
[08:35.470 --> 08:42.470]  A lot of the problem that everybody hears about are numbers and the levels of THC and hitting those higher numbers
[08:42.670 --> 08:48.670]  and having something in your portfolio that you're putting out for those numbers I think is important.
[08:48.670 --> 08:54.670]  Having other items that have all the other flavors and abilities, they don't need to be at the higher percentage.
[08:54.670 --> 09:02.670]  Getting that first client in the door, I hate the word client, getting that first time buyer of your farm in the door is so important.
[09:02.670 --> 09:07.670]  One of the biggest things that we all love and that we're passionate about as cannabis people is the breeders.
[09:07.870 --> 09:11.870]  We have multiple breeder shows throughout the week.
[09:11.870 --> 09:13.870]  We have guests, we have seeds.
[09:13.870 --> 09:15.870]  It's a huge part of our community.
[09:15.870 --> 09:24.870]  Frankly, I thought it was ridiculous that we haven't had the opportunity to be able to see and highlight the breeders here in BC, Canada
[09:24.870 --> 09:30.870]  or in Canada period or talk about where the breeders got having that certified.
[09:30.870 --> 09:32.870]  That is just ridiculously exciting.
[09:33.070 --> 09:37.070]  Natasha, could you jump into a little bit about what it's like?
[09:37.070 --> 09:43.070]  You've got to meet Rick from Blimburn Seeds and got to grow the Gorilla Glue.
[09:43.070 --> 09:45.070]  Do you want to chat a little bit about that?
[09:45.070 --> 09:52.070]  Then I'd love to ask a little bit more about the BC and Canadian breeders that you have on the market.
[09:52.070 --> 09:54.070]  Talk a little bit about the international.
[09:54.070 --> 09:56.070]  I love hearing about local.
[09:56.070 --> 09:59.070]  That's a big fan of me, but we'll start with that.
[09:59.270 --> 10:02.270]  I've chatted a little bit with Brothers Grimm.
[10:02.270 --> 10:06.270]  I haven't met anybody yet, but we chatted for a little while.
[10:06.270 --> 10:07.270]  They're great.
[10:07.270 --> 10:13.270]  I'm just getting some tips and tricks about what the plant likes, how the strain grows.
[10:13.270 --> 10:24.270]  So far, we've just spoken to them for a little bit, but I just want to dial in this Grimm Glue because I think it has so much potential.
[10:24.270 --> 10:26.270]  We've spoken a little bit.
[10:26.470 --> 10:27.470]  Awesome.
[10:27.470 --> 10:30.470]  There's a couple of things being brought up in chat.
[10:30.470 --> 10:33.470]  We'll chat about some of the BC breeders as well.
[10:33.470 --> 10:39.470]  What you mentioned, and I want to make sure that we touch on this concept and drill it down pretty hard, David,
[10:39.470 --> 10:44.470]  is that the genetics that the breeders bring in with you guys, the clonetics and stuff like that,
[10:44.470 --> 10:45.470]  that's theirs and yours.
[10:45.470 --> 10:46.470]  They're shareholders.
[10:46.470 --> 10:48.470]  Everybody owns that.
[10:48.470 --> 10:50.470]  They're not excluded.
[10:50.470 --> 10:52.470]  You're not excluding the breeders.
[10:52.470 --> 10:54.470]  You're not taking away the breeders.
[10:54.670 --> 10:55.670]  You're not excluding the breeders.
[10:55.670 --> 11:01.670]  You're not taking it and buying it and keeping it to yourself unless that's what they want to do.
[11:01.670 --> 11:09.670]  But I think that if you could touch on how that works a little bit, just so that there's clarity, if you're able to dive into it.
[11:09.670 --> 11:10.670]  Yeah.
[11:10.670 --> 11:11.670]  No, 100%.
[11:11.670 --> 11:15.670]  That was the whole thought process when we decided to build a business model that we did.
[11:15.670 --> 11:19.670]  We've heard all kinds of different structures and stuff out there.
[11:19.870 --> 11:24.870]  Even if you said your stuff can be cleaned up by some nurseries, for some reason they get to keep your cuts.
[11:24.870 --> 11:25.870]  It just makes no sense to me at all.
[11:25.870 --> 11:32.870]  These are the products that people have grown and slaved over to kind of bring into the light here to grow.
[11:32.870 --> 11:36.870]  So, no, we are firmly behind our actual breeders.
[11:36.870 --> 11:43.870]  So to give you an example, we have four clinical trials happening in epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, and inflammation disease
[11:43.870 --> 11:46.870]  with cannabis right now through our university partners.
[11:47.070 --> 11:53.070]  Our breeders get 50% of any intellectual property that we get.
[11:53.070 --> 11:59.070]  So it doesn't matter if they get paid by the royalty for clone, they get paid by the clipping, they get paid by intellectual property.
[11:59.070 --> 12:09.070]  We absolutely make sure that people get the opportunity to share in every single thing we do here at Clonex.
[12:09.070 --> 12:13.070]  So I give you a perfect example when it comes to breeders' cuts.
[12:13.270 --> 12:17.270]  There was a study done at one of the major universities.
[12:17.270 --> 12:21.270]  I'll leave the university out of it and the name of the cut, but it was a world-famous cut.
[12:21.270 --> 12:23.270]  Everybody was growing it. Everybody was smoking it for years.
[12:23.270 --> 12:31.270]  They took 20 different samples out of the legacy market, 20 samples that they could get their hands on in the legal market,
[12:31.270 --> 12:36.270]  and they did a genomic mapping and testing against the actual original breeders' cut.
[12:36.270 --> 12:41.270]  80% of it was the wrong cut.
[12:41.470 --> 12:47.470]  So 80% of what they were growing and smoking wasn't even the right plant.
[12:47.470 --> 12:52.470]  It had been traded so many times throughout the years that people thought,
[12:52.470 --> 12:56.470]  hey, I've got this cut, and then trade it to their buddy and whatever.
[12:56.470 --> 13:01.470]  By the time it actually came out where it could be physically tested in math,
[13:01.470 --> 13:03.470]  it wasn't even the right stuff.
[13:03.470 --> 13:06.470]  Only 20% of all the cultivars were correct.
[13:06.470 --> 13:08.470]  The rest of them were incorrect.
[13:08.670 --> 13:15.670]  One of the things that we do is we certify everything that goes off to someone like Natasha.
[13:15.670 --> 13:19.670]  We actually give them a breeder-certified badge that they can put on the label.
[13:19.670 --> 13:21.670]  It says, this came from the breeder.
[13:21.670 --> 13:27.670]  That tells the consumer, hey, this is an actual product from that breeder.
[13:32.670 --> 13:35.670]  Breeding is a ridiculous amount of work.
[13:35.870 --> 13:40.870]  The amount of time, effort, planning all these plants, going through them, inspecting them.
[13:40.870 --> 13:43.870]  I get the opportunity to speak with quite a few breeders on a regular basis.
[13:43.870 --> 13:49.870]  The volume of work that it takes, and even the projects that they put on, could take their entire life.
[13:49.870 --> 13:55.870]  They could maybe never even complete some of these breeding projects that they truly want to do.
[13:55.870 --> 14:00.870]  Having the ability to do that is so critical and so important for these people.
[14:01.070 --> 14:07.070]  Navigating this shit market that we have here in Canada with the legalities and all these other things
[14:07.070 --> 14:14.070]  are so cheap to add all of that extra work on top of just having to live and take care of yourself as a human being.
[14:14.070 --> 14:17.070]  It's way more than most people can handle.
[14:17.070 --> 14:19.070]  It's way more than most people can do.
[14:19.070 --> 14:23.070]  I think it's so important and valuable that these people's work is getting to market.
[14:23.070 --> 14:25.070]  It's going to help people.
[14:25.070 --> 14:29.070]  Actually help them in the long run, which is so awesome and important.
[14:29.270 --> 14:33.270]  We love hearing about the breeders.
[14:33.270 --> 14:34.270]  Bloomberg is really cool.
[14:34.270 --> 14:36.270]  What about the BC breeders?
[14:36.270 --> 14:43.270]  Who locally, who we know that's on the smaller end, that's the more niche guys?
[14:43.270 --> 14:46.270]  I think I've seen Breeder Steve in your work.
[14:46.270 --> 14:48.270]  Also, what's it like to work with them?
[14:48.270 --> 14:50.270]  You know what?
[14:50.270 --> 14:56.270]  To be honest with you, having Breeder Steve only eight minutes away from your facility is pretty amazing.
[14:56.470 --> 15:02.470]  We're able to sit down at the table here and enjoy our time with Steve.
[15:02.470 --> 15:04.470]  I'll just leave it at that.
[15:04.470 --> 15:09.470]  We're very blessed to have guys like Steve who come in and spend time with us.
[15:09.470 --> 15:13.470]  You brought up a great point about the THC.
[15:13.470 --> 15:19.470]  I can't wait until the world, the general buying public in the retail sector goes back to high terpenes
[15:19.470 --> 15:23.470]  and really gets into these 20% plants.
[15:23.470 --> 15:25.470]  You brought up Breeder Steve.
[15:25.670 --> 15:27.670]  A rich story, phenomenal human being.
[15:27.670 --> 15:33.670]  The stories that come out of Steve, you can just sit here for hours and listen to what he's done in his life.
[15:33.670 --> 15:35.670]  It is the coolest thing.
[15:35.670 --> 15:41.670]  When you look at, as an example, he grew around his pool something called a beaver's breath.
[15:41.670 --> 15:48.670]  The beaver's breath we had in our seeds in the catalog and that kind of stuff before we made our declaration.
[15:48.670 --> 15:52.670]  He grew this and ended up being 20%.
[15:52.870 --> 15:56.870]  It weathered this heat dome we had and the hazy smoke we had out here.
[15:56.870 --> 15:58.870]  It should have been dead 17 times.
[15:58.870 --> 16:01.870]  I have no idea.
[16:01.870 --> 16:04.870]  Only Steve could keep this alive next to his pool.
[16:04.870 --> 16:11.870]  When you look at what came out of there, the general, the BC liquor store was like,
[16:11.870 --> 16:13.870]  oh no, it's not high enough.
[16:13.870 --> 16:21.870]  Guys, it's 20% with 3.7 terps, but it had a very special high spike in one of the terpenes.
[16:22.070 --> 16:30.070]  When we got together, I ended up giving some of my friends some samples and stuff,
[16:30.070 --> 16:33.070]  just sitting around as friends to try.
[16:33.070 --> 16:36.070]  These guys have been smoking since they were 13.
[16:36.070 --> 16:38.070]  They're in their 50s.
[16:38.070 --> 16:40.070]  As you can tell, I'm old as heck.
[16:40.070 --> 16:45.070]  In their 50s, we were taking our kids to a corn maze for Halloween.
[16:45.070 --> 16:47.070]  I said, come on, I'll drive.
[16:47.070 --> 16:49.070]  I didn't take anything.
[16:49.070 --> 16:50.070]  I said, I'll drive.
[16:50.070 --> 16:51.070]  Let's take the kids to the corn maze.
[16:51.270 --> 16:54.270]  People said, no, we're just going to sit here for a minute because we're literally too high.
[16:56.270 --> 17:00.270]  That was a 20%er with some unique terpene profiles.
[17:00.270 --> 17:04.270]  This whole, it's got to be 50% THC thing.
[17:04.270 --> 17:09.270]  I think it's damaging the market, to be honest.
[17:09.270 --> 17:11.270]  I'm so happy you're saying that.
[17:11.270 --> 17:13.270]  I agree.
[17:13.270 --> 17:14.270]  Natasha, go ahead.
[17:14.270 --> 17:15.270]  Oh my God.
[17:15.270 --> 17:19.270]  Everyone in every store, you walk into an OCS store and everyone's like,
[17:19.470 --> 17:21.470]  what's your highest THC strain?
[17:21.470 --> 17:24.470]  Everything's sold out above 25%.
[17:24.470 --> 17:26.470]  No one wants to touch the 20%ers.
[17:26.470 --> 17:31.470]  I can't stress enough how important terpenes are because they regulate
[17:31.470 --> 17:34.470]  what kind of high you get, how high you get.
[17:34.470 --> 17:41.470]  It's such a different thing that people are not understanding.
[17:41.470 --> 17:43.470]  Terpenes are so important.
[17:43.470 --> 17:48.470]  You can have a bad experience because you had a certain kind of terpene
[17:48.670 --> 17:51.670]  in your cannabis that you smoked that day and you can smoke another strain
[17:51.670 --> 17:53.670]  and be totally amazing.
[17:53.670 --> 17:56.670]  It's so important to educate people on terpenes.
[17:59.670 --> 18:01.670]  It is critical.
[18:01.670 --> 18:04.670]  We chat a lot about that on my Dank Hour show in the evenings.
[18:04.670 --> 18:07.670]  It's huge and it's a changing market.
[18:07.670 --> 18:11.670]  We're running through these stressors as one of the first markets to become legal.
[18:11.670 --> 18:17.670]  Like we mentioned before, that's what people go into the shop buying.
[18:17.870 --> 18:21.870]  That's their mentality, whether we like it or believe in it or not.
[18:21.870 --> 18:23.870]  It's that key factor.
[18:23.870 --> 18:26.870]  Let's get them to try the first product and then try every other product
[18:26.870 --> 18:29.870]  of that farm if you like that.
[18:29.870 --> 18:31.870]  That way you get into it.
[18:31.870 --> 18:34.870]  On top of this, the extra level that you're giving us,
[18:34.870 --> 18:39.870]  not only that but let's try the breeder and make sure I have the certified breeder cup.
[18:39.870 --> 18:43.870]  I do a show on our evening show with Dr. Anubis,
[18:43.870 --> 18:45.870]  which you guys will actually be guests on as well.
[18:46.070 --> 18:48.070]  She's a cannabis geneticist.
[18:48.070 --> 18:52.070]  She wrote a white paper and did exactly the same thing.
[18:52.070 --> 18:56.070]  Sourced genetics from all sorts of dispensaries from all over the place.
[18:56.070 --> 19:00.070]  The consistencies were so vast it was ridiculous.
[19:00.070 --> 19:04.070]  The only things that had any sort of relative relational consistencies
[19:04.070 --> 19:07.070]  are things with dog that were based off a chem dog.
[19:07.070 --> 19:10.070]  I think maybe there's more dominancy in the trace.
[19:10.270 --> 19:14.270]  It was almost shocking where she was
[19:14.270 --> 19:17.270]  and the way that she did not be able to identify it.
[19:17.270 --> 19:21.270]  The problem for her as a scientist looking at this from a university
[19:21.270 --> 19:26.270]  and getting into this is it looks like nobody's got any consistency anywhere.
[19:26.270 --> 19:28.270]  It's all bullshit. It's all over the place.
[19:28.270 --> 19:30.270]  But there are people with consistency.
[19:30.270 --> 19:32.270]  There are people providing these genetic cuts
[19:32.270 --> 19:36.270]  and they're being passed around as asexually reproduced organisms.
[19:36.270 --> 19:38.270]  There are other things happening.
[19:38.470 --> 19:40.470]  There are other makers doing this stuff and creating more consistent work.
[19:40.470 --> 19:44.470]  But we have things like these larger seed brands in Canada
[19:44.470 --> 19:48.470]  that produce all of the elite stuff every year
[19:48.470 --> 19:51.470]  before the seeds hit the market for some reason.
[19:51.470 --> 19:54.470]  None of it and all of it kind of looks the same.
[19:54.470 --> 19:58.470]  It kind of creates this blandness of the industry.
[19:58.470 --> 20:00.470]  One of the big things that's frustrating is
[20:00.470 --> 20:02.470]  you can find the certified seeds from certain sources
[20:02.470 --> 20:05.470]  but there are people that are not providing that service.
[20:05.670 --> 20:10.670]  Being able to get the cut and the breed from someone directly
[20:10.670 --> 20:14.670]  at that level and that you can trace back
[20:14.670 --> 20:18.670]  is so important for an industry moving forward period.
[20:18.670 --> 20:26.670]  You can't grow Sangiovese grape wine without Sangiovese grape.
[20:26.670 --> 20:28.670]  It's just not possible.
[20:28.670 --> 20:30.670]  How do you do it? How do you move it forward?
[20:30.670 --> 20:32.670]  I think this is one of the ways to do it.
[20:32.670 --> 20:34.670]  I think you're doing something really cool.
[20:34.870 --> 20:38.870]  I want to get this in now too
[20:38.870 --> 20:40.870]  because you have something really interesting coming up
[20:40.870 --> 20:42.870]  as a podcast, do you not?
[20:42.870 --> 20:44.870]  You guys are doing a podcast show coming up
[20:44.870 --> 20:46.870]  highlighting a lot of your breeders.
[20:46.870 --> 20:49.870]  Yeah, actually we have a very cool podcast coming up
[20:49.870 --> 20:51.870]  called the Breeders' Cut.
[20:51.870 --> 20:53.870]  The Breeders' Cut is strictly just breeders.
[20:53.870 --> 20:56.870]  It's going to be our breeders and other breeders
[20:56.870 --> 20:59.870]  that either they work with or mentor
[20:59.870 --> 21:02.870]  or like you say, legacy breeders who are in the market
[21:03.070 --> 21:05.070]  and want to come on and talk about it.
[21:05.070 --> 21:08.070]  The Breeders' Cut is going to allow people to come in
[21:08.070 --> 21:11.070]  and actually ask the breeders of your favorite cuts
[21:11.070 --> 21:13.070]  how did you grow it? How did it come about?
[21:13.070 --> 21:15.070]  Where did you collect those seeds?
[21:15.070 --> 21:17.070]  Well, as much as I'll be able to tell you, I suppose.
[21:17.070 --> 21:23.070]  The exciting stuff and the history and the stories
[21:23.070 --> 21:27.070]  behind some of these things and how they've come about.
[21:27.070 --> 21:31.070]  When you look at access to the breeders themselves
[21:31.270 --> 21:34.270]  it's huge. It's absolutely a game changer.
[21:34.270 --> 21:37.270]  To give you an example, one of the really cool
[21:37.270 --> 21:40.270]  unique things that we have in-house here
[21:40.270 --> 21:44.270]  is we have a land race program with 150 land races in it.
[21:44.270 --> 21:47.270]  Now these are true land races with full provenance
[21:47.270 --> 21:52.270]  like video, pictures, latitude, longitude, descriptions.
[21:52.270 --> 21:55.270]  I've got a book that probably wouldn't show very well
[21:55.270 --> 21:59.270]  on your screen here, but I've got a whole book
[21:59.470 --> 22:02.470]  on the Afghan lines of Duran that we did.
[22:02.470 --> 22:06.470]  We've got a really cool set of cuts out of Africa
[22:06.470 --> 22:10.470]  where we had to discover and work through this
[22:10.470 --> 22:14.470]  one seed collector who had to get permission
[22:14.470 --> 22:17.470]  from the Zulu nation to bring out three different cuts
[22:17.470 --> 22:20.470]  out of Africa because according to legend
[22:20.470 --> 22:22.470]  they date back to the Zulu kings.
[22:22.470 --> 22:25.470]  So, you know, it's really some...
[22:25.470 --> 22:26.470]  That's fucking epic.
[22:26.670 --> 22:27.670]  Yes, there is some...
[22:27.670 --> 22:32.670]  That library downstairs is so deep and so historic
[22:32.670 --> 22:35.670]  that we'll be breeding for the next 20 years
[22:35.670 --> 22:36.670]  and never cross anything twice.
[22:36.670 --> 22:38.670]  It's going to be super cool.
[22:38.670 --> 22:42.670]  The other thing that's coming is now that our TC Lab
[22:42.670 --> 22:45.670]  is up and moving, we opened here in December,
[22:45.670 --> 22:48.670]  all the guys who are in the craft industry,
[22:48.670 --> 22:52.670]  all the teams, people like Natasha,
[22:52.670 --> 22:55.670]  you can bring your cuts to us.
[22:55.870 --> 22:58.870]  We clean them up, we biobank them for you
[22:58.870 --> 23:01.870]  and then we give you an opportunity to sell them
[23:01.870 --> 23:04.870]  in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe
[23:04.870 --> 23:07.870]  so you can create streams of revenue
[23:07.870 --> 23:10.870]  for the craft growers by saying,
[23:10.870 --> 23:12.870]  hey, if you've got an amazing cut
[23:12.870 --> 23:14.870]  that you want to get into the marketplace,
[23:14.870 --> 23:15.870]  bring it to us.
[23:15.870 --> 23:17.870]  We don't own it, you own it.
[23:17.870 --> 23:19.870]  We don't take markers of it,
[23:19.870 --> 23:20.870]  we don't do any of that kind of stuff.
[23:20.870 --> 23:23.870]  We simply facilitate getting it into the market for you
[23:24.070 --> 23:26.070]  and then we make it so you get paid
[23:26.070 --> 23:28.070]  on every cut that goes out the door.
[23:28.070 --> 23:32.070]  We really are set up to work with everybody
[23:32.070 --> 23:33.070]  across the board.
[23:33.070 --> 23:35.070]  That's pretty awesome.
[23:35.070 --> 23:39.070]  I know the most passionate growers in the community
[23:39.070 --> 23:40.070]  are the home growers.
[23:40.070 --> 23:43.070]  They're the people that help drive the industry
[23:43.070 --> 23:47.070]  and change the home growers that were legacy
[23:47.070 --> 23:50.070]  and now are maybe a little bit more hobby style.
[23:50.070 --> 23:52.070]  It's a challenge and people want to focus
[23:52.070 --> 23:53.070]  on what they want to do
[23:53.270 --> 23:54.270]  and I think that's really awesome
[23:54.270 --> 23:55.270]  and respectful to them.
[23:55.270 --> 23:57.270]  Before we get into,
[23:57.270 --> 23:59.270]  because I'm sure people are going to start getting
[23:59.270 --> 24:01.270]  asking to see some plants here pretty soon.
[24:01.270 --> 24:02.270]  Before we get into that,
[24:02.270 --> 24:03.270]  I'd like to ask,
[24:03.270 --> 24:06.270]  A, do we get to see the library at some point today?
[24:06.270 --> 24:09.270]  And then B, the other question is,
[24:09.270 --> 24:11.270]  I'd like to know your opinion a little bit
[24:11.270 --> 24:12.270]  on genetic stability.
[24:12.270 --> 24:14.270]  And by genetic stability,
[24:14.270 --> 24:15.270]  what I mean is,
[24:15.270 --> 24:19.270]  I really enjoy getting a pack of seeds.
[24:19.270 --> 24:21.270]  I've just done a cross right now
[24:21.470 --> 24:22.470]  with Acapulco Gold,
[24:22.470 --> 24:23.470]  Landrace,
[24:23.470 --> 24:26.470]  I'm not necessarily liking the term Landrace recently
[24:26.470 --> 24:28.470]  so I'm using the term heirloom variety.
[24:28.470 --> 24:29.470]  Heirloom variety of Acapulco Gold,
[24:29.470 --> 24:32.470]  very true to its shape, form and structure
[24:32.470 --> 24:33.470]  and Lemoncush Headband,
[24:33.470 --> 24:37.470]  which is more of a polyhybridized plant.
[24:37.470 --> 24:38.470]  Taking those two together
[24:38.470 --> 24:41.470]  and you get a lot more variety in that pack of seed.
[24:41.470 --> 24:43.470]  Now, if you're looking at breeding consistency
[24:43.470 --> 24:45.470]  and creating an inbred line,
[24:45.470 --> 24:47.470]  that's not what a lot of people's goal is.
[24:47.470 --> 24:48.470]  But that being said,
[24:48.670 --> 24:51.670]  you don't get as much fun to play with
[24:51.670 --> 24:53.670]  in a bag of seeds
[24:53.670 --> 24:55.670]  when it's got no variability in it at all.
[24:55.670 --> 24:56.670]  It's very consistent.
[24:56.670 --> 24:58.670]  But if we're looking at cultivars
[24:58.670 --> 25:00.670]  and certifying these things on this route,
[25:00.670 --> 25:02.670]  that's where we're moving to.
[25:02.670 --> 25:03.670]  So what's your opinion?
[25:03.670 --> 25:05.670]  Because clearly you must have a passion
[25:05.670 --> 25:07.670]  for having seeds in the plant
[25:07.670 --> 25:09.670]  and that variability.
[25:09.670 --> 25:11.670]  What's your opinion on that?
[25:11.670 --> 25:14.670]  And I'd love to hear from you too, Natasha, on this.
[25:14.670 --> 25:16.670]  Yeah, I'll let Natasha go first.
[25:16.670 --> 25:17.670]  Go for it.
[25:17.870 --> 25:19.870]  I was going to say.
[25:20.870 --> 25:21.870]  It's a tough one.
[25:24.870 --> 25:26.870]  Yeah, I can jump in here.
[25:26.870 --> 25:27.870]  You go first.
[25:27.870 --> 25:31.870]  Okay, so we have 49,000 seeds downstairs.
[25:32.870 --> 25:34.870]  So there's enough variability
[25:34.870 --> 25:36.870]  in our vault downstairs
[25:36.870 --> 25:37.870]  to be at this for so long
[25:37.870 --> 25:39.870]  and be dead by the time they're done.
[25:39.870 --> 25:42.870]  So, well, we hopefully have them long enough,
[25:42.870 --> 25:43.870]  but we'll see.
[25:43.870 --> 25:44.870]  But anyways,
[25:45.070 --> 25:47.070]  what's been really interesting for us
[25:47.070 --> 25:49.070]  is we've seen, you know,
[25:49.070 --> 25:50.070]  because of course,
[25:50.070 --> 25:52.070]  before we made our declaration,
[25:52.070 --> 25:54.070]  you have to get everything in house
[25:54.070 --> 25:56.070]  and get all that kind of stuff done.
[25:56.070 --> 25:57.070]  Since we made our declaration,
[25:57.070 --> 25:58.070]  got our license
[25:58.070 --> 26:00.070]  and started doing some hunting,
[26:00.070 --> 26:04.070]  we've seen like some super unique things
[26:04.070 --> 26:06.070]  go on through seed packs.
[26:06.070 --> 26:09.070]  But we've also seen seed packs with disease in them.
[26:09.070 --> 26:10.070]  Right?
[26:10.070 --> 26:12.070]  Like that's been the other thing.
[26:12.070 --> 26:14.070]  Like we just did a phenyl hunt
[26:14.270 --> 26:16.270]  and killed an entire run
[26:16.270 --> 26:20.270]  because the seeds had hops.
[26:21.270 --> 26:23.270]  Holy, yeah.
[26:23.270 --> 26:24.270]  Right?
[26:24.270 --> 26:26.270]  And hops is in way more stuff
[26:26.270 --> 26:27.270]  than people think it is.
[26:27.270 --> 26:28.270]  I can tell you that.
[26:28.270 --> 26:30.270]  We literally had planted,
[26:30.270 --> 26:32.270]  tested, cleaned three times
[26:32.270 --> 26:35.270]  from a third-party accredited laboratory
[26:35.270 --> 26:37.270]  because we test everything
[26:37.270 --> 26:38.270]  over and over and over again.
[26:38.270 --> 26:39.270]  And then all of a sudden
[26:39.270 --> 26:41.270]  the slightest bit of hops comes in for us.
[26:42.270 --> 26:43.270]  Got to destroy the whole line.
[26:43.470 --> 26:44.470]  Got to destroy everything in the room
[26:44.470 --> 26:45.470]  and you got to start over.
[26:45.470 --> 26:47.470]  So it's great and it's fun
[26:47.470 --> 26:48.470]  to come from these seeds.
[26:48.470 --> 26:50.470]  But I would urge every single person
[26:50.470 --> 26:53.470]  that's messing with their seed vaults right now.
[26:54.470 --> 26:55.470]  As soon as you pop these things
[26:55.470 --> 26:56.470]  and they're big enough,
[26:56.470 --> 26:57.470]  get them off to a laboratory
[26:57.470 --> 26:58.470]  and have them tested
[26:58.470 --> 26:59.470]  because you could be contaminating
[26:59.470 --> 27:01.470]  your entire site and not know.
[27:04.470 --> 27:05.470]  Sorry.
[27:05.470 --> 27:07.470]  I just learned that seeds can have viruses too.
[27:07.470 --> 27:08.470]  From my growers,
[27:08.470 --> 27:10.470]  we were talking about seeds
[27:10.470 --> 27:11.470]  and all that stuff
[27:11.470 --> 27:12.470]  because I kind of got excited about it.
[27:12.670 --> 27:13.670]  And yeah,
[27:13.670 --> 27:14.670]  I just realized
[27:14.670 --> 27:15.670]  that they can have viruses.
[27:16.670 --> 27:18.670]  You can have non-feminized seeds
[27:18.670 --> 27:19.670]  in your packs.
[27:19.670 --> 27:21.670]  That'll screw with your crops.
[27:22.670 --> 27:23.670]  It's kind of scary.
[27:23.670 --> 27:25.670]  That's why I like working with Clinetics.
[27:25.670 --> 27:26.670]  You get consistency.
[27:26.670 --> 27:27.670]  That's my biggest thing,
[27:27.670 --> 27:30.670]  at least as a commercial kind of grow.
[27:30.670 --> 27:31.670]  I like the consistency.
[27:31.670 --> 27:33.670]  I like that I know what I'm getting
[27:33.670 --> 27:34.670]  and that they're clean.
[27:38.670 --> 27:39.670]  Yeah.
[27:39.670 --> 27:41.670]  And having that selectability
[27:41.870 --> 27:42.870]  and having something
[27:42.870 --> 27:43.870]  that's proven embedded
[27:43.870 --> 27:45.870]  is the challenge, right?
[27:45.870 --> 27:46.870]  Because it's a headache
[27:46.870 --> 27:47.870]  especially if you're growing
[27:47.870 --> 27:48.870]  on a medicinal level,
[27:48.870 --> 27:50.870]  on a home hobby level.
[27:50.870 --> 27:51.870]  It's a challenge.
[27:51.870 --> 27:52.870]  You miss one run.
[27:52.870 --> 27:55.870]  I did a seed run of 2,000 seeds
[27:55.870 --> 27:58.870]  and I hit four small plants with them
[27:58.870 --> 27:59.870]  so I didn't do a small bit.
[27:59.870 --> 28:02.870]  But now I don't have as much medicine
[28:02.870 --> 28:03.870]  as I usually have
[28:03.870 --> 28:05.870]  in the periods of time.
[28:05.870 --> 28:07.870]  It's got its own value to it
[28:07.870 --> 28:08.870]  but it's interesting
[28:08.870 --> 28:09.870]  because especially when you're looking
[28:09.870 --> 28:10.870]  at home,
[28:11.070 --> 28:12.070]  especially when you're looking
[28:12.070 --> 28:13.070]  at home growers
[28:13.070 --> 28:14.070]  that are just growing
[28:14.070 --> 28:15.070]  medicine for themselves,
[28:15.070 --> 28:16.070]  they open that pack of seed
[28:16.070 --> 28:17.070]  and they get a hermaphrodite in there.
[28:17.070 --> 28:18.070]  They get something
[28:18.070 --> 28:19.070]  with some lack of stability
[28:19.070 --> 28:23.070]  and it's their sanity for a month.
[28:23.070 --> 28:25.070]  They're scrounging through roaches.
[28:25.070 --> 28:26.070]  They're trying to dig through.
[28:26.070 --> 28:28.070]  Nobody saves the roach
[28:28.070 --> 28:29.070]  until they're down
[28:29.070 --> 28:30.070]  to their last eight.
[28:30.070 --> 28:31.070]  You know what I mean?
[28:31.070 --> 28:33.070]  Nobody's ever done that.
[28:33.070 --> 28:34.070]  I got a pound of weed.
[28:34.070 --> 28:36.070]  I'm going to save all my roaches.
[28:36.070 --> 28:37.070]  No one does that
[28:37.070 --> 28:38.070]  and at least I don't.
[28:38.070 --> 28:39.070]  I wait until I'm down
[28:39.070 --> 28:40.070]  to my last eight
[28:40.270 --> 28:41.270]  before I do that.
[28:41.270 --> 28:42.270]  Maybe it's bad foresight.
[28:42.270 --> 28:43.270]  Maybe I'm just not an intelligent
[28:43.270 --> 28:44.270]  enough person to do that
[28:44.270 --> 28:47.270]  but it's an interesting idea
[28:47.270 --> 28:49.270]  so I think it's something important
[28:49.270 --> 28:50.270]  to touch on
[28:50.270 --> 28:51.270]  the ability to get there
[28:51.270 --> 28:52.270]  and are you able
[28:52.270 --> 28:54.270]  as an ACMPR licensed
[28:54.270 --> 28:57.270]  to get genetics from you all?
[28:57.270 --> 28:59.270]  Purchase them at this point in time?
[28:59.270 --> 29:00.270]  Yes, so we're going to make
[29:00.270 --> 29:01.270]  an amendment to our license
[29:01.270 --> 29:03.270]  to be able to do that.
[29:03.270 --> 29:04.270]  Right now we deal with a group
[29:04.270 --> 29:05.270]  who...
[29:05.270 --> 29:07.270]  So this is another thing too
[29:07.270 --> 29:08.270]  that's unique about Clonetics
[29:08.270 --> 29:09.270]  is we deal with other nurseries.
[29:09.470 --> 29:10.470]  So we're not out there
[29:10.470 --> 29:12.470]  trying to eat everybody's lunch
[29:12.470 --> 29:13.470]  and take over the world
[29:13.470 --> 29:14.470]  and do that kind of stuff.
[29:14.470 --> 29:15.470]  We're actually collaborating
[29:15.470 --> 29:17.470]  with other nurseries,
[29:17.470 --> 29:18.470]  smaller guys,
[29:18.470 --> 29:19.470]  nurseries that came out
[29:19.470 --> 29:20.470]  of the Legacy Market,
[29:20.470 --> 29:22.470]  different things like that.
[29:22.470 --> 29:23.470]  They've got some great cuts
[29:23.470 --> 29:24.470]  they want to share with us
[29:24.470 --> 29:26.470]  which obviously works for us
[29:26.470 --> 29:29.470]  and helps our libraries as well.
[29:29.470 --> 29:31.470]  Right now,
[29:31.470 --> 29:32.470]  so we would sell to...
[29:32.470 --> 29:33.470]  We have a nursery
[29:33.470 --> 29:34.470]  that has some stuff
[29:34.470 --> 29:35.470]  that has a medical sales license
[29:35.470 --> 29:37.470]  that can sell you.
[29:37.670 --> 29:38.670]  Big thing for us
[29:38.670 --> 29:39.670]  is we are going to change
[29:39.670 --> 29:40.670]  that license.
[29:40.670 --> 29:41.670]  I can't tell you...
[29:41.670 --> 29:42.670]  Thank God our front door
[29:42.670 --> 29:43.670]  is locked.
[29:43.670 --> 29:44.670]  People are at our front door
[29:44.670 --> 29:45.670]  three, four times a day
[29:45.670 --> 29:46.670]  right now.
[29:46.670 --> 29:47.670]  I hear you guys sell clones
[29:47.670 --> 29:48.670]  and I'm like,
[29:48.670 --> 29:49.670]  yeah, well if you've got
[29:49.670 --> 29:50.670]  a 53-foot trailer
[29:50.670 --> 29:51.670]  come get some.
[29:51.670 --> 29:54.670]  Because legally we can't
[29:54.670 --> 29:57.670]  sell them to the ACMPR growers.
[29:57.670 --> 29:58.670]  But you can get
[29:58.670 --> 29:59.670]  a medical sales license
[29:59.670 --> 30:01.670]  and we are looking into
[30:01.670 --> 30:02.670]  doing that because we are
[30:02.670 --> 30:04.670]  getting so much demand.
[30:04.670 --> 30:05.670]  And then I think
[30:05.670 --> 30:06.670]  on the flip side for me,
[30:06.870 --> 30:08.870]  I'm from a military family.
[30:08.870 --> 30:10.870]  My dad was an ex-Canadian
[30:10.870 --> 30:11.870]  forces sniper.
[30:11.870 --> 30:12.870]  He was stationed
[30:12.870 --> 30:13.870]  all over the world.
[30:13.870 --> 30:14.870]  Unfortunately,
[30:14.870 --> 30:15.870]  he's passed from cancer now.
[30:15.870 --> 30:18.870]  There's a lot of military guys
[30:18.870 --> 30:19.870]  out there and women
[30:19.870 --> 30:21.870]  out there who are suffering.
[30:21.870 --> 30:25.870]  And we have this fallacy
[30:25.870 --> 30:26.870]  here in Canada
[30:26.870 --> 30:27.870]  that well,
[30:27.870 --> 30:28.870]  they didn't go to war
[30:28.870 --> 30:30.870]  they just went to peacekeeping.
[30:30.870 --> 30:31.870]  Peacekeeping can be
[30:31.870 --> 30:32.870]  some of the worst
[30:32.870 --> 30:33.870]  environments on the planet
[30:33.870 --> 30:35.870]  you will ever put a human being.
[30:36.070 --> 30:37.070]  The stuff that these
[30:37.070 --> 30:38.070]  poor people have seen
[30:38.070 --> 30:39.070]  and had to work through
[30:39.070 --> 30:40.070]  and do.
[30:40.070 --> 30:41.070]  And then don't forget
[30:41.070 --> 30:42.070]  we all think back
[30:42.070 --> 30:43.070]  to World War II,
[30:43.070 --> 30:44.070]  World War I.
[30:44.070 --> 30:45.070]  We have many,
[30:45.070 --> 30:46.070]  many, many, many
[30:46.070 --> 30:47.070]  combat veterans
[30:47.070 --> 30:48.070]  in Canada right now
[30:48.070 --> 30:49.070]  who served in Afghanistan.
[30:49.070 --> 30:50.070]  Our special forces
[30:50.070 --> 30:52.070]  serve all over the world
[30:52.070 --> 30:53.070]  and are sitting on
[30:53.070 --> 30:54.070]  different borders.
[30:54.070 --> 30:55.070]  As we speak right now
[30:55.070 --> 30:56.070]  in Europe,
[30:56.070 --> 30:57.070]  given the tensions
[30:57.070 --> 30:58.070]  in Europe right now,
[30:58.070 --> 30:59.070]  our JTF soldiers
[30:59.070 --> 31:00.070]  are everywhere.
[31:00.070 --> 31:01.070]  So everybody
[31:01.070 --> 31:02.070]  probably can go back
[31:02.070 --> 31:03.070]  on our LinkedIn
[31:03.070 --> 31:04.070]  and look and you
[31:04.070 --> 31:05.070]  will see armed
[31:05.270 --> 31:06.270]  guards pulling our
[31:06.270 --> 31:07.270]  first batch of clones
[31:07.270 --> 31:08.270]  out of this building.
[31:08.270 --> 31:09.270]  Now,
[31:09.270 --> 31:10.270]  do I think our stuff
[31:10.270 --> 31:11.270]  is so valuable
[31:11.270 --> 31:12.270]  I need armed guards?
[31:12.270 --> 31:13.270]  No.
[31:13.270 --> 31:14.270]  But we're dealing
[31:14.270 --> 31:15.270]  with a phenomenal
[31:15.270 --> 31:16.270]  group led by
[31:16.270 --> 31:17.270]  Cole Fourliard
[31:17.270 --> 31:18.270]  who are all
[31:18.270 --> 31:19.270]  ex-veterans
[31:19.270 --> 31:20.270]  and the way
[31:20.270 --> 31:21.270]  that they haul
[31:21.270 --> 31:22.270]  their stuff
[31:22.270 --> 31:23.270]  it doesn't matter
[31:23.270 --> 31:24.270]  what they're hauling
[31:24.270 --> 31:25.270]  they're always armed.
[31:25.270 --> 31:26.270]  So we have the
[31:26.270 --> 31:27.270]  privilege of our
[31:27.270 --> 31:28.270]  first set of
[31:28.270 --> 31:29.270]  ready to flower
[31:29.270 --> 31:30.270]  plants coming out
[31:30.270 --> 31:31.270]  the door by armed
[31:31.270 --> 31:32.270]  guards.
[31:32.270 --> 31:33.270]  That's kind of cool.
[31:33.270 --> 31:34.270]  Yeah.
[31:34.470 --> 31:35.470]  But the consistency
[31:35.470 --> 31:36.470]  in the strains
[31:36.470 --> 31:37.470]  is why I think
[31:37.470 --> 31:38.470]  for PTSD
[31:38.470 --> 31:39.470]  and different issues
[31:39.470 --> 31:40.470]  and that kind of stuff
[31:40.470 --> 31:41.470]  that people are
[31:41.470 --> 31:42.470]  experiencing,
[31:42.470 --> 31:43.470]  it's critical to
[31:43.470 --> 31:44.470]  medical patients.
[31:44.470 --> 31:45.470]  So people who are
[31:45.470 --> 31:46.470]  trying to treat
[31:46.470 --> 31:48.470]  certain ailments
[31:48.470 --> 31:49.470]  and different things
[31:49.470 --> 31:50.470]  from PTSD,
[31:50.470 --> 31:51.470]  they need consistency
[31:51.470 --> 31:52.470]  in what they're smoking
[31:52.470 --> 31:53.470]  or what they're ingesting
[31:53.470 --> 31:54.470]  or what oils
[31:54.470 --> 31:55.470]  they're taking.
[31:55.470 --> 31:56.470]  It's important
[31:56.470 --> 31:57.470]  for them
[31:57.470 --> 31:58.470]  because it is
[31:58.470 --> 31:59.470]  a real medication
[31:59.470 --> 32:00.470]  for them.
[32:00.470 --> 32:01.470]  It's not a Saturday
[32:01.470 --> 32:02.470]  night,
[32:02.470 --> 32:03.470]  let's go out
[32:03.670 --> 32:04.670]  and do something
[32:04.670 --> 32:05.670]  that gets them
[32:05.670 --> 32:06.670]  through the day.
[32:06.670 --> 32:07.670]  And I know Natasha
[32:07.670 --> 32:08.670]  and her group
[32:08.670 --> 32:09.670]  huge supporters
[32:09.670 --> 32:10.670]  of the military
[32:10.670 --> 32:11.670]  and stuff.
[32:11.670 --> 32:12.670]  I saw a video
[32:12.670 --> 32:13.670]  the other day.
[32:13.670 --> 32:14.670]  Apple Medics,
[32:14.670 --> 32:15.670]  yeah.
[32:15.670 --> 32:16.670]  We grow
[32:16.670 --> 32:17.670]  Veterans Cush
[32:17.670 --> 32:18.670]  for our vets
[32:18.670 --> 32:19.670]  through Apple Medics'
[32:19.670 --> 32:20.670]  medical platform.
[32:20.670 --> 32:21.670]  Yeah.
[32:21.670 --> 32:22.670]  So it's nice
[32:22.670 --> 32:23.670]  that you
[32:23.670 --> 32:24.670]  had time to talk
[32:24.670 --> 32:25.670]  to us.
[32:25.670 --> 32:26.670]  Do you want to
[32:26.670 --> 32:27.670]  dig into that
[32:27.670 --> 32:28.670]  a little bit
[32:28.670 --> 32:29.670]  and tell us
[32:29.670 --> 32:30.670]  a little bit
[32:30.670 --> 32:31.670]  more about that
[32:31.670 --> 32:32.670]  program?
[32:32.870 --> 32:33.870]  So,
[32:33.870 --> 32:34.870]  it's for the
[32:34.870 --> 32:35.870]  Veterans Cush
[32:35.870 --> 32:36.870]  by Apple Medics
[32:36.870 --> 32:37.870]  and so
[32:37.870 --> 32:38.870]  it's strictly
[32:38.870 --> 32:39.870]  on their
[32:39.870 --> 32:40.870]  medical platform.
[32:40.870 --> 32:41.870]  It's for vets
[32:41.870 --> 32:42.870]  for their PTSD
[32:42.870 --> 32:43.870]  for pain.
[32:43.870 --> 32:44.870]  It's a great
[32:44.870 --> 32:45.870]  strain.
[32:45.870 --> 32:46.870]  They loved
[32:46.870 --> 32:47.870]  it so much.
[32:47.870 --> 32:48.870]  It's a very
[32:48.870 --> 32:49.870]  purple,
[32:49.870 --> 32:50.870]  beautiful bud.
[32:50.870 --> 32:51.870]  But yeah,
[32:51.870 --> 32:52.870]  it was
[32:52.870 --> 32:53.870]  tailored
[32:53.870 --> 32:54.870]  toward our
[32:54.870 --> 32:55.870]  military or veterans
[32:55.870 --> 32:56.870]  so to be
[32:56.870 --> 32:57.870]  dealing with
[32:57.870 --> 32:58.870]  stuff that
[32:58.870 --> 32:59.870]  they had been
[32:59.870 --> 33:00.870]  dealing with.
[33:00.870 --> 33:01.870]  So yeah,
[33:02.070 --> 33:03.070]  it was really
[33:03.070 --> 33:04.070]  cool to be
[33:04.070 --> 33:05.070]  able to have
[33:05.070 --> 33:06.070]  that kind of
[33:06.070 --> 33:07.070]  purpose to
[33:07.070 --> 33:08.070]  grow for
[33:08.070 --> 33:09.070]  them and
[33:09.070 --> 33:10.070]  to help people.
[33:10.070 --> 33:11.070]  And wasn't
[33:11.070 --> 33:12.070]  the,
[33:12.070 --> 33:13.070]  if I'm correct,
[33:13.070 --> 33:14.070]  if my memory
[33:14.070 --> 33:15.070]  serves me right,
[33:15.070 --> 33:16.070]  that was
[33:16.070 --> 33:17.070]  government-paid
[33:17.070 --> 33:18.070]  cannabis,
[33:18.070 --> 33:19.070]  right?
[33:19.070 --> 33:20.070]  Like the
[33:20.070 --> 33:21.070]  government paid
[33:21.070 --> 33:22.070]  for that
[33:22.070 --> 33:23.070]  cannabis for
[33:23.070 --> 33:24.070]  the veterans
[33:24.070 --> 33:25.070]  or did they
[33:25.070 --> 33:26.070]  get through
[33:26.070 --> 33:27.070]  a medical
[33:27.070 --> 33:28.070]  insurance?
[33:28.070 --> 33:29.070]  Yeah,
[33:29.070 --> 33:30.070]  they had
[33:30.070 --> 33:31.070]  a veteran,
[33:31.270 --> 33:32.270]  which is
[33:32.270 --> 33:33.270]  pretty cool.
[33:33.270 --> 33:34.270]  That's an
[33:34.270 --> 33:35.270]  amazing program.
[33:35.270 --> 33:36.270]  I think one of
[33:36.270 --> 33:37.270]  the first of
[33:37.270 --> 33:38.270]  its kind
[33:38.270 --> 33:39.270]  in probably
[33:39.270 --> 33:40.270]  the world.
[33:40.270 --> 33:41.270]  I remember
[33:41.270 --> 33:42.270]  when Canada
[33:42.270 --> 33:43.270]  announced that
[33:43.270 --> 33:44.270]  they were
[33:44.270 --> 33:45.270]  going to do
[33:45.270 --> 33:46.270]  that and
[33:46.270 --> 33:47.270]  supply it.
[33:47.270 --> 33:48.270]  And I think
[33:48.270 --> 33:49.270]  they're also
[33:49.270 --> 33:50.270]  doing a program
[33:50.270 --> 33:51.270]  where they
[33:51.270 --> 33:52.270]  help with
[33:52.270 --> 33:53.270]  the ACMPR
[33:53.270 --> 33:54.270]  licensing in
[33:54.270 --> 33:55.270]  at least in
[33:55.270 --> 33:56.270]  Eastern Canada.
[33:56.270 --> 33:57.270]  It's what
[33:57.270 --> 33:58.270]  I've heard
[33:58.270 --> 33:59.270]  anyways,
[33:59.270 --> 34:00.270]  that they
[34:00.470 --> 34:01.470]  it's amazing.
[34:01.470 --> 34:02.470]  It's just
[34:02.470 --> 34:03.470]  amazing to
[34:03.470 --> 34:04.470]  also grow
[34:04.470 --> 34:05.470]  for a purpose.
[34:05.470 --> 34:06.470]  I love the
[34:06.470 --> 34:07.470]  rec market.
[34:07.470 --> 34:08.470]  Don't get me
[34:08.470 --> 34:09.470]  wrong.
[34:09.470 --> 34:10.470]  I think it's
[34:10.470 --> 34:11.470]  amazing.
[34:11.470 --> 34:12.470]  I absolutely
[34:12.470 --> 34:13.470]  love it,
[34:13.470 --> 34:14.470]  but it's
[34:14.470 --> 34:15.470]  nice to have
[34:15.470 --> 34:16.470]  that little
[34:16.470 --> 34:17.470]  piece to be
[34:17.470 --> 34:18.470]  able to say,
[34:18.470 --> 34:19.470]  you know what
[34:19.470 --> 34:20.470]  someone's smoking
[34:20.470 --> 34:21.470]  my cannabis
[34:21.470 --> 34:22.470]  or ingesting
[34:22.470 --> 34:23.470]  or however
[34:23.470 --> 34:24.470]  because it
[34:24.470 --> 34:25.470]  helps them.
[34:25.470 --> 34:26.470]  I've spoken
[34:26.470 --> 34:27.470]  to vets.
[34:27.470 --> 34:28.470]  We had Glenn
[34:28.470 --> 34:29.470]  from Aba
[34:29.670 --> 34:30.670]  who was
[34:30.670 --> 34:31.670]  doing a
[34:31.670 --> 34:32.270]  different
[34:32.270 --> 34:33.270]  area and
[34:33.270 --> 34:34.170]  he had
[34:34.170 --> 34:35.170]  a idea
[34:35.170 --> 34:36.170]  for a
[34:36.170 --> 34:36.670]  commercial
[34:36.670 --> 34:37.670]  cannabis
[34:37.670 --> 34:38.670]  L.A.
[34:38.670 --> 34:39.630]  consultancy
[34:39.630 --> 34:40.670]  and I
[34:40.670 --> 34:41.670]  thought
[34:41.670 --> 34:42.670]  that was
[34:42.670 --> 34:43.670]  amazing.
[34:43.670 --> 34:44.670]  Because
[34:44.670 --> 34:45.670]  they had
[34:45.670 --> 34:46.670]  their first
[34:46.670 --> 34:47.670]  client
[34:47.670 --> 34:48.670]  a year
[34:48.670 --> 34:49.670]  ago
[34:49.670 --> 34:50.670]  and
[34:50.670 --> 34:51.670]  they
[34:51.670 --> 34:52.670]  government
[34:52.670 --> 34:53.670]  said
[34:53.670 --> 34:54.670]  we
[34:54.670 --> 34:55.670]  signed
[34:55.670 --> 34:56.670]  a letter
[34:56.670 --> 34:57.670]  to sponsor
[34:57.670 --> 34:58.670]  cloning
[34:58.670 --> 35:01.550]  to sponsor a program through the University of Saskatchewan,
[35:01.550 --> 35:04.710]  University of Regina, to supply germplasm
[35:04.710 --> 35:07.710]  for traumatic brain injury and concussion research
[35:07.710 --> 35:09.830]  for the National Heart Association.
[35:09.830 --> 35:13.910]  So when you see major organizations like the NFL
[35:13.910 --> 35:15.950]  and different things like that,
[35:15.950 --> 35:19.350]  you know if this gains any ground for the NFL,
[35:19.350 --> 35:24.190]  the CFL, the NHL, all these major concussion type sports
[35:24.190 --> 35:28.230]  will actually have something to help their people.
[35:28.230 --> 35:31.310]  And it's like we're doing some incredible things
[35:31.310 --> 35:33.230]  as an industry, not as clonetics,
[35:33.230 --> 35:35.670]  as an industry that's really gonna help people.
[35:35.670 --> 35:40.430]  When you look at a friend of mine, his son has epilepsy.
[35:40.430 --> 35:42.190]  He's been on 50 different drugs.
[35:42.190 --> 35:44.710]  And I'm like, have you looked at CBD?
[35:44.710 --> 35:46.870]  Have you looked at the different cannabis oils
[35:46.870 --> 35:48.390]  that are out there?
[35:48.390 --> 35:50.390]  He went from being one of those guys who's like,
[35:50.390 --> 35:52.710]  nah, you know, I'm not really into cannabis,
[35:52.710 --> 35:55.590]  to he must've forgot that I'd said it to him.
[35:55.590 --> 35:57.070]  He sent me this link the other day and said,
[35:57.070 --> 35:58.070]  you gotta check this out,
[35:58.070 --> 35:59.950]  like what this can do for epilepsy.
[35:59.950 --> 36:02.350]  And I'm like, yeah, I'll give you a few people
[36:02.350 --> 36:04.030]  to check that out, but it doesn't matter.
[36:04.030 --> 36:07.270]  Now he's a believer and he's actively looking
[36:07.270 --> 36:09.270]  for alternatives for his son's epilepsy.
[36:09.270 --> 36:10.870]  So it's awesome.
[36:10.870 --> 36:13.550]  It's so nice to turn people from pills
[36:13.550 --> 36:18.550]  and those kinds of things to cannabis, CBD, oils, edibles.
[36:18.750 --> 36:19.710]  You don't have to smoke it.
[36:19.710 --> 36:23.470]  It's very, it's healthier to ingest or whatever the case is.
[36:23.470 --> 36:26.750]  It's just, it's so rewarding.
[36:27.710 --> 36:29.630]  I mean, it's really, it's like, you know,
[36:29.630 --> 36:31.630]  there's a reason why they call it a plant from the gods.
[36:31.630 --> 36:32.470]  Right?
[36:32.470 --> 36:35.870]  It really is something truly unique that can affect people
[36:35.870 --> 36:37.350]  in all kinds of different ways.
[36:37.350 --> 36:39.470]  Everything from rolling on the floor,
[36:39.470 --> 36:42.550]  laughing on a Saturday night to it getting you
[36:42.550 --> 36:44.310]  through the day so you can survive.
[36:44.310 --> 36:45.870]  So it's pretty amazing.
[36:45.870 --> 36:46.790]  Yeah.
[36:46.790 --> 36:48.150]  I'm very excited.
[36:48.150 --> 36:51.550]  So I was a chef in a previous life, I'd like to say.
[36:51.550 --> 36:53.550]  I was the executive chef of a fairly large,
[36:53.550 --> 36:55.230]  well-known restaurant in downtown Vancouver
[36:55.230 --> 36:56.790]  called Black and Blue for about five years.
[36:56.790 --> 36:58.150]  I ran it.
[36:58.150 --> 36:59.950]  Big steakhouse, big, huge one.
[36:59.950 --> 37:00.910]  It's a lot of fun.
[37:00.910 --> 37:04.070]  But anyways, one of the biggest things that really,
[37:04.070 --> 37:05.910]  it got me excited about cannabis
[37:05.910 --> 37:07.230]  is the culinary applications
[37:07.230 --> 37:09.310]  because of the diversity of flavor profiles
[37:09.310 --> 37:11.950]  that come out in cannabis as a herb.
[37:11.950 --> 37:12.790]  Holy shit.
[37:12.790 --> 37:14.830]  There's so many awesome things and potentials there
[37:14.830 --> 37:16.590]  that'll be coming up.
[37:16.590 --> 37:18.630]  But I think we should maybe start getting
[37:18.630 --> 37:19.990]  to check out some plants.
[37:19.990 --> 37:21.150]  Is it about that time?
[37:21.150 --> 37:22.950]  What do you all think?
[37:22.950 --> 37:23.790]  Yeah, absolutely.
[37:23.950 --> 37:24.830]  I'm gonna go downstairs.
[37:24.830 --> 37:26.990]  I'm gonna get off, go downstairs, get gowned up
[37:26.990 --> 37:29.750]  and then come back on.
[37:29.750 --> 37:32.230]  Is there anything else we wanted to cover?
[37:32.230 --> 37:33.830]  I mean, we touched on the podcast.
[37:33.830 --> 37:36.190]  So make sure people go check that out when it drops
[37:36.190 --> 37:38.150]  and we'll put that in the link,
[37:38.150 --> 37:40.910]  in the description as a link when it's available
[37:40.910 --> 37:43.790]  because it's not available till like July or something.
[37:43.790 --> 37:45.430]  But we'll make sure to put that in the description
[37:45.430 --> 37:47.190]  of the show for those people that watch this
[37:47.190 --> 37:48.030]  at that point in time
[37:48.030 --> 37:50.630]  because we get a lot of late watchers as well.
[37:50.630 --> 37:51.710]  But why don't you go and do that?
[37:51.710 --> 37:53.950]  And Natasha and I will get comfortable
[37:53.950 --> 37:57.070]  and get chatting about what's going on in her garden.
[37:57.070 --> 37:57.910]  Sounds awesome.
[37:57.910 --> 37:58.910]  Thanks very much guys.
[38:00.230 --> 38:01.070]  Thank you, David.
[38:01.070 --> 38:02.470]  We'll see you shortly.
[38:02.470 --> 38:03.910]  Alrighty.
[38:03.910 --> 38:05.390]  Oh my God, I'm so excited to show you guys.
[38:05.390 --> 38:06.750]  Okay, so we'll start.
[38:06.750 --> 38:11.030]  Like I said, I have baby, toddler, teen, adult.
[38:11.030 --> 38:13.470]  So we'll start from the little babies.
[38:13.470 --> 38:16.590]  These, I'm gonna just turn this over like that.
[38:16.590 --> 38:19.710]  And let me just turn my camera around.
[38:19.710 --> 38:21.550]  That's an interesting statement, D-Wrek.
[38:22.390 --> 38:23.230]  I'm just reading the comments here.
[38:23.230 --> 38:24.230]  And he said, London,
[38:24.230 --> 38:27.470]  will cannabis pistols become the new saffron?
[38:27.470 --> 38:31.270]  And you know what, D-Wrek, it's possible.
[38:31.270 --> 38:34.590]  Not impossible because if you look at what it is,
[38:34.590 --> 38:36.830]  that's what saffron is, pistols.
[38:36.830 --> 38:39.750]  So you could breed something with a strong flavor of pistil.
[38:39.750 --> 38:40.910]  It's totally possible.
[38:42.350 --> 38:43.390]  Amazing.
[38:43.390 --> 38:45.470]  Cool, so we're in the clone room now.
[38:45.470 --> 38:47.030]  We are in the clone room.
[38:47.030 --> 38:48.990]  This is our clone rack.
[38:48.990 --> 38:50.830]  And I'll just lift some of these guys.
[38:51.110 --> 38:54.230]  So these guys were taken yesterday.
[38:54.230 --> 38:56.190]  So they're super baby.
[38:56.190 --> 38:57.030]  Sorry, guys.
[38:58.270 --> 39:00.590]  All right, so here we go.
[39:01.430 --> 39:02.270]  Oh, look how pretty they are.
[39:02.270 --> 39:04.470]  Oh, wow, those are super happy.
[39:04.470 --> 39:05.830]  Super, super happy.
[39:05.830 --> 39:09.870]  So, I mean, you usually get your clones from Clunetics,
[39:09.870 --> 39:13.590]  or do you get a mother parent and then move those over?
[39:13.590 --> 39:15.670]  Or is this just some other stuff that you're working on?
[39:15.670 --> 39:17.110]  Because it sounds like you're doing more
[39:17.110 --> 39:19.070]  than just one little thing at your facility.
[39:19.110 --> 39:20.870]  It sounds like you're doing a lot of cool stuff.
[39:20.870 --> 39:23.630]  So what we're doing right now with Clunetics
[39:23.630 --> 39:28.630]  is we have, we grew, so we've been getting clones from them
[39:28.630 --> 39:30.750]  and they've been shipping us clones.
[39:30.750 --> 39:32.550]  And so then we started kind of,
[39:32.550 --> 39:33.510]  I don't know what it's called,
[39:33.510 --> 39:35.350]  but I'm gonna say a mother program
[39:35.350 --> 39:38.990]  where we grew out mothers.
[39:38.990 --> 39:42.670]  And now we take our own cuttings from our mom plants.
[39:42.670 --> 39:45.030]  So these are our first from our mom plants
[39:45.030 --> 39:48.150]  because they're just now big enough.
[39:49.110 --> 39:51.510]  And these are just so pretty.
[39:51.510 --> 39:52.350]  Yes. And healthy.
[39:52.350 --> 39:53.910]  Very nice and nicely well cut.
[39:53.910 --> 39:58.430]  You put a ton of plants in that little dome there.
[39:58.430 --> 40:00.990]  You definitely pack it full.
[40:00.990 --> 40:03.750]  You wanna talk a little bit about your process?
[40:03.750 --> 40:05.790]  Do you wanna talk a little bit about that process there?
[40:05.790 --> 40:07.230]  It looks like you're making sure
[40:07.230 --> 40:09.790]  that you have a certain size of clone cut there
[40:09.790 --> 40:11.470]  or using gel. Right.
[40:11.470 --> 40:16.470]  So we, okay, so we take our clones from our moms.
[40:16.470 --> 40:20.230]  We take about 420 viable clones.
[40:20.230 --> 40:21.590]  We do, we take a little bit more,
[40:21.590 --> 40:24.310]  mostly just so that we can ensure
[40:24.310 --> 40:28.630]  that we have 422 fully transplant.
[40:28.630 --> 40:31.030]  Not all of them make it, of course.
[40:31.030 --> 40:32.670]  Yeah. All we do is very standard.
[40:32.670 --> 40:34.830]  You'll, we'll take a peek at the mother plants.
[40:34.830 --> 40:36.430]  They're in another room right now,
[40:36.430 --> 40:39.270]  but we just take off the mom plants.
[40:39.270 --> 40:41.750]  We use just rooting hormone
[40:41.750 --> 40:44.590]  and stick it into these little rock hole cubes.
[40:44.590 --> 40:45.410]  And away we go.
[40:45.410 --> 40:46.450]  We'll keep them in the domes
[40:46.450 --> 40:49.970]  for about seven to 10 days, depending.
[40:49.970 --> 40:50.810]  And like I said,
[40:50.810 --> 40:53.010]  this is our first time cutting our clones ourselves.
[40:53.010 --> 40:56.370]  So we gotta just kind of make sure,
[40:56.370 --> 40:58.130]  you know, you gotta judge the plant.
[40:58.130 --> 41:01.210]  I can't kind of say days and times
[41:01.210 --> 41:02.810]  of when we're gonna do stuff exactly.
[41:02.810 --> 41:04.290]  For us, it's do farms.
[41:04.290 --> 41:05.970]  The plants tell us what to do.
[41:05.970 --> 41:07.570]  We don't tell them what to do.
[41:07.570 --> 41:10.090]  So we kind of look at them, look at their health,
[41:10.090 --> 41:11.770]  see if they can make it.
[41:11.770 --> 41:14.450]  And then, and then we act accordingly.
[41:15.770 --> 41:19.290]  That poor one on the right there got trapped in this thing.
[41:19.290 --> 41:20.410]  This little poor guy.
[41:20.410 --> 41:21.730]  And it's still alive.
[41:21.730 --> 41:23.610]  Yeah, this is what happens.
[41:23.610 --> 41:25.570]  See, your domes, when you put them on,
[41:25.570 --> 41:28.130]  you have to make sure you tuck all the plants upward.
[41:28.130 --> 41:29.610]  Cause as healthy as this guy is,
[41:29.610 --> 41:31.450]  he's used to being tucked a little bit downward,
[41:31.450 --> 41:32.690]  but we'll make sure he's okay.
[41:32.690 --> 41:34.210]  I do that all the fucking time.
[41:34.210 --> 41:35.050]  Right?
[41:35.050 --> 41:36.410]  Oh man.
[41:36.410 --> 41:38.250]  Like I crunch them every once in a while.
[41:38.250 --> 41:40.250]  And it's like, oh shit.
[41:40.250 --> 41:41.210]  Right, right, right.
[41:41.210 --> 41:42.450]  It's hard. It's hard.
[41:42.450 --> 41:45.330]  The domes, I mean, see, and here we go.
[41:46.130 --> 41:47.810]  What temperature do you like to run in there?
[41:47.810 --> 41:50.010]  And how much, what strength of lighting
[41:50.010 --> 41:51.730]  are you running as well?
[41:51.730 --> 41:54.170]  I think a lot of people put way too much lighting
[41:54.170 --> 41:56.850]  on their clones because it just makes too much,
[41:56.850 --> 41:58.490]  like it's not quite as necessary.
[41:58.490 --> 41:59.730]  So I love touching on those subjects
[41:59.730 --> 42:01.570]  when we get to places like this.
[42:01.570 --> 42:03.890]  Well, you know what the best part about clone domes is?
[42:03.890 --> 42:06.130]  You don't have to worry about humidity at all, obviously,
[42:06.130 --> 42:07.850]  because the clone, the dome keeps,
[42:07.850 --> 42:11.970]  I think it's like 99, 95, 95, 200% humidity in there.
[42:11.970 --> 42:13.410]  So that's great.
[42:13.410 --> 42:15.690]  We actually decided to kind of crack open
[42:15.690 --> 42:18.370]  the tops a little bit just to get them to breathe
[42:18.370 --> 42:22.770]  because we're noticing with this strain, it is a monster.
[42:22.770 --> 42:25.290]  Like it, usually you would have to keep it all closed
[42:25.290 --> 42:26.770]  during the first couple of days.
[42:26.770 --> 42:28.650]  These guys just want to breathe.
[42:28.650 --> 42:30.210]  They're really happy.
[42:30.210 --> 42:33.690]  So like I said, they're telling us what they need and want.
[42:33.690 --> 42:35.250]  And it looks like they just want to breathe a little
[42:35.250 --> 42:36.090]  on their own.
[42:36.090 --> 42:37.890]  So we opened the domes.
[42:37.890 --> 42:41.010]  Temperature, I think we're keeping it right now
[42:41.010 --> 42:42.770]  at maybe 25, 26.
[42:42.930 --> 42:45.250]  And we are using T5s.
[42:45.250 --> 42:48.210]  This clone rack is actually from our friends
[42:48.210 --> 42:52.450]  over at Growhouse, but just your standard T5.
[42:52.450 --> 42:55.970]  And we're only using one bar per three trays.
[42:55.970 --> 42:58.810]  So like you said, not too much light, exactly.
[42:58.810 --> 43:01.170]  Like usually there'd be two bars.
[43:01.170 --> 43:03.930]  We're just using the one just to baby them a bit.
[43:03.930 --> 43:04.770]  See how we do that.
[43:04.770 --> 43:06.210]  Yeah, I mean, people like,
[43:06.210 --> 43:08.410]  especially in the early stage of clone cutting,
[43:08.410 --> 43:10.770]  they blast them with way too much light.
[43:10.810 --> 43:12.890]  The thing is, is like you want root growth.
[43:12.890 --> 43:15.450]  You don't want necessarily as much,
[43:15.450 --> 43:17.890]  but like as much, what's it called?
[43:17.890 --> 43:19.570]  Shit, I'm totally blanking on it.
[43:19.570 --> 43:21.090]  You don't want as much,
[43:21.090 --> 43:24.170]  like the plant to convert energy into growth on the top.
[43:24.170 --> 43:25.850]  Right, and by having too much light,
[43:25.850 --> 43:27.570]  you'll eat all that energy
[43:27.570 --> 43:29.490]  when it's getting done from the bottom, right?
[43:29.490 --> 43:31.650]  Exactly, well, and I'm starting to learn
[43:31.650 --> 43:32.770]  from my growers as well,
[43:32.770 --> 43:36.210]  is that it's not the tops that matter in these stages.
[43:36.210 --> 43:37.170]  It's the root growth.
[43:37.170 --> 43:40.010]  It's the stuff you can't see that matters right now.
[43:40.010 --> 43:43.010]  The tops obviously need to look green and healthy,
[43:43.010 --> 43:45.930]  but that's not the part that's growing right now.
[43:45.930 --> 43:46.770]  You need to have-
[43:46.770 --> 43:47.610]  Thank you, Bobbie.
[43:47.610 --> 43:49.290]  Photosynthesis is the correct answer.
[43:49.290 --> 43:50.130]  Thank you. Photosynthesis.
[43:50.130 --> 43:52.570]  I appreciate that.
[43:54.010 --> 43:55.690]  Amazing, but yeah,
[43:55.690 --> 43:58.210]  we were toying with the idea of heat pads
[43:58.210 --> 43:59.930]  underneath our clone domes.
[44:01.130 --> 44:04.410]  Right now, we're not seeing that they need it,
[44:04.410 --> 44:06.850]  but my growers were saying that maybe we should think of it.
[44:06.890 --> 44:09.090]  It just scares me because, you know,
[44:09.090 --> 44:11.330]  the heat pads always just are kind of scary,
[44:11.330 --> 44:13.090]  but it's something that we're toying with.
[44:13.090 --> 44:15.730]  So something that we may or may not get in the future,
[44:15.730 --> 44:17.170]  but as far as we can see,
[44:17.170 --> 44:18.610]  these guys are happy and healthy.
[44:18.610 --> 44:20.410]  So I mean, yeah.
[44:21.610 --> 44:23.170]  Killer, killer, killer, killer.
[44:23.170 --> 44:24.650]  They love it in here.
[44:24.650 --> 44:26.290]  All righty, do I go in the other room?
[44:26.290 --> 44:27.130]  Let's do it.
[44:27.130 --> 44:29.170]  Let's move forward.
[44:29.170 --> 44:30.010]  Let's go.
[44:30.010 --> 44:32.530]  Clones, look, you guys do a really good consistency,
[44:32.530 --> 44:33.970]  and it's nice to see there.
[44:33.970 --> 44:35.810]  I love that you guys make your own holes
[44:35.890 --> 44:37.170]  for your walk-wall fruit cubes
[44:37.170 --> 44:38.290]  instead of using the standard hole.
[44:38.290 --> 44:39.130]  Oh, you noticed?
[44:39.130 --> 44:40.970]  Yes, well, you know why?
[44:40.970 --> 44:42.610]  And obviously you would know why,
[44:42.610 --> 44:44.610]  but those holes are a little big,
[44:44.610 --> 44:47.050]  so they flop around, they don't get that rude,
[44:47.050 --> 44:50.970]  versus if you poke your clone right next to the hole,
[44:50.970 --> 44:52.930]  it's a very tight seal.
[44:52.930 --> 44:54.290]  The plants like it better,
[44:55.250 --> 44:57.290]  and that's what my growers tell me.
[44:58.570 --> 45:02.450]  All right, so this is now my toddler room.
[45:07.170 --> 45:08.010]  Boom.
[45:09.130 --> 45:11.610]  All right, so these guys are,
[45:11.610 --> 45:12.730]  let me get my paper out
[45:12.730 --> 45:15.450]  just to make sure I have the right info.
[45:15.450 --> 45:19.010]  These guys are week zero,
[45:19.010 --> 45:20.770]  actually week zero of flower.
[45:20.770 --> 45:25.770]  So we just brought them in here from our veg state.
[45:28.530 --> 45:29.810]  Okay, cool, so they're vegged
[45:29.810 --> 45:32.490]  in those larger rock-wall cubes?
[45:32.490 --> 45:33.330]  So what we do-
[45:33.330 --> 45:36.610]  The six by, or is it six by six or eight by eight?
[45:37.450 --> 45:39.450]  These ones are four by fours,
[45:39.450 --> 45:41.370]  and then these slabs, I believe,
[45:41.370 --> 45:44.170]  are six by 12, it looks like.
[45:44.170 --> 45:45.010]  Okay, cool.
[45:45.010 --> 45:47.130]  But what we do is,
[45:47.130 --> 45:48.090]  oh, sorry, do you hear me?
[45:48.090 --> 45:49.730]  Do you wanna turn the fan off?
[45:49.730 --> 45:51.850]  You're sounding quite fine, actually.
[45:51.850 --> 45:53.210]  It's all good.
[45:53.210 --> 45:57.410]  Perfect, so what we do is when we bring them,
[45:57.410 --> 45:59.930]  so pretty much, so what you saw in the domes,
[45:59.930 --> 46:04.930]  we pop into our cubes in the veg state still,
[46:04.930 --> 46:07.330]  and we keep them in these cubes for a couple weeks.
[46:07.330 --> 46:10.050]  We bring them in our larger flower rooms,
[46:10.050 --> 46:11.890]  of which we have three,
[46:11.890 --> 46:15.010]  and what happens is we keep them still vegged here
[46:15.010 --> 46:17.770]  for probably about four or five days
[46:17.770 --> 46:22.290]  just to get them acclimatized to the room itself,
[46:22.290 --> 46:24.370]  because we notice if we flip them to flower a lot,
[46:24.370 --> 46:26.210]  it just, there's a lot of transplant shock,
[46:26.210 --> 46:28.850]  and they don't seem to like it as much.
[46:28.850 --> 46:29.690]  So we just get them used to the room.
[46:29.690 --> 46:31.290]  Yeah, you gotta give that a relaxed time,
[46:31.290 --> 46:32.810]  you know, like you don't wanna flip them
[46:32.810 --> 46:33.650]  right off the bat.
[46:33.650 --> 46:34.770]  You won't have that growth.
[46:35.610 --> 46:36.450]  Exactly, exactly.
[46:36.450 --> 46:38.210]  You wanna always keep these guys happy.
[46:38.210 --> 46:40.690]  Again, a little stress is always great,
[46:40.690 --> 46:44.730]  but I mean, you don't wanna stress them out too much,
[46:44.730 --> 46:49.730]  but yeah, so we have 420 little guys in here,
[46:50.970 --> 46:51.810]  and it's just great.
[46:51.810 --> 46:53.410]  I mean, loving the consistency.
[46:53.410 --> 46:57.250]  Again, people like Clinetics are amazing to have,
[46:57.250 --> 46:59.970]  and amazing because you'll see
[46:59.970 --> 47:01.570]  everything's just very uniform.
[47:01.570 --> 47:02.850]  If you see like the tops,
[47:02.850 --> 47:04.730]  everything's very straight and uniform,
[47:05.570 --> 47:07.450]  which I love, I love that in my rooms,
[47:07.450 --> 47:10.290]  because if you don't have uniform plants,
[47:10.290 --> 47:12.170]  it screws with your environment,
[47:12.170 --> 47:14.090]  then you get pockets of cotton cold
[47:14.090 --> 47:15.890]  and pockets of really wet, dry.
[47:15.890 --> 47:18.570]  So anyways, having that stable,
[47:18.570 --> 47:22.010]  very evenness about it is just amazing.
[47:22.010 --> 47:23.970]  Yeah, you can see that there's a lot
[47:23.970 --> 47:25.450]  of really good consistency.
[47:25.450 --> 47:27.330]  It looks like you've plant trained a little bit.
[47:27.330 --> 47:28.730]  Have you taught these plants at all,
[47:28.730 --> 47:31.210]  or done any high stress training?
[47:31.210 --> 47:33.530]  My growers taught these plants,
[47:33.530 --> 47:35.810]  so they're really good at also topping
[47:35.810 --> 47:37.090]  and making sure they're consistent.
[47:37.090 --> 47:39.210]  If one is too tall, one's too small,
[47:39.210 --> 47:41.210]  they adjust accordingly, which is great.
[47:42.610 --> 47:44.050]  There's always that little bit of mitigation.
[47:44.050 --> 47:46.330]  People think that you cut a hundred plants
[47:46.330 --> 47:47.850]  and you get a hundred to root,
[47:47.850 --> 47:51.690]  that they're a hundred of the same size growable plants.
[47:51.690 --> 47:53.210]  Often they're not.
[47:53.210 --> 47:55.890]  Often there's a fair bit of variability there.
[47:55.890 --> 47:56.890]  And then there's often people
[47:56.890 --> 47:58.570]  that pick the wrong plant for their mothers.
[47:58.570 --> 48:00.650]  Pick the strongest plant you have for your mother
[48:00.650 --> 48:01.890]  instead of the weakest one.
[48:01.930 --> 48:04.530]  It's like, oh, I want flower, not moms.
[48:04.530 --> 48:05.610]  More important for me to flower.
[48:05.610 --> 48:06.730]  That is not the priority.
[48:06.730 --> 48:08.530]  Long-term genetics are priority.
[48:08.530 --> 48:10.810]  Right, right, exactly.
[48:10.810 --> 48:13.170]  Exactly, and I'm still learning about that too
[48:13.170 --> 48:14.570]  from my growers and everything.
[48:14.570 --> 48:17.690]  I mean, these plants, they're just so large still.
[48:17.690 --> 48:19.570]  They're like fan leaves, they're beautiful.
[48:19.570 --> 48:21.370]  But yeah, I'm still learning that moms
[48:21.370 --> 48:24.210]  are another beast of their own.
[48:24.210 --> 48:25.650]  I mean, it's hard.
[48:25.650 --> 48:30.650]  Mother plants are very hard to keep healthy, to keep happy.
[48:31.890 --> 48:33.450]  They require a lot.
[48:33.450 --> 48:34.810]  We're seeing the Grodan,
[48:34.810 --> 48:36.890]  and then underneath the Grodan,
[48:36.890 --> 48:41.650]  is it a Rockwell cube or is it Cocoa base?
[48:41.650 --> 48:43.130]  You mentioned earlier, I missed it.
[48:43.130 --> 48:44.210]  Yep, no worries. It's Grodan.
[48:44.210 --> 48:45.450]  Grodan on the base too.
[48:45.450 --> 48:47.210]  Yep, exactly, exactly.
[48:47.210 --> 48:49.370]  So what we have is, it's all Rockwell.
[48:49.370 --> 48:52.410]  So these are the initial Rockwell cubes that are in the domes.
[48:52.410 --> 48:56.010]  Then we have these guys that are, again, Rockwell.
[48:56.010 --> 48:58.210]  Yeah, Rockwell and Rockwell and everything.
[48:58.250 --> 49:02.650]  So, but yeah, they do do Cocoa in these cubes as well,
[49:02.650 --> 49:03.490]  I heard.
[49:03.490 --> 49:04.490]  Interesting, yeah.
[49:04.490 --> 49:05.330]  Yeah.
[49:05.330 --> 49:08.930]  But so you're doing, what, are you using crop salts
[49:08.930 --> 49:10.970]  or are you using like a branded nutrient
[49:10.970 --> 49:13.810]  or anything like that or what's your feeding system?
[49:13.810 --> 49:14.650]  We're using salts right now.
[49:14.650 --> 49:18.810]  Yeah, we're using salts just because my growers like it.
[49:18.810 --> 49:22.090]  They know you can kind of dial things in with the salts.
[49:22.090 --> 49:23.250]  I don't like liquid.
[49:23.250 --> 49:25.410]  Not to talk badly about liquid,
[49:25.410 --> 49:27.650]  but it's just, it's hauling all that liquid
[49:28.090 --> 49:29.410]  in and out of the facility really drives me nuts.
[49:29.410 --> 49:30.650]  So I'd rather salt.
[49:30.650 --> 49:32.450]  And again, you can adjust accordingly.
[49:32.450 --> 49:33.730]  It's not pre-mixed for you.
[49:33.730 --> 49:37.010]  So you can, you know, dial in if you have different strains,
[49:37.010 --> 49:38.890]  different things that they need and want.
[49:38.890 --> 49:41.890]  I have so much respect for your team now.
[49:41.890 --> 49:46.050]  Like how many times I hear people go, oh, you know,
[49:46.050 --> 49:47.770]  like I use, I use bottled jugs.
[49:47.770 --> 49:50.290]  I'm not gonna lie, as my salt base, but it's easy.
[49:50.290 --> 49:51.130]  It's close.
[49:51.130 --> 49:52.170]  It's something simple.
[49:52.170 --> 49:53.010]  It's good to go.
[49:53.010 --> 49:54.410]  They have a, but whatever.
[49:54.410 --> 49:57.330]  But when you're working in a facility this large
[49:58.010 --> 50:00.090]  and you have to pay for water, it's just like, oh my God,
[50:00.090 --> 50:00.930]  why?
[50:00.930 --> 50:01.770]  Yeah.
[50:01.770 --> 50:04.130]  There's certainly like humic and fulvic acids.
[50:04.130 --> 50:05.890]  There's some way better products that come out
[50:05.890 --> 50:08.130]  on the shelf that are actually water-based.
[50:08.130 --> 50:10.850]  And I, I suggest for stuff like that.
[50:10.850 --> 50:13.810]  And you know, like vitamin B1 is like super thrive.
[50:13.810 --> 50:14.650]  You're gonna do that.
[50:14.650 --> 50:16.610]  That's the liquid base is, is, is fine.
[50:16.610 --> 50:18.210]  But like a lot of your base nutrients,
[50:18.210 --> 50:21.170]  all they're doing is taking crop salt
[50:21.170 --> 50:23.010]  and putting it in water for you.
[50:23.010 --> 50:24.650]  And that's what my growers said.
[50:24.650 --> 50:26.690]  They're like, do you want to pay for water?
[50:26.690 --> 50:29.530]  Or do you just want the damn thing that they mix it with?
[50:29.530 --> 50:31.690]  Like, let's go, you know?
[50:31.690 --> 50:35.090]  And like I said, it's hard to, it's, it's just annoying
[50:35.090 --> 50:38.010]  to haul all that liquid through your facility.
[50:38.010 --> 50:39.930]  I mean, I was just like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[50:39.930 --> 50:40.770]  Let's do salt.
[50:40.770 --> 50:41.610]  We'll figure it out.
[50:41.610 --> 50:42.570]  Call it a day.
[50:42.570 --> 50:43.450]  And it is what it is.
[50:43.450 --> 50:46.250]  I mean, it's, it's not any harder either.
[50:46.250 --> 50:47.570]  You just got to know your mixes.
[50:47.570 --> 50:49.770]  And honestly, a lot of the salt bags,
[50:49.770 --> 50:51.530]  a lot of the companies on their websites,
[50:51.530 --> 50:53.010]  they will guide you through it.
[50:53.010 --> 50:56.610]  Like it's not as difficult as some people might think it is.
[50:57.490 --> 51:01.130]  So I mean, yeah, I really, I really love the salts.
[51:03.330 --> 51:04.170]  They work nicely.
[51:04.170 --> 51:06.930]  But that full flavor, that full flavor organic
[51:06.930 --> 51:08.090]  is something special too.
[51:08.090 --> 51:10.490]  It's really, the big thing for me is
[51:10.490 --> 51:13.010]  I don't think there's a single wrong way to grow cannabis.
[51:13.010 --> 51:14.010]  No, no.
[51:14.010 --> 51:16.930]  I think that growing cannabis is good, period.
[51:16.930 --> 51:18.970]  Like that's the period end.
[51:18.970 --> 51:21.690]  But at the same time, you know, as a chef,
[51:21.690 --> 51:25.450]  I've always leaned in towards this more ecological,
[51:25.490 --> 51:28.090]  sustainable living concept in my mind.
[51:28.090 --> 51:30.890]  So it's always like we should progress there slowly,
[51:30.890 --> 51:32.450]  but we have these things.
[51:32.450 --> 51:33.970]  Why not explore them?
[51:33.970 --> 51:34.810]  You know what I mean?
[51:34.810 --> 51:36.130]  Like, why not get into it?
[51:36.130 --> 51:37.410]  Why not check out these things?
[51:37.410 --> 51:39.850]  Why not push it through and see what happens?
[51:39.850 --> 51:41.810]  Oh yeah, we're all about experimenting.
[51:41.810 --> 51:44.770]  So do you guys use beneficial,
[51:44.770 --> 51:47.690]  you're inoculating with bacteria of any sort as well,
[51:47.690 --> 51:50.610]  or are you mainly sticking away from that?
[51:51.530 --> 51:54.170]  We use, you know what?
[51:54.170 --> 51:56.130]  That's a good question for my growers.
[51:57.210 --> 52:01.290]  We use, I believe it's enzyme, stuff like that.
[52:01.290 --> 52:03.090]  We also have to be very careful
[52:03.090 --> 52:06.490]  because there's also Health Canada approved bacterias
[52:06.490 --> 52:07.410]  and stuff like that.
[52:07.410 --> 52:09.130]  Again, my husband's more into that one,
[52:09.130 --> 52:13.370]  but there's things that we're absolutely not allowed to use
[52:13.370 --> 52:15.330]  and there's things that we're allowed to use.
[52:15.330 --> 52:17.890]  So we have to be really mindful of that.
[52:17.890 --> 52:21.730]  But yeah, when you're feeding them a lot of
[52:21.730 --> 52:23.770]  a certain type of salt
[52:23.770 --> 52:27.130]  or a little certain type of food, I guess,
[52:27.130 --> 52:30.850]  you have to kind of help them out with good bacterias,
[52:30.850 --> 52:33.850]  bad, you know, so there's a balance.
[52:33.850 --> 52:37.490]  Yeah, there's gotta be there, which is so important.
[52:37.490 --> 52:40.690]  So these are, so what do we get to see next?
[52:40.690 --> 52:42.010]  What's up next here?
[52:43.210 --> 52:44.130]  I mean, don't get me wrong,
[52:44.130 --> 52:46.210]  I could just stare at this room all day long.
[52:46.210 --> 52:47.050]  You know what?
[52:47.050 --> 52:48.690]  It's gonna be exciting
[52:48.690 --> 52:51.610]  because we're gonna see flowers soon.
[52:52.490 --> 52:54.090]  So we went children with the clones
[52:54.090 --> 52:56.090]  and now those were our teens.
[52:56.090 --> 52:58.610]  Yeah, these ones are the teenagers.
[52:58.610 --> 52:59.690]  Okay.
[52:59.690 --> 53:02.610]  And again, so everybody knows this is Grim Glue
[53:02.610 --> 53:06.010]  from Blimburn Genetics, source through Clonetics,
[53:06.010 --> 53:08.370]  is what we're having a look at here.
[53:08.370 --> 53:09.490]  Right, and I'll tell you,
[53:09.490 --> 53:14.490]  these guys are three weeks into their flower cycle
[53:15.730 --> 53:17.450]  and they are just beautiful.
[53:17.450 --> 53:19.850]  I'm gonna stand back here for a minute.
[53:19.850 --> 53:22.250]  So they are tall and happy.
[53:22.250 --> 53:24.690]  We'll go, we'll pan through the aisle.
[53:29.930 --> 53:31.730]  They're stacking so beautifully.
[53:33.050 --> 53:35.530]  There is, there seems to be a little bit of stretch
[53:35.530 --> 53:38.490]  that has happened here in the mid early flowers.
[53:38.490 --> 53:42.290]  And for me as a Canadian and in the system that I like,
[53:42.290 --> 53:45.530]  I'm not a huge fan of hugely clustered thick buds.
[53:45.530 --> 53:47.850]  It's just, it's scary.
[53:47.850 --> 53:49.090]  You know, for me, it's like,
[53:49.090 --> 53:53.690]  hey, let's create a perfect situation for mold and mildew.
[53:55.090 --> 53:55.970]  It's risky.
[53:55.970 --> 53:58.610]  So these, like this internode spacing that I'm seeing
[53:58.610 --> 54:00.170]  is something that I look for in a plant.
[54:00.170 --> 54:02.770]  These are looking really happy and really healthy.
[54:02.770 --> 54:06.930]  Oh yeah, this is, I love the Grim Glue, so good.
[54:07.770 --> 54:09.290]  I agree with you.
[54:10.530 --> 54:13.970]  When they get too bunched, I guess,
[54:13.970 --> 54:16.490]  it's kind of a scary situation.
[54:16.490 --> 54:19.930]  Again, a big, big, big thing is environment
[54:19.930 --> 54:23.570]  and just mitigating, mitigating, mitigating everything.
[54:24.650 --> 54:26.250]  So while we're in here
[54:26.250 --> 54:27.650]  and looking at these beautiful flowers,
[54:27.650 --> 54:30.490]  I'd love to ask you a little bit about your farm
[54:30.490 --> 54:31.330]  and what you're doing
[54:31.330 --> 54:35.010]  because you're not a big corporate business.
[54:35.010 --> 54:38.450]  You are a craft growers through and through.
[54:38.450 --> 54:41.090]  Well, I mean, like you're small,
[54:41.090 --> 54:43.490]  your mom and pop owned your small business.
[54:43.490 --> 54:45.050]  Can you tell me a little bit about that?
[54:45.050 --> 54:46.570]  How your business was formed
[54:46.570 --> 54:50.570]  and how you got to this beautiful flower room as it is now?
[54:50.570 --> 54:51.690]  Of course.
[54:51.690 --> 54:53.410]  So my husband actually works
[54:53.410 --> 54:55.490]  at Wayne Patrick Consumer Products.
[54:55.490 --> 54:59.810]  It was the other company that we were talking about earlier.
[54:59.810 --> 55:03.410]  And, you know, we were talking about it,
[55:03.410 --> 55:04.250]  my husband and I,
[55:04.250 --> 55:05.290]  and one day I was just like,
[55:05.290 --> 55:07.690]  why don't we just build a micro?
[55:07.690 --> 55:12.690]  Micro was the word kind of new in the Canadian license.
[55:13.650 --> 55:15.450]  It was usually mostly standard licenses.
[55:15.450 --> 55:18.370]  So when the micro license came about,
[55:18.370 --> 55:20.250]  we were just like, why don't we just do this?
[55:20.250 --> 55:21.890]  I mean, my husband has experience.
[55:21.890 --> 55:24.530]  He's worked in a standard facility for,
[55:24.530 --> 55:26.210]  I think at that time it was already like six,
[55:26.210 --> 55:27.970]  seven years he had worked there.
[55:27.970 --> 55:31.410]  And so, you know, I bought a piece of land
[55:31.410 --> 55:35.850]  and got it rezoned and it just didn't,
[55:35.850 --> 55:37.330]  it hasn't stopped from there.
[55:39.690 --> 55:41.250]  Like that comment there from Randall,
[55:41.250 --> 55:45.010]  it's like that canopy is flat as the deltas of Mississippi.
[55:45.970 --> 55:47.050]  Well done.
[55:47.050 --> 55:48.730]  Well done.
[55:48.730 --> 55:50.370]  I love some of the puns,
[55:50.370 --> 55:51.930]  some of the jokes these guys throw out.
[55:51.930 --> 55:53.370]  They're truly awesome.
[55:53.370 --> 55:54.530]  Awesome human being.
[55:54.530 --> 55:55.570]  Oh my God.
[55:55.570 --> 55:56.410]  I love it.
[55:56.410 --> 56:01.410]  And so, yeah, the micro cultivation license is so beautiful.
[56:02.330 --> 56:05.810]  It really does allow people to grow craft cannabis
[56:05.810 --> 56:07.210]  as opposed to, sorry, can you hear me?
[56:07.210 --> 56:08.330]  Cause the pans are on.
[56:08.330 --> 56:09.690]  Yeah, no, you're coming through clear.
[56:09.690 --> 56:11.010]  I'll let you know if it's terrible.
[56:11.770 --> 56:12.850]  I will tell you so quickly.
[56:12.850 --> 56:13.890]  That's amazing.
[56:13.890 --> 56:16.170]  So yeah, it allows people to do this.
[56:16.170 --> 56:17.730]  It allows for craft cannabis,
[56:17.730 --> 56:20.410]  which I think is such a beautiful thing.
[56:20.410 --> 56:24.210]  Every single plant in here is an individual.
[56:24.210 --> 56:27.290]  I, my growers and I will talk about these plants
[56:27.290 --> 56:29.770]  as if they're human beings.
[56:29.770 --> 56:30.610]  It's amazing.
[56:30.610 --> 56:34.570]  I really love the fact that my husband and I own it
[56:34.570 --> 56:35.410]  and that's it.
[56:35.410 --> 56:38.650]  My growers directly get to talk to the owners
[56:38.690 --> 56:42.010]  and we as owners directly get to make decisions
[56:42.010 --> 56:44.610]  immediately, effectively and efficiently
[56:44.610 --> 56:48.730]  so that these plants look like this every time.
[56:48.730 --> 56:51.210]  So Dave is slowly coming in on the back end here.
[56:51.210 --> 56:53.930]  So we'll just kind of open this up a little bit,
[56:53.930 --> 56:57.450]  but just as a heads up, if you can try and keep your,
[56:57.450 --> 56:58.770]  I've muted your microphone.
[56:58.770 --> 57:00.330]  So as a heads up there too,
[57:00.330 --> 57:02.770]  but if you can try and keep your phone on landscape,
[57:02.770 --> 57:04.210]  like turn sideways,
[57:04.210 --> 57:05.930]  it'll just fill the screen a lot better
[57:05.930 --> 57:08.010]  when I end up pulling you on full bar.
[57:08.650 --> 57:10.290]  That's something that's important to touch on
[57:10.290 --> 57:13.650]  is your small business owned mom and pop type of thing.
[57:13.650 --> 57:15.370]  And there was one thing that was brought up here,
[57:15.370 --> 57:17.570]  which is interesting because it is correct.
[57:17.570 --> 57:20.810]  Is there is a worldwide shortage of a lot of the salts
[57:20.810 --> 57:23.490]  and chemicals that we use to create salt based fertilizers.
[57:23.490 --> 57:26.210]  Is that something that you're worried about long-term
[57:26.210 --> 57:28.850]  or is that something that's kind of like,
[57:28.850 --> 57:32.090]  we're approaching the crossroads one day.
[57:32.090 --> 57:33.810]  Like a salt shortage?
[57:33.810 --> 57:37.610]  Yeah, more like the, yeah, essentially.
[57:38.450 --> 57:39.290]  There should be an increase.
[57:39.290 --> 57:41.330]  I've been talking to the growers and the hydroponic stores
[57:41.330 --> 57:44.090]  that there'll be an increase in the cost of goods in general
[57:44.090 --> 57:44.970]  when it comes to these products.
[57:44.970 --> 57:46.690]  You're adding salts though, not bottles.
[57:46.690 --> 57:48.010]  So which is different.
[57:48.010 --> 57:49.410]  It's helpful, but you know what?
[57:49.410 --> 57:51.770]  This market, this industry is so great
[57:51.770 --> 57:53.770]  that everyone helps each other out.
[57:53.770 --> 57:57.330]  There's no massive competition.
[57:57.330 --> 57:59.370]  There's no, everyone helps each other out.
[57:59.370 --> 58:03.530]  So whether it's, if it's a salt shortage or something,
[58:03.530 --> 58:05.230]  something will get figured out.
[58:06.190 --> 58:08.830]  There's always, there's a lot of companies,
[58:08.830 --> 58:10.830]  a lot of great companies that have salts,
[58:10.830 --> 58:12.990]  a lot of great companies that are doing the liquids.
[58:12.990 --> 58:16.150]  So as far as that, it's not too worrisome.
[58:16.150 --> 58:20.430]  It just sucks when prices go up and, you know.
[58:22.430 --> 58:23.790]  Especially with the slim margin
[58:23.790 --> 58:25.110]  that we have to deal with already.
[58:25.110 --> 58:28.150]  Exactly, well, yeah, yeah.
[58:28.150 --> 58:30.830]  I mean, we won't get into that too much.
[58:30.830 --> 58:32.590]  You know what I mean?
[58:32.590 --> 58:34.430]  Because it's the end users still paying
[58:34.430 --> 58:35.870]  the same amount as just the farmer
[58:35.870 --> 58:38.110]  that's the one really getting stiffed at this point.
[58:38.110 --> 58:40.110]  Yeah, I mean, but that being said,
[58:40.110 --> 58:41.670]  you know, I'll be flat and frank.
[58:41.670 --> 58:43.230]  When it comes to yield per square foot,
[58:43.230 --> 58:45.750]  cannabis is higher than a lot of vegetables
[58:45.750 --> 58:47.190]  and a lot of other plants.
[58:47.190 --> 58:48.650]  The expectation that we're gonna get
[58:48.650 --> 58:52.790]  the $3,500 a pound is very unlikely.
[58:52.790 --> 58:54.350]  Well, with the, let me just say that
[58:54.350 --> 58:57.830]  with the micro cultivator license that we have,
[58:57.830 --> 59:02.050]  we actually are only able through our license
[59:02.050 --> 59:06.370]  to grow 2,000 square feet of canopy space.
[59:06.370 --> 59:10.490]  So we are a little bit kind of,
[59:11.810 --> 59:12.930]  what's the word, oh my God.
[59:12.930 --> 59:14.290]  But yeah, we're not allowed to grow
[59:14.290 --> 59:16.610]  as much as the standard license, which is unfortunate.
[59:16.610 --> 59:18.770]  At the same time, that's what makes us crap cannabis.
[59:18.770 --> 59:21.090]  That's what allows us to focus
[59:21.090 --> 59:23.090]  on all our plants as individuals.
[59:23.090 --> 59:26.170]  But yeah, it just kind of sucks when I can't,
[59:26.170 --> 59:30.090]  you know, grow another room to offset some costs
[59:30.090 --> 59:32.930]  if in the future everything goes up,
[59:32.930 --> 59:34.450]  but we'll deal with it.
[59:34.450 --> 59:37.610]  I mean, we've dealt with a lot of things so far,
[59:37.610 --> 59:41.810]  my husband and I, in this whole setup of Stew Farms.
[59:41.810 --> 59:44.850]  So I mean, you know, at least everyone suffers
[59:44.850 --> 59:46.650]  if it's not just one person.
[59:46.650 --> 59:48.850]  So yeah, unfortunately.
[59:52.810 --> 59:53.650]  Awesome, well.
[59:53.650 --> 59:55.170]  And then we'll go to the next room,
[59:55.170 --> 59:56.290]  the biggest room where-
[59:56.290 --> 59:57.530]  The big flower room.
[59:58.530 --> 01:00:01.250]  Where the buds are the biggest.
[01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.810]  So our next room, the,
[01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.330]  oh, that's my glove.
[01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.010]  The next room, the flowers are at six weeks old.
[01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.250]  So like I said, they're about two,
[01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:16.730]  two and a half weeks out from harvest.
[01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:20.410]  Like I said, we let our flowers talk for us.
[01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:23.970]  So we don't really chop them down before they are ready,
[01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:26.770]  which is again, another craft cannabis thing
[01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.450]  that we're allowed to do.
[01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:30.330]  We don't have exact dates.
[01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:34.650]  We don't, we listen to our, we listen to our plants.
[01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:37.450]  So let me just back camera.
[01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:41.370]  All right, that's my glove again.
[01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.250]  Boom, boom.
[01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.890]  You gotta get you one of those filters for your camera
[01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:53.170]  because of the yellow, but it's beautiful.
[01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:54.010]  Oh, you know what?
[01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:54.850]  I have it.
[01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:56.370]  I have it in my front office.
[01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:59.650]  All right, so these, these buds are already,
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.130]  like this is six weeks out.
[01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:03.970]  They're pretty large.
[01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:05.930]  Yeah, they don't need, you know,
[01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.130]  they don't need too much,
[01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.770]  yet too much huger than that.
[01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.850]  Cause you'll get, but man, that is-
[01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:11.690]  I know you're right.
[01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:12.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:14.370]  The density, yeah.
[01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.810]  We've-
[01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:16.650]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.330]  I like a big buds too.
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:19.290]  Yeah.
[01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:20.130]  Oh my God.
[01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:21.890]  If you could only smell this room.
[01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.530]  Wait, can you describe it to us
[01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.890]  for those that don't have smell-o-vision?
[01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:30.890]  It's very, I want to almost say citrusy.
[01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.370]  There's no, I don't think there's a lot of mercine.
[01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:38.610]  I think is the one that has a lot that, that a lot of,
[01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.770]  I don't think it has a lot of mercine terpenes in it.
[01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.970]  I think it's more so lemonene and those kinds,
[01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:50.530]  but it's very citrusy, very, very pungent.
[01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:54.290]  Lemon, the lemon flavor, that citrusy flavor
[01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:57.770]  is a huge, huge variance.
[01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:58.610]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.650]  Like it's not just,
[01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:02.290]  it's not just like that typical lemon cleaner
[01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:03.130]  that we all taste.
[01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.930]  I think there's a lot of variability
[01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.450]  when we talk about lemon.
[01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:08.530]  You know, people go, oh, I hate lemon flavor.
[01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.610]  I'm like, well, it's lemon,
[01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.410]  but it's not like what you're thinking of.
[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:12.770]  Like I have, I have, you know,
[01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:14.370]  is that one's like lemon Jolly Rancher
[01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.130]  and one tastes like old woman candy.
[01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:17.730]  You know, like those lemon candies that you leave.
[01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:20.050]  And it's like, the variability is so great.
[01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:21.850]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:22.730]  You know what I'm going to do?
[01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:26.890]  I'm going to run and grab my, my lens.
[01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:27.730]  Okay.
[01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:29.730]  Do you want to, do you want to hop?
[01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.250]  I don't know if you can hear me there, Dave.
[01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.690]  Did you want to, while she's doing that,
[01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:33.570]  did you want to hop on
[01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.970]  and we can start looking through the other side?
[01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:38.650]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:40.050]  My arm was getting tired of holding it
[01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.610]  and I'm sure people are tired of looking
[01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:42.810]  at my hallway anyways,
[01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:46.890]  but this will give you an idea of the scope
[01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:49.170]  and size of this facility.
[01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:51.570]  We're looking at 25,000 square feet
[01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.290]  of actual grow space here.
[01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.090]  To my knowledge,
[01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:58.690]  it's the largest indoor tissue culture facility in Canada.
[01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:02.210]  We can do over 4 million ready to flower plants in here.
[01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:05.010]  Now, the reason why I mentioned the ready to flower,
[01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:07.450]  which is our 12 inch clone,
[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.090]  what it really does for the actual client,
[01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.210]  if they chose to,
[01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:14.170]  they could actually remove their mother clone in bedrooms.
[01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:16.890]  So this is really big for the micro world.
[01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:19.530]  To be able to actually just go in,
[01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.570]  get ready to flower plants from us,
[01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:25.770]  and then be able to put these things right in a production.
[01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:30.090]  So when we put stuff together for people like Natasha,
[01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:30.930]  they have a choice.
[01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:32.890]  They could do a four inch rooted clone.
[01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:37.650]  They can do a 12 inch ready to flower plant.
[01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:39.450]  We also have a mother program
[01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.810]  and for larger scale facilities,
[01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:43.130]  we do a mother program.
[01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:46.610]  Yeah, well, that's just.
[01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:48.890]  Natasha always says she's so proud.
[01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:49.730]  That's my baby.
[01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:50.570]  That's just amazing.
[01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:53.050]  I'm so proud of my little plants.
[01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:55.210]  That's my little child.
[01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:56.770]  Not so little right now.
[01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:57.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.810]  Nice fade happening too.
[01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:02.850]  And these are just like the little baby offshoots of it.
[01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:03.890]  It's wild.
[01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.450]  This strand is just stunning.
[01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:06.690]  I mean, it looks like diamonds.
[01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:07.730]  It looks like powder.
[01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.650]  It's always nice when you can send your kids
[01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:13.170]  over to somebody else like Natasha
[01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:14.930]  and they can grow them into adults for you
[01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:15.770]  and make them look amazing.
[01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:16.770]  Yeah.
[01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.010]  Like look at this powder.
[01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.850]  It's wild.
[01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:20.690]  It's really sexy when you send them out
[01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.330]  and you get photos and they look like crap.
[01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:25.090]  Oh, so upsetting.
[01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:28.410]  I did like this kind of grow together thing
[01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.210]  a couple of years ago where I got,
[01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:31.170]  where I did exactly,
[01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:32.530]  I sent out clones to a whole bunch of people.
[01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.490]  One guy like just destroyed them
[01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:37.130]  and harvested them in like 35, 40 days.
[01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:37.970]  It was just killed me.
[01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:42.090]  It was like, dude, like, dude, it's like 40 days, man.
[01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.210]  Like not even.
[01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:48.570]  Ah, but yes, clearly this is some epic, epic flower here.
[01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:56.030]  Just gorgeous.
[01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.430]  Well, Dave, do you want to move over to the,
[01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.390]  tell us a little bit more and move over to your,
[01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:04.230]  your area there while she's giving us these beautiful flowers?
[01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.510]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:07.550]  So as I was mentioning,
[01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:09.710]  this facility is set up for a couple of different things.
[01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:12.110]  It's set up for tissue culture.
[01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.750]  It's set up for clones, four and a half inch,
[01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.630]  six inch clones and ready to flower.
[01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.430]  So what I'm about to show you
[01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:21.830]  is what a ready to flower room looks like
[01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:25.830]  and just shows you where we can harden off the actual plants.
[01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:28.630]  And I think the viewers are going to get a bit blown away,
[01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.750]  just the size of, you know,
[01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.910]  the size and scope of this particular room.
[01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.830]  You guys just missed,
[01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.670]  we just did two rooms harvested
[01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:37.590]  and set out the door for clients.
[01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:41.150]  So I was wishing that the plants were in there, but.
[01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:44.830]  World waits for no one.
[01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:45.670]  World waits for no one.
[01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:46.510]  I was going to say,
[01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.510]  I'm also in the business of sending stuff out the door.
[01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:49.430]  So I'm happy to see.
[01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:50.270]  Yeah.
[01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:53.590]  As a nurse, as a nurse,
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.710]  being someone who's done a few cuts in my day,
[01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:56.790]  not as a nurse,
[01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.350]  but as someone who's done a few cuts in my day,
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:00.630]  it's always a little bit nicer when they're no longer
[01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.550]  in your responsibility.
[01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:04.390]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.910]  Well, I'm going to take you into these rooms
[01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:08.590]  and show you kind of like what a couple of the,
[01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.270]  the big rooms look like.
[01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.430]  Then I'll take you into the clone room
[01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.150]  and show you what, you know,
[01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.750]  Brothers Grim Grim Glue looks like.
[01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:16.430]  We're pushing out an order of 4,000
[01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:19.470]  for an outdoor grow here in the Valley in BC.
[01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:21.590]  Super excited to see what this is going to do outdoors
[01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:22.670]  for them.
[01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:25.510]  And then I can't go into all the rooms
[01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:26.950]  because of cross-contamination,
[01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.150]  but I'll take you guys through a good dose of them.
[01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.990]  Awesome.
[01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:32.110]  I just want to note that you can't see any PM.
[01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:33.870]  No PM.
[01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:35.830]  And I'm showing you the bottom nodes,
[01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:40.110]  the bottom leaves, like, oh, I love our, our facility.
[01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:42.110]  And this is what's great about Clannetics too,
[01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:45.030]  is just the cleanliness of the plants and everything.
[01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:47.350]  Like absolutely not a lick of PM.
[01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:50.790]  As long as you make sure to turn that,
[01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:53.390]  as long as you make sure to turn those fan backs on.
[01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:57.710]  Oh my God, my growers would kill me.
[01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:58.790]  Yes, yes.
[01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:01.750]  Right on.
[01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.150]  Well guys, I'm giving you an example.
[01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:05.390]  So we have six of these rooms.
[01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:07.030]  So this is Harding room number one.
[01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.550]  This will give you an example of just the size
[01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.110]  and scope of the facility here.
[01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.990]  So.
[01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.670]  Oh, I'm super excited to see too.
[01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:17.590]  Wow.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.760]  You got a, you got a finger on the top left
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.600]  of the camera there.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.880]  Watch your finger.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.720]  There you go.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.640]  Oh, sorry.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.480]  I'll switch hands.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.320]  Hold on.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.120]  This is not as easy as people usually project it.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.600]  You're when you're trying to like manage,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.760]  like you're opening domes there with one hand
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.600]  and holding a phone.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.080]  I'm like, holy shit, Natasha, you are skilled.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.560]  You're a skilled human being.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.600]  That's a beautiful set up.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.560]  So everything's on rolling rocks.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.280]  So what you see here is two levels.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.040]  We can go as high as three in each room.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.200]  And I'm going to show you a room
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.200]  that's got three levels going right now.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.880]  But this particular room here alone is 3,500 square feet
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.560]  and can be racked out into three levels.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.520]  Wow.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.360]  Wow.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.640]  So it's 3,500 square feet times three for canopy space.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.480]  That's right.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.320]  Wow.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.000]  That's like-
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.440]  Those racks are beautiful.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.320]  10 and a half thousand square foot canopy space.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.440]  Yeah.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.400]  So then when you look at this,
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.800]  you can see the light system that we have in here.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.080]  We can dial them up, dial them down.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.960]  In our mother room,
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.640]  you'll see that we only have every other light
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.560]  working right now.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.520]  Fans are physically built into the physical tables themselves
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.480]  which gives us the ability to control that as well.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.600]  That's cool.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.480]  That is a cool little bit right there.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.640]  The fan built in.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.480]  I like that.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.320]  Yeah.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.040]  So the whole room is on rolling racks,
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.760]  flex hoses, carbon filters.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.440]  May I ask what your electric bill is?
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.480]  If that's okay.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.320]  Oh, this room.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.160]  Is that a-
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.000]  You gave me a room.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.520]  This room will run you about 8,000 bucks a month.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.600]  Okay.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.440]  That's not bad.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.560]  It's not, that's not terrible
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.880]  for 10 and a half thousand square feet of canopy space.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.440]  Now when you think about how many plants
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.640]  you can actually push through here,
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.560]  it's not bad at all.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.920]  And that gives you an idea
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.520]  of just what the LEDs can really do for you.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.440]  Now, the other thing too,
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.840]  is it's probably too bright to see in here,
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.360]  but every single one of our rooms
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.760]  has their own individual HVAC system.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.760]  Our HVAC system is built for a clean room.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.640]  You can literally walk into and stand up
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.200]  in the HVAC room on the roof.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.920]  And each one of them has its own.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.720]  It's become kind of a landmark here in Kelowna.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.080]  When you drive in from the airport, you can't miss it.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.160]  It's the biggest HVAC in this entire city.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.560]  The industry that cannabis brings to a space is so helpful.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.400]  I mean, in Kelowna, it's a great space,
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.840]  but it's also a lot of challenging.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.000]  There's not a lot of money.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.440]  There's not a lot of great work.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.200]  You know, it is what it is.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.920]  But as this industry grows and develop,
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.640]  the cultural boom that's happening in the interior of BC
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.440]  through these farms, through these businesses,
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.240]  is really helping the community a lot.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.960]  We've seen a lot of growth, a lot of development,
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.760]  a lot of people just able to live a good, healthy life.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.440]  Yeah, no, it's huge.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.760]  And you know, that's one of the things
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.160]  that's been a challenge with the banks.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.320]  You know, you talk to the banks
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.760]  and they make it tough to get an account sometimes.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.600]  And I finally had to say to one bank,
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.000]  I employ like 30 people.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.120]  You're telling me you don't want their, you know,
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.360]  their TFSAs, their RSPs, their mortgages,
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.280]  their savings accounts.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.760]  And they were like, well, no, of course we do.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.640]  I'm like, well, then you need to be more supportive
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.200]  of, you know, us as an cannabis industry.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.880]  You're in a legal fucking country.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.600]  Yeah, this is a legal product.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.520]  Exactly, so either make it legal or don't,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.800]  but make up your mind, right?
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.640]  So this is another identical room.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.560]  This is Harding room number two.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.360]  So again, this gives you the idea of the scope.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.040]  So if you guys saw the last room,
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.800]  this gives you an idea that there's another full room
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.760]  like that there.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760]  And then I'm gonna take you all the way down the hallway
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.680]  first and just peek you into the tissue culture.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.280]  Cool, I'm excited for this.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.720]  I've been trying to, I've been doing,
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.320]  I've had the opportunity to chat with a few people
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.280]  who do tissue culture for a living.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.160]  And it's like quite an interesting science
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.680]  and everything going on there.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.960]  I mean, for someone who has plants
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.680]  and you know, that genetic diversity problem
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.680]  that we talked about where it could be a problem
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.240]  and handy as well, also creates a problem
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.080]  of like, how do we reproduce it?
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.360]  And then what happens when our plant
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.520]  gets bogged down with bacteria?
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.280]  This is the answer and I think it's super important.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.120]  Most exciting room in the entire building
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.320]  that I cannot open because it's a torture room.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.160]  But there's those new babies I was talking about.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.400]  They're behind those doors.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.640]  There you go.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.880]  It's a very pretty door.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.960]  If I open that door, my master grower will shoot me.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.200]  Oh my God, I would not wanna be on the end of that raft.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.040]  No way.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.520]  So this is, as you can see just the size
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.240]  and scope of this room of how big.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.680]  You're cutting out a little bit there, David.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.320]  I don't know if the internet's not great in that room.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.280]  I'll give you a minute to see if it restarts.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.360]  It's the purple lighting.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.000]  You gotta get rid of that purple.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.600]  I'm trying to keep these in a vault.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.200]  So I don't know if, can you guys hear me still?
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.040]  We can hear you.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.280]  We can hear you just fine.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.280]  Let me just pull this and do this and see what happens.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.320]  Yeah, cause you blanked out a little bit.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.920]  Do you wanna try turning your camera on and off
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.200]  on your side?
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.440]  Cause the audio is coming through.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.280]  The video should too.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.680]  Okay, so can you see me now?
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.520]  No?
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.960]  Hasn't quite reset it.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.720]  Do you wanna try leaving the studio
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.320]  and coming right back in?
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.440]  See if it'll reset it there.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.800]  Technical difficulties.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.880]  Oh, that's the problem with all the facilities.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.040]  I find that you can't get internet in them.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.400]  It's so hard.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.480]  In the specific, specific locations.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.040]  Yeah, there's steel panels, steel walls,
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.720]  insulation, all that fun stuff.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.640]  Yeah, try, try, try closing the window and coming.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.480]  Oh, there we go.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.360]  You're back.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.560]  Okay, so we're gonna try this again.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.040]  We're, we're going into the tissue culture storage area.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.080]  Cool, cool.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.280]  Gotta switch my hands here to get my phone.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.960]  So tell me if I lose you.
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.540]  Well, you gotta get to your door.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.700]  And you're good.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.180]  Yeah, the second those two doors close behind you,
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.660]  the video slips.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.060]  So, but we got a, we got a good image.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.260]  So do you want to tell us a little bit about the room?
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.700]  Yeah.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.180]  It's a bit of a bunker back here,
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.580]  but what I'm looking at right now,
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.300]  I wish you guys could see this is,
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.860]  it is full blown Maristam.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:23.860]  So maybe what I can do is when we talk about combating,
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.380]  you know, Hobslate and Viroid and different issues like that
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.940]  Maristam has been one of the tools
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.700]  that we've been using for that.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.220]  And it's been very successful.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.820]  Can you guys see this?
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.140]  It hasn't moved since the door closed behind you
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.100]  when you entered the room.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.540]  Once that door closes, the video I did.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.380]  Oh, wait, no, I see something.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.140]  I see things.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:48.980]  See that?
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.820]  Yes, we do.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.660]  Oh, wow.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.420]  Woo-hoo, we got image.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.300]  Oh, wait, no.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.700]  You see those little green dots?
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:00.620]  Yeah, you can see their leaf taken off there.
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.580]  Yeah, so those started off literally
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.140]  as the pearl of a Maristam.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:08.020]  That is the complete regeneration of a plant
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.980]  on its way from Hobslate and Viroid.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.260]  Wow.
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:13.740]  That's cool.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.460]  So that starts off, if it'll allow me,
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.260]  I need an assistant to hold open my door.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.020]  Yeah, prop that door open, maybe.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.260]  No, you get like five steps in
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.820]  and it seems to get a little bit shwonky.
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:30.820]  I love that word.
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:33.660]  It's an Adelism.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:34.500]  Oh, there you go.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.660]  There you go, we got imagery.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.060]  Oh, don't move too fast, though.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:38.900]  You gotta be really slow.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:39.740]  You see now?
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.580]  Yes.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:41.420]  Oh, wow.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.980]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.060]  So this is more stuff here.
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.980]  And so those are prop and held, right?
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.860]  So those are plantable, yeah, into mothers?
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.700]  Those can start going into mothers.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.140]  This gives you more ideas, stuff coming from Maristam.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.380]  Wow.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.020]  Aw, that's so cool.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.860]  And then, of course, we run a bunch of experiments
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:09.860]  on different things as well.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.860]  So you can tell me if you have any ideas
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.860]  that you'd like to see in the future.
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.900]  So we run a bunch of experiments on different things as well
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.620]  so you can tell me if the light goes out.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.460]  But this is kind of as they're starting to grow.
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.020]  Oh, that's so cool.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.220]  So that's an agar-based solution typically, correct?
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.500]  This is an agar solution.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:37.220]  I'm gonna share with everybody at the end of this show
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:38.980]  where Clonetics is going.
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:40.620]  I just spent a million and a half dollars
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.900]  on a new technology.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.580]  That'll take tissue culture to an entirely new level.
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.140]  In tissue culture,
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:51.420]  we generally have to touch the plant five times
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:55.780]  and you lose about 20 to 30% of your actual crop.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.460]  With this new technology and the new style
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.940]  in which we're gonna do it, less than 2% loss.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:05.660]  Holy shit, that's a huge change.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.660]  That's a huge change.
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.620]  Now, Yogi Buddy USA has asked,
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:13.180]  how many strains do you have in this room right now?
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.940]  There's 65 live lines
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:20.700]  that are growing into mothers right now.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.860]  And there's a total of 350 strains in here.
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.020]  Now, the other thing that you don't see in this room
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.660]  is Clonetics has the largest genomic mapping
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.780]  and DNA sequencing program in Canada happening.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.980]  We have over 641 lines currently popped right now
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.180]  for DNA sequencing.
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:42.060]  So this is gonna give us the ability
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:44.620]  to have the full DNA map of every one of these things.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:46.660]  And just on this shelf alone,
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:49.420]  you can see CBD Remedy by Resin,
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.540]  Hindu Kush, Rosetta Stone,
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:54.500]  another favorite by Grimm, Cinderella 99,
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.020]  the real Cinderella 99.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:02.660]  Sweets by Karma.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.900]  Got more sweets here.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.540]  Blue Sky.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.860]  Everybody in the OG community loves Lindsay OG.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.900]  It's a popular one.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.860]  Well, there it is.
[01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:20.870]  So Warlock is on here.
[01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:21.950]  Just a heads up, Natasha,
[01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:23.910]  I'm getting a lot of fan sound behind you.
[01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:26.590]  So when you speak, make sure to unmute yourself
[01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:27.870]  just as it heads up there.
[01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:29.270]  I'm turning you off in between
[01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:31.310]  because it's getting very, very loud.
[01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:33.750]  So then I'll just...
[01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:37.790]  So you can see each one of those individual tubes
[01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:38.630]  will be aligned.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.000]  That's epic.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:43.840]  That's epic.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.080]  So I mean, is it, can you,
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.360]  your regular person can get their product
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.120]  through you guys tissue cultured?
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.040]  Is that something, like,
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.840]  if you're a Canadian resident in BC,
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.840]  are you able to just tissue culture anybody's stuff?
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.440]  Or do you need special licensing
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.720]  to be able to get that to be done?
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.520]  Like, what's the process there?
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.440]  You just have to have a proper license.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.680]  So if you're a micro cultivator or an LP,
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.520]  we can do that for you.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.440]  Okay, cool.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.800]  But not quite, not quite the ACMPR levels now.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.800]  Not yet anyways.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.200]  ACMPRs can't transfer material, unfortunately.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.680]  I'm hoping they're gonna change that
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.040]  because we'd love to be able to do it for sure.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.520]  So then I'm gonna pop you across to the lab
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.180]  where they do this Meristem work,
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.620]  which by the way, blows me away.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.660]  I don't know how they even see this stuff,
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.620]  but that's gonna be a really interesting room.
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:41.380]  That's the media prep area.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.100]  And I'm gonna explain to you guys,
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.660]  so it's a little construction going on here,
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.300]  as you can see.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.220]  This is the new technology
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:50.420]  and it's an actual game changer.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:52.860]  So I can't wait to explain that to you in a bit.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.020]  So hey, Squishy Mirror says,
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.340]  how long can you keep the clones in those vile states?
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:03.780]  We can vile bank those clones forever, indefinitely.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.580]  That's crazy, cool.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:10.660]  We'll keep sub-culturing those and changing them.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:11.820]  Give you an idea.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.500]  Hey Kara, how are you?
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.500]  Good.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500]  So I just wanna give everyone a quick little look
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.340]  at the lab.
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.540]  There's four laminar flow hoods here.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.500]  This will give you the ability
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.140]  to put eight technicians to work.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.380]  Some of the techs aren't here right now,
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:26.980]  but this gives you an idea.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:30.380]  That is a huge tech lab.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.220]  It is huge.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.180]  And the other thing too, to really look at
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:35.820]  is this laboratory is hardwired
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.660]  to the University of Saskatchewan,
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.540]  the University of British Columbia, Okanagan,
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.260]  and the National Research Council of Canada.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:46.460]  We all do tissue culture and sequencing work together,
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:48.420]  and we have exclusive programs with them.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:51.140]  So this facility tied to theirs
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:54.140]  is actually about 13 different PhDs
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.460]  and 38 different master's students
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.820]  working on our projects at all times.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.020]  Yeah, the Dank Hours show is catching up.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.260]  I'm up to three PhDs.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.780]  I need to get 30 more.
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:08.460]  I'll be able to get you up to your lab.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.020]  You can borrow some of ours.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.500]  So this will give you an idea of just like
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.860]  everything in this building is fully automated
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.240]  from this center.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.180]  Oh, that's neat.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:25.100]  And it goes all the way around the corner.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.700]  Everything, fertigation, water,
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.380]  absolutely full meal deal.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:37.740]  What was the approximate setup cost of your facility
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:39.420]  if it's okay I ask?
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.660]  22 million bucks cost to put this building together.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.020]  Canadian?
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:44.860]  Canadian, yeah.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:46.980]  Canadian.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.340]  I've gotten the ability to like look
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.180]  through some other large facilities in the States.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.020]  It seems like that's a pretty level number.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.700]  Oh wow, strobe lighting.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.340]  This room was just harvested yesterday,
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.100]  but this gives you another idea of a full scope room.
[01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:09.130]  There's a little set of plants back there
[01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:12.610]  that are finishing hardening and they'll go out the door.
[01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:14.530]  I assume it's just the camera,
[01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:17.010]  but those lights do a little bit of flickering there.
[01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:18.130]  Is that normal or is that,
[01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:20.050]  that's just the camera doing that, right?
[01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:20.890]  Camera.
[01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:21.710]  I noticed that too.
[01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:24.690]  I was wondering if it was the feed or my camera.
[01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:25.810]  Sometimes some of those lights,
[01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:28.850]  they released on a variance like that
[01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:31.850]  and it can do some weird stuff to the camera.
[01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:34.630]  But because of the scope of what we have here as a facility,
[01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:37.290]  I can show you, we have pilot rooms.
[01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:40.130]  This room here is for one client alone.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:43.880]  Awesome.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.680]  So it's specific clients running large facilities
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.960]  will come to you and be like,
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.520]  hey, I need you to do this part of the procedure for me.
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.420]  Uh oh, you've lagged out a little bit.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.380]  We've entered the bunker.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.520]  Entered the bunker.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:04.940]  Tell me when it comes back on.
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.780]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.700]  You're back on.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.540]  You're good.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:08.360]  Okay, let's see.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.080]  I'll hold the door open.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.780]  Let's see how close I can get.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.380]  Yeah, the second that door closes.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:26.060]  It sounds like it's trying to catch up.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.160]  We've got this, let's see if it comes up.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.320]  Your audio, oh, there you go.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.160]  You're clear.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.000]  Working now?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:33.820]  For a moment, yeah.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.640]  Well, your audio is, we got a good picture of the room,
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.200]  at least at this point in time.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.960]  Okay, give me one sec here.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.600]  I'm gonna see if I can get someone in the hallway
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.040]  to hold the door open for me.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.880]  So how many people will be working?
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.920]  How many people did you say were working in that hood room?
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.160]  You said eight?
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.800]  Eight people in that room or four?
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.240]  Four hunters in that room.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.080]  Oh, wow.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.840]  Can you guys see this now?
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.800]  Yes, it's coming through nice and clear and great.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.040]  Yeah, we got it.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.640]  Okay, Kara volunteered to hold the door open for me.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.280]  Thank you.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.960]  Say thank you to Kara, everybody.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:18.800]  There you go, Kara.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.240]  You're awesome.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.600]  150 people say thank you.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.480]  All the automation in the world we have in here,
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.520]  you gotta hold the door open for Wi-Fi.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.320]  So this gives you an idea.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:35.320]  This is one order of 4,000 going out to an outdoor grove.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.640]  Don't break them, dude.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.480]  They're beautiful and healthy and happy.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.440]  Look at those.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.200]  Very gorgeous.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.560]  We just did a run up to sugarcane cannabis.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.440]  And the first thing they...
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.680]  Off the tops was a healthy...
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.320]  So as somebody in the industry...
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.680]  That is so critical to be a healthy clone.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.720]  That made my day.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.720]  Especially at this volume, at this number, it's so hard.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:30.120]  So this facility can do millions of those types of clones.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.080]  So I'll go save Kara from having to hold the door.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.880]  Thank you, Kara.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:41.680]  Thanks, Kara.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.960]  Okay, so last room I can go into
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.720]  without cross-contaminating here will be the mother room.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.800]  And give you guys a quick peek in there, okay?
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.240]  Yes, please.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.600]  Yes, please.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:06.040]  Unfortunately, I can see these lights are flickering again.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.160]  It does happen.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.520]  And it's going a little bit glitchy, but it's all good.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.600]  We need Kara back.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.660]  It's amazing we're able to do these things satellite
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.180]  like this even now today.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.100]  It's pretty incredible.
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.300]  Being able to tour facilities all over North America
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.780]  like this with the community is pretty badass.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.700]  I hope you all are enjoying the show thus far.
[01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:42.870]  Unfortunately, David, I cannot hear you.
[01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:44.710]  It is glitching out a little bit.
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.840]  Can you guys hear me?
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.000]  We can hear you now.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.880]  And your video's coming back.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.560]  Your video's slowly coming back.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.080]  Yeah, you're back.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.680]  Go ahead.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.360]  Okay, so you can see me?
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.200]  Yeah, we can see you.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.920]  And more importantly, you can see Roy?
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.400]  Roy is looking handsome.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.720]  We appreciate Roy.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.000]  Roy is a famous musician who's traveled all over the world.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.160]  You can't tell behind those glasses or that mask,
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.120]  but he's the man.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.520]  So tell them what you're doing, Roy.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.760]  Of course, just watering every day,
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.760]  but checking out some great new cultivars we got here.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.600]  Hingya toots.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.400]  Great clones we'll be taking off this week.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.640]  A lot of great genetics in here.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.240]  Really excited to get all this out to you guys.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.080]  Very cool.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:46.920]  Thank you, Roy.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.400]  So how many different mothers are on each table there?
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.160]  So there are-
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.000]  Or is that all one mother?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:53.960]  On each table, Roy.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.220]  On average, probably-
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.820]  And they're a mix of genetics
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.740]  or they'll be grouped in groups?
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:10.500]  We have around 30 cultivars a month.
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.740]  Well, that answers that question.
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:13.140]  So hard to hear you guys,
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.460]  because it's loud in here.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.580]  That's the HVAC.
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.580]  There's like 13 different lines in here right now
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.260]  that we have for sale,
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.580]  and we're developing more.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.620]  So as you can see,
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:35.240]  we have different mothers in different stages of growth
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.040]  after some have been harvested and now they're regrowing.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.160]  Thanks, Roy.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:46.420]  I'm gonna go outside where I can hear now.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.020]  And as you can see, guys,
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:51.020]  these are three racks in this room.
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.780]  So we'll continue to grow them out.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.460]  Wow, that is beautiful.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.180]  Just gorgeous.
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:00.740]  It's awesome to have the side-by-side image here
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:12.920]  of the mother room and then Natasha's flowers here.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.760]  It really shows-
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.960]  I'm showing my plants where they came from.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:16.800]  Exactly.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.280]  Just kind of showing them their home,
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:21.320]  their initial home.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.400]  Oh, your plants are beautiful.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.240]  I love them.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:25.080]  I love them.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:25.920]  I love them.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.760]  I love them.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.600]  I love them.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.440]  I love them.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.280]  I love them.
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.120]  I love them.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.320]  Beautiful, David.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.400]  The mothers are just stunning.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.240]  We're super happy with that.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.720]  So guys, as you can imagine,
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.600]  we have six of these big hardening rooms.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.640]  We have the tissue culture lab that you saw,
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.160]  the tissue culture storage facility.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.720]  We have the mother room that can go as high as three racks.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.200]  At one time, we had 65 independent lines growing in there.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.300]  We have the independent clone rooms.
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:00.100]  Now, I'm going to show you guys something.
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:02.820]  Now, once I go in here,
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:04.340]  this is the dirty room with construction,
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:06.780]  so I can't go any more plant rooms.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.620]  Say hi, Greg.
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:08.460]  Hey, Greg.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.420]  So what I'm about to show you
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:13.340]  is something called the Vivi Cabin.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.660]  The Vivi Cabin was developed in the Netherlands
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.260]  by a group called Visser.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:19.180]  Visser put this together
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.780]  for hard-to-flower ornamental plants,
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:26.420]  stuff like orchids and different things like that.
[01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:29.660]  So what we're looking at here now
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:34.020]  is the most state-of-the-art technology
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.220]  that you're going to find in tissue culture
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:38.340]  right here in Canada.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.220]  Epic, epic.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.500]  Hey, guys, say hi to our little 200 people.
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:46.500]  Good morning, everyone.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.820]  How are you?
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:49.580]  This is the tech crew,
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:52.180]  the guys behind the mission to make this thing work.
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:55.420]  This is the Vivi Cabin.
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:57.500]  So to give you an example,
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.800]  what we'll do is come across to the media room.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.780]  The rocks will slide into these
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.860]  Star Trek-looking garages.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.500]  They will go in there and simply be monitored
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.460]  until they're a four-inch rooted clone.
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.900]  This is an absolute game changer.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:20.900]  This cabin alone will do 1.1 million four-inch clones.
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.860]  How long does it take to produce that?
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.860]  Like as a human being doing that,
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.220]  doing that cutting and work?
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:31.060]  Like is that, that's a 24 hours a day
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.460]  you're eight people working all the time.
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:35.780]  So this particular,
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:37.980]  this is like the incubator for your babies, right?
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:39.140]  So you're going to come,
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.540]  we're going to create the tissue in the laboratory.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.220]  It'll go into an automatic media room
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:45.420]  from the automatic media room,
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.380]  it'll come across here.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:49.860]  So you're talking about four weeks in total
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:51.820]  until this is a four-inch rooted clone.
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.380]  Wow.
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.420]  In this room here,
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:03.500]  48,000 and change in seeds.
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.180]  There's only two people in the entire company
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:06.380]  with a key to this room.
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:09.460]  Wow.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:11.740]  That's the seed locker that we spoke about earlier.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:14.020]  That was one of the efforts.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.140]  Just in case anybody's gotten the ideas,
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:17.380]  there's an alarm on the outside,
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:18.780]  there's an alarm on the inside,
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:20.100]  it's wire mesh.
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:22.180]  Once you get in, you'll be in there for life.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:25.020]  I think that wouldn't be a problem
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.260]  for a lot of our followers.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.660]  I think they would very much,
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.180]  very much enjoy being stuck in a room
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.500]  with that many beans to just look at the back of you.
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.340]  It would only be fun
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:35.460]  if you could get them out and go out though.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.060]  Yeah, trying to plant them in your,
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.260]  in your mouth or something won't work very well.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:41.500]  Yeah.
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.980]  So yeah, I'm just going to kind of,
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.740]  walk out and then show you the viewing room,
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:50.140]  which will show you again, the RTF room,
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.700]  and then I'll sign off and go back up to my computer.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:54.500]  Awesome.
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.340]  Appreciate that.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:56.700]  This has been an awesome facility.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.700]  Thank you for taking the time to,
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.940]  to go through and do all of this with us.
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.900]  It is a ton of work for,
[01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.620]  for people to set up cameras,
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.260]  come talk with us for an hour and a half,
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.860]  make sure their facility is ready to go,
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.860]  do all these little things.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:13.180]  So like shout out and thank you
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:16.060]  to both of you for taking the time
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.900]  to show us your beautiful facilities.
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.740]  I'll give you one more sneak peek behind
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:24.580]  kind of what we love.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:27.460]  See that board?
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:31.300]  That's all our breeders
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.380]  and that's the gold seal that certifies
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:36.660]  this is an actual breeder certified plant.
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.380]  Very, very cool.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.460]  Can you zoom in a little bit
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:43.060]  so people can see the whole lineup there of your breeders?
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.280]  TH seeds, Carmen genetics,
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.880]  GGG out of the US,
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.280]  Indian land race exchange,
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.840]  Temple garden,
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.000]  Breeder Steve,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.120]  resin seeds from Spain,
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.520]  Requiem from Spain,
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.760]  Brothers Grimm from Colorado,
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.640]  Nomids, Africa seeds,
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.840]  Medcan, which is Breeder Steve's Columbia line,
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.760]  and then Sonic seeds.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.240]  If anybody's ever seen the movie Pineapple Express,
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.480]  UK pineapple came out of Sonic's stable.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.800]  Cool.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.640]  That's cool.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.000]  That's what the badge looks like.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.080]  So that'll be on packages
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.800]  on the Canadian legal market
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:34.040]  that'll certify that this genetic is from you
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.880]  and from your level.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:36.960]  Yep.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.240]  Oh, and there goes our ops manager,
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.080]  master grower.
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.000]  Okay, cool.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.760]  I will sign off and then sign back in.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.320]  Awesome, we appreciate it.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:49.960]  Thanks guys.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.040]  All right, you're stuck with me now, Natasha.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.000]  So tell me a little bit about like the challenges
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.240]  and things that you go through
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.800]  and what you know we'll do right now too,
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.640]  while we're at it,
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.960]  is we'll just give a quick shout out to our sponsor.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.400]  I wanted to say thank you again
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.760]  to our sponsor, Green Amber.ca for your support
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.880]  and definitely go check out their amazing lighting.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.360]  You can find out about their information
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.280]  at the link in the description.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.480]  They have one of the highest efficacy lights
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.040]  available in the North American market.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.720]  Their LEDs and beautifully powered.
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.560]  I got to play with one
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.600]  and I'm going to be getting one in the garden here too.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.400]  Don't be afraid to check it out.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.520]  If you're looking for LEDs, this is the place to go.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.600]  But Natasha, so can you tell me a little bit,
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.720]  maybe, you know, while we're on that,
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.640]  let's talk about your lighting
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.840]  because I see you're using it in old school.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.280]  Oh yeah, we got the horsepower here.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.080]  We got HPS bulbs.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.760]  Not a lot of people,
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.600]  well, I don't want to say that,
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.880]  but a lot of people are using LEDs
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:44.680]  and for a number of good reasons,
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:45.880]  one being the heat.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.000]  So if you want to talk about challenges,
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.120]  the one big challenge with high pressure sodium bulbs
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.600]  is the heat.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.400]  It fucking feels like you're in the sun
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.680]  without the pants on, like, let me tell you,
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.320]  like, I feel like I'm in Florida.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.480]  But so that's one of the biggest challenges here
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.560]  is just environment.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.560]  With heat comes, you know, dryness.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.760]  Sometimes if we pull back, you get a little bit more damp.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.520]  So it's just about controlling the environment.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.160]  So when we first built this building,
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.120]  we were actually in soil.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.040]  And why is that?
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.680]  Because soil allows,
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.400]  there's a lot of forgiveness with soil versus rockwool.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.800]  Rockwool, if you have an environment that they can't handle
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.120]  or some other thing that they can't handle,
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.000]  they'll die within 48 hours
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.400]  versus soil will give them about seven,
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.080]  five to seven days before you figure it out,
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.200]  fix it and help your plants out.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.400]  So one of our biggest challenges in the beginning
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.920]  was environment.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.200]  Then when we got a hold of that in our HVAC system,
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.600]  then I switched it up on everyone.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:59.920]  And my four growers are just amazing and patient with me.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:00.840]  But I said, you know what?
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.480]  We got our environment down.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:04.400]  Now we're gonna move to rockwool.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.000]  And so one of the biggest challenges with rockwool
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.320]  is just feeds and how dry we need to keep,
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.000]  or how wet we need to keep them,
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.200]  overfeeding, underfeeding.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.680]  So we're still getting a handle on that.
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.200]  Very, very temperamentally.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.120]  Very temperamentally, yes.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.440]  It's just, I know we can handle it now
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.160]  just because we got the environment down pat,
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:28.000]  but it's been challenging.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.480]  It hasn't been the easiest, but you know what?
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.320]  If our buds look like this, I'm happy.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.080]  So we can only go up from here, hopefully.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.960]  I'd smoke, I'll let everybody know right now,
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.720]  I will happily smoke that plant at any point in time.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:42.680]  No problem.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.680]  If you're looking for testers, I'm here.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.720]  So David's come back and joined us.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.000]  Natasha, did you wanna come out?
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.200]  And we'll kind of run through the last little bit
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.360]  and we'll have a chat and say goodbye to the peoples
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.320]  and run through the stuff.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.920]  Because I think this is awesome,
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.000]  what you guys have done here and taking the time to show us.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.680]  A lot of the community has said thank you.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.760]  Gorski has asked from us,
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:11.360]  what do you have from Breeder Steve Yo?
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.440]  So we have multiple different lives
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.840]  from Breeder Steve right now.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.840]  We've got the, sorry, the Beaver's Breath, Blockhead.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:29.400]  Like we've got some of his old winners and stuff.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.640]  If you reach out to me at David at Clonetics,
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.400]  I will actually send you a whole list
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.080]  of everything we have from Breeder Steve.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:39.920]  Awesome.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.840]  Like I was saying, we have his outdoor line now
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.880]  from Medcan in Columbia.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.040]  That line there, all growing outdoor.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.680]  And you're seeing numbers as high as 26% outdoor grown.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:52.560]  So some very cool stuff.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.600]  But just like some of the stuff that we have in our vault
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.960]  that we'll be developing is like,
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.600]  I would say a Blockhead hasn't been seen
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.080]  in the market for 30 years.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.760]  We literally-
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:03.600]  You know it has not.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:04.440]  Yeah.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.520]  Sorry to cut you off there.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.440]  I got excited because it literally has not.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.600]  It's one of those things that's a BC thing
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.440]  and like people don't know it, right?
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.600]  Can you talk about that a little bit?
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.080]  Yeah, so that's the cool thing about,
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.600]  Steve living eight minutes away,
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.480]  he just showed up and when we were doing our declaration,
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.800]  he was like, hey, I'm gonna trust you
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.920]  with some of my prized possessions
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.280]  that I've had basically for 20, 30 years.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.000]  And that was one of the things we did with all the breeders.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.920]  We said, hey, we get one chance for a declaration here,
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:40.960]  pull the stuff like that's in your fridge, under your bed,
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:44.240]  hidden at your buddy's house, like let's get it all.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.160]  So he came in and literally had this little vial,
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.960]  like the last 20 Blockhead seeds.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:52.800]  That's it.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.200]  Oh, wow.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.920]  So they're downstairs.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.680]  And something else we're gonna do really cool
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.360]  and we'll be inviting Natasha too
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.680]  is we're gonna have a breeder symposium once a year.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:06.280]  Now that COVID is kind of under control a little bit.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.480]  We're gonna fly our breeders into Canada here
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.920]  and we're gonna have a weekend get together
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.600]  and look at all these sequencing
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.120]  and all the different stuff we've been doing.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.280]  And then we're gonna start looking at collaborating
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.160]  and breeding together with our clients and our breeders.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.080]  That's super cool.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.780]  Will you guys be at Grow Up this year?
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.140]  So one of our reps, Mike Brown, our VP of BizDev
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.500]  will be out there just kind of touring the floor.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.340]  And I think there's some kind of like speed dating thing.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:37.500]  That we are doing.
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.300]  Yeah, so Mike lives in Nanaimo.
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:40.700]  So he's gonna go.
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:43.660]  I went and spoke at the one in Niagara a couple of,
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.260]  well, it seems like a couple of years ago.
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:47.580]  It was probably four years ago now with COVID.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:50.260]  So I did that one.
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:52.340]  We just did the show here in town,
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:56.100]  which was like a lot of locals and stuff, as you know.
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:58.040]  London, you met us there.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.940]  So very cool.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:01.820]  It was pretty awesome.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:02.780]  It was a good conference.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:04.620]  Nice to meet locals and people in the space
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:07.140]  that you don't normally get the chance to be in front of.
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:09.100]  No, it was very cool.
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.020]  I'm gonna give you guys kind of something really cool
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.700]  and just show you why it's so much fun
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.060]  to be around these breeders and stuff.
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.620]  And clients like Natasha,
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.680]  you get to see all these super cool things people are doing.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.520]  So I wanna introduce you guys to,
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:27.520]  this is the first terpene infused sparkling wine
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.560]  that was invented and patented
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.880]  by Enrico Bouchard from Requiem.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.280]  He's like a genius.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.800]  It's wow, the stuff that he comes up with.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.920]  This particular stuff,
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.680]  like everybody talks about THC and CBD
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.200]  and that kind of stuff.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.320]  This particular stuff,
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.000]  we sat around and drank about five bottles of one day
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.320]  and we went out for dinner, not just the two of us.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.960]  There was like six of us or seven of us.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.440]  We sat around and we were having dinner
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.080]  and I said to the guys across the table,
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.600]  is anybody just like floating in their place?
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:04.320]  Right?
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.440]  So I'm telling you,
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.360]  I'm really, really thinking about coming out with a line
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.040]  that's just called the Terps Collective.
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:16.040]  Forget about how much THC is in it, CBD, just terps.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.520]  And let's see how the public react to it.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.360]  That's interesting.
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.440]  I think that that's an area
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.480]  that needs to be focused on a lot more.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:27.160]  And I think that 35,
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.280]  those really high end quality products
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.360]  that are gonna come out in the market
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.360]  that I think will happen in the next five or so years
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.200]  when the market's ready
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.480]  or when people are ready to put it out there.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.920]  And I think those really high end, that Grand Marnier,
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:40.680]  that Louis Trance level quality,
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.040]  that'll come out, that really expensive high end stuff,
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.040]  that it's gonna be less about the level of THC and CBD
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.440]  and more about the unique flavor profile,
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.960]  their unique terpene profile that they have
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.240]  and being different than everything else.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.960]  Something that you can identify as being,
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.640]  hey, this is this and it's special because of this,
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.440]  I think is where we're gonna be looking forward to going to.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.160]  Well, you guys can't actually see it, I don't think,
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.120]  but on the back of this bottle,
[01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:17.830]  back of this bottle, see that says Chocoloat?
[01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:19.590]  Chocoloat?
[01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:23.150]  That's the actual strain that these terpenes came from.
[01:43:24.190 --> 01:43:25.030]  Cool.
[01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.870]  That's cool.
[01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:29.710]  So they're also not using botanical terpenes,
[01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:31.070]  they're using actual cannabis terpene.
[01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:33.590]  Oh no, he actually applied for
[01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:36.950]  and got the first patent for terpene extraction.
[01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:41.070]  So cool, so epically cool.
[01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:44.230]  So this is what is like so wild
[01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:45.630]  about being around these breeders,
[01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:48.830]  A, the stories and stuff they tell from the old days
[01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:51.110]  and that kind of stuff, it's just incredible.
[01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:53.070]  So we're super blessed.
[01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:56.350]  And then to be able to combine them with our science teams
[01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:57.990]  throughout the different universities.
[01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:59.230]  And I can tell you something else,
[01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:02.550]  when we did this structure to bring the breeders in-house
[01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:05.470]  and have exclusivity, the majority of them,
[01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:07.790]  I would say 90% were more excited
[01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:10.390]  about how they were gonna take their strains
[01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:12.870]  and find out what could be done scientifically with them
[01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:17.230]  as far as medicines and different breeding techniques
[01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:20.830]  than they were about earning from sales of genetics.
[01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:24.630]  So it was very cool to see how bought in they were
[01:44:24.630 --> 01:44:26.790]  to the scientific side as well.
[01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:29.470]  These people are so passionate and that's what they want.
[01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:32.670]  They want to do, they want to experiment.
[01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:33.670]  They don't give a fuck.
[01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:35.950]  They just want to experience things in life
[01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:38.270]  and try all the things and do all the new stuff.
[01:44:38.710 --> 01:44:42.030]  That type of energy, people, like in restaurants,
[01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:44.870]  we would try and find cooks and chefs and people like that.
[01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:47.150]  Trying to surround yourself with that is just so hard.
[01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:49.030]  It's so cool to see that you've surrounded yourself
[01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:50.510]  with that and you've been able to really be able
[01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:52.830]  to dig into that quite well.
[01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:54.950]  We are getting a little bit into this show.
[01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:58.830]  So we would love to know where we could catch both of you
[01:44:58.830 --> 01:45:01.590]  and where we can see what's going on in your lives
[01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:02.750]  as well as follow you all.
[01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:06.110]  So unless there are any last announcements
[01:45:06.110 --> 01:45:07.910]  or things you guys wanna bring up,
[01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:09.350]  we'll go into that.
[01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:14.590]  No, for me, I can't wait to see the Cushcraft
[01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:17.470]  and Stew Farms kill it with that bread
[01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:19.030]  and get it on the shelves, man.
[01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:22.590]  We're gonna set a trend here, Natasha.
[01:45:22.590 --> 01:45:23.670]  I can't wait.
[01:45:23.670 --> 01:45:24.510]  I'm so excited.
[01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:27.750]  Like I love science, that we're all about that.
[01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:30.110]  My grower went to school for it.
[01:45:30.110 --> 01:45:32.790]  We're all about experimenting, how we can do better,
[01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:33.630]  what we can do.
[01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:37.510]  So I'm really excited to see what we can do in the future.
[01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:40.190]  So where can we catch you, Natasha?
[01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:41.670]  Where can we check out your farm?
[01:45:41.670 --> 01:45:42.790]  What can we do to follow you
[01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:44.430]  and support you in the community?
[01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:46.630]  We're just on Instagram.
[01:45:46.630 --> 01:45:48.630]  It's my personal and my business
[01:45:48.630 --> 01:45:50.990]  because I am Stew Farms, me and my husband.
[01:45:52.230 --> 01:45:55.150]  My handle is Queen.period.of.the.green.
[01:45:56.590 --> 01:45:58.590]  Queen.period.of.the.period.green.
[01:45:58.590 --> 01:46:03.590]  I will pop a link to that into the description
[01:46:03.670 --> 01:46:05.510]  a little bit later today.
[01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:06.630]  David, what about yourself?
[01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:08.990]  Where can we keep in touch and check out with Clonetics
[01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:10.510]  and what's happening?
[01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:11.990]  Yeah, clonetics.com.
[01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:13.750]  We just redid our site there.
[01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:14.830]  We had a lot of fun doing it.
[01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:16.510]  It's a little hipper than the corporate sites
[01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:18.670]  I'm used to building in the past.
[01:46:18.670 --> 01:46:19.910]  So that took some getting used to.
[01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:21.990]  We picked out some cool songs to go along with it.
[01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.830]  So that was fun.
[01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:28.310]  And then of course, Clonetics Inc. is our Instagram handle.
[01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:30.190]  And we post a lot of stuff there
[01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:32.390]  about what's coming and what we're doing.
[01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:36.510]  And then for me, it's just david.clonetics.com.
[01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:40.390]  So reach out and let's talk about how we can work together.
[01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:41.950]  Awesome, and like I said, all that stuff
[01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:44.430]  is linked in the description below.
[01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:48.310]  We'll give one last thank you to our awesome sponsor,
[01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:52.070]  Green Amber Canada at greenamber.ca
[01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:55.830]  with their LED1 cannabis, Grow Light.
[01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:56.910]  You can find their information
[01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.110]  and link in the description below.
[01:46:58.110 --> 01:47:00.830]  Also, I gotta ask, do you know or will you
[01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:04.030]  or any of the people that you work with be going
[01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:07.590]  or submitting competition product to the Unicorn Cup
[01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:10.310]  in the Kootenai's BC this year?
[01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:15.310]  We won't be, because we don't flower.
[01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:17.870]  You won't be, but maybe some of the lines,
[01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:19.190]  you know if any of those will be entered
[01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:21.110]  into the cup by some of the local?
[01:47:21.110 --> 01:47:23.710]  I don't know if any of our lines are being entered.
[01:47:23.710 --> 01:47:26.430]  We just did, as you know, where we met,
[01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:28.110]  we sponsored the AR Cannabis Cup.
[01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:30.950]  So there could be some of our stuff growing there
[01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:32.310]  through some of our people for sure.
[01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:35.190]  But nobody's let us know yet.
[01:47:35.190 --> 01:47:36.030]  Yeah, cool.
[01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:37.310]  They're just starting up.
[01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:39.310]  We're actually, we've media partner with them to do,
[01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:41.630]  they're doing a cannabis competition in comparison.
[01:47:41.630 --> 01:47:44.390]  They have like Kevin Jodry, BC Bubble Man,
[01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:47.790]  Dragonfly Earth Medicine, a huge list of amazing speakers
[01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:48.630]  that'll be there.
[01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:49.470]  And because we're in the Kootenai's,
[01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:51.950]  I thought, you know, maybe somebody will put something
[01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:53.710]  for it that'll be part of your branding.
[01:47:53.710 --> 01:47:56.390]  But again, thank you both for taking the time
[01:47:56.390 --> 01:48:01.030]  and spending a morning of cannabis for breakfast with me.
[01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.870]  Awesome.
[01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:03.230]  Thank you so much for having us.
[01:48:03.230 --> 01:48:04.390]  My first podcast.
[01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:07.590]  All right, now we got to do the wave
[01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:08.830]  while the broadcast ends.
[01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:10.790]  So everybody waves like we're on Cheers.
