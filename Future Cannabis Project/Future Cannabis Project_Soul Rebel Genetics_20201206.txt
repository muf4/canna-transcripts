[00:00.320 --> 00:07.860]  And we are live. Welcome everyone. It's two o'clock on the Pacific Coast. Whoops. That's
[00:07.860 --> 00:18.000]  me, Peter. We decided to go Brady Bunch opening sequence with actually two or three people.
[00:18.000 --> 00:26.520]  There's one more. Yeah. We actually have those other slots with people. But so I'm looking
[00:26.520 --> 00:35.080]  down at you, Simon, and we're talking to Microbe Alchemist, who is behind Soul Rebel Genetics.
[00:35.080 --> 00:39.840]  And I didn't realize this would be such a contentious episode. I thought I'd have an
[00:39.840 --> 00:48.480]  easy day of what we had Joda Erb to start the day and then James Loud and suddenly.
[00:48.480 --> 00:55.200]  So what's going on? You got a whole crew of people.
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.760]  Got everyone here. I think we're just missing one person. But yeah, definitely going to
[00:59.760 --> 01:04.680]  be in for it's going to be a good one. Interesting to say the least.
[01:04.680 --> 01:13.680]  Nate, I think we can. Nate, how's the audio? Can you hear us? All right. Well, anyway,
[01:13.680 --> 01:18.000]  why don't you kind of talk about I mean, I thought it'd be interesting to have you
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.880]  talk about. Is my sound working? Sorry to interrupt. It sure is. All right. What's going
[01:24.880 --> 01:33.560]  on, everyone? Welcome, Nate. Nate, I'm going to mute you because I can't hear myself. Or
[01:33.560 --> 01:40.120]  do you have headphones? Yeah, I could actually probably turn the volume down here a little
[01:40.120 --> 01:47.150]  bit in the preferences. Yeah, it's a wee bit loud. All right. And I'm going to mute
[01:47.150 --> 01:55.950]  you for a second. All right. So let's throw it back to you. You're East Coast, right?
[01:55.950 --> 02:06.070]  Yes. New England, tri-state area. Yeah. Down near New York, basically. But so talk about
[02:06.070 --> 02:11.350]  because I think it was one of these guys who had mentioned you and recommended you.
[02:11.350 --> 02:19.230]  And that's how I came upon you. So you want to talk about kind of your journey because
[02:19.230 --> 02:24.670]  you grow other stuff. I mean, you grow plants in general, right? Yeah. You grow family history.
[02:24.670 --> 02:30.350]  Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I've been in the soil for since I was like a little little baby,
[02:30.350 --> 02:39.430]  you know, but do micro greens, do just greenhouse vegetables and stuff like that. And thanks
[02:39.430 --> 02:47.750]  for the famine and myself. But yeah, man, I just I love growing food, plants in general,
[02:47.750 --> 02:54.230]  the soil. It's interesting to me. So, you know, eventually trying to you know, I've
[02:54.230 --> 03:00.150]  always smoked. So that started it and I never pulled off a good run. And then when you finally
[03:00.910 --> 03:06.070]  do it, you know, you get a good run out of it and then you really start to dig in and
[03:06.070 --> 03:11.750]  push it. And I fell down the rabbit hole with soil and organics and all that. It's just
[03:11.750 --> 03:21.740]  definitely been an interesting journey, to say the least. I just realized that we can
[03:21.740 --> 03:26.940]  only max out at 10 people. So it told me that someone's trying to enter, but they can't.
[03:26.940 --> 03:36.180]  So, yeah. Well, anyway, we can have people jump on and off. But what what can we just
[03:36.180 --> 03:42.060]  go around the horn and talk about what drew you? I mean, you guys are each growing his
[03:42.060 --> 03:48.660]  genetics, right? So can you guys talk about what you're growing and how it's doing and
[03:48.660 --> 03:55.700]  how you came across them? Mike, why don't we start with you a second timer, second time
[03:55.820 --> 04:00.580]  panelist? Right now, I don't have anything going right now. I'm in the middle of shutting
[04:00.580 --> 04:07.860]  the tents down, building a room out, but I've grown poison mimosa, purple tapes, Havana
[04:07.860 --> 04:13.220]  Nights, the murderous precision and the boom bat. And I mean, they've all been awesome.
[04:13.220 --> 04:19.100]  But my favorite so far has been the purple tapes. And it's just like a different type.
[04:19.100 --> 04:22.900]  Like every time I pop a jar open, it's just like a different like, whoa, what is that?
[04:22.900 --> 04:28.180]  Like, you know, I've always got like good reactions from everybody and the effects are
[04:28.180 --> 04:34.820]  like beneficial for the stuff that I'm looking for. And so the purple tapes was my favorite.
[04:36.860 --> 04:45.380]  Yeah, I don't have much going on right now of his stuff, but the poison mimosa I had
[04:45.380 --> 04:50.220]  just bought from him and then I was hooked, you know, and I was posting pics and stuff.
[04:50.220 --> 04:55.700]  And then he hit me up, asked me if I wanted to be a tester. And of course, I said, yeah.
[04:55.700 --> 05:01.580]  And I got the purple tapes. And it's just been awesome, like, ever since.
[05:01.580 --> 05:10.840]  Got it. And how about Terpikami? Where are you?
[05:10.840 --> 05:18.840]  I'm in Southern California. I'll be in North Carolina in July. I'm moving up there to finish
[05:18.840 --> 05:25.160]  up my second round of school. I got my first bachelor's degree in sustainable ag and then
[05:25.160 --> 05:31.280]  I'm getting into general biology now. But I think I started testing, I just started
[05:31.280 --> 05:40.120]  testing for you. I think I got the first batch of it. I can't remember. But then I started
[05:41.120 --> 05:49.800]  the same stuff Mike has. I just a couple of the GMO poison mimosa crosses. Those came
[05:49.800 --> 05:53.960]  out great. It was just a faster finishing GMO. I pulled one plant out of a one gallon.
[05:53.960 --> 06:00.600]  That gave me like well over, I mean, it's probably, I don't know. It was probably close
[06:00.600 --> 06:06.840]  to two and a half or like three ounces. That was cool. It's just like a faster finishing
[06:06.840 --> 06:11.320]  GMO that smells like the poison mimosa, like the purple taste. Like Mike said, the purple
[06:11.320 --> 06:16.320]  taste was my favorite. Those heads were super sandy and it yielded well. And it was just
[06:16.320 --> 06:20.400]  super, it was like super symmetrical structure. So that was super nice. Someone who likes
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.000]  to make hash, I think that's one that will run again. Especially a couple of those phenos
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.480]  that I found just because, yeah, the heads were like so sandy and they looked really
[06:29.480 --> 06:36.200]  great under the scope. So that'll be cool. And then now I have the paletas or the elsa
[06:36.360 --> 06:43.800]  we're going. And I think something else. Oh, the East Coast orange. I think we popped those.
[06:43.800 --> 06:49.560]  And then I want to say something else, but I'll have to, let me text my buddy and I'll
[06:49.560 --> 07:12.750]  see what he's got going right now. Sorry, I didn't realize I was muted. I kept saying
[07:12.750 --> 07:16.910]  like Larry, I want to go next. And you're just kind of sitting there and I was like,
[07:16.910 --> 07:23.950]  take your time, Larry. All right, Larry, you got to unmute yourself. And there you go.
[07:25.790 --> 07:33.390]  No, yeah. Well, I first heard about microbalcamus when I ran into Rez Brandon last year at the
[07:33.390 --> 07:39.790]  Cannabis Grow Expo. And he had a, I guess he had some poison mosaic I'd grown out and he gave me
[07:39.790 --> 07:43.550]  a sample of it. And he reminded me of like some like old school strains, like maybe it was like
[07:43.550 --> 07:46.990]  more of the dermic coming out of it or something. But like I really enjoyed that strain.
[07:47.550 --> 07:52.350]  I started looking to microbalcamus and his genetics. And I think the first one that I
[07:52.350 --> 07:56.270]  purchased were the purple tapes and then the jungle love. The jungle love had some fruity
[07:56.270 --> 08:03.550]  turps to it. It was like a more tall, tall strain on it. The purple tapes were more shorter,
[08:04.270 --> 08:07.710]  shorter plants and stuff like that. They yielded well. They had more of a
[08:07.710 --> 08:14.350]  chemi, more like a chemi grape turps to it. That one really stood out to me.
[08:15.070 --> 08:22.990]  Right now I'm growing the East Coast Orange and also the White Widow Cross with the poison mosa.
[08:23.630 --> 08:30.910]  And right now they're doing well. The White Widow's 39 days into flower. The East Coast
[08:30.910 --> 08:36.670]  Orange is about day 40. Let's see if I get the camera to switch around.
[08:38.350 --> 08:40.670]  What? How do I get the camera to switch around?
[08:41.950 --> 08:48.750]  Oh, you got to hit the sprocket icon and then pick it, go into video and pick the
[08:49.790 --> 08:51.310]  camera on the other side of the phone.
[08:53.550 --> 08:55.230]  There's only the camera and audio setting.
[08:55.870 --> 09:02.350]  Yeah, so tap camera settings and then pick a different camera from the drop down.
[09:04.270 --> 09:08.190]  This is real time tech support. Look at that.
[09:08.190 --> 09:08.990]  There you go.
[09:18.840 --> 09:25.080]  But like this one right here is the East Coast Orange. I'm going to focus.
[09:26.040 --> 09:33.400]  It's coming off real frosty. This is another different one over here.
[09:37.460 --> 09:40.820]  You said it's like a sweet diesel that was coming through?
[09:40.820 --> 09:45.460]  One of them. The other one is more like a like a mellow hash smell to it.
[09:46.660 --> 09:49.780]  These ones are the White Widow Crosses.
[09:51.140 --> 09:56.180]  They're more shorter plants compared to the other ones, probably from the White Widow side.
[09:57.140 --> 10:03.530]  That was good. What about the Bangarang ones that you grew out and crossed?
[10:05.050 --> 10:13.450]  The Bangarang ones, I ended up with males. So I chose the biggest male out of them. And right here
[10:14.410 --> 10:19.050]  is actually a cross with the cross, the Bangarang cross to res Brandon's Magillan.
[10:20.170 --> 10:21.050]  Oh, city fire.
[10:21.050 --> 10:24.650]  So these are right here. They're all pretty much like big, bushy plants.
[10:24.730 --> 10:28.330]  Big, bushy plants are probably going to go like more than 60 days for sure.
[10:29.690 --> 10:33.210]  Yeah, but definitely 77.
[10:35.130 --> 10:40.250]  Then at first I thought they were males until they started like showing a little pre-flowers,
[10:40.250 --> 10:45.450]  but even the pre-flowers are growing out right here. They're growing into little buds down there.
[10:45.450 --> 10:51.290]  So I was all tripping on that. But so far, no hermit shoes, no nothing. Everything's going
[10:51.290 --> 10:56.010]  smooth with them. And then I also have a male outside that I'm just letting grow out and see
[10:56.010 --> 11:01.530]  how he does. I'll possibly make F2s with him. So see how they do and stuff like that.
[11:03.210 --> 11:08.970]  But this is just some other stuff I've grown out. Then I think some of these down here,
[11:10.490 --> 11:17.130]  like this one, Poison Mosa F3, and a couple other ones.
[11:17.130 --> 11:29.140]  Just another stuff going on in the works. But other than that, I like the genetics. Everything's
[11:29.140 --> 11:35.300]  real chill. So I can soil only, mostly grown with just tap water. I don't even pH and stuff like
[11:35.300 --> 11:40.900]  that. So I just like to see how things run the first time around with any type of issues,
[11:40.900 --> 11:45.780]  if they're going to need any nutrients or anything like that. But everything so far so good.
[11:47.060 --> 11:49.940]  Rocking with that Cali tap water, bro. Crushing it.
[11:49.940 --> 11:58.740]  Yeah, we actually get our water from the Colorado River. It comes through our place over here,
[11:58.740 --> 12:02.900]  and then we actually send it to like LA and San Diego and stuff like that.
[12:04.820 --> 12:13.460]  I'm mostly in the agricultural area. So yeah, like right now it's mainly vegetable production
[12:13.460 --> 12:19.380]  down here and stuff like that. They grow food year-round over here. It never rains, never snows,
[12:19.460 --> 12:23.140]  and stuff like that. So we're not- It's cold as hell over here right now.
[12:24.100 --> 12:30.660]  Like 30 degrees, bro. 30 degrees outside. No, yeah. That's like our night temps right there,
[12:30.660 --> 12:36.420]  like these past two days. But right now we're just hitting like 70, 40, and it's going to be like 60,
[12:36.420 --> 12:39.380]  40, something like that. I know Rick's cold up there.
[12:40.260 --> 12:44.180]  Yeah. So we pretty much have plants outside. So like, well, I just have the males outside,
[12:44.180 --> 12:48.020]  and they're still going. And I haven't watered them in a couple of days, and they're just going
[12:48.020 --> 12:54.500]  at it. That's what's up. But yeah, everything's going real good, though.
[12:58.090 --> 13:02.730]  So Nate, let's see if we can hear you. But you got to unmute the mic.
[13:03.770 --> 13:04.970]  This here? Yeah.
[13:04.970 --> 13:08.330]  You guys, everyone hear me there? We can hear you, bro.
[13:09.130 --> 13:13.850]  We can hear you, bro. Nice. Yeah. So I actually,
[13:13.850 --> 13:23.450]  let me think here. I got too many genetics going right now. So I met Micro back in a couple years
[13:23.450 --> 13:30.090]  ago. I actually reached out for the PDF files. I was working in a- I was a microbiologist working
[13:30.090 --> 13:43.290]  in a lab at that point. But I think what I have ran of his so far, we have zest and sun god that
[13:43.290 --> 13:52.170]  we have in the commercial facility that I run over in right over off the strip there in Vegas.
[13:53.370 --> 14:03.690]  We just ran- we just set a screwdriver in to rotation. And then here at home, I'm actually
[14:03.690 --> 14:09.850]  stuck in trim jail right now. I've got two phenos of death face that I'm trimming up right now that
[14:09.850 --> 14:14.090]  actually finished off real nice. I probably could have let them go another week or so, but
[14:14.810 --> 14:21.130]  I get antsy when I get plants behind them ready to go. What else? I think the murderous precision
[14:21.130 --> 14:28.410]  is another one that I have two phenos of currently that I'm trying to decide which
[14:28.410 --> 14:33.050]  one to keep. Very chemmy on those sides. Those have been really fun to grow, actually.
[14:33.450 --> 14:41.290]  One that I kind of really wasn't expecting to be one of my favorites is probably kind of
[14:41.850 --> 14:45.770]  really coming to the front of the line there. That murderous precision has got some super,
[14:45.770 --> 14:53.290]  super chem turps. A little bit of like what you would call it, like Flintstones vitamins in chem
[14:53.290 --> 14:58.650]  would be like the best way I can describe that one. It's really good smoke. I got two phenos of
[14:58.650 --> 15:04.010]  the zest. One at the commercial facility is kind of like more sulfur, a little bit like stale
[15:04.010 --> 15:12.490]  orangey. It's a weird smell. It's like rotten in all the good ways. Then the one I have here is
[15:12.490 --> 15:20.810]  like straight face-off dominant. It's a pure OG. It's just nothing but gas. I'm trying to think of
[15:20.810 --> 15:26.010]  what else that I have. I still have seed of I think there's a deep line alchemy cross that
[15:26.890 --> 15:32.010]  I was planning on popping here shortly. The East Coast Orange is another one that I wanted to get
[15:32.010 --> 15:38.170]  into. I'm really excited to see some sour diesel. Hopefully that poison mimosa side will give it a
[15:38.170 --> 15:45.050]  little bit quicker of a finishing time. It really kind of sucks being tied up in the commercial side
[15:45.050 --> 15:50.490]  of things where you have rooms that have to be turned over in a certain amount of time. I wish
[15:50.490 --> 15:58.330]  we had time that we could run 12 to 14 weekers. It's just not the case when your investors need to
[15:59.050 --> 16:04.090]  see that monthly profit. We have a nine-week schedule that we're kind of handcuffed by
[16:04.090 --> 16:13.770]  on the commercial side of things. It's a blessing and a curse. I like to smoke a lot of cushions,
[16:13.770 --> 16:19.050]  so I guess that works. I would really like to get something super paranoid heady in there.
[16:19.130 --> 16:22.570]  But I don't know if we're going to have the opportunity to do that.
[16:27.560 --> 16:37.800]  Got it. Then I think we got Boston's Loudest and then Z Bud. So one of you guys want to
[16:39.240 --> 16:44.600]  introduce yourself? Sure, I'll talk. Who's that? Boston's Loudest. What's up?
[16:45.400 --> 16:49.320]  I've known Microbe for a while. We linked up a long time ago.
[16:51.720 --> 16:56.200]  Been breeding with him for a little while. Some of the stuff that I've done, I'm glad you like
[16:56.200 --> 17:03.560]  the martyr's precision. I did that. That's one of my favorites too. Right now I'm looking through
[17:03.560 --> 17:10.360]  the F3s to try to find a male for our F4 project coming up soon and also working on another male
[17:11.160 --> 17:18.200]  to eventually use. Yeah, that's all I'm doing for right now as far as running Microbe's gear.
[17:25.310 --> 17:29.150]  Got it. Sorry, my microphone keeps cutting out. No worries.
[17:32.180 --> 17:34.260]  So you guys following the chat right now?
[17:36.740 --> 17:37.620]  Spam nation.
[17:38.580 --> 17:51.460]  It's quiet. So you want to address the controversy? I'm the easygoing dude in the
[17:51.460 --> 17:55.860]  middle of whatever is going on right now. So do you want to talk about it?
[17:57.460 --> 18:04.980]  Yeah. I mean, there's just multiple facets to it. You got Eduardo and his crew over here
[18:05.940 --> 18:11.860]  talking a bunch of shit so they can get free genetics. And my old partner, who I don't work
[18:11.860 --> 18:17.220]  with anymore because I found out he was backdooring stuff, he's in here talking crap. He's the one
[18:17.220 --> 18:25.540]  that did purple tapes. The son got a couple other genetics that I sent him cuts of and seeds.
[18:25.540 --> 18:27.780]  Is that Sean P. Ferguson?
[18:27.780 --> 18:30.180]  Yep. And the idea was to...
[18:30.180 --> 18:32.340]  The name has been mentioned many times in the chat.
[18:32.340 --> 18:37.700]  Oh, yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure. Give him his 10 seconds of spotlight, whatever he needs.
[18:39.860 --> 18:44.980]  They made a YouTube last night. He was talking wild. It's just funny. I don't even care anymore.
[18:46.260 --> 18:51.300]  I'm trying to be the bigger man about it. I already offered him. If he wants to talk shit,
[18:52.660 --> 18:56.660]  talk your shit, dude. Come see me. Otherwise, I'm not even going to pay attention to it anymore.
[18:57.220 --> 18:58.980]  I'm just going to move on from it.
[18:58.980 --> 19:05.780]  Well, the shit talking is going on in the chat. So chat, I see you. We're also having a conversation
[19:05.780 --> 19:10.420]  here. I'll go back and forth. We'll keep people posted on what's going on in the chat, and we'll
[19:10.420 --> 19:21.220]  come back to the conversation. Do you want to talk about your intent as a breeder? It seems like the
[19:21.220 --> 19:30.100]  Poison Mimosa is like a North Star for you. Is that something that you put into a lot of different
[19:30.100 --> 19:35.220]  things? Yeah, that was the first one. If I'm going to make something, I want to run with it for a
[19:35.220 --> 19:41.780]  little bit. And we're going to put it on different varieties that we like, work it a little bit,
[19:41.780 --> 19:48.180]  and then move on to the next subject. But we did that first and just kind of been running with that
[19:48.180 --> 19:52.660]  for a little while. I was supposed to do a big run of it outdoors last year, but it didn't happen.
[19:53.860 --> 20:00.740]  So we found another male. We're using him. We hit it on freaking everything that I have in my stable,
[20:01.460 --> 20:07.620]  a bunch of dope gear. And then we're trying to move forward from there because that's really,
[20:07.620 --> 20:11.460]  I've been working that. We've been working that for so long. I want to put something else out
[20:11.460 --> 20:18.020]  there. Everything, it's a lot of orange in it. And Iron Lotus can talk about how he found no orange
[20:18.020 --> 20:24.420]  and all these new testers. But I want to put something else out there. We have that Deathface
[20:24.420 --> 20:30.980]  that Nate was running, the Boom Bap, me and Iron, we just put that on some his Hawaiian cat piss mail.
[20:31.940 --> 20:37.700]  A lot of cool things. But as far as just what I would like to do is just to make something that's
[20:38.260 --> 20:45.620]  more unique and not just a hodgepodge of elite gear that you got and then put together and people
[20:46.260 --> 20:50.340]  dig it for some reason. I want to put out something that is truly unique. So I like
[20:51.780 --> 20:57.140]  taking a lot of these older varieties or something that's a little strange or longer flowering,
[20:59.060 --> 21:04.100]  the Boom Bap that finishes 120 days. It could go longer probably.
[21:06.580 --> 21:09.300]  The other homie, Hemperer, was supposed to be in here, but we got
[21:10.260 --> 21:15.940]  some stock that we're looking at right now. And I think it's at week 16. It's been flowering for a
[21:15.940 --> 21:21.060]  minute, man. Now it's just finally starting to push, really set up flowers. But I'm just
[21:21.060 --> 21:26.260]  trying to put on some other varieties into newer ones, basically.
[21:28.900 --> 21:34.020]  And then in turn, you just mentioned something that takes a long time to flower. So that's
[21:34.100 --> 21:38.980]  not like a commercial market cultivar. So is that just for people who appreciate
[21:40.260 --> 21:43.540]  growing at home and don't need to rush through stuff?
[21:44.180 --> 21:51.460]  Yeah. We found a couple. Hemperer, Zach, he's been able to run some of the longer varieties,
[21:51.460 --> 21:57.540]  like the Cactus Jack, the Boom Bap, things like that. So he has the ability to run those longer
[21:57.540 --> 22:04.340]  ones. But most of them are for the real heads that want something besides a pack of cookies or
[22:04.980 --> 22:08.180]  something that's really different. And you've got to put in the time to grow it, but
[22:09.060 --> 22:14.580]  it's going to reward you unique, different terpenes, cannabinoids. It's fucking space
[22:14.580 --> 22:18.260]  weed too, man. You're high for 30 minutes smoking fucking gelato or whatever.
[22:20.020 --> 22:22.260]  It's nice, but I'd rather have variety.
[22:22.500 --> 22:26.020]  Yeah. So do you want to run through the line?
[22:27.780 --> 22:33.460]  Yeah. We can start... Since they keep talking about King Jay, I think it was 2016.
[22:33.460 --> 22:34.020]  Oh, wait.
[22:34.020 --> 22:44.820]  He sent me a pack. It was a little vial of pollen. So we put it on Boston Loudest.
[22:45.620 --> 22:53.780]  We put it on his Dervin Poison. So we did that. I went up to Maine and I was going to work up
[22:53.780 --> 23:00.020]  there for a minute, but it didn't work out. So I came home that summer and then I had 50 seeds left.
[23:00.740 --> 23:05.140]  Originally when King Jay gave me that pollen, I was just going to hit one branch,
[23:05.940 --> 23:12.500]  but my dumb ass, I forgot to turn off the fan in the back of the room. So everything got hit.
[23:12.740 --> 23:18.500]  Everything got hit. Unfortunately at the time I was working with someone who didn't
[23:18.500 --> 23:23.780]  know what they were doing and they thought they did. So their little brother, before I could get
[23:23.780 --> 23:28.820]  there, he started mixing up strains and was putting everything together. So I was only able to get
[23:28.820 --> 23:36.740]  like 100, 115 poison mimosa seeds that I knew were actually poison mimosa. So I sent Jay some,
[23:37.620 --> 23:43.940]  I think I sent him about 60 of them. I kept 60, 50 for myself, shared a couple with the homies,
[23:43.940 --> 23:50.340]  did that. That summer made the F2 and then we've just been playing with it since then,
[23:50.340 --> 23:55.540]  trying to make other varieties like the Death Face, Boom Babs, Zest, things like that.
[24:00.040 --> 24:03.240]  Some of the stuff I've queued up here, like the Blood Orange Diamond.
[24:03.640 --> 24:12.360]  Yeah, that is Bronson's cut of African Haze from Top Dog. Super piffy. I don't know,
[24:12.360 --> 24:19.240]  a lot of people don't know what piff is. It's just like that churchy incense. It smells like,
[24:19.240 --> 24:24.200]  you know, just like spices and incense and a church. I don't know. It's hard to explain.
[24:24.200 --> 24:28.280]  It's that old school haze from New York, man. Nothing like it in the world.
[24:28.920 --> 24:37.610]  Hold on, I have pictures of it. Keep talking about it while I queue this stuff up.
[24:38.490 --> 24:45.850]  So that one, it finishes, that cut is about 14, 15 weeks. So that's not really something that's
[24:45.850 --> 24:51.130]  commercially viable. So the idea was to just put the poison mimosa male on it that we have,
[24:51.130 --> 24:58.250]  which is super fast. I think we're going to trim that down to probably 11 weeks.
[24:58.330 --> 25:03.530]  There's going to be outliers that are longer and maybe some that are faster, but I'd like to keep
[25:04.170 --> 25:08.570]  that insane structure of those pure sativas. You know, I think branches like no other. It's
[25:08.570 --> 25:12.490]  the auxiliary branching. It's insane. You got to grow it. You know, you got to look at it
[25:13.530 --> 25:19.690]  and it produces these big fat spears like you see. It'll throw down in the weight category. So
[25:19.930 --> 25:25.450]  if you can have that African haze finish in 11 weeks, I think it's a winner.
[25:27.210 --> 25:35.490]  We had to snap all those necks. It was growing into the next light. It would break them all.
[25:36.530 --> 25:40.610]  It's been stretching for like four weeks, that one. Definitely a weird one.
[25:42.370 --> 25:44.210]  And then did any of these guys grow this out?
[25:44.450 --> 25:56.000]  No, Iron Lotus has the Cuban Black Haze S1, which is another like pithy haze that we did.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.040]  Maybe he could tell you about that. That one came out really interesting.
[26:01.120 --> 26:04.480]  But that one is another haze cross to a poison mimosa.
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.600]  All right. So for you guys, I'm going to go ahead and just go ahead and
[26:11.600 --> 26:18.710]  go ahead and wrap up. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up.
[26:18.710 --> 26:26.870]  All right. So for you guys, looking through those images and hearing what he's talking about,
[26:26.870 --> 26:34.090]  what are your thoughts on that? The quiet nine person panel.
[26:37.410 --> 26:42.370]  I only caught about half the images on the last one. I was waiting for them to load up. I finally
[26:42.370 --> 26:46.370]  got my phone and my internet working though. He's back.
[26:46.930 --> 26:50.930]  Yeah, I've never done a 10 person conversation.
[26:54.610 --> 26:58.450]  All right. So going from that to El Sabor.
[27:00.850 --> 27:05.410]  That's something for the new hype kids. Ice cream cake, which is, you know,
[27:06.050 --> 27:11.330]  everyone grew that this summer, I feel like, or wanted to grow it. That was a big hit.
[27:12.050 --> 27:19.730]  But I'm hoping it has some resin monsters in there. Just something for modern production.
[27:19.730 --> 27:24.850]  Because if you want to be relevant with the seeds, you got to make something
[27:25.730 --> 27:31.810]  that modern, that people want. Not everyone wants these long sativas that I'd rather be growing.
[27:32.530 --> 27:35.490]  So that's definitely one for everyone else to enjoy.
[27:38.670 --> 27:40.430]  And these are some pictures of it.
[27:41.070 --> 27:44.800]  I should have sent them right from my phone, not off Instagram.
[27:46.480 --> 27:47.040]  I agree.
[27:51.680 --> 27:55.440]  Yeah. Whenever people send me screenshots of Instagram.
[27:57.200 --> 28:01.400]  But anyway, that's...
[28:03.560 --> 28:12.000]  And this one, the Jimmy. You want to talk about the backstory on that?
[28:12.800 --> 28:17.600]  Let's do newer ones. We don't really have any data on those ones yet. But the Jimmy is
[28:18.480 --> 28:22.640]  Motor Breath with the Poison Mimosa and the Lumpa's Oranges is Lumpa's Headband
[28:23.280 --> 28:28.240]  over the Mimosa. And just trying to speed them up a little bit, put a bigger frame on it.
[28:29.360 --> 28:32.320]  But yeah, those ones we don't have a lot of data on.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.640]  That was made this summer in the Hugels outside. Some of the biggest seeds I've ever seen in my
[28:40.640 --> 28:47.450]  life though, under the sun. So you're growing in Hugel beds?
[28:48.650 --> 28:56.330]  Yeah, this is the first one I did. A couple of years ago, one of the homies on Instagram
[28:56.890 --> 29:01.370]  said just not to mess around with putting them in big pots. And I was like, I wasn't trying to hear
[29:01.370 --> 29:06.810]  it. They're going to get root bound, blah, blah, blah. So I listened to them and I just planted
[29:06.810 --> 29:11.290]  it right in the ground and that was it. I'm not doing no more pots. Maybe there'll be a couple
[29:11.290 --> 29:16.890]  fabric raised pots or something like that. But I barely have to water, just put them right in the
[29:16.890 --> 29:26.010]  ground. Happy, it's healthiest plants I ever had in my life. So Chad in the chat said, do you like
[29:26.010 --> 29:33.930]  line breeding, back crossing? What generation do you like to take things to? Well, something we
[29:33.930 --> 29:38.890]  found that was really cool when we started working with the Poison Mimosa, it came out in the F2,
[29:39.450 --> 29:46.890]  but was the crazy exaggerated serrations. And it has a real narrow leaf and super serrated. A
[29:46.890 --> 29:53.130]  couple of people have had them. But right now we're trying to lock that in, whether we have to
[29:53.850 --> 29:59.930]  go to F4, the two serrated ones, and then back cross it. Or if we have to back cross it with
[29:59.930 --> 30:05.050]  the one that we have. But we're trying to find two new parents out of the F3 stock right now.
[30:06.010 --> 30:09.330]  Got it.
[30:09.330 --> 30:15.730]  But I mean, otherwise, I mean, there's like we just did, I did a Swazi Gold open pollination
[30:16.610 --> 30:23.890]  outside this summer. And that wasn't the only selecting that I did was removing any fucky
[30:23.890 --> 30:29.090]  herms or anything like that. Otherwise, it was just, I took a bunch of different stock. I got
[30:29.090 --> 30:36.130]  some Heart Rock, World of Seeds, a couple other ones that Wonder made me do it, shared with me.
[30:36.130 --> 30:42.370]  So we were collecting a couple of nice varieties and then we did that. So an open pollination,
[30:42.370 --> 30:47.570]  if you're trying to preserve something like eggs or you want to keep a line wide open,
[30:47.570 --> 30:49.250]  that's always another route you can go to.
[30:54.750 --> 30:58.030]  Sorry, I'm also dealing with a very uppity chat.
[31:01.950 --> 31:02.510]  What's up, guys?
[31:02.590 --> 31:11.790]  So, all right. Where are you calling in from? You look like you're in a long hallway.
[31:13.870 --> 31:21.070]  Yeah, I literally, well, I wasn't in it for a minute. But I wish I came to get something to eat.
[31:22.510 --> 31:25.230]  But I'm stepping out for a second to get on this chat real quick.
[31:27.310 --> 31:28.430]  And what state are you in?
[31:29.310 --> 31:30.030]  I'm in Maine.
[31:30.670 --> 31:39.070]  Ah, okay. Oh, wow. Damn. Yes, you are. I'm in LA and it's warm and sunny.
[31:39.710 --> 31:44.590]  I'm from Miami originally. So, you know, a little out of my habitat.
[31:45.230 --> 31:45.550]  Right.
[31:47.230 --> 31:55.160]  It's all good, though. Yeah, so I'm popping some of this Ziggy that I got and that shit's just
[31:55.160 --> 31:56.680]  growing like a psychopath.
[31:57.320 --> 32:02.490]  Star dog poison mimosa, Corey Hamecut.
[32:03.290 --> 32:09.690]  Yeah, that shit's going wild. I mean, I wish I was home. But I totally honestly,
[32:09.690 --> 32:14.810]  I've been like all day going in and out. And I haven't even eaten all day.
[32:16.810 --> 32:22.890]  So I just came to eat something. But the poison mimosa, I think I got the F2 from Boston Loudest,
[32:22.890 --> 32:23.130]  right?
[32:23.130 --> 32:23.690]  F1. F1.
[32:25.210 --> 32:26.250]  Yeah, so.
[32:26.330 --> 32:31.130]  That F1 that I got is out of hand. I mean, it's crazy. It's like one of the most vigorous
[32:31.690 --> 32:37.770]  plants I've ever grown. And like the leaves are basically the size of my face.
[32:39.850 --> 32:41.210]  I don't know if I'm frozen or not.
[32:41.770 --> 32:51.430]  No, no, no. You actually have great reset compared to 50% of the people in this conversation.
[32:51.430 --> 32:54.870]  You're excelling in the bandwidth.
[32:55.430 --> 33:01.350]  Awesome. Perfect. Yeah, no. So I mean, growing that the first round, it was like she was kind
[33:01.350 --> 33:08.470]  of strange in the sense of like the buds were just not. They were all the same size from top
[33:08.470 --> 33:14.550]  to bottom. And then I was like, OK, well, let me give her a chance all year long because, you know,
[33:15.910 --> 33:20.630]  summer versus winter, even though it's indoor, there's still, you know, it's still a lot of
[33:20.950 --> 33:25.430]  summer versus winter, even though it's indoor, there's still, you know, it's still you still
[33:25.430 --> 33:30.950]  get affected, you know, the amount of humidity that's trying to go up and down.
[33:30.950 --> 33:34.150]  Your machines are working. You know, it's just it's always different.
[33:35.750 --> 33:42.070]  So then I ran her into the summer and she was just like insane. So I put her outside
[33:42.070 --> 33:44.790]  and I have pictures that she's like 17 feet tall.
[33:45.350 --> 33:54.390]  And I think I got like five pounds off of that one plant. And I mean, I haven't ran her into
[33:54.390 --> 34:01.190]  rosin, but I'm very interested in in doing that because when I do run her into concentrates,
[34:01.750 --> 34:10.790]  I turn her into diamonds mostly because she has so much THCA in her that I get boulders like
[34:11.350 --> 34:19.590]  in a month. It's crazy. And the smell that it gives, I mean, it's just everyone knows what it
[34:19.590 --> 34:24.710]  is already, you know? Yeah, I think you had a hit on your hands up there.
[34:26.070 --> 34:31.590]  Yeah, no, I mean, I don't know what he made or did or what I got from Boston Loudest,
[34:31.590 --> 34:38.790]  but Lord, baby Jesus, he popped that right seed. Let me tell you, because I honestly I don't know
[34:39.350 --> 34:47.190]  what he did. And then I think I gave my globe gelato 33 Larry Bird plant or Boston Loudest.
[34:47.910 --> 34:52.150]  And I think they crossed it with what did you guys cross it with?
[34:53.110 --> 34:53.750]  Face off.
[34:56.630 --> 34:58.070]  That's Patty has it right now.
[34:59.350 --> 35:01.750]  So how's that? Because I haven't popped that yet.
[35:02.310 --> 35:02.870]  Wanna cut?
[35:03.110 --> 35:06.230]  Yeah, I'm ready to cut.
[35:06.230 --> 35:09.270]  Everything I've ran with the face off genetics has been good.
[35:11.430 --> 35:12.470]  Yeah, this mean mug is.
[35:13.430 --> 35:18.230]  I mean, I love face off, though. I've got a very a lot of experience with that line.
[35:19.190 --> 35:25.110]  Yeah, that Mary Bird cut is like a real real the real deal cut. So I thought I was like,
[35:25.110 --> 35:27.590]  yo, I can't imagine what's gonna happen.
[35:27.910 --> 35:30.790]  Yeah, he found a really nice one and he got it back to us.
[35:31.350 --> 35:36.870]  And I think we're to double down with the face off. And I have the winner circle, which is
[35:36.870 --> 35:43.670]  the camp for face off that I made at my buddy's house. We're going to put that on it. See what
[35:43.670 --> 35:48.950]  happens. But, you know, I want to make like the whole idea is to make like a really nice palette
[35:49.510 --> 35:55.990]  flavors to choose from, you know, that way when, you know, blueberries hot again next year.
[35:56.150 --> 36:00.630]  Blueberries hot again next year, whatever it is, I can just say, all right, here,
[36:00.630 --> 36:07.190]  you know, we got this mail. Let's fucking get it done. Yeah. Yeah, man, that one's gonna be
[36:07.190 --> 36:12.470]  special. You got to get a cut from Boston's loudest of that one. Definitely, definitely,
[36:12.470 --> 36:18.150]  definitely. 100%. Yeah, I have some seeds of that. I actually had your purple tapes in a room
[36:18.790 --> 36:25.030]  and I left for a week and my the person who was watching it didn't notice that it was a male.
[36:25.670 --> 36:32.150]  And it pollinated my basically my whole room, but a lot, a lot didn't catch, but I had a GMO
[36:32.790 --> 36:38.390]  faster flex, but they got pollinated by the purple turf purple tapes.
[36:40.070 --> 36:46.470]  So I have no idea what the fuck is going to come from that, but I just popped a bunch of seeds and
[36:47.590 --> 36:51.270]  I don't know if I find anything crazy, I'm definitely going to send some cuts or some
[36:51.830 --> 37:00.550]  whatever over. Yeah, share it with everyone. Definitely. This definitely, it was an accident,
[37:00.550 --> 37:05.910]  but holy shit. Violetta, right? Times chem four. Oh, happy little accidents. Like,
[37:05.910 --> 37:11.910]  uh, what's his name? The painter, dude. I don't know, but that's what purple tapes is, right?
[37:12.630 --> 37:18.550]  It's a chem chem for Violetta. Yeah, I think there's a
[37:21.030 --> 37:26.550]  purple Malawi across the PCK. That's crazy. That's one that he had for a minute and I was like,
[37:26.550 --> 37:30.470]  all right, so I'll send you a bunch of poison mimosas seeds and then let's,
[37:31.030 --> 37:35.350]  you know, make a bunch of seeds with it. And now, now you did make a winner with that one.
[37:35.910 --> 37:39.190]  Holy shit. Yeah. That's going to be crazy.
[37:42.150 --> 37:51.190]  I also collected some of that powder, that, uh, pollen from the, that, the something roulette,
[37:51.190 --> 37:59.110]  uh, smugglers roulette or something. I 95 Malawi Panama. Yeah. I got a mail and
[38:00.150 --> 38:03.590]  so I kept some of this pollen and I don't know really what to do with it, but
[38:05.350 --> 38:10.630]  I put it on sun. Yeah, for sure. Definitely. I can't, I want to put it to some wedding cake
[38:10.630 --> 38:17.350]  that I got from seed junkie. So speaking of seed junkie, we just put that menage a pollen on a
[38:17.350 --> 38:23.590]  bunch of original Hayes. That's going to be wild. I'll get you some seeds. I get everyone some seeds.
[38:23.590 --> 38:30.390]  That one's going to be a banger. Oh yeah. I don't know, but I'll never take down that
[38:30.390 --> 38:32.230]  poison from my lineup. That's just insane.
[38:35.430 --> 38:41.190]  But do you like it? It's so easy to grow. I mean, in my opinion, she's super resistant,
[38:41.190 --> 38:48.230]  resilient to, to really anything. Um, outdoor, she did amazing. I had no issues.
[38:51.910 --> 38:56.150]  I mean, the ones that we've been doing, I think the most of them have been made outside. I mean,
[38:56.150 --> 39:00.230]  I don't know how long it takes for something to actually acclimate, but I mean, I don't think it
[39:00.230 --> 39:04.950]  goes through generations either. Maybe it does. I don't really know. But, um, I'd like to make
[39:04.950 --> 39:09.110]  something for the new England growers, like something that's going to finish in Maine.
[39:09.670 --> 39:15.270]  That has power, you know, so you guys can finish it without having to debt anything.
[39:15.270 --> 39:18.870]  That's like the opposite of the 120 day one you were talking about, right?
[39:18.870 --> 39:23.750]  I know, but the pallet Pete, I got a couple of things, got a couple of things we're working on.
[39:24.310 --> 39:29.670]  Definitely. I mean, I'm all over the place. We're all over the place.
[39:31.350 --> 39:36.790]  I mean, it's good. You want to be reaching out to all markets, you know, definitely.
[39:38.310 --> 39:43.030]  And maybe if you don't, and I mean, I think you're kind of known to be a land race,
[39:43.030 --> 39:47.670]  the Tiva kind of guy. I think that's like what you're really well known for.
[39:48.390 --> 39:54.470]  Um, sorry, go ahead. Yeah. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think that's
[39:54.470 --> 40:00.950]  great. You have your niche and if people understand how crazy it is to get a Durban poison and
[40:01.590 --> 40:07.670]  to get them, I mean, that's, you know, and all those black hazes that you have, those are rare,
[40:08.390 --> 40:13.510]  rare strains and they're hard to find and to cross them now to all these weird,
[40:13.510 --> 40:18.150]  crazy cuts that everyone's getting is just like, not many people have the balls to do it.
[40:19.670 --> 40:24.470]  Yeah. I just want to, I'd like for us all to do something different. It's easy to take,
[40:25.110 --> 40:31.430]  you know, someone's hard work that blew up. Like it's easy to take a cut of Harry's
[40:31.430 --> 40:36.150]  trap cookies, his fucking breeder cut and put anything on it. That's fucking easy.
[40:36.790 --> 40:40.630]  Run through some weird shit and find something that's truly a banger.
[40:41.190 --> 40:46.470]  Oh yeah. Something that takes a long time or something like that. Like the sativa because
[40:46.470 --> 40:51.030]  the other, I have patients with those three months to like two and a half months. That's
[40:51.030 --> 40:54.550]  a long time to be flowering something out. And some people just want something that's
[40:54.550 --> 40:57.430]  going to flower and what, like seven to eight weeks, maybe in a second.
[40:57.430 --> 41:02.550]  Yeah man. No patience. I can understand, man. I mean, I don't want to wait.
[41:02.550 --> 41:06.470]  You just want something that's long and you just want something that just pop in and out and
[41:06.470 --> 41:10.790]  stuff like that. So, you know what I mean? It's just, it's just, you have patience. So,
[41:10.790 --> 41:14.230]  and if you have patience, you have the room for it, you're going to want to grow that plant out,
[41:14.230 --> 41:19.350]  even if it takes you like, you know, three to four months, whatever it is and stuff like that. So
[41:19.350 --> 41:24.870]  it's just dependent on the growing yourself. Yeah, man. Some of those, you know, those
[41:24.870 --> 41:28.550]  genetics, they're going to reward you because there's a lot of weird shit to be found in there.
[41:29.270 --> 41:30.470]  Not yet. Most definitely.
[41:30.630 --> 41:40.540]  Okay. So by the way, Larry, are you in like your grow closet with the reflective panels and like
[41:40.540 --> 41:43.260]  LED lights above you? That's my grow room.
[41:43.260 --> 41:44.060]  What's that?
[41:44.060 --> 41:45.820]  That's my grow room.
[41:45.820 --> 41:46.380]  Sex dungeon.
[41:46.380 --> 41:50.780]  You're going to come out with a tan.
[41:50.780 --> 41:57.660]  Dude, I already have a tan. Like I'm always out there blowing in this Cali sun,
[41:58.620 --> 42:03.980]  that shit. And especially like in SoCal, like San Diego or the opposite, like human side area
[42:03.980 --> 42:08.300]  or Arizona side area, like sun's just beaming over here, dude. There's no shade anywhere.
[42:09.500 --> 42:15.100]  And yeah, I'm already dark as can be. So especially with this next light mega.
[42:16.700 --> 42:18.220]  Yeah. Right. Those things rip, dude.
[42:18.780 --> 42:19.580]  Yeah. And it's
[42:19.580 --> 42:20.540]  Bright as hell.
[42:21.260 --> 42:25.020]  Dude, I'm going to need some glasses because eventually I'm going to fucking go blind.
[42:25.500 --> 42:35.440]  So let's and Brandon is going to come on, but we may need to.
[42:35.440 --> 42:39.360]  No, Zbud was trying to get back on. He got dropped every 10 minutes, he said.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.520]  Yeah, no, Zbud's still on. Zbud, can you hear me?
[42:45.040 --> 42:45.520]  Yeah, I got you.
[42:45.520 --> 42:53.120]  Zbud. Okay. Because I think we can max out at 10 people total and Brandon wanted to jump on
[42:54.080 --> 42:58.160]  for a minute. So can someone jump off for a couple minutes and Brandon will...
[43:01.470 --> 43:05.230]  Oh, there we go. All right. So Brandon, if you're listening, jump on.
[43:06.990 --> 43:09.070]  And we have other people who want to jump on too.
[43:10.510 --> 43:11.550]  I'm sure we will.
[43:12.350 --> 43:20.350]  So let's... Oh, sorry. So the Mandarin sunshine, we haven't hit that yet, right?
[43:21.150 --> 43:23.390]  Yeah. Let Zbud talk about that. That's his baby.
[43:24.590 --> 43:26.510]  I think Z... Oh, there's Brandon. Hold on.
[43:29.150 --> 43:32.510]  So actually... All right. So before... Here, Brandon, what's up?
[43:33.070 --> 43:34.590]  What's going on, guys? Can you hear me all right?
[43:35.150 --> 43:36.670]  Look at you. You look pro.
[43:40.590 --> 43:41.470]  Look at that.
[43:41.470 --> 43:44.750]  Hey, Brandon. Nice to finally meet you, bro. It's been a while.
[43:44.750 --> 43:49.550]  I know we've been talking back and forth on IG, but nice to finally meet you, my man.
[43:53.240 --> 43:55.960]  So Brandon, turn up your audio a little bit.
[43:57.400 --> 44:00.200]  On the mixing board that you must have in front of you.
[44:00.200 --> 44:02.840]  I do have a mixing board. Let's see.
[44:02.840 --> 44:03.560]  Now that you're pro.
[44:04.760 --> 44:05.720]  Professional.
[44:06.920 --> 44:07.720]  Is that better now?
[44:08.360 --> 44:09.160]  Keep going up.
[44:09.800 --> 44:10.360]  How about now?
[44:10.920 --> 44:11.560]  Keep going up.
[44:11.560 --> 44:12.280]  How about now?
[44:14.440 --> 44:15.720]  Say, can you hear me now?
[44:15.720 --> 44:16.520]  Can you hear me now?
[44:18.040 --> 44:22.040]  I think... So are you running like a USB cable into the laptop?
[44:23.080 --> 44:25.080]  Yeah, but I also have everything hooked up to a...
[44:25.160 --> 44:27.960]  Oh, wait. It just started sounding better.
[44:27.960 --> 44:29.640]  Okay. I turned the gain up.
[44:29.640 --> 44:32.520]  Yeah, there we go. That's what I was trying to tell you to do. But all right.
[44:33.880 --> 44:36.200]  So what's up? What do you have to say?
[44:36.200 --> 44:39.880]  Because I told you it's going to be a contentious episode, right?
[44:39.880 --> 44:46.920]  Oh, yeah. I know. Micra breached out early and asked if I wanted to jump on the show.
[44:46.920 --> 44:50.440]  You know, I think the whole issue between the two was...
[44:51.400 --> 44:54.120]  It was more of a marketing thing to begin with.
[44:54.120 --> 44:56.760]  And then I think it got blown out of proportion.
[44:58.360 --> 45:01.960]  And then people's followers like come at people wrong and shit.
[45:01.960 --> 45:03.720]  And it just escalates from there.
[45:03.720 --> 45:06.360]  And then people get pissed off because it fucks with their money.
[45:06.360 --> 45:09.320]  And people are going back and forth and shit.
[45:10.600 --> 45:12.680]  So, you know, and I know Sean P.
[45:12.680 --> 45:14.200]  I work with both Microbe stuff.
[45:14.200 --> 45:15.400]  I work with Sean stuff.
[45:16.600 --> 45:18.520]  And I don't get involved in the drama.
[45:18.840 --> 45:23.960]  Whatever type of shit you got going on with someone.
[45:23.960 --> 45:27.480]  And if that shit's personal, handle your fucking business, dude.
[45:27.480 --> 45:30.760]  You don't need to fucking air that shit out like dirty laundry and shit.
[45:30.760 --> 45:31.880]  You know what I mean?
[45:31.880 --> 45:34.760]  It fucks with people's money, fucks with people's livelihood.
[45:34.760 --> 45:37.640]  And I'm not with that shit.
[45:37.640 --> 45:38.360]  You know what I mean?
[45:38.360 --> 45:42.280]  I support Masonic. I support Microbe. I support Sean.
[45:42.280 --> 45:43.960]  I mean, everybody can work in the community.
[45:43.960 --> 45:44.520]  But if you got...
[45:45.400 --> 45:47.800]  There's a lot of motherfucking shit talk over the internet.
[45:48.520 --> 45:49.480]  You know what I mean?
[45:49.480 --> 45:52.760]  And that's like, I don't fucking talk shit over the internet.
[45:52.760 --> 45:54.280]  If I got fucking beef, I'll fucking...
[45:54.920 --> 45:55.800]  I'll glove up.
[45:55.800 --> 45:56.520]  You know what I mean?
[45:56.520 --> 45:57.480]  I'll throw down.
[45:57.480 --> 45:58.680]  But that's how...
[45:58.680 --> 46:01.000]  That's what the school that I was raised in, you know?
[46:01.000 --> 46:02.760]  I've been to fucking prison twice and shit.
[46:02.760 --> 46:06.520]  So even if you get your ass kicked, at least you fucking stood up for yourself.
[46:06.520 --> 46:09.400]  And you showed everybody else like I was about that shit.
[46:14.220 --> 46:14.780]  Well said.
[46:15.740 --> 46:19.580]  I'm mostly just in awe of your new AV setup.
[46:21.340 --> 46:24.060]  Which I'm very excited about for future shows.
[46:24.700 --> 46:26.620]  Yeah, I'm gonna get a microphone.
[46:26.620 --> 46:29.580]  I have this like back to studio backdrop now.
[46:29.580 --> 46:34.700]  I bet everybody's wondering how I'm able to do all these things all at once all the time.
[46:34.700 --> 46:35.900]  It's because I don't sleep, guys.
[46:38.380 --> 46:38.860]  Right.
[46:39.500 --> 46:40.540]  Now it's...
[46:40.860 --> 46:41.340]  Now it's...
[46:42.940 --> 46:48.300]  I mean, in terms of industry shit talking, it drives me crazy.
[46:48.300 --> 46:51.500]  It's like, I've never seen a world where...
[46:51.500 --> 46:54.220]  It's like people smoke weed and they should be chill.
[46:54.220 --> 46:56.140]  And then everyone talks shit about each other.
[46:58.780 --> 47:05.340]  And like people who agree on 98% of things and they like disagree on 2%,
[47:06.540 --> 47:08.460]  you know, suddenly hate each other.
[47:08.460 --> 47:14.380]  And I mean, for me, it's kind of like big ag and big cannabis or like
[47:14.380 --> 47:17.020]  lapping everybody who's squabbling with each other.
[47:20.060 --> 47:23.420]  But anyway, those are my two cents.
[47:24.540 --> 47:26.780]  Yeah, no, I mean, it gets old after a while.
[47:26.780 --> 47:28.140]  It's fucking tiring.
[47:28.780 --> 47:30.380]  It's like, dude, I'm a dad.
[47:30.380 --> 47:31.740]  I got a job.
[47:31.740 --> 47:33.260]  I got multiple gardens.
[47:33.260 --> 47:34.540]  I don't give a fuck about you.
[47:35.500 --> 47:41.340]  You know, like Russ said, if you want to fucking put some gloves on, you can do that.
[47:41.340 --> 47:44.220]  Otherwise, make your memes, whatever.
[47:44.220 --> 47:45.180]  I don't give a fuck.
[47:45.180 --> 47:46.300]  I'm just gonna do what I'm doing.
[47:47.020 --> 47:51.420]  And just FYI, you know, that option is available out here in Oklahoma.
[47:51.420 --> 47:55.340]  They have a cannabis grudge match, which is full on boxing ring.
[47:55.340 --> 47:56.380]  You can literally...
[47:56.380 --> 47:57.500]  Hey, you can glove up.
[47:57.500 --> 47:58.300]  No joke, dude.
[47:58.300 --> 47:59.180]  I went.
[47:59.180 --> 47:59.820]  I went.
[47:59.820 --> 48:01.420]  It's a smoking event.
[48:01.420 --> 48:06.700]  Like Nate Robinson and who is the YouTube guy who KO'd him?
[48:11.580 --> 48:12.700]  That was epic.
[48:12.700 --> 48:13.820]  Yeah, we're gonna have to do that event.
[48:23.980 --> 48:27.580]  We're gonna have Iron Lotus talk about that fucking cheeseburger shit, though.
[48:27.660 --> 48:28.780]  Cheeseburger shit, though.
[48:30.940 --> 48:33.420]  We may have lost Iron Lotus.
[48:34.700 --> 48:35.500]  Did we do that?
[48:35.500 --> 48:36.700]  Did we start talking about...
[48:36.700 --> 48:37.500]  Is Z-Bud here?
[48:39.260 --> 48:45.100]  Yeah, I think somebody's background YouTube volume is up and it's coming back in the reverb.
[48:48.300 --> 48:49.340]  That may have been Nate.
[48:50.780 --> 48:52.060]  Because I just muted you.
[48:53.020 --> 48:56.220]  Nate, you are the culprit.
[48:56.220 --> 48:57.020]  I just muted you.
[48:58.460 --> 49:01.340]  We're gonna keep you muted for a second.
[49:02.700 --> 49:08.860]  I think Z wanted to talk about the Mandarin and the powwow and the crazy fucking serrations
[49:08.860 --> 49:10.780]  that the Poison Mimosa passed on.
[49:10.780 --> 49:14.380]  Okay, yeah, let's start with Mandarin because I actually have pictures of that ready to go
[49:14.380 --> 49:14.940]  and queued up.
[49:17.500 --> 49:21.340]  So Z-Bud, you got to unmute yourself.
[49:24.140 --> 49:25.180]  I hope you can hear me.
[49:26.780 --> 49:27.420]  We can hear you.
[49:27.660 --> 49:28.940]  My hand's all choppy.
[49:28.940 --> 49:30.060]  I can't get it sorted.
[49:34.300 --> 49:35.820]  I know, that's actually pretty choppy.
[49:37.740 --> 49:38.300]  Can you hear me?
[49:39.180 --> 49:39.660]  Hold on.
[49:40.620 --> 49:42.300]  Uh, sort of.
[49:45.500 --> 49:46.140]  Not so much.
[49:46.140 --> 49:51.900]  ... purple tapes cross to Poison Mimosa to my Z-cut.
[49:51.900 --> 49:53.100]  It's a really nice cut.
[49:53.900 --> 49:54.700]  Awesome job.
[49:58.300 --> 50:05.420]  Um, and then when I pumped those seeds, I found that super freak serrated, you know,
[50:05.420 --> 50:06.540]  and that was the start of...
[50:09.980 --> 50:16.940]  Why don't we just, because you keep cutting out, uh, Microbe, you want to take over the
[50:16.940 --> 50:20.700]  descriptive, the narration, the storytelling.
[50:21.660 --> 50:28.860]  Um, that is his Z-Bud cut is, um, F2 Poison Mimosa stock that he found.
[50:29.980 --> 50:32.460]  And, um, can you hear him in the background?
[50:33.340 --> 50:33.660]  Yeah.
[50:34.620 --> 50:36.780]  Mike, take it down a notch, bub.
[50:37.580 --> 50:40.540]  Um, yeah, daddy duty.
[50:41.100 --> 50:42.700]  Yeah, I feel you.
[50:42.700 --> 50:44.780]  So we're talking Mandarin Sunshine right now?
[50:45.020 --> 50:45.500]  Yes.
[50:45.500 --> 50:50.060]  So that's his Z-Bud cross to a purple tapes male that he found.
[50:50.780 --> 50:54.940]  And, um, a lot of them are finishing really fast.
[50:54.940 --> 51:03.660]  They're finishing in about, you know, early eight weeks, nine weeks, um, average mold
[51:03.660 --> 51:08.620]  resistance, but it's something that is being bred and worked outside in New England.
[51:08.620 --> 51:11.980]  So we're hoping to work on that because it does finish fast.
[51:11.980 --> 51:14.860]  Everything, the Poison Mimosa touches, it finishes much faster.
[51:15.660 --> 51:19.420]  So, you know, it's quick.
[51:20.380 --> 51:23.820]  Some of the progeny has that awesome serration you can see right there.
[51:24.140 --> 51:32.060]  I think it's like one in 41 and 50 that is popping up, but it's something that we're
[51:32.060 --> 51:32.860]  trying to lock in.
[51:32.860 --> 51:34.300]  We have a male like that.
[51:34.860 --> 51:35.820]  It's ready to go.
[51:35.820 --> 51:37.820]  I think he already made the F2.
[51:37.820 --> 51:40.220]  We're just trying to wait until all these F1 are gone.
[51:40.300 --> 51:45.980]  But, um, you know, we're going to put it on some other elites that we have some GMO, some
[51:45.980 --> 51:52.540]  other things, um, screwdriver, murderous precision, a couple other things.
[51:52.540 --> 51:56.620]  Um, he's got a lot of awesome Bodie stock that I know.
[51:57.500 --> 51:59.580]  So, I mean, the options are endless.
[51:59.580 --> 52:03.820]  Dude, he kills it in the garden, always pop an interesting seed.
[52:03.820 --> 52:05.820]  So look at that.
[52:05.820 --> 52:07.420]  That's what we're trying to lock in right there.
[52:07.660 --> 52:08.160]  Unique.
[52:09.180 --> 52:12.940]  And then I don't know if you're aware of the, uh, that freak show, Strain Pete.
[52:12.940 --> 52:14.940]  I am.
[52:14.940 --> 52:17.180]  I am very aware of it.
[52:18.060 --> 52:19.100]  I've been talking with him.
[52:19.100 --> 52:20.380]  I have some right here.
[52:20.380 --> 52:21.020]  You've been talking.
[52:21.020 --> 52:22.700]  Well, who have you been talking to?
[52:22.700 --> 52:24.380]  Jordan, the father?
[52:24.380 --> 52:25.900]  I'm so bad with names, man.
[52:25.900 --> 52:26.540]  I just go.
[52:26.540 --> 52:27.660]  I think it's the son.
[52:28.460 --> 52:29.020]  Okay.
[52:29.020 --> 52:29.500]  Yeah.
[52:29.500 --> 52:30.060]  Don't don't.
[52:30.060 --> 52:31.260]  I'm going to be blunt.
[52:31.260 --> 52:33.020]  Talk to the father, not the son.
[52:33.020 --> 52:33.500]  Yeah.
[52:33.500 --> 52:36.220]  I would talk to someone, but I don't know.
[52:36.220 --> 52:40.380]  I would talk to someone, but I've had a couple offers and I don't know if they want us to
[52:40.380 --> 52:43.420]  put that on it or the poison mimosa, but that would be cool.
[52:43.420 --> 52:44.220]  See what comes out.
[52:48.480 --> 52:50.080]  Definitely interesting looking.
[52:50.080 --> 52:56.720]  And these have popped up in the F2 poison mimosa stock a lot more because a lot more
[52:56.720 --> 52:57.280]  people have popped.
[52:57.280 --> 52:58.320]  Those is a little older.
[53:00.160 --> 53:06.640]  Also, the new line that we just dropped all the F2 progeny showing the crazy serrations,
[53:06.960 --> 53:10.800]  not to this extent, but I have a feeling they're in there.
[53:13.900 --> 53:16.940]  And so what's the process of locking in a trait like that?
[53:18.300 --> 53:26.380]  Well, he has a male and a female F1, so he made the F2 and then we're going to hunt the F2,
[53:27.180 --> 53:29.020]  do as big of a sift as possible.
[53:29.740 --> 53:35.100]  And, you know, hopefully there's something in the F2 and then you could line work it that way
[53:35.580 --> 53:38.300]  and then lock in the serration with the F3.
[53:38.300 --> 53:40.300]  You can always back cross too.
[53:40.300 --> 53:44.140]  You know, you can go back to the original male multiple times and that'll do it eventually.
[53:44.140 --> 53:46.140]  But I mean, whatever it is, it's going to take some time.
[53:47.020 --> 53:52.880]  All right.
[53:52.880 --> 53:56.080]  We're almost through my slow.
[53:56.080 --> 53:56.960]  Yeah, there's a lot of that.
[54:03.680 --> 54:04.400]  Yeah, there's the.
[54:05.760 --> 54:06.480]  That's the male.
[54:06.480 --> 54:07.280]  Leaf structure.
[54:08.320 --> 54:09.680]  Yeah, all those serrated ones.
[54:09.680 --> 54:10.880]  That's the male that was used.
[54:11.760 --> 54:14.100]  All right.
[54:14.100 --> 54:15.540]  I think I got through the.
[54:17.460 --> 54:18.180]  The slideshow.
[54:23.060 --> 54:24.580]  And I think we lost.
[54:27.700 --> 54:28.580]  Who was it?
[54:28.580 --> 54:30.100]  Whose audio was choppy?
[54:30.980 --> 54:32.980]  Was that Zeebud or Pat?
[54:34.820 --> 54:35.460]  What was?
[54:35.460 --> 54:38.100]  Yeah, it may have been Pat or Boston Loudest.
[54:40.420 --> 54:41.460]  All three of them had dropped.
[54:43.300 --> 54:47.300]  But anyway, going on the orange.
[54:47.300 --> 54:50.500]  Yeah, he said it's all fucked up on his end.
[54:51.220 --> 54:53.780]  That's a new one that I made in the Hugo this year also.
[54:54.980 --> 55:00.900]  But yeah, that one we don't have a lot of data on that was made with the Jimmy and the Lumpas.
[55:00.900 --> 55:01.700]  That's a new one.
[55:04.180 --> 55:05.460]  So that one we don't really have.
[55:05.460 --> 55:05.860]  Hold on.
[55:05.860 --> 55:06.180]  Let me.
[55:06.900 --> 55:07.940]  I don't have anything.
[55:07.940 --> 55:08.340]  All right.
[55:08.340 --> 55:11.700]  So then the next one, I have many photos.
[55:12.740 --> 55:13.700]  Can all bear with me.
[55:15.700 --> 55:20.260]  And chat, don't think I haven't forgotten about you and all the positive energy you're bringing.
[55:21.220 --> 55:21.540]  Yeah.
[55:24.340 --> 55:24.660]  All right.
[55:24.660 --> 55:29.220]  So so talk poison mimosa while I cue this up.
[55:31.140 --> 55:34.900]  Yeah, the F3, that's just something we're just trying to continue to work with it,
[55:34.900 --> 55:36.500]  because like you said, that's kind of like the.
[55:37.780 --> 55:41.380]  North Star, so rebel, that's the first one that we really
[55:41.940 --> 55:43.300]  had any luck with.
[55:43.300 --> 55:45.860]  So we're going to continue to work with that.
[55:45.860 --> 55:49.620]  We're working on the F4 right now, like I said, trying to find that serrated male.
[55:52.500 --> 55:54.580]  That's F2 stock right there.
[55:54.580 --> 55:55.940]  Forget who's bro is that?
[55:55.940 --> 55:58.740]  Or that might be the green alchemist.
[56:00.180 --> 56:00.980]  Might have been hers.
[56:02.660 --> 56:03.140]  Forget.
[56:07.580 --> 56:12.380]  But yeah, I mean, you're going to see anything from heavy orange,
[56:12.380 --> 56:17.660]  like sweet oranges, candied oranges to, you know, very similar to Tangy.
[56:18.220 --> 56:24.300]  You'll have the Clementine, even the bitter, like the.
[56:25.500 --> 56:32.700]  Rind, I guess it would be like a rind smell, but all that and then you throw the Durban into the
[56:32.700 --> 56:37.100]  mix and it just it's put this weird rubber shoe smell on everything.
[56:37.100 --> 56:41.260]  It's really hard to explain, but it just smells like a new shoe store to me.
[56:43.340 --> 56:45.340]  But yeah, oranges and new shoes.
[56:46.860 --> 56:49.500]  Brandon, do you have any thoughts on what you're seeing?
[56:51.660 --> 56:52.380]  Is that the poison?
[56:52.380 --> 56:52.700]  The most?
[56:52.700 --> 56:57.660]  Yeah, I think that's F1 stock that shed grower, shed grower grew.
[57:00.380 --> 57:04.220]  Yeah, I ran a bunch of different females of the F2.
[57:04.220 --> 57:06.700]  Yeah, I think I gave you a good amount of them and you ran through a bunch.
[57:07.340 --> 57:07.980]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[57:07.980 --> 57:08.540]  I don't remember.
[57:09.180 --> 57:11.100]  But I did.
[57:12.060 --> 57:16.540]  That's when I like had you sent me seeds, I think, when I first found out about Instagram,
[57:16.540 --> 57:19.900]  like at the end of 2018 or something like that.
[57:20.860 --> 57:27.660]  And I in 2019, I started running them and I, you know, they were pretty consistent
[57:27.660 --> 57:31.340]  across the board as far as the turpin profile, which I got mostly.
[57:33.660 --> 57:40.220]  Like, almost like a really like a sweet, deep sandalwood with.
[57:41.980 --> 57:48.940]  Kind of like a sweet citrus, not like a typical like lime pining type citrus, but more of maybe
[57:48.940 --> 57:54.460]  like a like a sweet berry citrus, if that kind of makes sense.
[57:54.460 --> 57:55.900]  That's what I got in mind.
[57:56.460 --> 58:00.380]  And then I had one particular Fino, which was an outlier.
[58:00.380 --> 58:03.260]  It was it finished in 49 days.
[58:03.260 --> 58:06.220]  It was super fast and I unfortunately lost it.
[58:06.220 --> 58:10.780]  And the reason why is because I'm really meticulous about like plants that I choose to run.
[58:10.780 --> 58:14.140]  And that thing just like it didn't matter how I train it.
[58:14.140 --> 58:15.740]  It just kept growing straight up.
[58:16.300 --> 58:22.300]  And I wanted, you know, and I like to have wide, bushy plants to fill in canopy space.
[58:23.740 --> 58:27.980]  And so I cloned, I had it and I gave two of the clones to my friend.
[58:27.980 --> 58:29.340]  And I was like, I'm not going to run this.
[58:29.340 --> 58:30.700]  And his dog ate the clones.
[58:30.700 --> 58:31.980]  So I lost the cut.
[58:31.980 --> 58:35.020]  And then after it was finished, I was like, fuck, I wish I had this.
[58:35.020 --> 58:39.580]  It was interesting, though, because the turpin profile wasn't like any of the others.
[58:39.580 --> 58:47.820]  This turpin profile was more like a form cookie cut, except it finished super fast
[58:47.820 --> 58:49.420]  and it just had a different appearance.
[58:50.220 --> 59:00.780]  Really, really tight bud structures, incredibly frosty, had a very pronounced trichome production.
[59:02.060 --> 59:04.780]  Is that the one you is that the one you gave me a sample of last year?
[59:04.780 --> 59:08.220]  No, that was the number five that I gave you.
[59:08.220 --> 59:09.100]  That was another one.
[59:09.100 --> 59:12.780]  That one was the most vigorous out of all the ones that I had found.
[59:12.780 --> 59:19.020]  It also had the narrowest leaf sets, which I like in in cultivars.
[59:19.020 --> 59:24.380]  I like short flowering time with narrow leaf serrations because they allow more light
[59:24.380 --> 59:27.100]  penetration in these canopies.
[59:27.100 --> 59:33.100]  And I can do less pruning and defoliating with those types of varietals.
[59:33.740 --> 59:40.220]  I ran I also ran some purple tapes as well.
[59:41.020 --> 59:44.220]  And that was a it was it was good.
[59:46.060 --> 59:51.900]  It was like a lilac and diesel is the profile that I had pretty much across the board on
[59:51.900 --> 59:52.460]  all of those.
[59:53.740 --> 59:55.020]  I kept one Fino.
[59:55.020 --> 59:58.140]  I've been debating running running it.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.980]  Somebody else out here in Oklahoma has some cuts, different Finos of that.
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.460]  So I'm not sure if I'm going to run it, but I did save it.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.500]  I'm just not sure what I'm going to do with it yet.
[01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:16.570]  Got it.
[01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.830]  So we just did the Mandarin Sunshine, right?
[01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.530]  Yep.
[01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:26.470]  And then do we have any?
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.070]  We do.
[01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:29.990]  Yeah, we talked about the orange gelato.
[01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.790]  That's the new one.
[01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.270]  We have the powwow from Zee Bud.
[01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:41.270]  That is Gypsy Eyes from Bodhi.
[01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:45.110]  I guess he did some hunting and found an awesome female in that stock.
[01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:56.630]  But Gypsy Eyes is, I believe it's Axis across the ADA G13 HP and then across to Bodhi's
[01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:57.670]  OMG also.
[01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:04.390]  So it's like double Bodhi and then we put the purple tapes on it and some interesting
[01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:05.510]  smells are coming off of it.
[01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:06.010]  Sage.
[01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:11.030]  I think that the purple tapes passes a lot of purple smells.
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.830]  That makes sense.
[01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.310]  Brandon just said it himself.
[01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:19.030]  The lilac came through and in this picture one right here, there was actually
[01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:23.190]  homie who ran it for us who was testing it.
[01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.030]  It was a pink Starburst Fino.
[01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:26.070]  He was stoked about it.
[01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:33.110]  But big yields, nice resin production, good mold resistance, pest resistance.
[01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:37.990]  I didn't find that it had the best mold resistance.
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:40.230]  What, the purple tapes one?
[01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.730]  Yeah.
[01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:43.110]  Yeah, it happens, I'm sure.
[01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:47.190]  There was a Fino that did.
[01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:52.710]  I've gotten it with the Cactus Jack too, but I just noticed the other day that we had some
[01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:55.670]  crazy spikes there with the relative humidity.
[01:01:56.390 --> 01:02:00.390]  And the next day I walked in there and there's a little spot and I was like, damn, I didn't
[01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:03.030]  think I could get these equatorials to mold.
[01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:09.110]  Yeah, big fat yields.
[01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.910]  That's the Pow Wow, man.
[01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:16.470]  Sage, candied grapes, lilac, just purple smell.
[01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:19.510]  And then that weird pink Starburst Fino.
[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:26.110]  And I wish Z-Bud was here to talk about it.
[01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:26.830]  He was stoked.
[01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:32.770]  Yeah, it was a really nice plant.
[01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.770]  We'll get him with better reception one day.
[01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:36.530]  Yeah, next time.
[01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:42.430]  Yeah, that one's cool looking.
[01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:45.390]  Like the Congo.
[01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:50.050]  I have that Congo lease cut.
[01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:51.430]  Yeah?
[01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:53.570]  Yeah, Kevin Jodri gave it to me.
[01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:56.290]  Supposed to be legit.
[01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:57.970]  I've heard stories of it.
[01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:02.930]  I was really impressed with all these Swazis, even though I'm growing them outside in the
[01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.930]  fucking freezing cold in Connecticut.
[01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:11.010]  And they didn't start flowering until like end of September, October.
[01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:13.090]  They really started putting on flowers.
[01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.810]  But yeah, it's interesting to run them.
[01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:16.850]  I've got these.
[01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:20.370]  I've got these the seed library that my friend gave me.
[01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:24.210]  He's he's an old head and he gave me a bunch of stuff that's like 20 years old.
[01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:29.090]  And in that and all these different packs of seeds that he gave me, there was three
[01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:35.730]  seeds of some Malawi dog, which is the original Malawi times chem dog.
[01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:40.450]  And I was like, I'm going to pop these.
[01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:44.770]  And I got both of them to germinate, all three of them to germinate.
[01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.770]  And I have one male and two females.
[01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:50.850]  So I'm going to go ahead and knock all those three together.
[01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:56.930]  And then just just for the preservation, because it's a really, really old seed stock.
[01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:00.130]  And I want to preserve that.
[01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.770]  That should be really, really interesting and old Malawi.
[01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:07.330]  Yeah, that was my goal with the Swazi, you know, to increase it.
[01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:14.290]  And then by adding all those other selections and stocks, you know, maybe a little bit more
[01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:18.130]  diverse, but, you know, there's some really interesting things that I'm going to be doing
[01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:22.290]  maybe a little bit more diverse, but, you know, there's some really cool looking stuff.
[01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:27.490]  Lot of awesome, dude, no mold, none of them.
[01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:31.970]  And they're going until I think it was November 22nd.
[01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:38.850]  They were out until but purples, I'm assuming because of the cold, but a lot of a lot of
[01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:45.250]  them all smelled similar, just varying on that sprite citrus nose.
[01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:52.370]  There's some woody smells like cedar sandalwood, but a lot of cool stuff to be found in those
[01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:55.010]  older, longer flowering ones that no one wants to rock.
[01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:03.250]  You know what, I just I got a bunch of test results for the cut that I gave out for the
[01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:08.610]  home grow competition out here in Oklahoma and across the board.
[01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:22.210]  I this variety had a caring as the dominant terpene, and I haven't seen that ever in my
[01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:25.090]  testing, and I've been testing for a really long time.
[01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.610]  So I thought that was really interesting.
[01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:34.610]  Most of the terpenes that you typically see in cannabis, none of them were in the I mean,
[01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:37.650]  it was one point seven.
[01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:39.090]  One of these tests was one point.
[01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:47.170]  It was a four point eight terpene test from a home grower, nonetheless, and he hit one
[01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:49.010]  point seven percent carrying.
[01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:58.210]  The next one was Ocimene, Ocimene, I think, and that was at almost one percent.
[01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:01.570]  And then it was like paraphiline, humaline.
[01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:05.730]  And then at the like the lowest one was maricine, there was barely any pining in it.
[01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.290]  And those are the two of the most common.
[01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:09.810]  Yeah, right.
[01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:14.130]  Yeah, the two most common ones were at the very bottom.
[01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:14.770]  That's awesome.
[01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:26.970]  Yeah, we see maricine and probably pining are probably the two most common that we see on
[01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:27.770]  our test results.
[01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:30.090]  I mean, every five pounds we have to lot up and test out.
[01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.090]  So we're sending out hundreds and hundreds a year.
[01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:40.250]  And generally we see mercine and the pining are like the two that go.
[01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:43.210]  And then you get the limiting, the hydro terp is the limiting.
[01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:46.890]  You'll see super, super strong limiting numbers in a lot of hydro gardens.
[01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:56.810]  So do you see other like higher levels of any of the other cannabinoids with any of
[01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:58.490]  these kind of more exotic varieties?
[01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:06.330]  Interestingly enough, I'm running, I just hunted out this gas from CAP and I found this
[01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:07.930]  one particular pheno.
[01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:14.010]  It finishes super fast and it's super high, two and a half percent in CBGA.
[01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:15.610]  I'm actually trimming some of it right now.
[01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:24.490]  And I'm wondering if you have also seen at your commercial facility different profiles
[01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:33.050]  that are unusual or unique things that don't necessarily, you know, usually correlate with
[01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:38.970]  the terpene chart or the terpene levels, you know, them usually being like pining, limonene,
[01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:39.530]  maricine.
[01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:44.050]  Is that for Nate?
[01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:49.150]  Say that again, Brandon.
[01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.710]  I'm kind of confused at what you're asking.
[01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:54.670]  You're asking if I see anything pop out like as far as the...
[01:07:55.630 --> 01:08:01.310]  On the more exotic varieties that you're running, are you seeing different cannabinoid
[01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:05.390]  and terpene profiles that are different from the norm, the standard?
[01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:15.630]  There's not anything that has been like really, I mean, generally I think we have one that's
[01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:23.070]  got, I think we have a LA Confidential from DNA crossed with I think some of the Wookiee
[01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:25.550]  line, like the LA Afi Wookiee from Bodie.
[01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:31.390]  And I think that one tests pretty high in like osamine.
[01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:35.710]  It's like, you know, that you kind of a terpene that you don't see regularly.
[01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:42.110]  I think that one gets close to at least a percent of osamine on its own.
[01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:46.430]  But outside of that, I don't really think we've had...
[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:51.310]  We've had a few that we've thrown down and they've been like one to one and two to one
[01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:53.630]  CBD to THCs that have come from...
[01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:58.990]  Obviously, the breeders had some pollination issues that we got seeds from and we accidentally...
[01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:04.510]  I guess it was accidental that we actually kept them because, you know, just to have
[01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:08.590]  some of those more CBD type things for the market we're in.
[01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:15.230]  Some of the dispensary market and the legal areas like those CBD flowers.
[01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:21.230]  So, but no, other than that, we're not really seeing anything like that you would call extremely
[01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:23.070]  crazy in any of our terpene profiles.
[01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:24.030]  They're all pretty standard.
[01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:34.270]  So, Microbe, as a breeder, do you see the market shifting at all towards more one to
[01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.390]  ones, higher terps?
[01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:41.070]  Because that's kind of like what I like with the medicine and what I try to aim for is
[01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:43.710]  high terpenes.
[01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:50.350]  But I'd like to see more commercially available one to ones where it might be, you know, 15%,
[01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:56.270]  and maybe like 5% or even like straight across the board if you could get a variety up to
[01:09:56.990 --> 01:10:01.870]  maybe 10% terpenes, 10% THC and 10% CBD and you're producing...
[01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:02.750]  That would be amazing.
[01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:08.990]  You know, I would love to work on a one to one or, you know, something like that for
[01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:13.870]  like true medical, you know, true meds help people out.
[01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:16.350]  But it's not something we've done yet.
[01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:21.630]  I think I put the mimosa on cherry wine.
[01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.990]  That's the only hemp thing or CBD I've ever really done.
[01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:29.710]  I used to have ACDC cut that I liked a lot, but that's one thing that we haven't done
[01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:30.270]  yet.
[01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:35.870]  Messing around with making one to ones or two to ones, anything with a decent amount
[01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.150]  of CBD in there.
[01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:40.190]  And how do you feel about auto flowers?
[01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:42.350]  That's a huge, huge market right now.
[01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:47.310]  I know that a lot of home growers, especially new home growers are really geared towards
[01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:52.270]  auto flowers because of the ease that they can cultivate these things.
[01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:57.950]  Is that something that you might be putting in the works for people that are new growers
[01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:01.070]  that you might be releasing onto the market?
[01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:03.630]  Not myself.
[01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:05.390]  I've never grown an auto flower.
[01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:09.550]  I do want to try this summer.
[01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:12.830]  This summer, the homie Guardian of the Lost Herbs sent me some.
[01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:16.830]  So I definitely want to put out like some bunker plants or signs, take them out there,
[01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:17.550]  see what happens.
[01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:22.750]  But no, I don't see us doing anything like that.
[01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:28.190]  But I don't have any problem steering people that do want auto flowers towards a reputable
[01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:32.270]  person like him that's doing some awesome preservation work.
[01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:36.590]  And he's mixing with modern varieties too.
[01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:40.030]  So he's doing his auto flower thing, Guardian of the Lost Herbs.
[01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:42.190]  So if you want auto flowers, that's where you need to get them at.
[01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:46.030]  Yeah, I've done some work with some of his varietals.
[01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:49.630]  I actually have some of his genetics that I'm hunting through in the greenhouse right
[01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:50.130]  now.
[01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:51.790]  Yeah, he's a very nice guy.
[01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:53.630]  Good dude.
[01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:58.750]  Yeah, I think he's going to possibly be coming out here maybe next spring to help do some
[01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:01.470]  cultivating on the outdoor on the farm.
[01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.510]  We'll see.
[01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:06.270]  The triple purple diesel cross double purple.
[01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:08.270]  Oh, yeah, dude, it's doing amazing.
[01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:09.470]  I have some of that going.
[01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:13.630]  I have some of the Blackberry Royal cross that he made.
[01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:17.870]  And then I have some of the cotton candy mimosa times Sky Cuddler Kush.
[01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:19.230]  That sounds awesome.
[01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:26.350]  I think, Larry, you got some of those going right without the Sky Cuddler, just the cotton
[01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.850]  candy.
[01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:30.370]  Yeah, I should cut some of those down the other day.
[01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:32.930]  I think they're about like almost a day 80 or so.
[01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:36.930]  And they took me almost like a couple of weeks to grow them out.
[01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:38.450]  I didn't think they were going to finish.
[01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:42.610]  I was like, damn, this just a plan to go for like 100 days or something like they're going
[01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:43.330]  for a minute, though.
[01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:46.210]  But yeah, I just cut them down the other day.
[01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:49.730]  They're like maybe the size of baseballs on the top.
[01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:52.930]  No, because I dropped the next like a few inches to where they're off.
[01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:56.770]  Baseball's on the top of that because I dropped the next like a few inches to where they're
[01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:57.730]  almost like touching them.
[01:12:57.730 --> 01:12:59.490]  And they just like blew up in size.
[01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:00.130]  I was like, this was.
[01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:12.610]  And I like his genetics to where those grow out the the platinum purple berry cookies
[01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.610]  plus with one of the.
[01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:17.170]  Yeah, there's a Northern Lights on it or something.
[01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:18.130]  And then he sent me.
[01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.410]  Yeah, he sent me some more of that and I grew up to and.
[01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:25.810]  Just remember the name.
[01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.890]  But yeah, there's a fire and shit.
[01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:30.370]  All the subjects, I sent him some red tie.
[01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:31.730]  I'm excited to see what he does with that.
[01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:33.090]  I guess he's popping a bunch of tie.
[01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:35.970]  So I had to send him some.
[01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:38.210]  I think it's from the Karen driver sign.
[01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:41.090]  Forget whose it was, but that'll be interesting, too.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.500]  He has fire genetics, too, though.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.140]  So you want to do that orange iron lotus right here?
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.820]  You talk about his.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.740]  He's got a couple going, I think one or two of them right now.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.100]  Turpacom he showed us before.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.300]  I don't think he's in here anymore.
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:02.340]  But yeah.
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:05.860]  That's yeah, I got.
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.140]  Sorry.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:08.740]  Go ahead, dude.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.340]  I got two of them going right now.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.060]  Honestly, my favorite part about them is they're pretty much just like
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:26.340]  GMO, but a lot shorter and a lot finish a lot, a lot quicker finishing flowering time.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:31.940]  They've got this really greasy turf profile, too.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.180]  And there's not a hint of orange in them.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.380]  I mean, I've tried.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.020]  I've finger fucked them and pulled them apart.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.420]  And you can't smell any orange in them.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.260]  It literally smells like a sack of cheeseburgers that got left in a car for a day or two.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.700]  I don't know if any of you guys have ever done that before.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.580]  But it's dead on.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.100]  It's just I love this.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.060]  You're wrong.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.820]  Who would have thought cheeseburger turps?
[01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:02.610]  I had to cut a GMO a couple of years ago that had it was really faint,
[01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:05.810]  but it got magnified with this somehow, man.
[01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:08.210]  And it's just it stinks to high heaven, man.
[01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:10.130]  There's the two different phenos I'm running.
[01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:13.250]  There's that one that just went single call on me.
[01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:14.850]  And it's really chunky.
[01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:19.410]  But the other one is going to be something a lot more special because it's just great.
[01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:24.770]  It's just so you must have found one of the special ones in there because
[01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:31.170]  Turp was telling me he's found everywhere, you know, GMO leaning like these ones photo.
[01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:35.730]  Those are his GMO leaning ones, you know, and then you got your poison mimosa ones.
[01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:41.570]  There's your more orange and a nice blend of them with like, you know, orange funk and body odor.
[01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:46.050]  But definitely the funk.
[01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:47.270]  Sure.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:54.060]  I mean, it's still got two weeks, so they could change, man.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:57.980]  I'm curious to see the final product if there's a little hint of orange hiding in there.
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:01.100]  But I mean, so far, it doesn't look like it.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.500]  Yeah, that's going to be something nice.
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.060]  I just I just wanted a quicker GMO.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.380]  Yeah, these two cuts that I have.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:17.380]  At first, I was leaning more towards the single call the one.
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:22.900]  But after seeing about a week or two extra time on it, man, that other one is just
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.900]  it wasn't looking too special in the beginning like it was going on.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:31.140]  It was neck and neck with the other one, but the other one was just so much chunkier.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.940]  But man, just the grease, dude.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.980]  I love those greasy turf when you just touch it.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.420]  And it's like it's not even like it fucking smears on you, dude.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.980]  And there's no getting it off.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:43.860]  What else you got in there?
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:45.460]  You got that uptown orange going to.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.760]  Yes, I'm stoked about those.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.680]  Those are I got three of them in the back row, man.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.040]  And there's one that keeps catching my eye that one in the center.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.200]  I know I sent you a shit ton of pictures of it, man.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:00.760]  The radio.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:03.880]  I love it.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.960]  It's I I just I can't even think of a more proper name for it.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.480]  It's just the same thing.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.760]  It's just it's a lot of funk.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.600]  There's really no orange to it.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.880]  I can definitely get a little bit of haze in there.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.080]  And, you know, I'm guessing it's still got at least three weeks.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.120]  It doesn't look like it's going to be quite done.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:29.160]  Like it's chunked up and it's nice and frosted, but it's still just it's got that look.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.640]  I'm pretty sure it's going to be 13 weeks.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:41.400]  I mean, I know the S1 is a little bit faster than the original Cuban black, but I'll take
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.520]  what I can get, man.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.960]  13 weeks, 12 weeks.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.160]  It'll be nice.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.080]  Even 12 would be solid.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:51.240]  There's there's one the the more single stock to one in the back corner.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:56.120]  It looks like it might be 12 weeks, but that one in the center and the one on the other
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.200]  side of it, it's it's definitely going to go a little more because you look close and
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.280]  it's still completely white haired over.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.320]  Nothing has changed.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.880]  It's just and it keeps stacking.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.040]  It keeps stacking every other day, man.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:13.240]  I noticed differences, especially the lower down now like it's I'm excited about that.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:19.160]  And then there was that deep line alchemy, I think.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.880]  But I think that was it.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:28.120]  Yeah, I just I only had one of those in there and it's it stayed pretty small.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:33.080]  I don't know if it was just a tiny seed or what, but I just kind of let it do its thing
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.240]  and it's it's looking pretty nice.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.320]  It's they all have that same funk, man.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.360]  I swear like that.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.960]  Oh, yeah, I forgot you had those too.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.960]  Every single one just had.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.600]  Yeah, the liquid swords is what I got the most variation in.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.200]  You know, the you can see the you can see the variation in all of them.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.480]  But I remember like I showed you that one picture where it looked like it was probably
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.400]  going to I don't even know how long it was going to go like it's still like in comparison
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.600]  to that picture I sent you.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.880]  It's barely stacked at all.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.840]  It's just like it's going but it's going real slow.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.560]  And then you got one on the other side that is just fucking huge.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:15.080]  So but they've all got that same camp so I dig it.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.140]  So.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.760]  Of the things we threw up on the screen, what washes well?
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:34.200]  I mean, I can assume, but I don't have a freeze dryer, so I don't bother freezing any of my
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.800]  bud, try to wash it.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:42.360]  But I mean, if I was a guest, I'll savor the ice cream cake is going to dump.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.160]  I mean, the Valley Orange.
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:54.040]  So a lot of these newer varieties, anything with gelato in it, wedding cake, the Ziggy
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.120]  Stardog, I think that one's going to do really well.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:01.080]  My buddy was telling me he's got great luck washing the Corey cut a Stardog.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:11.880]  I've washed the murderous precision, the My Zest Phenol, and then there has the Sun God.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:18.120]  I know the phenol that we kept at the commercial facility is going to dump just the way that
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.120]  it trims up in the trim bins.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.840]  You can see just the head separate extremely easy.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:29.240]  I actually have some of the, I don't have a freeze dryer either, but I have a freeze
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.080]  dryer, so my shit's a little bit, it doesn't, there we go.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:41.800]  It's a little bit not great for, the color's a little bit off, but you'll see in the normal.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.960]  But the murderous precision, very good hash strain, really resinous.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.960]  It's really cakey.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.520]  Super hard to play with though.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.360]  Once, when you're doing it like a fresh run, it's extremely, extremely sticky.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.520]  You got to be really, really careful with when you're handling it.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:05.800]  There pretty much goes in and out of the freezer every two to three minutes when I'm trying to
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.600]  collect it or any sort of thing, just get some water out of it.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:15.320]  Obviously, without the freeze dryer, you got to do a little bit more old school techniques
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.800]  to try and get the hash to dry properly.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.960]  The other one that I want to wash is the screwdriver.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:30.120]  Just the resin production that we had with it, it was very, very, it was just caked and the
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.160]  grease, just the smell, is just going to be a really good flavor.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.960]  It's going to be really fruit punchy, so it should make pretty good hash.
[01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:45.970]  Got it.
[01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:51.250]  So we-
[01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:52.690]  We got to work, I don't know where we went.
[01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:59.700]  Yeah, now we got a couple people who fell off.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.500]  Mike was quiet and then dropped off.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:10.820]  But let me ask you this, do you want to take a turn into Jerry Springer land?
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:12.900]  Not really.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.340]  I'm not going to feed into that, dude.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:14.820]  Okay.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:19.540]  Brandon, what are you smoking on right now?
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.220]  Wait, hold on.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:24.020]  Let's unmute you.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.620]  Oh, you got to unmute yourself.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:28.740]  Yeah.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.020]  Sorry.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.140]  Sour cheese berry.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:31.940]  I like the pipe.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.220]  Can we see the pipe again?
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:34.580]  Oh, yeah.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.140]  Very nice.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.140]  That's dope.
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:38.500]  Yeah.
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:45.620]  So I did a big pheno hunt at my facility.
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:50.100]  I actually did some of my microbes gear.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:53.300]  I did a bunch of people's stuff.
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.220]  I did some of Masonic's stuff too.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.100]  I did some cap gear.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.220]  I did some second generation genetics.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.020]  I did a bunch of stuff.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:06.900]  I did a bunch of my stuff and this particular phenom, if you can see it.
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:15.860]  I gave this cut out to the Homegrow contestants for the cup out here in Oklahoma.
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:21.060]  And I got a lot of test results back and they're coming back.
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:24.340]  People are emailing them to me and I'm looking over all the results.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.300]  Consistently across the board thus far.
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:32.740]  I think the lowest terpene result has been two and a half percent.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:39.460]  And the highest for the Homegrowers has been four point, I think it was 4.8.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:46.260]  So I'm really, really satisfied because when I know this is a legit cut,
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.020]  I've run a ton of this at my facility.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.620]  It's super awesome.
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.660]  Great numbers on it.
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:51.540]  Great profile.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.580]  Good smoke.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.620]  Mold resistant.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.420]  Grows fast.
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.220]  Finishes quick.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.380]  It's everything I could ask for.
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:01.780]  But then when you get to see other people, that's one of the good things about breeding too.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:07.060]  Because you're seeing how other people are using the varieties.
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.700]  And they all have different growth styles.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:15.860]  So I saw consistency across the board as far as the dominant terpene profiles.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:22.260]  The high percentage of terpenes in combination with really, really decent THC numbers.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.820]  The highest was 29 percent.
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.660]  I think the lowest I saw was 22.
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.780]  So it's a really solid variety.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.740]  And I'm really happy.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.020]  And I love smoking it.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:36.180]  It's that and the Death Breath are like my two favorites right now.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.000]  I'm reading the chat, Heckler.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:52.560]  All right, how about this?
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:59.760]  When Missonic comes on either tomorrow or whenever he comes on, he can have his...
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:09.920]  It's like a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate where each person gets an hour to make their point.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.240]  The other person gets a half hour to rebut.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.160]  Steve Blanco.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.000]  Oh, so Brandon, this one's for you.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:22.480]  Shoot.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:23.360]  Okay.
[01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:30.470]  Okay, so the Cowboy Cup event turned out really, really well.
[01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:32.630]  They could tighten a little things up.
[01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:36.310]  I think that the two guys that put it on might...
[01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:41.030]  You know, they have so much on their plate and they do a really good job.
[01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:44.630]  That event is going to grow huge over the next couple years.
[01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:51.430]  It's kind of the equivalent, in my opinion, to Emerald Cup for California.
[01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:54.870]  I'm really happy with the turnout.
[01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:56.790]  We had some good musicians come out and play.
[01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:59.750]  We had good panel members for speaking.
[01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.590]  All the booths were set up really nice.
[01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:03.670]  I mean, it was great.
[01:26:03.670 --> 01:26:05.350]  I had a really great time.
[01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:09.910]  One of the things that I really missed this year is being able to go to the Emerald Cup.
[01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:16.070]  That's like one time a year where you get to see all your industry friends in the same place.
[01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:20.310]  You know, you get to chop it up, talk about all the things you've been doing over the year,
[01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:25.910]  trade your genetics, trade seeds, smoke weed that you wouldn't normally be able to smoke with your
[01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:26.410]  friends.
[01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:32.070]  It's a huge community and there's huge camaraderie that goes along with that.
[01:26:33.670 --> 01:26:38.070]  Unfortunately, since 2020 has been a complete shitshow.
[01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:42.870]  It's something that I was really stoked to be able to have an event.
[01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:50.550]  You know, I got to see Patrick King and I got to see my friend James and I got to see some
[01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:51.830]  other people that came out.
[01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:54.710]  So it's really neat.
[01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:56.630]  It's going to grow bigger and bigger every year.
[01:26:56.630 --> 01:27:00.950]  That tumbleweed dance hall is not going to be big enough to hold that event for long.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.240]  Sorry, I was looking for the thumbs up emoji.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.640]  He's got like eight different of his own accounts in here.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.240]  And by the way, Nate, what do you have running?
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.280]  Are you listening to this conversation in the back?
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.240]  Because every time you unmute, I hear like a talk show in the background.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.160]  Oh, it might be the TV.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:36.640]  I'm sorry.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.680]  I'm trimming right here.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.280]  So I'm listening and I'm trying to put on my headphones and stuff so it doesn't there's no
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.040]  background noise.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.400]  But that's my bad.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.280]  I'm trying to keep it.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:50.800]  All right.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.760]  So it was the TV.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.000]  I was like, it sounds like he has a talk show in the background.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.320]  Yeah, we're wide.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.080]  I don't know what game we got football on going on in the background.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.600]  I think Packers or something.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:07.600]  Yeah, I missed an entire day of football today.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.040]  Did the Jets win?
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.400]  Let me actually check out.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:14.560]  I think they were winning.
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:21.460]  No, the Jets are 0-12.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:23.780]  They lost to the Raiders.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.780]  And then let me see the Patriots.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.100]  Patriots, where are you?
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:34.540]  Wow, New Orleans barely beat Atlanta.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.740]  Did the Patriots not play yet?
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:40.780]  Oh, fuck.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.100]  Oh, it's still on.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:44.940]  I could watch it.
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.620]  The Patriots are beating the Chargers 35-0.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:50.380]  That's very satisfying.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:57.500]  Being from San Diego, I remember when the Chargers left.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:04.540]  Literally, people who are diehard Charger fans were just taking their gear and piling up and burning it.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.540]  Burning it?
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:07.580]  Burning their jerseys.
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:10.300]  They were so pissed at the Spanos family.
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.340]  Well, it's like Raiders fans.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:18.620]  I mean, the Raiders moved like LA, Oakland, LA, like back and forth.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:22.540]  And then Patriots are the new Jets.
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.900]  Oh, ouch.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:25.260]  Let's see.
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.780]  Let's see.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:33.340]  I don't know.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.660]  It's been a good 20-year run in New England.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:42.140]  So not just the Patriots, but when all four teams win something.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.850]  And I see you, Lemon Hoko.
[01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:51.890]  But anyway, with...
[01:29:54.610 --> 01:29:57.260]  First of all, I got...
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.100]  I was not lying to you.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:04.380]  I was not lying when I said I needed to go get super high between the last show and this show.
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.780]  In preparation for this show, so I could be zen-like.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.020]  And I feel like I handled the...
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.820]  I counterbalanced.
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:17.740]  I had you guys on one side, the chat on the other side.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.700]  I'm giving myself a pat on the back right now.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:23.500]  There you go.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.660]  I don't care if no one else gives me a pat on the back.
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:29.180]  And Masonic, you guys, you can come on tomorrow or the next day.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.660]  And we'll let you speak your piece.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.300]  Talk about me all day tomorrow, sweetheart.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:39.820]  And Brandon, I'm excited.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.900]  We need to launch the Brandon Rush Show.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:44.700]  Now that you have your...
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:45.740]  Look at that.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.300]  You got your...
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:47.980]  Looks pro, man.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:54.220]  Well, once I get my camera set up, I should be able to float through space with the green screen.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.500]  The green screen.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.900]  Wait, we can put you in a...
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.820]  Smoke that face, man.
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:03.900]  I want like ancient aliens with action bronze and meat, soil science.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:04.620]  There you go.
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.180]  I can do that.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.580]  We can talk about Terra...
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.060]  What is it?
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.380]  Petra Terra, Terra Petra?
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:13.900]  Whatever that means.
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:14.620]  Whatever.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.980]  No, the ancient biochar soil.
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:18.540]  Oh, damn.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:20.140]  Now you're really going deep.
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:22.220]  We got to talk about these ancient aliens.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:31.500]  That's a really fun subject to talk about while you're baked for sure.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:35.420]  Yes, anything space related.
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:38.380]  There we go.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:41.260]  I like the mind hive or the hive whatever.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:42.780]  You know, I like...
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.580]  The chat hive.
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.660]  Mentally stimulating varieties for me.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:48.780]  The ones that I really like.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:53.020]  Put you in a new space mentally.
[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.100]  Those are my favorites.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:56.220]  Hold on.
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.860]  I'm going to say, Jord Bang, I stand by my body of work.
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:09.420]  Anyway.
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:16.140]  But anyway, hey, I got to go because at six I have the Cheap Home Grow podcast.
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:23.020]  All right, well, Brandon, I'll check in with you maybe tomorrow.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.420]  And we'll get something going soon.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:33.340]  I think we can wrap up this episode so I can watch the third and fourth quarter of the Patriots game.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.460]  Can I get some love for New England?
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:39.660]  I mean, you're in New England.
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:43.660]  Yeah, I hated Tom Brady, but now I don't mind the Pats now.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.500]  Well, what team did you like?
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.820]  My pops played football at the University of Tennessee back in the day.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.900]  So I've always been a huge Peyton Manning fan.
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:53.200]  Oof.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.160]  I'm sorry.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:02.160]  I can understand why people hated Tom Brady, but I never liked Peyton Manning.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:03.760]  Polarizing.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.760]  So anyway, but all right.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.480]  Well, thank you guys all for jumping on.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:14.880]  This was the largest conversation I've ever done.
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.560]  Thank you, the peanut gallery.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.600]  Do you have something you want to say to the peanut gallery?
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.480]  Love and miss you.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.440]  Wait, sorry.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.080]  We got.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.440]  Fight now.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.200]  You can't say fuck the Patriots.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:32.880]  Yeah, here we go.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.000]  This makes me happier.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.520]  I'm a total New England homer.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:43.280]  I mean, every sport like I lived in New York for 13 years and I had to like I went to Red Sox,
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.480]  Yankees games.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.000]  And I'm a total New England homer.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.600]  And now I live in L.A. so like Lakers, Celtics.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.960]  And it was very satisfying when the Red Sox beat the Dodgers in the World Series.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.120]  So anyway, that's my my New England homerism.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.400]  But all right.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.680]  Well, thank you guys.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:13.520]  And we will we will be back soon.
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:15.200]  Have a good night.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:16.480]  All right.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:19.040]  See you guys.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.920]  And Larry, get out of that.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:22.480]  You're going to.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.080]  I got to go.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.200]  I got to tend the garden.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.200]  I got a clone and do some other stuff.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.640]  So yeah, you're a true.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.760]  Wait, let me see the hat.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:35.440]  Lean that.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.720]  I was humble to you.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.440]  Hold on.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:38.560]  Hold on.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.680]  You know.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.200]  I mean, this one's this one.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:49.520]  All right.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.560]  We got to fix this.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:56.400]  We got I can rock the Humboldt seed company.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.360]  Not for sure.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.480]  I'm actually running some of the new Jelly Ranchers, too.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:01.920]  What's that?
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.840]  I'm actually rocking some of the new Jelly Ranchers train right now, too.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:11.280]  Well, I want to I want to have Nat come on maybe next week.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:19.520]  I have a whole bunch of like this is all I have like freak show Magic Melon.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:27.020]  Yeah, there's the freak show.
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:30.940]  Yeah, actually, across a couple of is a strange.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.140]  They even cross the Magic Melon to Josie Wells, Gigi for.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.180]  So how about one of those?
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:39.100]  Wait, sorry, you're you're in L.A., right?
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:44.220]  I'm in a like actual like where San Diego is that in the bottom left side of Cali?
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.260]  I'm in the bottom right side.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:46.860]  Got it.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.180]  Got it.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:47.500]  Got it.
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.660]  Yeah, no, we need to because I'm in L.A.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:51.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.260]  L.A. like three or four hours away.
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:55.500]  Like more northwest.
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.940]  But I'm like in a bottom bottom right.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:00.460]  But yeah.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:04.620]  So that's Brandon's home turf, too, right?
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.700]  Yeah, well, Brandon was in San Diego on the other side of the mountain.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:11.420]  He was probably like an hour and a half or two away.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.820]  And then that's when he left Oklahoma.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:17.260]  I would actually go there to his house a couple of times over there to where
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.700]  he was doing stuff or whatever.
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:23.820]  And then before that's what he said.
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.260]  So actually, let's all right, Edgar, we're going to bring you on.
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:33.340]  Why don't I bring if Edgar is still watching?
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:38.380]  Give me one second.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:40.940]  Oh, you know what I can do with someone negative in the comments.
[01:36:44.150 --> 01:36:46.150]  All right, we'll do the Edgar.
[01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:02.530]  I was going to put these up on the site soon.
[01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:11.330]  Because I have a but I'm going to I've got a lot of stuff I got to work on, but.
[01:37:12.930 --> 01:37:18.210]  And then I'm like, Don Carlos and then the very cherry.
[01:37:18.210 --> 01:37:23.170]  And then I have other seeds that I have or like a notorious TSC, the family jewels,
[01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:31.330]  the caramel cream, the freaking raspberry parfait, the calling man,
[01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:37.250]  Kush, the trip to the tree and a couple of other ones I can't name off of my list.
[01:37:39.650 --> 01:37:44.930]  OK, so if if Edgar is still there, I did send you a link to jump on.
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:53.740]  And I'm I'm I'm excited to see how many thumbs down.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.120]  Spot check news, he's already gone.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.800]  I but we can get answers for you.
[01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:11.630]  So let's see if Edgar.
[01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:20.750]  Jumps on and while we're waiting, I'm going to get another beer because it's football time.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.400]  There we go.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.360]  Fish I supply with the thumbs up.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.320]  We're getting some love and appreciation.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.000]  So you you've been I love.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.640]  Can you flip the camera and show me the lights that you're sitting under right now?
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.600]  Yeah, I get this going.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:02.580]  Thank you, Sean.
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.380]  This is the next light mega.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:07.860]  I actually won this from a contest on Instagram.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.260]  What what lighting company?
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.140]  Well, I got it from Agron.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.120]  The.
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.620]  I guess they're like a hydroponic and wholesale.
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:25.860]  And then this one might be overkill from my grill tent, my two by four,
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:32.020]  but some 550 next light and not next to the 550 V2 from
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:33.860]  Horticulture Lighting Group.
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.060]  Horticulture Lighting Group.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:47.720]  Yeah, I keep getting Chinese companies that send me lights and their big thing is
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.920]  unboxing videos.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.560]  So can anybody who's been approached about doing unboxing videos?
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.880]  Now, I got a couple of reach out to me, too.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.480]  And see, like these are some testers right here from Romland Genetics,
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:09.880]  some burning cap, Mac one cross with rents cross to is Romulan.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.080]  And then these are like the jelly ranchers over here.
[01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:25.410]  But the light might be a little bit of overkill, but I might swap it out
[01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:29.010]  because it's halfway done, but I think even so,
[01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:32.530]  then I even have a little mango tree growing in here, too.
[01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:34.610]  It's nice.
[01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:37.170]  A mango tree that's never going to see natural sunlight.
[01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:41.810]  It will do in the summer when it's a little bit better outside.
[01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:46.130]  But right now, the humidity is real low outside, probably like at what, 15 to 30.
[01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:49.250]  So a mango tree wouldn't.
[01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:52.690]  Oh, my God, look, look who showed up.
[01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:57.330]  You got the kids in the background.
[01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:58.450]  So I want to.
[01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:04.370]  I need to connect a headphone, the headphone to work on this.
[01:41:04.930 --> 01:41:07.170]  No, you actually you actually sound great.
[01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:11.090]  I sound great. Well, that's good. I can I can kind of hear you, but I can't hear.
[01:41:12.450 --> 01:41:14.930]  It is on. You can hear I can't hear.
[01:41:16.290 --> 01:41:18.290]  Does it need a dual, the dual one?
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:24.140]  This what is this? This isn't connected at all.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:26.700]  What do you turn on?
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.540]  I don't know.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.180]  OK, well, that's cool. I can't hear it.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:34.700]  Give me a second. My other one.
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.540]  I love that the wife's doing tech support.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:39.260]  I don't know why this is connected. Can you hear me now?
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:41.660]  Check one, check two, check three.
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:42.940]  You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:45.260]  I can hear you on the laptop, but that's not where I want to hear you.
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:50.460]  We've told you the whole time we've heard you actually sound better than 99% of the people.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:52.780]  So whatever audio input I think it's your little.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:57.260]  It's this little girl, a little call center microphone that I do.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.820]  Are you standing by a lot of customers?
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:00.320]  No.
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:08.360]  Well, you know what I noticed from that interview was never, not once.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.160]  Like did he he didn't have nothing to do with any of the plants physically in front of him.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.840]  Everything was from somebody else's.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.040]  He was vicariously selecting stuff through everybody else.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:23.080]  So safe to say that that dude didn't do shit, you know, from the poison mimosa.
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.480]  The poison mimosa till everything that's been made because poison mimosa being the building block
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:31.240]  and everybody else doing the work for it, including the poison mimosa,
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:36.120]  safe to say microbe hasn't done shit himself physically with his own hands.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.040]  Is that true?
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:38.680]  Or is that false?
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:42.360]  I have no idea.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:46.520]  That's what I got from the interview.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.840]  And then what I also got from the interview was the first batch of poison mimosa seeds.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.960]  I heard something about I have to go back to the video, but there was something about,
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.120]  oh, that some labels got mixed around.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.440]  So there was only a small batch of the first drop.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.360]  I think he even said a number.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.040]  I think he even said like 30.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:06.040]  Maybe I'm wrong, but it was a small number.
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:09.400]  But dude, like how did so many people end up with it?
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:12.920]  How did I end up with 12 if there was I forget what fucking number he said,
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.360]  but I'm imagining he said a number from what I remember.
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:22.360]  But yeah, a whole lot of bullshit and never not once I heard no eyes.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:29.160]  I heard we them, they him, her never not me fucking microbe alchemist
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.680]  did shit with my two hands.
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:32.280]  Not once, never not once did I hear that.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.160]  OK, but on.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:37.960]  I can't hear shit.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.160]  Take it off what you had it on.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.120]  You say that would get it.
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.240]  I hear the chickens.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:45.800]  Can you hear me?
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.560]  And that whatever you put for audio, just take it off.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.040]  Microphone check one to what is this?
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.720]  All right, I can hear now.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.360]  Can you hear me now?
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.520]  Yeah, I'll just listen like this.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.000]  All right.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.560]  Well, one, I got a P and two, I want a beer.
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:04.440]  But well, I mean, I I wish he was on here with you, right?
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:10.280]  Because this is I wanted I actually wanted Brandon to take my like me to tap out and
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:16.280]  Brandon to tap in and then you guys and then I eventually wanted it to end with you guys
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.400]  being like my my two happy daughters in this picture.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:23.080]  Friends like BFFs.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:25.800]  I do I do everything myself.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.320]  I made my own mail.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.640]  I did everything and he wants to be like at my level, even stoop me as low as him.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.040]  And that's where like, yeah, it was friendly competition.
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:37.960]  But he would say I have to gear just put out false information.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:41.960]  I've never if I've to anybody's gear besides mine with the mail that I built.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.160]  So he would put out all this shit, just basically demean me.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.680]  And look who's actually doing work.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.960]  I got a store on Fairfax.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.920]  I got a book.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.640]  I'm in metric, you know, all these fucking things.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.320]  And meanwhile, you got micro alchemists with nine dudes on the screen who aren't saying
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:55.560]  shit.
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.280]  They're just fucking fucking most boring shit I've ever seen here.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.200]  Did anybody like today's show?
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.360]  I don't think you've ever got more dislikes ever, dude.
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.600]  I know you brought the dislike.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:11.480]  What's that?
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.160]  People like drama.
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.440]  That's where my son comes in.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.480]  People like real people want real.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:21.800]  And I expose the fucking assholes every time they mention sung on purple tapes.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.600]  I don't like the party.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.760]  I like the poly crosses.
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:25.080]  Never.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.200]  Not once did he stop and say, yo, I didn't make those.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.040]  By the way, I don't like the guy that made those.
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:33.240]  But he's still went ahead and built his platform with all those dude strains.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:36.440]  Where's all the anger from stemming from who hurt you?
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:38.440]  No, we're talking about we do.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.840]  We're not talking about speculation and drama.
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.040]  We're talking about facts.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.320]  I'm saying facts.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.120]  When you're raging, could you live in San Diego?
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:47.240]  Like, be quiet.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.680]  I don't live in San Diego, but good.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:51.000]  All right.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:51.800]  What else did I got?
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.160]  How many plants did he personally manage ever?
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.120]  Point blank period.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.160]  Dude probably grew 30 plants in his whole fucking life.
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.480]  He needs to be quiet when he talks about selection.
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.480]  Is PM is poison mimosa good for hash?
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:09.480]  I reached out on a secret account and hit up Boston Loudest because he had a picture on
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:12.360]  his page that said poison mimosa dumps hash.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.080]  So I went on him and I'm like, yeah, I heard, you know, I'm a huge fan.
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.440]  I heard poison most of dumps.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.560]  He's like, yeah, yeah, it does.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.280]  Four to six.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.960]  I'm like, who gave you four to six?
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:20.520]  Matt Hasher.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:21.560]  I hit a Matt Hasher.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.480]  You want to know what Matt Hasher said?
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:30.120]  It did 0.5 hash 17 grams of rousing out of 4.5 kilos of whole plant fresh frozen poison.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:32.840]  Mimosa does not dump three thumbs down.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.200]  Larry.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.640]  Oh, oh,
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.320]  it's full of rage.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.120]  I smoke, bro.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:42.760]  I'm just chill.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:43.400]  I smoke too.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:44.440]  I smoke better than you.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.880]  Everybody knows I smoke.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:49.080]  I'm just, you know, you're messing with the headhunter right now.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.360]  Positive vibes.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.520]  That's a bad high.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.080]  I'm not waiting anymore.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:01.960]  So hold your note sheets up because that's out of like a like a notebook.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:02.680]  I love it.
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:04.680]  Oh, bro, who are you talking to?
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:05.880]  You were Francis.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.720]  You're writing shit.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:07.960]  All right.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:08.600]  So what else?
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.760]  Oh, that's that's about it.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.280]  Like he didn't make shit.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.000]  He didn't touch.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:13.240]  Never.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:13.720]  Not once.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:19.160]  He talks about I do stuff selectively, you know, according to a code.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.880]  Dude, you never touch the fucking plant in your life.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.480]  As far as everything that's been made, the pollen that he used for poison.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.760]  Mimosa was donated from King J Garden, somebody who he left with bad amends and bad fucking
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.000]  blood every time he makes something with somebody.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.720]  Sean P. Ferguson put out more than more than fucking seven strains for him.

[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.020]  I've been to Boston.
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:37.660]  I've been to Maine.
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:38.940]  I've been to Oklahoma.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.540]  I've been to Emerald Cup twice.
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.900]  You know, I've been everywhere.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.820]  You never see these guys anywhere.
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:45.820]  You never you'll never see these guys anywhere.
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:46.860]  They can't show their face.
[01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:48.780]  They can't show their face.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:51.420]  A bunch of freaking weirdos.
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:58.620]  You're not allowed at the shows, not because you're banned from the show, but because Masonic
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:01.980]  and real people will be there to tell you you're not real.
[01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:07.090]  Larry, the last word.
[01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:10.450]  And I get to I get to watch my Patriots.
[01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:14.050]  And yeah, I'm just trying to mellow out.
[01:50:14.050 --> 01:50:17.010]  I don't know what he's about, but I'm you know what I'm about.
[01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:18.290]  I'm microbes, daddy, baby.
[01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:21.570]  Everything I did, I set the blueprint for that.
[01:50:21.570 --> 01:50:23.170]  I'm everything he did.
[01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:25.170]  Copy paste, copy paste, even the art.
[01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:28.770]  One of the first arts he got, he reached out to the artist or I don't know where he thought
[01:50:28.770 --> 01:50:32.370]  it was a good idea to do that, too, and be like, oh, I'm going to use the same art, dude.
[01:50:32.370 --> 01:50:35.730]  Either you like me, don't go using the fucking artists I got.
[01:50:35.730 --> 01:50:39.810]  And that's just one of many things that he that, you know, whatever.
[01:50:39.810 --> 01:50:41.970]  Everybody gets the muse and nothing's original.
[01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:42.290]  I get it.
[01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:45.490]  But that dude is just a terrible copy, not even a good one.
[01:50:46.130 --> 01:50:48.210]  You stop drinking and start smoking.
[01:50:48.210 --> 01:50:49.570]  Just know how you're stupid.
[01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:51.970]  I'm fucking been sober for more than 100 days, dummy.
[01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:55.650]  I shut the fuck up.
[01:50:57.650 --> 01:50:58.290]  I doubt it.
[01:51:00.210 --> 01:51:00.530]  All right.
[01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:06.770]  With that, we're going to we're going to end on a kumbaya moment.
[01:51:07.730 --> 01:51:10.530]  You know, one of these motherfuckers suck balls.
[01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:13.810]  Like the picture, like hand in hand together in the community.

[01:51:15.570 --> 01:51:17.170]  I'm a fucking part of no community.
[01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:17.890]  Shut the fuck up.
[01:51:17.890 --> 01:51:20.530]  Yeah, just nine motherfuckers over there, circling, jerking each other.
[01:51:21.170 --> 01:51:25.090]  OK, you guys got like 100 dislikes, dude.
[01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:26.050]  Nobody likes you guys.
[01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:30.610]  Three times down.
[01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:32.370]  All right.
[01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:34.770]  But all right.
[01:51:34.770 --> 01:51:35.250]  Peace out.
[01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:36.210]  All right.
[01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:36.930]  See you guys.
