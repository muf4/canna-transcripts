[00:00.000 --> 00:08.720]  We are now live for those who are still awake at my bedtime, which is about nine o'clock
[00:08.720 --> 00:09.720]  Pacific time.
[00:09.720 --> 00:13.840]  So Joey, why don't you take it away?
[00:13.840 --> 00:21.080]  Yeah, well, thank you for having us here tonight, Peter, and opening your channel up for us.
[00:21.080 --> 00:22.840]  Tonight is a celebration of hash.
[00:22.840 --> 00:23.840]  My name is Joey.
[00:23.840 --> 00:47.000]  My partner, Tamara, and I are going to be hosting a hash camp this weekend up here in
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.320]  Middletown in Lake County in Northern California.
[00:50.320 --> 00:54.320]  And Tamara and I have been in the cannabis industry a long time and hosting a lot of
[00:54.320 --> 00:58.960]  events for the last couple of years, and mostly around regenerative cannabis, regenerative
[00:58.960 --> 01:00.040]  farming.
[01:00.040 --> 01:04.800]  And you can't be into cannabis these days if you're not into hash and vice versa.
[01:04.800 --> 01:10.040]  And we wanted to start including hash camp in our regenerative workshops and in our weekend
[01:10.040 --> 01:11.280]  offerings.
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.320]  So we're fortunate enough to be in a community of so many incredible hashicians, our good
[01:17.320 --> 01:18.320]  admire and look up to.
[01:18.320 --> 01:24.520]  Honored to have a bunch of these folks joining us at camp to share their knowledge.
[01:24.520 --> 01:29.280]  And these guys and gals are going to be joining us tonight, talk a little bit about what we're
[01:29.280 --> 01:35.720]  going to be going over in camp and sharing some of these techniques and skills.
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.920]  So there's a few more we're waiting on, but I want to welcome to the show, we got Wooksauce
[01:39.920 --> 01:41.120]  Winery over there.
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.120]  How are you doing tonight, Flynn?
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.720]  How's it going?
[01:45.720 --> 01:46.720]  I'm good.
[01:46.720 --> 01:50.720]  Just got breaking from a wash.
[01:50.720 --> 01:54.920]  Alice is in the cold room, so we might pop over there and see what's going on.
[01:54.920 --> 01:55.920]  That's awesome.
[01:55.920 --> 01:56.920]  Yeah.
[01:56.920 --> 01:57.920]  Alice is going to be joining us here.
[01:57.920 --> 02:00.720]  I think we're going to pop into the washroom and bug her.
[02:00.720 --> 02:04.160]  Everybody thinks that people in the cannabis industry are lazy and we all just be living
[02:04.160 --> 02:06.920]  the good life because they only get to watch our Instagram reels.
[02:06.920 --> 02:10.440]  But I know everyone in this room tonight is a hard bunch of workers.
[02:10.440 --> 02:14.920]  I know everybody is taking time out of their busy schedules right now to bust some ass.
[02:15.120 --> 02:19.920]  I'm talking about Gil, so I really appreciate all you guys coming in here and making time
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.920]  for this.
[02:20.920 --> 02:21.920]  But it's by design.
[02:21.920 --> 02:22.920]  Gil's doing it by design.
[02:22.920 --> 02:29.280]  The rest of us are just slaves to the resin.
[02:29.280 --> 02:32.560]  I was actually packaging some stuff for your event, bro.
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.160]  So I'm going to take that little personal, dude.
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.640]  I just came down here just for you, dude.
[02:40.640 --> 02:42.320]  Put a hold on my work.
[02:42.320 --> 02:44.240]  But no, you're usually right, dude.
[02:44.400 --> 02:45.400]  You're usually right.
[02:45.400 --> 02:46.400]  You're right.
[02:46.400 --> 02:50.880]  Well, we appreciate that hard work even more because we know you're not a fan of it.
[02:50.880 --> 02:53.520]  So let's welcome Ganja Gil to the show.
[02:53.520 --> 02:54.520]  We love you.
[02:54.520 --> 02:55.520]  A humbled OG.
[02:55.520 --> 02:57.320]  Passion for the passion.
[02:57.320 --> 02:59.000]  We got Adam Lee Simpson.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.480]  Simply Adam over here.
[03:00.480 --> 03:02.920]  Coffee and Donuts Adam.
[03:02.920 --> 03:05.640]  Super stoked to have you with us tonight, my brother.
[03:05.640 --> 03:11.760]  We got the homie Kush Kirk from the Garden of Grease up there in Oregon.
[03:11.760 --> 03:14.680]  We have a really awesome lineup for tonight.
[03:14.680 --> 03:16.520]  A bunch of our friends.
[03:16.520 --> 03:18.040]  Tomorrow hopefully be joining me here.
[03:18.040 --> 03:21.880]  We're wrapping up the end of a long day getting ready for this camp.
[03:21.880 --> 03:25.920]  I want to pass the mic over to my friend Wooksauce over here, Flynn.
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.680]  And I think we'll start with you because that's how we're going to lay out the day.
[03:29.680 --> 03:32.080]  We've got Flynn and Alice.
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.080]  Wooksauce winery, fully melted.
[03:34.080 --> 03:35.080]  Girls and food.
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.640]  Going to be starting the day off with the ice water extraction washing demo because that's
[03:40.320 --> 03:43.080]  where a lot of this good hash starts for us.
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.080]  For a lot of us, melt is the goal.
[03:46.080 --> 03:51.640]  Flynn and Alice, you guys are amazing educators, hashishians.
[03:51.640 --> 03:53.680]  I've known you for a lot of years now, Flynn.
[03:53.680 --> 03:56.680]  We used to get to kick it a lot up in Humboldt.
[03:56.680 --> 03:58.600]  And I miss those times together, bro.
[03:58.600 --> 04:02.920]  I miss getting to smoke your hash on the daily.
[04:02.920 --> 04:05.320]  And man, I can't say enough good things about you guys.
[04:05.320 --> 04:07.240]  You guys won an Emerald Cup last year.
[04:07.360 --> 04:10.080]  You guys won the Ego Clash.
[04:10.080 --> 04:11.080]  You guys are the real deal.
[04:11.080 --> 04:14.680]  And I'm so excited to learn from you at camp, man.
[04:14.680 --> 04:22.080]  So tell me what we can expect this coming Saturday or Sunday at hash camp.
[04:22.080 --> 04:30.080]  Well, you can expect us to be doing some of this right here, actually.
[04:30.920 --> 04:32.920]  Sorry, you're ready for me.
[04:32.920 --> 04:34.920]  Wee!
[04:34.920 --> 04:38.580]  Yeah!
[04:38.580 --> 04:40.580]  There it is.
[04:40.580 --> 04:42.580]  This is how the hot dogs are made.
[04:42.580 --> 04:44.580]  Hi, your hand is on it.
[04:44.580 --> 04:46.580]  Ah!
[04:49.580 --> 04:50.580]  Beautiful, you guys.
[04:50.580 --> 04:52.580]  Yeah, show us what you're washing there.
[04:52.580 --> 04:53.580]  Hi, Alice.
[04:53.580 --> 04:54.580]  How are you this evening?
[04:54.580 --> 04:56.580]  Hi, friends.
[04:56.580 --> 04:57.580]  Love you all.
[04:57.580 --> 05:00.580]  Just casually making the best hash in the whole world.
[05:01.420 --> 05:04.420]  No, some good hash, definitely.
[05:06.420 --> 05:13.420]  Other than that, I think I'm pretty stoked to see what people are bringing questions-wise.
[05:13.420 --> 05:19.420]  And see how people are loving their first experiences growing and then washing the resin and stuff.
[05:19.420 --> 05:27.420]  I know you said you had a lot of previous students do their first hugel cultures last year and then grow their first plants.
[05:28.260 --> 05:32.260]  And making their first resin with it, which is pretty awesome.
[05:32.260 --> 05:34.260]  Yeah, that's super exciting, man.
[05:34.260 --> 05:36.260]  We have a student coming to camp.
[05:36.260 --> 05:41.260]  We actually did a live with him last night with a bunch of our past camp attendees.
[05:41.260 --> 05:43.260]  Talking about their success stories.
[05:43.260 --> 05:48.260]  And yeah, this guy went home, built a hugel, started making his own inputs, grew his first plants.
[05:48.260 --> 05:51.260]  And he's bringing his first hash to compete in the Students' Cup.
[05:51.260 --> 05:55.260]  And we're all going to get to judge it, all of you students.
[05:56.100 --> 06:03.100]  Welcome to the show, Tamara Thorne, Heal Thyself Gardens, co-host of all of our festivities this weekend.
[06:03.100 --> 06:05.100]  And she is also my hash teacher.
[06:05.100 --> 06:08.100]  She's a student of Kush Kirk.
[06:08.100 --> 06:10.100]  And I'm a student of hers.
[06:10.100 --> 06:16.100]  So I'm proud to carry on this legacy that Brandon and all the rest of you are carrying on.
[06:16.940 --> 06:19.940]  Yeah, it's an honor to be here with you guys tonight.
[06:19.940 --> 06:21.940]  I'm proud of you.
[06:21.940 --> 06:23.940]  Look at everyone.
[06:23.940 --> 06:25.940]  Aww.
[06:25.940 --> 06:27.940]  That was great.
[06:27.940 --> 06:32.940]  Yeah, so Flynn, you and Alice, you're going to wash some of our material this weekend.
[06:32.940 --> 06:36.940]  We're really excited about that because we don't have our washroom set up.
[06:36.940 --> 06:40.940]  We had to sell our freeze dryer when things got dire this summer.
[06:40.940 --> 06:42.940]  So we are rebuilding.
[06:43.780 --> 06:46.780]  So we've got some 24K we might have you wash.
[06:46.780 --> 06:50.780]  We've got one of Tamara's strains, which is actually a Kush Kirk Guava Punch cross.
[06:50.780 --> 06:59.780]  I also have the golden strawberry cross with lizard beads still from a couple of years ago I did.
[06:59.780 --> 07:02.780]  And that I've been waiting to wash for when the room was ready.
[07:02.780 --> 07:04.780]  Because I know that's going to be fire.
[07:04.780 --> 07:11.780]  And then I also have that same strain, with the ice cream cake GMO Mac we all fresh froze from this year.
[07:12.620 --> 07:13.620]  So I don't know.
[07:13.620 --> 07:16.620]  It's kind of hard to decide in the 24K.
[07:16.620 --> 07:18.620]  It's hard to pick.
[07:18.620 --> 07:20.620]  Yeah, we'll have to narrow it down.
[07:20.620 --> 07:22.620]  We're excited for this.
[07:22.620 --> 07:24.620]  This is amazing.
[07:24.620 --> 07:27.620]  So is that stuff full season stuff from Heal Thyself?
[07:27.620 --> 07:29.620]  Very interesting.
[07:29.620 --> 07:31.620]  That's right.
[07:31.620 --> 07:33.620]  Yeah.
[07:33.620 --> 07:38.620]  Flynn, why don't you tell us, I mean, what can we expect, man?
[07:39.460 --> 07:46.460]  You know, a lot of people that are at this thing have some, we've got some people coming who have never even seen hash being washed.
[07:46.460 --> 07:50.460]  You know, a lot of people that come to our events, some of them are experienced OGs.
[07:50.460 --> 07:52.460]  Some are getting into cannabis for the first time.
[07:52.460 --> 07:56.460]  We've got a student coming who, he just moved to California this year from Texas.
[07:56.460 --> 07:58.460]  Everything cannabis is new to him.
[07:58.460 --> 07:59.460]  He's got the bug.
[07:59.460 --> 08:01.460]  He's coming for hash camp.
[08:01.460 --> 08:05.460]  What are some of these youths going to take home with them?
[08:05.460 --> 08:08.460]  What are the tools that they're going to take home in that toolbox?
[08:09.300 --> 08:16.300]  Well, I feel like that's honestly where Alice shines a lot because we've taught some classes in Brazil and then Spain and stuff.
[08:16.300 --> 08:25.300]  And coming from that reality, like not everyone has access to a freeze dryer maybe or like this cold room and like this large investment into a setup.
[08:25.300 --> 08:36.300]  So it's very fun for me and her too to talk about just like different ways you can make really good hash with, you know, less intensive financial tools and not needing a freeze dryer.
[08:37.140 --> 08:47.140]  And just getting a frost free freezer or talking about different strategies, like literally maybe just using the resin dial to do like super small washes and then pressing that.
[08:47.140 --> 08:57.140]  And then making, you know, your little personal head stash like once a week, just like your little ritual for your two to three grams of hash for the week or whatever.
[08:57.980 --> 09:11.980]  So I don't know. I think that's part of the fun that I've learned, like going into more of the teaching side of things and stuff and just bringing like a lot of different strategies to empower people to make hash and not feel like,
[09:11.980 --> 09:15.980]  Oh, well, if I don't have a freeze dryer, why would I try to make hash?
[09:15.980 --> 09:19.980]  Or, oh, if I can't do fresh frozen, why would I try to make hash?
[09:19.980 --> 09:23.980]  Or, oh, if I can't wash in a cold room, why would I try to make hash?
[09:24.820 --> 09:28.820]  There's so many awesome ways to go about doing what we do.
[09:28.820 --> 09:34.820]  And it's nice to just like see people the light bulb turn on and be like, oh, I actually can do that myself at home.
[09:34.820 --> 09:36.820]  You know, I think that's really cool.
[09:36.820 --> 09:39.820]  Yeah, that's awesome, man.
[09:39.820 --> 09:40.820]  Yeah.
[09:40.820 --> 09:41.820]  I'm going to adapt it.
[09:41.820 --> 09:42.820]  You take it.
[09:42.820 --> 09:47.820]  Yeah, no, I like what you just said about having, you know, different ways for all these different things.
[09:47.820 --> 09:50.820]  And you can also, you know, low tech it totally.
[09:51.660 --> 09:54.660]  And it can be, you know, accessible for everyone.
[09:54.660 --> 10:02.660]  I think if you put the time and love in and you understand the principles that you're trying to do to achieve things,
[10:02.660 --> 10:12.660]  like you can make amazing top of the world quality competition quality hash with literally just a set of bags, a bucket, some ice,
[10:12.660 --> 10:17.660]  and, you know, somewhere to dry it, essentially, whatever method you choose to do that.
[10:18.500 --> 10:25.500]  So I think that's pretty one of the most amazing things about Solventless is it brings everyone super close to the plant.
[10:25.500 --> 10:31.500]  It's not like something that you wouldn't advise people to do at home for safety reasons or anything.
[10:31.500 --> 10:39.500]  And it really lets people kind of get more in tune with like the resin and what they're growing and their medicine and things like that.
[10:39.500 --> 10:46.500]  Because I feel like a lot of people really want to make hash, but it's just such a like daunting idea to them that they never even try it.
[10:47.340 --> 10:59.340]  And it's actually like super fun and easy if you understand, just like have a little bit of a basic knowledge or someone to tell you how to like empower yourself to like get it done in a way that works for you.
[11:02.340 --> 11:04.340]  Yeah, that's beautiful, brother.
[11:04.340 --> 11:05.340]  Yeah.
[11:05.340 --> 11:16.340]  So, hey, there's been a lot of talk lately and a real resurgence in drying your hash without a freeze dryer, a technique a lot of people don't know how to do, including me.
[11:17.180 --> 11:19.180]  I've never not used a freeze dryer.
[11:19.180 --> 11:23.180]  So what's your take on that quality wise?
[11:23.180 --> 11:31.180]  I mean, there's a lot of people we know how you feel about rosin boys and and certainly the freeze dryer is the tool of the rosin boy.
[11:32.180 --> 11:33.180]  You know, we love hash.
[11:33.180 --> 11:35.180]  We love it because it is a craft.
[11:35.180 --> 11:36.180]  It is an art form.
[11:36.180 --> 11:38.180]  You guys are working with your hands.
[11:38.180 --> 11:40.180]  You guys are really working with the plant.
[11:41.180 --> 11:43.180]  When you hand dry, I mean, air dry.
[11:43.180 --> 11:46.180]  There is there is a real craft there, man.
[11:47.020 --> 11:49.020]  What do you think about that?
[11:49.020 --> 11:51.020]  I mean, for me, I really enjoy air drying.
[11:51.020 --> 11:58.020]  It's just not something that sadly I get to partake in too much because I kind of do a lot of more like commercial level stuff.
[11:58.020 --> 12:01.020]  So I end up using the freeze dryer quite a bit.
[12:02.020 --> 12:12.020]  But like some of the most amazing resin I've seen this year is from a buddy of mine, Josh Dabbing Ninja, and he air dries everything.
[12:12.860 --> 12:16.860]  And it makes this really beautiful like caviar look to the resin.
[12:17.860 --> 12:21.860]  I think it's really interesting, like the different strategies that people use to air dry.
[12:21.860 --> 12:30.860]  It's one of those another one of those things that like there's so many ways to do it and it can all come out really well, just depending on like your understanding of things.
[12:30.860 --> 12:35.860]  I think Adam has a lot of experience air drying with like different methods and testing stuff like that.
[12:35.860 --> 12:37.860]  So I feel like he wants to jump in here and say something.
[12:38.860 --> 12:39.860]  I don't know if you can tell I'm chopping it a bit.
[12:39.860 --> 12:40.860]  I'm sorry.
[12:41.700 --> 12:47.700]  I'm thinking of so many different things, but I wish Todd was here because it just makes all of our talking, your talking makes me think of dry sift.
[12:48.700 --> 12:56.700]  And that is like one of the best things that you can do for, I mean, obviously it's very expensive because of how small yields it is.
[12:57.700 --> 13:00.700]  But if you don't have much and you know, you can order flat.
[13:01.700 --> 13:03.700]  Todd is great at talking about that.
[13:03.700 --> 13:08.700]  I've made dry sift maybe two or three times that I'd say I was proud of.
[13:09.540 --> 13:19.540]  But anyways, drying the plant before you work with it, that opens up the world a lot of for a lot of people to, you know, have a little bit easier time working with it.
[13:19.540 --> 13:22.540]  And then you could stay up until nighttime or wait until winter.
[13:23.540 --> 13:33.540]  But sorry, I also was thinking about how I just recently sieved a batch for the first time because I was inspired by Melton John, who is my protege.
[13:34.380 --> 13:42.380]  He is a really big fan of Melt and we actually hired him on to report for coffee and donuts.
[13:43.380 --> 13:45.380]  His first gig is Heal Thyself Gardens.
[13:46.380 --> 13:51.380]  I've convinced him to ride in my Prius because I told him I'm going to bring some Banana God Full Melt.
[13:52.380 --> 13:53.380]  So he's coming.
[13:54.380 --> 13:56.380]  But what was I going to say about Melton?
[13:58.380 --> 14:00.380]  Sorry, guys, I went off there for a little bit.
[14:01.220 --> 14:03.220]  Now you're muted and I'm just talking.
[14:04.220 --> 14:05.220]  Melton got you using the sieve.
[14:06.220 --> 14:07.220]  He got you sieving.
[14:08.220 --> 14:17.220]  Yeah, he got me sieving because he was giving me all this shit about how shredding up heads with a microplane, you know, and I just like really tore with just really over thought it a lot.
[14:18.220 --> 14:25.220]  And so I sieved for the first time, like real time, kept it cold the whole time while I was sieving it and really got it through.
[14:26.220 --> 14:28.220]  And it was just that resin that's kind of like that self-drying resin.
[14:29.060 --> 14:35.060]  It's almost, you know, there's no way there's no reason to to to shred up all the heads.
[14:36.060 --> 14:38.060]  So I agree with Melton.
[14:39.060 --> 14:40.060]  It was the best batch to sieve.
[14:41.060 --> 14:44.060]  So, you know, we did that and came out pretty good.
[14:45.060 --> 14:46.060]  That was the first Melton collab.
[14:47.060 --> 14:54.060]  I try to teach him some things, but I like to not teach him too much, you know, because I want him to keep I want him to be an unbiased reporter.
[14:55.060 --> 14:56.060]  I want him to learn from other people.
[14:56.900 --> 14:59.900]  And so, you know, not be so stuck in his ways.
[15:00.900 --> 15:01.900]  But I'll go stop going off on Melton.
[15:02.900 --> 15:03.900]  Sorry, guys.
[15:03.900 --> 15:05.900]  And then that's all I had to say about drying.
[15:06.900 --> 15:13.900]  Hey, we are super excited to have Adam and Melton John joining us at Hash Camp this weekend.
[15:14.900 --> 15:18.900]  Melton is going to be going around interviewing all of our teachers and our attendees.
[15:19.900 --> 15:23.900]  And I'm sure he's going to be asking some great questions because he is a newbie to the hash world, just like me.
[15:24.740 --> 15:26.740]  But he has some great questions.
[15:27.740 --> 15:28.740]  So we're excited to get some time with Melton.
[15:29.740 --> 15:31.740]  Hey, we've got a question here from our buddy, Sean, a wandering vagabond.
[15:32.740 --> 15:33.740]  He's up in the comments.
[15:34.740 --> 15:35.740]  He says he never used a freeze dryer.
[15:36.740 --> 15:37.740]  Refrigerator is his go to.
[15:38.740 --> 15:39.740]  Have you guys ever dried your hash in a refrigerator?
[15:40.740 --> 15:41.740]  Sean does live in his Prius.
[15:42.740 --> 15:43.740]  So take that into account.
[15:44.740 --> 15:46.740]  He cannot fit a freeze dryer in his car.
[15:47.740 --> 15:51.740]  He does have an amazing baking show on YouTube called Baked in a Prius.
[15:52.740 --> 15:53.740]  If anybody wants to check that out.
[15:54.740 --> 15:55.740]  It's really impressive.
[15:56.740 --> 15:57.740]  Who's used a refrigerator to dry their hash?
[15:58.740 --> 16:02.740]  I definitely think it's a great option if you don't have a freeze dryer.
[16:03.740 --> 16:05.740]  A frost free freezer is actually a great option too.
[16:06.740 --> 16:08.740]  Because a refrigerator, you're going to get a little more oxidation.
[16:09.740 --> 16:12.740]  You might dry it out a little quicker because it's warmer, essentially.
[16:13.740 --> 16:21.740]  But with the frost free freezer, you can do like really like white looking freeze dryer hash.
[16:22.580 --> 16:24.580]  And really lower the oxidation levels of stuff.
[16:25.580 --> 16:26.580]  Especially if you're working with like fresh frozen.
[16:27.580 --> 16:28.580]  If you're doing like dry material or something.
[16:29.580 --> 16:30.580]  Or trim or something that's already experienced.
[16:31.580 --> 16:34.580]  Like a refrigerator for a long period of time.
[16:35.580 --> 16:37.580]  That may be a better strategy and stuff.
[16:38.580 --> 16:41.580]  But it's nice if you want to do dry hash but don't want to buy a freeze dryer.
[16:42.580 --> 16:43.580]  You can get a frost free freezer.
[16:44.580 --> 16:45.580]  And just put hash in there.
[16:46.580 --> 16:47.580]  Like don't put food if you can and stuff.
[16:48.580 --> 16:49.580]  If that's possible, you know.
[16:50.580 --> 16:51.580]  So just as hash.
[16:52.580 --> 16:54.580]  It's really clean and it actually dries hash pretty well, I think.
[16:55.580 --> 16:56.580]  You know.
[16:57.580 --> 16:58.580]  Awesome.
[17:01.230 --> 17:04.230]  The frost free freezers are just, yeah.
[17:05.230 --> 17:06.230]  You're so right.
[17:07.230 --> 17:08.230]  I want to welcome Jay Peters to the show.
[17:09.230 --> 17:10.230]  Arrow Solvent List.
[17:11.230 --> 17:12.230]  Hey Jay.
[17:13.230 --> 17:14.230]  Heyo.
[17:15.230 --> 17:16.230]  Jay is an awesome farmer and hash maker up at Humboldt.
[17:17.230 --> 17:22.230]  Jay joined us to teach at our last regen camp at Hoogleville last April up at Humboldt.
[17:23.070 --> 17:24.070]  Along with his partner Jess.
[17:25.070 --> 17:28.070]  And he's going to be teaching at Hash Camp and Regen Camp with us this coming weekend.
[17:29.070 --> 17:31.070]  Jay is Arrow Solvent List, his own brand.
[17:32.070 --> 17:34.070]  And he works with Flynn up at Fully Melted up at Humboldt.
[17:35.070 --> 17:36.070]  The fucking guy.
[17:37.070 --> 17:38.070]  Honored to have you here, brother.
[17:39.070 --> 17:40.070]  Yep.
[17:41.070 --> 17:42.070]  And we'll be talking with you a little later.
[17:43.070 --> 17:46.070]  Jay, you ever use anything other than a freeze dryer to dry your hash?
[17:47.070 --> 17:48.070]  Oh God, yeah.
[17:48.910 --> 17:53.910]  I used to microplane onto parchment in a bunch of stacked up pizza boxes.
[17:54.910 --> 17:57.910]  I tried drying in different freezers.
[17:58.910 --> 18:00.910]  Like just normal freezers.
[18:01.910 --> 18:05.910]  I used to sieve instead of microplane onto parchment.
[18:06.910 --> 18:08.910]  Super thin on like a baking rack.
[18:11.910 --> 18:16.910]  When I very, very first started, I was like, oh my God, I'm going to be a chef.
[18:17.750 --> 18:25.750]  When I very, very first started, I used to take my chunk of hash and I would turn a box fan upside down so that it was blowing down.
[18:26.750 --> 18:34.750]  And I would put a 25 screen on the back of the fan and I would just put my hash on top of that 25 screen so the air was like pulling through it.
[18:35.750 --> 18:37.750]  And yeah, I thought I was killing the game.
[18:38.750 --> 18:40.750]  I was like, man, this just dried in like 18 hours.
[18:41.590 --> 18:42.590]  That's awesome.
[18:43.590 --> 19:03.590]  I mean, honestly, though, if we're being super real, like I miss consuming and I miss a lot of things about air dried hash, but I do not at all miss microplaning or dealing with sticky sieves.
[19:04.590 --> 19:05.590]  I don't miss any of that.
[19:06.430 --> 19:19.430]  But when I see other people's really like prime, super well air dried hash, it definitely makes me feel like I'm like missing a homie or something.
[19:20.430 --> 19:23.430]  I totally feel you on that.
[19:24.430 --> 19:28.430]  I prefer like I'm about to smoke this cured resin hash.
[19:29.430 --> 19:30.430]  I prefer that air dry.
[19:31.430 --> 19:32.430]  It's a lot of freaking work.
[19:33.430 --> 19:34.430]  It is so much work as we all know.
[19:35.270 --> 19:36.270]  The microplaning forever.
[19:37.270 --> 19:38.270]  Wow.
[19:39.270 --> 19:40.270]  It is so good.
[19:41.270 --> 19:42.270]  It's definitely my preferred method.
[19:43.270 --> 19:49.270]  But I mean, Brandon's air dry is every time I've seen him put up his air dry.
[19:50.270 --> 19:52.270]  It's like, yeah, you slay homie.
[19:55.270 --> 19:56.270]  Much respect to the brother.
[19:57.270 --> 19:58.270]  Yeah.
[19:58.270 --> 20:01.270]  When I met Tamara, her shop was full of pizza boxes.
[20:02.270 --> 20:03.270]  That's how I knew she was the real deal.
[20:04.110 --> 20:06.110]  And that's how I knew she was a student at Kush Kirk.
[20:07.110 --> 20:10.110]  Because the only other garage I've seen that looked like that was Kush Kirk's.
[20:11.110 --> 20:16.110]  I thought this guy's either good or he's got the best hash in the area.
[20:17.110 --> 20:20.110]  Let's talk with you, my brother, Brandon Kush Kirk.
[20:21.110 --> 20:22.110]  You are the man.
[20:22.110 --> 20:23.110]  We love you.
[20:24.110 --> 20:28.110]  We did a fun live with you last week where you walked Tamara through some hand rolling some charas.
[20:29.110 --> 20:31.110]  That was a lot of fun, man.
[20:31.950 --> 20:33.950]  And like we said, Tamara is a student of yours.
[20:34.950 --> 20:35.950]  We both look up to you a lot.
[20:36.950 --> 20:37.950]  The way you farm, the way you run your farm up there.
[20:38.950 --> 20:40.950]  We're just super inspired by the work you do, brother.
[20:41.950 --> 20:42.950]  And it's reflected in your hash.
[20:43.950 --> 20:46.950]  We all know you don't count good resin unless you've got good plants.
[20:47.950 --> 20:48.950]  And you don't have good plants unless you've got good soil.
[20:49.950 --> 20:53.950]  And you spent a lot of time with those hands in the soil and building that soil.
[20:54.950 --> 20:55.950]  Man, we love you, bro.
[20:56.950 --> 20:58.950]  So tell us what you got cooking up for us for Hash Camp.
[20:59.790 --> 21:00.790]  I know you always come with lots of special stuff.
[21:01.790 --> 21:04.790]  And I know you and Tamara got a really special afternoon planned for us.
[21:05.790 --> 21:09.790]  Yeah, we're going to do some temple ball rolling.
[21:10.790 --> 21:11.790]  That's going to be the highlight of it all, really.
[21:12.790 --> 21:19.790]  Yeah, we got some hash to show you how to take from a powdered form or just the dried form of hash.
[21:20.790 --> 21:22.790]  And kind of turn it into the ball form and kind of keep it like that.
[21:23.790 --> 21:25.790]  And talk about the importance of that.
[21:26.630 --> 21:28.630]  And kind of hold that tradition.
[21:29.630 --> 21:31.630]  That kind of was Frenchie's thing.
[21:32.630 --> 21:38.630]  And that's what I've been feeling more in the heart lately so much is this calling for that traditional hash.
[21:39.630 --> 21:41.630]  And I've just been enjoying it myself lately.
[21:42.630 --> 21:44.630]  It makes me feel so much more nourished.
[21:45.630 --> 21:49.630]  So I've just been noticing that and want to give thanks for that.
[21:50.630 --> 21:52.630]  That's what really I think we're going to be talking about.
[21:53.470 --> 21:58.470]  Is really just kind of holding space for this time in the past that we need to not forget about.
[21:59.470 --> 22:01.470]  And that's going to be important.
[22:02.470 --> 22:03.470]  So we're going to do that.
[22:04.470 --> 22:06.470]  Hold some space for that moment and talk about the history a little bit.
[22:07.470 --> 22:10.470]  And then just go into kind of how to roll the balls, the SOPs on that.
[22:11.470 --> 22:15.470]  And then also enjoy the balls as well too.
[22:16.470 --> 22:17.470]  Yeah, we're going to do a little smoke out.
[22:18.470 --> 22:20.470]  I thought I'd bring out Frenchie's hookah or my hookah now.
[22:21.310 --> 22:24.310]  But you know, it's just like the style and the quasar and all.
[22:25.310 --> 22:27.310]  So I'm going to bring it and pack it up for everyone.
[22:28.310 --> 22:34.310]  And really make that experience live on, man.
[22:35.310 --> 22:36.310]  I'm telling you.
[22:37.310 --> 22:39.310]  I've told you Joey, but I mean from everyone there.
[22:40.310 --> 22:43.310]  And Adam saw it last weekend or two weekends ago, whenever it was.
[22:44.310 --> 22:49.310]  It's an experience, let alone when you break out that hookah and people are questioning it.
[22:50.150 --> 22:52.150]  And then they see what goes through.
[22:53.150 --> 22:55.150]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[22:56.150 --> 22:57.150]  It really hits super good.
[22:58.150 --> 23:01.150]  And of course it's like a lot of hash in there.
[23:02.150 --> 23:05.150]  You're going to be like, oh, you can't really do that alone and regular.
[23:06.150 --> 23:07.150]  But you honestly, I guess you could.
[23:08.150 --> 23:09.150]  It lasts very long.
[23:10.150 --> 23:12.150]  I mean, like it's something that you could like take all day, you know.
[23:13.150 --> 23:18.150]  But nonetheless, it's the experience that I had from it that I noticed that Frenchie had from it.
[23:18.990 --> 23:23.990]  So it's just really cool that I can put myself in his shoes, I guess you can really say.
[23:24.990 --> 23:25.990]  And like feel that.
[23:26.990 --> 23:27.990]  So I want to give thanks for that always, man.
[23:28.990 --> 23:32.990]  And being a student of his, you know, was one of the best things that I've ever done for myself.
[23:33.990 --> 23:35.990]  And, you know, ever had an opportunity to do.
[23:36.990 --> 23:41.990]  And so, yeah, we just want to really hang out with that moment and enjoy that.
[23:42.990 --> 23:46.990]  I'm stuck on it all the time because it's like the hash is so fulfilling.
[23:47.830 --> 23:50.830]  When it's really, you know, the full body hash, you know.
[23:51.830 --> 23:52.830]  The rosin just doesn't cut it.
[23:53.830 --> 23:54.830]  And that's what it was lately, too.
[23:55.830 --> 23:59.830]  It's like, you know, we've been testing out a lot of stuff here, you know, with all the phenos and this and that.
[24:00.830 --> 24:04.830]  And like the if it's not six star, you know, it usually gets pressed in the rosin.
[24:05.830 --> 24:10.830]  So with these phenos not always making six star, it's a lot more rosin.
[24:11.830 --> 24:13.830]  And, you know, that's what the market calls for, too.
[24:14.830 --> 24:15.830]  So that's OK in a sense.
[24:16.670 --> 24:23.670]  When I'm taste testing everything and then I hit my hash, when I actually choose something I want to smoke and not be like working, it's really noticeable.
[24:24.670 --> 24:25.670]  The hash just is so much better.
[24:26.670 --> 24:28.670]  So, yeah. Cheers to hash, right?
[24:29.670 --> 24:30.670]  We're all hash lovers. I feel like way more.
[24:31.670 --> 24:34.670]  So cheers to hash.
[24:35.670 --> 24:39.670]  I mean, like the full body, the full spectrum right here.
[24:40.670 --> 24:41.670]  Yeah.
[24:42.510 --> 24:44.510]  Yeah. Thank you for saying that, Brandon.
[24:45.510 --> 24:46.510]  And thank you for mentioning Frenchy.
[24:47.510 --> 24:51.510]  You know, he was a friend to many of us, a mentor and a teacher to a lot of us.
[24:52.510 --> 24:56.510]  And I know that Alice worked really closely with him and so many of us did.
[24:57.510 --> 25:02.510]  And and the legacy all you guys are carrying on, the work you guys are carrying on is carrying on Frenchy's spirit.
[25:03.510 --> 25:06.510]  And I just admire all you guys for, you know, walking that path.
[25:07.510 --> 25:09.510]  You guys are making him proud up there in hash heaven.
[25:10.350 --> 25:16.350]  And Brandon, what you're doing with that hookah, bringing that around to events and giving people that experience is so special.
[25:17.350 --> 25:19.350]  You know, Frenchy really loved to do that.
[25:20.350 --> 25:22.350]  Yeah, it's the most important thing.
[25:23.350 --> 25:31.350]  Like, even if I couldn't say a word and teach anybody anything, it's like almost just being there with the hookah is more important because it's bringing people together.
[25:32.350 --> 25:35.350]  This is how I met a lot of French and this is the craziest part.
[25:36.350 --> 25:37.350]  I think that's where I met him.
[25:38.190 --> 25:42.190]  I think that's where I met Alice, if I'm not wrong.
[25:43.190 --> 25:45.190]  I want to double check that later.
[25:46.190 --> 25:49.190]  You can ask her, Flynn, because my memory is gray.
[25:50.190 --> 25:53.190]  I know I met like some other Brazilian hookah there, but it's like just the vibe.
[25:54.190 --> 25:56.190]  Yeah, it's the vibe. So cheers to the vibe.
[25:59.190 --> 26:04.190]  Do you all mind if I say something really quick on the drying of hash?
[26:05.030 --> 26:06.030]  I don't forget.
[26:07.030 --> 26:16.030]  I just wanted to say that even though it seems like maybe I hate on the freeze dryer or a lot of people just assume that I just don't like it or something.
[26:17.030 --> 26:20.030]  I like to make both and I am thankful for the freeze dryer.
[26:21.030 --> 26:23.030]  I think it's badass and it's pretty awesome.
[26:23.870 --> 26:32.870]  I also think it is actually energy efficient and definitely something that might not seem affordable.
[26:33.870 --> 26:41.870]  But you got to keep in mind there are people that have whole businesses on freeze dryers, at home freeze dryers where they're sending out dehydrated fruit and all these things.
[26:42.870 --> 26:45.870]  I've bought that a lot.
[26:46.870 --> 26:49.870]  So anyways, it's totally doable to buy one on a budget.
[26:50.870 --> 26:51.870]  You just got to do it right.
[26:52.710 --> 26:53.710]  And if you do that, then it lightens your load.
[26:54.710 --> 26:56.710]  If you want to air dry, you don't have to air dry as much.
[26:57.710 --> 27:00.710]  But you can still have the best of both worlds and that's what I just wanted to touch on that for a second.
[27:01.710 --> 27:02.710]  We can move on.
[27:03.710 --> 27:07.710]  I was just going to say, I'll tell you guys a funny story about Alice.
[27:08.710 --> 27:10.710]  She was all about the air drying, right?
[27:11.710 --> 27:13.710]  She loves it. She was so about it.
[27:14.710 --> 27:21.710]  And then Adam did the flight with a blind comparison of freeze dryer and air dry.
[27:22.710 --> 27:27.710]  And literally every single one on a blind test, she preferred the freeze dried hash.
[27:28.710 --> 27:29.710]  It was so funny.
[27:30.710 --> 27:33.710]  She almost got frustrated that she chose the freeze dried hash every time.
[27:34.710 --> 27:44.710]  It was so funny because I was like, dude, honestly, I do love air drying, but it is like, it's one of those things that is, it's very hard to do.
[27:45.550 --> 27:59.550]  So when you're doing like work all the time and stuff and you don't maybe have the time to put in that specific batch, you know, like it is a, it is a labor of love and you need to pay a lot of attention.
[28:00.550 --> 28:03.550]  And when you're doing a lot of the times when you do what we do, you do so much stuff.
[28:04.550 --> 28:09.550]  It's very hard to be that present for one process.
[28:10.390 --> 28:20.390]  Hey, I'm so glad you brought up Adam's tasting flights because I was just thinking of that when he was saying that and we got to enjoy one last year and it was so good.
[28:21.390 --> 28:23.390]  And I did the blind test as well.
[28:24.390 --> 28:25.390]  And my results were all over the map.
[28:26.390 --> 28:29.390]  I was really surprised how much of the freeze dried I liked.
[28:30.390 --> 28:32.390]  I thought I was cool like Alice also.
[28:33.390 --> 28:35.390]  And I was surprised how much of the freeze dried I liked.
[28:36.230 --> 28:39.230]  But that was an awesome way to offer your, your, your hash.
[28:40.230 --> 28:41.230]  Yeah, really cool, man.
[28:42.230 --> 28:48.230]  I did like in the cure, like one, but yeah, that was super cool.
[28:49.230 --> 28:51.230]  It was a rad way to be able to show that.
[28:52.230 --> 28:53.230]  Thanks, y'all.
[28:54.230 --> 28:55.230]  Appreciate that.
[28:56.230 --> 28:57.230]  Change it up.
[28:58.070 --> 29:11.070]  I didn't really do flights this year, but I did make air dried and freeze dried of both, both batches just because sometimes when it's just so good in the 90 micron or something or the 120 micron like this year was the year of the 120 micron.
[29:12.070 --> 29:13.070]  I felt like it was just super great.
[29:14.070 --> 29:15.070]  And I felt like the air.
[29:16.070 --> 29:19.070]  Sorry, the wind was pretty like low.
[29:20.070 --> 29:26.070]  So I felt like the resin was that much cleaner because of the dust, like lack of windy dust in the plants and stuff.
[29:26.910 --> 29:36.910]  But so year of 120 and anyways, I like to split the batch in half right then and there when it's wicking or when it's still cold in the little pool of water in the sea in the bag in the bag.
[29:37.910 --> 29:50.910]  And then I will either prep that for microplaning like little dollops so that they dry evenly and then I can get them out of the freezer one by one or on that stuff that I was saying was just like clearly self drying.
[29:51.750 --> 30:02.750]  Then I'm going to try to see that nowadays because I think that, yeah, people are mostly right that these trichomes hold all their secondary metabolites inside like a little bottle, like a corked bottle.
[30:03.750 --> 30:07.750]  And shouldn't be shouldn't be breaking those bottles all over the place.
[30:08.750 --> 30:09.750]  Some of them aren't broken though.
[30:10.750 --> 30:19.750]  That's why I still like the microplane and there's some things that are so oily and just so rich in oil that it's it's it would be impossible to put through a sieve and that you should either freeze dry properly.
[30:20.590 --> 30:24.590]  Or you should try to microplane if you want to and no pressure.
[30:25.590 --> 30:26.590]  I don't want to I'm not.
[30:27.590 --> 30:40.590]  Or, you know, so anyways, but some of the best hash that I've ever smoked is has been from air dried microplane specifically from stuff that's so high in oil that it would be impossible to try to see that.
[30:41.430 --> 30:43.430]  I know Brandon has experience with that.
[30:43.430 --> 30:52.430]  Like he with intention is is picking certain things that he's going to put through a sieve because he knows that, you know, he kind of knows what the end result is going to be like from past from experiential.
[30:54.430 --> 30:55.430]  Understanding. Correct.
[30:56.430 --> 30:58.430]  Brandon, let's hear it.
[30:59.430 --> 31:00.430]  Spill the beans.
[31:01.430 --> 31:02.430]  Let's hear it.
[31:03.270 --> 31:04.270]  Now that's completely right.
[31:05.270 --> 31:06.270]  I mean, it is.
[31:06.270 --> 31:08.270]  You just got to know what it is beforehand.
[31:08.270 --> 31:13.270]  So you're not like having an anxiety attack and losing all the hash stick into everything, you know?
[31:14.270 --> 31:17.270]  Like it's just it's just that's what it is.
[31:17.270 --> 31:23.270]  I mean, that's why I thank God for the freeze dryer, because I know that's, you know, it helped a lot in those cases.
[31:24.270 --> 31:27.270]  Like, yeah, it'd just be a nightmare if I didn't have that sometimes.
[31:28.110 --> 31:32.110]  So that's like one side of it, you know, where the free shower works in our favor.
[31:33.110 --> 31:37.110]  And then I was going to say when you were saying before, Adam, when you cut in, it was space saving, too.
[31:38.110 --> 31:39.110]  It's like save so much space.
[31:40.110 --> 31:47.110]  I mean, how can I get pretty much like I don't know, like you could fill up the machine a lot, you know, like seven trays or whatever.
[31:48.110 --> 31:51.110]  And those seven trays, I mean, it could be around a kilo or something.
[31:51.950 --> 32:02.950]  But it's like if I were to think about that in pizza boxes, that's so many pizza boxes because I'm usually doing three to five grams, three or four grams in a pizza box.
[32:03.950 --> 32:10.950]  It's like the average spread I do with the sieve when it comes down to like you got to, you know, if you do it, this is the correct way to do it.
[32:11.950 --> 32:14.950]  You don't want to overload and do too much because it doesn't dry evenly.
[32:15.790 --> 32:20.790]  So three to five grams is always what I found to be like on a pizza box size, the correct amount.
[32:21.790 --> 32:23.790]  But that would be like so many pizza boxes.
[32:24.790 --> 32:25.790]  Like, that's like crazy to think about.
[32:26.790 --> 32:28.790]  But yeah, and then that's like batch sizes and stuff, too.
[32:29.790 --> 32:34.790]  I mean, like I'm not really running greenhouses of just all the same flavor.
[32:35.790 --> 32:39.790]  So it's like a lot of the Finos have to be separated and done individually.
[32:40.790 --> 32:41.790]  So that makes it all small batch.
[32:42.630 --> 32:47.630]  And that's like something in the moment you can kind of tell as like you're kind of scooping it out.
[32:48.630 --> 32:55.630]  I kind of Adam said he splits it right in that moment, right when he's scooping it out of the bag and chooses whether it's going to be hand dried or freeze dried.
[32:56.630 --> 32:57.630]  And that's that moment, you know.
[32:58.630 --> 32:59.630]  Yeah.
[32:59.630 --> 33:05.630]  And it's kind of hard to tell, but, you know, in the in the past, like sometimes you can tell on the plant, but it's not always a guarantee.
[33:06.630 --> 33:09.630]  So it's got to go to that final step and go through it.
[33:10.470 --> 33:14.470]  And then strain wise, I mean, I've seen strains even do different results now.
[33:15.470 --> 33:25.470]  I've grown the same one multiple years in a row in different locations around the valley or even different locations in my backyard and seen it kind of react differently.
[33:26.470 --> 33:29.470]  So it's been stickier some years, some years it's been sandier.
[33:30.470 --> 33:36.470]  So in both years, it still dumps, you know, a good amount of hash, but the texture is a little bit different sometimes.
[33:37.310 --> 33:47.310]  So it's really kind of crazy to say, you know, sometimes when you find the right one, too, it's like you got to almost run it a couple of times and try it out.
[33:48.310 --> 33:49.310]  Makes it a real guarantee.
[33:52.610 --> 33:54.610]  I want to get your guys thoughts on this.
[33:55.610 --> 34:00.610]  You know, this this hash industry can be very one single track mind for a long time.
[34:01.610 --> 34:08.610]  It was BHO and then it was carts and then it was, you know, we're in a heavy rosin time right now in our hash industry.
[34:09.610 --> 34:13.610]  Real hashicians like you guys, like all kinds of hash.
[34:14.610 --> 34:16.610]  That's why we're teaching temple balls at camp.
[34:17.610 --> 34:19.610]  That's why we've got Todd coming in to teach dry sift.
[34:20.610 --> 34:26.610]  You know, we're all about all types of resin and all types of this, you know, these historic and ancient techniques.
[34:27.610 --> 34:30.610]  That's why we were hand rolling charas with you the other day, Brandon.
[34:31.610 --> 34:38.610]  And you were talking about when you go to those events and you get to give people that Frenchy like experience with the ancient hash and these ancient ways of smoking.
[34:39.610 --> 34:41.610]  How deeply that touches people.
[34:42.610 --> 34:47.610]  At our recent sesh, we saw Todd had some temple balls that he was had on the table.
[34:48.610 --> 34:53.610]  We saw Jay, you've been doing these incredible temple balls wrapped in flower petals, which we want to talk to you about.
[34:54.610 --> 35:03.610]  Do you guys think we're going to start to see more commercial market for these different types of hash or the rosin boy is just going to be ruling the day for a moment?
[35:04.450 --> 35:09.450]  Until the next, until some somebody starts rapping about the next hot thing.
[35:10.450 --> 35:12.450]  I mean, I want your guys take on that. Jump in.
[35:13.450 --> 35:15.450]  Nah, dude, hash is coming back for surely.
[35:16.450 --> 35:19.450]  Like rosin's forever going to have its place now that it's here.
[35:20.450 --> 35:22.450]  But like dude, hash has been here the whole fucking time.
[35:23.450 --> 35:26.450]  And we have a super young hash culture in North America.
[35:27.450 --> 35:29.450]  Really like that shit's coming back around, dude.
[35:30.450 --> 35:32.450]  More and more people all the time are getting turned on.
[35:33.290 --> 35:39.290]  And once you start taking into it and you see where that goes, like historically wise,
[35:40.290 --> 35:46.290]  and you actually start consuming hash on a serious level or whatever,
[35:47.290 --> 35:51.290]  it's a noticeable, noticeable, noticeable difference for sure.
[35:52.290 --> 35:53.290]  And people like that.
[35:54.290 --> 36:01.290]  When you say bubble hash, 90% of the time what comes to people's mind is dark, sticky,
[36:02.130 --> 36:04.130]  kind of stretchy, like old school bubble.
[36:05.130 --> 36:10.130]  And there's a reason for that because like historically it's fire.
[36:17.170 --> 36:23.170]  Jay, tell us about these temple balls you're making with the flower petals on them.
[36:24.170 --> 36:26.170]  And what do you notice and does it affect the curing process?
[36:27.170 --> 36:29.170]  You smoke it with that on there? Give us the lowdown on these.
[36:30.170 --> 36:32.170]  Everybody should go to Aerosolventless Instagram
[36:33.010 --> 36:35.010]  and you can see the pictures of these beautiful temple balls.
[36:36.010 --> 36:38.010]  It's like nothing I've ever seen. It's like a work of art. I want to eat them.
[36:39.010 --> 36:41.010]  And what kind of flower?
[36:42.010 --> 36:48.010]  So I did some dried rose petals of different varieties.
[36:49.010 --> 36:55.010]  I did some dried jasmine, whole jasmine petals, dried,
[36:56.010 --> 37:00.010]  and then wrapped around hash, and then the rose petal on the outside of the jasmine.
[37:00.850 --> 37:03.850]  But I don't know. I'm just really playing with it, honestly.
[37:04.850 --> 37:08.850]  It just kind of came to me one day when I was messing with some hash,
[37:09.850 --> 37:11.850]  and I was like, damn, this would be pretty cool.
[37:12.850 --> 37:17.850]  And then I actually started really doing it, and I was like, oh shit, I think this is really cool.
[37:18.850 --> 37:27.850]  But yeah, that one's a wedding cake with just roses were on that one.
[37:28.690 --> 37:30.690]  That was a pretty young one.
[37:31.690 --> 37:35.690]  I just cut it open so everybody could see the texture of it and the contrast change.
[37:36.690 --> 37:38.690]  But it's definitely changing up the curing process.
[37:39.690 --> 37:45.690]  Anytime I tie up my temple balls, you'll always see some leakage
[37:46.690 --> 37:50.690]  into the wrinkles of the plastic where it actually meets the sphere.
[37:51.690 --> 37:56.690]  But this was like big juice happening in these tie-ups.
[37:57.530 --> 38:01.530]  And if you're patient and you can wait it out,
[38:02.530 --> 38:07.530]  I couldn't. Somebody else had one of mine that was like five months old or something
[38:08.530 --> 38:13.530]  when they opened it, and it was just... I was blown away.
[38:14.530 --> 38:16.530]  It was so crazy inside that thing.
[38:17.530 --> 38:20.530]  And you do smoke it with the petal on it,
[38:21.530 --> 38:24.530]  and especially with the jasmine petals, when those are dried,
[38:25.370 --> 38:29.370]  and I dry them flat in between parchment, just in heavy books,
[38:30.370 --> 38:34.370]  when that hash is warmed up from you rolling those temple balls,
[38:35.370 --> 38:39.370]  it just eats the jasmine petal.
[38:40.370 --> 38:42.370]  The jasmine petal gets pulled into the temple ball
[38:43.370 --> 38:47.370]  to where it looks flush with the hash itself.
[38:48.370 --> 38:53.370]  It's pretty wild, but the jasmine after five months was just like...
[38:54.210 --> 38:57.210]  You couldn't even find it in the hash anymore.
[38:58.210 --> 39:03.210]  The hash ate it. It was pretty crazy.
[39:04.210 --> 39:07.210]  Oh, yeah, and I did some poppy petal ones.
[39:08.210 --> 39:11.210]  But yeah, those things are pretty cool.
[39:12.210 --> 39:16.210]  That's so cool, Jay. Yeah, we can't wait to check those out in person.
[39:17.210 --> 39:20.210]  Brandon, I know you've done a lot of this, this fermentation,
[39:21.050 --> 39:24.050]  this letting temple balls sit around a long time.
[39:25.050 --> 39:27.050]  Have you even buried some in the ground?
[39:28.050 --> 39:30.050]  Is that what you told me you've done?
[39:31.050 --> 39:34.050]  Yeah, I buried some right now, and it's probably been a year.
[39:35.050 --> 39:38.050]  They came from material that might have been a year,
[39:39.050 --> 39:42.050]  but it doesn't activate until you press it, the decarb,
[39:43.050 --> 39:45.050]  when that happens, because I took it out of the freezer.
[39:46.050 --> 39:49.050]  So it was in the freezer before. So it's only been a year right now.
[39:49.890 --> 39:53.890]  Wait a second. What are you talking about?
[39:54.890 --> 39:56.890]  Are you fermenting? Are you drinking this?
[39:57.890 --> 39:59.890]  It's Ganja Guild that's making me laugh.
[40:00.890 --> 40:03.890]  He's smiling the whole time, and I'm sorry.
[40:04.890 --> 40:07.890]  What is this? Are you drinking it? What do you mean fermenting?
[40:08.890 --> 40:11.890]  You mean for like fertile? Then you're going to use it on your garden?
[40:12.890 --> 40:15.890]  No, no, no, no. It's just like aging the hash.
[40:16.730 --> 40:22.730]  I guess you meant like, Joey meant aging.
[40:23.730 --> 40:26.730]  Yeah, I meant more of a curing process than fermenting.
[40:27.730 --> 40:31.730]  But I'm sure there is some of that taking place.
[40:32.730 --> 40:34.730]  Talk to me about that a little bit.
[40:35.730 --> 40:38.730]  What's happening when they bury that hash inside of a goat's intestine?
[40:39.730 --> 40:41.730]  I would think there's some fermentation taking place in that.
[40:42.570 --> 40:47.570]  You've got all these literal gut microbes from the animal still very present, I would think.
[40:48.570 --> 40:52.570]  So yeah, how do we make better hash? Do we need to stuff it inside our goats or what?
[40:53.570 --> 40:56.570]  Melton John knows all about that, if you haven't asked him already.
[40:57.570 --> 41:00.570]  Well, actually, I don't think Melton John knows much,
[41:01.570 --> 41:03.570]  because even Simply Adam doesn't know very much about this one.
[41:04.570 --> 41:09.570]  But Melton's my protege, so I don't teach him certain things, though.
[41:10.410 --> 41:13.410]  But I had a freezer go out on me.
[41:14.410 --> 41:17.410]  This conversation is making me think of it, because actually,
[41:18.410 --> 41:21.410]  the nice lady that I work with, the freezer went out,
[41:22.410 --> 41:26.410]  and she didn't know until, obviously, it was too late.
[41:27.410 --> 41:30.410]  And when we opened it, it smelled like ferment.
[41:31.410 --> 41:32.410]  Like it was starting to ferment.
[41:33.410 --> 41:35.410]  And that all went back into the garden bed.
[41:36.250 --> 41:37.250]  I thought that was interesting.
[41:38.250 --> 41:41.250]  There's alcohols in there, there's stuff in there.
[41:42.250 --> 41:43.250]  Maybe it is fermenting.
[41:44.250 --> 41:47.250]  No, we're talking about the high lady.
[41:48.250 --> 41:51.250]  When you decarve the hash, and the cannabinoids start changing.
[41:52.250 --> 41:56.250]  So the THC turns into more of the CBN, CBG, CBDs,
[41:57.250 --> 41:58.250]  and all the other micro cannabinoids.
[41:59.250 --> 42:03.250]  They start raising, they start going up with potency.
[42:04.090 --> 42:06.090]  When the aging process starts.
[42:07.090 --> 42:09.090]  So that's kind of what he was meaning.
[42:10.090 --> 42:11.090]  And then that right there is like,
[42:12.090 --> 42:15.090]  what we're going to talk about too, this weekend,
[42:16.090 --> 42:19.090]  is that level to unlocking that.
[42:20.090 --> 42:23.090]  It really has to be decarved to be unlocked,
[42:24.090 --> 42:27.090]  and then we're aging it, so it actually goes higher over time.
[42:28.090 --> 42:29.090]  And I don't know if there's a shelf life on this time.
[42:30.090 --> 42:31.090]  We were just kind of talking about this.
[42:31.930 --> 42:34.930]  And not knowing how long it could be buried.
[42:35.930 --> 42:36.930]  When does it start changing for the worse?
[42:37.930 --> 42:43.930]  And also the little amount of THC that's still inside it
[42:44.930 --> 42:46.930]  is being protected by the crust of that temple ball.
[42:47.930 --> 42:51.930]  Which I actually read about in a plant journal,
[42:52.930 --> 42:59.930]  where these scientists had pressed hash
[43:00.770 --> 43:01.770]  that they got from people,
[43:02.770 --> 43:06.770]  the smugglers got in trouble with whoever.
[43:07.770 --> 43:09.770]  And they got these from the authorities, these samples.
[43:10.770 --> 43:12.770]  And then they actually made a preparation of resin dry,
[43:13.770 --> 43:14.770]  basically dry sift, like crude dry sift,
[43:15.770 --> 43:17.770]  where they shredded up this cannabis.
[43:18.770 --> 43:21.770]  And they compared and they exposed it to different
[43:22.770 --> 43:26.770]  temperatures and light exposure.
[43:27.610 --> 43:30.610]  And then they determined that without oxygen exposed
[43:31.610 --> 43:35.610]  and light exposure, it can go for a year or two or more.
[43:36.610 --> 43:41.610]  And the crust of the temple ball actually does
[43:42.610 --> 43:44.610]  keep the THC in there longer.
[43:45.610 --> 43:46.610]  I'm not being a good vessel of knowledge
[43:47.610 --> 43:48.610]  for this scientific paper.
[43:49.610 --> 43:50.610]  You got it.
[43:51.610 --> 43:52.610]  You pretty much got it.
[43:53.610 --> 43:54.610]  It kind of seals it.
[43:55.450 --> 43:57.450]  It kind of locks it in.
[43:58.450 --> 44:00.450]  That's what keeps that curing and the aging.
[44:01.450 --> 44:04.450]  A lot of things that are just a part of this
[44:05.450 --> 44:06.450]  other side of cannabis.
[44:07.450 --> 44:08.450]  I guess that's the traditional side.
[44:09.450 --> 44:11.450]  And why it was so potent.
[44:12.450 --> 44:14.450]  We're kind of like in the high THC era,
[44:15.450 --> 44:18.450]  where the extractions or the isolations
[44:19.450 --> 44:20.450]  or whatever you want to call them,
[44:21.450 --> 44:22.450]  they have always came through with a higher THC.
[44:23.290 --> 44:25.290]  And we're doing sensamelia plants too,
[44:26.290 --> 44:27.290]  which is always the big thing.
[44:28.290 --> 44:30.290]  Most other land race things,
[44:31.290 --> 44:33.290]  where we seeded crops didn't have as high THC.
[44:34.290 --> 44:35.290]  So it was always a little different too
[44:36.290 --> 44:37.290]  on that side of quality and potency.
[44:38.290 --> 44:40.290]  But it's something to think about for sure.
[44:41.290 --> 44:42.290]  And it's something to test.
[44:43.290 --> 44:44.290]  And over the years, I'm going to be doing it.
[44:45.290 --> 44:50.290]  And just try to have stuff come out of the ground
[44:51.130 --> 44:53.130]  from time to time and become a part of the party.
[44:54.130 --> 44:56.130]  And we'll all enjoy it and kind of just give thanks.
[44:57.130 --> 44:58.130]  But it would be cool to send a little bit away
[44:59.130 --> 45:00.130]  for testing here and there
[45:01.130 --> 45:03.130]  to kind of see the levels of things change over time.
[45:04.130 --> 45:07.100]  For sure.
[45:10.100 --> 45:11.100]  But in the meantime.
[45:12.100 --> 45:14.100]  How do you check on that, man?
[45:15.100 --> 45:17.100]  Because when I go to like...
[45:18.100 --> 45:20.100]  So I wrap my temple balls basically like...
[45:20.940 --> 45:22.940]  I don't know, like a caramel candy kind of.
[45:23.940 --> 45:24.940]  But to where they're airtight and tied.
[45:25.940 --> 45:27.940]  And like anytime,
[45:28.940 --> 45:30.940]  even when that knot just comes undone the first time,
[45:31.940 --> 45:34.940]  it's almost like it just will completely bring to a halt
[45:35.940 --> 45:36.940]  the curing process.
[45:37.940 --> 45:39.940]  Even if I were to just like take a small piece of that hash
[45:40.940 --> 45:41.940]  and then tie it back up,
[45:42.940 --> 45:44.940]  it's never the same as that first time you open that thing up.
[45:45.940 --> 45:47.940]  No, so what I've done is break the batch down
[45:48.780 --> 45:49.780]  to do smaller sizes.
[45:50.780 --> 45:51.780]  And then you just crack one,
[45:52.780 --> 45:54.780]  a third of it at a time or a fifth of it at a time.
[45:55.780 --> 45:57.780]  You kind of age your way into it piece by piece.
[45:58.780 --> 45:59.780]  All right.
[46:00.780 --> 46:01.780]  That's ball.
[46:02.780 --> 46:03.780]  If you can remember what the first ball was.
[46:04.780 --> 46:06.780]  It depends on how much time you put in between it all.
[46:07.780 --> 46:08.780]  But yeah, that's how I've done it in the past.
[46:09.780 --> 46:10.780]  It's just take a 40 gram ball
[46:11.780 --> 46:15.780]  and break it down into eight, five gram pieces type of thing.
[46:16.620 --> 46:17.620]  So.
[46:18.620 --> 46:19.620]  Really funny.
[46:20.620 --> 46:21.620]  A couple of comments here.
[46:22.620 --> 46:23.620]  Somebody said, funny.
[46:24.620 --> 46:25.620]  All these big growers make a six star
[46:26.620 --> 46:27.620]  and all they would rather smoke is temple,
[46:28.620 --> 46:29.620]  barrels and tobacco.
[46:31.620 --> 46:35.620]  Trust me, these guys smoke a lot of the world's greatest hash
[46:36.620 --> 46:37.620]  because I've been around them
[46:38.620 --> 46:39.620]  and I don't fuck with a lot of tobacco.
[46:40.620 --> 46:41.620]  We all smoke a lot of tobacco.
[46:42.620 --> 46:43.620]  I don't smoke a lot of tobacco.
[46:44.460 --> 46:45.460]  We all smoke a lot of hash.
[46:46.460 --> 46:47.460]  These guys,
[46:48.460 --> 46:49.460]  these guys are some of the best in the world
[46:50.460 --> 46:53.460]  and honored that we get to dig into those jars with them.
[46:55.460 --> 46:56.460]  Yeah.
[46:57.460 --> 46:58.460]  Yeah.
[46:59.460 --> 47:00.460]  One thing I wanted to bring up was that
[47:01.460 --> 47:04.460]  there is a lot of like waste in like this industry,
[47:05.460 --> 47:07.460]  you know, with like the plastics and things.
[47:08.460 --> 47:10.460]  I really like what you're talking about, Jay,
[47:11.460 --> 47:12.460]  about wrapping like with foil.
[47:13.300 --> 47:14.300]  I really like what you're talking about, Jay,
[47:15.300 --> 47:16.300]  about wrapping like with flowers
[47:17.300 --> 47:18.300]  and like trying to find other ways
[47:19.300 --> 47:20.300]  to like wrap our hash than just like plastic.
[47:21.300 --> 47:22.300]  And even with the pressing,
[47:23.300 --> 47:24.300]  when we're doing the temple balls
[47:25.300 --> 47:26.300]  and like I've been experimenting with using parchment,
[47:27.300 --> 47:28.300]  alternative plastics like sugar cane plastics.
[47:29.300 --> 47:30.300]  Has anyone else had any experience with like,
[47:31.300 --> 47:32.300]  what have y'all tried?
[47:33.300 --> 47:34.300]  Have y'all thought and been thinking,
[47:35.300 --> 47:36.300]  I'm sure along these lines of,
[47:37.300 --> 47:38.300]  you know, all these different plastics
[47:39.300 --> 47:40.300]  and stuff we're using and,
[47:41.300 --> 47:42.300]  you know, so much waste.
[47:43.300 --> 47:44.300]  I'm about to try to check out some like
[47:45.300 --> 47:46.300]  eucalyptus based cellophane.
[47:47.300 --> 47:48.300]  But like, I don't know.
[47:49.300 --> 47:50.300]  I'm worried about Terps eating it.
[47:51.300 --> 47:52.300]  I don't know.
[47:53.300 --> 47:54.300]  But yeah, it is a lot of waste.
[47:55.300 --> 47:56.300]  And like, I mean, I hate to say it,
[47:57.300 --> 47:58.300]  like for my temple balls,
[47:59.300 --> 48:00.300]  like the best plastic that I've found that
[48:01.300 --> 48:02.300]  all right, the best plastic,
[48:03.300 --> 48:04.300]  the plastic that does the thing that I like
[48:05.300 --> 48:06.300]  that it does to the hash the best
[48:07.300 --> 48:08.300]  is literally cut up ziplocks.
[48:09.300 --> 48:10.300]  Like that's the worst.
[48:11.140 --> 48:12.140]  The worst fucking ever.
[48:13.140 --> 48:14.140]  But I've never found like a really,
[48:15.140 --> 48:16.140]  a truly solid replacement for that.
[48:17.140 --> 48:18.140]  Like I've used like more brittle
[48:19.140 --> 48:20.140]  staunch feeling cellophane and stuff.
[48:21.140 --> 48:22.140]  And it's it never ties the same.
[48:23.140 --> 48:24.140]  It doesn't have that little stretch to it.
[48:25.140 --> 48:26.140]  Like, but yeah, it'd be awesome
[48:27.140 --> 48:28.140]  to find something else because I always
[48:29.140 --> 48:30.140]  feel like a dirtbag when I do that.
[48:31.140 --> 48:32.140]  Yeah.
[48:33.140 --> 48:34.140]  I mean, I've never,
[48:35.140 --> 48:36.140]  I've never seen a plastic that's
[48:37.140 --> 48:38.140]  like, you know, like,
[48:38.980 --> 48:43.750]  yeah, a lot of single,
[48:44.750 --> 48:45.750]  single use waste in this industry.
[48:46.750 --> 48:47.750]  Unfortunately, I think the solution
[48:48.750 --> 48:49.750]  to this, I hope everybody's listening.
[48:50.750 --> 48:51.750]  You need to buy bigger jars of hash
[48:52.750 --> 48:53.750]  from these guys.
[48:54.750 --> 48:55.750]  No more buying these tiny jars.
[48:56.750 --> 48:57.750]  Kick down, save up,
[48:58.750 --> 48:59.750]  going with some homies and buy
[49:00.750 --> 49:01.750]  that big ass glass jar that you can
[49:02.750 --> 49:03.750]  reuse. None of these little grams,
[49:04.750 --> 49:05.750]  two grams.
[49:06.750 --> 49:07.750]  Get it together, guys.
[49:08.750 --> 49:09.750]  This is medicine.
[49:09.750 --> 49:10.750]  It's going to help your ass.
[49:11.590 --> 49:12.590]  Bigger jars.
[49:13.590 --> 49:14.590]  I want to see all you guys offer
[49:15.590 --> 49:16.590]  bigger jars this coming year.
[49:16.590 --> 49:17.590]  2023 is the year of everybody's
[49:18.590 --> 49:19.590]  buying it out to the time.
[49:20.590 --> 49:21.590]  That's what I predict.
[49:22.590 --> 49:23.590]  Black jar.
[49:24.590 --> 49:25.590]  The black jar.
[49:26.590 --> 49:27.590]  You can do less jewelry boxes as well.
[49:28.590 --> 49:29.590]  That's what's up.
[49:30.590 --> 49:31.590]  Or to not mix cardboard with
[49:32.590 --> 49:33.590]  plastic.
[49:33.590 --> 49:34.590]  Let's not do that.
[49:35.590 --> 49:36.590]  That would be terrible.
[49:37.590 --> 49:38.590]  We're going to keep it moving
[49:39.590 --> 49:40.590]  here, you guys.
[49:41.430 --> 49:42.430]  And just like this, unfortunately,
[49:43.430 --> 49:44.430]  Resin Ranch, he's going to be
[49:45.430 --> 49:46.430]  coming in the next portion of the
[49:47.430 --> 49:48.430]  day doing his dry sip demo.
[49:49.430 --> 49:50.430]  Todd's an OG.
[49:51.430 --> 49:52.430]  They call him the Dry Sip Jedi.
[49:53.430 --> 49:54.430]  He's an OG in the dry sip game.
[49:55.430 --> 49:56.430]  They call it the king's hash.
[49:57.430 --> 49:58.430]  I've only gotten to experience it
[49:59.430 --> 50:00.430]  a handful of times, but it's
[50:01.430 --> 50:02.430]  incredible.
[50:03.430 --> 50:04.430]  There's only a handful of people
[50:05.430 --> 50:06.430]  really making it at that level in
[50:07.430 --> 50:08.430]  the world.
[50:08.430 --> 50:09.430]  And we're super honored Todd's
[50:09.430 --> 50:10.430]  going to be joining us.
[50:10.430 --> 50:16.790]  dudes, our rosin teachers. We got Ganja Gill and we got Jay Peters. You guys are gonna
[50:16.790 --> 50:20.710]  be holding it down towards the end of the day. We're gonna have a very special rosin
[50:20.710 --> 50:24.830]  press there that Jay's gonna be bringing with him that he told me about that I've got some
[50:24.830 --> 50:30.950]  history with. And I'm just super excited to have you guys. I love smoking both of your
[50:30.950 --> 50:36.310]  hash and just love hanging out with you guys. So tell us a little bit about what we've got
[50:36.310 --> 50:41.310]  in store. Gill, you're making rosin suppositories? Is that what I hear now?
[50:41.310 --> 50:52.860]  Again, I would want to talk about Temple Ball suppositories. You know, I think the full
[50:52.860 --> 51:04.140]  story is important, but to each their own. Yeah, rosin, doing rosin with Jay or rosin
[51:04.140 --> 51:10.820]  pressing with Jay. You're gonna bring a press, Jay? For real? No, you don't want me to bring
[51:10.820 --> 51:23.700]  this thing, dude. It's a fucking tank. It's a I think it's the first gen Sasquatch. Only
[51:23.700 --> 51:30.220]  the is at the top. I think only the top plate he took. This plate's like probably four inches
[51:30.220 --> 51:37.940]  thick. It's like 11 inches by like seven deep. Drops like 30 psi if you if you think
[51:37.940 --> 51:45.540]  about touching the little button for the air compressor. But he's a fucking savage. Ain't
[51:45.540 --> 51:51.260]  no ain't no finesse over there with the. I'll bring my I'll bring a hair straightener, dude.
[51:51.260 --> 51:56.500]  That's easy to bring with me, dude. I still got my vice. We can put it in, bro. Got you
[51:56.500 --> 52:03.060]  covered. And on it together, we can show you and the homie get up on top of it.
[52:03.060 --> 52:08.820]  We can get into it.
[52:08.820 --> 52:18.900]  Rosin right there. That's the legacy rosin. You know, the hair straightener taking it back,
[52:18.900 --> 52:25.340]  dude. I mean, let's be real, though. There were times where I feel like I got better color with
[52:25.340 --> 52:32.340]  a hair straightener than I did on a rosin press. Dude, I believe that. I believe that.
[52:32.340 --> 52:40.980]  I have no idea why I can't replicate it now on a press, but I don't know. I'm using a
[52:40.980 --> 52:50.340]  robotic press these days. Dude, the evolution of how fast rosin machines evolves, rosin
[52:50.340 --> 52:53.100]  presses evolved was miraculous.
[52:53.100 --> 53:01.300]  Yeah, well, I'm super stoked for this one, you guys. And I kind of like that that we
[53:01.300 --> 53:05.140]  might have a mystery press. I might drum up a press that neither one of you guys has worked
[53:05.140 --> 53:10.420]  on before. Make this a little more challenging, because I like that that that's really the
[53:10.420 --> 53:14.220]  point is that once you're experienced in rosin and you know how to make it, you know the
[53:14.220 --> 53:18.020]  feel and you learn these techniques, you get a little time under your belt. You can you
[53:18.020 --> 53:22.820]  can work on pretty much any rosin press. You might blow out a bag or two on your first
[53:22.820 --> 53:28.420]  press, but you're going to figure it out pretty quickly. And I've seen you guys all bounce
[53:28.420 --> 53:33.140]  around to each other's places and work on each other's equipment. And I've seen experienced
[53:33.140 --> 53:37.340]  hashishians know how to do that. So super excited to get you guys here sharing your
[53:37.340 --> 53:46.260]  skills and showing us how you do that squish, man. Yeah. And then we're going to you guys
[53:46.260 --> 53:49.940]  got any more you want to add there? You guys been so quiet this whole show. I want to hear
[53:49.940 --> 53:53.580]  from both of you. Tell me more. Tell me what you're working on. What do you bring into
[53:53.580 --> 53:59.220]  Hash Camp? And what do you bring into enter in the hash competition? Let's hear that.
[53:59.220 --> 54:10.740]  Let's hear a little. How many grams? For you only five Gil. And does it have to be in a
[54:10.740 --> 54:17.300]  specific jar? One unlabeled jar would be nice. We're trying to encourage bigger jars.
[54:17.300 --> 54:23.780]  Remember throwback. Yeah, for sure. I didn't know like if it was supposed to be anonymous
[54:23.780 --> 54:31.940]  or so cool. Keep it anonymous. And just give us a little tease right now of what you got
[54:31.940 --> 54:49.100]  cooking up special some special ice look magic there. All right. This is like is it
[54:49.100 --> 54:54.460]  like a ball jar? Do you want to do like a myron jar? What kind of jar we doing? Yeah,
[54:54.460 --> 54:59.260]  make it see through buddy. Put your stuff on show you're not you're not trying to hide.
[54:59.260 --> 55:03.180]  This competition is going to be judged by our students. This is going to be entered by our
[55:03.180 --> 55:08.180]  teachers. And this is a real opportunity for these students to get to smoke some of the world. You
[55:08.180 --> 55:11.620]  know some of the best hash in the world. I know you guys are gonna be bringing the heat because
[55:11.620 --> 55:18.180]  this is more than bragging. That's awesome prizes. We're gonna have Adam is actually gonna walk us
[55:18.180 --> 55:21.780]  through judging and we'll talk to him in a minute here. But yeah, Gil show us what you got there.
[55:21.780 --> 55:39.180]  Show us the magic. Oh, there it is. Oh, looks pretty good. Looks pretty turpy. Don't worry,
[55:39.180 --> 55:43.220]  guys. We're not entering. Don't you don't have to worry about me and Tamara coming in with a
[55:43.220 --> 55:48.700]  weird temple ball. Here's the other fun thing we're doing here. This is one solventless category
[55:48.700 --> 55:53.380]  to run what you brung. So you can bring any kind of solventless hash you want. You can bring a
[55:53.380 --> 55:59.060]  temple ball. You could bring some hand rub charas. This is about you know, our students are going to
[55:59.060 --> 56:03.460]  judge this. A lot of these guys this is going to be the most hash experience they've ever had. And
[56:03.460 --> 56:09.140]  the first time they've ever had an experience trying any hash of this caliber. So you might
[56:09.140 --> 56:15.260]  blow some mofos away with something different that wouldn't win your normal hash competition.
[56:15.460 --> 56:22.660]  Hey, Adam, why don't you tell us a little bit about the scoring system you've been developing.
[56:22.660 --> 56:26.940]  You developed it for your coffee and donuts events that you've been doing with our friend
[56:26.940 --> 56:33.900]  from the hashish. How do I say his name? I said his name wrong. That's okay. Everybody says his
[56:33.900 --> 56:40.500]  name wrong and he's used to it. And his name is Sharagam. I believe I got that right. I saw it
[56:40.500 --> 56:46.660]  written. I was like, I will never mess up this guy's name again. And I did right here on the
[56:46.660 --> 56:52.180]  show. But we love him. Those events you've been putting on look awesome. You got one coming up in
[56:52.180 --> 56:59.380]  Colorado in January. What's the date on that? That I believe is February 11th and 12th. And
[56:59.380 --> 57:04.900]  he's gonna kill me if I'm wrong on that. Because he does all of the hard work, moderating and
[57:05.860 --> 57:13.140]  organizing these events. He thought of me about trying to create a scorecard for the smoking
[57:13.140 --> 57:19.540]  jacket, which was an event that we threw in Los Angeles. He threw in Los Angeles and I was
[57:19.540 --> 57:26.260]  lucky to be a part of it. And me and my girlfriend worked on it for quite a while. And it all spawned
[57:26.260 --> 57:33.860]  basically because I was interested in sensory evaluation all of a sudden. Even though I was,
[57:33.860 --> 57:37.620]  I didn't know it, but I was interested in it all my whole life. And everybody on here is
[57:37.620 --> 57:43.220]  interested in it too, because it's what we're doing all the time. We're trying to evaluate
[57:43.220 --> 57:49.940]  our senses and we don't put numerics on it because that would be, that would take away
[57:49.940 --> 57:57.380]  from the experience. So this does, because you're trying, what you're doing is trying to quantify
[57:57.380 --> 58:03.460]  the experience, which is almost impossible. But there are certain attributes that are very
[58:03.460 --> 58:12.740]  important. And so they're used in many industries. One of the best examples that I'd like, I guess,
[58:12.740 --> 58:18.260]  could talk about right now is body, which to me was very obscure for a long time. I didn't
[58:18.900 --> 58:24.900]  really understand what that was, but it's a whole legit attribute whenever it comes to
[58:25.540 --> 58:31.780]  sensory evaluation, especially when in the liquid world where you're, it gets weird because we talk
[58:31.780 --> 58:36.340]  about things going in and out of your mouths and smelling taints and stuff, but please forgive me.
[58:36.340 --> 58:44.420]  And if you don't mind, we'll move on from that. And basically if you, the feeling of things going
[58:44.420 --> 58:55.460]  into your mouth, like cream, milk versus water, right? Water would have a very thin body. Okay.
[58:55.460 --> 59:02.820]  Tea would have a thinner body than milk because there's fat inside the milk that rolls on your
[59:02.820 --> 59:09.940]  tongue physically because you have mechanical, I forget what they're called, mechanoreceptors or
[59:09.940 --> 59:14.420]  something like that, literally on your tongue, not just tasting. You don't just tasting,
[59:15.380 --> 59:21.700]  you also feel them. And that contributes to flavor. And flavor is the whole experience,
[59:22.340 --> 59:26.900]  right? It's the tasting, the smell. The smells are very, very important. The aroma,
[59:26.900 --> 59:31.540]  fragrance and aroma. So yeah, I will be talking about stuff like that. And I don't know how
[59:32.100 --> 59:38.420]  much you want me to go off on that. Obviously I will, I'd love to talk about it more,
[59:38.660 --> 59:44.900]  what fragrance and aroma, maybe I can talk about that, whatever. It's 70, it's like 60 to 70%
[59:44.900 --> 59:51.300]  of the flavor because the aroma is so important. So there's all these fun things that are,
[59:52.020 --> 59:58.340]  that we're doing that we're not knowing. And I am totally an amateur on it by no means am I
[59:58.340 --> 01:00:08.260]  professional evaluator of the sensory experience, but I like to, I am getting better at it.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:14.500]  And you can go to hashishin.com and print out the scorecard that I'm created, that I'm talking
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:20.180]  about right now and learn all the attributes and the definitions, and then flip it over and you
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:25.460]  have a bunch of scorecards and you can just get the work printed off at your house. But basically
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:32.900]  there's three main points to this, to just a scorecard. And it really is to just to better,
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:39.140]  to hopefully better explain the flavors and the aromas that we're experiencing whenever we're
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:47.380]  having these experiences like dabbing or smoking flour. And for Joey's Heal Thyself and Tamara's
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:53.300]  Heal Thyself Gardens experience, I was approached to bring a scorecard to that as well. So I
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:59.300]  hybridized the scorecard, made it shorter because it's just an hour long. I believe the competition,
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.860]  I could be wrong, but it's a short competition and I wanted to account for that. So I removed a
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:10.820]  bunch of attributes and it's not going to be quite as in depth and it is a flour and concentrate
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:17.620]  hybrid mini scorecard that is going to be fun to, you can put flavor notes and aroma notes down and
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:26.550]  try to evaluate the experience. Hopefully. Yeah, we're super excited about that, Adam. And thank
[01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:32.630]  you for developing that and making a card that we can do for our flour competition and our hash
[01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:38.790]  competition. That's really cool. Yeah. I want to encourage everyone to go to coffeeanddonuts.com
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:44.390]  or no, the hashishin.com is where they can download those scoring cards, tasting cards.
[01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:55.870]  Yes, the hashishin.com, the Hashishin podcast website. Yeah, definitely. Melton was just hired
[01:01:55.870 --> 01:02:01.870]  on. Chiragam and I just hired on Melton John as a reporter for Coffee and Donuts. He's an amateur
[01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:11.230]  reporter, really big fan of hash. And, oh, sweet. Did I pull it? Awesome. Yes, this is it.
[01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:16.750]  So sweet that we can do this. Yeah, walk us through that card a little bit.
[01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:23.870]  Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I tried to, so see how it's, just keep it on that first page there. Yeah.
[01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:31.230]  Okay. So not to go off too much, but the most important part is the horizontal scale. See the,
[01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:34.030]  there's a vertical scales and horizontal scales on the left.
[01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:40.190]  The horizontal scales are used to rate the quality and that's the most important part,
[01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:44.750]  right? So if you're confused with the vertical scales, just skip them. You don't even need,
[01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:52.750]  the vertical scales are used to measure intensity. So we could go into an example.
[01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:57.070]  I don't know if you can zoom in, but fragrance and aroma is an example where I can go into what
[01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:05.470]  intensity is for this particular attribute. And for this specifically, I define fragrance as
[01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:10.590]  just the dry fragrance. Like if you were, if we were talking about flower, it would just be
[01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:16.590]  popping the lid of the jar and smelling the jar. That would be in this case, the fragrance is what
[01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:22.510]  I like to define it as for this experience. We can define it other ways too, but for this, it's
[01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:27.230]  fragrance is just like kind of the ambient room, like you're in room temperature. You haven't
[01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:34.430]  heated it yet. You haven't infused it with heat at all. So there, if you can't really see it on
[01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:41.710]  here, but there's an ambient intensity scale and it's vertical on the fragrance. And so you could,
[01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:46.430]  if you wanted to be like, okay, I think the intensity of the fragrance is, you know,
[01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:53.470]  mild or whatever. And then the aroma is another important part of that attribute where you do
[01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:58.670]  infuse it with heat. Now imagine when you break down flower or you put it in a grinder or whatever,
[01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:03.390]  you're infusing it with heat. And so it's no longer, you know, there's friction involved there.
[01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:09.630]  And there's all of a sudden aroma and volatile aromas that are being released that weren't being
[01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:16.030]  released during the fragrance stage. So sorry, I'm going off on that, but there's another
[01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:21.150]  heated intensity scale in that fragrance and aroma. There's also room for notes, but I just
[01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:25.950]  said like, you know, if that's confusing you guys, just the most important part is the numeric
[01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:32.190]  quality scale, which is horizontal. And so I made it like this because I don't like looking at my
[01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:38.430]  phone while I'm trying to take a dab and do all these things. And so we printed this out for
[01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:45.070]  everybody and they use pencil or pen and you can use little check marks or tick marks or little
[01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:51.630]  dots and just dot the numbers. And then you can worry about numbers after you've experienced.
[01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:58.190]  Right. So, so yeah, that's one of the attributes, you know, we can go over all 10, but it's,
[01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:04.910]  it really is pretty out there. But it, once you do it a few times, it starts to become
[01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:10.110]  second nature because it's what we all do all the time. Anyway, you know, we're the best
[01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:15.470]  judge of these things. It's, you know, you can get a lot out of the labs and stuff, but
[01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:24.190]  you know, your nose and your mouth are really, you, we are special individuals with, with tools that
[01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:34.830]  are amazing to, much more accurate than, than whatever they call the, the gas chromatographs
[01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:43.870]  or whatever, you know, I'm not very anyways, it's very, the aroma, taste, feeling, body,
[01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:49.070]  all these things contribute to flavor and flavor is an important attribute that I brought to the
[01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:56.270]  Heal Thyself scorecard too. So flavor is what I think is the most important, you know, and then
[01:05:56.270 --> 01:06:01.710]  balance. I like that one as well, because it's, it's the way all of those attributes before flavor
[01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:07.070]  balance. So like you, the way that the flavor translates, you know, whenever you breathe it
[01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:11.550]  in and out, is it really, is it really as good as it smelled, all that kind of stuff.
[01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:17.630]  And there's an overall attribute for your own personal appraisal of the sample. So you could,
[01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:22.110]  you could, you know, put a little bit of your opinion in there for that little,
[01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:27.710]  little attribute there. And then for, since we were dabbing, there's a residue attribute.
[01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:31.550]  Aftertaste, body, visuals, consistency, I kind of banged it out, but
[01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:37.310]  we'll do a little bit better job there at camp. But there's a little teaser for the, and
[01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:46.270]  sorry, I'm just rambling off now. It's late. And I last like 90 minutes, and then just I'm toast,
[01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:52.350]  but we're all good. I'm a big, big boy. We can keep going. Thank you for that, Adam. Yeah,
[01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:57.150]  we're super excited for this competition and just this gathering this weekend just to hang with you
[01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:02.750]  guys. We're going to wrap it up for the evening. It's been an awesome time hanging with you guys.
[01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:06.030]  You guys are not just some of my favorite hashmakers. You guys are some of my favorite
[01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:11.310]  people. We love you guys. We look forward to kicking it with you this weekend at Camp Heal
[01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:16.350]  Thyself. Ticket sales end tomorrow night at midnight. There's still a few tickets left. If
[01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:20.590]  anybody wants some, you can hit me up at the Humboldt local 2.0 on Instagram.
[01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:26.830]  Yeah, we love you guys. We can't wait to just get super hashy all weekend. Any party words from any
[01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:30.430]  of you guys? You got anything you want to say? Anything coming up you want to plug while I got
[01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:39.950]  you here? You look very relaxed. Dude, it's getting late. I don't know. Okay, it looks like
[01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:45.150]  it's going to be a wet weekend. You got the mud pit set up, Joey? You got a designated area,
[01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:50.670]  dude, to get weird or what? Yeah, we got a little mini swimming pool. We're going to fill it up.
[01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:56.430]  Gil, can you zoom in on that photo, that picture that's hanging on the wall behind you there?
[01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:14.440]  You paint that one, Gil? It's beautiful. Yeah, I painted it when I was younger,
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.200]  like probably like 21 or something when I was in art school, actually.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:24.600]  Wow. Wow, beautiful. All right, man. Well, we're so excited to hang with all you guys.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:31.640]  We're so excited to hang with all your talented hashishans and artists. You're a real extract
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:38.440]  artist, Gil. You really- Dude, I am. I'm just excited, though, that you have a K&F Jadam
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:47.560]  mud pit set up for the weekend, dude. Going to get weird. Mushroom camp. You got the bleach on
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:54.120]  the humanure. It's going to be pretty amazing. Yeah, we've got Friday. We've got shroom camp.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.560]  We've got a pretty stacked lineup of people from the psychedelic space, people from the edible
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:05.560]  space, medicinals, people talking about mycelium. We're really covering all kinds of stuff on
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:11.320]  Friday. Saturday is our regen camp where we talk a lot about natural farming practices,
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:15.320]  how to cut those expenses and make your own inputs, close those loops.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.640]  Sunday is your guy's day, hash camp, the big hash day, which we've sold more tickets for than the
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.080]  other day. I'll just tell you that right now to make you guys feel better. The people want hash.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.920]  The people have spoken and they want hash. We're just excited to be bringing you guys
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.480]  down here to Lake County and just have this celebration of hash. Yeah, we love you guys.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.720]  I want to thank you all for joining us tonight. I know it's late. I know you guys are working hard.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:49.400]  Hopefully, Peter can get up in here and wrap us up. We love you guys. We'll see you this weekend.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:54.440]  Thank you, Peter, for holding the space for us. We appreciate you, man. There it is. Peter's ready.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.680]  I'm like, if only I didn't have three kids.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.760]  We've got five between us. We have our blessing.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.160]  Is that bowl coming?
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.400]  I can't come up.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.000]  I ordered a couple more in the mail and they haven't got here yet.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:22.280]  Can we just take another dab together? God, it's so fun. I just keep rattling my mouth off about
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:28.840]  There will be opportunities to smoke Peter's hookah, though, because it's prime time to
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.840]  announce we're going to take the Regen Show on the road. January 29th, we're going to be taking
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:42.280]  a bunch of you guys and a bunch of our Sesh fam down to LA for the SoCal Seed Sesh. We're really
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.720]  excited to take a bunch of our regenerative farmers, a bunch of our favorite hash makers,
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:50.040]  a bunch of our mushroom fans, and come set up down there at SoCal. We're going to have some
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.320]  speakers during the day. We're going to do our talks and our panels. I'm just really excited to
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.960]  bring some of this down there and hang with you, Peter. Bring that hookah. We're going to get
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:05.880]  stashy on your home turf. That's January 29th. We'll be releasing some info about that one soon.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.840]  It's funny, before we went live, I meant to put that in my little calendar.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.760]  Then because you were talking about it again, I was like, ah, that's what I was going to do
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:23.320]  like two hours ago. Mark it down, my man. Yes, I will be at that one. Appreciate you. Appreciate
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:30.280]  everybody. Emerald Cup. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, we'll see you there. We're teaching in the Rage
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:36.120]  Lounge on Sunday. Tamara's working in the 101 booth doing massage, area 101 area.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.840]  Massage and rafting. Come on over and get a little love, Don. Yeah,
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:48.120]  hear this out. I'm speaking on a License to Farmer panel on Sunday at 5 o'clock. We've got
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.760]  an action-packed harvest call. We're really looking forward to it. We're looking forward
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:58.280]  to seeing all you guys there, too. Thanks again, Peter. Thanks again, y'all. We're going to fire
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.880]  one last one up here on our way out. All right, everyone. Have a good night.
